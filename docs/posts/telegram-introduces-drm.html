<p>Today&#39;s update brings tools to <strong>prevent others from saving content</strong> in groups and channels, the ability to <strong>delete messages from specific dates</strong>, new ways to <strong>manage your connected devices</strong>, an option to <strong>post anonymously</strong> in public groups on behalf of your channel and more. </p>
<h3><a name="protected-content-in-groups-and-channels" href="#protected-content-in-groups-and-channels"><i></i></a>Protected Content in Groups and Channels</h3>
<p>With this update, we&#39;re helping creators protect the content they publish on Telegram and ensure that it is available only for their <strong>intended audience</strong>.</p>
<p>Group and Channel owners who want to keep their content <strong>members-only</strong> can <strong>restrict message forwarding</strong> from their chat, which also <strong>prevents screenshots</strong> and <strong>limits the ability to save media</strong> from posts.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>To change users&#39; ability to forward messages open the <em>Group or Channel Info page &gt; Group / Channel Type &gt; Restrict Saving Content</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="delete-messages-by-date" href="#delete-messages-by-date"><i></i></a>Delete Messages by Date</h3>
<p>Telegram users have <a href="https://t.me/durov/102">complete control</a> over their digital footprint and can delete any messages from a conversation at any time. With this update, you can <strong>clear chat history</strong> from a <strong>specific day</strong> or <strong>date range</strong> in any <strong>one-on-one chat</strong>.</p>


<p>To open the calendar, tap the <strong>date bar</strong> that pops up as you scroll through the chat â€“ then choose which days to clear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearing history by date currently only works in one-on-one chats, but messages in <strong>any chat</strong> can be set to <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/autodelete-inv2#auto-delete-messages">auto-delete</a> one day, week, or month after sending.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="manage-connected-devices" href="#manage-connected-devices"><i></i></a>Manage Connected Devices</h3>
<p>You can use Telegram on all your devices at the same time, and the <strong>Devices</strong> menu helps you control where your account is logged in. We&#39;ve added a new button to quickly <a href="https://desktop.telegram.org/"><strong>link a desktop device</strong></a> and a setting to <strong>automatically log out</strong> inactive devices after some time.</p>


<p>Tap any device in the list to view more information and toggle whether it can <strong>accept calls</strong> or <strong>new Secret Chats</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Telegram is available for every platform â€“ check out <a href="https://telegram.org/apps">telegram.org/apps</a> to download the app on your other devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="anonymous-posting-in-public-groups" href="#anonymous-posting-in-public-groups"><i></i></a>Anonymous Posting in Public Groups</h3>
<p><a href="https://t.me/TelegramTips/300">Public Groups</a> and <a href="https://t.me/TelegramTips/209">Channel Comments</a> allow for discussions of any topic in massive communities with thousands of members. These groups are used for everything from <strong>defending democracy</strong> to <strong>chatting with fans</strong>, which is why we&#39;ve added the ability to appear <strong>as a channel</strong> when sending messages in these chats.</p>


<p>Tap the profile picture next to the message bar and choose one of your channels â€“ the messages you send after that will appear with the <strong>name</strong> and <strong>photo of the channel</strong> instead of your personal account.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When posting as your channel, youâ€™ll also see the channel name at the top of your message bubbles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="new-ways-to-log-in-via-call" href="#new-ways-to-log-in-via-call"><i></i></a>New Ways to Log In via Call</h3>
<p>Starting today, some mobile devices will be offered the option to receive a <strong>login call</strong> from Telegram and then enter several digits of the <strong>phone number that called</strong> â€“ instead of getting codes via text message.</p>


<h3><a name="responses-to-join-requests" href="#responses-to-join-requests"><i></i></a>Responses to Join Requests</h3>
<p>When you <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/shared-media-scrolling-calendar-join-requests-and-more#join-requests-for-groups-and-channels">request to join</a> a group or channel and its admin responds with a message, you will see <strong>which community they are from</strong> at the top of the chat.</p>


<p>As of this update, <strong>bot admins</strong> can contact users requesting to join a chat where they are an admin â€” even if the user didn&#39;t communicate with the bot before. This opens up endless possibilities: from simply accepting the <strong>rules of a group chat</strong> before joining, to passing an <a href="https://telegram.org/tour/quizbot">admission test</a>, to making a small <a href="https://t.me/donate">donation</a> to the creators of a channel.</p>
<h3><a name="global-chat-themes-on-android" href="#global-chat-themes-on-android"><i></i></a>Global Chat Themes on Android</h3>
<p>Our September update introduced <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/chat-themes-interactive-emoji-read-receipts#chat-themes">8 new themes</a> that you could set for individual chats â€“ and now they&#39;re available for your <strong>entire app</strong> on Android (iOS users received this in the <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/shared-media-scrolling-calendar-join-requests-and-more#global-chat-themes-on-ios">previous update</a>).</p>
<p>Chat Settings have been <strong>fully redesigned</strong>, giving the new themes center stage. Built by the Telegram Team, every theme has a <strong>Day</strong> and <strong>Night mode</strong>, colorful animated background and gradient message bubbles.</p>


<p>Like all themes, you can <strong>personalize</strong> these designs and tweak the colors or change the pattern. For more options and custom settings, tap â€˜Browse Themesâ€™ to <strong>edit</strong> and <strong>share</strong> your creations.</p>
<h3><a name="text-recognition-on-ios-13" href="#text-recognition-on-ios-13"><i></i></a>Text Recognition on iOS 13+</h3>
<p>On devices with iOS 13 and above, <strong>Text Recognition</strong> (Live Text) is enabled for photos in Telegram chats, allowing you to quickly select, copy and search without touching your keyboard. This image recognition is securely handled entirely on your device. </p>


<p>The list of supported languages is managed by Apple, so if yours isn&#39;t in the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-vn/HT212630">list</a> yet, stay tuned for future OS updates.</p>
<h3><a name="format-text-in-media-captions-on-ios" href="#format-text-in-media-captions-on-ios"><i></i></a>Format Text in Media Captions on iOS</h3>
<p>A little bit of <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italics</em> can add just the right emphasis to a message, and now you can use <strong>all text formatting options</strong> in media captions as well â€“ including text links.</p>


<p>Before you ask why Android isn&#39;t getting this feature â€“ it&#39;s because Android already has it. <img src="https://telegram.org/img/emoji/40/F09F9889.png" width="20" height="20" alt="ðŸ˜‰"/></p>
<h3><a name="redesigned-contact-info-on-ios" href="#redesigned-contact-info-on-ios"><i></i></a>Redesigned Contact Info on iOS</h3>
<p>Contacts, Groups and Channels have updated <strong>info pages</strong> with a new look in the style of <strong>iOS 15</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://telegram.org/file/464001060/3/QC-Rf29SkZI.79997/621b97e1d8c65987c5" target="_blank"><img src="https://telegram.org/file/464001263/2/Lse-7vtHFa8.32181/6ebc8fd5691eb2ccfc" title="Square is the new black, apparently." alt="Redesigned contact info on iOS" srcset="/file/464001060/3/QC-Rf29SkZI.79997/621b97e1d8c65987c5 , 2x"/></a>
</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for now. Let&#39;s see how many more features we can build for you this year.</p>
