    <h1>API Shouldn&#39;t Redirect HTTP to HTTPS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        When an user directs their web browser to an HTTP URL, it&#39;s a common practice for the service to redirect the
        request to a corresponding HTTPS page. This unencrypted part of the communication flow has its flaws. Third
        parties in shared networks, as well as network intermediaries, could
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniffing_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sniff</a>
        passwords and other secrets from the initial HTTP traffic
        or even impersonate the web server with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MITM</a> attack.
        Nevertheless, redirection has been an useful first step in the transition from the largely unencrypted early web
        to the <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely encrypted</a> web of today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later techniques tightened the security story further. Servers can now send <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HSTS</a> along with the initial HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection response, telling the
        user&#39;s browser to use only HTTPS for that domain from
        then on. This limits the window of opportunity for trivial sniffing and MITM attacks to the first request.
        Browsers then added <a href="https://hstspreload.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HSTS preload
          lists</a> and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/https-only-prefs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTPS-Only modes</a> that allow skipping the initial unencrypted request altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the perspective of usability-security tradeoff it all makes sense for user-facing sites. But interestingly,
        the redirection approach also appears to be widely adopted for APIs. APIs are mostly consumed by other software
        so the same usability arguments don&#39;t apply there. Moreover, many programmatic API clients don&#39;t tend to keep
        browser-like state of things like HSTS headers they have seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        This post argues that, due to these factors, the common practice of redirecting API calls from HTTP to
        HTTPS should be reconsidered. While the post mostly refers to REST APIs, its points also apply to other styles
        of APIs that use HTTP(S) as a transport mechanism.
      </p>

      <h2>A Simple Typo Is Enugh</h2>
      <p>
        At <a href="https://badrap.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work</a>, we were building a new
        integration against a third-party API. The initial code commit contained a mistyped API base URL
        <code>&#34;http://...&#34;</code> instead of <code>&#34;https://...&#34;</code>. A pretty easy mistake to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        The error was essentially masked during runtime: The third-party API responded to every request with a 301
        redirect to their HTTPS side. Node.js&#39;s built-in <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/globals.html#fetch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fetch</a>
        happily and <em>quietly</em> followed those redirects to the HTTPS endpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Every single one of our API requests now sent the API keys over the network in plaintext</strong>,
        before then sending them again to the encrypted endpoint. The one letter omission could have exposed the used
        API keys to third parties without us realizing it. As the integration would have worked, there&#39;s a good
        chance that code would have leaked any secrets in the API calls for years. In the long run, the
        probabilities for malice tend to accumulate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily we spotted the error during the code review before the error could propagate to production or even
        testing. We also realized that our <em>own</em> API also did similar HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects.
      </p>

      <h2>The Fail-fast Principle</h2>
      <p>
        When an API redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS - and the API client silently follows those redirects - it tends to
        hide mistyped URLs like in the case described above. A simple one-letter omission can easily be ignored, end up
        in production, and compromise the entire system&#39;s confidentiality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases, it&#39;s better to adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fail-fast principle</a>: unencrypted API calls should fail in a
        spectacular and visible way so that the developer can easily spot and fix the typo as early as possible during
        the development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        A great solution for failing fast would be to disable the API server&#39;s HTTP interface altogether and not even
        answer to connections attempts to port 80. If the initial unencrypted connection is never established then the
        API keys aren&#39;t sent, mitigating sniffing attacks and limiting the window of opportunity for MITM attacks to an
        extremely small time window. This approach is viable for APIs hosted under their own domains like
        <code>api.example.com</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our own API was served under the <code>/api</code> path on the same domain as our service&#39;s web UI. As such we
        didn&#39;t feel confident completely disabling the HTTP interface, so we picked the second option: All unencrypted
        HTTP requests made under <code>/api</code> path now return a descriptive error message along with the HTTP
        status code 403. Some initial plaintext requests might be made during development, but they&#39;re much easier for
        developers to notice.
      </p>
      <div id="revocation-note">
        <p>
          After the initial publication of this post, Hacker News user u/zepton <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40505525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made a great
            point:
          </a>
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
          Indeed! Any API keys sent unencrypted over the public internet should be considered compromised and
          get automatically revoked on the spot. An error message in the API response is a great place to inform the
          API consumer both to fix their URL and get new keys after that.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Who Else?</h2>
      <p>
        That took care of our own API. We also pinged the third-party API provider and a couple of friends that they
        might want to check their APIs. And who knows, maybe there were some commonly used APIs that accept API keys (or
        other credentials) and also redirect from HTTP to HTTPS?
      </p>
      <p>
        I listed a bunch of well-known APIs from the top of my head and did a little survey. Several of them returned
        HTTP errors or declined to connections altogether. They&#39;re listed here with cURL spells for checking out their
        detailed responses:
      </p>

          </li>

      <p>
        I didn&#39;t report these findings separately to all of these API providers. There were some outliers not listed
        here that I did contact, with varying results. More on that later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take each individual result with a grain of salt: I had to test some of these APIs without valid
        credentials, or with credentials used in documentation examples. But the overall pattern indicates that the
        habit of APIs redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS is quite widespread. Why is that?
      </p>

      <h2>Best Practices Need Practice Too</h2>
      <p>
        When speaking with people about this topic, many have noted that HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects from APIs have obvious
        downsides - in hindsight.
      </p>
      <p>Redirects for user-facing applications are often mentioned in lists best practices and cheat sheets, <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#use-tls-for-all-pages" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">like the ones published by OWASP (The Open Worldwide Application
          Security Project)</a>.
        Recommendations specifically aimed for APIs seem rare in contrast. I found just few mentions, for example an
        excellent PDF slideset called <a href="https://owasp.org/www-chapter-belgium/assets/2018/2018-10-23/OWASP_20181023_CommonAPISecurityPitfalls.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">&#34;Common API Security Pitfalls&#34;</a> by <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@PhilippeDeRyck" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Philippe De
          Ryck</a>,
        buried deep within the OWASP website:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img alt="Slide 8 of &#34;Common API Security Pitfalls&#34;: &#34;API-only endpoints should disable HTTP and only need to support HTTPS.&#34;" src="https://jviide.iki.fi/deryck-slide-8.png"/>

            section.
          </small>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        My Google-fu might just be bad. But maybe each best practice item recommending HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects
        for user-facing sites should have an explicit caveat attached, prominently advising against such redirects for
        APIs. Therefore I opened <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/issues/1407" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">an issue</a> that suggests amending OWASP&#39;s Transport Layer Security Cheat Sheet
        accordingly.
      </p>

      <h2>Bonus Round: Popular APIs That Respond In Plaintext</h2>
      <p>
        While reviewing the list of APIs, I bumped into some popular ones that neither redirected nor failed
        unencrypted requests. They just responded to unencrypted HTTP requests with unencrypted HTTP responses, without
        enforcing HTTPS at any stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe they had their reasons, or maybe they had just accidentally misconfigured their reverse proxies.
        Regardless, seeing that they all handle potentially sensitive data, I contacted these API providers through
        their respective security channels and explained the problem. The providers are listed below in the order of
        reporting. I&#39;ll unredact their names and details when they&#39;ve given a definite response, or otherwise after
        a reasonable amount of time has passed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Provider A</strong>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-17">2024-05-17</time> through their
          vulnerability reporting email address. Awaiting response.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provider B</strong>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-21">2024-05-21</time> through their HackerOne
          program. Got a prompt triage response, stating that attacks requiring MITM (or physical access to a user&#39;s
          device) are outside the scope of the program. Sent back a response explaining that MITM or physical access was
          not required for sniffing. Awaiting response.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provider C</strong>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-21">2024-05-21</time> through their security
          email address. Awaiting response.
        </li>
        <li id="virustotal">
          <a href="https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirusTotal
            API</a>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-21">2024-05-21</time> through Google&#39;s <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bug Hunters</a> site
          (VirusTotal is owned by a Google subsidiary that got merged into Google Cloud). The
          API responds in plaintext to requests like for example this (where <code>$API_KEY</code> is a valid API key):

          <p>
            <code>
              curl -i -H &#39;x-apikey: $API_KEY&#39; http://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/ip_addresses/1.1.1.1
            </code>
          </p>

          <p>
            The report got promptly triaged. Received a response on <time datetime="2024-05-24">2024-05-24</time>, cited
            in part below:
          </p>

          
          
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS for APIs can be more harmful than helpful due to the nature of APIs. Unlike
        user-facing web pages, APIs are primarily consumed by other software. API clients often follow redirects
        automatically and do not maintain state or support security headers like HSTS. This can lead to silent failures
        where sensitive data in each API request is initially transmitted in plaintext over the network, unencrypted.
      </p>

        Let&#39;s adopt a fail-fast approach and disable the HTTP interface entirely or return clear
        error responses for unencrypted requests. This ensures that developers can quickly notice and fix accidental
        use <code>http://</code> URLs to <code>https://</code>. We should consider API credentials sent over unencrypted
        connections compromised and revoke them on the spot, automatically.

        Several well-known and popular APIs did redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS at the time of writing this post. This
        behavior seems to be widespread. Maybe it&#39;s time we amend best practices to explicitly recommend that APIs flat
        out refuse to handle unencrypted requests.
