    <h1>Ask HN: How to deal with burnout and its consequences?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey HN,</p><p>Earlier this year I burned out hard and spectacularly, having nothing short of a total breakdown and being forced to take many, many months of medical leave by my GP.</p><p>My job wasn&#39;t overly difficult, but the corporate environment I found myself in was something I&#39;d never done before and it was completely unsuited to me as an individual. It is the worst working experience I&#39;ve ever been through.</p><p>I returned to my job late last month and I find that I simply don&#39;t care anymore. My burnout was never really fixed despite the time off. I&#39;m unable to accomplish even basic tasks at work now and truthfully I&#39;m at a point where I don&#39;t even care if I get fired. In the time I&#39;ve been back I think I&#39;ve been able to close one of two tiny tickets, the rest of the time I&#39;ve literally done nothing.</p><p>During my time off I&#39;ve been poked and prodded by psychologists and they seem to think I have ADHD and that it was a large contributing factor to this, though I&#39;m not completely sure I buy this explanation.</p><p>I&#39;m not well off like most people on here, I can survive 4-6 months with no salary, which I&#39;m likely going to have to consider given my firing seems imminent at this point. I simply don&#39;t think I&#39;m capable of maintaining this job anymore.</p><p>I really don&#39;t know how to get over this and how to move past it. I feel quite literally incapable of working. My mind knows what needs to be done, but my body says no and I am overwhelmed by apathy. I&#39;m honestly not sure if I&#39;m capable of working in tech anymore at this point and that&#39;s doing quite a number of any selfesteem I had.</p><p>Truthfully I didn&#39;t know things could get this bad. I&#39;m trying to figure out what my future even looks like and how to move past this and any advice would be really appreciated.</p></div></div></div>
