						Oh boy, there&#39;s a lot to say!
					</p>
					<p>
						My name is Sean, and I&#39;m a 32 year old software developer.  Most of my
						career has been in web development, but ever since I was a young lad
						slinging code in upstate New York, I&#39;ve dreamed of making games.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to realize this dream -- and, honestly, just to have some fun too
						-- I&#39;ve decided to sell all my <em>shit</em>, buy a van, build it out, and
						travel around the United States.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because, why not?  Fuck it.  You only get one life, so you might as well
						have some fun, and chase your crazy dreams.  Does anyone actually
						<em>enjoy</em> being in a cubicle, all day?
					</p>
					<h2>About This Document</h2>
					<p>
						I have attempted to catalog the build process of the van, in hopes that it
						will be useful in some sense, to someone, somewhere.  Even at the very least
						of curing your boredom, temporarily, while you sit in your cubicle and
						pretend to work.
					</p>
					<p>
						I will be documenting the build process in chronological order.  This means
						the pictures will progress correctly, and make sense.  But it also means
						that if you&#39;re looking for one particular piece of information (e.g., how
						to setup a solar panel system), you will have to hunt down the appropriate
						tid-bits of information.
					</p>
					<p>
						This document is long.  You don&#39;t have to read the whole thing.  Relax.
						Just look at the pictures, or skip around.  It&#39;s not that serious.

					<p>
						This story starts in September of 2014, when I began to internalize the
						realization that my college loan -- my last piece of debt -- would be paid
						off in December.
					</p>
					<p>
						Well, except my mortgage.
					</p>
					<p>
						I would be ringing in the New Year a <em>Free Man</em>.  The first time in
						my adult life with no sense of <em>servitude</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was certainly happy, for obvious reasons, but another part of me was truly
						terrified.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was terrified because I no longer had an excuse.  I had to take complete
						responsibility for my life.  I couldn&#39;t blame my situation on the idea that
						I had to pay my bills, because all my bills were under my complete control.
					</p>
					<p>
						&#34;Paying off my debt&#34; was my prime motivating factor for a large part of my
						adult life, and now that it was going to be paid off -- except for my
						mortgage -- I had some digging to do.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a <em>Free Man</em>, what type of life do I want to create?  What&#39;s
						important to me?  And what is this nagging dreadful feeling of death and
						doom that I feel looming over me, all the time? :-)
					</p>
					<h2>My Sister</h2>
					<p>
						Around this same time, my older Sister was going through her own
						self-actualization.
					</p>
					<p>
						Her solution: Sell/give/toss everything, buy an RV, and travel the
						United States, with her husband and children.
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						&#34;For those who understand, no explanation is necessary; for those who don&#39;t
						understand, no explanation is possible.&#34;
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						I thought the idea was genius.  <em>Not for me</em>, I said, but genius.
					</p>
					<p>
						With the impending New Year existential crisis, and the seed of minimalism
						and travelling planted by my Sister, I began to explore the idea a little
						more seriously.
					</p>
					<h2>Testing the Waters</h2>
					<p>
						It does sound crazy at first... but damn it all, if it won&#39;t nag you, in the
						background...
					</p>
					<p>
						&#34;How would I shower?&#34;
					</p>
					<p>
						&#34;Well shit, I go to the gym a lot already... I could just shower there...&#34;
					</p>
					<p>
						&#34;How would I cook?&#34;
					</p>
					<p>
						&#34;Hell, if I was travelling all the time, I could buy food fresh, every other
						day...&#34;
					</p>
					<p>
						&#34;What about using the restroom?&#34;
					</p>
					<p>
						&#34;There are toilets everywhere... Maybe not as clean, but not the end of the
						world...&#34;
					</p>
					<p>
						Slowly, my subconscious mind, sorting out all these little details... Until
						a question would bubble up to awareness, demanding a tiny experiment:
					</p>
					<h3><em>How big of a fridge would I need?</em></h3>
					<p>
						Off to Lowes!  Buy a mini-fridge, 1.7 cubic feet.  Throw away all my food,
						and cram what I need into the fridge.  Does it fit?  Does it work?  Can I
						live this way?  Try it out for a month...
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/fridge.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Yes... it fits.  This could work.
					</p>
					<h3><em>How big is a van, anyways?</em></h3>
					<p>
						Off to the dealerships!  Look at the latest models.  Take measurements.
						Nissan NV2500, Ford Transit, Dodge RAM ProMaster...
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/nv2500.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/transit.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/promaster.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						NV2500 was a bit small... Transit was a bit big... ProMaster felt good,
						actually!
					</p>
					<h3><em>Can I live without my precious possessions?</em></h3>
					<p>
						Pile up my crap.  Anytime I need something in the pile, take it out of the
						pile and save it for later.  Monitor usage.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/crap.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/crap2.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Surprisingly, I didn&#39;t miss a thing.
					</p>
					<h3><em>What does it feel like to live in a small space?</em></h3>
					<p>
						Mark off a corner in the room.  Layout something that is about right, and
						get a feel for it.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/test-layout.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Not bad.  Pretty fucking cramped... but not bad.
					</p>
					<h3 id="cani">So: Can I do this?  Seriously?</h3>
					<p>
						I would need to get rid of all my crap.
					</p>
					<p>
						I would need to fix up the house, list it, and sell it.
					</p>
					<p>
						I would need to buy a van and build it out.
					</p>
					<p>
						...
					</p>
					<p>
						Fuck it.  Let&#39;s do this thing.
					</p>
					<h2>Sell <em>All</em> The Things!</h2>
					<p>
						It takes a long time to get rid of all your crap.
					</p>
					<p>
						So much time, that I began to develop relationships with the local pawn shop
						owners.
					</p>
					<p>
						Every weekend, I would stop by, with another load of items I was willing to
						get rid of.  Things that I swore the previous week I couldn&#39;t live without.
					</p>
					<p>
						Games, consoles, DVDs, watches, TVs...
					</p>
					<p>
						Next, eBay and Craigslist... Old computers, couch, chair, bed, rugs...
					</p>
					<p>
						I sold as much as I could.  But at some point, you can&#39;t get money for
						what you&#39;re selling... No one wants it.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, off to the donation bins.  Garbage bags full of clothes, shoes, suits,
						ties... donated.  Button up shirts, still fresh from the cleaners, into the
						bin.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then the more rare items... Can I donate my books?  Call around, no one
						wants them.  Can I donate my cookware?  No... Plastic containers?  No...
					</p>
					<p>
						Try to give as much stuff to friends... but they have their own crap they&#39;re
						dealing with.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fine.  Craigslist it is, then:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/free-stuff.jpg" width="750" height="1203"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Everything else?
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/dump.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						You would be sick to your stomach if you knew how much shit I failed to
						sell, donate, or give away.  Unfortunately, a lot of my precious stuff
						wasn&#39;t so precious after all, and ended up here.
					</p>
					<h2>Fix The House, List It, Sell It</h2>
					<p>
						Don&#39;t you just love home ownership?
					</p>
					<p>
						Had to fix the sewer pipe:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/sewer.jpg" width="750" height="911"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						That was over $6,000.
					</p>
					<p>
						Had to replace the water filtration system.  Retile the bathrooms.  Repair
						walls and paint.  Powerwash the siding.  Clean the windows.  Landscaping.
						Repair scratched floors.  Clean.  And clean some more.
					</p>
					<p>
						List the house.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once listed, keep the house in a state ready to show, at any time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Negotiate a contract.
					</p>
					<p>
						Home inspection.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>More</em> repairs: GFCI, electric, plumbing, foundation, termite
						inspection, rodent inspection...
					</p>
					<p>
						Until finally, the day comes.  The house is sold, and the bittersweet
						feeling of driving away (with my truck completely overloaded).  Saying
						goodbye to <em>my home</em>.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/house.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						On May 29th, 2015, I officially had zero debt -- <em>no exceptions!</em>  I
						was also homeless.
					</p>
					<p>
						If I wasn&#39;t so exhausted from everything, I probably could have savored the
						moment a little more.
					</p>
					<p>
						...
					</p>
					<p>
						...No time.  On to the main event...
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					
					<p>
						How do you choose a van?
					</p>
					<p>
						Obviously I can only give you my opinion.  Here was my criteria:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>New -- I am a software developer, not a mechanic</li>
						<li>Solid walls all the way up -- not a fiber glass high-top</li>
						<li>Must be able to stand up in it</li>
						<li>Must look generic and boring on the outside to avoid attention</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						According to my research, that left three vans (ruling out the Sprinter
						because of the costs):
					</p>
					<h3>Nissan NV2500</h3>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/nv2500-nice.jpg" width="750" height="316"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Not bad.  However, the ceiling was a bit short for me, and I couldn&#39;t stand
						up completely.  A bit ugly too, but I suppose vans are an acquired taste in
						general.
					</p>
					<h3>Ford Transit</h3>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/transit-nice.jpg" width="750" height="316"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Tons of room, with a really high top!  But also <em>massive</em> from the
						outside.  This. Van. Is. <em>Huge</em>.
					</p>
					<h3>Dodge RAM ProMaster</h3>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/promaster-nice.jpg" width="750" height="316"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						I settled on the ProMaster.  The biggest selling point for me was the
						front-wheel drive.  This means the cargo floor is significantly lower than
						the NV or Transit, because you don&#39;t have a drivetrain going from the engine
						to the back wheels.
					</p>
					<p>
						This shaves a lot of height off the overall size of the van, compared to the
						Transit.  So you still get the standing room, but without the
						<em>massiveness</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						I closed on my house May 29th.  I drove 650 miles to my father&#39;s house on
						May 30th.  I traded in my truck for my ProMaster on May 31st:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/my-promaster.jpg" width="750" height="1000"/>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>RAM 1500 ProMaster, High Top</li>
						<li>136&#34; Wheelbase</li>
						<li>3.6-Liter V6 Gas Engine</li>
						<li>6-Speed Automatic Transmission</li>
						<li>24-Gallon Fuel Tank</li>
						<li>220-Amp Alternator</li>
						<li>Side and Back Windows</li>
						<li>Power Folding/Heated Mirrors</li>
						<li>GPS Navigation</li>
						<li>Back-Up Camera</li>
						<li>8550lbs GVWR</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Even though it&#39;s only 60 square feet, the entire build process is a lot of
						work, requires a lot of tools, and a place to sleep (since my house was
						gone).
					</p>
					<p>
						Thankfully, my Dad and Step-Mom offered to house me while the van was being
						built.  My Dad is a carpenter, and has decades of experience (and
						<em>loves</em> building projects).
					</p>
					<p>
						Without his help, the van would have looked completely amateurish -- if I
						would have been able to finish it at all!
					</p>
					<p>
						Plus it was nice to spend some quality time with my Dad.  It was a bit weird
						to live in the house, where I had last lived 11 years ago, when in college.
						But it was great to work on the project with my Dad, and I loved every
						minute.
					</p>
					<p>
						He did the wood work (&#34;the fun stuff&#34;, to him), and I worked on the smaller
						projects in parallel (electric, insulation, painting, roof rack, solar,
						etc).

						Form follows function.
					</p>
					<p>
						I figured I would be spending most of my time in the van: 1. Sleeping, and
						2. Coding.
					</p>
					<p>
						The most obvious design choice (to me) was to use my passenger seat as a
						computer chair.  Vehicle seats are designed to be comfortable for long
						stretches of time, because they assume you are driving.  I might as well
						use that same comfort to sit and code.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mounting my TV across from my rotated passenger seat would give me a dual
						screen setup for coding.
					</p>
					<p>
						Bed size and placement changed quite a bit over time, as I experimented with
						different layouts.
					</p>
					<p>
						Eventually I settled on a half-queen size bed, 30&#34; x 75&#34; x 8&#34;.  I wanted the
						bed length-wise, because I sleep on my stomach with my toes hanging off the
						end.  I also wanted a wall to lean up against, while in bed.  Bed height
						was based off of sitting upright without hitting my head.
					</p>
					<p>
						With those constraints, it was just a matter of arranging everything else
						around that.
					</p>
					<p>
						I ended up with the foot of the bed facing out the back, because I liked the
						idea of having the rear doors open while laying in bed.
					</p>
					<p>
						I opted for a gravity-fed faucet for simplicity.  I figured I could use a
						portable propane camp stove for cooking (instead of a permanent fixture).
						No bathroom or shower -- just use public facilities and my gym membership.
					</p>
					<p>
						Everything else would basically just be storage.  Oh -- and I needed space
						for my guitar and <a href="https://brompton.com">folding bike</a>, of course
						:-).
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/plan.png" width="750" height="550"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						As you can see, I used MS Paint to layout the van.  One square pixel = one
						square inch.  Very technical, I know.
					</p>

					<p>
						The ProMaster has an option on their website for a swivel seat, but no
						dealership actually <em>has</em> that option available in the real world.
					</p>
					<p>
						After some searching on the Internet, I came across others who recommended
						the EuroCamper swivel adapter:
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="http://www.eurocampers.com/2014--2015-Dodge-ProMaster-Swivel-Adapter--Front-Passenger-Seat_p_1206.html">EuroCamper ProMaster Swivel Adapter - Front Passenger</a>
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/swivel-web.png" width="750" height="378"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						It took some waiting for it to come in stock, but I pre-ordered it about a
						month before the build started, so it was delivered by the time I got the
						van.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/swivel1.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/swivel2.jpg" width="750" height="500"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						The bolts holding the seat down require a T40 socket to unscrew.  Just buy
						the damn socket!  I tried using an allen wrench, but ran into issues with
						some stripping.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/swivel3.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/swivel5.jpg" width="750" height="543"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Make sure to disconnect the battery (per the instructions), so that the
						airbags don&#39;t go off.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/swivel4.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Wait 10 minutes, then disconnect all the wires under the seat.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/swivel6.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Rip the seat off.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/swivel7.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Mounting the swivel adapter is fairly easy.  We did have to re-thread one
						hole.  The only issue was that a cross-bar would rub against the rotating
						plate.  Not really sure what the cross-bar was for -- we just hammered it
						down a little bit, to give the swivel some more clearance:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/swivel8.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Reattach the seat and wiring, pulling it through the middle of the swivel
						adapter, reconnect the battery -- and you&#39;re done!
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/swivel9.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						The adapter works great.  It rotates 360 degrees, but you don&#39;t want to
						sit and spin in circles, because it will twist and screw up your wiring.  It
						locks in place when facing forward; otherwise, it rotates with a bit of
						oomph.  The forward-backward movement of the seat remains functional, in
						alignment with the seat -- when flipped around, it&#39;s better to be all the
						way forward, so your head doesn&#39;t hit the top of the van.
					</p>
					<p>
						Heavy duty and just want I needed.  A+, would recommend.

						We thought it would be a good idea to lay everything out in cardboard, to
						get a feel for the flow of everything.
					</p>
					<p>
						This turned out to be a good idea, because we learned two specific things:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The wall between the bed and sink was originally completely vertical.
							This was very obtrusive, so we cut it at an angle.</li>
						<li>The planned location of the light switches was way too low.  We moved
							the switch panel up as high as we could afterwards, and re-wired.</li>
					</ol>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/cardboard1.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						The bed platform represents the size of the cabinets.  The bed would be
						another 8&#34; above the platform, level with the other counter tops.

						After getting the van, one of the first observations was that it comes with
						a flattened spot on the roof, towards the front:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/flat-spot.jpg" width="750" height="540"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						This seemed like an obvious location for the Fan-Tastic Fan.
					</p>
					<p>
						I had originally planned on putting the Fan-Tastic Fan in the rear, and
						cracking the windows, allowing the fan to pull air through the entire body.
					</p>
					<p>
						But with the fan towards the <em>front</em>, that plan wouldn&#39;t work quite
						as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						So we decided to cut open a rear vent in the back door.  This would mean the
						fan would pull air from the back, towards the front, (hopefully) circulating
						the air much better.
					</p>
					<p>
						Plus it gave my Dad practice in cutting holes in the van (which he was a
						nervous wreck over).

					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/rear4.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						The Fan-Tastic Fan came with a spongy material for sealing the fan to the
						roof.  We used the scrap center piece to seal the vent to the door, along
						with plenty of 100% Silicone Caulk.

						The wiring plan was simple:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/wiring.png" width="750" height="501"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						The batteries would be on the passenger side.  There would be 4 switches on
						the driver side (floor LED, bed LED, sink LED, and DC outlet).  The
						refrigerator would be hard-wired to power directly.  Additional lines were
						needed to run from the batteries to the solar panels and Fan-Tastic Fan.

						The day my father dreaded: cutting holes in the roof of my new $33k van.  I
						didn&#39;t see what the big deal was, but I suppose it was pretty easy for me
						-- I just watched, for the most part.
					</p>
					<p>
						Start small.  First, the hole for the wiring for the solar panels.  We used
						a grommet to try and protect the 12 gauge wire from rubbing against the
						metal edge.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to drill it, we wedged a 2x4 with a wooden block on top, so my Dad
						would have something to drill into.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/solar-wire1.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>

					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/solar-wire4.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Sealed everything with 100% Silicone Caulk again.  That stuff is great.
					</p>
					<h2>Ceiling Insulation</h2>
					<p>
						Quick side note:
					</p>
					<p>
						We were happy to find duct insulation for the ceiling.  It&#39;s thinner than
						regular insulation, and fit perfectly, without compression.
					</p>
					<p>
						We attached it to the ceiling using 3M spray contact adhesive.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/ceiling-insulation.jpg" width="750" height="514"/>
					</p>
					<h2>Fan-Tastic Fan</h2>
					<p>
						This:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/fan1.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Needs to go here:

					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/fan3.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						(My Dad, looking nervous)
					</p>
					
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/cutting-hole-preview.jpg" width="640" height="400" onclick="javascript: playCuttingHole(this);"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						(We taped a box below the target area, so that the sparks wouldn&#39;t go
						everywhere and burn the cloth seats)
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/fan4.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						(See Dad? That wasn&#39;t so hard :-P)
					</p>
					<p>
						Next, create a small wooden frame.  Turns out the wood was a bit too skinny
						-- you&#39;ll see why, soon.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/fan5.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Goop up the fan with our favorite: 100% Silicone Caulk.
						(EDIT: <a href="#mods">bad idea</a>).
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/fan6.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Drill into the van using metal self-tapping screws.  Missed our frame...
						oops.  Oh well, the self-tapping screws are secure enough.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/fan7.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Careful not to damage your wiring.  Oops again.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/fan8.jpg" width="750" height="464"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Silicone <em>everything</em>!
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/fan9.jpg" width="750" height="358"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						And we&#39;re done -- for now!
					</p>
					<h2>Ceiling Panels</h2>
					<p>
						We used 3 sheets of Lauan Plywood for the ceiling panels.  The first 2
						sheets were fairly straight-forward.  A few notches on the side, but they
						mostly just went right up.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/ceiling-panels1.jpg" width="750" height="817"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Again, we used the metal self-tapping screws to attach the panels to the
						cross beams.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/ceiling-panels2.jpg" width="750" height="933"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						(Don&#39;t forget to wire up the fan, before the third sheet...)
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/fan10.jpg" width="750" height="441"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						The third sheet was a bit harder.
					</p>
					<p>
						First, how to mount it?  We decided on cutting back some of the material in
						the front, uncovering a beam that we could screw to.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/ceiling-panels3.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Next, how to cut the panel to fit all the goofy edges?  We used cardboard.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/ceiling-cutout.jpg" width="750" height="188"/>
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/ceiling-panels4.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>

					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/ceiling-panels6.jpg" width="750" height="444"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Perfect!
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					
					
					<p>
						We used cardboard cutouts to get the right profile around the edge of the
						floor.
					</p>
					<p>
						Cut the 3/4&#34; plywood to size, then test to make sure it fits:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/subfloor1.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Easy peasy.
					</p>
					<p>
						I decided to use a layer of Reflectix under the plywood.  It probably
						doesn&#39;t provide much insulation, but I figured it would at least help fill
						in the gaps between the ridges on the floor.  We used 3M spray contact
						adhesive to glue it to the floor.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/subfloor2.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						To cut the last section length-wise, we put on our thinking caps.  Roll it
						up, then one cut should do it...
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/subfloor3.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/subfloor4.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						(We also used window flashing for the wheel wells -- why not?)
					</p>
					<p>
						To attach the plywood, we countersunk the metal self-tapping screws, so the
						floor would be flat.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/subfloor6.jpg" width="750" height="353"/>

						Beauty, ain&#39;t it?
					</p>

					<p>
						Used more 3M spray glue and Reflectix as the first layer of wall insulation:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/insulation1.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Framing consisted of cutting boards to the right fit, so that we would have
						something to screw the wall panelling to, without too much bending.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/framing1.jpg" width="750" height="1000"/>

					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/framing2.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>

					<p>
						(The trick is to pick the right length self-tapping screw, so that it doesn&#39;t
						go through the side of the van!)
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/framing3.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						We used plain R13 wall insulation.

						We tried coming up with different clever ways of attaching a roof rack...
						but couldn&#39;t figure out a way that was really satisfying.
					</p>
					<p>
						So... I bit the bullet, and bought the
						<a href="http://www.eurocampers.com/ProMaster-H3-Style-2-Bar-Aluminum-Roof-Rack-w-End-Caps_p_1322.html">EuroCampers
						VanTech H3 Style 2 Bar Aluminum Roof Rack</a>.

						The rack is well made, and installation is a breeze.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/rack4.jpg" width="750" height="562"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Please note, though: this rack is low-profile, and cannot be mounted in the
						front section of the van if you have a Fan-Tastic Fan -- they are clearly
						in conflict:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/rack5.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>

						solar panels.

					<p>
						It&#39;s a bit tedious, cutting out the exact sizing... but the great thing
						about building out a van is that every mini-project has an end in sight.
						There are only so many wall panels.

						Why buy an expensive awning, when you can just use a tarp and some poles?
					</p>
					<p>
						But first -- I needed to have a place to attach the awning.  So I bought
						some metal strips, painted them white, and bolted them to the roof rack:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/rack7.jpg" width="750" height="262"/>
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/rack8.jpg" width="750" height="494"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Then, just a 10&#39; x 10&#39; tarp, with some tent poles, rope, and metal hooks:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/awning2.jpg" width="750" height="408"/>

					<p>
						Tada!

						Next, the wall between the bed and sink.  We wanted this to be strong enough
						to support me leaning on it, while sitting in bed.

					<h2>Wiring</h2>
					<p>
						Wiring up the switches was easy -- once you know the trick.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/wiring6.jpg" width="750" height="281"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						The fridge is hard-wired to power.  All the white wires go together.  The
						switches break the black wire, for each circuit.  Instead of providing a
						dedicated wire to each switch, you can use a single power line and connect
						all the black wires together.
					</p>
					<p>
						Follow the diagram and you&#39;ll see what I mean:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/wiring7.jpg" width="750" height="443"/>

						The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/200W-Mono-Starter-Kit-Controller/dp/B00BCRG22A">solar
						panels came in a kit</a>, from Renogy, which included an MPPT charge
						controller.  They are 100 watts each.
					</p>
					<p>
						I bought 4 metal flat bars to mount the solar panels to the roof rack.  The
						flat bars are a bit wavey, but since the panels are mounted very close
						to the roof rack, the waviness isn&#39;t a big issue.
					</p>
					<p>
						First, attach the bars to the panels:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/panel-mount1.jpg" width="750" height="500"/>
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/panel-mount2.jpg" width="750" height="532"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Mounting to the rack was easy, due to the rack&#39;s design.  The only hard part
						was doing this in 90 degree weather.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/panel-mount3.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>

						Things didn&#39;t line up perfectly, so we had to cut longer holes.

						to white, negative to black.

						Meanwhile, my Dad worked on the bed cabinets.  He insisted on a toe kick,

						I bought my mattress from Sleepy&#39;s.  It&#39;s designed to be a platform bed, so
						no box-spring is necessary.  The dimensions are 30&#34; x 75&#34; x 8&#34; -- a
						half-queen.

						&#34;Paradise Blue&#34; for the walls, and &#34;Snowcap White&#34; for the cabinets.

					<h2>Bed Drawers</h2>
					<p>
						We talked about a bunch of different ways to access the storage under the
						bed.  Eventually we settled on drawers, so that I wouldn&#39;t have to be
						digging under the platform for items.
					</p>
					<p>
						Box-joint for the drawers.

						There is some wasted space that could have been put to use if we had used
						shelving and sliding doors -- but I think it was worth the sacrifice.  This
						way I&#39;m not on my hands and knees every time I need something from storage.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					
					
					<p>
						&#34;Fuck it&#34; is a great reason.  But I obviously put more thought into
						something so drastic.  Impulse only goes so far.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are two primary motivating factors:
					</p>
					<h2>1. Mortgages are a complete rip-off</h2>
					<p>
						The average American household spends over a third of their take home pay
						on housing... For 30 years.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is utterly insane.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let&#39;s put that in perspective:
					</p>
					<p>
						If you work 40 hours, 9-5, then Monday and Tuesday are dedicated to paying
						for your house.  Every week.  If your housing was paid off, your weekend
						would be longer than your work week.
					</p>
					<p>
						You will spend 2,600 days at work to pay for your house.
					</p>
					<p>
						I built my van in under 40 days.  The money used to fund the build only
						took about a year to save up.
					</p>
					<p>
						I could purchase and build a new van every two years, and <em>still</em>
						pay less in housing!
					</p>
					<p>
						Do your own math.  Calculate your cost in terms of time spent at work.  For
						some reason, we give special exception to mortgages... we would never spend
						hundreds of thousands of dollars on anything else.  Why does housing get a
						pass?
					</p>
					<p>
						We should be building houses that can be paid off in 5 years <em>max</em> --
						not 30.  Instead of using our innovation to <a href="https://www.aei.org/publication/todays-new-homes-are-1000-square-feet-larger-than-in-1973-and-the-living-space-per-person-has-doubled-over-last-40-years/">build
						bigger houses</a>, we should use it to <a href="https://www.tumbleweedhouses.com/">build
						less expensive houses</a>.
					</p>
					<h2>2. Corporate life feels like a zoo</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html">You Weren&#39;t Meant to Have a
						Boss</a> (emphasis mine):
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that I&#39;d only
						seen in zoos before. It was remarkable how different they seemed.
						Particularly lions. Lions in the wild seem about ten times more alive.
						They&#39;re like different animals. I suspect that working for oneself feels
						better to humans in much the same way that living in the wild must feel
						better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion. <strong>Life in a zoo is
						easier, but it isn&#39;t the life they were designed for.</strong>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						My corporate job was easy.  It paid great.  The people I worked with were
						smart and talented.
					</p>
					<p>
						I should feel <em>lucky</em> to have such an awesome job in the middle of a
						recession... right?
					</p>
					<p>
						Yeah... but I didn&#39;t feel lucky.  I felt like I was in the human zoo.
						Predictable, boring, lazy... sitting behind a desk, while watching the
						outside world through the window of the Internet.  Trapped, because I needed
						my paycheck to pay my mortgage.
					</p>
					<p>
						Day by day, year by year.  All the comforts -- big screen TV, nice house,
						fast Internet, big bed, three bathrooms (for one person!).  No risk taking.
						Steady and safe.
					</p>
					<p>
						What&#39;s the point?
					</p>
					<p>
						Yeah, life isn&#39;t easy now.  Yeah, so what.  Who fucking cares?  At least
						when I get up in the morning, it&#39;s because I&#39;m exhilerated at tackling the
						next task.  At least I can see the world with my own damn eyes -- not
						through some <a href="https://www.theonion.com/article/report-90-of-waking-hours-spent-staring-at-glowing-2747">glowing
						rectangle</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Yeah, I don&#39;t have all those comforts.  But you know what I do have?
						Freedom.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sure, it&#39;s cliché, but it&#39;s cliché for a reason -- this
						subconscious drive for freedom is hard-wired in our DNA.  No modern
						comfort or toy can take the place of <em>true autonomy</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						And unless you win the lottery, you basically have two paths to freedom:
					</p>
					<p>
						1. Work your life away, acquire lots of money, and enjoy your freedom when
						you hit 67.
					</p>
					<p>
						or 2. Live frugally <em>today</em>.  Sell all your shit.  Say &#34;no&#34; to modern
						comforts.  And enjoy your freedom <em>now</em>, when you have the capacity
						to fully enjoy it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Is having a couch and TV worth being stuck in a cubicle for the rest of your
						life?  Is showering at the gym <em>so terrible</em> that you&#39;d rather spend
						your waking hours pretending to work so you can have your own bathroom?
					</p>
					<p>
						Let it go.

						Same process as before -- measure out an area, leave room for a toe kick,
						frame it out, and build a drawer:

					</p>
					<p>
						The only thing that goofed us up was trying to figure out which drawer
						glides to use... The drawer has to come out quite a bit, so the fridge can
						open.  We found some that were long enough, but they didn&#39;t fit without
						mounting them to the <em>bottom</em> of the drawer.  A little strange, but
						it works.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/sink4.jpg" width="750" height="505"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Instead of wiring the fridge directly to the power, I used a DC socket
						instead.

						fridge air out.

						It was getting late, but I realized I had all the pieces to finish the
						electrical system -- so I excitedly put it together :-).
					</p>
					<p>
						First, cut all the 0 AWG wire.  Why 0 AWG?  Because I had a 1500 watt
						inverter, which meant I could be pulling 150 amps (1500 watts output / 120
						volts output * 12 volts input = 150 amps input).
					</p>
					<p>
						By the way: 0 AWG wire is a pain in the ass to deal with.  We soldered the
						connectors on the end.  Yes, those are bolt cutters.
					</p>

						(Working into the night... &#34;This ain&#39;t no union job!&#34;)

						Here is a diagram of the inner workings:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/wiring8.jpg" width="750" height="478"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						It looks more complicated than it is... Basically, just hooking everything
						up, but with fuses on the positive wires.  20 amp fuse to protect the charge
						controller, 30 amp fuse to protect the batteries, 150 amp fuse to protect
						the inverter.  0 AWG wire between the batteries, and connecting the
						inverter; 12 AWG everywhere else.
					</p>
					<p>
						Not shown, but I also had to attach the power line from the driver side
						switch box directly to the batteries, along with the fan power line.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our reward?  Switching the LED light on and off :-).
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/electric4.jpg" width="750" height="691"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Checking the next morning -- yes, the solar does charge the battery :-).
						It&#39;s a 250 amp-hr system, with 200 watts of solar panels.

						I decided on using plastic buckles and straps to keep things secure while
						driving around.  It was pretty easy to cut the straps to the right length,
						burn the ends to prevent fraying, and screw them into the wood.
					</p>
					<p>
						My Dad worked on finishing off some of the other panels -- the panel in
						front of the inverter and the two panels under the closet.  He also attached
						the hardware (handles and knobs), and made the platform beneath the sink, to
						hold some extra water.
					</p>
					<p>
						With everything so close to being done, I started moving in.

						With all major work completed (except flooring), it seemed like a good time
						to get acclimated to van life.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first night was &#34;ok&#34;.  The air became stuffy, and I was hot, so I slept
						on top of the blankets.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout the week, I tweaked my routine, and now it is quite comfortable.
						I bought an extra fan to help circulate air, and I learned not to sleep
						<em>on</em> my blanket -- the mattress is designed to dissipate heat, and
						works quite well at keeping me cool; the blanket just aborbs the heat and
						makes things worse.
					</p>
					<p>
						One thing I noticed is that it would be nice to have a night stand... so we
						made a slot where a board can slide out from under the mattress:

						How will you go to the bathroom?
					</p>
					<p>
						Public facilities.  Grocery stores, book stores, Wal-Mart, etc.  For
						emergencies, I have a pee bottle and a 5 gallon jug.  Line the jug with
						two trash bags, and cover the poop with kitty litter.  Then toss it in a
						dumpster.  Hopefully I won&#39;t have to do that too often!
					</p>
					<p>
						What do your friends and family think?
					</p>
					<p>
						I keep good company -- my family and friends have been awesome.  No one has
						told me I&#39;m crazy (to my face :-P), and most have expressed excitement for
						me.
					</p>
					<p>
						How will you support yourself?
					</p>
					<p>
						I have some money saved up.  I also work part-time as a freelance
						programmer, which can be done anywhere.  <em>Hopefully</em> I will launch
						a successful indie game development business with all my extra time --
						afterall, that&#39;s the whole point!
					</p>
					<p>
						How long are you going to do this?
					</p>
					<p>
						Two years.  Of course, I reserve the right to quit early if I hate it...
						or go longer, if I love it :-P.  But the initial plan is two years.
					</p>
					<p>
						Who does this...!?
					</p>
					<p>
						Actually, a lot of people!  If you look around online, you can find tons of
						people who have done exactly the same thing.  This might seem like a bizarre
						idea at first -- but look around on YouTube and
						<a href="https://reddit.com/r/vandwellers">Reddit</a>, you&#39;ll see how common
						it really is.
					</p>
					<p>
						In fact, if you go to your local Wal-Mart in the early morning, chances are
						you&#39;ll see lots of vans and RVs in the parking lot, off to the side.  There
						are people in there, living their mobile life.
					</p>
					<p>
						So... you&#39;re living in your vehicle.  Are you okay?  Do you need money?
					</p>
					<p>
						Yes, I am okay.  No, I don&#39;t need money.  (In fact, I probably have more
						money than you... how much is your mortgage, by the way? :-P)
					</p>
					<p>
						Some people live in their vehicle because they are in a bad situation, lost
						their job, have some sort of drug or alcohol abuse, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						But many people are just regular folks, not in a desperate situation, and
						choose to live a mobile lifestyle.  Like I said: look around on YouTube.
						Search for &#34;van dwelling&#34; or &#34;full time rv&#34;.  You&#39;ll see what I mean.
					</p>
					<p>
						I certainly feel bad for those who are going through a hard time.  But I
						choose this lifestyle, at least for now, in order to free up my time and
						adventure on life :-).
					</p>
					<p>
						Where do you plan on going?
					</p>
					<p>
						I don&#39;t have a fixed schedule or route.  I do have some key destinations I
						would like to see.  My first target is the
						<a href="https://www.winchestermysteryhouse.com/">Winchester Mystery
						House</a> in San Jose, California.  That just gives me something to look
						forward to... I&#39;ll be taking my time and visiting lots of locations.
					</p>
					<p>
						What did X cost?  What model of X did you buy?  Where did you buy X?
					</p>
					<p>
						Good news, everyone!  I kept a detailed cost log, with links to specific
						items, that you can download here:
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/cost.pdf">Download Cost Spreadsheet</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Short answer: My total out of pocket cost: $23,205.  The van was $33,750,
						trading in my truck got me $16,000, and the build cost $5,555 (and a $100
						gift certificate).

					<ol>
						<li>The Fan-Tastic Fan leaked</li>
						<li>Solar was hit-and-miss</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Some people pointed out that silicone is great <em>for buildings</em>, but
						is notorious for causing leaks in RVs and vans.  Boy, were they right! :-)

					<p>
						The fan started dripping under heavy weather by the second week.

						The fix?  Butyl tape and Dicor caulk.

					<h2>Battery Isolater</h2>
					<p>
						The solar just wasn&#39;t cutting it.
					</p>
					<p>
						It worked great when there was sun -- but if I had two cloudy days in a row,
						my fridge would drain the battery.  This caused me to stress out over the
						weather and battery levels constantly.
					</p>
					<p>
						The solution: a magical device called a battery isolater.
					</p>
					<p>
						A battery isolater allows you to connect your auxiliary batteries to your
						starter battery.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you run your engine, your alternator normally charges your starter
						battery.  By connecting the auxiliary batteries to the starter battery, the
						alternator charges <em>both</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now of course, this isn&#39;t free: I am paying for gasoline.  But the battery
						charges so quickly, I really don&#39;t think this is putting a huge dent in my
						budget.  I never run the engine specifically to charge the auxiliary
						batteries -- just the few times I run it during the day to drive around and
						run errands is enough to keep me topped off.
					</p>
					<p>
						Installating the battery isolater was no problem.  Basically, hook the
						starter battery&#39;s positive (red) to the auxiliary battery&#39;s positive (red),
						with the battery isolater in between.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then, hook the auxiliary battery&#39;s negative (black) to the frame of the van.
						This seems strange at first, but that&#39;s how vehicles are wired -- it&#39;s
						called a negative ground.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/battery-isolater.jpg" width="750" height="337"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						This $60 gizmo is worth it&#39;s weight in gold.
					</p>
					<p>
						I haven&#39;t worried about my charge since.
					</p>
					<p>
						Honestly, in my opinion, the solar is just a waste of money.  There is
						something nice about having the free energy from the sun to charge your
						battery -- but gasoline is so much more practical.
					</p>
					<p>
						Solar sucks for three basic reasons:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Cost.  I paid $783 for my solar setup.  If I had skipped solar, I
							wouldn&#39;t have needed a roof rack.</li>
						<li>Stealth.  People <em>notice</em> my panels.  I have had a lot of people
							(including cops) remark to me about my panels.  No thanks.</li>
						<li>Weather.  Sure, solar works great when the sun is out.  Guess what: the
							sun isn&#39;t always out.  And you sure notice every cloudy moment when your
							entire energy budget is dependant on cloud coverage.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						A battery isolater solves all three problems:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Cost.  The battery isolater cost $60.</li>
						<li>Stealth.  The wire runs under the body of the van.  No one sees
							anything.</li>
						<li>Weather.  Who cares?  If I need energy, I buy gasoline -- which I do
							anyways.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						That being said, I do have a beastly 220 amp alternator.  Not sure how much
						that affects my numbers, but it&#39;s certainly a help.
					</p>

						Back on the road...

						Boy, I&#39;m really sorry guys.  Pictures just don&#39;t do it justice.

						That&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve noticed on my trip.  The pictures are so pale and flat

						urgency of getting to the next town, the fear and paranoia starts to kick
						in :-).

						When I set out on my trip in July, my target was the
						<a href="https://www.winchestermysteryhouse.com/">Winchester Mystery
						House</a> -- for no particular reason, other than to have a destination to
						aim for on the opposite coast.
					</p>
					<p>
						It&#39;s a destination that represents why living on the road is so great: I
						would never fly across country and stay in a hotel just to see the Mystery
						house, but my lifestyle enables me to see things I would never take the time
						to experience individually.
					</p>
					<p>
						Plus it just looked cool.
					</p>
					<p>
						So of course I did the full tour and enjoyed myself :-).  Unfortunately,
						the tour guides ban pictures inside the house.  They do allow you to take
						pictures of the outside, though:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/mystery1.jpg" width="750" height="563"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						The tour was a lot more interesting that I thought it would be.
					</p>
					<p>
						The woman who lived in the house had gobs of money from owning the
						Winchester Arms Company.  She was paranoid about the spirits of people
						killed with her weapons haunting her.  So she spent the last half of her
						life spending all her money building out her mansion.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/mystery2.jpg" width="750" height="558"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						She intentionally had the house built in bizarre and confusing ways, in
						order to confuse the spirits.  For example, one door on the second floor
						actually leads off the side of the house:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/mystery3.jpg" width="750" height="1023"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						The house is a maze, with stairs leading nowhere, doors to brick walls, and
						obsession with symbolism.
					</p>
					<p>
						The most interesting part for me was the actual enginnering of a Victorian
						mansion.  It was built before electricity was common, so it used gas
						throughout the house for light.  It had a boiler room in the basement to
						pump hot water through the house to keep it warm, and a primitive intercom
						system so the woman could call her servants from different rooms.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was really cool -- if you&#39;re in the San Jose area, it&#39;s worth a day
						trip.
					</p>
					<p>
						(That&#39;s it for the amazing pictures... :-P)
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					
					<p>
						It&#39;s awesome to see all these amazing places, but actually, most of my time
						is spent working.
					</p>
					<p>
						And in fact, that is my primary goal: to create compelling games and
						hopefully launch a profitable business.  The breathtaking views are just a
						nice side-effect :-).
					</p>
					<p>
						So: how has it gone, so far?
					</p>
					<p>
						My focus for the first 6 months was creating a programming language, which I
						call Kong.  I&#39;ve been working on the language for a few years now, but have
						never been able to get anywhere working nights and weekends.
					</p>
					<p>
						I&#39;m proud to say that I&#39;ve reached my target: in the 6 months, I have
						created a compiler, intermediate bytecode representation, virtual machine,
						and garbage collector.
					</p>
					<p>
						That means Kong is actually usable.  I have a test suite that I run
						everything against, and I&#39;m passing all my tests :-).
					</p>
					<p>
						Why create a programming language, if my target is to create games?
					</p>
					<p>
						Game programming is a behemoth of complexity.  Traditionally, you have two
						basic approaches to manage that complexity: 1. use someone else&#39;s toolset
						and jump right in to making games, or 2. build your own toolset.
					</p>
					<p>
						Using someone else&#39;s toolset is tempting... but I have been bitten too many
						times using other people&#39;s platforms.  In many ways, living in the van is
						similar: sometimes, it&#39;s just better to take responsibility, and build it
						yourself.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, just like my house, my work is also handmade.  Sure, that means it&#39;s not
						as fancy, but at the end of the day, it&#39;s <em>mine</em>.  No one else owns
						it.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is a certain pride in building something yourself.
					</p>
					<p>
						And now, I have officially moved on to building games.  My target is to
						create seven games over the course of 2016.  If all goes according to plan,
						the first game will be available in January of 2017 -- one year from now.
					</p>
					<p>
						I plan on keeping a development log on my website,
						<a href="https://sean.cm">sean.cm</a>.  I hope to post once a week.
					</p>

					<p>
						The last thing to address is what I think of this crazy lifestyle after
						six months.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let me start by saying that living in a stationary building is better.  If
						I could afford it, I would definitely prefer to have a condo.  I think I
						would be more productive, and have a higher quality of life.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>That being said</em>, living the van life is pretty fucking awesome.
					</p>
					<p>
						I mean, c&#39;mon, get real:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>I wake up whenever I want.</li>
						<li>I exercise every day.</li>
						<li>I see cool shit all the time.</li>
						<li>I take naps after lunch.</li>
						<li>I work on whatever I want.</li>
						<li>I don&#39;t have rent.</li>
						<li>I don&#39;t have a mortgage.</li>
						<li>I don&#39;t have a power bill.</li>
						<li>I don&#39;t have a lawn guy.</li>
						<li>I don&#39;t have to worry about my water heater breaking.</li>
						<li>I don&#39;t have to worry about my sewer line breaking.</li>
						<li>I don&#39;t have annoying neighbors.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Every morning I wake up happy as shit.  I have a huge smile on my face, and
						I&#39;m just beaming with excitement.
					</p>
					<p>
						That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s perfect; there are a lot of things that can be hard.
						But overall: I am significantly happier now than I was in my corporate job.
					</p>
					<p>
						It&#39;s important to understand <em>why</em>, though.
					</p>
					<p>
						The magic isn&#39;t in the van.  The magic is in the freedom.  The van simply
						enables me to experience that freedom.
					</p>
					<p>
						If I could have the same level of freedom in a stationary building, I would
						absolutely do that.  But given a choice between freedom in a van, and
						slavery in a house: I choose the van.
					</p>
					<p>
						The biggest downside of living on the road is the loneliness.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nothing sucks more than your friends inviting you over for poker night, but
						you&#39;re a thousand miles away, alone, in a parking lot.
					</p>
					<p>
						I think when I get back to the East coast, I will spend more time over
						there, closer to friends and family.  <em>Still in my van</em>, but close
						enough to hang out.
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						If I could describe living in a van with one word, it would be: easy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Man, my life is so easy now.
					</p>
					<p>
						Life <em>is</em> easy.  Humans are fucking badass -- we absolutely dominate
						our environment and are so smart and powerful.  But for some strange reason,
						we take those millions years of evolution encoded in our DNA and throw it
						out the door.  We live in ways that are so counter to the flow of nature.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let&#39;s take one simple example: why the <em>fuck</em> are humans mowing
						lawns.  That is simply beyond stupid.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are intentionally spending our money/time <em>fighting</em> nature, in
						a battle we are smart enough to recognize <em>we can&#39;t win</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						No other animal wages war against nature.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here&#39;s another one:
					</p>
					<p>
						We work ourselves so hard (usually accomplishing nothing), that we don&#39;t
						have time to cook or exercise.  So we eat garbage and trade our health for
						money.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then, when we get sick, we trade that money for healthcare.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is insanity.
					</p>
					<p>
						How about: people buy storage units.
					</p>
					<p>
						How are storage units <em>even a thing</em>!?
					</p>
					<p>
						What the hell is wrong with us?
					</p>
					<p>
						We pay slave labor to build crappy products we don&#39;t use, then we pay for a
						place to put those useless crappy products, and watch over them.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please, go lookup the history of diamond rings.  We literally pay thousands
						of dollars for shiny rocks.  Mind boggling.
					</p>
					<p>
						...
					</p>
					<p>
						So yeah: my life is easy, man :-).
					</p>
					<p>
						My life is so easy.
					</p>
					<p>
						The only thing I want can&#39;t be purchased.  Self-actualization isn&#39;t for
						sale.  I&#39;m the richest man in the world.

						It is with the heaviest lightest heart, the bitterest sweetest taste, I am

					</p>
					<p>
						I&#39;ve been off the road for 2.5 years, and while I&#39;ve used my van for
						driving to the gym or store, I haven&#39;t been putting it to good use.
					</p>
					<p>
						It&#39;s time to let someone else journey on life.

						What a great van, and what a great adventure!
					</p>
					<p>
						To be honest, this whole thing was fucking crazy :-).
					</p>
					<p>
						Who in their right mind would quit a good paying job, throw away all of
						their stuff, and live out of parking lots for 2.5 years.  What in god&#39;s name
						was I thinking :-).
					</p>
					<p>
						You know, it&#39;s one thing to <em>dream</em> about casting away society and
						living as a vagabond.  It&#39;s another thing entirely to <em>do</em> it.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, cheers!
					</p>
					<p>
						Cheers to being young and crazy!
					</p>
					<p>
						Cheers to trying something new and scary!
					</p>
					<p>
						Cheers to freedom for being insatiable!
					</p>
					<p>
						And cheers to a damn <em>cargo van</em> for making it all possible!

						Sure, it&#39;s easy for me to celebrate now -- I&#39;ve got a great job again, and a
						normal life of spending time with my girlfriend, looking forward to the
						weekend, paying bills, and having a toilet.
					</p>
					<p>
						I remember being terrified at the time.
					</p>
					<p>
						I&#39;m not sure if it really comes across in this document.  Perhaps I was
						trying to put on a strong face.  Or perhaps I was just trying to convince
						myself that <em>surely</em> I&#39;m not throwing my life away... right?
					</p>
					<p>
						I remember when I bought the van.  That was the moment it became real to me.
					</p>
					<p>
						This picture in particular makes me laugh:
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/peter-salter/my-promaster.jpg" width="375" height="500"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						All smiles for the camera, sure!  Inside was another story!
					</p>
					<p>
						Here&#39;s what I had to say about the <a href="#first-night">first night in the
						van</a>:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							The first night was &#34;ok&#34;. The air became stuffy, and I was hot, so I
							slept on top of the blankets.
						</p>
						<p>
							Throughout the week, I tweaked my routine, and now it is quite
							comfortable.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						LOL!
					</p>
					<p>
						Yeah, &#34;ok&#34;!
					</p>
					<p>
						More like &#34;oh god, this was terrible, but now I&#39;ve sunken all this time and
						energy into this project, what the hell am I going to do?!?!&#34;
					</p>
					<p>
						Adapt.  That&#39;s what I did.  And it did work out.  But that first night was
						rough, let me tell you.
					</p>
					<p>
						And my first trip away from the house?  I didn&#39;t write about it here!
					</p>
					<p>
						I was <em>terrified!</em>  All damn day!
					</p>
					<p>
						I parked near a Jo-ann Fabrics, and created my curtains in the parking lot,
						hammering grommets into the fabric on the cement outside my van, convinced
						someone was going to come by and yell at me.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was awkward, scared, fragile, and ready to burst into tears.
					</p>
					<p>
						I did journal about it though -- here&#39;s what I wrote at the time:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Wow, I was just in a really depressed/anxious mood, and suddenly, typing
							on this computer has made me feel immensely better.
						</p>
						<p>
							I was going to write about how lonely I feel... how I miss having a
							home... how I don&#39;t like hanging out in parking lots...
						</p>
						<p>
							But... something about this computer. It feels home. I feel better. I am
							not just hanging out in a parking lot... I am sitting in my bed, typing
							on my computer. I may just program like this. It&#39;s actually quite easy
							to type.
						</p>
						<p>
							Maybe I can do this after all.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						<em>Maybe I can do this after all.</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						You did do it, and I&#39;m proud of you, 32 year old Sean.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					
					<p>
						So you want to go on an adventure.
					</p>
					<p>
						First, the good news:
					</p>
					<p>
						You are an unstoppable force of nature.
					</p>
					<p>
						You are adaptable.  You are strong.  You are a goddamn lion.
					</p>
					<p>
						Actually, scratch that.
					</p>
					<p>
						You&#39;re better than a lion: You&#39;re a goddamn <em>human being</em>.  The
						smartest, most clever animal on this planet.
					</p>
					<p>
						You went to the fucking moon.
					</p>
					<p>
						And you can conquer this too.
					</p>
					<h2 id="be-smart">1. Be Smart</h2>
					<p>
						Most places are safe.  But not all.
					</p>
					<p>
						I stayed at 45 different Walmarts over the course of my trip.  Three of them
						I consider unsafe and would never return.
					</p>
					<p>
						The world can throw weird shit at you.  One time I was parked in shopping
						center in the middle of the day, and I noticed a van circling the parking
						lot.  They parked next to my van, and the driver got out and started looking
						in my windows.
					</p>
					<p>
						What would you do?
					</p>
					<p>
						The moment he started physically touching my van, I decided I had to
						confront him.  He played it off like he was just being curious, but it was
						obvious to me, he and his friend were looking to jack some tools.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some things I learned that day:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Always park in such a way that you can pull forward or reverse.  I
							parked against a divider, so when the thief was behind my van, I
							couldn&#39;t pull out -- he was blocking my only exit.</li>
						<li>Get some realistic self defense products.  I had knives.  I should have
							had pepper spray instead.</li>
						<li>Get an alarm and use it.  I had a propane alarm that I <em>could</em>
							have pressed the &#34;Test&#34; button to make a loud noise.  I realized that
							afterwards.</li>
						<li>The night is more dangerous, but keep your guard up in the day too.
							This happened in broad daylight in the afternoon.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="leave">2. Leave</h2>
					<p>
						Your biggest advantage is you aren&#39;t tied to any single location.
					</p>
					<p>
						Use it!
					</p>
					<p>
						Trust your instinct, and if something doesn&#39;t feel right, don&#39;t waste time
						analyzing the situation.  You don&#39;t have to explain yourself to anyone.
						Leave!
					</p>
					<p>
						But it doesn&#39;t just have to be safety -- many times I would park somewhere,
						only to have someone noisy park right next to me.
					</p>
					<p>
						Instead of being annoyed for the next hour, just get up and go.  Park in the
						next lot over.  It takes two minutes, and you can return to peace.
					</p>
					<p>
						I once had someone follow me into a parking lot to road rage at me.  Maybe
						I cut him off?  I don&#39;t even know.  Screw it -- just leave.  You don&#39;t owe
						anyone anything.
					</p>
					<h2 id="plan-ahead">3. Plan Ahead</h2>
					<p>
						Okay, so you&#39;ve been driving all day, and you pulled into your final
						destination at 10pm.  You&#39;re tired, and ready to sleep.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then the security guard tells you to leave.
					</p>
					<p>
						Great.  Now you have to hunt for a new location at night, and you&#39;re
						exhausted.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some simple planning could have avoided this:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Naps are great!  You have a freaking bed in your vehicle.  Pull over
							during the day and take a nap!  This allows you to stay awake longer at
							night, which is great for learning a new environment, and gives you the
							opportunity to leave without being exhausted.</li>
						<li>Have backup locations.  Walmarts are everywhere -- go to a location
							where you&#39;ll have a few to choose from.  If the first one doesn&#39;t work
							out, try the next one.</li>
						<li>Travel less.  You don&#39;t have to move to a new city every other day.
							Once you find a good safe spot, hang out there a month, and take your
							time planning your next move.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="meet-people">4. Meet People</h2>
					<p>
						Loneliness can be a huge issue, so take the time to meet people.  That could
						mean dating, or it could mean doing MeetUps.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some people will think you&#39;re crazy, and be scared of the weirdo in the van.
						Respect their space and move on.
					</p>
					<p>
						But <em>other</em> people will understand immediately.  If you feel safe,
						then open up and show off!
					</p>
					<p>
						Living in a van is such a great <em>filter</em>.  Don&#39;t hide from it, or
						feel ashamed.  Filter out the people who think you&#39;re crazy, and filter
						<em>in</em> the people who think you&#39;re awesome.
					</p>
					<p>
						I dated while I was on the road, and met my girlfriend because she thought
						the van was the coolest thing ever.  I put it as my first image in my
						profile, and always told people before meeting them.
					</p>
					<p>
						Respect people and their boundaries.  Some people won&#39;t get it.  They might
						say something mean.  So what?  Let them go, and don&#39;t take it personally.
					</p>
					<p>
						Connect with the people who have the same sense of adventure.
					</p>
					<h2 id="have-fun">5. Have Fun</h2>
					<p>
						Maybe you have an idea for a side hustle.  Or maybe you&#39;re working part time
						out of the van.  Or maybe you&#39;re doing seasonal work.
					</p>
					<p>
						Don&#39;t get so lost in your work that you don&#39;t take the time to experience
						the amazing places around the country.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of my regrets is I worked <em>too much</em>.  I wish I would have gone
						to Yellowstone park.  I wish I would have spent more time in Utah.  I wish
						I had hiked down into the Grand Canyon.  Or drove through Arizona.
					</p>
					<p>
						Take your time, and enjoy your freedom.
					</p>
					<p>
						One trick for visiting cities is to park the van at a Walmart outside the
						city, and take an Uber into the city.  Then you can explore the city all
						day, and Uber back out.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another trick is to get a hotel room.  When I visited Las Vegas, I parked my
						van at the airport, and took a taxi to a hotel.  It was expensive, but it
						was a nice break too.
					</p>
					<p>
						A lot of America looks the same.  Shopping centers, gas stations, big-box
						stores.
					</p>
					<p>
						Seek out the unique locations, and have fun.
					</p>
				</section>

					<p>
						And with that, my adventure into vandwelling is over.  This is my final
						report.
					</p>
					<p>
						Thank you for reading and following along.  I met a lot of you, and you
						would tell me how you loved my website, and read every part.  Thank you.
					</p>
					<p>
						I feel incredibly lucky to have had the time and resources to try this crazy
						experiment.  I will never forget it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Maybe vandwelling isn&#39;t for you, but something is.  And whatever it is, I
						hope you take that risk, and adventure on life.  Maybe we can&#39;t escape the
						cubicle entirely, but we don&#39;t have to be a slave to it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Take that sabbatical.  Chase that crazy dream.  The cubicle will still be
						there when you return from your vision quest.
					</p>
					<p>
						But you will be a changed person, and it will be worth it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Happy adventuring!
					</p>
