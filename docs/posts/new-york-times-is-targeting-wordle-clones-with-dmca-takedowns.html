    <h1>New York Times is targeting Wordle clones with DMCA takedowns</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hundreds of games inspired by <em>Wordle</em>, the popular web-based word puzzle, are at risk of being deleted due to copyright takedowns issued by <em>The New York Times</em>. <a href="https://www.404media.co/nytimes-files-copyright-takedowns-against-hundreds-of-wordle-clones/">As reported by<em> 404 Media</em></a>, <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> — which purchased <em>Wordle</em> back in 2022 — has filed several DMCA notices over <em>Wordle</em> clones created by GitHub coders, citing its ownership over the <em>Wordle</em> name and copyrighted gameplay including 5x6 tile layout and gray, yellow, and green color scheme.</p><p>Two takedown requests were issued in January against <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/fdeb00c4425e23c3a8115c297bc54d44151c4289/2024/01/2024-01-24-nytimes-2.md?ref=404media.co">unofficial Korean</a> and <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/fdeb00c4425e23c3a8115c297bc54d44151c4289/2024/01/2024-01-24-nytimes.md?ref=404media.co">Bosnian-language</a> versions of the game. Additional requests were filed this week against <a href="https://www.shetnews.co.uk/2024/03/07/shetland-dialect-version-wordle-taken/"><em>Wirdle</em></a> — a variant created by dialect group I Hear Dee in 2022 to promote the Shaetlan language — and <em>Reactle</em>, an open-source <em>Wordle</em> clone built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. It was developed prior to the <em>Times’</em> purchase of the game, according to its developer, Chase Wackerfuss.</p><p>The <em>Reactle</em> code has been copied around 1,900 times, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240306172335/https://github.com/cwackerfuss/reactle">according to GitHub</a>, allowing developers to build upon it to create a wide variety of <em>Wordle</em>-inspired games that use different languages, themes, and visual styles, some of which <em>404 Media</em> says are “substantially different” from <em>Wordle</em>. The DMCA notice against <em>Reactle</em> also targets all of these games forked from the original <em>Reactle</em> code on GitHub, alleging that spinoffs containing the <em>Wordle</em> name have been made in “bad faith” and that “gameplay is copied exactly” in the <em>Reactle</em> repository. Numerous developers commenting on a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39618193">Hacker News thread</a> also claim to have been targeted with DMCA takedowns.</p><p><em>Reactle</em> coder Wackerfuss has removed the game, telling <em>404 Media</em> he doesn’t want to get into a legal battle with the<em> Times</em>.</p><p>In a statement to <em>404 Media</em>, the <em>Times</em> said: </p><div><blockquote><p>The Times has no issue with individuals creating similar word games that do not infringe The Times’s “Wordle” trademarks or copyrighted gameplay. The Times took action against a GitHub user and others who shared his code to defend its intellectual property rights in Wordle. The user created a “Wordle clone” project that instructed others how to create a knock-off version of The Times’s Wordle game featuring many of the same copyrighted elements. As a result, hundreds of websites began popping up with knock-off “Wordle” games that used The Times’s “Wordle” trademark and copyrighted gameplay without authorization or permission.</p></blockquote></div><p>Amusingly, <em>Wordle</em> has itself <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/24/wordle-kind-of-rips-off-lingo-a-copyright-lawyer-says-thats-ok.html">been criticized over striking similarities</a> it shares with <em>Lingo</em>, a 1980s game show that centered on players guessing five-letter words, with a grid that changes color based on accuracy. </p></div></div></div>
