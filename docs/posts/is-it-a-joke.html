    <h1>Is it a joke?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I listen to a lot of podcasts, because I can listen while making art
for <a href="https://highmountainabbey.com">the diorama-based game</a> I am
working on. I discovered the podcast
<a href="https://www.imaginaryadvice.com/">Imaginary Advice</a> because
MetaFilter linked to
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/ross-sutherland/109-a-christmas-carol-snes-1993">its episode on the SNES game A Christmas Carol</a>.
That’s a game that doesn’t exist – Ross Sutherland just made it up,
and then recorded a whole podcast episode about it. The episode
doesn’t acknowledge, at any point, that the game is fake. It’s
hilarious.</p>
<p>Sometimes I can’t tell whether something is a joke or not. I couldn’t
tell whether Semantle was a joke until I started getting fan mail.
And speaking of podcasts, apparently I’m not the only one with this
problem. I just heard on
<a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/hl-06-segagaga/">99% Invisible</a>
that when Tez Okano pitched Sega on Segagaga, one of the last
Dreamcast games, the execs thought his entire pitch was a joke, so he
had to pitch it again.</p>
<p>I’m not as good a writer as Ross Sutherland.  That’s why a lot of
people didn’t see the humor in <a href="https://novalis.org/blog/2025-10-27-blue-prince-1989.html">my post about the (fictional) 1989
Blue Prince</a>,
and thought I meant to actually fool people.  Fooling people was
really an accident – I just put in a little bit too much work on the
visuals. Actually, I meant the commentary as a serious critique: Blue
Prince has a very high busywork-to-puzzle ratio, and this is its
weakest point (also see
<a href="https://novalis.org/blog/2018-02-26-variance-and-dynamic-range-in-lost-cities-and-keltis.html">my previous note on gambling</a>;
Blue Prince literally has slot machines, and it’s sometimes optimal to
use them). But there is a lot of puzzle there too – several people
assumed that the floppy disk flipping bit referred to one specific
room in the actual Blue Prince. Nope. I hadn’t gotten to that area at
the time I wrote the post, and I still haven’t solved that
puzzle. Instead, I was inspired by learning about Karateka’s
upside-down disk Easter egg on
<a href="https://lateralcast.com/episodes/148/">Lateral</a>. Yep, another
podcast.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I’m wasting my time listening to all these
podcasts, but I was heartened to see that Adrian Tchaikovsky mentioned
that his Philosopher Tyrants series was inspired by
<a href="http://empirepoduk.com/">Empire</a> and
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/Revolutions">Revolutions</a>. It’s among
Tchaikovsky’s best work, and I can’t wait for the next one.  And
nobody can accuse Tchaikovsky of unproductivity. To bring it
full-circle, science fiction also inspires podcasts; after ten seasons
on actual historical revolutions, and after a two-year hiatus, the
Revolutions podcast returned with a season on the Martian Revolution
of 2247, presented totally straight-faced.</p>
<p>Two more notes that didn’t fit anywhere else:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I actually used
<a href="https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term">cool-retro-term</a>, not
RetroArch, which is why the font isn’t quite right. I thought about
using RetroArch but it looked like it was good to be a hassle to get
an Apple II running, plus then I would have had to maybe write
Applesoft BASIC.  Anyway, I decided to settle for good enough.  So
that’s why the font isn’t quite historically accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>I really enjoyed reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45824252">Egypt Urnash’s IF-style Blue Prince
scene</a>. I did consider
whether an IF Blue Prince would be better, but I think seeing the map
is really useful, and while you could incorporate a map into an IF
game (as <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=aearuuxv83plclpl">Counterfeit Monkey</a>
does), it sort of strains the medium a bit.</p></li>
