    <h1>AWS raises GPU prices 15% on a Saturday, hopes you weren&#39;t paying attention</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>I&#39;ve been tracking <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/" rel="nofollow">AWS</a> for a long time, with a specific emphasis on pricing. &#34;What happens if AWS hikes prices&#34; has always been something of a boogeyman, trotted out as a hypothetical to urge folks to avoid taking dependencies on a given provider.</p>
<p>Over the weekend - on a Saturday, no less - that hypothetical became real.</p>
<p>AWS has <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/capacityblocks/pricing/" rel="nofollow">quietly raised prices</a> on its EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML by approximately 15 percent. The p5e.48xlarge instance – eight NVIDIA H200 accelerators in a trenchcoat – jumped from $34.61 to $39.80 per hour across most regions, while the p5en.48xlarge climbed from $36.18 to $41.61. Customers in US West (N. California) face steeper hikes, with p5e rates rising from $43.26 to $49.75. The change had been telegraphed: AWS&#39;s pricing page noted (and bizarrely, still does) that &#34;current prices are scheduled to be updated in January, 2026,&#34; though the company neglected to mention which direction.</p>

    

<p>This comes about seven months after AWS trumpeted &#34;up to 45% price reductions&#34; for GPU instances - though that announcement covered On-Demand and Savings Plans rather than Capacity Blocks. Funny how that works.</p>

        


        

<p>For the uninitiated, Capacity Blocks are AWS&#39;s answer to &#34;I need guaranteed GPU capacity for my ML training job next Tuesday.&#34; You reserve specific GPU instances for a defined time window – anywhere from a day to a few weeks out – and pay up front at a locked-in rate. It&#39;s popular with companies doing serious ML work who can&#39;t afford to have a training run interrupted because spot capacity evaporated. The pricing should make it abundantly clear that the people using this aren&#39;t hobbyists; these are teams with budgets measured in millions.</p>
<p>An Amazon spox told us via email, &#34;EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML pricing vary based on supply and demand patterns, as described on the product detail page. This price adjustment reflects the supply/demand patterns we expect this quarter.&#34;</p>

        

<p>To be clear, AWS has raised prices before, but rarely as a straight increase to a line item. The company prefers to change pricing dimensions entirely, often <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-updated-pay-per-use-pricing-model-for-aws-config-rules/" rel="nofollow">spinning this as a price reduction for most customers</a> – a claim I&#39;d characterize as &#34;creative.&#34; Historical straight-up price increases have been tied to regulatory actions: per-SMS charges in certain markets and the like. This is different.</p>
<p>The timing is curious for another reason: it hands Azure and GCP a talking point on a silver platter. Both have been aggressively courting ML workloads, and &#34;AWS just raised GPU prices 15%&#34; is exactly the kind of ammunition enterprise sales teams dream about. Whether the competitors can actually absorb the demand is another question – GPU constraints are hardly unique to AWS – but perception matters in enterprise deals.</p>
<p>For companies with Enterprise Discount Programs or other negotiated agreements, this raises uncomfortable questions. EDPs typically guarantee discounts off public pricing – so if public pricing goes up 15 percent, your &#34;discounted&#34; rate just got more expensive in absolute terms, even if the percentage held steady. I expect some pointed conversations between AWS account teams and their larger customers in the coming weeks.</p>
<h3>Why are they doing this?</h3>
<p>It&#39;s hard not to see this as a bellwether. GPUs are increasingly constrained globally as the world pivots to generating slop-as-a-service in every conceivable domain. The question is what this means for other resource types down the road. Does the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/smartphones_memory_ai/">global RAM crunch</a> mean RAM-centric services are next? You can ignore ML Capacity Block pricing if you&#39;re not running machine learning workloads – which describes north of 95 percent of most companies&#39; cloud spend – but RAM touches every service AWS offers. Well, possibly excepting their support function, though that&#39;s <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-and-enhanced-aws-support-plans-add-ai-capabilities-to-expert-guidance/" rel="nofollow">rapidly becoming &#34;AI-Powered&#34;</a> too, so give it time.</p>

</ul>
<p>The canary-in-the-coal-mine concern here isn&#39;t GPUs specifically, but rather the precedent it establishes. AWS has spent two decades conditioning customers to expect prices only ever go down. That expectation is now broken. Once you&#39;ve raised prices on one service and the world doesn&#39;t end, the second increase becomes easier. And the third. The playbook has changed.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on services where AWS faces genuine supply constraints or where their costs have materially increased. Graviton instances have been priced aggressively to drive adoption – what happens when ARM chip supply tightens? Data transfer costs have been a cash cow for years, but they&#39;ve also been stable; are those next? I don&#39;t have inside information, but I do have pattern recognition, and the pattern just shifted.</p>

        

<p>AWS has long benefited from the assumption that cloud pricing only trends in one direction. That assumption died on a Saturday in January, with all the fanfare of a Terms of Service update. The question isn&#39;t whether this matters – it does. The question is whether it&#39;s an anomaly or the new normal. My money&#39;s on the latter. ®</p>
