    <h1>Adding row polymorphism to Damas-Hindley-Milner</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2 id="intro-to-hm">Intro to HM</h2>

<p>Damas-Hindley-Milner (HM) is a type system for Standard ML and the ML-family
languages. River and I <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/type-inference">wrote about it</a> earlier this
month. Check out that post if you would like an introduction or refresher. In
this post, we’ll add <em>row polymorphism</em> to it. We’ll do it in the context of
Algorithm J, but the core ideas should be algorithm-independent.</p>

<h2 id="records">Records</h2>

<p>A record is an unordered collection of <em>name</em> to <em>value</em> mappings, like <code>{ x =
1, y = &#34;hello&#34; }</code>. Scrapscript has a very dynamic notion of records in the
interpreter and the compiler: any record can have any number of fields, with
any names, with any values. This makes code like the following possible:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>get_x { x=1, y=2 }
. get_x =
  | { x=x, ... } -&gt; x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At run-time, the pattern matching looks for a field named <code>x</code> in the record and
ignores the rest. The spread (<code>...</code>) indicates that it’s okay to also have
other fields in the record. If the pattern were instead <code>{ x=x }</code>, then the
match would fail at run-time due to excess fields.</p>

<p>The following snippet also runs even though <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> have different
leftover record parts:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>get_x left + get_x right
. left  = { x = 1, y = 2 }
. right = { x = 1, y = 2, z = 3 }
. get_x = | { x = x, ... } -&gt; x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This “leftover” bit isn’t straightforward to model in the type system. We’ll
need some special sauce there.</p>

<p>Right now, in the type system, we don’t support records at all. If we try to
infer the type of one, it’ll fail with “unsupported” or something. We need to
model records in the type system.</p>

<h2 id="rows">Rows</h2>

<p>A lot of papers use a notion of <em>rows</em> to model records, kind of how you can
use cons cells to model lists. A <em>row</em> is a mapping of names to types, like
<code>{x=int, y=string}</code>. Rows also have a special field called <em>rest</em> which
contains the type of the leftover fields. It’s either a type variable or the
<em>empty row</em>.</p>

<p>Having the empty row means that the record has no leftover fields. In fact, the
example row above (<code>{x=int, y=string}</code>) is assumed to have the empty row as its
<em>rest</em> field because all of these papers love shorthand. If it were extensible,
if it had a type variable as its <em>rest</em> field, then it would be written as
<code>{x=int, y=string, ...&#39;a}</code>.</p>

<p>This does mean that it’s possible to have nested rows like <code>{x=int,
...&#39;a={y=string, ...&#39;b}}</code>. This is normal but you’ll never see it in notation
because everybody <strong>implicitly flattens the rows</strong> because it looks nicer. Also
because unification happens on the flattened rows, but we’ll get there later.
Now let’s talk about the data structures we’ll use to implement rows. We’ll
reuse some of the data structures from the intro-to-HM post.</p>

<h2 id="the-data-structures">The data structures</h2>

<p>It’s as I said: a row is either an empty row (<code>TyEmptyRow</code>) or has fields and a
leftover/rest field (<code>TyRow</code>).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@</span><span>dataclasses</span><span>.</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>(</span><span>MonoType</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclasses</span><span>.</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>TyRow</span><span>(</span><span>MonoType</span><span>):</span>
    <span>fields</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>]</span>
    <span>rest</span><span>:</span> <span>TyVar</span> <span>|</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span> <span>=</span> <span>dataclasses</span><span>.</span><span>field</span><span>(</span><span>default_factory</span><span>=</span><span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to unify and print rows, we’ll often deal with them in their flattened
representation, which is a collapsed tuple of fields and a rest type. One key
difference: because it is collapsed, the <em>rest</em> must be either the empty row or
an <strong>unbound</strong> type variable.</p>

<p>Also: not everybody uses the exact same representation. Some go for more
cons-cell-like representations where every row has a <code>label</code> and a <code>type</code> and
then a <code>rest</code>—no <code>fields</code> dict. They’re equivalent.</p>

<h2 id="inferring-record-literals">Inferring record literals</h2>

<p>When we’re inferring the type of a record literal, we infer the types of the
values and then construct a row from them. We should never see a <code>...</code> in a
record literal because we only support it in pattern matching.</p>

    <span># ...
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="pattern-matching-on-records">Pattern matching on records</h2>

<p>Pattern matching inference changed a little bit since the last post but not
enough to make a big deal out of it. We now use this kind-of-similar
<code>infer_pattern_type</code> function to infer the type of a pattern. It looks similar
to <code>infer_type</code> but it’s a little more complicated because it has to invent
fresh type variables for all variables in the pattern and it also has to deal
with spread.</p>

<p>In the case of records, we default to building a closed row. However, if we see
a spread, we invent a fresh type variable and use that as the <em>rest</em> of the
row.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>infer_pattern_type</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>:</span> <span>Object</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>:</span> <span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>:</span>

                <span># Open row
</span>                <span>rest</span> <span>=</span> <span>fresh_tyvar</span><span>()</span>
                <span>if</span> <span>value</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
                    <span>ctx</span><span>[</span><span>value</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Forall</span><span>([],</span> <span>rest</span><span>)</span>
                <span>break</span>
            <span>fields</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>infer_pattern_type</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>)</span>

    <span># ...
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also bind the <em>rest</em> variable to the name of the spread, if it’s named. This
means we can do stuff like <code>| { x=x, ...rest } -&gt; something</code> and then use
<code>rest</code> in the <code>something</code> expression.</p>

<h2 id="unifying-rows-building-intuition">Unifying rows: building intuition</h2>

<p>I don’t want to get too into it yet, but I want to explain that rows aren’t
special in unification. I thought that there was some quirk or trick in the
representation that enabled row polymorphism, but that’s not the case <em>at all</em>
(shout-out to <a href="https://osa1.net/">Sinan</a> and <a href="https://k-monk.org/">River</a> for making this clear).</p>

<p>Unification is just unification. Whatever types it gets, it <em>will</em> make them
equal. Permanently. If it can’t, there’s a type error. Let’s look at some
examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>{x=int}</code> unifies with <code>{x=int}</code></li>
  <li><code>{x=int}</code> <strong>does not</strong> unify with <code>{x=string}</code> because the types that
correspond with <code>x</code> don’t unify
    <ul>
      <li>Some type systems allow this by having a notion of “type sets” and I think
this might be related to polymorphic variants but I’m not sure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>{x=int}</code> <strong>does not</strong> unify with <code>{y=string}</code> because the fields don’t match
and they are not extensible</li>
  <li><code>{x=int, ...&#39;a}</code> unifies with <code>{y=string, ...&#39;b}</code>
    <ul>
      <li>unification will set <code>&#39;a</code> equal to <code>{y=string, ...&#39;c}</code> and <code>&#39;b</code> equal to <code>{x=int, ...&#39;c}</code></li>
      <li>note how they both get the same leftover row <code>&#39;c</code> because they are
<em>unified</em> and supposed to <em>stay that way</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so that means that if you have a function that is meant to be generic
over a single field, how does that work? How can you have <code>| {x=x, ...} -&gt; x</code>
if for every call to that function, the type of <code>...</code> keeps expanding as it is
unified? It might start as <code>{x=int, ...&#39;a} -&gt; int</code> but over time <code>&#39;a</code> will get bound
to other row types and it might end up as <code>{x=int, y=int, z=int, ...&#39;d}</code> and
that will be too restrictive! <em>What’s going on??</em></p>

<h2 id="let-polymorphism">Let polymorphism</h2>

<p>What’s actually happening is boring: let polymorphism strikes once again. We
talked about let polymorphism in the last post, but here’s a refresher: if you
have an unbound type variable in a let-bound function type, it will get
generalized with a <code>forall</code>.</p>

<p>Have a function <code>&#39;a list -&gt; &#39;a</code>? Well, the type in the context (the environment
that deals in type variables) is actually <code>forall &#39;a. &#39;a list -&gt; &#39;a</code>. Every use
of that named function will <em>instantiate</em> that <code>forall</code> with a fresh type
variable (maybe <code>&#39;b</code> or <code>&#39;t123</code> or whatever). This means that the same function
can be generic over one or more type variables. Great.</p>

<p>So that pattern match function above? The one with type <code>{x=int, ...&#39;a} -&gt;
int</code>? Well, if it’s bound to a name, it will get generalized to <code>forall &#39;a.
{x=int, ...&#39;a} -&gt; int</code>. So every call, well… you know the rest. That’s row
polymorphism.</p>

<h2 id="unifying-rows-brass-tacks">Unifying rows: brass tacks</h2>

<p>Alright, well, assuming we have what I thought was the hard part done already,
let’s go over unification in excruciating detail. We’ll start with a neat
little base case: empty rows can only unify with other empty rows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>unify_type</span><span>(</span><span>ty1</span><span>:</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>,</span> <span>ty2</span><span>:</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span># ...
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>ty1</span><span>,</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>)</span> <span>and</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>ty2</span><span>,</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span>
    <span># ...
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Yay, nice. Let’s continue. We’ll start by flattening the rows.</p>

<p>For every field name present in either row, we’ll try to unify the types
pairwise. But if it’s missing in one of the rows, we have to add it to the
other one. So we collect that in <code>ty1_missing</code> (missing from <code>ty1</code>) and
<code>ty2_missing</code> (missing from <code>ty2</code>).</p>

<p>This leaves us with four cases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Both rows have all the same fields. In that case, we unify the <em>rest</em>s so
they stay the same.</li>
  <li>One row has all the same fields as the other and also some more. In that
case, add the missing fields to the other (smaller) row. Note that they
share a <em>rest</em>.</li>
  <li>The same, but flipped the other direction.</li>
  <li>They each have fields the other lacks. In that case, create new rows with
the missing fields and share a <em>rest</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now follow along in code:</p>

<p>There’s a lot of code but the important thing to know is that both rows are
going to end up with the same fields and the same rest type.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>There you have it. That constitutes row polymorphism. There’s some other stuff
we don’t need to get into because Scrapscript doesn’t have some language
features. For example, Daan Leijen of scoped labels fame <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41857230">jumped into the
Hacker News thread</a> to explain
why we might not need scoped/shadowed/duplicate labels:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About duplicate labels.. one needs to retain the duplicate field at runtime
<em>if</em> there is a “remove_l” or “mask_l” operation that drops a field “l”. For
example, <code>{x=2,x=True}.remove_x.x</code> == <code>True</code>. (Where the type of <code>remove_l</code>
is <code>{l:a|r} -&gt; {r}</code>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since we don’t have such a masking operation, our lives are easier. Cool.</p>

<p>We’ve heard that we can use rows to implement polymorphic variants, but haven’t
figured that part out yet…</p>

<!--
## Variants

Scrapscript supports variants or tags similar to OCaml's notion of [polymorphic
variants](https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/polyvariant.html). We don't have any
encoding in the type system for these right now.

We're currently reading:

* [Programming with Polymorphic Variants](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/papers/garrigue-polymorphic_variants-ml98.pdf) (PDF, 1998)
* [Restrictable Variants: A Simple and Practical Alternative to Extensible Variants](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol263-ecoop2023/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2023.17/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2023.17.pdf) (PDF, 2003)

Please recommend additional papers, blog posts, and implementations.
