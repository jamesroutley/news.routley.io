<h4>What I Did</h4>



<ul>
<li>CS50 Web:
<ul>
<li>Worked on <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/">CS50 Web Project 2: Commerce</a></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Worked on Python and SQL problems on LeetCode</li>



<li>Worked on Python problems on Codewars</li>



<li>Worked through <a href="https://www.mostlypython.com/django-from-first-principles-2/">Django from first principles</a> series (parts 1–7)</li>
</ul>



<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>I had lost momentum on CS50 Web Project 2 and didn’t have a very clear understanding of Django models, so I decided to take a step back and spend time with other resources to understand Django better before getting back to the project. I was interested in the Django from first principles series from Eric Matthes at <a href="https://www.mostlypython.com/">Mostly Python</a> after hearing about it on a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0fTlTXEgoZxmQOjk8z4C1M?si=4b3fe3142b774e48">podcast episode</a>. It was nice to switch to a text-based code-along tutorial after struggling to make progress on the CS50 project after watching a video lecture on the topic a month ago.</li>



<li>In <a href="https://www.mostlypython.com/django-from-first-principles-part-2/">part 2</a> of Django from first principles, Eric Matthes suggests taking a look at a piece of the Django source code. I took a look, and also found Copilot offering to explain that line of code. Matthes writes:</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p>If you’re brand new to Django, don’t spend much time trying to understand this code right now. You should keep in mind as you’re learning Django, however, that all the source code is just a few clicks away. It’s not magic; it’s a lot of work over many years figuring out how to efficiently turn requests into responses. It’s kind of nice to see the simple line <code>return response</code>. That’s the core of what Django does.</p>

<li>Installed <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow">Glow</a> and played around with it. It’s a markdown reader for the terminal. I’ve wanted to do something with Charm libraries but I also want to stay focused on Python/Django for now and not Go. This was a fun way to get started.</li>
