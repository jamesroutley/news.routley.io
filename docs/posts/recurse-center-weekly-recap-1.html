    <h1>Recurse Center Weekly Recap #1</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>While I&#39;m at Recurse Center, I&#39;ll be posting a reflection at the end of each week. I&#39;m going to try to keep these brief. I&#39;ll focus on recapping things I learned, programs I worked on, and technical challenges. But I&#39;ll also cover interactions with other Recursers.</p>
<p>This first week was exciting and slightly overwhelming. I barely wrote any code. My time was spent meeting other Recursers, learning about their backgrounds and what they&#39;re planning to work on.</p>
<p>Everyone I&#39;ve met is phenomenally kind, interesting, and interested. I was excited to connect with a few people who share some of my interests. Namely, build web apps with Python (Django/Flask) back-ends, machine learning, and blockchain. I&#39;m looking forward to starting to work with some of them soon.</p>
<p>The week was filled with more interesting moments than I could recount. Here&#39;s a few that stick out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone demoed an exceptionally fast algorithm for calculating the Nth position in the Fibonacci series using matrix multiplication.</li>
<li>I met a group of others who are interested in training and deploying ML models. We&#39;re going to set up a weekly ML practitioners meeting.</li>
<li>I pair programmed with two engineers with far more experience than myself. I felt nervous for a moment, then had fun once we got into it.</li>
<li>I was talking about redoing my personal site with Django and someone instantly sent me the open source code for theirs.</li>
<li>I got feedback and refined what I want to work on just by means of giving my elevator pitch dozens of times over the week.</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought about my curriculum a lot before this week. Most the conversations I had made me feel that I had outlined the right approach for myself, but they also illuminated areas where I might want to double down or ease up. I definitely feel that my plan to focus on Python (building web apps, reviewing my CS fundamentals) is the right way to start. Although I had been a bit burnt out at my job, I could feel how strong my interest in ML still is. So I also felt a confirmation of my desire to spend some time focused on that here. I also am looking forward to working on algorithms, more so than I was before this week.</p>
<p>Another realization that came from my conversations this week was that if I&#39;m not particularly interested in front-end development at the moment, there&#39;s no need to focus on it. So I&#39;m going to take that to heart and really focus on building interesting backend services. I&#39;ll take a semi-functional approach with the front-end. Learning what I need to allow myself to express what I want. I am still planning to spend a week or two diving into React and JavaScript. I have a few reasons I want to do this. One, I want to see what all the React hype is about. Two, I want to be able to collaborate with others. Three, I don&#39;t want to feel constrained by my front-end skills. But I&#39;m going to try to take a functional approach. For example, allowing my projects to dictate what I learn as opposed to diving deep into area&#39;s of JavaScript or React just for the sake of it. I&#39;m saving my deep dive energy for the things I&#39;m focused on.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very excited to get into it this week. Although I didn&#39;t have too much time to program last week, I got myself ready to hit the ground running this week. I reviewed my old Django projects, spun up a toy app or two, and explored Flask a bit as well.</p>
<p>This week I&#39;ll be laser focused on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting through the book <em>Django for API&#39;s</em> by William Vincent</li>
<li>Completing chapter two of <em>Composing Programs</em> which focuses on the concept of abstraction.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I can get that done and be in a good place to start building a few projects of my own with Django Rest Framework, I&#39;ll be happy.</p>
<p>Outside of programming, my biggest focus for this week is forming and sticking to a routine for myself. A few members of the RC faculty pointed something interesting out this week that I hadn&#39;t thought about before. RC is a wonderful chance to program and learn. But it&#39;s also a rare chance to experiment with something that is rarely so completely in your control: how you spend your time. I think there&#39;s something big to that. With that in mind, I&#39;m going to lay out a bit of a schedule for myself to start. But I want to spend a bit of time every Sunday reflecting and thinking about where I might tweak, experiment, or completely do away with that routine. I&#39;d like to keep a mindset of continuous observation and adjustment - like a pilot during a plane&#39;s landing.</p>
<p>In a way, this coming week feels like the first real one. I&#39;m excited to get to it.</p>
