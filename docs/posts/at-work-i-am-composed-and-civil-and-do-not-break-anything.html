<div><p>Two short speculative stories about coping and related struggles. <a href="http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/dragons/">&#34;Dragons&#34; by Teresa Milbrodt</a> (published this year) has a hard-to-quit video game: <i>“I&#39;ve thought about getting glasses,” the dragon said as we sat on rocks with mugs in our hands and the tin of butter cookies on another rock between us. The dragon even had cloth napkins, which hid the gaping wound in my abdomen.</i> <a href="http://www.glittership.com/2017/04/13/episode-36-how-to-remember-to-forget-to-remember-the-old-war-by-rb-lemberg/">“How to Remember to Forget to Remember the Old War” by R.B. Lemberg</a> (content note for self-harm): <i>&#34;I am luckier than most. Numbers come easy to me, and I look grave and presentable in my heavy jackets that are not armor.&#34;</i> The Lemberg story is also available in audio.</p></div>
