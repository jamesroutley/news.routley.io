<ul>
<li>skip this if you are already familiar with TLA+</li>
<li>TLA+ is fun and useful, and it is very rigorous. So my original plan to go fast and wrap it into my project turned out to be overaly optimistic</li>
<li>but I learned a lot, and absolutely will continue this learning journey</li>
</ul>

<p>
I am currently participating the wonderful <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=20cccbfea0852a9738b0c4d200b1a091">Recurse Center in Brooklyn</a> and I’ve long had this idea to create some sort of simulation game for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiApm-OFfsY">oncall engineers</a>. Wouldn’t it be amazing if we have some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)">Monopoly</a> like board game, backed by a formal specification system like <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html">TLA+</a> to verify the incident response actions we take during oncalls, I think it would be helpful for those traumatic <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/pes/">3AM firefighting</a>.</p>
<p>
The idea was to prepare some scenrios for how things could break and a selection of different mitigations a player could take to recover the service, and have TLA+ providing feedback. And package this core idea into a web based board game people can play together.</p>
<p>
I was so naive…</p>

<p>
To get the models running as expected, I had to climb the learning curve, struggled a couple weeks even with the help from AI. It was a great learning experience, thanks to the great materials and <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/practical-tla.html?back-link=learning.html">book</a> from <a href="https://learntla.com/">Hillel Wayne</a>, and also the life saver <a href="https://github.com/tlaplus/Examples/tree/master/specifications">collection of examples</a>.</p>
<p>
Now it’s time to actually write the core TLA+ model, I started with a simple <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/serverless-multi-tier-architectures-api-gateway-lambda/three-tier-architecture-overview.html">3 tier app</a> as my base model.</p>
<h2 id="base-model">
Base model
</h2>
<p>
The 3 tier app’s got client requests, a server and a server queue, and also a DB and a DB queue. Pretty standard. It’s also got a queue for pending client requests. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/cyang-el/5f0c5a6bc42c53c82fb5537aea672993">whole base model looks like this</a>. To explain its parts,</p>
<h3 id="client-requests-state-transition">
Client Requests state transition
</h3>
<p>
We have a fixed number clients setup in the <code>.cfg</code> file, in this case just 2 clients,</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><span><span><span>SPECIFICATION Spec</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>CONSTANTS</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>Clients</span> <span>=</span> <span>{c1, c2}
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    Srvrs = {s1}
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    DBs = {d1}
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    MaxID = 1</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>PROPERTIES</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>AllReqsGetResps</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>NoReqStaysPendingForever</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>CONSTRAINT CombinedConstraint</span></span></span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
And for each client request, we made sure that there’s not too many concurrent requests coming from the same client, and also the queues are updated accordingly, notice there’s also a dedicated <em>pending queue</em> tracking all the requests that are currently pending in the whole system.  The request ID is just a seriel number that increments.</p>
<p>
And other not relevant variables stay unchanged in this state change,</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><span><span>ClientReq(c) ==
</span></span><span><span>    /\ ~\E req \in pendReqs : req.client = c
</span></span><span><span>    /\ Cardinality(pendReqs) &lt; 10
</span></span><span><span>    /\ clReqs&#39; = clReqs \union {[client |-&gt; c, id |-&gt; nxtID]}
</span></span><span><span>    /\ pendReqs&#39; = pendReqs \union {[client |-&gt; c, id |-&gt; nxtID]}
</span></span><span><span>    /\ nxtID&#39; = nxtID + 1
</span></span><span><span>    /\ UNCHANGED &lt;&lt;clResps, srvQueue, srvProc, dbQ, dbDat&gt;&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="server-receiving-requests-and-processing-state-transition">
Server receiving requests and processing state transition
</h3>
<p>
We have only 1 server in this case as shown in the .cfg file,</p>

<p>
The server’s got a queue in front of it to shelter it.</p>
<p>
It proceeds by checking the the client queue is not empty and picks the request with the smallest ID, i.e. the oldest. And then put it in its own bag and removes it from the client queue. Server politely accepting a request from client.</p>
<p>
And as before, other irrelevant variables stays unchanged.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><span><span>SrvrAcceptReq ==
</span></span><span><span>    /\ clReqs /= {}
</span></span><span><span>    /\ LET oldR == CHOOSE req \in clReqs :
</span></span><span><span>                     \A other \in clReqs : req.id &lt;= other.id
</span></span><span><span>           s == CHOOSE srv \in Srvrs : TRUE
</span></span><span><span>       IN
</span></span><span><span>        /\ srvQueue&#39; = srvQueue \union
</span></span><span><span>                      {[client |-&gt; oldR.client,
</span></span><span><span>                        id |-&gt; oldR.id,
</span></span><span><span>                        server |-&gt; s]}
</span></span><span><span>        /\ clReqs&#39; = clReqs \ {oldR}
</span></span><span><span>    /\ UNCHANGED &lt;&lt;clResps, srvProc, dbQ, dbDat, pendReqs, nxtID&gt;&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
And then the server process the requests in its queue. It takes the oldest request and make a “READ” query request to DB’s queue.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><span><span>SrvrProcess ==
</span></span><span><span>    /\ srvQueue /= {}
</span></span><span><span>    /\ LET oldR == CHOOSE req \in srvQueue :
</span></span><span><span>                     \A other \in srvQueue : req.id &lt;= other.id
</span></span><span><span>       IN
</span></span><span><span>        /\ srvProc&#39; = srvProc \union {oldR}
</span></span><span><span>        /\ dbQ&#39; = dbQ \union {[query |-&gt; &#34;READ&#34;,
</span></span><span><span>                              server |-&gt; oldR.server,
</span></span><span><span>                              client |-&gt; oldR.client,
</span></span><span><span>                              id |-&gt; oldR.id]}
</span></span><span><span>        /\ srvQueue&#39; = srvQueue \ {oldR}
</span></span><span><span>    /\ UNCHANGED &lt;&lt;clReqs, clResps, dbDat, pendReqs, nxtID&gt;&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="database-state-transition">
Database state transition
</h3>
<p>
Database proceeds in similar fashion, checking its queue is not empty, and then taking the oldest query, then “process” by removing the query from server’s process queue, system request pending queue, and its own queue. And adding the “result” to the <em>client response</em> set.</p>
<p>
And as before, other irrelevant variables stays unchanged.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><span><span>DBProcess ==
</span></span><span><span>  /\ dbQ /= {}
</span></span><span><span>  /\ LET oldQ == CHOOSE q \in dbQ :
</span></span><span><span>                       \A other \in dbQ :
</span></span><span><span>                          q.id &lt;= other.id
</span></span><span><span>     IN

</span></span><span><span>                                  response |-&gt; dbDat[CHOOSE d \in DBs : TRUE]]
</span></span><span><span>                 pendRec == [client |-&gt; req.client, id |-&gt; req.id]

<h2 id="temporal-properties">
Temporal Properties
</h2>
<p>
One of the core ideas of TLA+ is to verify certain system specification against some set of <strong>Temporal Properties</strong>, it evaluates whether these properties hold over time, across multiple states, otherwise the system does not satisfy its design. <a href="https://learntla.com/core/temporal-logic.html">Read this if you want to know more</a>.</p>
<p>
This is exactly the thing I want to break during my <em>board game oncall incidents</em>, during an incident some specification has changed, the system is no longer acting the way it was meant to, failing its original temporal properties. And the game would ask the players fix it by applying one of the predetermined changes I provide (or so I thought…).</p>
<p>
I planned to have the Temporal Properties be SRE things we normally find in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement">SLA</a>. Metrics like response latency, uptime percentage, throughput…etc.</p>
<p>
As a start, as long as a request is processed eventually, it’s good enough,</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><span><span>AllReqsGetResps == &lt;&gt;[](pendReqs = {})
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>NoReqStaysPendingForever ==
</span></span><span><span>    \A c \in Clients : \A id \in 0..MaxID :
</span></span><span><span>        [](([client |-&gt; c, id |-&gt; id] \in pendReqs) =&gt;
</span></span><span><span>           &lt;&gt;([client |-&gt; c, id |-&gt; id] \notin pendReqs))</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="terminal-state-and-spec">
Terminal state and Spec
</h2>
<p>
I also added state to represent a state when there’s nothing left in all queues, adding it as a possible state transition and also one of the weak fairnesses ensures the end state is represented to TLA+. Hillel Wayne has <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/fairness/">explained weak and strong fairness perfectly</a>.</p>
<p>
Here’s what everything looks like when put together into a <em>Spec</em>,</p>

<div>
<pre><code><span><span>SysTerminate ==
</span></span><span><span>  /\ clReqs = {}
</span></span><span><span>  /\ srvQueue = {}

</span></span><span><span>        /\ SF_vars(DBProcess)

I put the .tla file and the .cfg file into the same folder, using TLA+‘s TLC (<a href="https://learntla.com/topics/cli.html#tlc">1</a> <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/7105ae3957700a9646cc4b766f5815b23ed0c682/pkgs/applications/science/logic/tlaplus/default.nix#L25">2</a>), I ran</p>

<p>
got these back from TLA+,</p>

<p>
seems alright, TLC has checked the state tree of my model, and has not found anything wrong, meaning with this setup, the client requests will eventually be processed.</p>
<p>
That’s it for part 1, in part 2 we will be adding metrics and time to monitor the system, and break its SLA by overloading it, to be continued…</p>
