    <h1>Fiber-infused ink enables 3D-printed heart muscle to beat</h1>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As Choi printed 2D and 3D structures using FIG ink, the cardiomyocytes lined up in tandem with the direction of the fibers inside the ink. By controlling the printing direction, Choi could therefore control how the heart muscle cells would align.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>When she applied electrical stimulation to 3D-printed structures made with FIG ink, she found it triggered a coordinated wave of contractions in alignment with the direction of those fibers. In a ventricle-shaped structure, “it was very exciting to see the chamber actually pumping in a similar way to how real heart ventricles pump,” Choi says.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As she experimented with more printing directions and ink formulas, she found she could generate even stronger contractions within ventricle-like shapes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Compared to the real heart, our ventricle model is simplified and miniaturized,” she says. The team is now working toward building more life-like heart tissues with thicker muscle walls that can pump fluid more strongly. Despite not being as strong as real heart tissue, the 3D-printed ventricle could pump 5-20 times more fluid volume than previous 3D-printed heart chambers.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The team says the technique can also be used to build heart valves, dual-chambered miniature hearts, and more.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>&#34;FIGs are but one tool we have developed for additive manufacturing,” Parker says. “We have other methods in development as we continue our quest to build human tissues for regenerative therapeutics. The goal is not to be tool driven – we are tool agnostic in our search for a better way to build biology.&#34;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
