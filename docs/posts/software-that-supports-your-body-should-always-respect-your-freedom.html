                   Software that controls your body should always respect your freedom.
This article is a recap of scandals of medical devices, like hearing
aids, insulin pumps, bionic eyes, and pacemakers, and what we can
learn from them. It&#39;s astonishing: you wouldn&#39;t expect these devices
to be run by software in such a way that they can leave you completely
helpless.

        <div id="parent-fieldname-text">
            <p>In July, users of the proprietary software app LibreLink, who live in
the UK and use Apple devices, found that the app they depend on to
monitor their blood sugar was not working anymore <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/07/14/glucose-monitoring-app-glitch-exposes-vulnerabilities-in-digital-health-tools">after the developer
Abbott pushed an updated for the app</a>. Monitoring glucose levels
helps people with diabetes to see when their glucose level is too low
or too high, which is a critical part of treatment.</p>
<p>&#34;This equipment is supposed to save your life,&#34; David Burchell, who
has type 1 diabetes, told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66203549">BBC</a>. &#34;And basically it broke, just
showing a white screen, and I had a panic. ... I was left without an
active test, other than the fingerprint testing. Pricking your finger
a hundred times a week is a nightmare.&#34;</p>
<p>Burchell deleted the app and tried to reinstall it to fix the problem
but said, &#34;when trying to redownload it, they&#39;d taken it off the app
store so I couldn&#39;t download it [again].&#34; Despite what its name may
suggest, there is nothing <em>libre</em> about the LibreLink app. It&#39;s
proprietary software, which means users must depend on the company to
keep it running and to distribute it. With <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">free software</a>,
Burchell would have had the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">freedom to run, copy, distribute, study,
change, and improve the software</a> himself, or he could have leaned
on a community of developers and users to share and fix the software,
<em>and</em> the old version of the software would have been available to
revert the update.</p>
<p>Two months later, with Apple&#39;s update to iOS 17, users of the
FreeStyle LibreLink and Libre 2 apps had reason again to fear that the
software they rely on wouldn&#39;t work after updating their iPhones. This
time, users all over the world were affected. In September, <a href="https://www.freestyle.abbott/content/dam/adc/freestyle/countries/ca-en/files/ios17%20update%20email_ConsumerEN.pdf">Abbott
warned Apple users</a>: &#34;As part of the upcoming iOS 17 release, Apple
is introducing StandBy Mode and Assistive Access Mode ... this release
may impact your experience with the FreeStyle Libre 2 app, the
FreeStyle LibreLink app, or the FreeStyle LibreLinkUp app. We
recommend that you disable automatic operating system updates on the
smartphone using the mentioned apps.&#34; This warning was made because
StandBy Mode would sometimes prohibit time-sensitive notifications
such as glucose alarms, and the Assistive Access Mode would impact
sensor activation and alarm setting modification in the app.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t the first time, unfortunately, that an iOS update has left
users of medical aids <em>to their own devices.</em> After updating their
iPhones to iOS 15.4 in the spring of 2022, some users of hearing aids
that connect to their phone via Bluetooth experienced problems pairing
their hearing aids to the app on their phone. A user who goes by the
pseudonym Bushness, for example, had the bass and treble sliders of
the Resound brand hearing aid randomly bouncing up and down after
updating the phone to iOS 15.4. Bushness discussed the issue with both
Resound and Apple. The user tried various trouble shooting techniques
but could not solve the issue. At some point, Bushness turned to the
Apple forum for help, but nobody could recommend anything the person
had not tried already. Bushness writes, <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253770006">&#34;Somehow I hoped maybe the
community had found something everyone else had missed.&#34;</a> If
Resound had instead chosen <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">to free their software</a>, however, then
this would probably have been the case. But with proprietary software,
nobody outside of the companies can look into the code and determine
what&#39;s wrong. Proprietary software leaves the community powerless.</p>
<p>&#34;It is only in the last few years that we have seen firmware updates
pushed out to hearing aids. At this stage, many of the hearing aid
brands provide occasional software updates to their hearing aids. It
appears to primarily happen with Bluetooth hearing aids, the so-called
&#39;Made For iPhone&#39; hearing devices. The hearing aid brands don&#39;t
necessarily tell us what the updates actually consist of, but they
appear to be pushed out around the time that there are changes to
iPhone operating systems. I would imagine that there probably is a
direct relationship. ... Every time Apple changes its iPhones, there
are connection issues with hearing aids,&#34; writes hearing aid blogger
<a href="https://www.hearingaidknow.com/question/do-hearing-aids-need-to-be-updated">Goeffrey Cooling</a>.</p>
<p>Resound eventually solved the issue Bushness and others were
experiencing after the iOS 15.4 update. But it took weeks, and that
illustrates how much users are at the mercy of the manufacturers when
the hardware they need to go through daily life requires proprietary
software in order to function.</p>
<p>What would happen if any of the Bluetooth hearing aids manufacturers
decided not to provide updates for models of which the warranty
expired? Well, if the software on these hearing aids were free (as in
freedom), then the free software community could help keep it
updated. But owners of medical aids that run proprietary software may
be disappointed to find out that they must throw their devices away
and buy a new pair, even if the hardware is otherwise still working
well.</p>
<p>And a scenario where a company abandons service or updates to its
users is not merely theoretical. This is the bitter reality faced by
users of eye implants produced by Second Sight Medical Products since
the company decided to <a href="https://rss.com/podcasts/l0wl1f3podcast/399912/">abandon the technology</a> in 2020 when facing
the prospect of bankruptcy. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/bionic-eye-obsolete">Terry Byland,</a> whose sight has been
dependent on the first-generation Argus implant since 2004, says of
his experience, &#34;As long as nothing goes wrong, I&#39;m fine. But if
something does go wrong with it, well, I&#39;m screwed. Because there&#39;s no
way of getting it fixed.&#34; That&#39;s what also happened to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/bionic-eye-obsolete">Barbara
Campbell</a>, whose retinal implant suddenly stopped working when she
was on a subway. This horrifying fate does not need to be a given for
people like Terry and Barbara. If medical aid companies distributing
software decided to release the software&#39;s source code under a free
license such as the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GNU General Public License v3.0 or later</a>,
then third party developers could help those people, but they haven&#39;t.
It seems that, when the going gets tough, they&#39;d rather leave their
customers helpless.</p>
<p>Medical aids that run proprietary software not only leave you at the
mercy of the companies when it comes to bugs and updates, but also
when it comes to cybersecurity. Some governments are trying to fix
safety problems with medical devices that run proprietary software by
issuing laws like the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7084/text?r=1&amp;s=1"><em>PATCH Act</em></a>, which requires manufacturers
applying for approval for their devices with the US Food and Drug
Administration &#34;to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and
effectiveness throughout the lifecycle of the cyber device.&#34; The goal
is to prevent scandals like those that happened in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/medtronic-insulin-pump-hack-app/">2019</a> and
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712808/medtronic-recall-insulin-pump-controller-cybersecurity-hack">2021</a>, when it turned out that <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/medtronic-defibrillators-security-dhs-advisory/">pacemakers</a> and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-warns-patients-and-health-care-providers-about-potential-cybersecurity-concerns-certain">insulin
pumps made by Medtronic</a> had vulnerabilities that exposed them to
attacks. One of the major problems with proprietary software is that
you have to trust the manufacturer to detect, communicate, and fix
bugs like these. Legislation won&#39;t cure this shortcoming. With free
software, you will most probably find someone who will try to crack
the device and detect any vulnerability.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">Free software</a> in medical aids helps the patient, the environment,
and the healthcare system. After all, the software in hearing aids,
insulin pumps and pacemakers controls parts of our body. We should be
allowed to control it. Software in medical aids has to respect our
freedom! Free software can make the medical device last longer. The
free software community can fix bugs and provide updates so that
patients are not left at the mercy of the companies. Then, patients
can <a href="https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/fight-to-repair">choose to repair</a> their device instead of throwing it
away. Last but not least, long-time support can save the healthcare
system <em>and its patients</em> lots of money.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is free software for hearing devices, such as the
software developed by the <a href="https://shop.tympan.org/">Tympan project</a>. The Open Community
Platform for Hearing Aid Algorithm Research project, funded by the US
National Institutes of Health, even developed a platform for real-time
audio signal processing called <a href="http://www.openmha.org/">openMHA</a>, licensed under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">GNU
Affero General Public License v3.0</a>, to improve assistive hearing
systems. Other medical aids, like an insulin pump, can also be run
with free software thanks to projects like <a href="https://openaps.org/what-is-openaps/">OpenAPS</a>.
Unfortunately, there is still a lack of free software for pacemakers.
This area offers an opportunity for the free software community to
contribute.</p>
<h2>Take action!</h2>
<p>It&#39;s up to us advocates of free software to inform the people around
us of the issues with proprietary software in medical aids. Let&#39;s
encourage our friends, parents, and grandparents to ask their doctor
about the software in their medical devices and to choose and insist
upon free software over proprietary software. You could start by
sharing this article with the people who are near and dear to you.</p>
