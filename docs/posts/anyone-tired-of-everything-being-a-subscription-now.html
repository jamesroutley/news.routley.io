    <h1>Ask HN: Anyone tired of everything being a subscription now?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Not newspapers or media services (though those can be annoying too), but products in general? It feels like it&#39;s getting harder and harder to just buy something in the tech world, especially when it comes to running programs on my home computer. Want a password manager? It&#39;s a SaaS now. Note taking app? SaaS. Image editor or office suite? SaaS (thanks Adobe...)</p><p>This is especially annoying given I generally refuse to rent anything in life, and will go out of my way to buy something upfront simply so there&#39;s no risk of losing it if finances get worse in future (or the wrong billionaire buys the company). Yet it seems like it&#39;s getting harder to do so, especially when open source products don&#39;t exist for that domain.</p><p>So yeah, why is that? And is anyone else tired of the constant barrage of subscriptions for things that should be one off purchases?</p></div></div></div>
