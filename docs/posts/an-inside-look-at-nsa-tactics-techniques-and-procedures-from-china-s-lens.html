This led me down a rabbit hole of research into TTPs that Chinese cybersecurity entities have attributed to the NSA – or, as they coin “APT-C-40”.</span></p><p><span>These insights stem from extensive research I did on Weixin containing intelligence reports published by China’s Qihoo 360, Pangu Lab, and the National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC). It is important to note that the authenticity and extent of these allegations remain unverified by independent sources. My goal in writing this blog is simply to aggregate and share what Chinese sources are publishing about NSA’s cyber operations (APT-C-40) to see if I could learn any new detection techniques or offensive techniques to research for fun. </span></p><p><span>As I did this research, I had a realisation that the Chinese methodology of Incident Response appears very different to how we perform IR in the West and had me thinking more about how I could modify some of my own methodologies to include some of the learnings. Maybe I will write a blog on this in the future. </span><span>Ultimately, depending on the reception of this blog, I may continue this series by sharing my other findings on Chinese reports regarding CIA (APT-C-39) cyber operations and a third North American group (not NSA or CIA) that Chinese firms are tracking named APT-C-57.</span></p><h2><span><b><span>How the

a leading institution specializing in aerospace and defence, allegedly became
the target of a sophisticated cyberattack attributed to the NSA’s APT-C-40 group<strong><span> back in 2022</span></strong>.
Reports claim that the attack was executed by Tailored Access Operations (TAO)<b>,</b> a
division within the NSA, which allegedly deployed over 40 unique malware strains
to conduct data theft and
espionage.</span></p><p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj1_qNmGNYlWzFND9G8S5z_yl4LZoMY4a8SyTn3vLjG59Fd_AcHGVgi-TnuLyR7fLlO4RU7x8_xeEnISpyqvj8FUX3Vp0n1x4cJedFKhFqSXEn_WBrMrR2GYolPc3FljVtJ0Dc3Q5JxiZNBV9gfdyXh7iYrozIX4Ud6lr5qbsia8RXZGBrOAuEv4rTuVk6g"><img alt="" data-original-height="847" data-original-width="730" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj1_qNmGNYlWzFND9G8S5z_yl4LZoMY4a8SyTn3vLjG59Fd_AcHGVgi-TnuLyR7fLlO4RU7x8_xeEnISpyqvj8FUX3Vp0n1x4cJedFKhFqSXEn_WBrMrR2GYolPc3FljVtJ0Dc3Q5JxiZNBV9gfdyXh7iYrozIX4Ud6lr5qbsia8RXZGBrOAuEv4rTuVk6g" width="1"/></a></span></p><p><span><b><span>How did China
perform the attribution?</span></b>Through the joint investigation and forensics on
the University, CVERC and 360 identified 4 IPs that the NSA supposedly purchased
through two cover companies “Jackson Smith Consultants” and “Mueller
Diversified Systems”. The four IPs identified are listed at the end of this
report. CVERC and 360 alleged a TAO employee with the pseudonym “Amanda
Ramirez” anonymously purchased these for the NSA’s FoxAcid platform which was
later used in the attack on the University.</span></p><p><span>Investigators from CVERC
and 360 were able to trace the attack back to NSA&#39;s TAO unit
through a mix of human error, patterns in their analysis and tool overlap. </span></p><p><b><span lang="EN-GB"><span>1. Attack Times</span></span></b></p><ul><li><span><span>One of the frameworks used by TAO that was
forensically uncovered during the incident named “NOPEN” requires human
operation. As such, a lot of the attack required hands-on-keyboard and data analysis
of the incident timeline showed 98% of all the attacks occurred during 9am –
4pm EST (US working hours).<br/></span></span></li><li><span><span>There were zero cyber-attacks on Saturdays and Sundays
with all attacks centralised between Mon-Fri.<br/></span></span></li><li><span><span>No attacks occurred during Memorial Day and
Independence Day holidays which were unique American holidays.<br/></span></span></li><li><span><span>No attacks occurred during Christmas.<br/></span></span></li></ul><p><b><span lang="EN-GB"><span>2. Keyboard Inputs</span></span></b></p><ul><li><span><span>Attacker used American English.</span></span></li><li><span><span>All devices used by the attacker had English OS and

of the alleged NSA “attackers” tried to upload and run a Pyscript tool, they
forgot to modify the parameters. This returned an error – the error message
exposed the working directory and file name of the attacker’s internet
terminal.<br/></span></span></li><li><span><span>This was then used to identify that they were running on a Linux
system and the directory “etc/autoutils” was known to be the special name of
the TAO network attack tool directory.</span></span></li><li><i><span>The error message is as follows: Quantifier follows nothing in regex; marked
by &lt;-- HERE in m/* &lt;-- HERE .log/ at .. /etc/autoutils line 4569</span></i></li></ul><p><b><span lang="EN-GB"><span>4. Tools Were Found Prior to Shadow Brokers Leak</span></span></b></p><ul><li><span><span lang="EN-GB">The </span><span>Northwestern Polytechnical University had
allegedly suffered multiple breaches throughout the years where several pieces
of malware uncovered in prior investigations (prior to Shadow Broker’s leak)
were allegedly the same tools described in the Shadow Broker’s leak</span><span>. They did not provide further information</span><span> on this.<br/></span></span></li></ul><p><b><span lang="EN-GB"><span>5. Toolkits related to NSA</span></span></b></p><ul><li><span><span>41 different tools and malware samples were identified
as a part of the investigation in the forensic analysis.<br/></span></span></li><li><span>16 of these tools were consistent with the TAO weapons
exposed by the Shadow Brokers leak.<br/></span></li><li><span>23 of the tools had around 97% similarity to the tools
in the Shadow Brokers leak.<br/></span></li><li><span>2 of these tools were not found in Shadow Brokers but
were seen used by TAO in other cyber-attacks (according to 360).</span></li></ul><p><b><span><span>Inside the Attack:
Alleged NSA TTPs </span><o:p></o:p></span></b></p><p><span>One of the NSA&#39;s
primary strategies in breaching the university was the use of zero-days.
However, to begin the attack the attackers first conducted a pre-attack
preparation phase with extensive work. Two zero-days were used to breach any
company with SunOS-exposed systems in neighbouring countries to China. 360 and
CVERC did not specify which vulnerabilities were targeted in their reports. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>Specifically, the
NSA would target any server with large network traffic (i.e. educational
institutions and commercial organisations). Once the attack was successful,
they would install NOPEN (more on this later) to establish a foothold. By
deploying zero-days on these systems, they established access on these systems
that would later be used as springboards for the main attack on the University.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB"><span>In total, 54 jump servers and 5 proxy
servers were used to perform the attack coming from 17 different countries
including Japan, South Korea, Sweden, Poland and Ukraine with 70% of the
attacks coming from China’s neighbouring countries. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span>The proprietary tool that was alleged to be run:<o:p></o:p></span></p><ul><li><span>SHAVER: This tool was used to attack the SunOS exposed servers that were used for the jump servers. This was identified as an automated exploitation tool designed for x86 and SPARC architectures with RPC services enabled.</span></li></ul><p><b><span><span>2. Initial Access into the University<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></p><p><span><span>To gain access into the network, they leveraged
MiTM and spear phishing emails. Around April, there were phishing emails
identified with references to “scientific research review” targeted towards
members of the University (students and teachers). These phishing emails
contained malware embedded in them and some were designed to steal credentials
from these users.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span><span>Aside from this, 360 and CVERC also reported that
one of the platforms used was a platform coined as <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/22069-document-01" target="_blank">“FOXACID” which was a part of the Snowden leaks</a>.
This platform according to Wikileaks, 360 and CVERC is a 0-day vulnerability
attack platform designed by the NSA to automate delivery of browser (IE, Chrome,
FireFox, Safari, Android Webkit etc) exploits to workstations, servers and
mobile devices. </span><span>When
a user tries to access a website like Gmail, BiliBili (Chinese YouTube) instead
of the normal server response, the response is hijacked to redirect to APT-C-40
(NSA) controlled server which injects malware onto the user’s browser. Below is
a diagram 360 drew of how it works (I translated it into English with Google).</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj1P0TE4Oh0Z4EQxcaQEnNlYSka8ToIPtvBoVoyBXm-POJpCFVgD6FyoAMAUz84CMKrSgm2X_LjWphSyUoJ4XSYznhIklIXF-YG4g31uydFzwqoOOiOyrD2G9wi0M6vEiSczvstxIpftVEZa_qdoHqt1R7UVf29mT-chOUS5MVG_BmXfm4NTIzhXaqMrXfw"><img alt="" data-original-height="1024" data-original-width="1379" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj1P0TE4Oh0Z4EQxcaQEnNlYSka8ToIPtvBoVoyBXm-POJpCFVgD6FyoAMAUz84CMKrSgm2X_LjWphSyUoJ4XSYznhIklIXF-YG4g31uydFzwqoOOiOyrD2G9wi0M6vEiSczvstxIpftVEZa_qdoHqt1R7UVf29mT-chOUS5MVG_BmXfm4NTIzhXaqMrXfw=s16000"/></a></td></tr><tr><td>Qihoo 360 - Diagram</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span><span>The question would be “how did they use FOXACID”
without having compromised systems? Based on the reports it seems like this is
a logical sequence of events:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><ol><li><span><span>External servers of the University were compromised
giving APT-C-40 foothold into the environment using a tool called ISLAND
(manual exploitation of Solaris systems)</span></span></li><li><span><span>APT-C-40 installed a framework called SECONDDATE an
</span><span lang="EN-GB">espionage software designed to be installed on network
devices (gateways, border routers and firewalls). There is a server and control
side to the tool. The server is run on the network edge device and the traffic
is monitored/tampered through a driver. The communication back to controller is
encrypted and the port used is randomised. Second date has capabilities of
network eavesdropping, MiTM, and code injection. It can be used with other
malware to perform espionage activities. It’s primarily used to hijack mass
amounts of data traffic, tampering and misdirection.</span></span></li><li><span><span>SECONDDATE redirects traffic from users within the
University network accessing popular sites like BiliBili to FOXACID platform
which performs the browser exploitation on the student/staff devices to gain
control. </span></span></li></ol><p><span><span>Using this MiTM platform, they allegedly hijacked
internal hosts and servers of the University before deploying further tools for
remote control of the systems. This allowed them access into core network
equipment, servers and terminals relating to ops and maintenance of the
University network. Of interest (and this appears to be a pattern), APT-C-40
(according to 360 and CVERC) had a keen interest on network devices like
routers and switches. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span><span>The proprietary tools that were alleged to be run
include:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span>ISLAND: This tool was
allegedly run against the University’s external servers to gain control. It is
a manual exploitation tool used to breach Solaris-based systems.</span></span></li><li><span><span>FOXACID: <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/10/how_the_nsa_att.html" target="_blank">Browser exploitation framework</a> that fingerprints the browser and deploys a 0-day. </span></span></li><li><span><span>SECONDDATE: This
tool was allegedly used by TAO (NSA) to hack into the office intranet of the
University. </span><span lang="EN-GB">Attribution of SECONDDATE was discovered through
collaboration with other industry partners. They found thousands of network
devices running this spyware – where the communications went back to NSA
servers located in Germany, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. This tool was used
to redirect user traffic to the FOXACID platform.</span></span></li></ul><p><b><span><span>3. Persistence and Lateral Movement<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></p><div>

<p><span><span>After securing
initial access, APT-C-40 focused on long-term persistence and lateral movement
across the university’s network. To avoid detection, they allegedly deployed a
combination of backdoors and credential theft techniques.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-GB"><span>SECONDDATE – Backdoor installed on network
edge devices such as gateways and border routers to filter, and hijack mass
amounts of data in a MiTM. This was placed on the border routers of the
University to hijack traffic to redirect to NSA’s FOXACID platform.</span></span></li><li><span><span>NOPEN: A remote-controlled
malware that provided NSA operators with ongoing access to compromised systems.
It allowed for file execution, process management, system command execution,
and privilege escalation. TAO used this to gain persistent control over core
business servers and key network equipment.</span></span></li><li><span lang="EN-GB"><span>FLAME SPRAY - Windows-based
remote-controlled malware with strong anti-analysis features. Can be customized
to generate different types of servers. Works with the &#34;Acid Fox&#34;
platform to control personal office network hosts. It has strong
anti-analysis/anti debug capabilities. </span></span></li><li><span><span>CUNNING HERETICS: A
lightweight implant that established encrypted communication channels for NSA
to remotely reactivate access points even after clean up attempts.</span></span></li><li><span><span>STOIC SURGEON: A
stealthy backdoor targeting Linux, Solaris, JunOS, and FreeBSD systems,
enabling the NSA to maintain control while avoiding security audits.</span></span></li></ul><p><b><span><span>4. Lateral Movement Techniques:<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></p><p><span><span>There was a keen focus from APT-C-40 on targeting
edge network devices. From the IR perspective this makes complete sense (lack
of EDR, lack of logs, lack of visibility and differing OS’s makes investigation
at scale incredible difficult and very manual). At this stage of the attack,
they used legitimate credentials to access firewall appliances and focused a
portion of the attacks on the telecom operators of the University. This was
highlighted by 360 and CVERC as their method of fingerprinting and accessing
personal data related to key researchers.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p></div><ul><li><span><span lang="EN-GB">Legitimate Credentials: NSA allegedly used
legitimate credentials for the Cisco PIX firewall, Tianrongxin firewall and
other equipment to scope out the intranet, monitor data, control the SMS
gateway and telecom operators. They then relied on other tools like MAGIC
SCHOOL to query sensitive personnel, encrypted the information and exfiltrated
it. The result of the queried data was saved to: </span><span lang="EN-GB">var/tmp/.2e434fd8aeae73e1/erf/out/f/</span><span lang="EN-GB"> before being encrypted and exfiltrated.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Hijacking Intranet
Upgrade Programs: The NSA allegedly compromised software update mechanisms to
distribute malware disguised as legitimate updates.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Credential
Harvesting via the tool DRINKING TEA: This tool sniffed SSH, Telnet, and Rlogin
passwords used by university IT administrators, granting NSA full access to
internal systems. </span><span lang="EN-GB">NSA allegedly used this to capture
command-line logs, passwords generated by University staff during their
operation and maintenance work. This data was them compressed and encrypted for
exfil by NOPEN. These credentials then gave them more access to edge devices
and business devices.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Hijacking Border
Routers: NSA installed Second Date spyware on university routers, allowing them
to intercept, manipulate, and reroute network traffic.</span></span></li></ul><p><b><span><span>5. Data Exfiltration: Stealing Critical Research
and Credentials<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></p><p><span><span>Once inside, NSA
operatives allegedly systematically stole classified research data, network
infrastructure details, and sensitive operational documents.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span><span>Exfiltration Methods Used:<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span>OPERATION BEHIND
ENEMY LINES: A suite of tools used to query, package, and encrypt stolen data
before transmitting it to NSA-controlled servers.</span></span></li><li><span><span>School of Magic,
Clown Food, and Cursed Fire: These NSA tools were specifically designed for
extracting sensitive files from telecom and defense research systems.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Use of Proxy
Servers &amp; VPNs: To avoid detection, stolen data was routed through 54 jump
servers and proxy nodes in 17 countries, masking the true origin of the
attackers.</span></span></li></ul><p><b><span><span>6. Evasion and Anti-Forensic Measures<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></p><div>

<p><span><span>To minimize the
risk of detection and forensic investigation, the NSA employed several
anti-forensic techniques (but most of these are inbuilt in the tools and
frameworks they leveraged):<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span>TOAST BREAD: A log
manipulation tool that erased evidence of unauthorized access, including UTMP,
WTMP, and LASTLOG files.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Encrypted
Communications: All NSA tools leveraged encryption, ensuring that traffic to
their command-and-control (C2) servers remained undetectable.</span></span></li></ul></div><p><span><b><span>What did I learn from this?</span></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span>There is a clear and structured
collaboration amongst Chinese cybersecurity organizations during casework.
While industry collaboration exists in the West through closed invite-only
groups, Chinese cyber organizations openly acknowledge and publicize their
partnerships. This openness was particularly interesting to observe and may be
influenced by cultural factors, such as the Confucian emphasis on shared
knowledge and a political framework that encourages collective efforts.
Additionally, this collaboration extends across borders, involving
cybersecurity entities from multiple countries.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>In the Incident Response process,
Western methodologies typically focus on constructing a super timeline of an
attack, detailing events in chronological order. We compile timelines, document
indicators of compromise (IoCs), and hand off reports to intelligence teams,
often accompanied by a verbal debrief. However, large-scale data analysis using
AI across multiple cases—or even on a single case—is not a standard practice. A
key observation from the Chinese case notes was the extensive use of big data
analysis, particularly in tracking “hands-on keyboard” activity. This approach enabled
Qihoo 360 to identify patterns, such as the alleged absence of activity on
Memorial Day, and precisely documenting the operational hours of the attackers,
allowing 360 to isolate activity to Monday-Friday, EST working hours.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>Attacks on edge devices, IoT,
and network appliances appear to be becoming the norm. From a threat actor’s
perspective, this makes complete sense. Most adversaries are aware that XDR/EDR
solutions are deployed on traditional endpoints, making edge devices an
attractive target for initial access and persistence. Defending and detecting
such threats is particularly challenging due to the variety of operating
systems, proprietary encoding methods, and the extensive manual forensic
analysis required. The focus on edge devices is not unique to the NSA—it is an
emerging trend that is likely to escalate. We have already seen Chinese APTs
and Russian actors adopting similar techniques, including firmware
manipulation. It will be interesting to see how this space evolves.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>Finally, across the reports,
there were sporadic mentions that most of the attack frameworks operated
in-memory, with no files written to disk. This is not abnormal to see –
however, it is interesting always to observe how the investigation and
forensics was done. One area I wish had been covered in more detail was the
methodology used to investigate these attacks, particularly how IR teams
conducted forensic analysis on edge devices and routers.</span></p><p><b><span><span>Alleged NSA IoCs</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></b></p><p><span><span><i>The IPs are redacted by 360 and CVERC (not me).<br/></i></span></span></p><p><span><span>209.59.36.xx</span></span></p><p><b><span><span>Weapon Platform IPs (C2 Servers):<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></p><p><span><span>192.242.xx.xx
