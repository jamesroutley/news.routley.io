At that moment, he was swept away into the crush of people trying to escape.</p><div><p>As the flames closed in, Nihei found herself at a Tokyo crossroad, screaming for her father. A stranger wrapped himself around her to protect her from the flames. As more people piled into the intersection, she was pushed to the ground. </p><ul data-layout="list-hierarchical-xs"></ul><p>As she drifted in and out of consciousness beneath the crush, she remembers hearing muffled voices above: &#34;We are Japanese. We must live. We must live.&#34; Eventually, the voices became weaker. Until silence. </p><p>When Nihei was finally pulled out from the pile of<strong> </strong>people, she saw their bodies charred black. The stranger who had protected her was her father. After falling to the ground, they&#39;d both been shielded<strong> </strong>from the fire by the charred corpses that were now at their ankles. </p><p>It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history. </p><div><div><div><p><img alt="Japanese government photo shows buildings aflame after World War II firebomb raid." data-src-mini="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200221235528-04-tokyo-bombing-anniversary-restricted-small-169.jpg" data-src-xsmall="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200221235528-04-tokyo-bombing-anniversary-restricted-medium-plus-169.jpg" data-src-small="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200221235528-04-tokyo-bombing-anniversary-restricted-large-169.jpg" data-src-medium="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200221235528-04-tokyo-bombing-anniversary-restricted-exlarge-169.jpg" data-src-large="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200221235528-04-tokyo-bombing-anniversary-restricted-super-169.jpg" data-src-full16x9="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200221235528-04-tokyo-bombing-anniversary-restricted-full-169.jpg" data-src-mini1x1="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200221235528-04-tokyo-bombing-anniversary-restricted-small-11.jpg" data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0, xsmall: 221, small: 308, medium: 461, large: 781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"/></p></div></div></div><p>As many as <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/V/index.html" target="_blank">100,000 </a>Japanese people were killed and another million injured, most of them civilians,<em> </em>when more than 300 American B-29 bombers dropped 1,500 tons of firebombs on the Japanese capital that night. </p><p>The inferno the bombs<strong> </strong>created reduced<strong> </strong>an area of 15.8 square miles to ash.

Curtis LeMay, commander of the US bombers in the Pacific. LeMay later launched airstrikes on North Korea and Vietnam and supported the idea of a <a href="https://prospect.org/world/u.s.-military-plan-nuclear-first-strike-1963/" target="_blank">preemptive nuclear attack</a> against Russia during the Cuban Missile Crisis in <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/cuban-missile-crisis" target="_blank">October 1962</a>.</p><p>Though US President Franklin Roosevelt had sent messages to all warring governments<strong> </strong>urging them to refrain from the &#34;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6563.1966.tb01752.x" target="_blank">inhuman barbarism</a>&#34; of bombing civilian populations at the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939, by 1945 that policy had changed.</p><p>After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the US was determined to retaliate. By 1942, Japan&#39;s empire in the Pacific was at its most powerful. US war planners came up with a target list designed to obliterate anything that might help Tokyo, from aircraft bases to ball bearing factories. </p><p>But to execute its plan, the US needed air bases in range of Japan&#39;s main islands.</p><p>With the invasion of the South Pacific island of Guadalcanal in August 1942, it began to acquire land for that purpose, continuing that mission by picking up the islands of Saipan, Tinian and Guam in 1944.</p><p>With that hattrick in hand, the US had territories on which to build airfields for its new, state-of-the-art heavy bomber, the B-29. </p><p>Originally conceived to strike Nazi Germany from continental US in the event Britain fell to Hitler&#39;s forces, the B-29 -- with its ability to fly fast and high and with large bomb loads -- was ideal for taking war to the Japanese homeland, according to Jeremy Kinney, curator at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Virginia.</p><div><div><div><p><img alt="US B-29 bombers in flight." data-src-mini="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200220145325-b-29-flight-small-169.jpeg" data-src-xsmall="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200220145325-b-29-flight-medium-plus-169.jpeg" data-src-small="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200220145325-b-29-flight-large-169.jpeg" data-src-medium="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200220145325-b-29-flight-exlarge-169.jpeg" data-src-large="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200220145325-b-29-flight-super-169.jpeg" data-src-full16x9="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200220145325-b-29-flight-full-169.jpeg" data-src-mini1x1="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200220145325-b-29-flight-small-11.jpeg" data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0, xsmall: 221, small: 308, medium: 461, large: 781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"/></p></div></div></div><p>The bombers were the culmination of 20 years of aviation advances leading up to World War II and were the first  to have pressurized, heated fuselages, enabling them to operate above 18,000 feet without crews having to don special gear or use oxygen masks.</p><p>That put them out of range of most anti-aircraft guns and gave them plenty of time before fighters could rise up to engage them, Kinney said. </p><p>&#34;The B-29 Superfortress was the most advanced technology of its time,&#34; he said.</p><p>And US war planners were ready to unleash it on Japan.</p><p>But the B-29s&#39; early attacks on Japan were considered failures. </p><p>The planes dropped their explosive loads from the high altitudes -- around 30,000 feet -- they were designed to operate at, but as few as 20% hit their targets.

       <div>
         <p>While the March 9-10, 1945, bombing of Tokyo was the deadliest raid of the war, for sheer totality of destruction it was eclipsed by the August 1, 1945, firebomb raid on <a href="http://www.toyamashi-kankoukyoukai.jp/en/historical/" target="blank">Toyama.</a></p>
         <p>More than 99% of the city, an industrial center of 100,000 people on the western side of the main island of Honshu, burned to the ground that night after a raid by 179 US B-29 bombers dropping napalm.</p>
         <p>More than 2,700 people were killed and 8,000 injured. But the atomic bombing of Hiroshima occurred just five days later, and Toyama&#39;s tragic story was all but lost in the closing days of World War II.</p>
