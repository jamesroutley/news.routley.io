    <h1>Hiking the Oak Woodlands</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<header><p>November  3, 2022</p></header>
<p>Golden Gate Park isn’t what you think of as a <em>hiking</em> park. It’s not
particularly naturalistic. The whole area used to be windswept sand
dunes, and was transformed by water piped in from Hetch Hetchy 70
miles away to resemble parks in New England, a completely different
climate.</p>

<p>There’s an exception, though: the Oak Woodlands. It’s the one patch
of native forest in western San Francisco, where coast live oak trees
have stood since before the arrival of the Spanish. And it makes for a
great transit-oriented hike, no car needed.</p>

<p>This is an easy 1.9 mile hike through the Oak Woodlands and the
adjacent, not naturally occurring but also pretty, Heroes Grove. You
can optionally extend it to a 3.3 mile hike with a strenuous climb up
to Stow Lake and Strawberry Hill. It starts at the intersection of
Haight and Stanyan.</p>

<p><em>By transit</em>: Take the <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/routes/7-haight-noriega">Muni 7
bus</a> from points east
(from East Bay, Civic Center BART is the best transfer point) to
Haight &amp; Stanyan. Or from the Mission, take the <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/routes/33-ashbury-18th-street">Muni 33
bus</a> to Haight &amp;
Stanyan. Or use any transit trip planner to explore other options: the
start point is also within a few blocks of the N-Judah, 21, 5, and 43.</p>

<p><em>By bike</em>: You can ride in from the east on Fell Street (has a
protected bike lane, but some dodgy intersections) or Page Slow Street
(usually calm, but one block is hilly). I’d recommend you lock up at the bike racks
at McLaren Lodge, two blocks north of Haight &amp; Stanyan, start by
walking west from there instead, and take the
<a href="https://sfrecpark.org/1617/Golden-Gate-Park-Free-Shuttle">free Golden Gate Park
shuttle</a>
back to your bike at the end.</p>

and Conservatory East intersection, curving west, and ending on the
JFK Promenade south of where Crossover Drive exits the park."/>
  
</figure>

<p>From Haight &amp; Stanyan, enter Golden Gate Park and walk on the park
trails northwest, passing the bocce courts, and cross Kezar at the
signal. On the far side of Kezar, turn right, then left on
<a href="https://sfrecpark.org/1538/JFK-Promenade">JFK Promenade</a>. Turn right
on Conservatory Drive East and immediately right again to enter the
Phil Arnold Trail.</p>

<figure>

moderately uphill and curves left. To the left of the trailhead, a
sign with a map announces the Oak Woodlands of Golden Gate Park. To
the right, a jogger is visible on JFK Promenade."/>
  
</figure>

<p>Enjoy the forest ambiance as the trail takes you winding around
through the oaks. In one place, there’s a fork where you can
optionally take some stairs to the right to a higher area with a bit
of a lookout, before merging back with the main path. That way is nice
too, but for my recommended hike, continue straight, past the
horseshoe pits.</p>

<p>When the trail completes its curve west, through gaps in the trees you
can occasionally see houses lining Fulton Street, and even the Bay and
the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. You’ll cross a lightly
trafficked road: Arguello, just below the intersection with
Conservatory Drive. The trail continues on the opposite side with
steps down.</p>

<p>Finally, the Oak Woodlands Trail ends at a T intersection with a paved
trail. Turn left. At JFK Promenade, turn right and walk the path along
the promenade, passing the Skatin’ Place on your right, among other
attractions. This is the least naturalistic part of the hike, but at
least there are no cars. (Vote <a href="https://safeparksforall.com/">No on I and Yes on
J</a> to keep it that way!)</p>

<p>You’ll be back in the woods before long. Just after you pass
over the ramp to the museum parking garage (at right), make a slight
right.</p>

<p>Pass the Blue Playground, and you’re in the Heroes Grove. A plaque
here memorializes San Franciscans who died in the first World War.
Stop to reflect if you like, and proceed under the beautiful
redwoods.</p>

</figure>

<p>Continue on this trail until you exit the redwood forest up some
steps, at the Rose Garden. Turn left and return to JFK Promenade.</p>

<p>This is the end of the hike, and you now have a few options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ride the <a href="https://sfrecpark.org/1617/Golden-Gate-Park-Free-Shuttle">free Golden Gate Park
shuttle</a>
back to the start point</li>
  <li>Walk north out of the park to the <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/routes/5-fulton">Muni 5</a> or
south out of the park to the 7, back toward the start
point and points east</li>
  <li>Walk back on JFK Promenade, making it a loop</li>
  <li>Add a strenuous but scenic extension by climbing Strawberry Hill</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="strawberry-hill-optional-extension">Strawberry Hill: optional extension</h2>

<p>Cross JFK, turn right and then left on the uphill path, entering a
wooded area. Just before you would come out at the Japanese Tea
Garden, turn right, up the staircase. You’ll emerge on Stow Lake
Drive. Walk left around the lake until you get to the stone bridge.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://teaandtechtime.com/images/oakwoodlands-bridge.jpg" alt="A stone bridge leads to the island in the middle of Stow
Lake."/>
  
</figure>

<p>Cross the bridge, turn right, and then slight left to climb to the top
of Strawberry Hill via the steep trail and steps. There’s a picnic
area up top, as well as great views. It’s worth doing a loop around
the hilltop. Then take the steps down to the east, turn left, and turn
right across the other bridge, and left to return to the Stow Lake
Boathouse. You can catch the shuttle here as well, or proceed north to
JFK Promenade.</p>

<p>I hope this showed you a new way to enjoy Golden Gate Park. If so,
please help get the word out to eligible SF voters to vote <a href="https://safeparksforall.com/">No on I
and Yes on J</a> to preserve the car-free
JFK Promenade, without which this hike would have much more traffic
noise and be way less calming. Voting No on I and Yes on J also
preserves the recently expanded hours for the park’s free shuttle.</p>

<p>I’m big on hikes you can do without a car, because cars are the
single biggest contributor to carbon emissions in California.
Getting there by transit helps preserve the great outdoor places we
love. I previously wrote about a much longer Bay Area transit hike in
the Fremont area, at <a href="https://teaandtechtime.com/2022/03/29/vargas_plateau_car_free_hike/">Vargas
Plateau</a>.</p>
