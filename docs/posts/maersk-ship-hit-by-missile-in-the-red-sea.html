<p>A Maersk containership has been hit by a missile in the Red Sea, the U.S. has reported.</p>
<p>The U.S. Central Command said the Singapore-flagged <em>Maersk Hangzhou</em> reported it was struck by a missile while transiting the Southern Red Red Sea at approximately 8:30 p.m. local time on Saturday.</p>
<p>The ship requested assistance and is said to be “seaworthy” with no reported injuries. The <em>USS Gravely</em> and <em>USS Laboon</em> responded to the incident, with the <em>USS Gravely</em> successfully shooting down two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen.</p>
<p>Maersk confirmed details of the incident in a statement to gCaptain. The vessel was traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait en route from Singapore to Port Suez, Egypt, when the crew observed a “flash” on deck. The vessel and crew are reported safe.</p>
<p>“At approximately 06:30 pm CET, when the vessel was 55nm southwest of Al Hudaydah, Yemen, the crew reported having observed a flash on deck. However, there is no indication of fire onboard the vessel, and we are currently working to ascertain the full details of the incident. The vessel is fully maneuverable and continues the transit north,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“Ensuring the safety of our crew is our utmost priority, and all necessary security measures are implemented to protect them,” the statement added.</p>

<p>The <em>Maersk Hangzhou</em> is a 14,000-capacity containership deployed on Maersk’s AE12-service between Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The incident comes has Maersk has been <a href="https://gcaptain.com/maersk-schedules-suez-canal-transits/">resuming transits</a> through the Red Sea with the establishment of the US-led Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG) naval coalition, while some other carriers have <a href="http://Pentagon Asserts Red Sea Safety, But Ship Owners Remain Skeptical">opted to continue to reroute ships</a> around the Cape of Good Hope due to safety concerns as the <a href="https://gcaptain.com/u-s-sanctions-entities-aiding-iranian-financial-support-to-houthis/">Iran-backed</a> Houthis have continued to carry out missile attacks against commercial shipping.</p>
<p>Maersk suspended transits through the Red Sea back on December 15 a day after a near-miss missile attack on the <em>Maersk Gibraltar</em> near the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, connecting the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden. The announcement by Maersk led to other operators also suspending voyages and redirecting ships around the Cape of Good Hope. Since then <a href="https://gcaptain.com/number-container-ships-avoiding-red-sea/">about half</a> of the containerships that normally transit the region have been rerouted. </p>
