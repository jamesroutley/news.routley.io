            This paper targets high-fidelity and real-time view
            synthesis of <span>dynamic 3D scenes at 4K resolution</span>. Recently, some
            methods on dynamic view synthesis have shown impressive rendering quality. However, their speed is still
            limited when rendering high-resolution images. To overcome this problem, we propose <span>4K4D</span>, a 4D point cloud representation that supports hardware
            rasterization and enables unprecedented rendering speed. Our representation is built on a 4D feature grid so
            that the points are naturally regularized and can be robustly optimized. In addition, we design a novel
            hybrid appearance model that significantly boosts the rendering quality while preserving efficiency.
            Moreover, we develop a differentiable depth peeling algorithm to effectively learn the proposed model from
            RGB videos. Experiments show that our representation can be rendered at over 400 FPS on the DNA-Rendering
            dataset at 1080p resolution and 80 FPS on the ENeRF-Outdoor dataset at 4K resolution using an RTX 4090 GPU,
            which is 30x faster than previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art rendering quality.
