					<p>Hey Shekhar, Yannis from the Database Group at GitLab here.</p>
<p>It is great to see your deep dive to our schema and all the details that you have pointed out!</p>
<p>There are much more to discuss that can not be seen by only inspecting a snapshot of our schema; the evolution of our schema during the years, how Ruby on Rails conventions have impacted it (especially in the early years), issues faced at the GitLab.com scale that force us to revisit our traditional database design thinking and more.</p>
<p>I was thinking of creating a video based on your post and discuss those and many other details. But we can also do it interactively if you want ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>If you are interested, add an issue on GitLab.com and ping me there (<a href="https://gitlab.com/iroussos" rel="nofollow ugc">https://gitlab.com/iroussos</a>)</p>
