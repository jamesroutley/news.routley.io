    <h1>Weekly Update: Friday, June 20, 2025</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

  <p>I am going to try weekly checkins at the beginning of the weekend. With my work schedule these days, I think this is more realistic.</p>
<h2>Accordion Task</h2>
<p><a href="https://quin10ko9.com/projects/accordion/">Accordion Task&#39;s project page</a></p>
<h3>Done:</h3>
<p>Redesigned the progress bar. Now it progresses when you check off tasks, proportionally to how long the task was originally scheduled to take.</p>
<p>Went through and addressed most Clippy Pedantic lints. Learned some cool language features I didn&#39;t know about, like this <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#manual_let_else">lint about <code>let else</code></a>, and this <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html?groups=pedantic#unnested_or_patterns">lint about nesting OR patterns</a>.</p>
<p>Added Clippy Restriction lints to identify prototyping code to clean up (like <code>unwrap</code>s and <code>dbg</code>s).</p>
<p>Decided that I&#39;ll prioritize making a webapp version and keep the TUI experimental for now. I am more experienced making things accessible in the browser than in a terminal emulator, and my wife is interested in trying Accordion Task if there is a browser version. I&#39;m at the point where having detailed feedback from a few people could help me stay on the right track.</p>
<h3>Next:</h3>
<p>For fun over the weekend I&#39;m trying to set up <a href="https://www.leptos.dev/">Leptos</a> for a trial and potential later use. I watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/V1cqQRmVAK0">video about Leptos</a> a while ago and thought the syntax looked appealing, and liked how it looks like it gives high control over the final product. I am worried about using WASM because my phone browser doesn&#39;t support it?! It is a new phone with <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>. I wonder if there&#39;s a setting to turn it on. (Update: It&#39;s <a href="https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/112708050929472969">opt-in on a per-site basis to prevent Just-In-Time JavaScript compilation</a> for security reasons.) Is there a way to compile WASM to JavaScript for backwards compatability as a fallback?</p>
<p>I need to figure out how to compile Leptos on NixOS: I might need to look into alternatives to my current simple solution, because I don&#39;t know to target <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> with the declarative installation yet. Might try <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/fenix">fenix</a>? ...but I still haven&#39;t figured out Flakes (Is it even possible to incrementally adopt them?) yet and that&#39;s probably making things harder.</p>
<p>I need to work through those Clippy lints to make the code more robust. Probably a good thing to do during my work breaks, because I am worried it might be boring.</p>
<p>I need to read about RustDoc and different philosophies around code documentation in general. There is a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html">RustDoc book</a>, and <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/">Write the Docs has a big guide</a>, which I might cherrypick from.</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting so close! Cleaning things up is a huge part of the work, but it feels much better to do it when you&#39;re excited to get to share.</p>
<h2>Self Hosting</h2>
<p>Set up a guest wifi on its own firewall group. I still need to make one for IOT devices (some home appliances my wife uses apps with), and then I&#39;ll be able to turn my ISP&#39;s gateway into a normal modem. That&#39;s the next step in debugging WireGuard access from my phone to the home server.</p>
<p>Some WireGuard resources that have been helpful for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf">original WireGuard research paper</a> has useful examples. Don&#39;t be scared away by the wall-of-text introduction!</li>
<li><a href="https://r.obin.ch/blog/2022/08/05/set-up-wireguard-on-openwrt">r.obin&#39;s WireGuard for OpenWRT guide</a> has been helpful in understanding how to attempt setting things up. I can now connect through WireGuard on my home network... from my home network.</li>
<li>The tip to try using WireGuard locally was very helpful. I got it from this <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/t/solved-wireguard-client-with-double-nat/152095/17">OpenWRT forum post about WireGuard troubleshooting</a>.</li>
<li>Reading about WireGuard has been intimidating because I don&#39;t know the terminology well yet. This <a href="https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2020/12/wireguard-terminology/">WireGuard terminology guide</a> has been helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learned <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-upgrading">how to upgrade NixOS</a> so I could compile Leptos. I hadn&#39;t realized you have to change channels.</p>
<p>My mom gifted me a small unmanaged network switch. I want to put the printer on it! I need a couple more short Ethernet cables before I can use it.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>My brother is on summer break and wants to play <a href="https://screeps.com/">Screeps</a> with me. I played Screeps when it first came out. I see that you can use any language that compiles to WASM now, so it sounds like a fun time to try again! Last time, I felt very overwhelmed. I bet I&#39;d be so much better at it now because I am better at abstracting and organizing my code. You can self host it. I don&#39;t really want to play with strangers, so maybe I&#39;ll try setting it up on my server.</p>
<p>I was having fun earlier this month writing about knitting math. I&#39;m drafting it in <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a> but would be transcribing it to MathML (I guess? I heard it has better accessibility now, but haven&#39;t done the research yet.) before putting it online. The Typst IDE really is a joy to write in.</p>
<p>I have to put together some art for an old game. I&#39;ll talk about it more when it&#39;s done!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.roguelike.club/event2025.html">Roguelike Celebration</a> is currently accepting submissions. I have an idea for a talk, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll submit in time for the deadline because of the surprirse art project (with a deadline) that I have to do now. Either way, it is a delightful online conference and I&#39;m looking forward to attending.</p>
<h2>Discoveries</h2>
<ul>
<li>I just finished the audio version of <a href="https://resilientwebdesign.com/">Resiliant Web Design</a>. It was a lot of fun. I definitely recommend if you like history or thinking about design. I am thankful for the audio version because I could listen to it at work. I wish more people recorded Creative Commons material for audio.</li>
<li>There is a new podcast called <a href="https://lolaslab.co/what-the-spec/">What the Spec?!</a> that I&#39;ve been listening to. It&#39;s interviews with web specifications people by someone trying to get into the field. I am enjoying it as someone who cares about accessibility and uses the web. It&#39;s incredibly hard to discover new podcasts unless they&#39;re already really big, so here you go.</li>
<li><a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGlRiJV2fwiMt0mwNkjpLMQobKuRpDLEl">Inside the Famicom</a> by <a href="https://whatskenmaking.com/">What&#39;s Ken Making</a> is a series on YouTube that examines the Famicom in delicious detail. I like the presentation that alternates between modalities including oscilloscope, circuit diagrams, close-ups, and animations. As an added bonus, the channel&#39;s opening sequence makes me really happy. It&#39;s just so exciting!</li>
