    <h1>I Lost Faith in Kagi</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
		

		<p>I&#39;ve posted many times before about paid search engine Kagi but I really wanted, like I have with other sites in the past, to make a post that just outlines why I don&#39;t have any faith in it.  Because the majority of my reasons come from being in their Discord, which tons of average users will never really look at, and I suspect a lot of Kagi supporters do not know a lot of this backstory.  This isn&#39;t a heavily researched deep dive or anything, I feel like I always need these kind of disclaimers when I&#39;m just posting my thoughts about something backed up with my reasons for thinking it...it&#39;s just a quick rundown of why I personally went from a Kagi subscriber to a Kagi Naysayer, so that I can have my reasons in one place that I can link others to.  And I have seen a lot of people recommend Kagi that I personally know would be a lot less interested in doing so if they knew this information, but they don&#39;t because it&#39;s not readily apparent just from using the site.</p>

		<p>For those unfamiliar to start with, Kagi is a paid search engine that purportedly focuses on privacy.  It&#39;s meant to be a no-nonsense platform focused on being the best search it can be.  Frankly, I think at this point it&#39;s a very nonsense-focused platform that has an extremely disinterested view of privacy, and I think it&#39;s not a particularly sustainable project either.</p>

		<p>First of all, as a project, Kagi stretches itself way too thin.  &#34;Kagi&#34; isn&#39;t just Kagi Search, it&#39;s also a whole slew of AI tools, a Mac-only web browser called Orion, and right now they are planning on launching an email service as well.  None of these projects are particularly profitable, so it&#39;s not a case of one subsidizing the other, and when they announced Kagi Email even their most dedicated userbase (aka the types who hang around in a discord for a search engine) seemed largely disinterested.  For products this niche, I don&#39;t think you can afford to be running multiple niche products at once.  Your developers are going to be running far too ragged to keep them all going.  Last I could find Kagi employs about 16 employees, half full time.  Presumably not every single one of those 8 or so full timers are web devs.  That&#39;s not a lot of people to throw at this many things.</p>

		<p>You see, when Kagi had a funding round and raised about $670k.  This funding came from an investment round including &#34;42 accredited investors, most of whom are actual Kagi users&#34;.  Unfortunately unlike Cohost I can&#39;t give any kind of huge financial breakdown here, because Kagi&#39;s finances are even less transparent.  If there are Kagi financial reports, I haven&#39;t seen them, just the occasional Discord comment from Kagi employees.  A while back they raised their prices, which lost them a lot of subscribers, because they were losing money per search at the old prices.  They were actually still losing money per search on the new prices.  They eventually lowered the prices back down a bit (and maybe raised them again?  I&#39;ve completely lost the plot on their pricing at this point) and have claimed that at 25,000 users they would be breaking even.  I am unsure what happened in all of this for this math to be true, but my point is that they did in fact reach at least 20,000 users, and to celebrate they set up a business entity in Germany (they are currently US based), in order to start a tiny little t-shirt printing company.  And their goal was to print 20,000 t-shirts to give out, FOR FREE, to their first 20,000 users (with users paying only shipping costs).  But I cannot stress enough, they did not just spend money on 20,000 tshirts to give out, they set up a whole new business entity in Germany to run their own t-shirt printing operation, with its own building and warehouse and employee(s? I get the sense it&#39;s one guy but I don&#39;t know).  And this cost them 1/3 of their $670k funding round.  One, fucking, third.  For t-shirts.  Did I mention that the t-shirts don&#39;t even have the Kagi name on them?  Just the Kagi dog mascot, who is at this point the only thing I like about Kagi, to the point where if I wasn&#39;t worried people would try to talk to me about Kagi I&#39;d opt for one of the shirts myself.  Great artist, whoever did this.  Terrible financial choice to start a whole t-shirt business to make 20,000 free t-shirts that do not even get your name out there.</p>
