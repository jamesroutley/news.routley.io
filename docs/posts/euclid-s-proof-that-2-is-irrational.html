<p>Euclid proved that √2 (the square root of 2) is an <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html">irrational number</a>.</p>
<p>He used a <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/proof-by-contradiction.html">proof by contradiction</a>.</p>
<p>First Euclid <b>assumed</b> √2 was a rational number.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/rational-numbers.html">rational number</a>  is a number that can be in the form p/q where p and q are integers and q is not zero.</p><p>He then went on to show that in the form p/q it can <b>always be simplified</b>.</p>
<p>But we can&#39;t go on simplifying an integer ratio forever, so there is a <b>contradiction</b>.</p>
<p>So √2 must be an irrational number.</p>
<p>We will go into the details of his proof, but first let&#39;s take a look at some useful facts:</p>


<h2>Rational Numbers and Even Numbers</h2>

<p>First, let&#39;s look at some interesting facts about even numbers and rational numbers:</p>
<p>Any integer multiplied by 2 gives an even number.</p>


<p>The square of an even number is always an even number (multiplying two even numbers gives an even number).</p>

<p>Example: the square of 14 is 196. 14 is an even
number, and so is 196. </p>

<div><p>
Example: 256 is even, and is the square of an integer, so its square root must be even.</p></div>
<p>Rational numbers or fractions must have a <b>simplest</b> form.</p>

<p>Example: 16/64 is the same as 1/4 (by dividing top and bottom by 16). That is as simple as we can get.</p>

<div><p>Example: 28/100 can be simplified to 14/50 (by dividing top and bottom by 2).</p></div>


<h2>The Proof</h2>

<p>Euclid&#39;s proof starts with the assumption that  √2 is equal to a rational number p/q.</p>
<div>
<p><span>
Assume:      </span>
<span>
√2 = p/q      </span>
</p>
<p><span>
Square both sides:      </span>
<span>
2 = p<sup>2</sup>/q<sup>2</sup>
</span>
</p>
<p><span>
Rewrite it as:      </span>
<span>
2q<sup>2</sup> = p<sup>2</sup>
</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>p<sup>2</sup> must be even (since it is 2 multiplied by some number).</p>
<p>Since p<sup>2</sup> is even, then p is also even (square root of a perfect square is even).</p>
<p>Since p is even, it can be written as 2m where m is some other whole
number (because an even number can be written as 2 multiplied by a whole
number).</p>
<p>Substituting p=2m in the above equation:</p>
<div>
<p><span>
Start with:      </span>
<span>
2q<sup>2</sup> = p<sup>2</sup></span>
</p>
<p><span>Substitute p=2m:      </span>
<span>
2q<sup>2</sup> = (2m)<sup>2</sup>
</span>
</p>
<p><span>
Simplify:      </span>
<span>
2q<sup>2</sup> = 4m<sup>2</sup>
</span>
</p>
<p><span>
Divide both sides by 2:      </span>
<span>
q<sup>2</sup> = 2m<sup>2</sup>
</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>q<sup>2</sup> is an even number (since it is written as 2 multiplied by some number).</p>
<p>So q is an even number.</p>
<p>Since q is even, it can be written as 2n where n is some other whole number.</p>
<p>Now we have <b>p = 2m</b> and <b>q = 2n</b> and remember we assumed that √2 =  p/q:</p>
<div>
<p><span>
Assume:      </span>
<span>
√2 = p/q      </span>
</p>
<p><span>
Substitute p=2m and q=2n:      </span>
<span>
√2 = 2m/2n        </span>
</p>
<p><span>
Simplify:      </span>
<span>
√2 = m/n       </span>
</p>
</div>We now have a fraction m/n that is <b>simpler than</b> p/q.

<p>But now we can <b>repeat the whole process again</b> using m/n and simplify it to something else (say g/h).</p>
<p>We can then do that again ... and again ... and again ... !</p>
<p>But a rational number cannot be simplified forever. There must eventually be a <b>simplest</b> rational number, but in our case there is not: we have a <b>contradiction</b>!</p>
<p>So something is definitely wrong here. √2 cannot be written as p/q or it can be simplified <b>forever</b>.</p>
<p>So √2 cannot be rational and so must be irrational.</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
