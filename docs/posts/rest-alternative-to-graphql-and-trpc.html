    <h1>Show HN: REST Alternative to GraphQL and tRPC</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GraphQL</em></a> is a query language for APIs developed by Facebook. It gives API clients full control over the data they query, making it extremely flexible and efficient for client-centric use cases.</p><p>Similar to <a href="https://www.openapis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAPI specification</a>, GraphQL APIs define a strongly typed schema for the data and mutations they support which makes them discoverable and intuitive to develop against.</p><p>OpenAPI stack achieves the same type safety and great developer experience by using the OpenAPI specification as a single source of truth for the API contract, used to generate types for both client and server side and utilising it for routing and validation during runtime.</p><p>Both GraphQL and openapi-stack encourage an <a href="https://openapistack.co/docs/api-first/">API First</a> approach where the API contract is treated as a first class citizen in software design instead of treating it as merely documentation.</p><p>While REST APIs don&#39;t generally provide the same level of control to clients as GraphQL, many times this could be seen as a benefit especially in scenarios where strict control over data access and operations is crucial.</p><p>Many organizations choose REST over GraphQL due to more established conventions, simplicity, and the ability to leverage standard HTTP features directly. Widespread knowledge around REST contribute to its choice among organizations looking for a tried-and-tested approach to building APIs.</p></div></div></div>
