    <h1>Ask HN: Are blog comments a thing of the past?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>So, someone built Blog Surf[0] and I spent my morning weaving through various blogs (since it has a directory), and first thing that caught my eye was that for every 5 blogs I checked, only 1 had comments open on article pages.<p>If I look at posts like this one[1] and this one also[2] - these are extremely detailed articles (very interesting too), but no comments? I am not pointing my finger towards the authors, either.</p><p>It&#39;s just weird that commenting is being pushed either to Twitter or email.</p><p>What do you think about this?</p><p>I fully understand that blog comments can be a pain in the butt to moderate when the average Joe just starts leaving &#34;Thanks!&#34; with a link to their website. But, it&#39;s perfectly normal to remove the ability for anyone to link back to their website.</p><p>[0]: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30844149" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30844149</a></p><p>[1]: <a href="https://wattenberger.com/blog/css-cascade" rel="nofollow">https://wattenberger.com/blog/css-cascade</a></p><p>[2]: <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/understanding-layout-algorithms/" rel="nofollow">https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/understanding-layout-algorit...</a></p></td></div></div>
