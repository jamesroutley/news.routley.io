    <h1>First Day at Recurse</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>Today is my first day at </span><a href="https://www.recurse.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Recurse</a><span> and I’m a mix of intrigued, nervous, excited and a bit overwhelmed. For those of you who don’t know about it (I didn’t either, my friend Michael Nagle introduced me to it recently), the Recurse Center is the equivalent of an artist/writer’s retreat but tailored for engineers, a sort of sabbatical focused on recharging and growing. It allows each person that participates to spend 6-12 weeks focused 100% on working at the edge of their ability on topics that they are curious about, learning new things and building cool stuff, and they do so along with the rest of the RC community</span></p><p>I’ve been working in the tech industry for over 10 years. In my journey I’ve done many things ranging from building distributed compute clusters to process large amounts of data to working on backend APIs for web apps, as well as getting my JS and CSS game on and diving deep into frontend work. </p><p><span>However, somewhere along the way I lost track of what </span><em><strong>I</strong></em><strong> </strong><span>wanted to do. I was able to continue learning and doing whatever was needed of me to make myself useful, and I never stopped to check whether the directions I was taking were fulfilling me. I became numb, my productivity started plummeting and eventually I found myself feeling all the symptoms of burnout. It took me a couple of years to recovery, and I sometimes I still feel like there are ways to go, but I’ll leave diving into the details of my burnout journey for another time. </span></p><p>That said, now that I’m back to feeling (more) like myself, I’ve found RC to be a really compelling program and community to propel myself back into working on the things I love. Moreover, I find the idea of doing so alongside folks of all different backgrounds, levels of experience and interests very motivating. </p><p>There are two main big threads that I’d like to follow and see where they lead. </p><p>Now more than ever, especially after the release of Dall-E, ChatGPT and the likes, everyone is incredibly excited about the prospects of AI/ML. And for a couple of years I’ve been wanting to go deeper into this field, but my attempts thus far have been interrupted by one thing or another.</p><p>As part of my time at RC, I want to work through the Fast.ai ML course. Ideally I’d like to see if I can reproduce the results of academic papers, and perhaps build on them. Some of these include:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00572" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Automatic Chemical Design Using a Data-Driven Continuous Representation of Molecules</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11427" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">DiffEdit: Diffusion-based semantic image editing with mask guidance</a></p></li></ul><p>I moved to Paris recently, and have been aggressively learning French over the last half a year. I’ve been using a mix of Duolingo, LingoDeer, Ank, Italki, Roam, Podcasts, Netflix and other things to aid in my learning and thus far I’ve been pretty successful. However, the overall quality of the tools available seems lackluster at best, and I feel like there has to be a better way. </p><p>I’d like to explore making something to help me in my learning process. To start out I want to build a simple chrome extension that allows me to easily add new Anki flashcards by highlighting a word in french, and it automatically looking it up in Wiktionary and creating the card for me. I’ve tried looking for something like this online, and perhaps my google-fu is off, but even something this simple doesn’t seem to exist (If you do end up finding something like that, let me know). </p><p>It’s appealing both because it seems totally doable, but for starters I’ve never built a chrome extension, and I have no experience with the inner workings of Anki other than knowing it is extensible using Python.</p><p>I can definitely see how LLMs + Language learning could be a very interesting combo, and I’m sure that there are folks out there already tinkering with ChatGPT (or the like) to build the next killer language learning app. It definitely seems like an appealing thing to try to tackle later on my batch.</p><p>Between now and my next check-in I intend to do a full chapter of the Fast.ai course, and have a basic chrome extension boilerplate code working in my local dev environment. Until next time!</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
