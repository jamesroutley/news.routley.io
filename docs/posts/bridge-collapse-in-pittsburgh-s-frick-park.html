    <h1>Bridge collapse in Pittsburgh’s Frick Park</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storyContent">

<p>At least 10 people were injured Friday when a bridge carrying Forbes Avenue over Fern Hollow Creek in Pittsburgh’s Frick Park collapsed, sending a Port Authority bus and several other vehicles into a ravine below, authorities said.</p>
<p>Three of those injured were taken to hospitals by ambulance, authorities said. None of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Two adults were taken to a UPMC facility in fair condition, according to a statement from the health system.</p>
<p>“We were fortunate,” Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey said at the scene of the collapse, noting there were no fatalities.</p>
<p>The bridge is between South Braddock and South Dallas avenues and is a major artery into Squirrel Hill from Regent Square and Wilkinsburg. It was last inspected in September, Gainey said.</p>
<p>Built in 1970, the 447-foot-long span is rated in poor condition and is restricted to vehicles of up to 26 tons, according to PennDOT records. Port Authority did not immediately respond to questions about the weight of the bus.</p>
<p>The bridge is used by about 14,500 vehicles a day on average, PennDOT records show.</p>
<p>There were three or four vehicles on the bridge when it collapsed at 6:39 a.m., said Pittsburgh Fire Chief Darryl Jones. Everyone who had been trapped was rescued, he said.</p>
<p>Jones estimated that rescue crews had to rappel 100 to 150 feet down the ravine to rescue motorists.</p>
<p>“They also did like a daisy chain with just hands, grabbing people and pulling them up,” Jones said.</p>

<p>A large, articulated Port Authority bus was among the vehicles involved, with the vehicle seen trapped on a section of the collapsed bridge.</p>
<p>The bus, Route 61B Braddock-Swissvale, was headed outbound on the bridge and was nearly at its east side when it began to collapse, authority spokesman Adam Brandolph said.</p>
<p>“We are extremely thankful that no one from the bus reported any injuries, and grateful for the first responders who risked their own lives to save others,” Brandolph said.</p>
<p>A ruptured gas line sent the smell of natural gas spewing into the community, a mix of homes and businesses. Crews shut off service to the line, Jones said.</p>
<p>The fire chief said authorities evacuated several families who live near the leak, but they were allowed to return by 9 a.m. He said gas service has been restored to all customers affected.</p>

<p>Police told drivers to avoid the area.</p>
<p>PennDOT closed the offramp from eastbound Interstate 376 to Edgewood (Exit 77).</p>
<p>Rescue operations ended at 8:30 a.m., officials said.</p>
<p>Howard Seltman, 67, who lives nearby on Briarcliff Road, called 911 after he heard the collapse. Dispatchers told him he was not the first caller.</p>


<p>“That bridge carries a lot of traffic every day,” he said from a trail below the bridge in Frick Park. “How does this happen?”</p>
<p>He said he heard a loud sound, followed by a rushing sound. The rushing sound got louder and Seltman immediately smelled gas.</p>
<p>“I never could have imagined that it would be that bridge,” he said.</p>
<p>Wendy Stroh, who lives on South Braddock, said she heard a noise that sounded like “a huge snow plow.”</p>
<p>“Just the thought of the bridge collapsing is a very scary prospect,” Stroh said. “I cross that bridge all the time.”</p>

<p>Mary Withrow, of Biddle Street, also described hearing a “horrible noise.”</p>
<p>“It was so loud you just wanted it to stop,” she said.</p>
<p>She said she has lived in the area her entire life and recalled playing under the bridge as a child.</p>
<p>“I just burst into tears, thinking about all the people that travel the bridge every day — my friends, my family, myself,” she said.</p>

<p>The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh said St. Bede Catholic School in Point Breeze has closed because of the bridge collapse. The school had previously been on a two-hour delay because of snow and road conditions.</p>
<p>“Many teachers and parents of St. Bede use that bridge every day,” Principal Sister Daniela Bronka said in a statement. “We are so blessed to have been on a two-hour delay. We pray for all involved.”</p>
<p>City Controller Michael Lamb said the bridge collapse “is a reminder that investments in infrastructure are investments in public safety.”</p>
<p>Allegheny County is home to more structurally deficient bridges than any other county in the country, Lamb said.</p>
<p>“If we do not act, events like this will, unfortunately, continue to happen,” he said. “I’m thankful there was no loss of life this morning, and we owe a debt of gratitude to the public employees who are supporting recovery efforts at the scene.”</p>
<p>The collapse came on the same day President Joe Biden is scheduled to visit Pittsburgh to talk about infrastructure.</p>
