        <p>It&#39;s the isotopes...
        </p>

        <p>In a recent
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/science/retired-nuclear-bombs-b83.html?searchResultPosition=1">article</a>
the NYT reports that in the US when nuclear weapons are retired they aren&#39;t destroyed but
just stored:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typically, nuclear arms retired from the U.S. arsenal are not melted
down, pulverized, crushed, buried or otherwise destroyed. Instead,
they are painstakingly disassembled, and their parts, including
their deadly plutonium cores, are kept in a maze of bunkers and
warehouses across the United States. Any individual facility within
this gargantuan complex can act as a kind of used-parts superstore
from which new weapons can — and do — emerge.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“It’s important to keep these parts around,” said Franklin
C. Miller, a nuclear expert who held federal posts for three decades
before leaving government service in 2005. “If we had the
manufacturing complex we once did, we wouldn’t have to rely on the
old parts.” He added that other nuclear powers can and do make new
atomic parts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not really surprised that the weapons aren&#39;t being destroyed
because it&#39;s incredibly hard to do so in a meaningful fashion;
it&#39;s not like guns where you just melt them down or something.
However, seeing why requires an understanding the
physics of the situation, so let&#39;s start there.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Wikipedia, which was indispensible in gathering the
background detail for all this. I also can&#39;t recommend enough Richard Rhodes&#39;s
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Atomic-Bomb-Richard-Rhodes-ebook/dp/B008TRU7SQ">The Making of the Atomic Bomb</a>,
which provides a very clear account of the physics of nuclear weapons, as well
as the history of the Manhattan Project.</em></p>
<h2 id="backgrounder%3A-atoms%2C-elements%2C-and-isotopes">Backgrounder: Atoms, Elements, and Isotopes <a href="#backgrounder%3A-atoms%2C-elements%2C-and-isotopes">#</a></h2>
<p><em>This section is elementary but important material on the
structure of matter. If you know what an &#34;element&#34; and an &#34;isotope&#34;
is, you can skip this.</em></p>
<p>Essentially all ordinary matter—the stuff you are made of and encounter
on a daily basis—is composed of atoms. An atom is composed of
three basic <em>subatomic</em> (i.e., smaller than atoms) particles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positively charged <em>protons</em></li>
<li>Negatively charged <em>electrons</em></li>
<li>Non-charged <em>neutrons</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At a super-simplified level, an atom is like a miniature solar system,
with a <em>nucleus</em> at the center, consisting of protons and neutrons,
and the electrons orbiting around it.
Atoms have the same number of electrons and protons, which renders
them neutrally charged. An atom can also gain or lose an electron
to become an <em>ion</em>, which is something we&#39;ll need to know later.</p>
<p>The chemical properties of an atom are dictated by the number
of electrons, and because the number
of electrons is the same as the number of protons in the nucleus,
the number of protons also dictates those properties.
Every atom with a given number of protons in the nucleus
(the <em>atomic number</em>) thus has the same chemical properties
(the technical term here is <em>element</em>). Each element has
a name and a one or two letter symbol. For instance,
hydrogen&#39;s symbol is &#34;H&#34;, oxygen&#39;s is &#34;O&#34;, etc. There
are 100 or so elements, but of course many more chemicals
because you can combine elements in a lot of different ways.</p>
<p>Finally, this brings us to neutrons. It&#39;s possible to have
different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus of an atom, even
with the same number of protons. For instance, you can have
three different flavors of hydrogen atoms:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Number of Neutrons</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hydrogen</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deuterium</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tritium</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Because the neutrons have no impact on the charge of the nucleus,
they also have no influence on the number of electrons, which
means that all three types of hydrogen have basically the same chemical
properties; they just have different masses.
The term for different flavors of the same element is
<em>isotope</em>, as in &#34;deuterium and tritium are two different
isotopes of hydrogen&#34;. It&#39;s standard to refer to isotopes
by the total combined number of neutrons and protons in the
nucleus, so, for instance, deuterium is H-2 (H for hydrogen).
Many elements exist in multiple isotopes in nature, though in many
cases one isotope is common and the others are rare.</p>
<h2 id="brief-overview-of-the-physics-of-nuclear-weapons">Brief Overview of the Physics of Nuclear Weapons <a href="#brief-overview-of-the-physics-of-nuclear-weapons">#</a></h2>
<p>I said above that chemical reactions don&#39;t create or destroy
atoms, but it&#39;s possible to have <em>nuclear</em> reactions which do
exactly that. There are several such processes.</p>
<h3 id="atomic-decay">Atomic Decay <a href="#atomic-decay">#</a></h3>
<p>Many atomic isotopes are <em>unstable</em>, which means that they
will spontaneously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Radioactive_decay&amp;oldid=1117714984"><em>decay</em></a>
into other isotopes by emitting some other particle.
For instance, the element uranium-238 decays by emitting
an <em>alpha particle</em> (another name for a helium nucleus,
containing two protons and two neutrons),
reducing the atomic number by two (the two protons)
and the atomic weight by four (the two protons plus
the two neutrons) and giving you the element thorium-234.
Thorium is itself unstable and decays by emitting a
<em>beta</em> particle (another name for an electron, see <a href="#below">radiation</a>) to give you protactinium-234m.</p>
<p>Different isotopes decay at different rates. The standard
way to define this in terms of what&#39;s called a &#34;half-life&#34;,
which is to say the amount of time it takes half of the
atoms in a given sample of an isotope to decay (alternatively,
the time after which there is a 50% chance that a single
atom has decayed). Shorter half-lives mean that an isotope
is more radioactive (because there are more decays per second);
longer half-lives mean that they are more stable.
It&#39;s possible to have isotopes with very long half lives,
on the order of thousands of years. Note that atomic decay
is effectively a memory-less process, which is to say that
if you start from X units of an unstable isotope, it takes
the same amount of time to get from X to 1/2 X as it does
to get from 1/2 X to 1/4 X.</p>
<p>In addition to releasing particles, this process releases energy,
in various forms, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Kinetic energy</em> from the new atom and the emitted particle
moving faster than they were before. These particles then
interact with the surrounding material, producing heat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#radiation">Radiation</a></em> in the form of x-rays, neutrons,
etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that radioactive isotopes tend to be warm or even
hot. In fact, it&#39;s possible to exploit this effect to power devices
for long periods of time in what&#39;s called a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator&amp;oldid=1122812386">radioisotope thermal generator (RTG)</a>.
RTGs are a common way to power spacecraft,
for the obvious reason that you can&#39;t easily get out there and
change the batteries.</p>
<p>One thing to notice here is that this is a one-way process,
with unstable elements decaying to produce other
lighter elements and energy. Eventually, the process
terminates when some relatively stable isotope is
produced, at which point you have a stable system and
a bunch of heat: see also the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&amp;oldid=1122962991">second law of thermodynamics</a>.
It&#39;s also possible to go from lighter to heavier products, as we&#39;ll
see below in the discussion of <a href="#fusion">fusion</a>.</p>
<h3 id="radiation">Radiation <a href="#radiation">#</a></h3>
<p>You&#39;ll often hear that various isotopes are <em>radioactive</em>
and that they emit <em>radiation</em>. In this context, radiation is more or less
the generic term for &#34;stuff emitted by various kinds of atomic
processes that you probably don&#39;t want to come into contact with&#34;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the
names of various types of radiation are incredibly
confusing, dating from a time period where the physics
of nuclear energy was poorly understood. When some new
form of radiation was discovered physicists would tend
to give it a name that just reflected that it was
something new, hence &#34;X-rays&#34; (with the &#34;X&#34; indicating
unknown) and alpha, beta, and gamma radiation,
names (according to Wikipedia, based on the degree to
which they penetrated matter). Now, of course, we
understand the actual physics a lot better, but the
old names persist. As a practical
matter, you&#39;ll hear about the following:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>What it actually is</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Alpha</td>
<td>Helium nuclei (two protons and to neutrons)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beta</td>
<td>Electrons</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gamma</td>
<td>High energy photons (i.e., light, but outside the visible range)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>X-rays</td>
<td>High energy photons, but typically lower energy than Gamma</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Neutrons</td>
<td>Neutrons</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These are all bad for you, but different levels of bad.
None of them will turn you into The Hulk.</p>
<h3 id="fission">Fission <a href="#fission">#</a></h3>
<p>Atoms can also undergo <em>fission</em> in which the nucleus splits
into two smaller nuclei, some other particles such
as neutrons, x-rays, etc.
Most relevant to us are the following fission
reactions, which we&#39;ll discuss shortly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Uranium-235 can break up into (typically) krypton-92 and
barium-141</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plutonium-239 can break up into (typically) zirconium-103
and xenon-134</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I say &#34;typically&#34; because fission is kind of a non-deterministic
process: the new nuclei need to have a mass that adds up to
the original mass (minus whatever other particles were emitted)
but there&#39;s some variation in which elements are produced.
The following figure shows the distribution of fission products
for some common fissile isotopes:</p>
<p><img src="https://educatedguesswork.org/img/fission-products.png" alt="Fission products"/></p>
<p>[From <a href="https://www.nuclear-power.com/nuclear-power-plant/nuclear-fuel/plutonium/plutonium-239/">nuclear-power.com</a>]</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible for atoms to spontaneously undergo fission
(more on this later), but more commonly it&#39;s the result
of external forces. Specifically, if a neutron impacts the
nucleus of an atom it can attach itself to the nucleus,
creating a new isotope that is one unit heavier. If this
isotope is unstable (as is reasonably likely, because
you&#39;re perturbing an isotope which is currently stable)
it can undergo fission.</p>
<h4 id="chain-reactions">Chain Reactions <a href="#chain-reactions">#</a></h4>
<p>Here&#39;s what we know so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>When an atom undergoes fission, it can emit neutrons</li>
<li>When a neutron hits an atom, it can cause it to undergo fission</li>
</ol>
<p>When you put these two facts together, you can have what&#39;s called
a <em>chain reaction</em> in which one atom undergoes fission and produces
enough neutrons to cause two atoms to undergo fission; in turn
those atoms emit more neutrons, and we have an exponential growth
process which results in the rapid release of very large amounts
of energy, in other words, an atomic bomb.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the process, also helpfully showing
that Uranium doesn&#39;t always decay into the same pieces.</p>
<p><img src="https://educatedguesswork.org/img/fission-chain-reaction.png" alt="Nuclear fission chain reaction"/></p>
<p>[Image by MikeRun from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nuclear_fission_chain_reaction.svg">Wikimedia</a>]</p>
<p>Note that it&#39;s not necessary for every neutron to impact a
nucleus in order to get a chain reaction as long as on average
the fission of one atom results in the fission of more than
one other atom. Nuclear reactors work by modulating the number
of neutrons that effectively impact other atoms, thus keeping
a stable reaction rate rather than one that is explosively
exponential. Describing how that works is outside the scope of
this post, however.</p>
<h3 id="fusion">Fusion <a href="#fusion">#</a></h3>
<p>It&#39;s also possible for two light atoms to come together to form
one heavier atom, in a process called <em>fusion</em>. The most relevant
case for us is that two <em>hydrogen</em> atoms (atomic number 1)
can fuse to form one <em>helium</em> atom (atomic number 2).
This is what happens in the sun, but can also be exploited to
build a much bigger bomb than a pure fission bomb. More on
this <a href="#thermonuclear-weapons">later</a>.</p>
<h2 id="making-an-atomic-bomb">Making an Atomic Bomb <a href="#making-an-atomic-bomb">#</a></h2>
<p>Once you have the insight from the chain reaction, it&#39;s a pretty straight
shot to the idea of an atomic bomb, and physicist Leo Szilard famously <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/leo-szilard-a-traffic-light-and-a-slice-of-nuclear-history/">invented it</a> while
waiting at a traffic light:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;In London, where Southampton Row passes Russell Square, across from the British Museum in Bloomsbury, Leo Szilard waited irritably one gray Depression morning for the stoplight to change. A trace of rain had fallen during the night; Tuesday, September 12, 1933, dawned cool, humid and dull. Drizzling rain would begin again in early afternoon. When Szilard told the story later he never mentioned his destination that morning. He may have had none; he often walked to think. In any case another destination intervened. The stoplight changed to green. Szilard stepped off the curb. As he crossed the street time cracked open before him and he saw a way to the future, death into the world and all our woes, the shape of things to come&#34;...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Quote from Richard Rhodes&#39;s &#34;Making of the Atomic Bomb&#34;]</p>
<p>It was almost 12 years from that moment when the first atomic bomb was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(nuclear_test)">tested</a> at
Alomogordo New Mexico. This test was the result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CiteThisPage&amp;page=Manhattan_Project&amp;id=1122077595&amp;wpFormIdentifier=titleform">three years of
work</a>
by over 100,000 people and an investment of over $23 billion in
current dollars, in the form of the US Manhattan Project.
This raises the question: if it&#39;s so straightforward, what took
so long?</p>
<p>In order to get exponential growth you need to have
on average more than one neutron emitted from the first fission event to
create fission in some other atom. Otherwise, you get an exponential
<em>decay</em> process where the chain reaction goes toward zero and nothing much happens.
If you just have a small number of atoms, then the most likely
thing is that a neutron will just be emitted outside your
fissile material and not contribute to the chain reaction.
You need a certain minimum amount of material in order
to get the probability of subsequent fission high enough that
you get exponential growth. This amount is called the
<em>critical mass</em> and depends on the specific properties of the
element you are using, and in particular (1) how many neutrons
it emits when it undergoes fission and (2) how likely it is
that when a given neutron hits an atom it will result in a
new fission event. The critical mass also depends on the shape (geometry) of
the fissile material, with a sphere being the ideal shape because
it has the maximum volume to surface ratio, which minimizes
the chance that the neutrons will just be uselessly expelled
from the surface.</p>
<p>OK, so we just need to collect enough material and presto,
we have a bomb. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not so simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting enough of the right material is hard.</li>
<li>As soon as you start to assemble the material into
a critical mass, it starts reacting, and so if
you do it wrong, the energy emission will cause it
to explosively disassemble, which isn&#39;t fun if
you&#39;re nearby, but produces a much smaller
bang than you were looking for (a &#34;fizzle&#34;).</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#39;s look at each of these in turn.</p>
<h3 id="a-materials-problem">A Materials Problem <a href="#a-materials-problem">#</a></h3>
<p>First, we have the problem of the right material. It
quickly became apparent that there was only one suitable
natural element: uranium.</p>
<h4 id="uranium">Uranium <a href="#uranium">#</a></h4>
<p>Recall that I said above that the uranium-235 nucleus
(U-235) can easily undergo fission. Fortunately for us, but
unfortunately for the purposes of making an atomic bomb, the 99% of
the uranium in the world is not uranium-235 but rather
uranium-238 (U-238), which does not readily undergo
fission when bombarded by neutrons (instead, it tends to form U-239, which eventually
decays but doesn&#39;t undergo fission, we&#39;ll want this information later).
This presents a problem because it means that most of the
neutrons emitted by U-235 fission don&#39;t lead to more
fission events and you don&#39;t get exponential growth, hence
no bomb. Or, more precisely, the critical mass of natural
uranium was improbably large, between 10 and 44 tons
(calculation by Rudolf Pierls, as cited by Rhodes). Not
something you could drop from a plane.</p>
<p>However, what people eventually realized was that if you
had <em>just</em> U-235, or even <em>mostly</em> U-235, then it was possible
to sustain a fission explosion with much less mass (the
first uranium bomb, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Little_Boy&amp;oldid=1122486278">Little Boy</a>,
used 64kg of uranium). So, now the problem just becomes
<em>enriching</em> the uranium so that you have a higher fraction
of U-235 than in natural uranium (Little Boy used 80% U-235).
This is where things start to get hard.</p>
<p>Traditionally,
there are two main ways to separate out a mixture of two substances:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Via chemical processes. For instance, this
<a href="https://www.webassign.net/sample/ncsumeorgchem1/lab_3/manual.html">lab experiment</a>
describes how to separate out the components of a common headache
medicine into acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), salicylamide, and caffeine,
by taking advantage of the fact that each component reacts differently
with different reagents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Via physical processes. For instance, given a mixture of alcohol
and water (e.g., wine) you can increase the alcohol concentration
in the mixture by heating it and collecting the vapor to produce
brandy; this takes advantage of the fact that alcohol has a lower
boiling point than water and therefore the vapor has more
alcohol than the original liquid.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, because U-235 and U-238 are both
isotopes of uranium, they behave chemically identically, so
chemical processes are more or less
impractical.
This leaves us with physical processes, but because the weight of
the respective molecules differs by only 1.2%, the physical behavioral
differences are very small as well, which makes any physical separation
process very inefficient.
Eventually, the physicists on the Manhattan Project settled on
two main approaches.</p>
<h5 id="gaseous-diffusion">Gaseous Diffusion <a href="#gaseous-diffusion">#</a></h5>
<p>In this approach, you create a gaseous form of
uranium hexafluoride and allowed it to slowly diffuse across
nickel barrier with very small perforations. Because the U-235
molecules are slightly lighter
than the U-238 molecules, they move across the membrane slightly
faster, with the result that if you stop partway the resulting
mixture on the far side has slightly more U-235 than the
starting mixture. Because this process is so inefficient,
you need multiple stages in which the output of one
stage is fed into another. To make matters worse, the
uranium hexafluoride is fiendishly reactive and toxic,
so very hard to work with. The result is difficult
industrial chemistry on a giant scale.</p>
<div>
<h4 id="multiple-lines-of-attack">Multiple Lines of Attack <a href="#multiple-lines-of-attack">#</a></h4>
<p>One thing that Rhodes does a great job of bringing out
is the extent to which the Manhattan Project involved
pursuing multiple lines of attack on the problem of
building an atomic bomb, with the hope at least some of
them would work. Some failed, of course, but at the end of the day, they
had two entirely different routes that succeeded,
with the result that the two bombs that were eventually
dropped used totally different technologies:
<a href="#gun-type-devices">uranium &#34;gun-type&#34; devices</a>
and <a href="#implosion-devices">plutonium implosion devices</a>.
Similarly, they purused three independent technologies
for uranium enrichment, of which two turn out
to be really useful.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="electromagnetic-separation-(mass-spectrometry)">Electromagnetic Separation (mass spectrometry) <a href="#electromagnetic-separation-(mass-spectrometry)">#</a></h5>
<p>The intuition
here is that if you ionize the uranium atoms so that they have
an electrical charge (I told you we&#39;d come back to ions) you
can then accelerate them with an electric field. If you then
apply a transverse (perpendicular) magnetic field, then the
ions will follow a curved trajectory, as shown below. Because the
U-235 ions are slightly lighter they will follow a slightly tighter
trajectory; you can then effectively set up a bucket and collect
them. Of course, it will be a very small bucket because you
are literally separating one atom at a time.</p>
<p><img src="https://educatedguesswork.org/img/calutron.png" alt="Calutron uranium separation"/></p>
<p>[The original diagram for electromagnetic separation.]</p>
<p>The scale of both of these processes was truly enormous. Rhodes
again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States was critically short of copper, the best
common metal for winding the coils of electromagnets. For
recoverable use, the Treasury offered to make silver bullion
available in copper&#39;s stead. The Manhattan District put
the offer to the test, Nichols negotiating the loan with
Treasury Undersecretary Daniel Bell. &#34;At one point
in the negotiations,&#34; writes Groves, &#34;Nichols ... said
that they would need between five and ten thousand
tons of silver. This led to the icy reply: &#39;Colonel,
in the Treasury we do not speak of tons of silver; our
unit is the Troy ounce.&#39;&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Manhattan project eventually ended up using both of
these processes, gaseous diffusion first, and then electromagnetic separation.</p>
<p>Even the more modern process involving high-speed centrifuges
involves a fairly significant investment. However, there is
a more easy way to get the fissile material you need to make
an atomic bomb.</p>
<h4 id="plutonium">Plutonium <a href="#plutonium">#</a></h4>
<p>Uranium is the only <em>natural</em> material suitable for making
a bomb, but element 94 (plutonium) works fine as well
well. Plutonium has two very convenient properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&#39;s relatively easy to make with nuclear reactors
because it&#39;s the result of U-238 reacting with
a neutron (see above). So all you need is
a nuclear reactor and some U-238 and you&#39;ve got
plutonium. In practice, reactors never run on
pure U-235, so they always produce plutonium,
even if it&#39;s treated as a waste product. Of course,
you can design your reactor to optimize the
production of plutonium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because plutonium isn&#39;t just an isotope of uranium
it&#39;s relatively easy to chemically separate from
the U-238 it was created in. I say relatively
because both plutonium and uranium are
highly toxic and the whole mess is intensely radioactive,
but fundamentally it&#39;s just chemistry; no need for
gaseous diffusion or mass spectrometers. Plutonium
itself comes in several isotopes, but the isotope
you get the most of, Pu-239, is the one you want for making bombs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For these two reasons, modern atomic bombs generally
use plutonium rather than uranium.</p>
<h3 id="assembly">Assembly <a href="#assembly">#</a></h3>
<p>Once you have your fissile material you need to assemble
it into a critical mass. This is a challenging process,
because, as noted above, once you start to bring the material
together it starts reacting even before the critical mass
is assembled. If you do it wrong, the energy emission will cause it
to explosively disassemble, but with a much smaller
bang than you were looking for (a &#34;fizzle&#34;).
In order to make a bomb, you need to bring the material
together very fast so that you get a lot of fission
before the critical mass disassembles itself (i.e.,
explodes). Even so, you typically only get a fairly
small proportion of the material reacting, but the reaction
is so energetic that you still get a big explosion.</p>
<h4 id="gun-type-devices">Gun-Type Devices <a href="#gun-type-devices">#</a></h4>
<p>Uranium bombs are comparatively simple to build, using
what&#39;s called a &#34;gun-type&#34; assembly mechanism, as
shown below:</p>
<p><img src="https://educatedguesswork.org/img/gun-type-weapon.png" alt="Gun type bomb diagram"/></p>
<p>[Diagram by Dake, Papa Lima Whiskey, and Mfield from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gun-type_fission_weapon_en-labels_thin_lines.svg">Wikipedia </a>]</p>
<p>This diagram shows a full weapon, but just focus on the
gray area in the center that represents the &#34;physics package&#34;,
i.e., the atomic bomb itself, not the stuff needed to
deliver it. Basically, a gun type bomb is what it sounds
like: you have a hollow &#34;bullet&#34; made of uranium and you
shoot it down a long barrel (originally literally
made from a cannon) at a cylindrical &#34;target&#34; also made
of uranium. When the cylinder contacts the target and
surrounds it the result is a critical mass, resulting
in an explosion. This all happens very quickly: you don&#39;t
even need to have something to stop the bullet because
the brief period when the target is passing through the
bullet is enough. And of course, once the reaction
starts, the whole thing will explosively dismantle
itself anyway.</p>
<h4 id="implosion-devices">Implosion Devices <a href="#implosion-devices">#</a></h4>
<p>You cannot, however, build a plutonium-based bomb using
a gun-type mechanism. Reactor-manufactured plutonium
is mostly Pu-239 but contains a small fraction of
Pu-240, which has a relatively high rate of spontaneous
fission. This rate is sufficiently high that as
the bullet and cylinder start to assemble a critical mass,
the reaction will start and the mass will prematurely
disassemble, with the result that you get &#34;fizzle&#34; rather
than a successful explosion.</p>
<p>Instead, plutonium bombs are built using what&#39;s called an
implosion system, as shown in the diagram below:</p>
<p><img src="https://educatedguesswork.org/img/implosion-weapon.png" alt="Implosion bomb diagram"/></p>
<p>[Diagram by Ausis via <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Implosion_Nuclear_weapon.svg">Wikipedia</a>]</p>
<p>In an implosion device you have a spherical core
(sometimes hollow and sometimes solid)
called the &#34;pit&#34;.
It&#39;s surrounded by explosives which compress the
pit in a spherically symmetrical pattern, thus
forming a critical mass which holds together long
enough to produce an explosion.</p>
<p>An implosion device is much less straightforward to build
than a gun-type device, in large part because it&#39;s hard
to get the explosives in the form of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shaped_charge&amp;oldid=1120095819">shaped charges</a> to actually symmetrically
compress the pit. As a comparison point, the world&#39;s
first nuclear explosion was a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(nuclear_test)">test</a>
of an implosion-type bomb. The physicists at the Manhattan
Project were so confident that the gun-type bomb would work
that the first one ever detonated was the bomb dropped on
Hiroshima, without any live testing at all.</p>
<p>Once you know how to do it, however, plutonium
is much more convenient as a material to use for weapons
because, as noted above, it&#39;s so much easier to obtain.
Moreover, at this point it&#39;s fairly well understood how to build
implosion devices, to the point where non-experts have
famously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jun/24/usa.science">designed</a>
plausible weapons without recourse to classified information.
And of course, at this point 9 total countries have
successfully built nuclear weapons (the US, Russia, the UK,
France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel).
In other words, the really hard part of building
a nuclear weapon is getting the plutonium in the first
place.</p>
<h3 id="thermonuclear-weapons">Thermonuclear Weapons <a href="#thermonuclear-weapons">#</a></h3>
<p>Everything I&#39;ve written so far is about fission type weapons,
which are the original atomic bombs. However, modern weapons
are frequently what&#39;s called &#34;thermonuclear&#34; devices which
are based on both nuclear fission and nuclear <a href="#fusion">fusion</a>
(aka &#34;hydrogen bombs&#34;).
The details are of course complicated, but briefly,
fusion takes place under conditions of very high heat
and so you use a fission explosion (the &#34;primary&#34;)
to initiate the fusion reaction (the &#34;secondary&#34;).
For reasons that are out of scope of this post, fusion
bombs can be made much more powerful than fission-only
bombs.</p>
<p>They&#39;re also substantially more complicated to design,
because, like implosion devices, you have to ensure that they
have time to fuse before they disassemble themselves.
Wikipedia has a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermonuclear_weapon&amp;oldid=1123622590">primer</a>
on the design of thermonuclear devices. Richard Rhodes&#39;s
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Sun-Making-Hydrogen-Bomb/dp/0684824140">Dark Sun</a>
contains a much more in-depth treatment of the history
and design of thermonuclear weapons.</p>
<h2 id="disposal">Disposal <a href="#disposal">#</a></h2>
<p>After 4500+ words, we&#39;re finally ready to address the question
we started with, which is to say, how one disposes of
unwanted nuclear weapons. As described in the aforementioned
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/science/retired-nuclear-bombs-b83.html?searchResultPosition=1">NYT article</a>,
the current practice in the US is mostly to disassemble them
and to store the parts, making it possible to reassemble
them later into similar weapons. The article leans kind
of heavily on the fact that this is surprising (true!) but
does eventually list three reasons why it might not
be a good idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The parts themselves (principally the pits) are a safety
hazard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are &#34;security&#34; issues, presumably that someone might
steal the parts and make their own weapon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That this doesn&#39;t really put them beyond use and so
isn&#39;t a real reduction in the number of weapons
because the US could readily make new weapons if it chose to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two primary assets that we might need to concern
ourselves:</p>
<ol>
<li>The plutonium pit itself</li>
<li>The rest of the weapon</li>
</ol>
<p>The situation with the rest of the weapon is simpler so let&#39;s
look at that first.</p>
<h3 id="the-rest-of-the-weapon">The Rest of the Weapon <a href="#the-rest-of-the-weapon">#</a></h3>
<p>The parts of the weapon other than the pit give you a head
start on building a new weapon in two ways. First,
if you just disassemble the weapon into pieces
then it&#39;s (presumably) comparatively straightforward
to reassemble them back into a functional weapon. You might
also be able to reassemble them into a similar weapon though
based on what I know, you would want it to be reasonably
similar to the original. In either case, this is almost certainly
easier than manufacturing all new parts and the necessary
associated supply chain.</p>
<p><img src="https://educatedguesswork.org/img/nuk-instructions.png" alt="IKEA instructions for building a bomb"/></p>
<p>[A lightly modified version of Midjourney&#39;s output
for &#34;ikea instructions for assembling a nuclear weapon, diagram, black and white, detailed, realistic --v 4&#34;]</p>
<p>Second, the parts embody the knowledge about how to build
a new weapon. As noted above, while it&#39;s helpful to have this
for building a fission device, at this point this is something
that can be reproduced fairly readily. However, thermonuclear
bombs are significantly more complicated to design and
quite easy to get wrong, so it would definitely be helpful
to have a reference design to start from. The fusion component
also seems to involve some isotopes of hydrogen (tritium
and deuterium), so it would be modestly helpful to have that
but my understanding is that it&#39;s not <em>that</em> hard to get
your hands on these isotopes. Deuterium in the form of
&#34;heavy water&#34; (i.e., heavy hydrogen and oxygen)
is <a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/aldrich/617385">readily available</a>
from chemical supply houses. So, while the article says
&#34;the nuclear warhead is the bullet-like cylinder at the back. It holds the plutonium pit and the hydrogen fuel, which gives the bomb its vast powers of destruction&#34;, my sense is that the
hydrogen fuel part is pretty easy to obtain.</p>
<p>But of course none of this is very useful if you don&#39;t have
the pit, which is necessary to start the whole thing off.
It&#39;s also fairly straightforward to destroy
these components, as they&#39;re fundamentally just hardware.
Not so, for the pit.</p>
<h3 id="the-pit">The Pit <a href="#the-pit">#</a></h3>
<p>The pit presents two problems. First, even without the rest of the components, the plutonium
pits can be reused to make new weapons, either with
a similar geometry to the current weapon, or melted
down and formed into the pit of a new weapon with
a new geometry. We know from experience that once state-level
actors get access to enough plutonium to build a bomb they
generally succeed. Of course, non-state-level actors might
have a much harder time building a bomb from raw plutonium.</p>
<p>Second, it&#39;s extremely difficult to destroy plutonium effectively
(some weapons are built out of highly enriched uranium and
that can just be diluted in U-238 and used for reactors).
Obviously, you can melt it down, but that just leaves you with
a chunk of subcritical plutonium which someone can re-form into
a new weapon. The plutonium is highly toxic, so you can&#39;t
just grind it up and scatter it around without causing huge
environmental impacts (watch <a href="https://www.hbo.com/chernobyl">Chernobyl</a>
if you want to get a sense of what I&#39;m talking about here).
You can&#39;t burn it because then you&#39;re going to have
oxidized plutonium in the air, which you don&#39;t want
people inhaling, and while you can of course
use chemicals to dissolve it, vitrify it, etc. you&#39;re still
left with an equivalent amount of plutonium, just bonded
to some other stuff, and so it&#39;s just a matter of (potentially
highly unpleasant) chemistry to get it back out again. In
other words, it&#39;s precisely the properties of plutonium that
make it attractive to build nuclear weapons out of that make
it so hard to dispose of.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also very difficult to store because while
an individual weapon may not be a critical mass, if you have
tens or hundreds of weapons you have to worry about them getting
close enough to worry about accidentally assembling a critical
mass just from proximity, which, would of course, be bad.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn&#39;t news to policymakers. As the NYT article
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations all made plans — with costs in the billions of dollars — to get rid of excess plutonium stocks, which grew rapidly after the Cold War because of arms disassembly. But no strategy has so far succeeded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best available option <a href="https://rlg.fas.org/s245nato.htm">appears to be</a>
seems to be to turn the plutonium into what&#39;s called &#34;mixed-oxide fuel&#34; (MOX) and
then using it to fuel nuclear reactors. Unfortunately, this doesn&#39;t
work super well for a number of logistical reasons, for instance
that many reactors can only use MOX for some of their fuel;
and of course we have an unbelievable amount of plutonium
lying around, not just from existing nuclear weapons but also
from the operations of normal nuclear reactors, which, as
noted above, create plutonium. The FAS report I linked above
is from 1993 and states that &#34;There is almost 1000 MT of reactor Pu (R-Pu) in existence now, with the amount growing by about 100 MT per year.&#34; (disposal of plutonium waste is one of the
big problems with nuclear reactors).
So, the situation is really quite difficult
even if we ignore disassembled weapons, which actually tend
not to be that big (recall that the pit weighs on the order
of a few kg).</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts <a href="#final-thoughts">#</a></h2>
<p>I don&#39;t want to spend too much time playing media critic here,
but I don&#39;t feel like this article did that great a job of
putting things in context. The implication of this article is that
the US isn&#39;t really serious about disarmament and so it&#39;s storing
all the nukes in pieces but not really destroying them in order to
have ready access later, and that
this creates all sorts of hazards. I&#39;m sure
that&#39;s true to some extent, but I think it&#39;s also necessary to
realize that actually destroying them is a lot harder than it
sounds and even if you were to do about the best we know how to do
and totally destroy all of the hardware
other than the pits, you&#39;d still be left with a large amount
of fantastically dangerous stuff which has to be guarded
for the next 100,000 years or so.
The critique that this material isn&#39;t being guarded does seem
like a reasonable one, but it seems like guarding it better
is the solution that we&#39;re left with.</p>
