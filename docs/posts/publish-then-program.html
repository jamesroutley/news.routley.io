    <h1>Publish then Program</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>When I started at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=8238c6d9149cbd0865752e535795d509">Recurse</a>, one of my goals was to write more, and more regularly,
particularly on my personal site.
But I knew I’d be tempted to spend time tweaking the site’s appearance and technologies
rather than actually writing.</p>
<p>So I set myself a rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can only spend time on the <em>implementation</em> of my site after spending an equal amount of time on <em>published writing</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/publish-then-program/illustration.svg" alt="Illustration of this rule. In order: a pencil; a computer reading &#39;new post&#39;; and references to HTML, CSS and Javascript."/>
</figure>
<p>The idea is something like a bank account, or <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp" target="_blank">RSU</a>, or similar.</p>
<ol>
<li>I spend X minutes writing an article.</li>
<li>When I <em>publish</em> that article, those X minutes “vest”.</li>
<li>I now can spend X minutes on my site’s style, serving, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unpublished drafts don’t count! I only get credit for what other people can see.</p>
<p>There’s a nice little reinforcement loop here.
Once I’ve built up and used a little “credit”,
I can write about the improvements and recoup the “cost”.
For instance, this post on <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/dark-mode/">dark mode</a> got me back some of the time I spent writing it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<!-- [Hannah] used a slightly different analogy: a fundraising thermometer, as some organizations in the US have. -->
<h2 id="is-there-an-app-for-that">Is there an app for that?</h2>
<p>I had the thought to implement the accounting within my blog:
include a little <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/" target="_blank">front matter</a> tracking writing time for each article,
sum over published articles, and separately track the time spent on non-writing work.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://mulias.github.io/" target="_blank">Elias</a> pointed out: I should only spend as much time on that functionality as I spend on <em>the article describing it</em>.
After all, the accounting function would be part of “the blogging software” too!</p>
<p>With that in mind, I’m not actually tracking the “balance” at the moment; I’m just using <del>vibes</del> estimates.
But if you try out this habit and like it, we could pair on a tracker – let me know your thoughts!</p>


<!--
# Ideas
- Existing time trackers
	- Separate item for each?
	- Additional state - "color" tags for incrementing / decrementing?
- Client-side JS
	- Storage is good
	- But desktop/mobile sharing is something I want. Save in a local file, share via syncthing?
- Server-side
	- Server? Server-on-tailnet?
- Integrated into Hugo/Obisdian?
	- Can Obisidan track "you spent this much time on this article"?
	- ...and then a Hugo plugin increments the time-available when an item goes from `draft:` to not?
