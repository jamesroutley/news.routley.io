The Online Safety Bill poses a serious threat to this protection, and could put UK citizens at greater risk.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Apple urges the government to amend the bill to protect strong end-to-end encryption for the benefit of all.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the government told the BBC that &#34;companies should only implement end-to-end encryption if they can simultaneously prevent abhorrent child sexual abuse on their platforms.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We will continue to work with them to seek solutions to combat the spread of child sexual abuse material while maintaining user privacy.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Online Safety Bill, currently going through Parliament, contains powers that could enable communications regulator Ofcom to direct platforms to use accredited technology to scan the contents of messages.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The government said these powers would only be used as &#34;a last resort, and only when stringent privacy safeguards have been met&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Recently Home Office ministers <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65686989">have also been highly critical</a> of Facebook&#39;s roll-out of the tech for messaging.</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>SOPA Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>WhatsApp also opposes weakening the privacy of its encrypted app</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Several messaging platforms, including Signal and WhatsApp, have previously told the BBC they will refuse to weaken the privacy of their encrypted messaging systems if directed to do so.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Signal <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64584001">said in February</a> that it would &#34;walk&#34; from the UK if forced to weaken the privacy of its encrypted messaging app.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Apple&#39;s statement now means that some of the most widely used encrypted apps oppose this part of the bill.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The government argues it is possible to provide technological solutions that mean the contents of encrypted messages can be scanned for child abuse material. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The only way of doing that, many tech experts argue, would be to install software that would scan messages on the phone or computer before they are sent, called client-side scanning.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This, critics say, would fundamentally undermine the privacy of messages.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In 2021 Apple announced plans to scan photographs on people&#39;s iPhones for abusive content before they were uploaded to iCloud but these were abandoned after a backlash. It has now clearly signalled its opposition to any measure that weakens the privacy of end-to-end encryption.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Routine-scanning"><span role="text">&#39;Routine scanning&#39;</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Its announcement comes as the digital civil liberties campaigners The Open Rights Group sent an open letter to minister Chloe Smith.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The letter, signed by more than 80 national and international civil society organisations, academics and cyber-experts, says: &#34;The UK could become the first liberal democracy to require the routine scanning of people&#39;s private chat messages, including chats that are secured by end-to-end encryption. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;As over 40 million UK citizens and 2 billion people worldwide rely on these services, this poses a significant risk to the security of digital communication services not only in the UK, but also internationally.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Element, a British tech company whose products using E2EE are used by government and military clients, has previously told the BBC measures in the bill that are seen to weaken the privacy of encrypted messages would make customers less trustful of security products produced by UK firms. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There is a growing expectation, the BBC has learned, that changes may be made to part of the bill which critics say could be used to mandate scanning. These could be included in a package of amendments to be revealed in the coming days.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But it is not clear what the detail of those changes might be, or if they will satisfy the concerns of campaigners. </p></div></article></div></div>
