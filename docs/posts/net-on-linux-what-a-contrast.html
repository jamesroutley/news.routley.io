    <h1>.NET on Linux: What a Contrast</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
Almost five years ago I wrote <a href="https://two-wrongs.com/dotnet-on-non-windows-platforms-brief-historic-summary.html">a brief history about <abbr>.net</abbr> on non-Windows
platforms</a>. I stumbled over that article now and it resurfaced traumatic
memories of navigating <abbr>.net</abbr> development on Linux and MacOS.
</p>

<p>
Even back in 2019, it was mostly fine to <i>run</i> <abbr>.net</abbr> code on Linux (in
production) but the documentation and tooling for development was not there at
all.<span><sup>1</sup> I got into <abbr>.net</abbr> development when my then-new employer was in the
middle of transitioning from <abbr>.net</abbr> Framework to <abbr>.net</abbr> Core, so my non-Windows
work computer ended up being a lab rat for all sorts of unexpected compatibility
problems. I still don’t fully understand why I thought it was a good idea to try
to port applications I wasn’t even able to <i>compile</i> – much less run – to the
new framework, but it worked out fine in the end. (It was not just that these
applications used the <abbr>fcl</abbr>, they also integrated with Windows functionality.)</span>
</p>

<p>
That experience was, and the article was written, when <abbr>.net</abbr> Core 2.1 was the
latest production-friendly release. In some sense, it was just yesterday, but in
another, it’s a world away. Even just two or three years later, the tooling and
documentation had improved to levels I didn’t anticipate. Today, I still write
<abbr>.net</abbr> code (for a different employer) and I can barely tell whether I’m on
Windows or Linux.
</p>

<p>
It speaks to how much an organisation with a big wallet and willingness to
invest can shift things in a brief amount of time – but also, I think, how other
companies (I’m looking at you, JetBrains) can set a standard for cross-platform
tooling that the original company is forced to live up to in order not to lose
too much market share.
