      Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based mail client for Unix
      operating systems.  The current stable public release version is
      2.2.6.  For more information, see the following:
    </p><p>
      Though written from scratch, Mutt&#39;s initial interface was based largely
      on the <!--<a href="http://www.myxa.com/elm.html">-->ELM mail client.  To
      a large extent, Mutt is still very ELM-like in presentation of
      information in menus (and in fact, ELM users will find it quite painless
      to switch as the default key bindings are identical).  As development
      progressed, features found in other popular clients such as PINE and MUSH
      have been added, the result being a hybrid, or &#34;mutt.&#34; At
      present, it most closely resembles the
      <a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/">SLRN</a> news client.  Mutt was
      originally written by
      <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~me/">Michael Elkins</a> but is now
      developed and maintained by the members of the Mutt development
      <a href="http://www.mutt.org/mail-lists.html">mailing list</a>.
