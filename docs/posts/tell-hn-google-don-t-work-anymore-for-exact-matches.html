      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>It&#39;s been a while since I have felt that Google&#39;s results have deteriorated. It takes a lot of tricks to find what I am looking for. Today an interesting case occurred that frustrated me a lot and is worth telling HN.<p>First, I was looking for a song and searched for: &#34;here were the dreams are born&#34; (I know I mistyped). One of the first results I found was this interesting story (Google results https://imgur.com/a/gUq4XVZ):</p><p>https://mechahuggermr.tripod.com/id66.html</p><p>I took the following sentence from this story and used it in the readme of an internal project:</p><p>&#34;David, we have been expecting you - this is what you have been searching for - this place, David, is where dreams are born&#34;</p><p>Some people wanted to know where this quote came from and could not find it on Google.</p><p>I also tested and cannot enter any combination of parameters into Google to find this page. I tried quotation marks, literal search and no hyphen. Nothing, it is impossible to find it.</p><p>Does anyone know what is going on here? Can someone do a magic call and find this page on Google?</p><p>Has Google&#39;s AI/BERT Enhanced Search reached a point where indexed pages can not be found?</p><p>All results were tested with a Brazilian connection and replicated in a Private Session on an US VPN.</p></td></tr>
