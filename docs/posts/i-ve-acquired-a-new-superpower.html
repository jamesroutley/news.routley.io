    <h1>I&#39;ve acquired a new superpower</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><p>Yesterday, I was browsing Reddit. Midway through my feed, I stumbled upon <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/toptalent/s/ZyjjQGvQiM">a video from a German TV show</a>, where a 9-year-old girl demonstrated her ability to quickly identify the difference between two seemingly similar images.</p><div><div><p>In one example, she was presented with two images of hundreds of coffee beans spread out on a table. To my eye, both images looked exactly the same. But it took her only a couple of seconds to call out that one coffee bean was missing on the left side of the image.</p></div><div><figure><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc60cb9d6-ff5a-4eb2-823a-c07963f46657%2Ff6337768-e52e-468e-82cf-4ab806968e7b%2FCleanShot_2025-01-10_at_17.32.45.jpg?table=block&amp;id=1775e32d-8082-80fd-9cbb-c0e55218ccfc&amp;cache=v2" alt="notion image" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p></figure></div></div><p>She repeated this with other images, always almost instantly calling out the differences. I was baffled. How is this possible?</p><p>I turned my attention to the comments to see how Reddit reacted to this genius of a kid. </p><p>The top comment immediately caught my attention:</p><figure><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc60cb9d6-ff5a-4eb2-823a-c07963f46657%2Ff7bf8fe4-a5c8-4b5f-8679-37de61e1f439%2Fimage.png?table=block&amp;id=1775e32d-8082-8069-9996-db00ac09c32c&amp;cache=v2" alt="notion image" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p></figure><p>Wait, what? This can&#39;t be the case.</p><p>I paused the video, trying to cross my eyes, but without luck. To give it another chance, I googled for &#34;simple spot-the-difference puzzle&#34; and tried again.</p><p>For a moment, the images just seemed to blur over each other. But then suddenly, the images seemed to lock together in the middle, creating a third image between the two others that I was able to focus on.</p><p>And the top Reddit comment was right. In the third image, some parts of the image stuck out. They looked a bit like they were shimmering or being lifted from the page. I was instantly able to call out the differences.</p><p>I went back to the more difficult images from the video. Having trained to cross my eyes helped. It took me a second, but I was able to cross my eyes and get the third image to lock in. And again, I instantly spotted a shimmering detail in the image—the one small difference between the two images.</p><p>In high anticipation, I demonstrated my newly found skill to my fiancée. She wasn’t as impressed as I thought she would be, but it still felt like I had just drunk a magic potion and gained a special superpower.</p><h2 data-id="1775e32d8082805196a6ffc8728533db"><span><a href="#1775e32d8082805196a6ffc8728533db" title="Try it out yourself"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Try it out yourself</span></span></h2><p>Down below, you will find an easy, hard, and superhuman spot-the-difference puzzle.</p><p>Practice on the easy one first, then work your way forward.</p><p>Here is the step-by-step technique, that worked for me:</p><ul><li>Get a bit closer to the screen so you can see both images clearly.</li></ul><ul><li>Now, cross your eyes and aim to overlap both images.</li></ul><ul><li>When the images are overlapping, try to focus on the image in the middle.</li></ul><ul><li>At one point, it should come into focus, and you can relax your eyes.</li></ul><ul><li>Now look at the image, and the shimmering details should stand out to you.</li></ul><h3 data-id="1775e32d8082809db060cf9aa4fff206"><span><a href="#1775e32d8082809db060cf9aa4fff206" title="Easy mode"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Easy mode</span></span></h3><figure></figure><div><div><details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary><div><figure><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc60cb9d6-ff5a-4eb2-823a-c07963f46657%2F2e699058-0f48-48bf-910a-dfa7b4a2f703%2Fimage.png?table=block&amp;id=1775e32d-8082-804c-8ca3-ee99bc0d50de&amp;cache=v2" alt="notion image" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p></figure></div></details></div></div><h3 data-id="1775e32d80828032aad2c0ca8b8ba0d8"><span><a href="#1775e32d80828032aad2c0ca8b8ba0d8" title="Hard mode "><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Hard mode </span></span></h3><figure></figure><div><div><details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary><div><figure><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc60cb9d6-ff5a-4eb2-823a-c07963f46657%2F6f10f52b-7dac-4444-81ae-d57cd18b8c0c%2FCleanShot_2025-01-10_at_15.05.27.png?table=block&amp;id=1775e32d-8082-8073-9e01-d018310ed968&amp;cache=v2" alt="notion image" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p></figure></div></details></div></div><h3 data-id="1775e32d808280e68a66e4429f9b5113"><span><a href="#1775e32d808280e68a66e4429f9b5113" title="Impossible mode "><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Impossible mode </span></span></h3><figure></figure><div><div><details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary><div><figure><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc60cb9d6-ff5a-4eb2-823a-c07963f46657%2F7e9de6b6-a07d-48b1-9211-8453183fd6ee%2FmJbMN.jpeg?table=block&amp;id=1775e32d-8082-807d-857f-df1d05d4390b&amp;cache=v2" alt="notion image" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p></figure></div></details></div></div><p><b>Update:</b> I’ve posted this on Hacker News and it sparked a thread of interesting comments and stories. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655870">Here a link to the post</a>.
