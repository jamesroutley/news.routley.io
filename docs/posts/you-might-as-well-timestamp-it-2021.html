    <h1>You might as well timestamp it (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In my 15+ years of web development, there are very few things I can say are unequivocally a good idea. <a href="https://changelog.com/posts/good-reason-experienced-devs-say-it-depends">It almost always does depend</a>.</p>
<p>Storing timestamps instead of booleans, however, is one of those things I can go out on a limb and say <mark>it doesn’t really depend</mark> all that much. You might as well timestamp it. There are plenty of times in my career when I’ve stored a boolean and later wished I’d had a timestamp. There are <strong>zero times</strong> when I’ve stored a timestamp and regretted that decision.</p>
<p>Why is that? Because any time a piece of data is important enough to store its truth/falsehood in your database, it’s likely important enough that you’ll eventually want to know <em>when</em> that state was set. It’s like the exact opposite of <a href="https://youtu.be/fPJohxVLJu0">YAGNI</a>. <em>You Ain’t Gonna Regret It?</em> 🤔</p>
<p>Even in the rare case that you <em>never</em> need that timestamp… what have you lost? Its cost is negligible, both in data storage and coding overhead. Your code merely needs to consider a <code>NULL</code> timestamp as <code>false</code> and any non-<code>NULL</code> timestamp as <code>true</code> and there’s your boolean use-case. An example, in JS:</p>
<pre><code>// using a boolean
let is_published = true

if (is_published) console.log(&#34;it&#39;s true!&#34;)
if (!is_published) console.log(&#34;it&#39;s false!&#34;)

// using a timestamp
let published_at = new Date()

if (published_at) console.log(&#34;it&#39;s true!&#34;)
if (!published_at) console.log(&#34;it&#39;s false!&#34;)
</code></pre>
<p>The ergonomics are darn-near identical. And you can pretty this up with a helper function called <code>isPublished()</code> which checks the <code>published_at</code> attribute. Basic stuff you already know, I’m sure!</p>
<ul>
<li>The next time you’re tempted to store an <code>is_deleted</code> boolean, reach for a <code>deleted_at</code> timestamp instead.</li>
<li>If you think you need an <code>is_hidden</code> field, try using <code>hidden_at</code> in its place. Live with that for awhile and then ask yourself if you regret the decision.</li>
<li>Or if you’re about to create a <code>has_signed_in</code> boolean? You’re gonna want to know when that happened: <code>signed_in_at</code> to the rescue.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Future-you</em> will thank you. 🙏</p>
