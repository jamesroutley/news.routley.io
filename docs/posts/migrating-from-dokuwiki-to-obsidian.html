    <h1>Migrating from DokuWiki to Obsidian</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>About a year ago, I decided to move all my personal notes from <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org">DokuWiki</a> to <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>.</p><p>DokuWiki is great software and has served me well, but I never utilized it to its full capacity. It’s biggest strength is that it’s a… wiki, and I was the sole user.</p><p>It made little sense for me to keep a service running when I could just have some Markdown files locally. And Obsidian provides a really nice UI on top of those Markdown files.</p><p>One reason I chose DokuWiki in the first place, is that it doesn’t need a database. All the content is kept in plaintext files. So if I ever wanted to move my notes elsewhere, it would hopefully be a painless process. In the end, I think it was a good choice, because the migration was quite simple.</p><h2 id="the-migration-process">The Migration Process</h2><p>These are the steps I followed:</p><h3 id="1-copying-the-data-folder-locally">1. Copying the data folder locally</h3><p>First, I needed to get the source text and image files from DokuWiki to my local machine. All of it is located at <code>/var/www/dokuwiki/data/</code> for a common installation. This directory contains all the text files and images that comprise the wiki pages. <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/config:savedir">This directory is configurable</a>, so check your configuration if you’re unsure.</p><h3 id="2-convert-all-text-files-from-dokuwiki-syntax-to-proper-markdown">2. Convert all text files from DokuWiki Syntax to proper Markdown</h3><p>The next step was to locate all the <code>.txt</code> files in <code>data/pages</code>. These files needed to be renamed to <code>.md</code>, and the content converted to proper Markdown.</p><p>DokuWiki uses its own syntax, which is not really used anywhere else.</p><p>I ended up writing a quick script to handle this, with some help from ChatGPT to speed up the process.</p><p>Main points the script covers:</p><ul><li>Changing DokuWiki’s heading syntax to Markdown format.</li><li>Adjusting link and image paths to work with Obsidian.</li><li>Handling any quirks like list formatting.</li></ul><h3 id="3-moving-media-files">3. Moving Media Files</h3><p>After the text files were converted, I moved all the media files from <code>data/media</code> to <code>data/pages</code>. Obsidian can handle images and other media in the same directory as the Markdown files, which DokuWiki did not.</p><h3 id="4-final-touches">4. Final Touches</h3><p>The last step was to verify everything in Obsidian. I went through my notes to check formatting and that there were no broken links or images. A few minor tweaks were necessary, but the script got me 95% of the way there!</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>It’s been about a year since I did the migration, and using Obsidian is much smoother. I just need to make sure the directory with my notes is properly backed up / synchronized between my devices. Obsidian offers this as a paid feature, but I didn’t want to depend on yet another 3rd party service. I simply use a Git repository to keep my notes.</p><p>For anyone looking to do the same or similar, I hope this post helps you out.</p><p>Here is a small peek of my notes in Obsidian’s beautiful graph view:</p><p><img src="https://kaeruct.github.io/images/screenshots/obsidian-cloud.png" alt="obsidian graph view"/></p></div></div>
