    <h1>Self-hosting your own media considered harmful according to YouTube</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I just received my <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/youtube/issues/12">second community guidelines violation</a> for my video demonstrating the use of LibreELEC on a Raspberry Pi 5, for 4K video playback.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/community-guidelines-strike.jpg" width="700" height="469" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-876a116a-6da8-4656-bf14-863c5958ed02" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;876a116a-6da8-4656-bf14-863c5958ed02&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Community Guidelines Strike - YouTube"/></p>

<p>I purposefully avoid demonstrating any of the tools (with a suffix that rhymes with &#34;car&#34;) that are popularly used to circumvent purchasing movie, TV, and other media content, or any tools that automatically slurp up YouTube content.</p>

<p>In fact, in my own house, for multiple decades, I&#39;ve purchased physical media (CDs, DVDs, and more recently, Blu-Rays), and only have legally-acquired content on my NAS. Streaming services used to be a panacea but are now fragmented and mostly full of garbage—and lots of ads. We just wanted to be able to watch TV shows and movies without hassle (and I&#39;m happy to pay for physical media that I want to watch).</p>

<p>But this morning, as I was finishing up work on a video about a new mini Pi cluster, I got a cheerful email from YouTube saying my video on LibreELEC on the Pi 5 was removed because it promoted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Dangerous or Harmful Content</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never described any of that stuff, only how to self-host your own media library.</p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t my first rodeo—in October last year, I got a <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/youtube/issues/13">strike for showing people how to install Jellyfin</a>!</p>

<p>In <em>that</em> case, I was happy to see my appeal granted within an hour of the strike being placed on the channel. (Nevermind the fact the video had been live for <em>over two years</em> at that point, with nary a problem!)</p>

<p>So I thought, this case will be similar:</p>

<ul>
<li>The video&#39;s been up for over a year, without issue</li>
<li>The video&#39;s had over half a million views</li>
<li>The video doesn&#39;t promote or highlight any tools used to circumvent copyright, get around paid subscriptions, or reproduce any content illegally</li>
</ul>

<p>Slam-dunk, right? Well, not according to whomever reviewed my appeal. Apparently self-hosted open source media library management is harmful.</p>

<p>Who knew open source software could be so <em>subversive</em>?</p>

<h2>The video</h2>

<p>So along that theme, I&#39;ve re-uploaded the video to Internet Archive, free for anyone to download and view at their leisure.</p>

<p><em>Yes, even those rebels running LibreELEC on their Raspberry Pis!</em></p>

<p>Here it is: <a href="https://archive.org/details/libreelec-raspberry-pi-5">LibreELEC on the Raspberry Pi 5 - Internet Archive</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/libreelec-raspberry-pi-5"><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/jeff-geerling-video-libreelec-pi-5.jpg" width="400" height="auto" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-906ddc3d-671e-4d19-9597-36ab08016d49" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;906ddc3d-671e-4d19-9597-36ab08016d49&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="LibreELEC on Pi 5 video thumbnail with play button"/></a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve also uploaded it <a href="https://www.floatplane.com/post/bNx4Mhzqvu">on Floatplane</a>, for subscribers.</p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been slowly uploading my back catalog to <a href="https://www.floatplane.com/channel/JeffGeerling/home">my channel on Floatplane</a>, though not all my content is there yet.</p>

<p>Some in the fediverse ask why I&#39;m not on Peertube. Here&#39;s the problem (and it&#39;s not insurmountable): <em>right now</em>, there&#39;s no easy path towards sustainable content production when the audience for the content is 100x smaller, and the number of patrons/sponsors remains proportionally the same.</p>

<p>I was never able to sustain my open source work based on patronage, and content production is the same—just more expensive to maintain to any standard (each video takes between 10-300 hours to produce, and I have a family to feed, and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/tags/crohns">US health insurance companies to fund</a>).</p>

<p>YouTube was, and still is, a creative anomaly. I&#39;m hugely thankful to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/geerlingguy">Patreon</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://www.floatplane.com/channel/JeffGeerling/home">Floatplane</a> supporters—and I hope to have direct funding fully able to support my work someday. But until that time, YouTube&#39;s AdSense revenue and vast reach is a kind of &#39;golden handcuff.&#39;</p>

<p>The handcuff has been a bit tarnished of late, however, with Google recently adding AI summaries to videos—which <em>seems</em> to indicate maybe <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/google-gemini-s-ai-video-summary-implies-youtube-doesn-t-care-about-content-creators/ar-AA1rMsoy">Gemini is slurping up my content and using it in their AI models</a>?</p>

<p>Maybe the handcuffs are fools-gold, and I just don&#39;t see it yet.</p></div></div>
