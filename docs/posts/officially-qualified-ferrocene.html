<p><strong>It’s official: Ferrocene is ISO 26262 and IEC 61508 qualified!</strong></p>

<p>You can even find the <a href="https://www.tuvsud.com/de-de/dienstleistungen/produktpruefung-und-produktzertifizierung/zertifikatsdatenbank?q=Z10+123030+0001+Rev.+00" target="_blank">certificate in TÜV SÜDs certificate
database</a>.</p>

<p>This means we achieved qualification for the open source Ferrocene toolchain.
Ferrocene 23.06.0, based on Rust 1.68, is now fully usable in safety critical
environments.</p>

<p>Early last month, Ferrocene’s source code <a href="https://github.com/ferrocene/ferrocene">was open sourced on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>After going through a couple rounds of dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s,
TÜV SÜD officially sent over the certification on Monday October 29. This is
the first qualification of a Rust compiler.</p>

<p>With these qualifications, Rust can now be used to develop software for
electronic systems in series production road vehicles. We’ve qualified
Ferrocene for use in systems up to ASIL D – the highest classification of
initial hazard as defined by this standard. This standard provides automakers
with guidelines that make the software being used to develop, produce, operate
and service the automotive sectors safe to use.</p>

<p>Beyond the automotive, Ferrocene can also be used in electronic programmable
systems in the industrial sector. Here the focus is on developing products or
applications that carry out safety functions. Like the automotive
certification, we’ve also gone for the highest level of risk reduction and
qualified it at SIL4.</p>

<p>“Ferrocene is a major achievement both for Rust and safety in automotive,” says
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/floriangilcher/" target="_blank">Florian</a>. “It shows that Rust software can
be used in all critical environments. The process was challenging but matched
what we’ve come to expect from Rust: It enables building correct software at a
much lower cost.”</p>

<p>With this step, we can start rolling out the sales process on Ferrocene.  Our
initial availability is limited to a minimum order of 10 license seats for 12
months, starting at €2.400,00 (€240 each) for the quality managed licenses.</p>

<p>We’ve also got an overview of the reasons for Ferrocene on our YouTube
channel:</p>

<p>And if your organization is interested in purchasing licenses, then <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/contact#ferrocene">reach out
to us</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll be rolling out an individual purchase option at €25 per seat per month or
€240 per seat per year in early 2024.</p>
