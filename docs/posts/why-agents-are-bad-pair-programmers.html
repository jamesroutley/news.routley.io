    <p>LLM agents make bad pairs because <strong>they code faster than humans think</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;ve had a lot of fun <a href="https://justin.searls.co/tubes/2025-04-19-17h46m37s/">using GitHub Copilot&#39;s agent mode in VS Code</a> this month. It&#39;s invigorating to watch it effortlessly write a working method on the first try. It&#39;s a relief when the agent unblocks me by reaching for a framework API I didn&#39;t even know existed. It&#39;s motivating to pair with someone even more tirelessly committed to my goal than I am.</p>
<p>In fact, pairing with top LLMs evokes many memories of pairing with top human programmers.</p>
<p><em>The worst memories.</em></p>
<p>Memories of my pair grabbing the keyboard and—in total and unhelpful silence—hammering out code faster than I could ever hope to read it. Memories of slowly, inevitably becoming disengaged after expending all my mental energy in a futile attempt to keep up. Memories of my pair hitting a roadblock and finally looking to me for help, only to catch me off guard and without a clue as to what had been going on in the preceding minutes, hours, or days. Memories of gradually realizing my pair had been building the <em>wrong thing all along</em> and then suddenly realizing the task now fell to me to remediate a boatload of incidental complexity in order to hit a deadline.</p>
<p>So yes, pairing with an AI agent can be uncannily similar to pairing with an expert programmer.</p>

    <a href="#the-path-forward">The path forward</a>
</h2>
<p>What should we do instead? Two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The same thing I did with human pair programmers who wanted to take the ball and run with it: I let them have it. In a perfect world, pairing might lead to a better solution, but there&#39;s no point in forcing it when both parties aren&#39;t bought in. Instead, I&#39;d break the work down into discrete sub-components for my colleague to build independently. I would then review those pieces as pull requests. Translating that advice to LLM-based tools: <strong>give up on editor-based agentic pairing in favor of asynchronous workflows like GitHub&#39;s new <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/">Coding Agent</a></strong>, whose work you can <em>also</em> review via pull request</li>
<li>Continue to practice pair-programming with your editor, but <strong>throttle down from the semi-autonomous &#34;Agent&#34; mode to the turn-based &#34;Edit&#34; or &#34;Ask&#34; modes</strong>. You&#39;ll go slower, and <em>that&#39;s the point</em>. Also, just like pairing with humans, try to establish a rigorously consistent workflow as opposed to only reaching for AI to troubleshoot. I&#39;ve found that <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html#PingPong">ping-pong pairing</a> with an AI in Edit mode (where the LLM can propose individual edits but you must manually accept them) strikes the best balance between accelerated productivity and continuous quality control</li>
</ol>
<p>Give people a few more months with agents and I think (hope) others will arrive at similar conclusions about their suitability as pair programmers. My advice to the AI tool-makers would be to introduce features to make pairing with an AI agent more qualitatively similar to pairing with a human. Agentic pair programmers are not inherently bad, but their lightning-fast speed has the unintended consequence of undercutting any opportunity for collaborating with us mere mortals. If an agent were designed to type at a slower pace, pause and discuss periodically, and frankly expect more of us as equal partners, that could make for a hell of a product offering.</p>
<p>Just imagining it now, any of these features would make agent-based pairing much more effective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let users set how many lines-per-minute of code—or words-per-minute of prose—the agent outputs</li>
<li>Allow users to pause the agent to ask a clarifying question or push back on its direction without derailing the entire activity or train of thought</li>
<li>Expand beyond the chat metaphor by adding UI primitives that mirror the work to be done. Enable users to pin the current working session to a particular GitHub issue. Integrate a built-in to-do list to tick off before the feature is complete. That sort of thing</li>
<li>Design agents to act with less self-confidence and more self-doubt. They should frequently stop to converse: validate <em>why</em> we&#39;re building this, solicit advice on the best approach, and express concern when we&#39;re going in the wrong direction</li>
<li>Introduce advanced voice chat to better emulate human-to-human pairing, which would allow the user both to keep their eyes on the code (instead of darting back and forth between an editor and a chat sidebar) and to light up the parts of the brain that find mouth-words more engaging than text</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, that&#39;s how I see it from where I&#39;m sitting the morning of Friday, May 30th, 2025. Who knows where these tools will be in a week or month or year, but I&#39;m fairly confident you could find worse advice on meeting this moment.</p>
