                                                                                                                            <!--正文分页开始-->
                                        <p>Chinese company Loongson released its next-generation computer central processing unit (CPU) 3A6000 in Beijing on Tuesday. The CPU is self-designed with key indexes comparable to those of global mainstream products, which observers said marked China&#39;s new breakthrough in the design of domestic CPUs.</p>
<p>The Loongson 3A6000 processor uses a fourth-generation LoongArch, an instruction set architecture (ISA) processor. It is manufactured using 12-nanometer technology and features a quad-core design, with an operating frequency of 2.5GHz. It adopts a domestic instruction system and structure, and it belongs to a new generation of general-purpose processors that are self-developed and technologically controllable.</p>
<p>The Loongson 3A6000 is comparable to the Intel Core i3-10100 and AMD Ryzen 3 3100 CPUs in certain key functions, according to tech website Wccf tech.</p>
<p>&#34;The release shows that domestic CPUs have reached a new height in self-sufficiency and performance. It also demonstrates that China is capable of producing first-class products based on a proprietary CPU structure,&#34; Shi Huikang, an official of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, told media outlets.</p>
<p>Multiple Chinese computer brands, including Lenovo, Tongfang, Ipason, Founder and Hair, have launched new computer series based on the Loongson 3A6000 processor.</p>
<p>Loongson announced on Tuesday broader cooperation with 10 companies by authorizing the licensing of its Loongson CPU core intellectual property and LoongArch, which aims to build a LoongArch ecosystem with its partners, according to media reports.</p>

<p>Amid tech decoupling sought by certain Western countries, there are growing demands for China&#39;s computer industry to seek new solutions. After years of development, Loongson&#39;s CPUs can fit the industry&#39;s needs of supply chain security and performance, Ma Jihua, a telecom analyst at Beijing Daojing Consultant Co, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Loongson&#39;s development in the chip industry depends on two major factors - whether the company can have access to technologies and manufacturing equipment, and whether it can find enough partners in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>If the computer industry buys enough of Loongson&#39;s products, it can cut the cost of the chip and generate demand for future upgrades, Ma said.</p>
<p>China has made tremendous efforts to achieving tech self-sufficiency in the chip sector amid Western blockades. The release of the CPU3A6000 shows the speed at which Chinese companies have been catching up with foreign peers.</p>
<p>The release of the Huawei Mate 60 series on August 30 showed that the high-end smartphone series adopted Kirin 9000S chips, a major breakthrough of the company&#39;s development in smartphones.</p>
<p>On November 15, Chinese GPU chip company Moore Threads completed a new round of financing, reportedly in the range of 2-2.5 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The company has released several products, including consumer graphics cards MTT S80 and MTT S70, which are mainly used in the entertainment and creative fields.</p>                                                                                    <!--正文分页结束-->
