    <h1>↗ Praise for a humble wiki page on Linux audio</h1>

    <p>Lately I’ve been doing some experimentation with the Clojure audio environment <a href="https://overtone.github.io/">Overtone</a>. As I was reading through the documentation I stumbled upon this banger of a wiki page: <a href="https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/Linux-Audio-Primer">Linux Audio Primer</a>. If you’ve ever been curious about how Linux audio works but have been afraid of untangling a rat’s nest of complexity, this is the explanation for you.</p>

<p>I really appreciated how it describes the Linux audio stack through a story of how we ended up where we are today. It explains the <em>people</em> that built various components in the stack and the context of how they were designed and implemented.</p>

<p>As somebody who used Apple hardware up until a year ago, I mostly knew subcomponents of my computer as opaque boxes that were periodically announced or retired during Apple’s developer conferences. Occasionally engineers would come forward a decade later and explain some of the internal politicking that lead to an individual decision, but this was more the exception than the norm. In contrast, components of a Linux system offer much more transparency. The people and organizations building them have to operate much more publicly, making the history transparent by default. That’s an incredibly cool aspect of an operating system that I hadn’t much thought about until now.</p>

<p>Using Linux as my primary operating system comes with its ups and downs, but this seemingly unrelated technical document has given me a realization of how cool it is that I can know these stories behind the design of a device I look at (and listen to!) for a sizable chunk of my day.</p>
