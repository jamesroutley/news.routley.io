    <h1>Ask HN: Have you ever inherited a code base you thought was well done?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I see and hear a lot of complaints around inheriting code bases that are less than stellar. If anyone has, I&#39;d love to hear about cases where you inherited a &#34;good&#34; code base, whatever that may mean: awesome test coverage, good documentation, solid organization, consistent styling/formatting, abundant best practices, whatever!</td></div></div>
