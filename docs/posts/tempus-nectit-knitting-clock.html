<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="http://kylerank.in/tempus_nectit/IMG_20230318_122503.jpg"><img src="http://kylerank.in/tempus_nectit/IMG_20230318_122503s.jpg" alt="Tempus Nectit knitting clock mounted on the wall"/></a></p><p>One of the benefits of learning how to make things, is that you sometimes come across something and think not only &#34;I want that!&#34; but also &#34;and I think I might be able to make it!&#34; Plus sometimes things you want can&#39;t be bought in a store. About two months ago <a href="https://hackaday.com">Hackaday</a> featured a <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/01/23/knitting-clock-makes-you-a-scarf-for-next-year/">knitting clock</a> designed by Siren Elise Wilhelmsen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sirenelisewilhelmsen.com/#365knittingclock">Wilhelmsen&#39;s clock</a> was designed as an art project that showed the passage of time by knitting a stitch every half hour, a row every day. At the end of a year the machine would drop a 365-row scarf from the bottom. This project intrigued me as it is a kind of cross-section of many of my interests: electronics, clocks and knitting. I had even recently acquired a flatbed knitting machine and was starting to learn how to make shawls and other clothing with it. This seemed like such a cool thing to have on my wall. I wanted one.</p>

<p><img src="http://kylerank.in/tempus_nectit/Wilhelmsen_365_4_web.jpg" alt="Siren Elise Wilhelmsen&#39;s knitting clock, the inspiration for Tempus Nectit"/></p><p>While it appeared you could commission one of Wilhelmsen&#39;s clocks from her site, no price was listed and &#34;if you have to ask you can&#39;t afford it.&#34; Considering this was an art project with installations in hotels among other places, I figured it was out of reach regardless. Unfortunately the site didn&#39;t go into any details on how the clock was made, and only featured a short artistic video showing it in operation.</p>

<h3>&#34;You Should Make One!&#34;</h3>

<p>The day the post showed up on Hackaday, I actually shared it with my wife saying how cool it was and how I wanted one. Her response? &#34;You should make one!&#34; While I had already entertained the idea before that, her encouragement pushed me over the edge. After all, even without any instructions, if you break down what this clock is into its individual components, it isn&#39;t all that complicated. You need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 48-hook circular knitting machine</li>
<li>A stepper motor attached to the hand crank</li>
<li>Electronics to control the stepper motor</li>
<li>Software to turn the motor one stitch every 30 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>I had a stepper motor from an old 3D printer, a Raspberry Pi, and willingness to learn new skills. I needed a knitting machine, some electronics components, and a lot of new skills. To complete this project I ultimately needed to learn how to control stepper motors electronically, expand my rudimentary Python skills, and learn 3D modeling.</p>

<p>I have seen a number of wall clocks that feature the Latin expression <em>Tempus Fugit</em> or &#34;time flies&#34; and so I decided to name my project <em>Tempus Nectit</em> or the closest approximation I could find for &#34;time knits.&#34;</p>
