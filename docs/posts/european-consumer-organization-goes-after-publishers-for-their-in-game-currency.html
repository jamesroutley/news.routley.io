    <h1>European Consumer Organization goes after publishers for their in-game currency</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>European Consumer Organization (BEUC) has called on the European Commission to deal with various game publishers, that the BEUC claim are breaching EU consumer protection laws.</p>
<p>The action named &#34;<a href="https://www.beuc.eu/game-over" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game OVER</a>&#34;, was announced September 12th, in partnership with member organisations from 17 countries. Taking aim at Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Mojang Studios, Roblox Corporation, Supercell and Ubisoft.</p>
<p>What&#39;s the issue then? They identified these areas of concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumers cannot see the real cost of digital items, leading to overspending:</strong> the lack of price transparency of premium in-game currencies and the need to buy extra currency in bundles pushes consumers to spend more. </li>
<li><strong>Companies’ claims that gamers prefer in-game premium currencies are wrong. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Consumers are often denied their rights when using premium in-game currencie</strong>s, tied to unfair terms favouring game developers. </li>
<li><strong>Children are even more vulnerable to these manipulative tactics</strong>. Data shows that children in Europe are spending on average €39 per month on in-game purchases. While they are among the ones playing the most, they have limited financial literacy and are easily swayed by virtual currencies. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/consumer-groups-denounce-video-games-manipulative-spending-tactics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>: Agustín Reyna, Director General of BEUC, commented:</p>
<p>&#34;The online world brings new challenges for consumer protection, and it shouldn’t be a place where companies bend the rules to increase profits. BEUC’s members have identified numerous cases where gamers are misled into spending money. Regulators must act, making it clear that even though the gaming world is virtual, it still needs to abide by real-world rules.”</p>
<p>“Gamers shouldn’t need to rely on a calculator anytime they want to make an informed decision on how much they want to spend. The money they spend should be displayed in real money and deceptive practices must be stopped.”</p>
<p>“Today, premium in-game currencies are purposefully tricking consumers and take a big toll on children. Companies are well aware of children’s vulnerability and use tricks to lure younger consumers into spending more.”</p>
<p>Video Games Europe, a trade body that represents 19 European and international video game companies and 13 national trade associations put out their own <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/video-games-europe-statement-on-in-game-currencies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> statement on it that notes:</p>
<p>&#34;The purchase of in-game currencies is a well-established practice, and well understood by players. Our members always respect European consumer laws in how they offer these purchases.</p>
<p>Our industry offers a wide range of games that enable players to access a huge variety of genres and innovative new experiences across different services. Players can experience entire games without spending any money, giving them the opportunity to try games without any upfront cost or commitment.</p>
<p>Video Games Europe and its members support and promote fair and transparent principles for purchases of in-game content, including for in-game currency. The PEGI Code of Conduct requires developers to ensure that the real-world cost is clear and unambiguous at the point of purchase of the in-game currency.&#34;</p>
<p>This is going to be an interesting fight. </p>
