    <h1>An Update on Leap Seconds</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pagefind-body="">
  <p>It has been a couple of years since <a href="https://dotat.at/@/2020-11-13-leap-second-hiatus.html">my previous blog post about leap
seconds</a>, though I have been tweeting on the topic fairly
frequently: see <a href="https://dotat.at/writing/time.html">my page on date, time, and leap seconds</a> for an
index of threads. But Twitter now seems a lot less likely to stick
around, so I’ll aim to collect more of my thinking-out-loud here on my
blog.</p>
<h2 id="falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-leap-seconds">falsehoods programmers believe about leap seconds</h2>
<p><a href="https://dotat.at/writing/time.html">
<img src="https://dotat.at/graphics/leapclock.png" width="42%"/>
</a></p><p>When programmers discuss the problems caused by leap seconds, they
usually agree that the solution is to “just” keep time in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time">TAI</a>, and
apply leap second adjustments at the outer layers of the system, in a
similar manner to <a href="https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html">time zones</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, this simplification does not work, because there’s a mess of
historical accidents and social and technical requirements that do not
always align as we might wish.</p>
<h2 id="reality-bites">reality bites</h2>
<p>Fundamentally, computer systems need to work with civil time (i.e.
UTC) because it is baked into a huge number of standards: file
formats, protocols (including <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5905#page-14">NTP</a>), APIs (including <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_16">POSIX</a>),
etc. usw. It’s impossible to sweep all that away by saying “just use
TAI”: even the kernel has to support things like filesystem timestamps
in UTC, and it can’t deprecate POSIX <code>time_t</code> in APIs without a huge
ABI break.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_16">POSIX <code>time_t</code></a> is often criticised as being “wrong” for
ignoring leap seconds. (NTP ignores leap seconds in the same manner,
but is hardly ever criticized for it.) However, calendaring
applications (and others that deal with times in the future) <em>have to</em>
ignore leap seconds so that they can schedule events more than 6
months ahead, when the difference TAI-UTC is unknown. So ignoring leap
seconds is not always wrong.</p>
<h2 id="rubbery-indiscretions">rubbery indiscretions</h2>
<p>UTC has always been an awkward compromise between atomic time and mean
solar time.</p>
<p>In the 1960s UTC kept in sync with the earth using a combination of
small steps and rate adjustments (aka “rubber seconds”). This was
problematic for radio broadcast time signals, because they keep a
fixed relationship between the time signals and their carrier’s phase
and frequency. So rate changes required retuning the transmitters.</p>
<p>As I understand it, <a href="https://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat">UTC in the 1960s</a> was mostly co-ordinated
between the USA and UK; other countries had different ways of bridging
between TAI and UT, such as “stepped atomic time”, which had a fixed
rate with relatively frequent 100ms or 200ms jumps.</p>
<h2 id="atomic-quantum">atomic quantum</h2>
<p>Since the 1930s when we first developed clocks that run more regularly
than the earth, there had been a gradual technocratic exploration and
development of solutions for coping with the difference between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time">UT</a>
(aka mean solar time, aka civil time) and our best most regular time
scales (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris_Time">ET</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Time">TT</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time">TAI</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>This was suddenly put to a stop when Germany made a law implementing
the new atomic definition of the SI second decided at the <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cg/cgpm/13-1967/resolution-1">1967
CGPM</a>. The effect of this law was to forbid rubber seconds and
stepped atomic time: adjustments had to be a whole number of SI atomic
seconds. At the same time, celestial navigation was still important,
so civil time needed to stay close to UT.</p>
<h2 id="act-in-haste">act in haste</h2>
<p>Leap seconds were the dirty compromise solution. I say “dirty” because
they were cooked up in back-room deals without the kind of open discussion
and consultation you would expect for something so important. And it seems
no-one was really happy with the compromise, but no-one could come up with
a better solution that could be implemented in an acceptable timeframe.</p>
<p>So that’s how things have remained for the last 50 years. UTC isn’t a
carefully engineered solution that considers how best to satisfy the
accuracy requirements of different users of time and frequency. It’s an
ugly hack.</p>
<h2 id="regret-at-leisure">regret at leisure</h2>
<p>For the last 20ish years, the people responsible for implementing TAI
and UTC have been trying to get rid of leap seconds. It isn’t just
because, or even mainly because software is bad and programmers are
too stupid to get UTC right. The impetus comes from people who run
systems that <em>have to</em> get UTC right, and they think it is much more
painful than necessary.</p>
<h2 id="a-zoo-of-committees">a zoo of committees</h2>
<p>The governance around UTC is complicated. Formally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-R">ITU-R</a> is
responsible for the specification <a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-TF.460/">TF.460</a>, and amendments need to
be approved by the <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/conferences/wrc/">World Radiocommunication Conference</a> which is
an international treaty conference that happens every 3 or 4 years.</p>
<p>The practical implementation of UTC is the responsibility of the
<a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/time-metrology">BIPM</a> and the <a href="https://webtai.bipm.org/database/showlab.html">national time laboratories</a> that
contribute their measurements. The BIPM and its managing committee the
<a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/ci/cipm">CIPM</a> implement the decisions of the <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cg/cgpm">CGPM</a>, another quadrennial
international treaty conference. Recommendations specifically about
time and frequency are prepared by the <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cc/cctf/">CCTF</a>, which liaises with
the ITU-R, IAU, and other committees.</p>
<p>The scheduling of leap seconds is the responsibility of the
<a href="https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Organization/ProductCentres/EarthOrientationCentre/eoc.html">IERS</a>, which has a <a href="https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Organization/DirectingBoard/IERSDirectingBoard.html">governing board</a> that
includes <a href="https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Organization/About/RelationOrganizations/RelationOrganizations.html">representatives</a> from the International
Astronomical Union (IAU), the International Union of Geodesy and
Geophysics (IUGG), and the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS).</p>
<h2 id="a-timeline">a timeline</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.itu.int/pub/R-ACT-WRC.9-2012">WRC 2012</a> instructed the
ITU-R to examine the future of UTC and leap seconds (resolution 653).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.itu.int/pub/R-ACT-WRC.12-2015">WRC 2015</a> decided not to
make a change, but indicated that work should continue in co-operation
with the CIPM, and report back at WRC 2023 (resolution 655).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cg/cgpm/26-2018">CGPM 2018</a>
approved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_SI">new SI</a>, the
completion of a huge project; they also found time to formally <em>not</em>
decide about UTC, but that work should continue (resolution 2).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cc/cctf/23-2022">CCTF 2022</a>
prepared a “Draft Resolution D” to be presented at the CGPM, with some
informative explanatory notes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/cgpm-2022">CGPM 2022</a> approved <del>draft D</del>
resolution 4, which instructs the CIPM to consult with the ITU on
relaxing the 0.9s limit on UT1-UTC, so that there will be no leap
seconds for at least a century after 2035, subject to approval at CGPM
2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.itu.int/wrc-23/">WRC 2023</a> should receive a report on the
future of leap seconds (per WRC 2015 resolution 655) but as far as I
can tell it isn’t on the agenda. I guess this means that the WRC will
not make a decision about UTC and work will continue?</p>
<p>CGPM 2026 will make the final decision on whether the CCTF 2022 plan
will go ahead.</p>
<h2 id="practical-consequences">practical consequences</h2>
<p>At the moment, if you need a rough idea of earth angle (i.e. mean
solar time, i.e. UT1), you can use UTC, which is accurate to within
+/- 0.9s, or 0.46 km at the equator. TF.460 also specifies that time
signals should broadcast DUT1 accurate to 0.1s, i.e. 46m at the
equator. (DUT1 is the difference between UTC and UT1.)</p>
<p>If leap seconds are abolished, then people who need earth angle to
that level of precision (a few hundred metres) will need to start
adding DUT1 to the time on their clocks, or get their earth angle
measurements elsewhere.</p>
<p>Abolishing leap seconds will require changes to the specification of radio
signals (TF.460 and the various national time signals) to allow for larger
values of DUT1. The new-ish GPS L5 signals allow DUT1 as large as +/-
127 seconds (see <a href="https://www.gps.gov/technical/icwg/">IS-GPS-705</a> section 20.3.3.5.1).</p>
<h2 id="what-about-tai-">what about TAI?</h2>
<p>Abolishing leap seconds will be helpful for users that have very tight
accuracy requirements. UTC is the <em>only</em> timescale that is provided by
national laboratories in metrologically traceable manner, i.e. in a
way that provides real-time access, and allows users to demonstrate
exactly how accurate their timekeeping is.</p>
<p>TAI is not directly traceable in the same way: it is only a “paper”
clock, published monthly in arrears in <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/time-ftp/circular-t">Circular T</a> as a table of
corrections to the various national timescales. (See the <a href="https://webtai.bipm.org/ftp/pub/tai/other-products/notes/explanatory_supplement_v0.6.pdf">explanatory
supplement</a> for more details).</p>
<p>The effect of this is that users who require high-accuracy uniformity
and traceability have to implement leap seconds to recover a uniform
timescale from UTC - not the other way round as the programmers’
falsehood would have it.</p>
<h2 id="another-timeline">another timeline</h2>
<p>Concurrent with all this <em>thrilling</em> committee activity, the <a href="https://dotat.at/@/2020-11-13-leap-second-hiatus.html">leap
second hiatus</a> continues. Below is a chart of the simple
linear projection of the length of day from <a href="https://maia.usno.navy.mil/products/bulletin-a">IERS Bulletin A</a>.</p>
<p>The blue line has been below zero since the end of 2020, indicating
that the earth has been spinning faster than <code>24*60*60</code> seconds. The
line has been heading down (the earth speeding up) determinedly since
mid-2016, and though it has levelled off a bit in the last couple of
years, the earth is not clearly slowing down again.</p>
<p>My trivial guesstimate from this chart is that there will be a
negative leap second in about five years, i.e. after CGPM 2026, but
before the planned abolition of leap seconds in 2035.</p>
<p>But don’t listen to me! Demetrios Matsakis has made some projections
based on a more well-informed and expertly constructed model, which
suggests <a href="https://www.gps.gov/cgsic/meetings/2022/matsakis.pdf">we might not have a negative leap second</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2022-12-04-lod.png" alt="chart of length of day, 2016-2022" width="100%"/></p>
<h2 id="leap-minute-leap-hour-">leap minute? leap hour?</h2>
<p>In the long term, it’s likely that the bounds on DUT1 will be relaxed
again in 100 years time, because a leap minute will be far too
difficult. <a href="https://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/dutc.html">In the even longer term</a>, we expect the earth to
return to its trend of slowing down due to tidal forces from the moon.</p>
<p>Eventually, in 1000 years or so, DUT1 will grow to an hour, by which time
it will be obvious that noon is not as close to 12:00 as it used to be.
But, if we continue to use leap seconds as currently specified, in 1000
years or so we will need several leap seconds per year, and it will be
difficult to keep DUT1 within its +/- 0.9 second bounds.</p>
<p>Maybe there will be a breakthrough in modelling and predicting the
earth’s speed of rotation, in which case there could be a more
fundamental reassessment of how every-day civil time relates to
precise atomic time.</p>
<h2 id="opinion">opinion</h2>
<p>Whichever way, with or without leap seconds, our current timescales are
clearly not the be all and end all forever amen, so I think it makes sense
that they should be designed for practical utility. UTC is our timescale
for both high precision metrology and every-day purposes; there are other
better ways to get earth angle, so UTC doesn’t need to (try to, badly) do
that job as well.</p>
