    <h1>AI has had zero effect on jobs so far, says Yale study</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Yale researchers say that despite the anxiety about AI taking people&#39;s jobs, there&#39;s very little evidence of it actually happening.</p>
<p>Economists with Yale&#39;s Budget Lab, a non-partisan policy research group, took a look at how US employment has changed since the November 2022 debut of ChatGPT and the sequent release of other generative AI models.</p>
<p>They saw nothing to be alarmed about.</p>

    

<p>&#34;Overall, our metrics indicate that the broader labor market has not experienced a discernible disruption since ChatGPT’s release 33 months ago, undercutting fears that AI automation is currently eroding the demand for cognitive labor across the economy,&#34; said Martha Gimbel, Molly Kinder, Joshua Kendall, and Maddie Lee in a <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/evaluating-impact-ai-labor-market-current-state-affairs">report summary</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>The leaders of AI companies have been stoking those fears – an effective way to get meetings with lawmakers. In May, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/29/anthropic_ceo_ai_job_threat/">expressed concern</a> that within five years, AI could cut the number of entry-level white collar jobs in half. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/sam-altman-predicts-ai-cause-102800375.html">has made similar pronouncements</a>.</p>
<p>And major companies conducting layoffs like <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/02/ibm_ai_back_office_jobs/">IBM</a> and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/02/salesforce_4000_jobs_ai/">Salesforce</a> have held themselves up as examples of that narrative, though their employee culls may be more focused on outsourcing than automation. Smaller companies like Fiverr have also <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/16/fiverr_ai_layoff/">cited AI amid layoffs</a>.</p>

        

<p>AI cheerleader Microsoft recently added fuel to the fire with <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/29/microsoft_boffins_jobs_impacted_ai/">a report on jobs most likely to be affected by AI</a>, only to later distance itself from the blaze by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/applicability-vs-job-displacement-further-notes-on-our-recent-research-on-ai-and-occupations/">noting</a>, &#34;our study does not draw any conclusions about jobs being eliminated.&#34;</p>

</ul>
<p>In Microsoft&#39;s own case, the culls appear to be a way to reduce expenses and mollify investors following its <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/25/microsoft_ceo_job_cuts/">massive capital expenditures on data centers</a> that fuel its AI ambitions.</p>
<p>The Yale researchers&#39; nothingburger result has precedent. In 2023, a study by the United Nations International Labour Organization (ILO) <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/23/ilo_ai_jobs_impact_study/">concluded</a> that generative AI would probably not replace most workers.</p>
<p>A study of Danish workers published in April determined that generative AI <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/29/generative_ai_no_effect_jobs_wages/">had no material impact on wages or jobs</a>. Another such <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33509">study</a> published in February found &#34;overall employment effects are modest, as reduced demand in exposed occupations is offset by productivity-driven increases in labor demand at AI-adopting firms.&#34;</p>
<p>There is some contradictory data. A recent Stanford Digital Economy Lab study <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/ai_hurts_recent_college_grads_jobs/">claims</a> that recent college graduates in occupations most exposed to AI have seen a 13 percent relative decline in employment compared to occupations more insulated from AI.</p>

        

<p>But the consensus appears to be that generative AI has not had a meaningful impact on the labor market so far. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/gartner_ai_agents/">Enterprise skepticism of the technology</a> may be one reason for that. ®</p>
