We made it easier to file taxes, get veterans&#39; benefits, and apply for financial aid. During times of crisis, we helped refugees navigate immigration processes, helped everyone find vaccines, and helped parents find baby formula.</p><p>Along the way, we made government websites easier to use while protecting the integrity of your personal information.</p><p>If they really wanted to know how to use technology to build a more efficient country, they would ask us.</p><p>But they haven&#39;t. They are destroyers.</p><p>We are the builders.</p><h2>Our mission</h2><p>We don&#39;t work for DOGE. We have always worked for you.</p><p>Here, you&#39;ll find stories from real government employees: How we save you time and money, how we protect your personal information, and how DOGE&#39;s dangerous dismantling of government technology puts you at risk.</p></div></div></div></div>
