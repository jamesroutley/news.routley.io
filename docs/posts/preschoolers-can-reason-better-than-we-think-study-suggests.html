																																	<p>To find out, Sarah Dufour, an assistant professor in the didactics department of the Faculty of Education at Université de Montréal, conducted a study in which children were given toy groceries and asked to organize the food on shelves.</p>
<p>Dufour observed how the children, aged three to five, developed their strategies and analyzed the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/mathematical+operations/" rel="tag">mathematical operations</a> they used to categorize everyday objects.</p>
<p>To study the processes underlying <a href="https://phys.org/tags/categorization/" rel="tag">categorization</a>, Dufour observed the children in two 30-minute sessions and noted how they sorted, classified and grouped objects.</p>
<h2>Categorization in theory</h2>
<p>&#34;Categorizing means organizing objects according to one or more criteria,&#34; Dufour explained. &#34;According to the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+literature/" rel="tag">scientific literature</a>, objects can be categorized by sorting, classifying or grouping them. We wanted to see how children apply these processes in practice.&#34;</p>
<p>Sorting means arranging objects in order; for example, lining up pencils from lightest to darkest. Classifying means separating objects based on a predefined criterion, such as putting the pencils in bins by color. Grouping means forming sets based on a common characteristic defined by the children themselves.</p>
<p>&#34;For example, a child might notice that three pencils in their collection are blue and put them together, even if they are different shades of blue, justifying their choice by the similar color,&#34; Dufour said.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>Categorization in practice</h2>
<p>To capture the children&#39;s reasoning in action, Dufour used a qualitative and interpretive approach. &#34;My aim was to observe how these processes emerge and connect spontaneously, without giving strict instructions,&#34; she said.</p>
<p>&#34;That&#39;s why I used toys rather than, say, abstract geometric shapes. We know children can manipulate basic figures such as circles, squares and triangles at an early age, but I wanted to go further and explore their thinking to understand how they construct their categorizations.&#34;</p>
<p>She used grocery-store-themed toys that could be categorized in multiple ways—small boxes, fruits, vegetables and so on.</p>
<p>Research has shown that children are capable of complex reasoning, even creating subgroups within their categories.</p>
<p>&#34;This principle of class inclusion reflects advanced thinking,&#34; Dufour said. &#34;But although primary school students are able to classify objects, they often have difficulty explaining their approach and describing the criteria they used.&#34;</p>
<p>In her study, Dufour set out to show that children&#39;s reasoning can be accessed if they are given the right support.</p>
<p>&#34;Some of the children alternated between grouping and classifying,&#34; she reported. &#34;When they noticed an inconsistency, they spontaneously adjusted their groupings based on a new attribute.&#34;</p>
<h2>Beyond the binary</h2>
<p>The study showed that young children can go beyond simple binary classification, which divides objects into two categories: those with an attribute and those without.</p>
<p>&#34;We often think that children start categorizing by opposing two groups: a red crayon goes in one category and all the others in the other,&#34; Dufour said.</p>
<p>&#34;But our study shows that they are capable of developing more complex categorizations and creating several groups based on various criteria.&#34;</p>
<p>These findings open up new pedagogical possibilities and suggest that, with appropriate support, children can develop sophisticated mathematical reasoning from an early age, she added.</p>
