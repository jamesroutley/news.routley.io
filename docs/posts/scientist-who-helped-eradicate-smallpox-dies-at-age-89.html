Before the disease was officially eradicated in 1980, it killed around one in three people who were infected. According to the CDC, there have been no new smallpox cases <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/about/index.html">since 1977</a>.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“If you look at the simple metric of who has saved the most lives, he is right up there with the pantheon,” said former CDC director Tom Frieden <a href="https://apnews.com/article/william-foege-smallpox-cdc-73770ffe382e48829a87fee0b364a3d1">to the Associated Press</a>. “Smallpox eradication has prevented hundreds of millions of deaths.”</p><hr/><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you&#39;re enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/">subscribing</a>.

Kennedy, Jr. In a <i>New York Times </i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/01/opinion/cdc-leaders-kennedy.html">op-ed</a>, they wrote that the top health official’s tenure was “unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In <a href="https://www.taskforce.org/bill-foege-tribute/">a statement</a>, Task Force for Global Health CEO Patrick O’Carroll remembered Foege as an “inspirational” figure, both for early-career public health workers and veterans of the field. “Whenever he spoke, his vision and compassion would reawaken the optimism that prompted us to choose this field, and re-energize our efforts to make this world a better place,” O’Carroll said.</p></div><section><h2>It’s Time to Stand Up for Science</h2><p>If you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support.<!-- --> <span>Scientific American</span> has served as an advocate for science and industry for 180 years, and right now may be the most critical moment in that two-century history.</p><p>I’ve been a <span>Scientific American</span> <!-- -->subscriber since I was 12 years old, and it helped shape the way I look at the world.<!-- --> <span>SciAm </span>always educates and delights me, and inspires a sense of awe for our vast, beautiful universe.
