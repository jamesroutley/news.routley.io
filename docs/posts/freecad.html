        <h3>Freedom to build what you want</h3>
        <p>
          FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to
          design real-life objects of any size. Parametric modeling allows you
          to easily modify your design by going back into your model history
          and changing its parameters.        </p>

        <h3>Create 3D from 2D &amp; back</h3>
        <p>
          FreeCAD allows you to sketch geometry constrained 2D shapes and use
          them as a base to build other objects. It contains many components
          to adjust dimensions or extract design details from 3D models to
          create high quality production ready drawings.        </p>

          FreeCAD is a multiplatform (Windows, Mac and Linux), highly
          customizable and extensible software. It reads and writes to many
          open file formats such as STEP, IGES, STL, SVG, DXF, OBJ, IFC, DAE
          and many others, making it possible to seamlessly integrate it into
          your workflow.        </p>
