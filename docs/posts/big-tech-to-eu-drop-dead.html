    <div><div><div><p><span data-contrast="none">The European Union’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) is a complex, many-legged beast, but at root, it is a regulation that aims to make it easier for the public to control the technology they use and rely on. </span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">One DMA rule forces </span><span>the powerful “gatekeeper” </span><span data-contrast="none">tech companies to allow third-party app stores. That means that you, the owner of a device, can decide who you trust to provide you with software for it. </span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another rule requires those tech gatekeepers to offer interoperable gateways that other platforms can plug into - so you can quit using a chat client, switch to a rival, and still connect with the people you left behind (similar measures may come to social media in the future).</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">There’s a rule banning “self-preferencing.” That’s when platforms push their often inferior, in-house products and hide superior products made by their rivals.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">And perhaps best of all, there’s a privacy rule, reinforcing the eight-year-old General Data Protection Regulation, a strong</span><span>,</span><span data-contrast="none"> privacy law that has been flouted</span><span> </span><span data-contrast="none"> for too long, </span><i><span data-contrast="none">especially </span></i><span data-contrast="none">by the largest tech giants.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In other words, the DMA is meant to push us toward a world where you decide which software runs on your devices,</span><span> </span><span data-contrast="none"> where it’s easy to find the best products and services, where you can leave a platform for a better one without forfeiting your social relationships</span> <span data-contrast="none">,</span> <span data-contrast="none">and where you can do all of this without getting spied on.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span>If it </span><span>works,</span> <span data-contrast="none">this will get dangerously close to </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/how-to-fix-the-internet-podcast"><span data-contrast="none">better future</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> we’ve spent the past thirty years fighting for.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">There’s just one wrinkle: the Big Tech companies don’t want that future, and they’re trying their damndest to strangle it in its cradle.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"></span></p>

<p><span data-ccp-props="0}"> Right from the start, it was obvious that the tech giants were going to war against the DMA, and the freedom it promised to their users. Take Apple, whose tight control over which software its customers can install was a major concern of the DMA from its inception.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> <br/></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Apple didn’t invent the idea of a “curated computer” that could only run software that was blessed by its manufacturer, but they certainly perfected it. iOS devices will refuse to run software unless it comes from Apple’s App Store, and that control over Apple’s customers means that Apple can exert tremendous control over app vendors, too.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}"> Apple charges app vendors a whopping 30 percent commission on most transactions, both the initial price of the app and everything you buy from it thereafter. This is a remarkably high transaction fee —compare it to the credit-card sector, itself the subject of sharp criticism for its high </span><i><span data-contrast="none">3-5</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> percent fees. To maintain those high commissions, Apple also restricts its vendors from informing their customers about the existence of other ways of paying (say, via their website) and at various times has also banned its vendors from offering discounts to customers who complete their purchases without using the app. </span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">Apple is adamant that it needs this control to keep its customers safe, but </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/letter-bruce-schneier-senate-judiciary-regarding-app-store-security"><span data-contrast="none">in theory</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> and </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-analytics-tracking-even-when-off-app-store-1849757558"><span data-contrast="none">in practice</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, Apple has shown that </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/letter-bruce-schneier-senate-judiciary-regarding-app-store-security"><span data-contrast="none">it can protect you without maintaining this degree of control</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, and that </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-analytics-tracking-even-when-off-app-store-1849757558"><span data-contrast="none">it uses this control to </span><i><span data-contrast="none">take away</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> your security when it serves the company’s profits to do so</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">Apple </span><a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/apple/marketcap/"><span data-contrast="none">is worth between two and three trillion dollars</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. Investors prize Apple’s stock in large part due to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/opinion/apple-google-app-monopoly.html"><span data-contrast="none">the tens of billions of dollars it extracts from other businesses</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> that want to reach its customers.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The DMA is aimed squarely at these practices. It requires the largest app store companies to grant their customers the freedom to choose other app stores. Companies like Apple were given over a year to prepare for the DMA, and were told to produce compliance plans by March of this year.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">But </span><a href="https://proton.me/blog/apple-dma-compliance-plan-trap"><span data-contrast="none">Apple’s compliance plan falls </span><i><span data-contrast="none">very</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> short of the mark</span></a><span data-contrast="none">: between a blizzard of confusing junk fees (like the €0.50 per use “Core Technology Fee” that the most popular apps will have to pay Apple even if their apps are sold through a rival store) and onerous conditions (app makers who try </span><span>to sell through </span><span data-contrast="none">a rival app store </span><span>are </span><span>have their offerings </span><span data-contrast="none">removed from Apple’s store, and are permanently </span><span> banned </span><span data-contrast="none">from it), the plan in no way satisfies the EU’s goal of fostering competition in app stores.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">That’s just scratching the surface of Apple’s absurd proposal: Apple’s customers will have to successfully navigate a maze of deeply buried settings just to try another app store (</span><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/01/altstore-iphone-apps-patreon-eu/"><span data-contrast="none">and there’s some pretty cool-sounding app stores in the wings</span></a><span data-contrast="none">!), and </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/7/24093437/apple-iphone-third-party-app-store-dma-eu"><span data-contrast="none">Apple will disable all your third-party apps if you take your phone out of the EU for 30 days</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Apple appears to be playing a high-stakes game of chicken with EU regulators, effectively saying, “Yes, you have 500 million citizens, but we have three trillion dollars, so why should we listen to you?” Apple inaugurated this performance of noncompliance by banning Epic, the company most closely associated with the EU’s decision to require third party app stores, from operating an app store and terminating its developer account (</span><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account"><span data-contrast="none">Epic’s account was later reinstated</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> after the EU registered its disapproval).</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It’s not just Apple, of course. </span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The DMA includes new enforcement tools to finally apply the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) to US tech giants. The GDPR is Europe’s landmark privacy law, but in the eight years since its passage, Europeans have struggled to use it to reform the terrible privacy practices of the largest tech companies.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Meta is one of the worst on privacy, and no wonder: its entire business is grounded in the nonconsensual extraction and mining of billions of dollars’ worth of private information from billions of people all over the world. The GDPR should be requiring Meta to actually secure our willing, informed (and revocable) consent to carry on all this surveillance, and there’s </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html"><span data-contrast="none">good evidence that more than 95 percent of us would block Facebook spying if we could</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Meta’s answer to this is a “</span><a href="https://noyb.eu/en/pay-or-okay-1500-eu-year-your-online-privacy"><span data-contrast="none">Pay or Okay</span></a><span data-contrast="none">” system, in which users who do not consent to Meta’s surveillance will have to pay to use the service, or be blocked from it. Unfortunately for Meta, this is prohibited (privacy is not a luxury good that only the wealthiest should be afforded). </span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Just like Apple, Meta is behaving as though the DMA permits it to carry on its worst behavior, with minor cosmetic tweaks around the margins. Just like Apple, Meta is daring the EU to enforce its democratically enacted laws, implicitly promising to pit its billions against Europe’s institutions to preserve its right to spy on us.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">These are high-stakes clashes. </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6fb1602d-a08b-4a8c-bac0-047b7d64aba5"><span data-contrast="none">As the tech sector grew more concentrated, it also grew less accountable</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, able to substitute lock-in and regulatory capture for making good products and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/who-has-your-back-2019"><span data-contrast="none">having their users’ backs</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. Tech has found new ways to compromise our </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy"><span data-contrast="none">privacy rights</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, our </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/tech-rights-are-workers-rights-doordash-edition"><span data-contrast="none">labor rights</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, and our </span><a href="https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/3645/"><span data-contrast="none">consumer rights</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> - at scale.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">After decades of regulatory indifference to tech monopolization, competition authorities all over the world are taking on Big Tech. The DMA is by far the most muscular and ambitious salvo we’ve seen.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">Seen in that light, it’s no surprise that Big Tech is refusing to comply with the rules. If the EU successfully forces tech to play fair, it will serve as a starting gun for a global race to the top, in which tech’s ill-gotten gains - of data, power and money - will be returned to the users and workers from whom that treasure came.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">The architects of the DMA and DSA foresaw this, of course. </span><a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/eu-opens-dma-investigations/"><span data-contrast="none">They’ve announced investigations into Apple, Google and Meta</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, threatening </span><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/european-commission-antitrust-investigation-apple-meta-alphabet/"><span data-contrast="none">fines of 10 percent of the companies’ global income, which will </span><i><span data-contrast="none">double</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> to 20 percent</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> if the companies don’t toe the line.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It’s not just Big Tech that’s playing for all the marbles - it’s also the systems of democratic control and accountability. If Apple can sabotage the DMA’s insistence on taking away its veto over its customers’ software choices, that will spill over into </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1344546/dl?inline"><span data-contrast="none">the US Department of Justice’s case over the same issue</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, as well as the cases in </span><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Japan-to-crack-down-on-Apple-and-Google-app-store-monopolies"><span data-contrast="none">Japan</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> and </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-considers-505-mln-fine-against-google-apple-over-app-market-practices-2023-10-06/"><span data-contrast="none">South Korea</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, and the </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-wins-appeal-in-apple-case"><span data-contrast="none">pending enforcement action in the UK</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
