    <h1>Unix as a tool forge and how Emacs fits in Unix philosophy</h1>

One might argue that Emacs goes against Unix philosophy, for it can quite literally do pretty much everything. But that only violates the first ruleâ€”if you consider Emacs to be a tool forge, then Emacs is quite in line with the Unix philosophy. Emacs provides functions that all work on the buffer or bits of text, and these can all be composed to craft a work environment to fit your needs. <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~ashton314/.dotfiles">I use</a> over 100 different packages, and they all play nice together!</p>

I have come to view Emacs as my primary forge. It&#39;s my layer on top of Unix, if you will. If I have Emacs customized how I like it, it doesn&#39;t matter too much what operating system lives underneath: I can get a lot of work done. I used to view Emacs just as a tool, and I used it exclusively as a text editor. As time went on, though, I began to value the extreme keyboard-centric control Emacs gave me over my system. That&#39;s why I <a href="https://lambdaland.org/posts/2020-07-22-gui-emacs/">moved from the terminal to the GUI</a> version of Emacs: I wanted to have more modifiers available to bind functions to.</p>

Many people use Emacs exclusively as a text editor, and that&#39;s fine. Usually these people have gotten comfortable with the command line, which is just another kind of tool forge. The great thing is both places make building new tools easy. Whatever your toolkit (though I do recommend you add Emacs to it if it&#39;s not already there!) make sure you can build new tools with ease.</p>
