    <h1>Two classic radiosity books now free</h1>

<p>John Wallace, with Michael Cohen’s help, just finished the hard work of freeing a book they coauthored on radiosity, putting it under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">the least-restrictive Creative Commons license</a>. They wrote the first computer graphics book on the subject, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Radiosity-Realistic-Synthesis-Kaufmann-Computer/dp/0121782700">Radiosity and Realistic Image Synthesis</a></em>, in 1993. It is now <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/Cohen-Wallace_Radiosity_and_Realistic_Image_Synthesis.pdf"><strong>free for download</strong></a>. Skimming through the plates at the beginning is a walk down memory lane for me.</p>



<p>Michael Herf mentioned Ian’s book to me in Nov. 2022, asking if I knew of anything better on the subject of lighting units at this point. We included Ian in the conversation about resources (I had just finished <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/physical-units-for-lights/">my own summary</a> – I wish I had recalled Ian had one before wading into this topic!).</p>



<p>Ian wrote: “Being self-taught in photometry and radiometry beginning in 1980, I struggled mightily at first with such concepts as illuminance and luminance with only the IES Lighting Handbook to guide me. I remembered this when writing my book, and focused on explaining the topics intuitively with a minimal amount of mathematics.”</p>



<p>Consider reading each books’ early chapters if you want a solid introduction to the terminology and equations of lighting. And, if you’d like to free up a book you have authored, please make the effort! In case it’s a help, I recorded some notes about <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/an-introduction-to-ray-tracing-is-now-free-for-download/">the process Andrew Glassner went through</a> when freeing up <em>An Introduction to Ray Tracing</em> in 2019.</p>
