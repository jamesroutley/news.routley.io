These charges carry a maximum sentence of 110 years.</p><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried’s sentencing is set for March 28.</p><div><p>The FTX founder became a symbol of crypto’s excesses last year, when his company collapsed and he was charged with stealing as much as $10 billion from customers to finance political contributions, venture capital investments and other extravagant spending.</p><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried, 31, is expected to appeal.</p><p>The <a href="#who-are-the-jurors-deciding-sam-bankman-frieds-fate" title="">jury of nine women and three men</a> began deliberations on Thursday afternoon following nearly two weeks of testimony spread out over the past month. Witnesses — including his one-time girlfriend Caroline Ellison, who ran Alameda Research, a crypto trading firm he founded — blamed Mr. Bankman-Fried for the sudden failure of both companies less than a year ago.</p><p>Federal prosecutors accused Mr. Bankman-Fried of treating FTX as his personal piggy bank, saying he had used customer money to bolster his ambitions and prop up Alameda Research.</p><p>The trial moved faster than anticipated with the prosecution calling more than a dozen witnesses — but fewer than they had planned. The defense called just three witnesses, including Mr. Bankman-Fried, whose testimony before the jury spanned parts of three days.</p><p>Here’s what to know:</p><ul><li><p>Prosecutors <a href="#sam-bankman-fried-witness-highlights" title="">called as witnesses</a> three former top advisers to Mr. Bankman-Fried, all of whom had pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate. In all, prosecutors called a half-dozen former employees of Mr. Bankman-Fried as witnesses.</p></li><li><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried’s decision to take the stand allowed him to argue he had no intent to steal money and defraud anyone. But it was a risky move and Mr. Bankman-Fried said he “couldn’t recall” more than 140 times in response to questions on cross-examination.</p></li><li><p>The defense portrayed Mr. Bankman-Fried as a “math nerd” who built a thriving business only to see it undone by forces largely outside of his control. His lawyer said in a closing statement that the three cooperators were only testifying against him to save themselves from long prison sentences.</p></li><li><p>The prosecution countered that Mr. Bankman-Fried’s former employees, in pleading guilty, were accepting responsibility for their actions — something Mr. Bankman-Fried was unwilling to do. Prosecutors in their closing argument told the jury that Mr. Bankman-Fried had built his crypto empire on a “foundation of lies and false promises.”</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="48" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzkxZGNkM2YwLTZjYTctNWNhOC04NjBlLTY1OGQyNTk4NDRmYQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/02/business/sam-bankman-fried-trial#inside-sam-bankman-frieds-wild-rise-and-abrupt-crash" data-source-id="100000009163620"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-streitfeld"><img alt="David Streitfeld" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/01/multimedia/author-david-streitfeld/author-david-streitfeld-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p><div><p><span><time aria-hidden="true" datetime="2023-11-03T00:53:14.319Z"><p><span data-time="abs">Nov. 2, 2023, 8:53 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">Nov. 2, 2023, 8:53 p.m. ET</span></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Sam Bankman-Fried once partied with stars and big shots, doled out fortunes in looted funds to politicians and himself and was acclaimed as the next Warren Buffett.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erika P.

Lawyers, accountants and regulators are nowhere to be found. Investors insist entrepreneurs take their money. The world trembles on the brink of change.</p><p>For dot-coms, the moment was 1999. For artificial intelligence, it was just over nine months ago. For cryptocurrency, it was 2017.</p><div><p>Six years ago, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/style/sam-bankman-fried-hair-style-trial.html" title="">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> knew little about alternative currencies. But he correctly bet there were huge opportunities in grabbing a tiny piece of millions of crypto trades. In the blink of an eye, he was lauded as being worth $23 billion. Only Mark Zuckerberg had accumulated so much wealth so young.</p><p>The Facebook co-founder has his critics, but he looks like Thomas Edison next to Mr. Bankman-Fried. After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/04/technology/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-trial.html" title="">a speedy trial</a> in Manhattan federal court, the onetime crypto king, now 31, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/technology/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-trial-ftx.html" title="">convicted on Thursday</a> of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy involving his companies FTX and Alameda Research.</p><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried once partied with stars and big shots, doled out fortunes in looted funds to politicians and himself, was acclaimed as <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/08/01/ftx-crypto-sam-bankman-fried-interview/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the next Warren Buffett,</a> employed his friends and made them rich for a while, was courted by the news media that printed his most banal comments. For a time, everyone loved Sam Bankman-Fried — with the apparent exception of Sam Bankman-Fried.</p><p>“I am, and for most of my adult life have been, sad.” That plaintive statement appears at the end of testimony Mr. Bankman-Fried had hoped to give Congress last winter before his arrest scuttled his plans. He was onto something.</p><p>In photographs from his heyday, Mr. Bankman-Fried always looked awkward, embarrassed and as if he would rather be playing a video game, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/zeke-faux-number-go-up-book-excerpt.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even when Gisele Bündchen had an arm around him</a>. Everyone kept insisting he was off-the-charts brilliant, the entrepreneur who would create the future. Maybe he knew better.</p><p>As journalists — and now prosecutors — have made clear, FTX and Alameda were run by a group of hapless young people who did not have the required skills, maturity or patience. Those who actually had a moral compass and sensed something was wrong soon peeled off, leaving a core crew who drifted — or perhaps dived — into trouble.</p><p>“When I started working at Alameda, I don’t think I would have believed you if you told me I would be sending false balance sheets to our lenders or taking customer money, but over time it was something I became more comfortable with,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/technology/caroline-ellison-sam-bankman-fried-trial.html" title="">Caroline Ellison</a>, Mr. Bankman-Fried’s colleague and sometime girlfriend, testified during the trial.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="45" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYWJiNzFkNDgtNTc3My01ZDMyLWJmZTItOTg1ODgyNjU2M2I1"><div id="abb71d48-5773-5d32-bfe2-9858826563b5" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/02/business/sam-bankman-fried-trial#abb71d48-5773-5d32-bfe2-9858826563b5"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="J.

According to the prosecutor, Mr. Bankman-Fried said he “couldn’t recall” more than 140 times in response to questions on cross-examination.</p><p>“It was uncomfortable to hear,” said Mr. Roos, who also highlighted inconsistencies between the testimony of Mr. Bankman-Fried and that of his former employees, including three who pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.</p><p>Mr. Roos also pointed out instances of Mr. Bankman-Fried appearing to deliberately use FTX customer deposits — a key element of a case in which he is accused of using the firm as his personal piggy bank and stealing as much as $10 billion from FTX’s customers to fund lavish spending and prop up his crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research.</p><p>Mr. Cohen presented his client as well meaning and suggested that prosecutors have sought to turn Mr. Bankman-Fried into “some sort of villain, some sort of monster.”</p><p>The reality, he said, is that Mr. Bankman-Fried is a “math nerd” who may have made some bad business decisions, but did not commit any crimes or tell anyone to break the law.</p><p>Mr. Cohen portrayed the collapse of FTX as a series of business decisions and that the prosecution’s retelling of it was exaggerated and cinematic. “In the real world, unlike the movie world, things can get messy,” Mr. Cohen said. The big spending by FTX and Alameda, he added, “were reasonable corporate expenses” and not a misuse of customer money.</p><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried, he said, had acted in good faith in making his business decisions and lacked the criminal intent to defraud anyone. Mr. Cohen reminded the jury it is the prosecution’s burden to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that Mr. Bankman-Fried is not obligated to prove anything.</p><p>Mr. Cohen told the jury his client had testified “because he wanted to tell you what happened.”</p><p>“It is hard to think of a more stressful situation than that,” he said. “He was far from polished.

Kaplan finalized a jury of nine women and three men on the second day of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s trial last month. The jurors came from all walks of life. The youngest is 33 and the oldest is 65. Several are immigrants, including one from Hong Kong and another from Ukraine.</p><div><p>At least one is a business owner, while one works for the U.S. Postal Service as a vehicle maintenance worker. Another is a retired correctional officer. A high school librarian in the Bronx and a special-education teacher in Rockland County, N.Y., were also selected. Other jurors include a former investment banker from Salomon Brothers, a former nonprofit fund-raiser and an account executive at an advertising firm.</p><p>The New York Times does not print the names of jurors so as to not interfere with a trial.</p><p>Jurors had arrived in Manhattan federal court by 9:30 a.m. since Mr. Bankman-Fried’s trial started on Oct. 3. Getting a dozen people to arrive in a courtroom consistently has required Judge Kaplan to make some logistical accommodations.</p><p>The court wrapped up early in the trial’s first week so one juror could make a flight for a parents’ weekend at his daughter’s college. Another juror recently noted she had a Friday flight to catch for her uncle’s 70th birthday. Judge Kaplan offered to have the court write to the airline if changing the flight resulted in additional fees.</p><p>One alternate juror came to court on the first day Mr. Bankman-Fried testified and reported feeling sick and vomiting, but he told Judge Kaplan he did not want to be excused and miss the rest of the trial. He was dismissed anyway.</p><p>“I’m simply not going to take a risk that he has something infectious that could affect anyone else,” Judge Kaplan said at the time. “Of course he has our thanks.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM2MTgzZTQ5LTM2MTAtNTc3Zi05Y2I1LTEyZTcxMmZlYjIwMw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/02/business/sam-bankman-fried-trial#sam-bankman-fried-witness-highlights" data-source-id="100000009137385"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/j-edward-moreno"><img alt="J.

They said the FTX founder had known for months that the exchange had no way of paying back at least $8 billion in customer money that was used to buy lavish real estate, invest in other crypto companies, make campaign contributions, and pay back lenders to a trading firm that Mr. Bankman-Fried also controlled.</p><div><p>Here are highlights of the testimony from several prosecution witnesses — including Mr. Bankman-Fried’s employee and on-again, off-again girlfriend, Caroline Ellison — who have been central to the case:</p><h3 id="link-77a3bf45"><span>Adam Yedidia</span></h3><p>The first prosecution witness was Adam Yedidia, a former FTX developer who was a close friend of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s and lived with him and other associates in the Bahamas.</p><p>Mr. Yedidia, who has not been charged with any crimes and testified under immunity, said Mr. Bankman-Fried had known that FTX and Alameda Research, a sister crypto trading firm, were on thin ice.</p><p>Mr. Yedidia described a conversation he had with Mr. Bankman-Fried at their paddle tennis court the summer before FTX collapsed, as the crypto market crashed and lenders to Alameda were asking for their money back. Mr. Yedidia said Mr. Bankman-Fried had told him that FTX “was bulletproof last year, but we’re not bulletproof this year” and that it would take six months to three years to make the company “bulletproof again.”</p><h3 id="link-72865b1c"><span>Caroline Ellison</span></h3><p>Ms. Ellison, who ran Alameda and was Mr. Bankman-Fried’s former girlfriend, was the government’s star witness. She detailed the close relationship between Alameda and FTX, including several instances when, she said, Mr. Bankman-Fried directed or greenlighted the use of FTX’s customer deposits.</p><p>Ms. Ellison, who has pleaded guilty to fraud charges and is cooperating with prosecutors, said Mr. Bankman-Fried had been eager to buy back FTX shares from Binance, a rival crypto exchange. She was apprehensive about the move, she said, because she knew that would mean borrowing $1 billion in FTX customer funds for the transaction.</p><p>“That’s OK, I think this is really important, we have to get it done,” Mr. Bankman-Fried told Ms. Ellison, according to her testimony.</p><p>Ms. Ellison also offered insight into Mr. Bankman-Fried’s mind-set, detailing their relationship and his somewhat unconventional view that rules about not lying and not stealing were of lesser importance than actions that he saw as serving a greater good.</p><h3 id="link-2b5a6795"><span>Gary Wang</span></h3><p>Mr. Wang, an FTX co-founder who has pleaded guilty in the case and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, told the jury that Mr. Bankman-Fried had directed him to include features on the exchange that gave Alameda an advantage on the platform. “In the end, it was Sam’s decision,” he testified.</p><p>The soft-spoken coder spent much of his time on the stand explaining the intricacies of FTX’s computer code, which supported prosecutors’ point that Alameda was intentionally given special privileges on the platform so it could use FTX customer deposits as if they were a piggy bank.</p><p>Mr. Wang met Mr. Bankman-Fried in high school math camp, and they were classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before founding FTX together in 2019.</p><h3 id="link-43417cc8"><span>Nishad Singh</span></h3><p>Mr. Singh, a former FTX executive who has also pleaded guilty, detailed Mr. Bankman-Fried’s lavish spending, including big real estate purchases and political donations. That spending, he said, was bankrolled by FTX customer deposits.</p><p>Mr. Singh said he had given other associates access to his bank accounts to make political donations under his name, including Mr. Bankman-Fried’s younger brother, Gabe, who ran the nonprofit group Guarding Against Pandemics. At one point, when a credit wire wasn’t going through, Gabe Bankman-Fried sent one of his assistants to the Bahamas “with a bunch of checks from my bank account,” Mr. Singh testified.</p><p>Prosecutors also showed an email exchange between Mr. Singh and Mr. Bankman-Fried’s mother, Barbara Fried, who was receiving $1 million from FTX for her nonprofit Mind the Gap. Ms. Fried, a Stanford law professor, suggested that Mr. Singh make the donation under his name “because we don’t want to create the impression that funding MTG is a family affair, as opposed to a collective effort by many people (including some mystery guy Nishad Singh :)).”</p><h3 id="link-58aa6ff"><span>Can Sun</span></h3><p>Mr. Sun, a former top FTX lawyer, testified that Mr. Bankman-Fried had pushed him to find a legal justification for the exchange’s repeated misuse of billions in customer money — even after Mr. Sun told his boss there was none.</p><p>At Mr. Bankman-Fried’s urging, Mr. Sun said, he ran through a few theoretical options to justify the borrowing and spending of FTX customer money. But Mr. Sun, who testified after securing an agreement that prosecutors would not pursue charges against him, said he had once again told Mr. Bankman-Fried that none of those options were supported “by the facts.” Mr. Bankman-Fried responded by saying “something like, ‘Got it,’” Mr. Sun testified.</p><p>Prosecutors then played a clip from an interview that Mr. Bankman-Fried gave ABC’s “Good Morning America” days before FTX filed for bankruptcy in November. In that interview, Mr. Bankman-Fried offered up one of the theoretical options that Mr. Sun had provided him as an explanation for what happened to FTX’s customer money.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
