<li>yes it&#39;s wednesday again, maybe i should just purposely aim to always release these mid-week.</li>
<li>cut out the paper pattern for my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1515577710/side-tie-dungarees-pattern-digital-pdf">side-tie dungarees</a> finally. now i&#39;m worrying i did too sloppy a job as some of the sets of lines aren&#39;t perfectly overlapping where i had to tape the two a0 sheets together. the dungarees are meant to be forgiving when worn, so we&#39;ll see how forgiving sewing the pattern is of bad cutting!</li>
<li>started reading the parable of the sower by octavia butler on sunday 20th as that&#39;s when the begins in the book! it&#39;s heavy and harrowing but a really gripping read, i recommend with trigger warning for sexual violence, regular violence, descriptions of torture and death so far?</li>
<li>been watching the newest season of doctor who, just got to the first episode i thought was narratively passable, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/may/18/doctor-who-boom-ncuti-gatwa-millie-gibson-steven-moffat-landmine-recap">Boom</a>. ncuti gatwa and millie gibson act their asses off every episode but it&#39;s hard to fight a script!</li>
<li>my video ideas have been blooming into multi-hour monsters so as I maybe said last week, parking them and trying to come up with newer, shorter ideas. marvelling that anyone has said anything interesting in 60 seconds, ever.</li>
