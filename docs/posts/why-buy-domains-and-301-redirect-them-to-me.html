    <h1>Ask HN: Why buy domains and 301 redirect them to me?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Say I&#39;m running a SaaS product, example.com.</p><p>Somebody has bought several domains like getexample.com, buyexample.io, joinexample.net, and is 301 redirecting them to example.com.</p><p>What&#39;s their play here? Is this setup for a phishing attack in the future? Are they just going to try and sell the domains to me in the future? Not encountered behaviour like this before (or at least, I don&#39;t know if this is the beginning phase of a common scam)</p></div></td></div></div>
