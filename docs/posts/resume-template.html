  <p>A Typst resume template for anyone who wants to use or modify it. I got started with Typst a couple of days before and threw this together based on my old LaTeX resume.</p>
<p>Since creating my resume in Typst, I&#39;ve had to go back and update or customize it a few times. It has felt much less cumbersome to do so with this template (and in Typst in general) than it was when I was fighting LaTeX or MS Word.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Define individual items in items.typ, add these items to the section lists in sections.typ, and customize the order of the sections in main.typ. If you open this in the <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst web editor</a> and double-click on any of the text in the preview output, it will jump you to the point in the code to edit it.</p>
<p>I recommend making variables at the top of items.typ for things like schools and cities, if any of those repeat often in your resume data.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The positioning of the (optional) links in the projects section is a little weird. If your project titles are too long, you&#39;ll have to adjust the position manually. Suggestions welcome.</p>
<h2>Other Information</h2>
<p>SVG&#39;s are from the free pack at <a href="https://fontawesome.com/download">Font Awesome</a>. I only included the ones I used.</p>
<p>Thank you to my wife for supplying Discworld trivia for the sample resume. I have no idea who Contemplate Mibbons is, but I like the idea that silly academia wizards do weather analysis in Rust.</p>
