    <h1>Is It Even Worth Working on FOSS Anymore?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I don’t know how to introduce this post other than the question in the title:
<strong>is it even worth working on Free and Open Source Software anymore?</strong></p>
<p>I have been asking myself this for the past week or two, and it’s uncomfortable
for me; I <em>believe</em> in the power of Open Source to empower users and to give
<em>them</em> control over their machines.</p>
<h2 id="exploited-foss">Exploited FOSS</h2>
<p>But that belief of mine has been severely shaken by several things happened this
week, things which also made me reconsider things that happened further in the
past as well.</p>
<h3 id="log4j"><code>log4j</code></h3>
<p>First, the <a href="https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/"><code>log4j</code> vulnerabilities</a> happened. The maintainers worked to fix
it, and what do they get?</p>

<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Log4j maintainers have been working sleeplessly on mitigation measures; fixes, docs, CVE, replies to inquiries, etc. Yet nothing is stopping people to bash us, for work we aren&#39;t paid for, for a feature we all dislike yet needed to keep due to backward compatibility concerns. <a href="https://t.co/W2u6AcBUM8">https://t.co/W2u6AcBUM8</a></p>— Volkan Yazıcı (@yazicivo) <a href="https://twitter.com/yazicivo/status/1469349956880408583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2021</a></blockquote>
<p>So, it turns out that most of the development work on <code>log4j</code> is not funded, and
what is funded is pitifully small.</p>
<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the maintainer who fixed the vulnerability that&#39;s causing millions(++?) of dollars of damage.</p>— Filippo ${jndi:ldap://filippo.io/x} Valsorda (@FiloSottile) <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1469441487175880711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2021</a></blockquote>
<p>And remember, there are people bashing the maintainers for screwing up something
they essentially did as <em>volunteers</em>!</p>
<p>This is something that happens all of the time. When a vulnerability is
discovered in a critical piece of software, people complain to maintainers whom
they have never once thanked, helped, or paid.</p>
<h3 id="obs-studio">OBS Studio</h3>
<p>Also from this week:</p>
<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember yesterday’s news about TikTok releasing a go live platform? Turns out it’s a fork of <a href="https://twitter.com/OBSProject?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OBSProject</a> </p>— Naaackers (@Naaackers) <a href="https://twitter.com/Naaackers/status/1471494415306788870?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2021</a></blockquote>
<p>Yes, it is that simple: TikTok stole code from an Open Source project.</p>
<p>The license OBS Studio is under, the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPL</a>, requires anyone who distributes
the code to anyone else to publish their changes in source code, and TikTok
obviously did not do that.</p>
<h3 id="elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</h3>
<p>This is not from this week.</p>
<p>Because Amazon started offering Elasticsearch, it was <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">relicensed</a>. Some
people perceived the move <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/01/19/Elasticsearch-does-not-belong-to-Elastic.html">poorly</a>, and I can’t blame them.</p>
<h3 id="audacity">Audacity</h3>
<p>A company “bought” Audacity and <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/pull/835">added spyware</a>. The same company also did it
to MuseScore.</p>
<h2 id="patterns">Patterns</h2>
<p>These things are not just one-off bad things; they are patterns in the software
industry. In fact, they’re so pervasive, they have a name: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_patterns">dark patterns</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some more examples.</p>
<h3 id="ads-in-paid-products">Ads in Paid Products</h3>
<p>Adding ads to software seems to be in vogue, with Microsoft doing it to Windows,
even though <em>people pay for Windows</em>.</p>
<p>That also goes for “smart” TV’s. Ads get added later, after you have had it for
a while.</p>
<h3 id="spyware-in-paid-products">Spyware in Paid Products</h3>
<p>Windows also has spyware, and you better believe that smart devices do as well,
even if you paid for them. Yes, that includes Apple products.</p>
<h3 id="companies-pushing-subscription-models">Companies Pushing Subscription Models</h3>
<p>Even worse is when companies push subscription models when you already bought
their product, or they make it difficult to cancel a subscription.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe switched their Creative Suite to Creative Cloud.</li>
<li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/toyota-owners-have-to-pay-8-mo-to-keep-using-their-key-fob-for-remote-start/">Toyota wants customers to subscribe to use remote start.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/11/the-end-of-click-to-subscribe-call-to-cancel-one-of-the-news-industrys-favorite-retention-tactics-is-illegal-ftc-says/">A lot of companies allow you to subscribe online, but must call to
cancel.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Why do they do this? Easy: because a subscription model brings in constant,
endless revenue. It’s exactly what MBA suits like. And they don’t want to lose
it once they get it.</p>
<h2 id="scarcity-of-maintainer-attention">Scarcity of Maintainer Attention</h2>
<p>Coming back to Open Source, it is obvious that there is a huge deficit of
something we need more of: maintainer attention.</p>
<p>It makes sense why there is scarcity; after all, this is work done by volunteers
in their “free” time. They may not have much free time at all!</p>
<p>And yet, these projects are critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency_2x.png">
<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency_2x.png" alt="xkcd 2347: Dependency" aria-label="xkcd 2347: Dependency"/>
</a>
</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">xkcd 2347: Dependency</a></p>
<p>Companies that depend on these projects are like runaway logging companies: they
are mining a scarce resource and not ensuring its sustainability.</p>
<p>The logging companies learned the lesson, and it’s time the software industry
learned it.</p>
<h2 id="copilot">Copilot</h2>
<p>If straight up ignoring licenses, like TikTok did, wasn’t enough, there is now
another way companies can extract value from FOSS without paying back: <a href="https://copilot.github.com/">GitHub’s
Copilot</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gavinhoward.com/2021/10/my-whitepaper-about-github-copilot/">I’ve written before</a> about the dangers of GitHub Copilot, and while the
hype and bad press have died down, the dangers have not.</p>
<p>I’ve been busy to do something; I have written <a href="https://yzena.com/licenses/">licenses</a> to make GitHub
hesitate before using my code as input to Copilot, and I’m currently trying to
find lawyers to help me solidify those licenses.</p>
<div>
<p>Unfortunately, I can budget very little, about one hour’s worth of time for the
attorney I would have used, and he thought I needed five hours&#39; worth of work.</p>
<p>I have contacted a couple of non-profits for help, but I don’t expect to get any
because they probably have bigger fish to fry.</p>
</div>
<p>But even if I solidify the licenses, what stops GitHub from ignoring them by
claiming that their Terms of Service allows them to use my code?</p>

<p>And beyond that, what stops other companies from using Copilot to <a href="https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1410037309848752128">launder my
code</a>?</p>
<h2 id="my-hesitation">My Hesitation</h2>
<p>Before all of this went down, I was working on Rig, a new build system, one that
would scale from <a href="https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2021/09/small-project-build-systems.html">small projects</a>, to <a href="https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2021/09/huge-project-build-systems.html">large projects</a>, to <a href="https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2021/09/reflecting-on-shake-build-system.html">everything
in-between</a>, including fully distributed and cached builds.</p>
<p>The ideas are so powerful, in fact, that they can form the basis of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_package_manager">Nix</a>-like package manager, an event-based supervision system that would be
vastly simpler than <code>systemd</code> while easier to use than s6, and a DevOps
deployment system.</p>
<div>
<p>In fact, to implement the DevOps deployment system, no changes will be needed to
Rig <em>at all</em>; it could do that without any outside help.</p>
<p>In essence, Rig would have been able to build distributed systems in exactly the
same way it would build a single project: you specify targets and their
dependencies, and Rig would do the rest, including parallelization.</p>
</div>
<p>But…will it even matter? Would Rig even be a net gain to the world?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is yes, but it’s not so simple.</p>
<p>Since companies steal Open Source software without a care in the world, what’s
to stop companies from stealing Rig and embedding it into their proprietary
software?</p>
<p>What will stop them from using Rig to spy on users? What will stop them from
using Rig to feed users ads and manipulate them?</p>
<p>What’s to stop them from using Rig to backdoor <em>every piece of software that
they build with it</em>, or to distribute a version to users that will backdoor
whatever the <em>users</em> build with it?</p>
<p>In other words, what’s to stop companies from using an Open Source Rig to harm
users more than it would help?</p>
<h2 id="open-source-or-bust">Open Source or Bust</h2>
<p>Okay, well, perhaps the best way to serve users is to <em>not</em> release my code as
Open Source? Maybe I should just provide binaries.</p>
<p>That won’t work because Open Source has sort of eaten the software industry;
other <em>programmers</em> won’t use your stuff unless it’s Open Source.</p>
<p>Of course, those programmers are all too happy to hide their code from end
users, who don’t know better.</p>
<p>Since my software will target programmers, I can’t make it closed source, or it
won’t get used. Simple as that.</p>
<p>It’s even worse; Linux distros will often refuse to even <em>package</em> your software
if it’s not Open Source.</p>
<p>I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. If I make Rig Open Source, it could
very well do more harm than good, regardless of whether I get paid! And if I
don’t, it won’t get used anyway.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ever since I started trying to not write harmful posts (like <a href="https://gavinhoward.com/2021/01/dynamic-linking-needs-to-die/">this one</a>), I
have tried to suggest ways of fixing the problems I have complained about in
every post.</p>
<p>But…I can’t do that here. I <em>have no solution</em>.</p>
<p>This is depressing, to say the least. It’s depressing because I see no
alternative other than to give up on writing software completely. After all, I
<a href="https://gavinhoward.com/2020/08/the-software-industry-is-broken/">can’t get a job</a>, I can’t make money from writing Open Source software, and
what Open Source software I do write could end up harming more users than it
helps.</p>
<p>I had to accept I couldn’t get a job, but I still thought I could write software
in my spare time and help the world.</p>
<p>Was I wrong? Is it now impossible to improve the world with Open Source?</p>
<p>I don’t have the answers to these questions. Until I do, I feel like I should
default to doing nothing.</p>
