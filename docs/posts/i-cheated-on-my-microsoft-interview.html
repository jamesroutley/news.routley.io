    <h1>I Cheated on My Microsoft Interview</h1>

The tech industry hadn’t yet fully recovered from the bubble bursting, so programming jobs were pretty hard to come by. I was applying for jobs everywhere, but just couldn’t seem to get an interview.</p><p>One day, I saw a flyer pinned to the mostly empty job board in the Computer Science department. It said that Microsoft would be coming to the campus for a job fair. I immediately sent my resume to the email address on the flyer, not expecting to hear anything back.</p><p>A few days later, to my surprise, I got an email from a recruiter at Microsoft. She invited me to a 15 minute interview with a Microsoft representative during the career fair. I was thrilled! This would be my first real job interview ever.</p><p>I immediately called my good friend Eli who had just started a new job at Microsoft. I asked him what the on campus interviews were like and how I should prepare for them. He explained that they would ask a random programming question that I would need to solve on a sheet of paper. If you did well, then they would fly you out for a full day of interviews at the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. He had been asked to write a function that, when given an array of length n + 1 containing integers 1 through n, find the duplicate integer in an array.</p><p>I wasn’t sure how to prepare for answering a “random programming question”, so I decided to just use the question Eli had been asked as practice and hope for the best. Over the next few days I thought about different ways to implement the function. At one point I had a flash of insight: there is probably a mathematical formula for calculating the sum of 1 to n. So I looked it up and sure enough, there is:</p><p>sum(1 to n) = n(n + 1) / 2</p><p>If I used the formula to calculate the expected sum, then summed all the integers in the array, the difference between the two values would be the duplicate number. Cool!</p><p>A few weeks later I’m about to go in for my interview and I’m so nervous I can barely think straight. I finally got a job interview and I didn’t want to blow it. There are dozens of developers interviewing today and only a few of us will be invited to fly out for a full round of interviews. It’s finally my turn. Most of the interview is a blur, but I remember the interviewer being nice and I remember the programming question he asked me. I’ll never forget the programming question:</p><p>Write a function that, when given an array of length n + 1 containing integers 1 through n, find the duplicate integer in an array.</p><p>I couldn’t believe it. He asked me the exact same question as Eli. Should I tell him? I hesitated for a moment, pretending to be thinking about how to solve the problem. In reality I was having an intense internal debate on the ethics of interviewing. He didn’t ask me if I had <em>heard</em> the question before, he just asked me to solve it. So I decided to just answer the question.</p><p>I casually explained how I could simply use a mathematical formula to calculate the sum of 1 to n (like, who doesn’t know the sum(1 to n) formula?) and compare that to the sum of the integers in the array. I slowly wrote out the solution I had come up with over days of thinking about the problem, being sure to pause periodically as if I was figuring it out for the first time. I talked through my thinking and made sure I had all the proper error checking in place. I double and triple checked my syntax. My handwritten code was perfect.</p><p>He seemed impressed as he reviewed by code. When he was done, he told me that the interview was over and thanked me for coming in. I walked out of the interview room feeling pretty good…until I saw all the other students waiting outside for their turn to interview. I felt like I had an unfair advantage. My preparation, plus a crazy coincidence, made me feel like I had cheated on my interview.</p><p>A few days later I received an invite to fly out to the Microsoft main offices. I interviewed with two teams over a period of 6+ hours. I didn’t get asked any questions I had heard before this time, but I did my best. During my final interview of the day I was asked which team I would want to work for. I took that as a very good sign!</p><p>Sure enough, that next week I had a job offer from Microsoft from both teams. I ended up joining the Windows Shell (UX) team and working with some absolute legends like Raymond Chen and Chris Guzak. Within a couple of years of graduating from college, I had shipped software that was being used by nearly a billion people. It was surreal seeing people everywhere using something I had made.</p><p>I’ve struggled with this a lot over the years, but I finally decided to share my story. I don’t think I would have made it past the first round of interviews at Microsoft if I hadn’t gotten so lucky. So pretty much, my entire career is built on one amazing stroke of luck.</p><p>I also think my experience is a great example of one of the many reasons why the coding problems we use in developer interviews are so problematic: on the spot coding is just not a good way to judge technical ability. While it may have worked in my case, it definitely didn’t work the way Microsoft had intended. Ironically, because I had several days to think about the problem and work out a solution, my on-campus interview might have been a better measure of my ability. Today you could just Google the programming problem I was asked and find a dozen solutions, but that didn’t exist back in 2004. I had to draw on years of learning and consult external resources like a math textbook, just like I do every day at work. I think a better interview format would give the candidate time to work out a creative solution to a problem on their own without requiring an exorbitant amount of their time. (I’m not a fan of take home coding projects.)</p><p>I’m working on a follow up blog post with some ideas on better ways to do programming interviews. Stay tuned.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div>
