  <p>Going as Former Gifted Child for Halloween and the whole costume is just gonna

  to be a lot of things.”</p>

<h2 id="christopher-langan">Christopher Langan</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan">Chris Langan</a> became famous
when television networks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-788Upky2Y">interviewed him</a> for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan#IQ_testing">allegedly scoring ~170 on an IQ test</a>.</p>
<p>Langan has not produced any acclaimed works of art or science. In this way, he
differs significantly from outsider intellectuals like Paul Erdös, Stephen
Wolfram, Nassim Taleb, etc.</p>

<p>But Langan is clearly a smart guy. He
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan#IQ_testing">probably cleared 140+ on an IQ test</a>.
He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-788Upky2Y">speaks like a book</a>. He won
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH2hiwhsZZU">$250,000 on a major trivia show</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miVG2xT5jY">this interview</a>
breaks my heart. The resentment, the eugenics, the hubris -- Langan earned a
reputation as
<a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/more-smarter-ward">&#34;Alex Jones with a thesaurus&#34;</a>
and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDmcoYpTTbE">&#34;the Steven Seagal of intellectuals&#34;</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want you to hate this guy. Yes, he actively promotes poisonous rhetoric
-- ignore that for now. This is about <em>you</em>. Reflect on all your setbacks, your
unmet potential, and the raw unfairness of it all. It sucks, and you mustn&#39;t let
that bitterness engulf you. You can forgive history itself; you can practice
gratitude towards an unjust world. You need no credentials, nor awards, nor
secrets, nor skills to do so. You are allowed to like yourself.</p>
<p>Langan
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan#Biography">had a rough childhood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Langan&#39;s biological father left before he was born, and is said to have died
  in Mexico. Langan&#39;s mother married three more times, and had a son by each
  husband. Her second husband was murdered, and her third killed himself. Langan
  grew up with the fourth husband Jack Langan, who has been described as a
  &#34;failed journalist&#34; who used a bullwhip as a disciplinary measure and went on
  drinking sprees, disappearing from the house, locking the kitchen cabinets so
  the four boys could not get to the food in them. The family was very poor;
  Langan recalls that they all had only one set of clothes each. The family
  moved around, living for a while in a teepee on an Indian reservation, then
  later in Virginia City, Nevada.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trauma never excuses nasty behavior, and that&#39;s not the point. This is still
about <em>you</em>. You can learn about yourself through others&#39; stories, and empathy
is scariest when you confront similar nastiness within yourself.</p>
<p>You will never have enough IQ, nor money, nor time, nor energy. It&#39;s no excuse.
<em>You</em> are enough -- no, no, you are <em>plenty</em>.</p>
<h2 id="kim-ung-yong">Kim Ung-yong</h2>
<p>Instead of competing in real games, some people construct insignificant/winnable
sub-games. These people are called
<a href="https://commoncog.com/playing-to-play-playing-to-win/">&#34;scrubs&#34;</a>. They want to
compete, but they cannot bear losing; they want to win, but they are too
risk-averse and too undisciplined to excel in fair play. People who commit to
such worthless/unwinnable games are called &#34;losers&#34;.</p>
<p>But you forget that participation is optional. You perpetually sear your bespoke
definition of &#34;success&#34; directly onto your forehead. You&#39;ve been enduring your
pain for so long that you can&#39;t remember how it feels to be free from
expectation, from ambition, from guilt, from inferiority, from -- no, you don&#39;t
have to do any of this. You <em>may</em> do whatever you want, and you may do
<em>whatever</em> you want.</p>
<p>According to his parents,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ung-yong">Kim Ung-yong</a> started calculus at
age 3, scored 210 on an IQ test and started studying physics at Hanyang
University at age 4, spoke five languages by age 5, and received an invitation
to work at NASA by age 7.</p>
<p>In 2010, this is how Kim
<a href="https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/south-korean-professor-once-smartest-person-in-world/">reflected on his childhood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>At that time, I led my life like a machine--I woke up, solved the daily
  assigned equation, ate, slept, and so forth. I really didn&#39;t know what I was
  doing, and I was lonely and had no friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an adult, Kim deliberately chose pragmatism over abstraction. He studied
civil engineering. He worked as a middle-manager in the Compensation Department
at Chungbuk Development Corporation.</p>
<p>Kim Ung-yong rejected the title of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ung-yong">&#34;failed genius&#34;</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I&#39;m trying to tell people that I&#39;m happy the way I am. But why do people have
  to call my happiness a failure? […] Some think that high IQ people can be
  omnipotent, but that&#39;s not true. Look at me, I don&#39;t have musical talent nor
  do I excel at sports. […] Society shouldn&#39;t judge anyone with unilateral
  standards – everyone has different learning levels, hopes, talents and dreams
  and we should respect that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2014, Kim joined Chungbuk National University as an associate professor. In
2020, he donated 15,000 books from his personal collection to Uijeongbu City for
public use.</p>
<p>But this is still about you. There exist no certificates nor trophies nor titles
that can quench your thirst for permanence. If you worship human intelligence,
210 IQ is not enough. It is only plenty if you let it be.</p></div></div>
