<p>I wrote before tools for personal mythology -but now I am talking about metaphysics. What is mythology? Stories with symbolic (multilayered/infinite meaning) that ground meaning – ie explain the world. </p>



<p>What is metaphysics? It describes or posits the nature of reality – of the world. Metaphysics is theoretical. Theory comes from the greek word for view.  So there is something about metaphysics that is about a point of view. We are empiricists or realists – these are different metaphysical theories.</p>



<p>What is mythology? Mythology for me is concrete. It a story to describe the way things are the way things are. It can be interpreted in different ways. Mythology comes from the world mythos – the greek word for speech.  So there is something about mythology that is about communication and about utterance. </p>



<p>Metaphysics is about sight, Mythology is about sound.  A mythology can produce multiple metaphysics. A metaphysic can provide an impetus to create a mythology. </p>



<p>I go back to what does the spleen produce, what does the heart? Or even the olfactory sense? Here we have ears and eyes. I just imagined <a href="https://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeares-works/titus-andronicus/">Titus Andronicus</a>. Lavinia’s hands and tongue is removed… but she communicates eventually by holding a stick in her hand and drawing in the dirt. </p>



<p>Is mythology about talking or listening? </p>



<p>In tools for my personal metaphysics – I am thinking about the point of view, I am thinking about the structure of the thing, the scaffolding. How to bring things to life… so this is what I am doing as I compile my book of X of the past year. </p>



<ol><li>reflection: photographing parts of my journals </li><li>reading: screenshots of pdfs / readings from the past year </li><li>music (download spotify played songs)</li><li>film (kino, amzn, netflix, youtube, vimeo)</li><li>relationships (zoom converstions, discord conversations, emails, signal, telegraph, calendar) </li></ol>



<p>As I write this I think of all the things left out, puzzles with kids, dishes made, intentions unrealized, fleeting moments, feelings, emotions, weather, plants, laying on the beach with a friend holding hands waving good bye to summer. But I am sure this is still there… The medium of a book imposes its own parameters.</p>
