<tr><td><b>The end is near !
</b></td><td>After a long production run, AMD will accept last orders for the SOC used in our
apu2/3/4/5/6 boards by end of June 2023.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>apu phase-out
</b></td><td>We will do a life-time buy for a quantity of the AMD SOC and some other key 
components. We are willing to schedule customer shipments through end of June 2024.
There is a 26 week lead time on the AMD SOC, expect limited supply until late 2023.
<p>
First ordered, first served. Binding orders may be required for large quantities.

<tr><td><b>New products ?
</b></td><td>Despite having used considerable quantities of AMD processors and Intel NICs, 
we don&#39;t get adequate design support for new projects. In addition, the x86 silicon
currently offered is not very appealing for our niche of passively cooled boards.
After about 20 years of WRAP, ALIX and APU, it is time for me to move on to 
different things.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Thank you !
</b></td><td>I would like to thank all of our customers for their business, and sometimes patience.
