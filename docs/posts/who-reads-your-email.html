the centralization of the internet.  The first post,
discussing diversity of authoritative name servers,

the text &#39;I read your email.&#39;" title="Old BOFH humor; pretty dated, if you ask me:
who wants to read _more_ email?" width="250"/></a>According to <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/how-many-emails-are-sent-per-day/">various</a>
<a href="https://earthweb.com/how-many-emails-are-sent-per-day/">statistics</a>,
there are somewhere around 330 billion emails being
sent every day, approximately 3.82 million per second.
Who reads all these emails?
</p>

<p>Ok, ok, <em>nobody</em> does. Who would want to?
Most of it is spam anyway.  But, given how personal
email is, how much we rely on email for business, how
useful email can be in legal discovery, and, most
importantly, how -- over 40 years after <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc821">RFC821</a>
was published -- we <em>still</em> use a clear text
protocol and have no realistic solution for end-to-end
encryption of this private content... given all that,
who <em>could</em> read that email if they wanted to?
Ah, well, that&#39;s another question altogether.</p>

<p>The <em>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</em> (SMTP)
uses <a href="https://www.netmeister.org/blog/dns-rrs.html#mx"><tt>MX</tt></a>
records in the DNS to identify which server(s) it
should hand the mail off to.  It used to be common for
domain owners to run their own mail server, but it
turns out that doing that well while efficiently
combating spam (both incoming and outgoing), email
abuse, and the ever increasing traffic volume is not
that easy.  And what do we do when things aren&#39;t easy?
We pay somebody else to do it for us.  To the
cloud!</p>

<p>In 2023, chances are that, regardless of the domain
in question, your personal and/or business email is
actually handled by e.g., Google, Microsoft, Yahoo,
Apple, Yandex, or, say, GMX.  But even if those are
your email service provider, it&#39;s also quite likely
that your domain uses another layer in front of
<em>that</em>, which provides spam-, malware-,
filtering, and data-loss prevention (DLP) features.
Popular service providers here include Proofpoint,
Barracuda, Sophos, Trustwave, and some other offerings
from big name companies as well as ones you likely
have never heard of.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s take a look at which of these various
companies are fronting the most domains and could
thus, in theory, anyway, read your email!</p>

<h3><a name="methodology">Methodology</a></h3>

<p>Much like I did when I looked at the <a href="https://www.netmeister.org/blog/nsauth-diversity.html">NS record diversity</a>,
I went through all the gTLD zone files (again leaving
out ccTLDs), extracted all second-level domains, and
then went to work with nothing but my little, trusty
<a href="https://www.isc.org/bind/">bind9</a> caching
resolver running on my personal VPS.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>For each gTLD zone file, I extracted the full list
of domains within that TLD, defined as any unique
label in the zone file with an <a href="https://www.netmeister.org/blog/dns-rrs.html#ns"><tt>NS</tt></a> record.  This yielded a
grand total of approximately 203 million domain names:
&gt; 164 million in <tt>.com</tt> alone, with
all other gTLDs adding up to roughly 39 million domain names.
For each of those domains, I then performed DNS
lookups for its <tt>MX</tt> records, and
a few million queries later I ended up with a whole
bunch of mail server FQDNs.</p>

<p>A single domain may of course have multiple <tt>MX</tt>
records which may or may not be in the same
domain (which itself may or may not be within the
original domain):</p>

<div><pre>$ dig +short mx netmeister.org           # &lt;--+ 1 MX
50 panix.netmeister.org.                 # &lt;--+ within the same domain

$ dig +short mx akamai.com               # &lt;--+ 4 MX
20 mx0b-00190b01.pphosted.com.           #    |
10 mxa-00190b01.gslb.pphosted.com.       #    | all in a different domain
10 mxb-00190b01.gslb.pphosted.com.       #    |
20 mx0a-00190b01.pphosted.com.           # &lt;--+

$ dig +short mx twitter.com              # &lt;--+ 5 MX
30 ASPMX3.GOOGLEMAIL.com.                #    + in two different domains
20 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.              #    | (owned by the same org)
10 aspmx.l.google.com.                   #    |
30 ASPMX2.GOOGLEMAIL.com.                #    +
20 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.              # &lt;--+

$ dig +short mx whynot.coffee            # &lt;--+ 4 MX
10 mailin.mx-hub.cz.                     #    | in four different domains
10 mailin.mx-hub.eu.                     #    | in four different TLDs
10 mailin.mx-hub.sk.                     #    |
10 mailin.mx-hub.net.                    # &lt;--+
$ </pre></div>

<p> So we need to flatten the data a bit and reduce
the individual <tt>MX</tt> servers to their second-level
domain.  With the help of <a href="https://mstdn.social/@jschauma/109825820807091365">some
perl</a> and the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/">Public Suffix
List</a>, I mapped the approximately 30 million unique <tt>MX</tt>
servers listed for the 203 million domains into around 21 million
second-level domains.</p>

<p>So... who <em>does</em> <s>read</s> host everybody&#39;s email?</p>

<h3><a name="mx">Stats by MX</a></h3>

<h4><a name="none">No MX</a></h4>

<p> As noted above, I found approximately 30 million unique
mail servers, but of course not every domain
<em>has</em> an <tt>MX</tt> record.  In
that case, SMTP assumes an &#34;implicit <tt>MX</tt>&#34; and
attempts to deliver the mail to the IP address (if
any) of the bare domain name.</p>

<p>As it turns out, no explicit <tt>MX</tt> record is indeed the most widely
found configuration: almost 119 million domains (58%
of all domains) are lacking any such resource record.
Of those, 76 million (64%) do have an IP address and
thus <em>could</em> at least theoretically receive
mail; reversing those IP addresses again, we note that
28.8 million are AWS IPs (in the <tt>amazonaws.com.</tt>, <tt>awsglobalaccelerator.com.</tt>, and <tt>cloudfront.net.</tt> domains), 18 million
Google&#39;s (<tt>1e100.net.</tt> and <tt>googleusercontent.com.</tt>; <tt>34.102.136.180</tt> is used by 12.8
million domains alone), and 7.3 million Wix&#39;s (<tt>wixsite.com</tt>).</p>

<p>That leaves around 42 million domains that do not
have any means of accepting mail simply by not having
either an <tt>MX</tt> record, nor an IP
address.  However, there are other ways that a domain
owner may signal that it does not accept mail: 1.5
million (or 0.7% of all) domains have their <tt>MX</tt> set to <tt>localhost</tt> (and 425 to <tt>localhost.localdomain</tt>), which of
course is a bit janky a way of telling folks not to
bother you.  Because this isn&#39;t quite ideal, we now
have a much better way of expressing the fact that
a domain does not want any mail: the <em>&#34;Null MX&#34;
No Service Resource Record</em>, specified in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7505">RFC7505</a>.
That is, simply set an <tt>MX</tt> record
with a preference number of <tt>0</tt>
and a zero-length label (i.e., <tt>.</tt>):</p>

<div><pre>$ host -t mx livemediastreaming.com
livemediastreaming.com mail is handled by 0 .
$ </pre></div>

<p>This approach appears to be marginally more popular
than using <tt>localhost</tt>: around 2
million or just about 1% of all domains have a Null MX
record set.  (That approach also has the advantage
that it can help in combating impersonation without
having to specify an <a href="https://www.netmeister.org/blog/spf.html">SPF
policy</a>: a receiving mail server can reject mail
upon encountering an undeliverable <tt>MailFrom</tt>/<tt>From</tt>
address.)</p>

<p>So all in all, just about 46 million domains or
around 23% of all domains do not have any way of
getting mail.</p>

<h4><a name="mx-numbers">Number of MX Records</a></h4>

<p> Now let&#39;s take a look at the ~40% (approximately
81 million) of domains <em>with</em> <tt>MX</tt> records.  Most domains have
between one and five mail exchange records, but of
course there are outliers: 464 domains have more
than ten <tt>MX</tt> records, 28 more
than 20, and four domains have over 100!  For example, the ever
so aptly named <tt>everymailbox.com</tt>
domain has 398 <tt>MX</tt> records, <tt>whiteinbox.net</tt> has 253, and <tt>rm02.net</tt> has 235.  All of these <tt>MX</tt> records have the same priority,
suggesting they are trying to aim for some DNS
round-robin load balancing here.</p>

<p><tt>gaodong.com</tt> is another
outlier: 123 <tt>MX</tt> records with 117
distinct priorities, similar to <tt>connectingdonors.net</tt> with 59 records
with unique priorities from 1 to 58.</p>

<p>And then there are domains that spread their <tt>MX</tt> records across multiple
second-level domains, although some of them are
clearly misconfigured and including what appear to be
non-fqdn names as well as some that simply don&#39;t
resolve at all:</p>

<div><pre>$ host -t mx trustedomain.com
trustedomain.com mail is handled by 10 imtat4.         # these appear to be
trustedomain.com mail is handled by 5 imta6.           # non-fqdn names under
trustedomain.com mail is handled by 5 imta21.          # the trustedomain.com domain
[... 40 more records like that ...]
$ host -t mx dabafunk.xyz
dabafunk.xyz mail is handled by 10 mail.dabafunk.xyz.
dabafunk.xyz mail is handled by 0 smtp.dabafunk.xyz.
dabafunk.xyz mail is handled by 2 mail.bhargo.         # similarly, some are non-fqdn
dabafunk.xyz mail is handled by 1 smtp.wesak.
dabafunk.xyz mail is handled by 1 smtp.maitreya.
dabafunk.xyz mail is handled by 1 smtp.shamballa.
dabafunk.xyz mail is handled by 2 mail.wesak.          # but others don&#39;t resolve
dabafunk.xyz mail is handled by 1 smtp.bhargo.
dabafunk.xyz mail is handled by 2 mail.maitreya.
$ </pre></div>

<p>And my favorite: <tt>moshelasky.net</tt>, which set <tt>MX</tt> records for a number of
completely unrelated and necessarily mutually
exclusive big name domains, basically saying &#34;go give
my mail to Cisco, and if that doesn&#39;t work out, try
Microsoft, Intel, Google, Yahoo... whatever&#34;:</p>

<div><pre>$ host -t mx moshelasky.net
moshelasky.net mail is handled by 70 mail.facebook.com.
moshelasky.net mail is handled by 100 mail.thunderbird.com.
moshelasky.net mail is handled by 100 mail.yahoo.com.

<h4><a name="by-mx">Valid MX Records</a></h4>

<p> But ok, let&#39;s look at the domains with reasonable
<tt>MX</tt> records: In the 30 million unique
servers listed, we expect to see several of the
popular email and hosting providers&#39; mail servers, but
of course less popular domains will have their own <tt>MX</tt> records that are likely to be
unique.  In fact, almost 98% of all domains have a
globally unique mail server, making only a single
appearance.  Of the other 380K mail servers, around 2K
appear more than 1,000 times.  The top 20 most
frequently used mail servers here are:</p>

<p>You can see an obvious trend here: Google&#39;s mail
servers are rather popular (although not the
<em>most</em> popular), and of course chances are that
domains that have e.g., <tt>alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.</tt> as one <tt>MX</tt> will likely have also <tt>alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.</tt> as a second
record.  This suggests that we can gain more insights
by reducing them to their domain name:</p>

<h4><a name="by-domain">MX Record Domains</a></h4>

<p>To better understand who the operators
of these mail servers are, I flattened the data
such that a domain that contains <tt>MX</tt> records pointing to, say, <tt>aspmx.l.google.com.</tt>, <tt>alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.</tt>, and <tt>smtp.secureserver.net.</tt> would be
counted once each for the domains <tt>google.com</tt> and <tt>secureserver.net.</tt>.</p>

<p>This breaks down our data set to 21 million unique
domains, and the top 20 domains in which we find most
<tt>MX</tt> records are:</p>



<p>
Obviously we can combine some of the domains by
company or organization to better reflect the
concentration of the mail servers.  With that, we find
that Google takes the lion&#39;s share of domains with
about 34%, GoDaddy around 14%, Namecheap 13.5%, and
Microsoft trailing behind with about 4.7%<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>:
</p>

<p><img src="https://www.netmeister.org/blog/images/mx-domains.png" alt="Pie chart showing the
distribution of the top MX domains listed in the
table above by organization"/></p>

<p>To note: All of this is for <em>all</em> generic
second-level domains but <em>excluding</em>
country-code TLDs.  Necessarily, this skews the
findings a bit, as we&#39;d expect e.g., European
countries to use non-American service providers.</p>

<p>Spot-checking 100,000 domains each from <tt>.ch</tt>, <tt>.fr</tt>, and
<tt>.se</tt> -- three of the only 17
ccTLD zone files / domain name listings I was able to
access -- shows OVH and Gandi ahead of Google in <tt>.fr</tt>, Hostpoint AG and Infomaniak in
the top 3 in <tt>.ch</tt>, and the
Swedish One.com not surprisingly taking the top spot
in <tt>.se</tt>, but a full analysis of
all ccTLD zones would obviously be needed to get a
complete view.</p>

<h3><a name="top1m">Stats for Top 1M Domains</a></h3>

<p>Looking at <em>all</em> domains tells us which mail
servers are listed most frequently, but that of course
includes hundreds of thousands if not millions of
parked domains, spam domains, one-time or dormant
domains etc.  So let&#39;s instead look at the Tranco <a href="https://tranco-list.eu/">Top 1 Million</a>
list and see if our distribution changes.</p>

<p>For those 1 million domains, we find around 433K
distinct <tt>MX</tt> servers in 230K
domains.  The top 20 mail server domains there are
slightly different from those for <em>all</em>
domains:</p>



<p><img src="https://www.netmeister.org/blog/images/mx-domains-top1m.png" alt="Pie chart showing the
distribution of the top 1M domains&#39; mail servers listed in the
table above"/></p>

<p>We observe that amongst the top 1M domains, many
outsource mail not just to the big providers (Google
and Microsoft together account for 60% of all!), but
often add another layer of email protection via
different, more specialized service provides such as
Proofpoint, Barracuda Networks, or Cisco / IronPort.
Those may then well also hand the mail to e.g.,
Google or Microsoft, further increasing their share,
but that remains opaque to us from the outside.</p>

<h3><a name="summary">Summary</a></h3>

<p>In summary, some of the information were we able to
pull out of our <tt>MX</tt> data
collection includes:</p>

<ul>

<li>58% of all domains (119 million) have no <tt>MX</tt> record (42 million of those have no IP)</li>

<li>1% of all domains (~2 million) use a RFC7505 &#34;Null MX&#34;  (<tt>0 .</tt>)</li>

<li>0.7% of all domains (~1.5 million) use <tt>localhost</tt></li>

<li>40% of all domains (81 million) have an <tt>MX</tt> record, yielding
  around 30 million unique records in 21 million unique domains</li>

<li>98% of those are unique, and around 380K mail servers a used
    by more than one domain</li>

<li>~2,000 mail servers are used by &gt;1,000 domains each;
    the most frequently used <tt>MX</tt> records are GoDaddy&#39;s <tt>mailstore1.secureserver.net.</tt> and <tt>smtp.secureserver.net.</tt> (used by 10.6 million domains each) and Google&#39;s <tt>aspmx.l.google.com.</tt> (used by 9.6 million domains)</li>

<li>34% of all domains (53.7 million) use one of Google&#39;s mail servers,
  14% (22.5 million) one of GoDaddy&#39;s, 13.5% (~21.3 million) one of Namecheap&#39;s</li>

<li>for the Top 1M domains, over 60% use Google&#39;s (41%) and Microsoft&#39;s (20%) mail servers</li>

<li>many mail protection services dominate the remainder</li>
</ul>


<p>So all in all, the answer to the question of who can
read your email pretty much boils down to -- yep --
&#34;Google and Microsoft&#34;.  Even if <em>your</em> domain
doesn&#39;t use one of their mail servers, chances are
that whoever you are sending mail <em>to</em>
does.</p>

<p> To be fair: these companies are going to be doing
a <em>much</em> better job at running and securing
your email than you are, and outsourcing this critical
functionality often makes good sense.  And yet,
this is another example of the continuously increasing
centralization of the internet.  Our businesses just
like our personal online lives are concentrated in the
hands of just a few companies.</p>
