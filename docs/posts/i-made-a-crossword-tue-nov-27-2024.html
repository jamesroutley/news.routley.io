    <h1>I Made a Crossword! (Tue. Nov 27, 2024)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we&#39;re releasing DeepThought-8B, a small, capable AI reasoning model built on LLaMA-3.1 8B. This release represents our first step toward making AI reasoning more transparent and controllable, while demonstrating that smaller, more efficient models can achieve sophisticated reasoning capabilities that rival models of much larger scales. DeepThought-8B unlocks test-time compute scaling during inference for all- taking as many reasoning steps as needed to solve complex problems.</p></div></div>
