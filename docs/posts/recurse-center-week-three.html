<p>This post is about my third week at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>.</p>

<h2 id="functional-programming-and-clojure">Functional Programming and Clojure</h2>

<p>During this week, I continued reading Clojure for the Brave and True, and completed the next two chapters (<a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/read-and-eval/">Clojure Alchemy: Reading, Evaluation, and Macros</a>, and <a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/writing-macros/">Writing Macros</a>). Reading about how Clojure syntax is read and evaluated was very interesting! It reminded me of my first project, <a href="https://github.com/oitee/crisp">Crisp: a simple Lisp interpretor</a>.</p>

<p>During the previous week, while reading Brave Clojure’s 4th and 5th chapters, I was briefly introduced to some of the key tenets of functional programming. I found these concepts very fascinating. This week, I spent a considerable amount of time reading about them. While I would like to write a separate post on my findings, here are some of the points I have taken on my notebook:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Functional programming is characterized by its use of pure functions.</li>
  <li>A pure function is one that has no side effects.</li>
  <li>The values evaluated by a pure function are solely dependent on its arguments. The return value for a given set of arguments, will always be the same, irrespective of the number of times the function is called or when it is being invoked. This makes it easier to <a href="https://purelyfunctional.tv/issues/purelyfunctional-tv-newsletter-340-fewer-side-effects-is-better-than-more/">do parallel programming, testing, and using higher-order functions</a></li>
  <li>Because of their deterministic nature, a pure function can be replaced with its return value, in an expression (referential transparency)</li>
  <li>The use of impure functions is not prohibited. But as a functional programmer, it is important to be <a href="https://twitter.com/ericnormand/status/1384860792013705218?s=20">wary of using side effects</a>.</li>
  <li>As changing the value of a data-structure can cause side effects, functional programming emphasizes the use of immutable data-structures.</li>
  <li>As we need to need to <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/functional-programming-recursion">change the state of local variables</a> to run a loop, recursion should be preferred over loops</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="remindme-my-first-clojure-app">RemindMe: My First Clojure App</h2>

<p>Now that I was getting slightly familiar with the world of Clojure, I thought it would be the perfect time to embark on a journey to build my very first app using Clojure. I decided to build an online version of flash cards, called <strong>RemindMe</strong>.</p>

<p>Given that it would be my first project in Clojure, I thought it would be useful to first build the app using JavaScript, the language I am most familiar with.</p>

<p>So, I spent a day writing the server-side logic of <strong>RemindMe</strong>, using Node.js. I then proceeded to build the front-end part of the project. To implement the front-end part, I used the Bootstrap framework. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sosXZsdy-s&amp;">Bootstrap tutorial</a> was very helpful, to get started. (<em>Side note: Long after finishing the front-end part, I realized that the hamburger menu on the navigation bar is not working on a mobile display. I’ll need to fix this; would love to pair with anyone who is good with Bootstrap/CSS!</em>).</p>

<p>The Node.js version of RemindMe is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/oitee/remind-me">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>After completing the app in Node.js, I proceeded to re-implement the backend of RemindMe, using Clojure. I used the Ring framework and it’s jetty-adaptor to build my web service. I chose Compojure as a routing library, for better handling of requests.</p>

<p><strong>RemindMe is deployed here:</strong> <a href="https://remind.otee.dev">https://remind.otee.dev</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a detailed account of how I built RemindMe, using Clojure, Ring and Compojure: <a href="https://otee.dev/2022/01/25/clojure-backend-using-ring-jetty-compojure.html">https://otee.dev/2022/01/25/clojure-backend-using-ring-jetty-compojure.html</a></p>
