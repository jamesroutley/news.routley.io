    <h1>Ask HN: Why aren&#39;t code diagram generating tools more common?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>When I&#39;m trying to get familiar with a new codebase it often takes me a long time to build a proper mental model of the whole system. Even with my own projects, it&#39;s easy to lose track of all the components and their interactions since they&#39;re constantly changing, and making hand-drawn diagrams is time consuming.<p>So my questions are:</p><p>- Why isn&#39;t diagram generation automated as part of the build process (UML or otherwise)?</p><p>- Why aren&#39;t code visualization tools more popular? The options out there seem outdated</p><p>- Would you want to use these tools? What would be your ideal tool?</p><p>Edit: looks like this is a duplicate question
