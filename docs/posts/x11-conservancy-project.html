    <h1>X11 Conservancy Project</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
		
		

		<p>The X11 Conservancy Project (X11CP) pulls together the disparate set of
		programs which were being written between the very late 80s, and early 90s --
		usually for Unix and Linux.</p>

		<p>Before the establishment of code hosting services, and search engines,
		applications which were being developed were largely uncoordinated.  With only
		FTP servers for public file sharing, knowing which applications existed and
		for which purposes became harder to discover.  Because of this, some
		applications ended up being duplicated in what they did, but also, the scope
		and purpose of that application ended up being niche and specific.</p>

		<p>To help try and address this disparity, the 
		[Linux Software Map](https://xteddy.org/lsm) was created to pull together a
		central resource of known software for people to query and therefore use
		themselves.</p>

		<p>As the Internet expanded and Linux distributions became established, certain
		FTP sites were largely used to host some of the more established programs, as
		well as those found in the LSM.  Some of those providers were:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/sunsite/sunsiteworld.html">Sunsite</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://www.nic.funet.fi/">funet</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/">ibiblio</a>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Now though, with the rise of search engines and software hubs, it&#39;s never been
		easier to find software and know where to look.</p>

		<p>But the early dawn of free software, especially around applications written
		for X11, using Motif and XT and other widget libraries has now mostly been
		consigned to obscurity.</p>

		<p>With X11 itself now under threat of no longer being developed in favour of
		Wayland, these applications are going to be harder to run and be
		discovered.</p>

		<p>Hence, the X11CP is designed to be a central place for hosting the sources of
		these applications, and to showcase their unique history and properties.  In
		keeping this software active, it will help keep an important historical point
		alive.</p>

		<h2>In The Media</h2>
		<p>There are a series of <a href="https://bsd.network/tags/x11cp">posts on Mastodon</a> with the
		<i>#x11cp</i> tag which talk about different applications
		found within this project.</p>

		<p>The following applications are hereby supported by the
		X11CP in that they should compile and work on Linux/BSD.</p>

		<h2>XTartan</h2>
		<a href="https://codeberg.org/x11cp/x11cp/src/branch/main/src/xtartan">[SOURCE]</a>
		<p>XTartan, written by Joseph Shelby in December, 1995, is an
		application which draws different Scottish tartan patterns.
		This include being able to draw to the root window as well as
		its own window.</p>

		<p>Pressing <i>space bar</i> cycles through the available
		tartans.</p>
