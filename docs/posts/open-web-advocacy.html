                            <strong>OWA (Open Web Advocacy)</strong> is a group of software engineers from all over the world who have come together to advocate for the future of the open web by providing regulators, legislators and policy makers the
                            intricate technical details that they need to understand the major anti-competitive issues in our industry and how to solve them.

                        </header>

                        <p>
                            The <strong>entire future of Application Development</strong> is at stake. Without regulatory or legislative change, we risk losing a universal, free and open, write once, deploy anywhere, application distribution and deployment
                            system which will dramatically lower costs for businesses and consumers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Without these changes, funding will shift to proprietary ecosystems and gatekeepers can extract heavy taxes. It will lock in their control and reduce innovation for mobile apps for many years to come.

                        <p><strong>Apple&#39;s ban of third party browsers</strong> on iOS is deeply anti-competitive, starves the Safari/WebKit team of funding and has stalled innovation for the past 10 years and prevented Web Apps from taking off on mobile.

                            <strong>Web Apps need to become just Apps.</strong> Apps built with the free and open web need equal treatment and integration. Closed and heavily taxed proprietary ecosystems should not receive any preference.

                    <p>
                        (Update 1 March 22) We didn‘t initially sign this document for two reasons: firstly, we want discussion to be about the <strong>facts</strong>, not personalities. Secondly, some of our livelihoods depend on Apple allowing our products in the App Store. Here
                        are some of our members who are comfortable being named, to show we are “real people” and not Google/ Mozilla/ Microsoft PR.

                    <p>
                        None of the big companies were advocating for the open web and web apps, that&#39;s why we rely on unpaid, volunteer
                        time from software engineers.  We have not received any funding, and are not working on behalf of any major company. 
                    </p>
