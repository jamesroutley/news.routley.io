          <div><div><p>In part that’s because the wood has been a guiding light from which I have taken inspiration. Ancient meadows which have seen industry come and go, not to mention a railway, and yet have come back strongly to thrive again. I’m not exactly ancient, but after 18 months of injections, a stem cells transplant, chemotherapy and loads more, I am determined to come back as strongly as I possibly can.</p>
<p>There is something else here too: the power of humanity to carry us through the darkest of times. Whenever I see a volunteer in the wood, or take a newly fenced off path, I am humbled by what has been done for me and all those who use the wood to allow us to enjoy this life-affirming place. </p>
<p>The same is true of my experience of cancer. The support of so many people, many of them strangers who have become new friends, has perversely made it an experience within which I have found deep nourishment and strength. Just as the autumn colours, the muddy dips and the snow covered paths of the Great North Wood have lifted my soul, so has the friendship and support I have found in the depths of cancer treatment. </p>

          <div><p>The song I have written with the wonderful songwriter James Grant, formerly of the band Love and Money as well being an accomplished solo artist, tries to capture the importance of the wood in my cancer journey, and the way it has provided a refuge during some of the most difficult times in my life, while also giving me a sense of the possibility of renewal out of the nightmare of cancer. The music is down to James, while we wrote the words together: an experience which was in itself one of the most enriching and inspiring of my life.</p></div>
