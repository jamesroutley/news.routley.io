                    <section data-title="Introduction"><div id="Sec1-section"><h2 id="Sec1">Introduction</h2><div id="Sec1-content"><p>This article delves into the perplexing enigma surrounding the Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 (MH370) by conducting an in-depth analysis of previous aircraft crashes. Out of about two decades of hydroacoustic data available from the CTBTO, a comprehensive study was undertaken of 100 hours of data identified as having the potential for containing signals pertaining to acoustic signatures of aircraft crashing into the sea. Ten historical aircraft accidents that occurred in open sea locations were selected for this study. Figures <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig1">1</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig2">2</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig3">3</a> depict maps illustrating the positions of these aircraft and their respective distances (ranging from 2211 to 4695 km) and their bearings (directions) relative to the hydroacoustic stations. Further background information on each crash is provided in the supplementary material <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#MOESM1">S1</a>. Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig1">1</a> showcases the impact locations of three aircraft, namely F-35a, Transair Flight 810, and Asiana Flight 991, along with their distances from the northern and southern parts of the hydroacoustic station at Wake Island, stations H11N and H11S, in the Pacific Ocean. Notably, each hydroacoustic station consists of three hydrophones arranged in a triangular configuration with distances of a few kilometres between them. By calculating the time differences in signal arrival, it is possible to determine the bearing of the signal (see “<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Sec7">Methods</a>”). In Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig2">2</a>, the impact locations of five aircrafts are depicted, all of which were recorded at hydroacoustic stations in the Indian Ocean, namely Diego Garcia (H08S and H08N) and Cape Leeuwin (H01W). Yemenia Flight 626 was recorded at both H08S and H08N, while AB Aviation Flight 1103 and Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 were recorded at H08S. Air Asia Flight 8501 was recorded at H01W, and Lion Air Flight 904 was recorded on both H01W and H08S, providing a rare opportunity to study signal variations due to propagation through land. Low-frequency acoustic signals coupling to land and subsequently to the ocean have been reasonably well-documented<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Kosuga, M.

A consistent observation in this study, across all aircraft incidents, is the detection of acoustic signals even at distances of thousands of kilometres from the hydrophones.</p><p>The spectrograms of aircraft F-35a exhibit a distinctive, sharp, and rapid (6 s) signal following the supersonic impact (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig4">4</a>a).

A similar pattern is observed in the case of Yemenia Flight 626, also recorded at two stations, H08N and H08S (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig4">4</a>b), although the signal appears fainter compared to F-35a, likely due to a less energetic impact. It is worth noting that the background noise at H08S is particularly high, posing a challenge for isolating the signal of interest. Conversely, H08N displays two subsequent signals that appear to be local events. For Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig4">4</a>c), data was only available at H08S within the specified time window. Despite the significant distance from the hydrophone station, the signal of interest is sharp and clear.</p><p>The signal associated with Air France Flight 447 (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig5">5</a>a) is also short, but due to relatively high background noise between 18 and 28 Hz, the signal appears faint. It is important to emphasise that Flight 447 experienced a high-impact event, as evidenced by the pressure values reaching 75% of that observed for F-35a, even over a distance of 2200 km. Note that the above mentioned flights had powerful impacts, some due to aerodynamic stall prior to crashing.</p><p>The incident involving Transair Flight 810 is noteworthy as data is available from both H11N and H11S (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig5">5</a>b), and there appears to be a double signal, potentially indicating a ditching event, an engine that was detached, or signal arrival from different locations. The duration of the signal is longer compared to previous cases, suggesting either signal dispersion (When sound propagates through the ocean, it encounters variations in water temperature, pressure, and salinity. These environmental factors can lead to changes in the speed of sound at different depths and locations. As a result, different frequency components of a sound signal may travel at different speeds, causing the signal to spread out or disperse over time. This phenomenon is known as dispersion.) or an extended impact time due to ditching. A similar observation, with more pronounced dispersion indicated by white arrows, is noticed in the case of Lion Air Flight 904 (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig5">5</a>c). The associated signals, within the expected time windows, were recorded at two distant stations, namely H01W and H08S. Notably, station H08S is nearly twice the distance from the incident location, resulting in stronger signal dispersion. The shape and arrival time of the signal at H01W indicate that it primarily travelled through water, although the bearing suggests a landward direction. The high pressure recorded at H01W indicates that the signal might be associated with a different event, possibly local, especially considering reports of Lion Air Flight 904’s relatively low-impact crash. It is also noteworthy that approximately 8 min later, two faint signals (not shown in the figure) were observed from feasible bearings, indicating travelling predominantly in the water layer.</p><p>In the final set of plots, Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig6">6</a>, signal dispersion is most pronounced. Panels (a), (b), and (c) of Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig6">6</a> present signal recordings associated with aircraft incidents involving AB Aviation Flight 1103 (recorded at H08S), Air Asia Flight 8501 (recorded at H01W), and Asiana Flight 991 (recorded at both H11N and H11S). Nevertheless, the differences in the mode of crash is rather pronounced. The signal in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig6">6</a>b is distorted with noise (possibly due to airgun shots as shown in Figs. 3(a) and 4(c) of Ref.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Schwardt, M. et al.

AB 1103 is a small aeroplane, whereas Asiana 991 (a heavy cargo aeroplane) and Air Asia 8501 had a much more impactful crash.</p><p>In summary, the analysis of the recorded signals from past aircraft incidents reveals three different types of acoustic signature. The first type is characterised by distinct and rapid signals following energetic impacts, whereas the second type includes signals with longer impact time. The third type involves signals with higher uncertainty around them, due to multiple factors such as large distances crossing through land and unknown modes of impact (e.g., nose, main body, or wings first). However, the pressure signatures radiating during a high energy impact crash were found to be observable even at a few thousands kilometres away. The effect of signal travelling through land is discussed in the following note considering the case of ARA San Juan Submarine.</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-4" data-title="Figure 4"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig4" data-test="figure-caption-text">Figure 4</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1/figures/4" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-60529-1/MediaObjects/41598_2024_60529_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp"/><img aria-describedby="Fig4" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-60529-1/MediaObjects/41598_2024_60529_Fig4_HTML.png" alt="figure 4" loading="lazy" width="685" height="743"/></picture></a></div><p>Spectrogram (left) and pressure time series (right) of: (<b>a</b>) F-35a; (<b>b</b>) Yemenia Flight 626; and (<b>c</b>) Sriwijaya Air Flight 182.

Specifically, Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig7">7</a> presents spectrogram and pressure time series of acoustic waves generated by explosions in the submarine that were observed not only at H10 and H04 stations that have direct water connection with the location of the submarine (which is in agreement with Fig. 2 of Ref.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Vergoz, J. et al.

This observation highlights the effectiveness of employing hydrophones to capture events in the ocean beyond current convention, namely when signals cross through lands. However, the higher frequencies of the signal attenuate due to scattering absorption in the elastic layer when a critical depth is reached. This observation is in agreement with acoustic-gravity wave theory<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="Eyov, E., Klar, A., Kadri, U. &amp; Stiassnie, M.

It is noticed even though H03S is much closer to the event location compared to the other two stations, i.e., about one third the distance to H10N and one quarter the distance to H04S, yet the pressure signal recorded at H03S is 21% of H04S and 11% of H10N. Thus, radiation through large distances in land and complex topography can significantly reduce the pressure signature.</p><p>Moreover, the shorter propagation path in terms of duration, not necessarily the shortest distance, experiences less attenuation during transmission, resulting in a greater concentration of acoustic energy. The cyan curve in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig3">3</a> qualitatively indicates the path the acoustic signals would travel through land, which minimises the duration of the journey as it optimises travelling in the solid earth (much higher speed) than in the water. Specifically, with an average speed of 3550 m/s travelling roughly 1900 km <span>\(\pm 100\)</span> km, and an average speed of 1480 m/s travelling about 330 km <span>\(\pm 100\)</span> km, it takes a total time of between 12 and 13.5 min to reach H03S. This choice of shortest time path results in a different relative bearing, i.e., 105.6<span>\(^{\circ }\)</span>, which is in agreement with the actual arrival direction at H03S (with an uncertainty of 0.5<span>\(^{\circ }\)</span>), as opposed to the expected 135.5<span>\(^{\circ }\)</span>, in case of shortest distance or 173<span>\(^{\circ }\)</span> considering the acoustic signals travelling only in the water.</p><p>Further support of the argument above can be demonstrated by examining an event that took place in close proximity to the site of the submarine’s explosion. On December 1, 2017, 2 weeks after the ARA Juan submarine vanished, the Argentine Navy dropped a calibration grenade into the sea within the vicinity of the submarine’s last known location. Comparing the temporal and spectral features of both events helps confirming the impulsive nature of the San Juan event, as rigorously done by Ref.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Vergoz, J. et al.

Despite an extensive multinational search effort, the whereabouts of the aircraft and the fate of its 239 passengers and crew remain shrouded in uncertainty. To delve into the perplexing enigma surrounding MH370, attention is focused on Southern Indian Ocean, which is, arguably, associated with the final stage of the journey, searching for signals that were generated near the 7th arc (last communication with the satellite - Inmarsat) following the official search recommendations. In addition, data associated with the disappearance stage of the flight around the time of the last communication, i.e., in the Gulf of Thailand, was analysed in general to check for any unusual signals. No signals of interest were found to be associated with the early disappearance stage (see supplementary material <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#MOESM1">S1</a>).</p><h3 id="Sec5">The final search stage: southern Indian Ocean</h3><p>According to the official search team, data that emerged later on from the International Maritime Satellite Organization (Inmarsat) alongside calculations by Boeing search teams concluded that the MH370 crash impact has to be in the Indian Ocean at the vicinity of the last handshake at 00:19:29 UTC between Inmarsat and MH370, known as the 7th arc<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="AE-2014-054: Technical assistance to the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia in support of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 on 7 March 2014 UTC.

Moreover, it has been concluded that during the last minutes of the flight the aircraft was on autopilot at regular altitude of 36,000 ft when the two engines had subsequently flamed off, following fuel being exhausted, which caused the aircraft go through a spiral stall.

Provided all these information not only that the time window and bearing being sought are very narrow, but one expects a significant signal to appear on both H01W and H08S (note that H04 was not operational during that time, and until 2017). The distance from the 7th arc to H01W is about 1600 km, which is less than three quarters the distance of Air France Flight 447 relative to H10S (the signal-to-hydrophone distance analysed); and the distance to H08S is around 3700 km, still within the average distance of the other studied cases.</p><p>A number of acoustic signals were analysed previously in several studies, in particular Refs.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Dall’Osto, D.

However, following the recommendations by the official investigation the signal of interest that is associated with the impact has to occur around the 7th arc, both in time and location. Around 00:30 UTC there are a few repeating signals (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig9">9</a>a) followed by no observed signals (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig9">9</a>b), around the requested time window.

The first signal has a bearing of <span>\(57^{\circ }\)</span> and thus cannot be related to MH370, but the second, which was recorded at 00:52 UTC at H01W, arrives from a plausible direction, i.e., <span>\(306^{\circ }\)</span>. Notably, the transect from the 7th arc to H01W has no bathymetric irregularities (see Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig15">15</a>c in “<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Sec7">Methods</a>”), and thus minimum loss of energy is expected due to scattering.

Nonetheless, it is implausible to imagine that a significant crash of an aircraft on the ocean surface would fail to generate a discernible pressure signature, even at distant hydrophones, let alone those in closer proximity. The official investigation of MH370 supports the conclusion that a substantial crash should have taken place near the 7th arc<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="AE-2014-054: Technical assistance to the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia in support of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 on 7 March 2014 UTC.

In this case, the acoustic signal would have travelled approximately 1600 km to reach the nearest hydrophone station (H01W), a considerably shorter distance than any other acoustic signal analysed here. An aircraft with a mass of 200 tons impacting the water surface at a velocity of 200 m/s possesses a kinetic energy of 4 GJ, equivalent to 956 kg of TNT or an earthquake of magnitude 3.2. Considering half that velocity, the released energy would still be large, i.e., 1 GJ, equivalent to 239 kg of TNT or an earthquake of magnitude 2.8. Even with a significantly lower impact velocity of 30 m/s, the resulting energy release would be 89 MJ, equivalent to 21 kg of TNT or an earthquake of magnitude 2.1. Evidently, such earthquakes can be detected by distant hydrophones, just as the M 2.7 earthquake (see Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig2">2</a> for the location of the earthquake on the map; and Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig17">17</a> in “<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Sec7">Methods</a>” for the bearing). Therefore, it is highly unlikely for MH370 to have crashed near the 7th arc without leaving a discernible acoustic signature. Within the constraints imposed by the official search team, only one signal (bearing <span>\(306^{\circ }\)</span>) has been identified at H01W, suggesting a potential impact location (see “<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Sec7">Methods</a>”), as illustrated in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig10">10</a>. However, this same signal was not observed at H08S.

If the received signals from the explosions exhibit comparable pressure amplitudes to that of the signal of interest, that would support the notion that the identified signal should be a focal point in future search efforts. Conversely, if the signals received on both H01W and H08S are significantly stronger than the signal of interest discussed here, it would necessitate further analysis of the signals from both stations. This may also warrant a reassessment of the data that led to the determination of the 7th arc, allowing for the consideration of new scenarios consistent with the updated findings. Additionally, variations in the strength of recorded signals could offer insights into the underlying conditions influencing such variability, potentially enabling a more refined localisation of potential impact areas based on specific terrains and associated transects.</p><p>It is important to note that the present study does not definitively pinpoint the impact location of MH370. However, it significantly enhances our understanding of the acoustic signals associated with aircraft crashes at sea in general. It narrows down the signals of interest and their respective locations, and importantly, it highlights the effectiveness of hydrophones in classifying and detecting signals even after they have travelled long distances, including over land. It is hoped that these practical suggestions will inspire relevant authorities to take the next significant steps towards unraveling the greatest aviation mystery of all time.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Methods"><div id="Sec7-section"><h2 id="Sec7">Methods</h2><div id="Sec7-content"><h3 id="Sec8">Analysis approach</h3><p>Conducting a detailed analysis of aeroplane crashes in the ocean is challenging due to the limited number of occurrences. Despite the scarcity of data, the unique and energetic nature of such events, coupled with a relatively low frequency of occurrence of signals with similar characteristics, presents an opportunity for insightful analysis. For instance, the highest relevant signal frequency observed in the analysis was four signals in 10 min, in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig9">9</a>a, highlighting a constrained set of possibilities. Considering the 10-min window and allowing for a 2<span>\(^{\circ }\)</span> uncertainty in the bearing (which is much larger than the maximum deviation), the probability of a signal occurring by chance, unrelated to the event, is less than 3%. This high level of confidence (97%) in the signal’s relevance to the event arises from the limited occurrences and distinctive characteristics of the signals. Even with a broader 20-min window, featuring eight signals and a more lenient 5<span>\(^{\circ }\)</span> bearing uncertainty, the probability of the signal being unrelated to the event remains below 12%. However, it is acknowledged that the disadvantage of this approach emerges when the impact location is unknown, leading to an increased degree in bearing uncertainty.</p><p>It is worth noting that in the calculation of the acoustic speed, although average speeds can be calculated with precision, the methodology employed here takes a broader perspective. Rather than focusing solely on accuracy, the approach involves exploring the entire spectrum of possibilities, even if it means incorporating seemingly irrelevant signals. This ensures that no potential signal of interest is inadvertently overlooked. Therefore, prior to diving into the sufficient conditions to correlate the signal with the incident, the necessary conditions are first examined. This approach is chosen due to the limited number of signals that meet the necessary conditions as described above.</p><h3 id="Sec9">Signal processing and bearing calculation</h3><p>Signals from past aircraft crashes were presented around the middle of a 10 min time window, to allow visual comparison.

Note that both <span>\(\Delta \bar{r}\)</span> and <span>\(\bar{v}\)</span> are vectors defined positive in the bearing direction, i.e., inwards the 7th arc. Illustration of the possible time duration and distance travelled (Eq. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="equation anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Equ4">4</a>) as a function of the aircraft average velocity (defined positive in the direction of the bearing, travelling away). Hence, for this event to be associated with MH370, the aircraft must have remained in air for at least 10 min prior to impacting the water surface. Even for a considerably low average velocity of 1450 m/s, it would require the aircraft to remain in air about 13 min after the last handshake, and travel an extra distance of about 350 km. Finally, adding a tolerance of 0.5<span>\(^{\circ }\)</span> in the bearing calculations provides the possible impact scenario depicted in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig10">10</a>. <i>Later impact</i> (blue area) is associated with lower average velocity travelled in opposite direction from H01W, and thus closer distance to the 7th arc, whereas <i>Earlier impact</i> is associated with spending a longer time in air with a higher average velocity resulting in travelling further away from the 7th arc, opposite to H01W. It is possible that the aircraft crash is outwards the 7th arc in the direction of H01W, but that will require the aircraft to last a much longer time in the air (above 17 min), before finally impacting the water.</p><p>It is worth noting that the signal with bearing <span>\(268.24^{\circ }\)</span> recorded at 00:39:02 UTC is the only signal with <span>\(\Delta t = 0\)</span>, thus if originated at the exact 7th arc time, it would also be exact location.

The authors reported a transmission loss reduction of 20 dB due to scattering by the Rio Grande Rise along H10N path. They asserted that the substantial bathymetric rise accounted for the higher recorded levels at H04S compared to H10N - noting that H04S is 8000 km far from the incident location, approximately 2000 km further than the path to H10N. The transects of these paths are shown in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig15">15</a>a.</p><p>Examining the transect of the F-35a case reveals a clear path, suggesting minimal losses due to bathymetric scattering and potentially explaining the distinct signal reception, see Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig15">15</a>b. In the case of the 7th arc, the path to H01W is very similar to that of F-35a, though the distance is twice as short. Consequently, one would anticipate a clear distinct signal with minor losses due to a slight bathymetric rise near H01W, Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1#Fig15">15</a>c. On the other hand, the path from the 7th arc to H08S presents a bathymetric barrier of comparable size, half way along the route, resembling the scenario of the ARA San Juan Submarine. Therefore, in the case of MH370, which arguably had a significantly less energetic compared to the Argentinian submarine, observing the signal at H08S becomes a challenging task, if feasible at all, due to transmission losses induced by bathymetry.</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-15" data-title="Figure 15"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig15" data-test="figure-caption-text">Figure 15</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60529-1/figures/15" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-60529-1/MediaObjects/41598_2024_60529_Fig15_HTML.png?as=webp"/><img aria-describedby="Fig15" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-60529-1/MediaObjects/41598_2024_60529_Fig15_HTML.png" alt="figure 15" loading="lazy" width="685" height="764"/></picture></a></div><p>Transects of events to corresponding hydrophones.
