    <h1>Deno Joins TC39</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Deno aims to be the best runtime for the modern JavaScript developer. One way we
do this is by embracing the latest in JavaScript standards. Deno is
fundamentally built for modern JavaScript: Promises, async/await, ES modules and
async iterators are all first-class citizens.</p>
<p>To make sure that future evolutions of JavaScript will continue to work well for
Deno - and server-side JavaScript runtimes in general - the Deno company has
<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/news/ecma-international-welcomes-new-members-5/" rel="noopener noreferrer">joined ECMA International</a>, the standards organization that is
responsible for <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the JavaScript standard (ECMA-262)</a>.</p>
<p>We will be working with other ECMA members and the wider JS community on the
next iterations of JavaScript, in the <a href="https://tc39.es" rel="noopener noreferrer">TC39 working group</a>. We will be
pushing for features and improvements to the language that benefit everyone, but
especially users of server-side JavaScript.</p>
<p>Some of the features that we are looking to work on soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better support for non-JS assets in the ES module graph</li>
<li>Better support for explicit resource management</li>
<li>More extensive standard library functions for (async) iteration</li>
</ul>
<p>As TypeScript is a core part of the Deno ecosystem, we are also very interested
in pushing for even closer alignment of TypeScript and JavaScript in the future.</p>
<p>I (Luca Casonato) will be Deno&#39;s primary representative at TC39. If you have
suggestions of features or improvements that could make JavaScript better,
please email me at <a href="mailto:luca@deno.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">luca@deno.com</a> or send me a message on
Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/lcasdev" rel="noopener noreferrer">@lcasdev</a>. I am excited to work with other members of TC39
on pushing JavaScript to new heights.</p>
