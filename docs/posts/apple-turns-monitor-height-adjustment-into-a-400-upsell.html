    <h1>Apple turns monitor height adjustment into a $400 upsell</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple unveiled a new standalone monitor—the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-studio-display-185619355.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0"><ins>$1599 Studio Display</ins></a>—that includes your choice of either a tilt-adjustable stand or a VESA wall mount adaptor. But for $400 more, you can purchase a fancier tilt <em>and </em>height-adjustable version of that stand. In the Apple universe, a 5K retina display monitor and stand aimed at the consumer market priced just shy of $2000 is a steal. Be forewarned: If you&#39;re partial to non-reflective surfaces, shooting for nano-texture glass on the Studio Display is another additional $300. </p>
<p>Even hardcore Apple enthusiasts balked at the Pro Display XDR the company released in 2019, which started at $4,999, not including $999 for the (optional) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-04-apple-pro-display-xdr-stand.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0"><ins>stand</ins></a>. Back then, we called the smooth, elegantly designed accessory “an expensive gadget no one needs”. It’s due to this type of conditioning that a $400 metal stand— even though it’s roughly the same price as a new iPad with 128 GB of storage or an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-hits-new-low-of-380-ahead-of-black-friday-133854389.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0"><ins>Apple Watch Series 7</ins></a>—still seems like a bargain. It’s definitely not.</p>
<p>For consumers who opt not to purchase the $400 stand, the stand included with the Studio Display is still tilt-adjustable. If you want to save some desk space, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mount/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0"><ins>mounting</ins></a> your Studio Display is another good option. But for those who struggle with eye strain or are using a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-08-the-best-standing-desks.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0"><ins>standing desk</ins></a>, a height-adjustable stand is non-negotiable.</p>
<p>Those still recovering from sticker shock induced by the $400 Studio Display stand should also remember the cost of <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX572ZM/A/apple-mac-pro-wheels-kit" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0"><ins>wheels</ins></a> for the Apple Mac Pro, which will set you back $699. Once again, this new mount feels like a relative bargain.</p></div><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
