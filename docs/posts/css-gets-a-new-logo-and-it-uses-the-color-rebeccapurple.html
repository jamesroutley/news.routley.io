    <h1>CSS gets a new logo and it uses the color `rebeccapurple`</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://github.com/CSS-Next/css-next/issues/105">A community vote</a> in the CSS-Next repository on GitHub decided on a new official logo for CSS. The design follows the design language of the logos of other web technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.michaelcharl.es/f8dd798e-7651-49a4-9071-c1621c639b3b.png" alt="A demonstration of the new rebeccapurple colored CSS logo alongside the logos from JavaScript, TypeScript, WebAssembly, and other web technologies"/></figure>
<p>But perhaps more importantly, the logo uses the color <code><span>rebeccapurple</span></code> (<code><span>#663399</span></code>), a color that was <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Jun/0312.html">added to the CSS specification</a> in 2014 in honor of Eric Meyer&#39;s daughter, Rebecca, who passed away at the age of six on her birthday from brain cancer.</p>
<p>Eric Meyer, author of several books on CSS, has been an important figure in the CSS community since the late 1990s.</p>
<p>The color was originally going to be called <code><span>beccapurple</span></code>, but <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/19/rebeccapurple/">Meyer asked</a> that it instead be named <code><span>rebeccapurple</span></code>, as his daughter had wanted to be called Rebecca once she had turned six. She had said that Becca was a &#34;baby name,&#34; and that once she had turned six, she wanted to be called Rebecca. As Eric Meyer put it, &#34;She made it to six. For almost twelve hours, she was six. So Rebecca it is and must be.&#34;</p>
