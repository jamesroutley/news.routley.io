  <p>Today, the United States Senate held a hearing to consider the future of AI oversight. Ahead of the hearing, Stability AI was pleased to share a detailed paper emphasizing the importance of open models for a transparent, competitive, and resilient digital economy from CEO Emad Mostaque. </p><blockquote><p><em>“These technologies will be the backbone of our digital economy, and it is essential that the public can scrutinize their development. Open models and open datasets will help to improve safety through transparency, foster competition, and ensure the United States retains strategic leadership in critical AI capabilities. Grassroots innovation is America’s greatest asset, and open models will help to put these tools in the hands of workers and firms across the economy.” - </em>Emad Mostaque, CEO Stability AI</p></blockquote><p>You can read the paper <a href="https://stability.ai/s/Statement-from-Stability-AI-to-the-Senate-Judiciary-Subcommittee-on-Privacy-Technology-and-the-Law.pdf" target="_blank"><span>here</span></a>.</p>
