</figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The numbers shown above are the results of running an optimisation algorithm. Its aim is to find <strong>optimal power flow</strong>.

However, the amount of power that each power plant actually produces depends on the price they offer. This price varies wildly from hour to hour, and neither the price nor the power amount is publicly available.</p><p>Instead, <code>pypsa-eur</code> makes assumptions on prices for solar, wind, coal, nuclear, etc. based on historical averages, and then runs an optimisation algorithm to cover all consumption for the least cost of production. In short:</p><blockquote>It&#39;s <strong>the real way of calculating who produces how much</strong>, and <strong>how the power flows</strong> in that case;</blockquote><p>For a full discussion of the limitations of the model, have a look at chapter 4 of the original <code>pypsa-eur</code> paper:</p><figure><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01613"><div><p>PyPSA-Eur: An Open Optimisation Model of the European Transmission System</p><p>PyPSA-Eur, the first open model dataset of the European power system at thetransmission network level to cover the full ENTSO-E area, is presented.

Just building more renewable generation won&#39;t solve it though, as you still need to make sure it covers all consumption <strong>everywhere</strong>. This map intends to show why that&#39;s a complicated problem, and why we should also be smart about <strong>where</strong> we build renewable generation so that most of the generated energy can also be <strong>used</strong> and not <strong>thrown away</strong> because the grid can&#39;t handle it.</p><p>I wrote a less condensed explanation of this problem in another post:</p><figure><a href="https://121gigawatts.org/the-copper-plate-must-die/"><div><p>The Copper Plate Must Die üíÄ</p><p>EU energy market rules are counterproductive to grid congestion &amp; don‚Äôt incentivise optimal use of renewables.</p><p><img src="https://121gigawatts.org/favicon.png" alt=""/><span>1.21 Gigawatts</span><span>Zolt√°n Mariƒá</span></p></div><p><img src="https://121gigawatts.org/content/images/2022/06/title-slide-2.gif" alt=""/></p></a></figure><h2 id="%F0%9F%91%8B">üëã</h2>
