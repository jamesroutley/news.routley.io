<p><b>Railway time</b> was the standardised time arrangement first applied by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Railway" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a> in England in November 1840, the first recorded occasion when different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_mean_time" title="Local mean time">local mean times</a> were synchronised and a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_time" title="Standard time">standard time</a> applied.  The key goals behind introducing railway time were to overcome the confusion caused by having non-uniform local times in each town and station stop along the expanding railway network<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> and to reduce the incidence of accidents and near misses, which were becoming more frequent as the number of train journeys increased.
</p><p>Railway time was progressively taken up by all railway companies in Great Britain over the following seven years.  The schedules by which trains were organised and the time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_clock" title="Station clock">station clocks</a> displayed were brought in line with the local mean time for London or &#34;London Time&#34;, the time set at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich" title="Greenwich">Greenwich</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich" title="Royal Observatory, Greenwich">Royal Observatory</a>, which was already widely known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time" title="Greenwich Mean Time">Greenwich Mean Time</a> (GMT).
</p><p>The development of railway networks in North America in the 1850s,<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> India in around 1860,<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> and in Europe, prompted the introduction of standard time influenced by geography, industrial development, and political governance.
</p><p>The railway companies sometimes faced concerted resistance from local people who refused to adjust their public clocks to bring them into line with London Time. As a consequence, two different times would be displayed in the town and in use, with the station clocks and the times published in train timetables differing by several minutes from that on other clocks. Despite this early reluctance, railway time rapidly became adopted as the default time across the whole of Great Britain, although it took until 1880 for the government to legislate on the establishment of a single standard time and a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone" title="Time zone">time zone</a> for the country.<sup id="cite_ref-History_of_Railway_Time_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-History_of_Railway_Time-4">[4]</a></sup>

<p>Until the latter part of the 18th century, time was normally determined in each town by a local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial" title="Sundial">sundial</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time" title="Solar time">Solar time</a> is calculated with reference to the relative position of the sun. This provided only an approximation as to time due to variations in orbits and had become unsuitable for day-to-day purposes. It was replaced by local mean time, which eliminated the variation due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time" title="Equation of time">seasonal differences and anomalies</a>. It also took account of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude" title="Longitude">longitude</a> of a location and enabled a precise time to be applied.
</p><p>Such new-found precision did not overcome a different problem: the differences between the local times of neighbouring towns. In Britain, local time differed by up to 20 minutes from that of London. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> Time was 5 minutes behind Greenwich Time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> Time 6 minutes behind, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnforth" title="Carnforth">Carnforth</a> 11 minutes behind, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrow-in-Furness" title="Barrow-in-Furness">Barrow</a> almost 13 minutes behind.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>  In India and North America, these differences could be 60 minutes or more. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanacs" title="Almanacs">Almanacs</a> containing tables were published and instructions attached to sundials to enable the differences between local times to be computed.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>Before the arrival of the railways, journeys between the larger cities and towns could take many hours or days, and these differences could be dealt with by adjusting the hands of a watch periodically en route. In Britain, the coaching companies published schedules providing details of the corrections required. However, this variation in local times was large enough to present problems for the railway schedules. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> time was six minutes behind London, whilst <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> was ten minutes behind; sunrise for towns to the east, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>, occurred several minutes ahead of London. It soon became apparent that even such small discrepancies in times caused confusion, disruption, or even accidents.

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_telegraph" title="Electric telegraph">electric telegraph</a>, which had been developed in the early part of the 19th century, was refined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fothergill_Cooke" title="William Fothergill Cooke">William Fothergill Cooke</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone" title="Charles Wheatstone">Charles Wheatstone</a> and was installed on a short section of the Great Western Railway in 1839. By 1852 a telegraph link had been constructed between a new electro-magnetic clock at Greenwich and initially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewisham" title="Lewisham">Lewisham</a>, and shortly after this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Bridge" title="London Bridge">London Bridge</a> stations. It also connected via the Central Telegraph Station of the Electric Time Company in the City of London, which enabled the transmission of a time signal along the railway telegraphic network to other stations. By 1855 time signals from Greenwich could be sent through wires alongside the railway lines across the length and breadth of Britain.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>  This technology was also used in India to synchronise railway time.

<p>Before the advent of the telegraph, stationmasters adjusted their clocks using tables supplied by the railway company to convert local time to London Time.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> In turn, train guards set their chronometers against those clocks.
</p><p>The introduction of railway time was in the end swift despite not being straightforward. The Great Western Railway was the first to standardise its timetable on Greenwich Mean Time, in November 1840. One of the most vociferous proponents of standardising time on the railways was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Booth" title="Henry Booth">Henry Booth</a>, Secretary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway" title="Liverpool and Manchester Railway">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a>, who by January 1846 had ordered the adjustment of clocks to Greenwich Mean Time at both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> stations.
</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Railway" title="Midland Railway">Midland Railway</a> adopted London Time at all of its stations on 1 January 1846.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> As a consequence, in February 1846 the town council of Nottingham ordered that the town clocks be furnished with three hands, two indicating local time and the additional one the railway and post-office London time.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p>On 22 September 1847, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_Clearing_House" title="Railway Clearing House">Railway Clearing House</a>, set up five years earlier to coordinate the distribution of revenue between railway companies, decreed that &#34;GMT be adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it&#34;. From 1 December 1847, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_and_North_Western_Railway" title="London and North Western Railway">London and North Western</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonian_Railway" title="Caledonian Railway">Caledonian</a> Railways switched over. By January 1848, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bradshaw" title="George Bradshaw">Bradshaws Railway Guide</a>, the railways that had adopted London Time included the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_and_South_Western_Railway" title="London and South Western Railway">London and South Western</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Railway" title="Midland Railway">Midland</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_and_Birkenhead_Railway" title="Chester and Birkenhead Railway">Chester and Birkenhead</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster_and_Carlisle_Railway" title="Lancaster and Carlisle Railway">Lancaster and Carlisle</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Lancashire_Railway_1844-1859" title="East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859">East Lancashire</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_and_North_Midland_Railway" title="York and North Midland Railway">York and North Midland</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-History_of_Railway_Time_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-History_of_Railway_Time-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>It was reported that by 1855 that 98 percent of towns and cities had transferred to GMT.<sup id="cite_ref-greycat.org_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-greycat.org-5">[5]</a></sup> On the other hand, not all railway companies convinced the local dignitaries to bring their clocks on public buildings in line without stern resistance. Although by 1844 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_and_Exeter_Railway" title="Bristol and Exeter Railway">Bristol and Exeter Railway</a> was running to London Time, the public clocks at both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter" title="Exeter">Exeter</a> and Bristol operated to local time but showed London Time by a second minute hand, 14 and 10 minutes ahead, respectively, of its companion. In Exeter this situation arose due to the reluctance of the Dean of Exeter Cathedral to concede to the demands of the railway company, the cathedral clock being the principal timekeeper for the city. Similarly, the clock at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exchange,_Bristol" title="The Exchange, Bristol">The Bristol Exchange</a> installed in 1822 subsequently had a second minute hand added.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Bristol did not solely recognise railway time until September 1852.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> It was not for a further eight years and the arrival of the electric telegraph that railway time was the sole time recognised in these towns and others in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country" title="West Country">West Country</a>, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonport,_Devon" title="Devonport, Devon">Devonport</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth" title="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>.

</p><p>It was not until 2 August 1880, when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutes_(Definition_of_Time)_Act_1880" title="Statutes (Definition of Time) Act 1880">Statutes (Definition of Time) Act</a> received the Royal Assent, that a unified standard time for the whole of Great Britain achieved legal status.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> As late as the 1950s, the Western Region of British Railways had an elaborate telephone ritual at 11:00 am for all signal boxes to synchronise their clocks with that at Paddington Station.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

<p>One of the first reported incidents which brought about a change in how time was organised on railways in the United States occurred in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a> in August 1853. Two trains heading towards each other on the same track collided as the train guards had different times set on their watches, resulting in the death of 14 passengers. Railway schedules were co-ordinated in New England shortly after this incident<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Numerous other collisions led to the setting up of the General Time Convention, a committee of railway companies to agree on scheduling.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Economics_of_Time_Zones_18-0"><a href="#cite_note-The_Economics_of_Time_Zones-18">[18]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1870 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_F._Dowd" title="Charles F. Dowd">Charles F. Dowd</a>, who was unconnected with the railway movement or civil authorities, proposed <i>A System of National Times for Railroads</i>, which involved a single time for railways but the keeping of local times for towns. Although this did not find favour with railway managers, in 1881 they agreed for the idea to be investigated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Frederick_Allen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="William Frederick Allen (page does not exist)">William Frederick Allen</a>, Secretary of the General Time Convention and Managing Editor of the <i>Travellers&#39; Official Guide to the Railways</i>. He proposed replacing the 50 different railway times with five time zones. He eventually persuaded the railway managers and the politicians running the cities that had several railway stations that it was in their interests to speedily adopt his simpler proposals, which aligned the zones with cities&#39; railroad stations. In doing so they would pre-empt the imposition of more costly and cumbersome arrangements by different state legislators and the naval authorities, both of whom favoured retention of local times.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Economics_of_Time_Zones_18-1"><a href="#cite_note-The_Economics_of_Time_Zones-18">[18]</a></sup>
</p><p>Right to the end there was opposition expressed by many smaller towns and cities to the imposition of railway time. For example, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis" title="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> the report in the daily Sentinel for 17 November 1883 protested that people would have to &#34;eat sleep work ... and marry by railroad time&#34;.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> However, with the support of nearly all railway companies, most cities and influential observatories such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale" title="Yale">Yale</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard" title="Harvard">Harvard</a>, this collaborative approach led to standard railway time being introduced at noon on 18 November 1883.

<p>France adopted Paris Mean Time as its standard national time in 1891. It also required clocks inside railway stations and train schedules to be set five minutes late to allow travelers to arrive late without missing their trains, even while clocks on the external walls of railway stations displayed Paris Mean Time. In 1911, France adopted Paris Mean Time delayed 9 minutes 21 seconds, making it equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time without mentioning Greenwich. At the same time, slow railway station clocks were eliminated.<sup id="cite_ref-The_origin_of_time_zones_22-0"><a href="#cite_note-The_origin_of_time_zones-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

<p>Ireland and France were the only countries that decided not to officially adopt Greenwich Time, reflecting the political sensitivities of the time.

<p>Though several private railways had been built construction of public railways in Sweden came later than most other European countries, delayed by concerns over construction costs and resistance from powerful shipping owners. Railway time was introduced on the main railway line between Stockholm and Gothenburg which opened in 1862. Timetables were based on solar time at Gothenburg, the westernmost end of the line. As a consequence passengers and businesses following local time would arrive at the station ahead of the train. There were many private railways that followed local time or their own railway time. On 1 January 1879, a national standard time was introduced across the whole of Sweden, one hour advanced of Greenwich mean time.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

<p>The Indian railway companies had to contend with different local times as the rapidly expanding routes extended out from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> (formerly Bombay), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> (formerly Calcutta), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore" title="Lahore">Lahore</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai" title="Chennai">Chennai</a> (formerly Madras). Towards the end of the 1860s the situation became even more confused as the networks linked up. In 1870, to overcome the problems occurring, Chennai (Madras) time was adopted for all railways, for two reasons: the longitude of Chennai is roughly midway between those of Kolkata and Mumbai, and the Observatory there ran the telegraphic service which could be utilised to synchronise station times via the same time-signal system first used in Britain in 1852 to regulate railway time.  <i>Madras Time</i> was popularised by its use in Newman&#39;s Indian Bradshaw Timetables.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>
</p><p>However, unlike in Britain, where railway time was rapidly adopted countrywide and evolved not long after into standard time, in India the much larger size of the country and the autonomy enjoyed by Mumbai and Kolkata resulted in both Presidencies&#39; retaining local times well into the 20th century. For the remaining part of the 19th century <i>Madras time</i> continued to be used by all railways.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>
</p><p>Proposals had been put forward for at least one meridian–based time zone for India as early as 1884. However, no consensus could be reached until 1906, when a single time zone based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahabad" title="Allahabad">Allahabad</a> was established, and a standard time was introduced, which the railways came in line with. Despite this, Kolkata kept its own time until 1948 and to a lesser extent Mumbai continued to unofficially until 1955.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>
