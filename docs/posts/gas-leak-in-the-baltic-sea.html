                <p><em>By the Danish Defence Command</em></p>

<p>Following the three gas leaks on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea, prohibition zones have been established around the leaks for the sake of the safety of ship and air traffic.</p>

<p>Nord Stream 1 has two leaks northeast of Bornholm, Nord Stream 2 has one leak south of Dueodde. The leaks were discovered by the Danish Defence F-16 interceptor response unit.Â </p>

<p>The defense is supporting in connection with the authorities&#39; efforts regarding the leaks on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea. The frigate Absalon and the pollution control vessel ship Gunnar Thorson are on their way to carry out water monitoring at the exclusion zones, and the Danish Defence are also supporting with a helicopter capacity. In addition, the patrol ship Rota was in the area last night.</p>

<p>The Danish Defense has no further comments at this time.</p>

<p>Here is the video from the Danish Defence helicopter SAR emergency at Roskilde:</p>
