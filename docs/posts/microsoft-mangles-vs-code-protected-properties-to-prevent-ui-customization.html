    <h1>Microsoft mangles VS Code protected properties to prevent UI customization</h1>

          <p dir="auto">Making my voice heard here. It&#39;s utterly wild and slightly baffling that folks needed to even rely on a monkey patch enhancements for the smallest tweaks like (for example) hiding the title bar. While this PR is great work overall, the fact that it has rendered the extension customize-ui inoperable is just ratchet.</p>
<p dir="auto">While MS and the vscode team work tirelessly to deliver a great product the issue pertaining to the UI specifically the title bar for MacOS users is something that has persisted for several years. It&#39;s my hope that MS and the vscode team seriously consider exposing options for hiding the title bar and not continue to sit on the issue that quite literally has been the deciding factor of many when it come to choosing vscode over alternatives in the nexus. Personally, I didn&#39;t adopt vscode until I had the patch available.</p>
<p dir="auto">Developers spend hours within the editors UI and our brains become accustomed. This is why folks have favourite themes, syntax colour quirks and font preferences. Developers coding in the confinements of laptop screens or those which don&#39;t leverage dual screens only have limited dimensions to work within and the title bar is a heathen which lives rent free and takes up space in an unapologetic manner.</p>
<p dir="auto">v1.74.0 has disrupted the ui aesthetics for over 100k users who rely on customize-ui. Don&#39;t let vscode die on this hill.</p>
