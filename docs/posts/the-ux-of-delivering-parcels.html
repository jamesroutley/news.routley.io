    <h1>The UX of delivering parcels</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I shipped identical boxes, less than a mile, with 6 different delivery companies.</p>
<p><strong>One was seized by the police</strong>—oh, to be a fly on the wall when they opened it.</p>
<p>Shipping and logistics companies aren&#39;t just moving goods, they play a key role in the general user experience of eCommerce.<br/></p>
<ul></ul></div><p>84% of shoppers claim that they&#39;d stop buying items from a retailer after just one poor delivery experience ¹.</p><div><p>And in a separate study, 94% of consumers said that they would actually <em>blame</em> the retailer directly, for any problems ².</p>
<p>That relationship, between retailer, courier and customer, is what makes this industry—where most providers sell essentially identical services—a great example to study.<br/></p></div><h3 id="what-we-ll-cover-" type="h3" content="What we&#39;ll cover:">What we&#39;ll cover:</h3><div><ul><li><p>💸</p><span>Why pricing transparency is key</span></li><li><p>⚡️</p><span>5 ideas to make your forms easier to use</span></li><li><p>☔️</p><span>Why we all seek reassurance post-purchase</span></li><li><p>💬</p><span>The role of communication in UX</span></li><li><p>🥞</p><span>Plus many more UX tips and ideas</span></li></ul></div><div>
<p>Buckle up, the user experience of booking and shipping parcels is probably <em>worse than you realise</em>.</p></div><h3 id="obscure-pricing" type="h3" content="1. Obscure pricing">1. Obscure pricing</h3><div><p>Let&#39;s set the scene with some context.</p>
<p>These are the 6 companies I selected, and how much it cost to ship each of my parcels:</p></div><div><p>Cost of shipping my 1kg parcel, 0.4 miles</p><div><div><p><img alt="BarChart_barChartItemValue__G1rUu" loading="lazy" width="200" height="89" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/Evri-logo.png"/></p><p><span></span><span>£4.28</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="BarChart_barChartItemValue__G1rUu" loading="lazy" width="200" height="89" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/parcelforce-logo.png"/></p><p><span></span><span>£7.40</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="BarChart_barChartItemValue__G1rUu" loading="lazy" width="200" height="89" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/DPD_logo.png"/></p><p><span></span><span>£7.67</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="BarChart_barChartItemValue__G1rUu" loading="lazy" width="200" height="89" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/fedex-logo.png"/></p><p><span></span><span>£9.66</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="BarChart_barChartItemValue__G1rUu" loading="lazy" width="200" height="89" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/UPS-logo.png"/></p><p><span></span><span>£10.71</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="BarChart_barChartItemValue__G1rUu" loading="lazy" width="200" height="89" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/DHL-logo.png"/></p><p><span></span><span>£15.56</span></p></div></div><p>Cost of 1-day delivery, with drop-off</p></div><div><p>It&#39;s not just the disparity in pricing that&#39;s surprising—even getting a quote is awkward.<br/></p>
<p>For example, look at this from FedEx:</p></div><p><img alt="null image" loading="lazy" width="1990" height="1016" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/FedExPricing.webp"/></p><p>I&#39;m sending a single parcel. How have I been given a volume discount?﻿</p><div><p>Similar to the competition for international payments, as the courier industry becomes more commodotised, <strong>price</strong> is a key differentiator between providers.</p>
<p>To reel you in, some of the couriers have a separate tool, allowing you to get a price <em>before</em> going through the hassle of completing all of the forms.</p>
<p>This kind of price transparency is similar in concept to what Wise does (very effectively).<br/></p></div><div><p>Wise are so transparent with their prices, that they&#39;ll link directly to a fee calculator on their splash page (i.e., before you&#39;ve made any commitment to use the app).</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://builtformars.com/ux-bites/leading-with-your-prices"><img alt="Leading with your prices image" loading="lazy" width="1215" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/WiseFees_2023-10-29-093446_lczi.webp"/></a></p></div><div><p>But in most instances it&#39;s been executed without finesse.</p>
<p>Here are 3 UPS screenshots for identical deliveries, taken within 5 minutes of each other. All with different prices—one is even 10x more expensive.</p></div><p>If I can simply refresh a results page, and get shown a materially different price, how can I trust that I&#39;m <em>ever</em> getting a good deal?</p><h3 id="inefficient-booking-flows" type="h3" content="2. Inefficient booking flows">2. Inefficient booking flows</h3><div><p>FedEx&#39;s set-up process was so convoluted, that after calling customer services 3 times, and more than 200 clicks, <strong>I stopped counting and gave up</strong>.<br/></p>
<p>On the final call, the app was outright not working. I listened as the guy audibly gave up, let out a sigh, and suggested &#34;<em>maybe just go on fedex.com</em>&#34;.</p>
<p>It&#39;d amaze me if small retailers were happy, or even able to, use the interface that I had access to.<br/></p>
<p>But across the board, there&#39;s <strong>so much low-hanging fruit</strong>.</p></div><p>These companies use almost none of the common techniques to reduce effort throughout a form.</p><p><strong>5 techniques to improve your form design:</strong></p><div><div><p>⚡️</p><div><p>Auto-focus on first field</p><p>When the page loads, don&#39;t force the user to click into the first field.</p></div></div><div><p>⌨️</p><div><p>Select the right field data types</p><p>So that the operating system brings up the most suitable keyboard (e.g., numerical).</p></div></div><div><p>👉</p><div><p>Auto-proceed on suitable fields</p><p>If you&#39;re asking for a 6-digit code, auto-proceed once they&#39;ve entered the 6th digit.</p></div></div><div><p>🇬🇧</p><div><p>Suggest sensible default options</p><p>For example, if the sender&#39;s address is in the UK, default to a UK phone number.</p></div></div><div><p>➡️</p><div><p>Utilise keyboard &#39;next&#39; buttons</p><p>So it focuses on the next field, rather than just close the keyboard.</p></div></div></div><p>As a result, the amount of waste and inefficiency in these flows is truly mind-blowing. <br/></p><div><p>Clicks to create account &amp; send parcel</p><p>Clicks</p></div><p>For comparison, this is in some cases, 4x more clicks than it takes to open a <a href="https://builtformars.com/case-studies/opening-12-bank-accounts" target="_blank"><u>real bank account</u></a>.</p><p>Even worse, most haven&#39;t built the functionality to actually let you book a delivery using the app.</p><div><p>Instead you get palmed off onto a non-responsive website, which is clearly designed for desktop use only.<br/></p>
<p>It&#39;s why there are no slides for this study—I&#39;d enjoy making the memes, but it&#39;d be an incoherent mess.<br/></p></div><p>Optimising your form design (i.e., booking flows, purchases and sign-up), can be one of the most impactful ways to improve conversion rates.</p><p>And it&#39;s usually just a case of listening to and implementing the basic <a href="https://builtformars.com/ux-glossary" target="_blank"><u>design principles</u></a>—not an improvement through innovation or new features.<br/></p><h3 id="reassurance-seeking" type="h3" content="3. Reassurance seeking">3. Reassurance seeking</h3><p>Imagine if after booking an Airbnb, you couldn&#39;t <strong>immediately</strong> see that reservation in your account.</p><p>I&#39;ve observed that moment of anxiety across many services and industries. It&#39;s an instinctive desire to seek reassurance.</p><div><p>Importantly, this can be true even if you&#39;ve <strong><em>already</em></strong> seen an &#34;action complete&#34; status at the end of the booking form.</p>
<p>The distinction is that for a purchase without an immediate reward, your task remains incomplete. You still need to drop the parcel off, or wait for it to be collected.</p>
<p>Once the temporary status is off-screen, you <strong>crave a place to store the details, and track the progression of that incomplete task</strong>.</p>
<p>What I&#39;m describing is a second-order benefit of the <strong>tracking number</strong>.</p>
<p>This is why it&#39;s damaging when the tracking number you&#39;ve just been given errors, or shows confusing statuses.</p></div><div><p>Saying &#34;<em>estimated delivery: <strong>not available</strong></em>&#34;, entirely ignores this behaviour.<br/></p>
<p>In most cases, the tracking number only started working once the parcel had been collected or dropped off.</p>
<p>I can understand this from a technical perspective, but that leaves hours, if not days, where the user has nowhere to see this booking, or <strong>learn about the process</strong>.</p></div><p>Take a look at this UX Bite from Revolut, who&#39;ve tackled this problem excellently.</p><div><p>After ordering a new card on Revolut, you&#39;ll see this, which serves both as a reassuring reminder, and a tracking link.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://builtformars.com/ux-bites/ordering-a-new-card"><img alt="Ordering a new card image" loading="lazy" width="2430" height="1596" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/RevolutPaymentTimeline2.webp"/></a></p></div><p>Let&#39;s summarise why this is so<strong> effective at reducing both anxiety</strong>, and the<strong> <a href="https://builtformars.com/tooltips/cognitive-load">🧠 Cognitive Load</a>.</strong></p><div><div><p>🚦</p><div><p>1. It shows the current status</p><p>i.e., the order is in progress.</p></div></div><div><p>🚗</p><div><p>2. It explains the process</p><p>i.e., the next step is for Revolut to post your card.</p></div></div><div><p>⌛️</p><div><p>3. Gives context about the timeline</p><p>i.e., estimated to arrive on the 8th.</p></div></div><div><p>📦</p><div><p>4. A status with permanence</p><p>i.e., you&#39;re reassured that you can always come back here to check the tracking status.</p></div></div></div><p>In fact, Revolut might have done this to counter-act the unreliable nature of<strong> third party tracking numbers</strong>.<br/></p><h3 id="receiving-a-parcel" type="h3" content="4. Receiving a parcel">4. Receiving a parcel</h3><div><p>Using the data from a poll of tens of thousands of UK consumers, it seems like there&#39;s a slight correlation (or perhaps causation) between price and customer satisfaction. ³<br/></p>
<p>But given that there&#39;s such a broad <strong><em>range</em></strong> of prices (£4.28 → £15.56), and the process of getting a quote is difficult, how is a small retailer supposed to use this data to comfortably make a decision?</p>
<p>How do they not overpay?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s that customer satisfaction data, <strong>ordered by price</strong>.</p></div><div><p>Customer satisfaction</p><div><div><p><img alt="BarChart_barChartItemValue__G1rUu" loading="lazy" width="200" height="89" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/Evri-logo.png"/></p><p><span></span><span>19.6% (#6)</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="BarChart_barChartItemValue__G1rUu" loading="lazy" width="200" height="89" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/parcelforce-logo.png"/></p><p><span></span><span>38.2% (#4)</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="BarChart_barChartItemValue__G1rUu" loading="lazy" width="200" height="89" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/DPD_logo.png"/></p><p><span></span><span>59.8% (#1)</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="BarChart_barChartItemValue__G1rUu" loading="lazy" width="200" height="89" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/fedex-logo.png"/></p><p><span></span><span>37.7% (#5)</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="BarChart_barChartItemValue__G1rUu" loading="lazy" width="200" height="89" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/UPS-logo.png"/></p><p><span></span><span>40.7% (#3)</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="BarChart_barChartItemValue__G1rUu" loading="lazy" width="200" height="89" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/DHL-logo.png"/></p><p><span></span><span>44.3% (#2)</span></p></div></div><p>% who voted &#34;Great&#34; out of Great, Okay, Poor.</p></div><div><p>Why are some of these services disliked more than others?<br/></p>
<p>At first I assumed that they were just worse at delivering parcels, but the most reliable data I could find suggests that DPD (the best rated by customers) actually has a similar number of failed deliveries as Evri (the worst rated). ⁴<br/></p></div><p>One major differentiating factor here is communication.</p><div><p>UPS didn&#39;t send the recipient anything on the day.<br/></p>
<p>Parcelforce texted me, Evri emailed me, but <strong>only DPD used time-sensitive notifications</strong>.<br/></p></div><p><img alt="null image" loading="lazy" width="2046" height="886" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/DPDDeliveries2.webp"/></p><p>It&#39;s executed brilliantly, and may help explain why DPD consistently perform better in customer satisfaction surveys.<br/></p><h3 id="breakfast-in-a-box" type="h3" content="5. Breakfast in a box">5. Breakfast in a box</h3><div><p>Out of the 5 scheduled deliveries, <strong>only 4 arrived</strong>. <br/></p>
<p>DHL collected my parcel, took it 40 miles away, and through customs for a security check.<br/></p></div><p>At this point they would have been confronted with a very strange sight. In each box, was a single Weetabix.</p><p><img alt="null image" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="638" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/WeetabixWithBox.webp"/></p><p>I contacted customer services 17 times in 49 days, after which they informed me that it&#39;d been seized by the police.</p><div><p>And yet, until the 49th day, I was repeatedly promised that it would still arrive, and there was just a backlog.<br/></p>
<p>It&#39;s clearly a common problem, at least in the UK.</p>
<p>34% of UK shoppers claim that they experienced a delivery problem with the <em>most recent</em> parcel they received (or tried to) ⁵.</p>
<p>Even more frustratingly, the interface was as confused as I imagine the customs officials were.</p></div><p>Lets consider the <strong><em>messaging</em></strong> of this for a moment:<br/></p><p><img alt="null image" loading="lazy" width="2527" height="1657" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/DHLGoneWrong.webp"/></p><div><div><p>1️⃣</p><div><p>Status of &#39;exception&#39;</p><p>What does this mean? It&#39;s an exception to what? It was exceptionally tasty with milk?</p></div></div><div><p>2️⃣</p><div><p>Shipment closed</p><p>Why&#39;s it closed? Is it not arriving then?</p></div></div><div><p>3️⃣</p><div><p>Scheduled delivery date not available</p><p>This replaced &#34;shipment closed&#34;, so is it open again?</p></div></div><div><p>4️⃣</p><div><p>Contact DHL</p><p>Why can&#39;t you contact me? It&#39;s been 49 days.</p></div></div></div><div><p>Those statements may be technically correct—likely referring to some functional status.</p>
<p>But no care has gone into <strong>contextualising what the user is shown</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, <strong><a href="https://builtformars.com/tooltips/fuzzy-context">🐨 Fuzzy Context</a></strong> like this often confuses the user <em>even more</em>. </p>
<p>For example, trying to work out what &#34;shipment closed&#34; means, when customer services will tell you that the parcel is <em>still expected to arrive</em>.<br/></p></div><p><img alt="null image" loading="lazy" width="1004" height="597" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://content.builtformars.com/uploads/images/WeetabixGuard2.webp"/></p><h3 id="summary" type="h3" content="Summary">Summary</h3><div><p>Most people I&#39;ve spoken to have visceral opinions on a number of courier services.<br/></p>
<p>Clearly, delivering the parcel safely is the most important factor to consider, and a few bad experiences create an impression that&#39;s hard to shift.<br/></p>
<p>But whilst we rightly hold that specific delivery company responsible, the data suggests we usually attribute blame <strong>towards the retailer</strong>.<br/></p></div><p>Small businesses should view their choice of shipping provider as an extension of their own user experience.</p><p>And logistics companies should quickly start leaning into the value that they can provide <em><strong>their</strong></em> customers (retailers), by investing in UX.<br/></p><div><p>---</p>
