    <h1>Investing in lighting did great things for my mental and physical health</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Controlling lighting is an <strong>extremely powerful force on your daily life satisfaction.</strong></p>
<p>Used correctly it can be calming, or energy building.</p>
<p>Used incorrectly, it is an oppressive pressure on the eyes and the mind.</p>

<h2 id="yellow-lights" href="/projects/invest-in-lights#yellow-lights"> <a>Yellow Lights</a></h2>
<p>In my bedroom, I use soft yellow Edison bulbs. They&#39;re warm enough to not cause stress, but powerful enough to light up an entire room.</p>
<p>White light is best for offices during the day (<em>looking at you, pandemic years</em>) or overcast days when energy is hard to summon.</p>
<p>I keep both around the house depending on the weather forecast and my emotional state.</p>

<p>Equally important is to invest in a good set of blackout curtains or blinds (check out <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.hawkeyewindows.com/european-window-and-door/rolladen-rolling-shutters/">Rolladens if you want to go hard</a>). Getting a full night of sleep is critical, and light seeping through curtains is an easy recipe for poor sleep.</p>
<h2 id="light-mode-and-dark-mode-on-websites" href="/projects/invest-in-lights#light-mode-and-dark-mode-on-websites"> <a>Light Mode And Dark Mode on Websites</a></h2>
<p>I generally clowned on developers putting so much into building dark modes instead of critical features that prevent their apps from working, until I was working on this site on a red eye flight. The whites were <strong>blinding</strong> and the websites/apps that had dark mode were <strong>comforting</strong>.</p>
<p>I added <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/bigpanda-engineering/dark-theme-with-styled-components-a573dd898e2a">dark mode literally that flight using this tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>Consider me a convert!</p>
