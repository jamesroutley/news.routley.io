            A online manga store that sells independently published manga (doujinshi) into English. Sells all-ages, LGBT and R18 manga, but all are in separate categories and R18 material needed to be paid by credit card, so was blocked to children, even before the UK Block.

            Reddit.com; The OSA has made it impossible to do my subreddit moderation work: I need to be able to review a user&#39;s profile if they submit a post/comments to any of the subreddits I moderate. Any profile marked as &#34;18+&#34;, which DOES NOT imply pornographic content, is now blocked from view when accessing Reddit from the UK. I refuse outright to scan my face into a dodgy third-party site, so I HAVE to use a VPN to continue moderating my (medical professional) subreddits. It&#39;s insane.

            Janitor AI is a chatbot platform where users can create and interact with AI characters for personalized role-playing and conversations. It was launched in 2023 and quickly gained popularity, especially among those interested in engaging with AI in an immersive and emotional way. The platform allows for customisation of character personalities, appearances, and dialogue settings, and supports different Large Language Models (LLMs). 

The site is of 18+ maturity and is only advertised for adults. The website is based outside of the UK.

Janitor ai also has a large creative community akin to fanficton sites like Ao3 or Wattpad. Many people use this site for creative expression and connecting with other users who also enjoy the fandoms and original characters that are created on the site.

            Itch.io blocks certain pages due to the OSA. However, directly accessing the pages allows you to view content anyway. The content may or may not even be &#34;adult&#34;.

Example: Pages on itch are organised by domain with the name of an author. The main index at https://elajo.itch.io Gives a message about the OSA. But pages within can be accessed if you already know the exact path name.
