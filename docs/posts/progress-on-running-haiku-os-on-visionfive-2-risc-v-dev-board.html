    <h1>Progress on running Haiku OS on VisionFive 2 RISC-V dev board</h1>

<p>tqh summed up the problem very well. It is not so much lack of interest, but lack of time and ever changing hardware. I have over the years bought several ARM devices, and each of them became obsolete and possibly broken before I could even get started on porting Haiku to it. I still own some of them, and maybe I’ll get back to Haiku hacking on at least one (the other is way too old and it would not make sense anymore to get Haiku running there, and the architecture is very strange, 2 CPU cores of which only one has an MMU…)</p>
<p>There is no problem at all with it being a “closed” ISA (what does that even mean? That issue has been solved since at least the 6502 cloning the ISA of the Motorola 6800 but swapping the CPU pins around so it wouldn’t be fully compatible, or the z80 being a clone of the 8080 but renaming the mnemonics in the assembler so people would notice, but lawyers wouldn’t).</p>
<p>There were problems with each machine using an ARM CPU being essentially a completely different architecture, with a different UART to send debug to, a different way to program the framebuffer, and so on. When we started, even the MMU wasn’t standard and was different between various ARM generations.</p>
<p>Recently this is solved by having UEFI for all machines, meaning we can get at least the bootloader running on any machine without any new code. This benefits both RISC-V and ARM, since they have both standardized on UEFI, and as a result, the ARM port has started to make some progress again.</p>
<p>So, TL;DR: it is not a problem of closed ISA, but of lack of architecture standardization for anything but the CPU itself.</p>
