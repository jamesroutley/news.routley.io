    <h1>Say No to Palantir in the NHS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>NHS England is rolling out software to run our health records from Palantir – a US spy-tech firm that has supported mass deportation in the US and enabled genocide in Gaza.</p>
<p>One of Palantir’s founders is also openly against the NHS. Peter Thiel claimed it “makes people sick” and said that the British people love the NHS because we’re suffering from Stockholm syndrome.</p>
<p>We can’t let a company like this take control of our healthcare system.</p>
<p>But we can fight back right now. We’ve set up a simple tool so you can find out if your local NHS trust has started using the software, and then send an email demanding they say no to Palantir.</p>
<p>With the government putting NHS trusts under pressure to adopt the software, we need to act right now. <span>If you want to keep Palantir out of our NHS, send an email to your local trust and Wes Streeting, secretary of state for health.</span><b><br/>
