<p><span> </span>Law enforcement have requested OTC not disclose any more details due to it being an ongoing investigation, states the release. <span> </span></p><p><span> </span>“We will provide a more complete accounting of the incident as soon as we are able,” Higdon said. “Although the blame for this incident rests squarely on the criminals who committed this act, I want to assure you that we are doing everything in our power to ensure something like this cannot happen again. <span> </span></p><p><span> </span>“It is our hope that these criminals are swiftly brought to justice and that we are able to recover these funds. In the meantime, I want to express my profound thanks to everyone for the strong support we have received.”</p><p>OTC offers associate degrees and certificates in a variety of technical, allied health and two-year transfer degree programs, as well as workforce development opportunities.
