                  is a far cry from normal bicycle safety guides, which usually
                  tell you little more than to wear your helmet and to follow
                  the law.  But consider this for a moment: <b>Wearing a
                    helmet will do absolutely nothing to prevent you from
                    getting hit by a car.</b>  Sure, helmets might help you
                  <i>if</i> you get hit, but <b>your #1 goal should be to avoid
                    getting hit in the first place.</b>  Plenty of cyclists
                  are killed by cars <i>even though they were wearing
                    helmets.  </i>Ironically, if they had ridden <i>without</i>
                  helmets, yet followed the advice on this page, they might
                  still be alive today.  <a href="https://bicyclesafe.com/helmets.html">Don&#39;t fall
                    for the myth</a> that wearing a helmet is the first and last
                  word in biking safety.  In truth, an ounce of prevention
                  is worth a pound of cure.  It&#39;s better to not get hit.
                  That&#39;s what real bicycle safety is about.</SPAN></p>

                  safe, not by a long shot.  Here&#39;s an example: The law
                  tells you to ride as far to the right as is practicable. 
                  But if you ride too far to the right, someone exiting a parked
                  car could open their door right in front of you, and you&#39;ll be
                  less visible to motorists pulling out of driveways and parking
                  lots, and motorists coming from behind may pass you way too
                  closely in the same lane because you didn&#39;t make them change
                  lanes.  In each of these cases you were following the
                  law, but you made it easier for yourself to get hit. 
                  This page doesn&#39;t focus on the law, it focuses on how to not

                    A car is pulling out of a side street, parking lot, or
                    driveway on the right.  </b>Notice that there are
                  actually two possible kinds of collisions here:  Either
                  you&#39;re in front of the car and the car hits you, or the car
                  pulls out in front of you and you slam into it.</SPAN></p>
              <p><SPAN color="#ff0000" size="+1">How to avoid this collision:</SPAN></p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>1. Get a headlight.</b></SPAN> 
                If you&#39;re riding at night, you absolutely should be using a
                front headlight.  It&#39;s required by law, anyway.  Even
                for daytime riding, a bright white light that has a flashing
                mode can make you more visible to motorists who might otherwise
                Right Cross you.  Look for the new LED headlights which
                last ten times as long on a set of batteries as old-style
                lights.  And headlamps (mounted on your head or helmet) are
                the best, because then you can look directly at the driver to
                make <i>sure</i> they see your light.</p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>2. Wave.</b></SPAN>  If you can&#39;t
                make eye contact with the driver, wave your arm.  It&#39;s
                easier for them to see your arm going left and right than it is
                for them to see a bicycle coming straight towards them. 
                You could also use a loud horn (like the Air Zound) to get
                drivers&#39; attention.  If it looks like the driver is about
                to pull out without seeing you, yell &#34;Hey!&#34;  You may feel
                awkward waving or yelling, but it&#39;s better to be embarrassed
                than to get hit.  Incidentally, many countries require
                bells on bicycles, but the U.S. doesn&#39;t.</p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>3. Slow down.</b></SPAN>  If you
                can&#39;t make eye contact with the driver (especially at night),
                slow down so much that you&#39;re able to completely stop if you
                have to.  Sure, it&#39;s inconvenient, but it beats getting
                hit.  <i>Doing this has saved my life on too many
                  occasions to count.</i></p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>4. Ride further left.  </b></SPAN>You&#39;re
probably
                used to riding in the &#34;A&#34; line in the picture, very close to the
                curb, because you&#39;re worried about being hit from behind. 
                But take a look at the car.  When that driver is looking
                down the road for traffic, he&#39;s not looking in the bike lane or
                the area closest to the curb; he&#39;s looking in the <i>middle</i>
                of the lane, for other cars.  The farther left you are
                (such as in &#34;B&#34;), the more likely the driver will see you. 
                There&#39;s an added bonus here: if the motorist doesn&#39;t see you and
                starts pulling out, you may be able to go even <i>farther</i>
                left, or may be able to speed up and get out of the way before
                impact, or easily roll onto their hood as they slam on their
                brakes.  In short, it gives you some options.  Because
                if you stay all the way to the right and they pull out, your
                only &#34;option&#34; may be to run right into the driver&#39;s side
                door.  <i>Using this method has saved me on three
                  occasions in which a motorist ran into me slowly as they hit
                  their brakes and I wasn&#39;t hurt, and in which I definitely
                  would have slammed into the driver&#39;s side door had I not moved
                  left.</i><br/>
              </p>
              <p>You might worry that moving left makes you more vulnerable to
                cars coming from behind.  But the stats say you&#39;re far more
                likely to get hit by a car at an intersection ahead of you that
                can&#39;t see you, than from a car behind you which can see you
                clearly.  So while both positions have risk, you generally
                reduce your risk by riding a little farther left.  Your
                actual lane position depends on road conditions.  On fast
                roadways with few cross streets (and thus less chances to get
                hit at intersections), you&#39;ll ride farther to the right. 
                On slow roads with many cross streets, you&#39;ll ride farther
                left.  See <a href="https://bicyclesafe.com/index.html#laneposition">lane position</a>

                the lane that cars can&#39;t pass you easily, but you&#39;re more likely
                to get doored by a parked car if you ride too close to it than

                you&#39;re riding at night, a headlight is absolutely essential.

                    first place.</b></SPAN>  Crossing between sidewalks is
                a fairly dangerous maneuver. If you do it on the left-hand side
                of the street, you risk getting slammed as per the diagram. If
                you do it on the right-hand side of the street, you risk getting
                slammed by a car behind you that&#39;s turning right.  Sidewalk
                riding also makes you vulnerable to cars pulling out of parking
                lots or driveways.  And you&#39;re threatening to pedestrians
                on the sidewalk, who could get hurt if you hit them.  These
                kinds of accidents are hard to avoid, which is a compelling
                reason to not ride on the sidewalk in the first place.  In
                addition, riding on the sidewalk is illegal in some places.<br/>

                streets), and free of driveways and peds, then there&#39;s little
                risk to you and others.  Just make sure when you <i>do</i>
                cross a street or driveway that you <i>slow down considerably</i>

                  streets (ahead of you and to the left), which are making a
                  right onto your street, aren&#39;t expecting traffic to be coming
                  at them from the wrong way. They won&#39;t see you, and they&#39;ll
                  plow right into you.</li>
                <li>How the heck are you going to make a right turn?</li>
                <li>Cars will approach you at a much higher relative speed. If
                  you&#39;re going 15mph, then a car passing you from behind doing
                  35 approaches you at a speed of only <b>20</b> (35-15). But
                  if you&#39;re on the wrong side of the road, then the car
                  approaches you at <b>50</b> (35+15), which is <i>more than
                    twice as fast</i>!  Since they&#39;re approaching you
                  faster, both you and the driver have lots less time to
                  react.  And if a collision does occur, it&#39;s going to be
                  at a faster relative speed.</li>
                <li>Riding the wrong way is against the law and you can get
                  ticketed for it.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><b>One study showed that riding the wrong way was <i>three
                    times as dangerous</i> as riding the right way,</b> and for
                kids, the risk is <i>seven times greater.</i> <SPAN size="-2">(</SPAN><a href="http://www.bicyclinglife.com/Library/riskfactors.htm" target="_blank"><SPAN size="-2">source</SPAN></a><SPAN size="-2">)</SPAN></p>

                  </SPAN>Some readers have challenged this, saying if 25% of
                crashes are from going the wrong way, then riding the <i>right
                  way</i> is more dangerous because it accounts for 75% of
                crashes. That idea is just wrong. First off, only 8% of cyclists
                ride the wrong way, yet nearly 25% of them get hit -- meaning
                wrong-way cyclists really are three times more likely to get hit
                than those who ride the proper way. Second, the problem with
                wrong-way biking is that it <i>promotes</i> crashes, while
                right-way biking does not. For example, cyclists running stop
                signs or red lights is 17% of their crashes. <SPAN size="-2">(</SPAN><a href="http://www.bicyclinglife.com/Library/TaleOfThree.htm" target="_blank"><SPAN size="-2">source</SPAN></a><SPAN size="-2">)</SPAN> 
But
                do we therefore conclude that <i>not</i> running signals causes
                83% of crashes?! (Hint: No.)</p>

              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>Don&#39;t stop in the blind spot.</b></SPAN>
                Simply stop <i>behind</i> a car, instead of to the right of it,
                as per the diagram below. This makes you very visible to traffic
                on all sides. It&#39;s impossible for the car behind you to avoid
                seeing you when you&#39;re right in front of it.</p>
              <p><img src="https://bicyclesafe.com/images-collisions/red-light-take-lane.gif" height="213" width="220"/>Another
                option is to stop at either point A in the diagram above (where
                the first driver can see you), or at point B, behind the first
                car so it can&#39;t turn into you, and far enough ahead of the
                second car so that the second driver can see you clearly. It
                does no good to avoid stopping to the right of the first car if
                you&#39;re going to make the mistake of stopping to the right of the
                second car. EITHER car can do you in.</p>
              <p>If you chose spot A, then ride quickly to cross the street as
                soon as the light turns green. Don&#39;t look at the motorist to see
                if they want to go ahead and turn. If you&#39;re in spot A and they
                want to turn, then <i>you&#39;re in their way.</i> Why did you take
                spot A if you weren&#39;t eager to cross the street when you could?
                When the light turns green, just go, and go quickly. (But make
                sure cars aren&#39;t running the red light on the cross street, of
                course.)</p>
              <p>If you chose spot B, then when the light turns green, DON&#39;T
                pass the car in front of you -- stay behind it, because it might
                turn right at any second. If it doesn&#39;t make a right turn right
                away, it may turn right into a driveway or parking lot
                unexpectedly at any point. <i>Don&#39;t count on drivers to signal!
                </i>They don&#39;t. Assume that a car can turn right at any time.
                (NEVER pass a car on the right!) But try to stay ahead of the
                car behind you until you&#39;re through the intersection, because
                otherwise they might try to cut you off as they turn right.</p>
              <p>While we&#39;re not advocating running red lights, notice it is in
                fact safer to run the red light if there&#39;s no cross traffic,
                than it is to wait legally at the red light directly to the
                right of a car, only to have it make a right turn right into you
                when the light turns green. The moral here is not that you
                should break the law, but that you can easily get hurt even if
                you follow the law.</p>
              <p>By the way, <i>be very careful when passing stopped cars on
                  the right</i> as you approach a red light. You run the risk of
                getting doored by a passenger exiting the car on the right side,
                or hit by a car that unexpectedly decides to pull into a parking
                space on the right side of the street.</p>

              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>2. Ride to the left.</b></SPAN> Taking
                up the whole lane makes it harder for drivers to pass you to cut
                you off or turn into you. Don&#39;t feel bad about taking the lane:
                if motorists didn&#39;t threaten your life by turning in front of or
                into you or passing you too closely, then you wouldn&#39;t have to.
                If the lane you&#39;re in isn&#39;t wide enough for cars to pass you
                safely, then you should be taking the whole lane <i>anyway. </i>Lane

collision
                is very easy to avoid. Just don&#39;t pass any vehicle on the right.
                If a car ahead of you is going only 10 mph, then you slow down,
                too, behind it. It will eventually start moving faster. If it
                doesn&#39;t, pass <i>on the left</i> when it&#39;s safe to do so.</p>
              <p>When passing cyclists on the left, announce &#34;on your left&#34;
                before you start passing, so they don&#39;t suddenly move left into
                you. (Of course, they&#39;re much less likely to suddenly move left
                without looking, where they could be hit by traffic, then to
                suddenly move right, into a destination.) If they&#39;re riding too
                far to the left for you to pass safely on the left, then
                announce &#34;on your right&#34; before passing on the right.</p>
              <p>If several cars are stopped at a light, then you can try
                passing on the right <i>cautiously.</i> Remember that someone
                can fling open the passenger door unexpectedly as they exit the
                car. Also remember that if you pass on the right and traffic
                starts moving again unexpectedly, you may suffer <a href="#redlight">#3,
                  the Red Light of Death</a>.</p>
              <p>Note that when you&#39;re tailing a slow-moving vehicle, ride
                behind it, <a href="#redlight">not in its blind spot</a>
                immediately to the right of it. Even if you&#39;re not passing a car
                on the right, you could still run into it if it turns right
                while you&#39;re right next to it. Give yourself enough room to
                brake if it turns.</p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>2. Look behind you before turning
                    right.</b> </SPAN>Here&#39;s your opportunity to avoid hitting

                right. Look behind you before making a right-hand turn to make
                sure a bike isn&#39;t trying to pass you. (Also remember that they
                could be coming up from behind you on the sidewalk while you&#39;re
                on the street.) Even if it&#39;s the other cyclist&#39;s fault for
                trying to pass you on the right when you make a right turn and
                have them slam into you, it won&#39;t hurt any less when they hit

                you&#39;re riding at night, you should absolutely use a front
                headlight. It&#39;s required by law in most countries, anyway.</p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>3. Wear something bright, even during
                    the day.</b></SPAN> It may seem silly, but bikes are small

                reflective vests really make a big difference. Reflective leg

                Don&#39;t overtake slow-moving vehicles on the right. Doing so makes

                Passing on the right means that the vehicle you&#39;re passing could

              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>1. Never, ever move left without
                    looking behind you first.</b></SPAN> Some motorists like to
                pass cyclists within mere inches, so moving even a tiny bit to
                the left unexpectedly could put you in the path of a car.
                Practice holding a straight line while looking over your
                shoulder until you can do it perfectly. Most new cyclists tend
                to move left when they look behind them, which of course can be
                disastrous.</p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>2. Don&#39;t swerve in and out of the

                might be tempted to ride in the parking lane where there are no
                parked cars, dipping back into the traffic lane when you
                encounter a parked car. This puts you at risk for getting nailed
                from behind. Instead, ride a steady, straight line in the

                  shop</a> right now. There are models that fit on your
                handlebars, helmet, or glasses, as you prefer. You should always
                physically look back over your shoulder before moving left, but
                having a mirror still helps you monitor traffic without
                constantly having to look behind you.</p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>4. Signal.</b></SPAN> Never move left
                without signaling. Just put your left arm straight out. Be sure

                    fear the most, but it&#39;s actually not very common, comprising

                  likely greater at night, and in rides outside the city where
                  traffic is faster and lighting is worse. The three cyclists
                  killed when hit from behind in Austin in 96-97 were all riding
                  at night, and at least two of them didn&#39;t have lights on their

                  The best way to avoid getting Rear-Ended is to ride on very
                  wide roads or in bike lanes, or on roads where the traffic
                  moves slowly, and to use lights when biking at night.</SPAN></p>
              <p><SPAN color="#ff0000" size="+1">How to avoid this collision:</SPAN></p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>1. Get a rear light.</b></SPAN> If
                you&#39;re riding at night, you <b>absolutely</b> should use a
                flashing red rear light. Bruce Mackey (formerly of Florida, now
                head of bike safety in Nevada) says that <b>60% of bike
                  collisions in Florida are caused by cyclists riding at night
                  without lights.</b> In 1999, 39% of deaths on bicycles
                nationwide occurred between 6 p.m. and midnight. [USA Today,
                10-22-01, attributed to the Insurance Institute for highway
                safety]</p>
              <p>Bike shops have red rear blinkies for $15 or less. These kind
                of lights typically take two AA batteries, which last for months
                (something like 200 hours). <b>I can&#39;t stress this item enough:
                  If you ride at night, get a rear light!</b></p>
              <p><img src="https://bicyclesafe.com/images/triangle-glow-small.jpg" height="220" width="155"/><SPAN color="#660099"><b>2.
                    Wear a reflective vest or a safety triangle.</b></SPAN> High
                quality reflective gear makes you a lot more visible even in the
                day time, not just at night. I had a friend ride away from me
                while wearing one during the day, and when she was about a
                quarter mile away, I couldn&#39;t see her or her bike at all, but
                the vest was clearly visible. At night the difference is even
                greater. Bike shops have vests and triangles for $10 to $15.
                Also, when you hear a motorist approaching, straightening up
                into a vertical position will make your reflective gear more
                noticeable.</p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>3. Choose wide streets.</b></SPAN>
                Ride on streets whose outside lane is so wide that it can easily
                fit a car and a bike side by side. That way a car may zoom by
                you and avoid hitting you, <i>even if they didn&#39;t see you!</i></p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>4. Choose slow streets.</b></SPAN> The
                slower a car is going, the more time the driver has to see you.
                I navigate the city by going through neighborhoods. Learn how to
                do this.</p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>5. Use back streets on weekends.</b></SPAN>
                The risk of riding on Friday or Saturday night is much greater
                than riding on other nights because all the drunks are out
                driving around. If you do ride on a weekend night, make sure to
                take neighborhood streets rather than arterials.</p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>6. Get a mirror</b></SPAN><b>.</b> Get
                a <b>mirror</b> and use it. If it looks like a car doesn&#39;t see
                you, hop off your bike and onto the sidewalk. Mirrors cost
                $5-15. Trust me, once you&#39;ve ridden a mirror for a while, you&#39;ll
                wonder how you got along without it. My paranoia went down 80%
                after I got a mirror. If you&#39;re not convinced, after you&#39;ve used
                your mirror for a month, take it off your bike and ride around
                and notice how you keep glancing down to where your mirror was,
                and notice how unsafe you feel without it.</p>
              <p><SPAN color="#660099"><b>7. Don&#39;t hug the curb</b></SPAN><b>.</b>
                This is counter-intuitive, but give yourself a little space
                between yourself and the curb. That gives you some room to move
                into in case you see a large vehicle in your mirror approaching
                without moving over far enough to avoid you. Also, when you hug
                the curb tightly you&#39;re more likely to suffer a <a href="#rightcross">right
                  cross</a> from motorists who can&#39;t see you.</p>

              <p>Fantastic web site!  I&#39;ve been a bicycle commuter for
                about 13 years now and I think you&#39;ve nailed it very
                nicely.  I was recently clipped <b>while passing a
                  slow-moving truck and trailer on the right</b> in a
                dedicated right-turn lane.  I&#39;ve ridden the same route for
                over 6 years but failed to follow your advice about busy roads
                [and about not passing on the right!]. During that time traffic
                got worse and worse while I became more and more
                complacent.  While passing that truck and trailer, a dually
                pickup passing me up on my left, caught my handlebar with
                its rear flared out fender, and took me down in a busy
                intersection.  We were both going about the same speed so
                it was the pavement that did the hurting, but we were doing
                about 30mph.  My helmet was crushed from the impact and I
                broke 3 ribs along with the usual road rash and a perforation in
                one arm from some road debris.  Obviously I was lucky, the
                helmet worked so well, I didn&#39;t even gat a headache.  But
                it points out the need to reassess your route periodically and
                be willing to change your route accordingly.  <SPAN color="#666666"><i>--Adam

              <p>I just read your BicycleSafe article. I&#39;ve been riding in
                cities (mainly Cleveland and Winnipeg) for 45 years or so. I&#39;ve
                experienced all of the types of incident you describe.
                Fortunately I only got knocked off the bike once many years ago
                - a left cross in a thunderstorm going too fast with a gale
                behind me - dummy! Bike brakes don&#39;t work as well in the rain
                and drivers don&#39;t have the visibility.</p>
              <p>I&#39;d encourage cyclists to keep the speed below about 15 MPH in
                city traffic. At that speed, I find I have the reaction time and
                stopping distance to handle most emergencies.</p>
              <p>Thanks for posting the article. I bet you save a few lives! <SPAN color="#666666"><i>--Alan

                          microscope, piece by piece. Author Robert Hurst
                          discusses how, in America, bicyclists were an
                          afterthought at best when our cities were planned and
                          built, and today are left to navigate through a hard
                          and unsympathetic world that was not made for
                          them--like rats in a sewer. Yet, with the proper
                          attitude and a bit of knowledge, urban cyclists will
                          thrive in this hostile environment. The primary
                          concern is safety, but this book goes well beyond the
                          usual tips and how-to, diving in to the realms of
                          history, psychology, sociology, and economics. It
                          empowers readers with the Big Picture of urban
                          cycling--and gives urban cyclists many useful insights
                          to consider while pedaling the next commute or grocery
                          run. Riding a bike in the city will never be the same.

              <p>I have developed this page to provide what I believe is very
                good advice to help you avoid getting hit by cars. But of
                course, bicycling will never be 100% safe, and I can&#39;t guarantee
                you won&#39;t get hit by a car, even if you follow all the advice on
                this page. (Naturally, I believe if you follow this advice you
                will be much less likely to suffer a collision than if you
                ignore it.) Ultimately, you are responsible for your own safety.</p>
