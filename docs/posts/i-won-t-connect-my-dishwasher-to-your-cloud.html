    <h1>I won&#39;t connect my dishwasher to your cloud</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This weekend I had to buy a new dishwasher because our old GE died.</p>

<p>I bought a Bosch 500 series because that&#39;s what Consumer Reports recommended, and more importantly, I could find one in stock.</p>

<p>After my dad and I got it installed, I went to run a rinse cycle, only to find that <em>that</em>, along with features like delayed start and eco mode, require an app.</p>

<p>Not only that, to <em>use</em> the app, you have to connect your dishwasher to WiFi, set up a cloud account in something called Home Connect, and then, and only then, can you start using all the features on the dishwasher.</p>

<p>So getting back first to that old GE dishwasher, it was, I don&#39;t know, I think that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">planned obsolescence</a> is something that applies to many consumer products today.</p>

<p>Companies know if they design something to last only 5 or 10 years, that means in 5 or 10 years someone&#39;s going to have to buy a whole new one.</p>

<p>And on my GE Amana dishwasher, it started having weird power issues, like the controls would just not light up unless I reset the circuit breaker for a few minutes. That started happening more often, and this past Saturday it just wouldn&#39;t come on no matter what, even after I tested and re-wired it all the way from the panel up to the dishwasher&#39;s internal power connector.</p>

<p>So it was dead.</p>

<p>Next up, I looked at what it took to get a control board. Well... <a href="https://www.repairclinic.com/PartDetail/Control-Board/WD21X24901C/4980378">$299 for a control board</a> that was &#39;special order&#39; and might not even fix the problem? That&#39;s a non-starter for my $600, 8-year-old dishwasher.</p>

<p>Even if I got it fixed, the front panel was starting to rust out at the hinge points (leaving some metal jaggies that my soon-to-be-crawling 6 month old could slice his fingers on), and other parts of the machine were showing signs of rust/potential future leaks...</p>

<p>It was Saturday night, and for a family of five, a dishwasher is kinda important. We don&#39;t have 1.5 hours every night to spend hand-washing dishes (not to mention the water bill!).</p>

<p>So I needed to get a new one, and it&#39;s really hard for me to schedule a few hours for my Dad and I to get it done in the middle of the week (plus that&#39;s multiple days without a dishwasher!).</p>

<p>So I did some research, and I found Bosch <em>seemed</em> to have the best bet for under $1,000, available locally on a Sunday.</p>

<p>Consumer Reports, random Redditors, etc. seemed to have some praises for Bosch—on Reddit many also praised Miele, but I couldn&#39;t find any of those available locally. And Consumer Reports especially praised <em>all</em> the Bosch units, with them topping all their reliability and customer satisfaction charts!</p>

<p>I remembered five or ten years ago, whenever I had bought my old GE, I remembered Bosch topped the charts too, but back then I settled for GE to save a few bucks...</p>

<h2>Installation was (mostly) great!</h2>

<p>So I spent a little more this time, hoping for a better experience. And installation was actually great—it was a lot easier to install the Bosch than it was that the GE.</p>

<p>It has a plastic base that slides better on the floor, and there&#39;s easier routing of the drain hose, inlet hose, and power wire that makes it less risky when you&#39;re pushing the thing into the blind cutout under the counter.</p>

<p>The one weird thing was that whoever like tightened the feet on the bottom at the factory must&#39;ve used an impact driver or something because they were all practically embedded, and wouldn&#39;t budge.</p>

<p>I was turning the little screw on the front that pushes the rear foot down through a little gearing, but the worm gear slipped out and kinda shoved the long rod that connects the front to the back out of place. I had to buy a 10mm hex socket to wiggle the foot loose enough the gearing would actually work.</p>

<p>But once that was done, the rest of the install was seamless. (Thanks especially to some help from my Dad).</p>

<h2>First use, encountering the Cloud requirement</h2>

<p>So I turned it on, and immediately hated the new touch sensor stuff on it.</p>

<p>The old GE had buttons: you press them in, they click and you know that you pressed a button.</p>

<p>The touch sensor, you kind of touch it and the firmware—like this new dishwasher actually takes time to boot up! I had to reset it like three times and my wife meanwhile was like laughing at me like look at this guy who does tech stuff and he can&#39;t even figure out how to change the cycle on it.</p>

<p>That took about five minutes, sadly.</p>

<p>But eventually I pulled out the manual book because I was like... &#34;this is actually confusing.&#34;</p>

<p>It should be like: I touch the button and it changes to that mode! But that was not how it was working.</p>

<p>I wanted to run just a rinse cycle to make sure the water would go in, the water would pump out through the sump, and everything worked post-install.</p>

<p>But I couldn&#39;t find a way to do a rinse cycle on the control panel.</p>

<p>So I looked in the manual and found this note:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/bosch-dishwasher-manual-features-home-connect.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b39c0aae-ac8e-4760-9392-88c7efa29bd6" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;b39c0aae-ac8e-4760-9392-88c7efa29bd6&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Bosch dishwasher manual mention of Home Connect"/></p>

<p>It says options with an asterisk—including Rinse, Machine Care (self-cleaning), HalfLoad, Eco, and Delay start, are &#34;available through Home Connect app only and depending on your model.&#34;</p>

<p>The 500 series model I bought isn&#39;t premium enough to feature a 7-segment display like the $400-more-expensive <em>800</em> series, so these fancy modes are hidden behind an app and cloud service.</p>

<p>I was like, &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll look up this app and see if I can use it over Bluetooth or locally or whatever.&#34;</p>

<p>Nope! To use the app, you have to connect your <em>dishwasher</em> to your <em>Wi-Fi</em>, which lets the dishwasher reach out on the internet to this Home Connect service.</p>

<p>You have to set up an account on Home Connect, set up the Home Connect app on your phone, and <em>then</em> you can control your dishwasher <em>through the Internet</em> to run a rinse cycle.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make any sense to me.</p>

<p>An app? I mean, I can understand maybe adding some neat convenience features for those <em>who want them</em>. Like on my new fridge—which I chose not to connect to WiFI—it has an app that would allow me to monitor the inside temperature or look up service codes more easily. If I wanted those add-on features, which my old fridge didn&#39;t have, I could get them.</p>

<p>But requiring an app to access features that <em>used</em> to be controllable via buttons on the dishwasher itself—or <em>are still</em> if you pay $400 more for the fancy &#34;800&#34; model? That&#39;s <em>no bueno</em>.</p>

<h2>What can I do?</h2>

<p>Well, first of all, I could just not use those features. That&#39;s kind of annoying because I bought it with the assumption that I could run the cleaning cycle, that I could run the rinse cycle without having to have an app and Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>Another option is I could just connect it to my Wi-Fi, maybe on an IoT VLAN.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not like a video doorbell, where an Internet connection adds on functionality, like being able to see who rang while you&#39;re on vacation, or storing security footage clips on the cloud so you have them available even after someone robs your house...</p>

<p>But a dishwasher... I&#39;m not going to remote control my dishwasher and like, run an extra rinse cycle while I&#39;m on a beach somewhere.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need Internet on my dishwasher.</p>

<p>Another <em>third</em> option is somebody has reverse engineered this protocol and built <a href="https://github.com/osresearch/hcpy">HCPY</a>, a Home Connect Python library.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s the problem: I already spent like four hours getting this dishwasher installed in my kitchen. I don&#39;t want to spend another four hours configuring my own web UI for it—which still requires at least a one-time connection through Home Connect!—and maintaining that as a service on my local network, relying on an unauthorized third party library using reverse-engineering to get at the private dishwasher API!</p>

<h2>What can <em>we</em> do?</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t think we should let vendors get away with this stuff.</p>

<p>First, it lets product designers get lazy.</p>

<p>A feature like a little display, a little seven segment display that can show like two letters and a number of minutes remaining or something like that... How much does that cost?</p>

<p>How hard is it to integrate that into every model, even the cheap ones?</p>

<p>A lot of cheap dishwashers actually <em>have</em> those things, but not Bosch!</p>

<p>With Bosch, you have to pay $400 for the privilege of a little display!</p>

<p>Second, this might be a little bit conspiracy theory or whatever, but it feels like it&#39;s part of planned obsolescence. Just like with the GE, where a lot of parts are designed to rust out after 5 or 10 years.</p>

<p>If you have a cloud app, that means there&#39;s a cloud service that has to be running. That costs money to maintain.</p>

<p>And if there&#39;s no subscription fee right now, that means one of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>They could be selling our data already.</li>
<li>At some point, they&#39;ll either close the service because it&#39;s a cost center (so the rinse cycle and eco mode on all these dishwashers just goes &#34;POOF!&#34;), <em>or</em> they&#39;re going move to a subscription model.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of a sudden, if you want to run the self-cleaning cycle, you better start paying five bucks to Bosch every month. <em>Forever</em>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s insane.</p>

<p>Third, it&#39;s a security hole in your local network.</p>

<p>Bosch might be a <em>little</em> better than some no-name light bulb company making IoT light bulbs on Amazon, but only a little.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to have Bosch having full internet access on my local network.</p>

<p>Their API would be able to talk back to my dishwasher, and the dishwasher—unless I put it on a VLAN, which 99% of consumers have no clue how to do that...</p>

<p>That&#39;s just something that shouldn&#39;t have to happen.</p>

<p>This is a dishwasher!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know.</p>

<h2>What <em>should</em> be done?</h2>

<p>When I posted on social media about this, a lot of people told me to return it.</p>

<p>But I spent four hours installing this thing built into my kitchen.</p>

<p>I hooked it up to the water, it&#39;s running through cycles... it <em>is</em> working. I&#39;ll give them that. It does the normal stuff, but you know, there are some features that don&#39;t work without the app.</p>

<p>At a minimum, I think what Bosch should do is make it so that the dishwasher can be accessed locally with no requirement for a cloud account. (Really, it&#39;d be even better to have all the functions accessible on the control panel!)</p>

<p>Anyone building an IoT device, here is my consumer-first, e-waste-reduction maxim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>First local, <em>then</em> cloud.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cloud should be an add-on.</p>

<p>It should be a convenience for people who don&#39;t know how to do things like connect to their dishwasher with an app locally.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not <em>that</em> hard.</p>

<p>A little ESP32, a little $1 chip that you can put in there could do all this stuff locally with no cloud requirement at all.</p>

<p>I think that there might be some quants or people who want to make a lot of money building all these cloud services.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s people who are consumer-first and eco-conscious because if they were, they would give <em>us</em> control first and <em>then</em> add on &#39;nice&#39; quality of life features through a cloud service.</p>

<p>With my Bosch 500 series dishwasher, I was excited after the easy install (besides those leveling feet), then was let down <em>so hard</em> once I found out I couldn&#39;t use all the features it came with.</p></div></div>
