    <h1>Bring Bathroom Doors Back to Hotels</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’m done. I’m done arriving at hotels and discovering that they have removed the bathroom door. Something that should be as standard as having a bed, has been sacrificed in the name of “aesthetic”.</p>



<p>I get it, you can save on material costs and make the room feel bigger, but what about my dignity??? I can’t save that when you don’t include a bathroom door.</p>



<p>It’s why I’ve built this website, where I compiled hotels that are guaranteed to have bathroom doors, and hotels that need to work on privacy. </p>



<p>I’ve emailed hundreds of hotels and I asked them two things: do your doors close all the way, and are they made of glass? Everyone that says yes to their doors closing, and no to being made of glass has been sorted by price range and city for you to easily find places to stay that are <strong><em>guaranteed</em></strong> to have a bathroom door.</p>







<hr/>



<p>Quickly check to see if the hotel you’re thinking of booking has been reported as lacking in doors by a previous guest.</p>







<hr/>



<p>Finally, this passion project could not exist without people submitting hotels without bathroom doors for public shaming. If you’ve stayed at a doorless hotel send me an email with the hotel name to bringbackdoors@gmail.com, or send me a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bring_back_doors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DM on Instagram</a> with the hotel name and a photo of the doorless setup to be publicly posted.</p>



<p>Let’s name and shame these hotels to protect the dignity of future travelers.</p>
