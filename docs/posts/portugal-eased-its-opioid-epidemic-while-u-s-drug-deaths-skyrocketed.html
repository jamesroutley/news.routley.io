    <h1>Portugal eased its opioid epidemic, while U.S. drug deaths skyrocketed</h1>

        <p>Talk to people addicted to street drugs in Lisbon, Portugal&#39;s capital, and you hear confusion and dismay over the carnage of overdose deaths taking place an ocean away in the U.S.</p><p>Ana Batista, a soft-spoken woman in her 50s who&#39;s been addicted to heroin for years, said she hasn&#39;t lost a single friend or family member to a fatal overdose.</p><p>&#34;No, no, no,&#34; she said, speaking at a safe drug consumption clinic, where she had come to inject under the supervision of nurses and counselors.</p><p>Liliana Santos, 41, a woman with a sad weathered face who had come to the clinic to smoke heroin, voiced similar bafflement.</p><p>Had she lost friends or family? &#34;No.&#34; Had she overdosed herself? She shook her head: &#34;No, no.&#34;</p><p>The contrast is striking. In the U.S., drug deaths are shatteringly common, killing roughly 112,000 people a year. In Portugal, weeks sometimes go by in the entire country without a single fatal overdose.</p><p>Portugal has roughly the same population as the state of New Jersey. But while New Jersey alone sees <a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/populationhealth/opioid/sudors.shtml">nearly </a>3,000 fatal drug overdoses a year, Portugal averages <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2023/us-overdose-deaths-remain-higher-other-countries-how-harm-reduction-programs-could-help#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20overdose%20mortality%20rate,%25%20between%202019%20and%202021).">around 80</a>.  </p>

In the late 1990s, the country faced an explosion of heroin use. The drug was causing roughly 350 overdose deaths a year and sparked a wave of HIV/AIDS and other diseases linked to dirty needles.</p><p>Portugal&#39;s leaders responded by pivoting away from the U.S. drug war model, which prioritized narcotics seizures, arrests and lengthy prison sentences for drug offenders.</p><p>Instead, Portugal focused scarce public dollars on health care, drug treatment, job training and housing. The system, integrated into the country&#39;s taxpayer-funded national health care system, is free and relatively easy to navigate. </p><p>&#34;Someone who has problematic drug use isn&#39;t someone who is a criminal or someone who has a moral failing,&#34; Moniz said, describing Portugal&#39;s official view of addiction.  </p><p>&#34;They&#39;re someone who has a health problem, a physical or a mental health problem,&#34; he said. &#34;That&#39;s a tremendous societal shift.&#34;</p><p>Many U.S. drug policy experts who&#39;ve studied the Portugal model say it&#39;s clear parts of it worked far better than the tough-on-crime philosophy embraced by U.S. </p><p>&#34;I think they showed that when you make [addiction treatment] services extremely available to people who are struggling with problems of drugs, you get a lot of good outcomes,&#34; said Dr. Keith Humphreys, an addiction expert at Stanford University.</p><h3>&#34;The police is always our friend&#34;</h3><p>There&#39;s one other big difference. Beginning in 2001, Portugal&#39;s national addiction strategy decriminalized personal drug use and reinvented the role of police.  </p><p>Cops still work aggressively to break up major drug gangs and arrest people committing drug-related crimes like theft. They also disrupt open-air drug markets like the ones that have emerged in some U.S. cities. </p><p>But when street cops in Portugal encounter people using small, personal-use amounts of drugs, there&#39;s no arrest. Instead, police <a href="https://www.sicad.pt/BK/Dissuasao/Documents/AS%20report%20GATEWAYS%20FROM%20CRIME%20TO%20HEALTH.pdf">schedule meetings for drug users with teams of counselors</a>. </p><p>While these sessions aren&#39;t compulsory, police are trained in strategies designed to encourage people to attend.</p><p>&#34;In the beginning, most policemen were very, very skeptical about this policy,&#34; said Artur Vaz, who leads Portugal&#39;s national police unit focused on drug trafficking.</p><p>In the U.S., this role for law enforcement, serving as a bridge to social service programs, has faced a backlash and is often seen as ineffectual.</p><p>In Oregon, for example, where small amounts of drugs were decriminalized in 2020, police regularly hand out information cards referring people to a drug counseling hotline. Court data shows drug users rarely call.</p><p>In Portugal, by contrast, government data shows roughly 90% of people referred to drug counseling sessions by police do turn up, at least for an initial session. </p><p>&#34;Most [Portuguese] police have come to believe this is a balanced approach,&#34; Vaz said. &#34;People who consume drugs should be treated by the health system, not the criminal system.&#34; </p><p>As a consequence, people living with addiction face far less stigma, rarely serve jail or prison time, and don&#39;t live with criminal records.</p><p>Ronnie Duchandre, who is addicted to alcohol and hashish and sometimes smokes crack cocaine on the streets of Lisbon, told NPR he views police as helpful.</p><p>&#34;The police is always our friend, as long as you speak with them properly,&#34; Duchandre said. With support from Portugal&#39;s system, he predicted that he would recover from his drug use.  </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s not in one day that we reach the bottom,&#34; he said. &#34;We can also go up and it&#39;s the same process, slowly up and up.&#34;</p><p>Dr. João Goulão, Portugal&#39;s national drug czar, said street cops have emerged as a vital link between the most vulnerable drug users, like Duchandre, and opportunities for treatment.</p><p>&#34;Through the intervention of police, this is a unique opportunity to meet face-to-face with people we otherwise would not see,&#34; he said.</p><h3>Portugal&#39;s formula: less stigma, fewer penalties, access to care</h3><p>Police referrals are only one of many pathways to drug treatment in Portugal. </p><p>&#34;Decriminalizing drug use is a good step,&#34; Goulão said. &#34;The more you have other kinds of responses available, the better.&#34;  </p><p>Experts here say people who use drugs are constantly nudged toward health care and addiction treatment, including methadone programs and housing.</p><p>The results are striking. Over the last 20 years, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/911927/drug-overdose-deaths-in-portugal/">Portugal cut drug deaths by 80%</a> and reduced<a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/11-07-2018-portugal-on-fast-track-to-achieve-hiv-targets-ahead-of-2020-deadline#:~:text=New%20HIV%20infections%20were%20halved,AIDS%20surveillance%20in%20Europe%202017%E2%80%9D."> the number of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis cases</a> in half.</p><p>During that same period, U.S. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db457-tables.pdf#1">drug deaths exploded</a> by more than 500%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p><a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2022/02/stanford-lancet-report-opioid-crisis.html">Researchers predict unless America somehow changes course</a>, the overdose crisis will kill a total of 2.2 million people in the U.S. by the end of this decade.</p><h3>Could elements of Portugal&#39;s system save lives in the U.S.? </h3><p>A debate is underway in the U.S. over whether elements of Portugal&#39;s system could save lives here.</p><p>&#34;If we stopped arrests and did nothing else, that&#39;s a positive intervention because of the well-documented harms of incarceration [on people with addiction],&#34; said Morgan Godvin, a former heroin user who now studies drug policy in Portland, Ore.</p><p>A growing number of cities and states around the U.S. have begun to de-emphasize drug war-era policies, shifting away from drug arrests and funding more treatment.  </p><p>California voters approved Proposition 14 a decade ago, reducing drug possession from a felony to a misdemeanor. In 2020, Oregon voters decriminalized personal-use amounts of drugs and provided more funding for health care and counseling. </p><p>Advocates of those changes hoped they would quickly reduce drug deaths and serve as a model for the rest of the U.S., but implementation has been rocky, and in many places fatal overdoses have risen.</p><p>Critics say drugs were fully or partially decriminalized before other social programs, like the ones in Portugal, were in place and widely available to pick up the slack. </p><p>&#34;We still suck at access to voluntary treatment,&#34; Godvin acknowledged, speaking of drug policy reforms in Oregon. &#34;We need a vast voluntary system, so that people can engage with treatment when they want it.&#34; </p><h3>A tidal wave of U.S. drug deaths and a backlash against programs designed to help them</h3><p>Drug policy experts say these relatively new experiments have been crippled by a lack of funding, by strict U.S. drug laws that make some harm reduction measures illegal, and by this country&#39;s complicated, costly and often poorly regulated addiction treatment system.</p><p>The spread of deadly fentanyl and a national surge in homelessness have also led to a spike in highly visible drug use, sparking a backlash among many voters and politicians who want streets, neighborhoods and parks cleaned up quickly.</p><p>There are now efforts underway to recriminalize drugs, and toughen law enforcement&#39;s response, in California and Oregon.</p>

He says the data shows Portugal&#39;s approach, combining decriminalization and health care, is more humane and more successful.</p><p>People in Portugal are now 45 times less likely to die from drug overdoses, compared with people in the U.S. — and street crime in cities like Lisbon has dropped.</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s an impression in the U.S. that if you decriminalize drugs, it&#39;s a Wild West where everyone uses drugs,&#34; Moniz said. &#34;That hasn&#39;t been the case in Portugal.&#34;</p><p>But as the death toll from the U.S. overdose crisis mounts, Moniz voiced skepticism that American policymakers will have the political will or patience to pivot to a focus on health care and social services.</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s a different political environment in the U.S,&#34; Moniz said. &#34;The way health care is funded is completely different. The role of police in American society is different. So to talk about the Portuguese experience [being adopted in the U.S.] is complicated.&#34;</p>
