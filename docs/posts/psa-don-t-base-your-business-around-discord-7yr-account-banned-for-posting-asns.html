    <h1>PSA: Don&#39;t base your business around Discord.7yr account banned for posting ASNs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>There&#39;s been a trend of startups basing their entire business on Discord like Midjourney AI, and Discord themselves pushing for people to do so with their subscriptions system.</p><p>Well just a few days ago I found out that my account of 7 years was just banned without a warning for a very obvious error on their part. Just hours before my account was banned I posted a list of ASNs (basically ISPs) connected to a non-discord server I had that looked like this:</p><p>22773  ASN-CXA-ALL-CCI-22773-RDC, US</p><p>5432   PROXIMUS-ISP-AS, BE</p><p>577    BACOM, CA</p><p>To someone who doesn&#39;t know what ASNs are, they would probably assume they are addresses. This is not personal information, and there&#39;s no way to tie this information to any individual.</p><p>I opened a ticket and the only reply I get is that the ban will not be reversed and that the account will be deleted in 14 days. I&#39;ve tried posting on Twitter and they have selectively ignored me while replying to everyone else. Any submission I make on the subreddit gets instantly deleted.</p><p>Screenshots for proof.</p><p>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F49XZ4zaEAA_7mR?format=png&amp;name=small</p><p>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F49XZ4zaEAErD3J?format=png&amp;name=small</p><p>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F49XtAiaEAMmDdK?format=png&amp;name=900x900</p><p>This also isn&#39;t the first issue we&#39;ve had with Discord. They threatened to delete my server a few years ago because 1 person said they were underage amongst thousands of lines of chat and we did not see it and ban them. They refused to tell us who it was so I had to spend hours looking through chat to find the offending user.</p><p>Think twice before you decide to base your business around Discord.</p></div></div></div>
