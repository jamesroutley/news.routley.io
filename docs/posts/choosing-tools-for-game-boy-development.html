Please note that the Game Boy Advance also functions as a Game Boy Color, so if you only have a GBA, you can use it for both GB and GBC development.</p></div><p>When someone wants to make their own game, one of the first problems they will encounter is picking the <em>tools</em> they will use. There current main options are:</p><ul><li>RGBDS (Rednex Game Boy Development System) and the Game Boy&#39;s Assembly language (ASM)</li><li>GBDK-2020 (Game Boy Development Kit) and the C language</li><li>ZGB (an engine built on GBDK-2020) and the C language</li><li>GB Studio (a drag-and-drop game creator with scripting)</li></ul><p>The purpose of this document is to provide some insights and help you make the better choice if you&#39;re starting a new project. I will also provide some &#34;good practice&#34; tips, both for C and ASM, if you have already made up your mind or are already using one of these.</p><p>The original Game Boy, codenamed the DMG, has a 1 MHz CPU [the CPU is actually clocked at 4 MHz, but every instruction takes up a multiple of 4 clocks, so it&#39;s often simplified to a 1 MHz CPU]. Given that an instruction takes approximately 2 to 3 cycles, this gives the CPU a capacity of 333,000~500,000 instructions per second. Its LCD boasts 60 fps [it&#39;s actually 59.73 fps], which rounds up to between 50,000 and 80,000 instructions per frame. Suddenly not so much, eh? It also has 8 kB of RAM, and 8 kB of video RAM ; a 160x144 px LCD (thus slightly wider than it&#39;s tall), 4 colors, and 4-channel audio.</p><p>The Super Game Boy adds a few minor things, such as a customizable screen border, and some crude color. It&#39;s also slightly faster than the DMG.</p><p>The Game Boy Color <em>can</em> [if you tell it to] unlock additional functionality, such as more fleshed-out color, a double-speed CPU, twice the video RAM and <em>four times</em> the RAM! (With caveats, obviously.)</p><p>The choice of programming language is important and can have a very large effect on a project. It determines how much work is involved, what will be possible, and how fast it will be able to run.</p><h3 id="assembly-asm" tabindex="-1"><a href="#assembly-asm" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Assembly (ASM)</h3><p>Most games and programs for the Game Boy written in ASM will use RGBDS or WLA-DX.</p><p>Strengths:</p><ul><li>Not too difficult to learn.</li><li>Extremely powerful and flexible.</li><li>When well written it allows for maximum speed and efficiency on the limited resources of the Game Boy hardware.</li></ul><p>Weaknesses:</p><ul><li>It takes a special kind of work to write optimized ASM code.</li><li>It&#39;s quite verbose and sometimes tedious.</li><li>Will require more time and learning to get up and running when compared with C.</li><li>Code may not be easily shared with ports of a game on other platforms.</li></ul><h3 id="c" tabindex="-1"><a href="#c" aria-hidden="true">#</a> C</h3><p>C will typically be used with the SDCC compiler and GBDK-2020 or ZGB, though it can also be used on it’s own without a framework or with a different compiler/dev kit (such as <a href="https://github.com/z88dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">z88dk<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><!--[--><span>open in new window</span><!--]--></span></a>).</p><p>Strengths:</p><ul><li>Allows for getting up and running faster than with ASM, especially when building on top of GBDK-2020 and ZGB.</li><li>The language abstractions make it relatively easy to implement ideas and algorithms.</li><li>C source debugging is available through Emulicious with the VSCode debug adapter, making it easier to understand problems if they arise.</li><li>ASM can be included in projects with C, either standalone or inline for speed critical features.</li></ul><p>Weaknesses:</p><ul><li>The SDCC C compiler won&#39;t always generate code that runs as fast as skilled, hand-optimized assembly. It has matured a lot in the 20 years since the original GBDK, but bugs still turns up on occasion. On a platform with a slow CPU such as the Game Boy this can be a factor.</li><li>It’s easier to write inefficient code in C without realizing it. The Game Boy&#39;s CPU is only capable of performing 8-bit addition or subtraction, or 16-bit addition. Using <code>INT32</code>s is quite taxing on the CPU (it needs to do two consecutive 16-bit adds, and add the carry). See the tips below to avoid such blunders.</li><li>There is overhead due to C being a stack-oriented language, whereas the Game Boy&#39;s CPU is rather built for a register-oriented strategy. This most notably makes passing function arguments a lot slower, although SDCC has some optimizations for this.</li></ul><h3 id="non-programming-language-option" tabindex="-1"><a href="#non-programming-language-option" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Non-Programming Language option</h3><p>Using a GUI instead- If you don’t want to learn a programming language in order to make Game Boy games, then GB Studio is an option.
