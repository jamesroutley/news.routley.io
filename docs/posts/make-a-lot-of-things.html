    <h1>Make a Lot of Things</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>Rick Rubin is a fascinating character. The other day, I watched a clip from an interview he did with Andre 3000 of Outkast. They were talking about making music. I was stuck by something he said.</p>
<p>Andre: “I haven’t been making much music man. My focus is not there. My confidence is not there. I’d like to, but it’s just not coming.</p>
<p>Rick: “I think you start making a lot of things with no thinking. What it’s supposed to be or whose it for or what anyone else is gonna think. But just get in the habit of making a lot.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I gotta get back to.”</p>
<p>“Yea, just make a lot. And then, at some point in that process, you’ll be like, ‘hmmm, I really like this.’ And you didn’t know. Through that whole process, you don’t know when that’s gonna happen.”</p>
<p>“Yea.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a decision you make and it’s not an intellectual idea where, I have a vision and I’m gonna make this thing. It doesn’t happen like that... it rarely happens like that. It happens more just having fun, making things. No stakes.”</p>
<p>Here&#39;s one of the most influential hip-hop artists of all time saying he&#39;s having trouble making good music. Rick essentially says, don&#39;t worry about it. Don&#39;t even think about it. Just get in the habit of making a lot of things, with no thought as to who they&#39;re for or what they should be. That&#39;s when the good things will come.</p>
<p>Rick has worked with the most prolific artists of our time. Including ones, such as Kanye, that seem to have a clear vision and execute it. Yet he is saying, it rarely happens like that. It&#39;s rarely the product of a clear vision first. Instead, it comes when you start playing.</p>
<p>I quit my job to focus on programming. Although I&#39;m only a few weeks into Recurse Center, I&#39;ve already started to feel some of that pressure to make good things. I&#39;m going to try my best to heed this advice and, instead, focusing on making a lot of things.</p>
