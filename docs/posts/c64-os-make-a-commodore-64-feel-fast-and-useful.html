							C64OS.com has grown from its original purpose as an outlet for me to blog about
							my adventures in learning to code in 6502 and my progress towards the development of
							a simple, single–tasking, event–driven operating system. It is growing into a resource
							for new and returning users of the Commodore 64 and 128 to find out about all the 
							great new things being developed both in hardware and software.

								In the weblog, you&#39;ll find posts that cover news, editorial reviews, programming
								reference documents, technical deep dives into software and hardware, plus thoughts
								and progress updates on the development of C64 OS.
							</p>
							<p>
								Over time my posts have gotten longer and more detailed. These in–depth posts take 
								time research, write and edit. I have been keeping to steady pace of at least one 
								such post a month. It is difficult to get regular readers if new content is not 
								showing up more frequently. To help cope with this, the weblog also has an RSS 
								feed. Subscribe to it, and you&#39;ll get new posts in your feed reader as soon as 
								they&#39;re published. Or <a href="https://twitter.com/gregnacu">follow me on 
								Twitter</a>, where I announce each new post.

							<h2>COMMODORE 8 BIT BUYER&#39;S GUIDE</h2>
							<p><a href="http://c64os.com/buyersguide/"><img src="http://c64os.com/resources/section-buyersguide.png"/></a>
							</p>
							<p>
								Commodore hardware is great. The architecture has proven to be very well designed
								as is still usable and expandable decades later. But in order to take advantage
								of that architecture design, you need to actually expand it by building or 
								purchasing expansion hardware.
							</p>
							<p>
								Commodore 8-bit computers have had lots of third–party supporting hardware. And 
								while much of it is no longer commercially available, there are hundreds of modern 
								projects and expansion options that are available and under development today. 
								When I returned from my hiatus, I was amazed by the rich support the C64 still has, 
								from hardware, software and publications. However, I learned about these things 
								in dribs and drabs by haunting IRC channels, message boards and following C64 fans 
								on Twitter.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Commodore 8 Bit Buyer&#39;s Guide is a graphical catalog of all the hardware 
								products, projects and kits I know of that are commercially available today. 
								Product feature pages show high–res photos, link to the homepage, documentation 
								and supporting software, include a mini review and product description and list 
								prices and instructions on how you can buy the product for yourself.

							<h2>C64 OS GUIDES AND DOCUMENTATION</h2>
							<p><a href="http://c64os.com/c64os/"><img src="http://c64os.com/resources/section-c64os.png"/></a>
							</p>
							<p>
								The site is named for this main and overarching project, C64 OS, which I began 
								developing in the fall of 2016. Its goal is to be simple and streamlined and to
								work with the hardware limitations. I want to make an authentic C64 OS, rather than 
								trying to ape the behavior of other OS platforms. C64 OS exists to provide 
								consistency and usability advantages for the user, and a more modern development 
								platform for the programmer.

							<h3>Features</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Event–driven interaction model</li>
								<li>Advanced mouse and keyboard event system</li>
								<li>Hybrid memory manager</li>
								<li>String, Math and File Libraries</li>
								<li>Text screen compositor</li>

							<h2>C64 LUGGABLE PROJECT</h2>
							<p><a href="http://c64os.com/c64luggable/"><img src="http://c64os.com/resources/section-c64lug.png"/></a>
							</p>
							<p>
								In 2000 I acquired my first SX-64 Executive Computer. A luggable C64 with a 
								built in 5&#34; display, 1541 floppy drive and a unified power supply. All with a 
								handle on the top. I heavily modified mine to include a SuperCPU, IDE64, CD-Rom
								drive, Ethernet adapter and High Speed RS232, all powered by a lightweight AT Power
								Supply.
							</p>
							<p>
								But the SX-64 was built for a different time. Its display is a massive CRT block, 
								1–foot deep. The rest of the internal layout is modeled around this main feature. 
								C64 Luggable is a project to build an all–in–one C64, oriented vertically rather 
								than horizontally. It has a large 15&#34; LCD display and foregoes old tech like a 
								floppy drive, in favor of SD card and USB–based storage. Ethernet is a standard. 
								And so are its front–mounted 4–player controller inputs, and rear–mounted PS/2 
								mouse and keyboard ports.
							</p>
							<p>
								I love my Commodore computers and how expandable they are, but they have a tendency
								to take up a whole desk with sprawling peripherals and multiple power supplies. 
								This is fun its own way, but it makes them inconvenient to take with you. C64 
								Luggable is a practical project for me, and a reference design for other people to 
								be creatively inspired. It allows me to bring a C64 with me to my friends&#39; houses, 
								to remove the friction of getting them to be able to enjoy C64 demos and 
								multi–player games with me. C64 Luggable helps me share the love of the C64 more
								easily and with more people.

							<h4>Dear Commodore 64 enthusiast,</h4>

							<p>
								I&#39;m working hard on C64 OS, and I&#39;m building it for you and for the Commodore 
								community. Its combination of a zippy and consistent user interface, essential 
								programming frameworks, and a suite of online proxy services, will give you a new 
								way to enjoy your Commodore 64.
							</p>
							<p>
								The C64OS.com weblog brings you quality reading material, programming and hardware
								reference, technical deep dives, product and event reviews, and updates on my 
								progress.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Buyer&#39;s Guide is the best way for you to find out about new and existing, 
								commercially available, products, projects and kits for all Commodore 8-Bit 
								computers. With large clear photos, detailed writeups, and standardized information
								on price and compatibility, links to documentation, third–party reviews, and 
								specific instructions on how to buy, the Buyer&#39;s Guide is becoming the resource 
								of choice for discovering what you want to get next and how to get it.
							</p>
							<p>
								But, you guessed it. Providing you with all of this great content takes time, 
								effort and money. The good news is that you can help out! You can make a real
								difference, and support the future of these great initiatives with a helpful 
								contribution.
							</p>
							<p>
								The easiest way to support my work is to purchase one of the items I am offering.
								I am currently selling beautiful, high quality, Commodore logo patches. These 
								are available now in the <em><a href="http://c64os.com/buyersguide/#support">Help Support Me</a></em> 
								section of the Commodore 8–Bit Buyer&#39;s Guide. You&#39;ll get a cool logo patch and 
								I&#39;ll get a bit of funding to help offset the costs. If you don&#39;t want one of the
								products I&#39;m offering through the site, you can always make a donation, just buy 
								me a cup of coffee. (And, I&#39;m now accepting Bitcoin.)
							</p>
							<h4>Thank you so much, for your generous support</h4>
