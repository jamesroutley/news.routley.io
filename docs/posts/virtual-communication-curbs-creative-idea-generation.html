This unprecedented shift to full-time remote employment demonstrated the viability of virtual work at a large scale, further legitimizing the growing work-from-home movement of the last decade. In a 2021 survey, 75% of US employees reported a personal preference for working from home at least one day a week, and 40% of employees indicated they would quit a job that required full-time in-person work<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Barrero, J.

From the Greek symposium to Lennon and McCartney, collaborations have provided some of the most important ideas in human history. Until recently, these collaborations have largely required the same physical space because the existing communication technologies (such as letters, email and phone calls) limited the extent of information that is available to communicators and reduced the synchronicity of information exchange (media richness theory, social presence theory, media synchronicity theory<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Daft, R.

However, recent advances in network quality and display resolution have ushered in a synchronous, audio-visual technology—videoconferencing—that conveys many of the same aural and non-verbal information cues as face-to-face interaction. If videoconferencing eventually closes the information gap between virtual and in-person interaction, the question arises whether this new technology could effectively replace in-person collaborative idea generation.</p><p>Here we show that, even if video interaction could communicate the same information, there remains an inherent and overlooked physical difference in communicating through video that is not psychologically benign: in-person teams operate in a fully shared physical space, whereas virtual teams inhabit a virtual space that is bounded by the screen in front of each member. Our data suggest that this physical difference in shared space compels virtual communicators to narrow their visual field by concentrating on the screen and filtering out peripheral visual stimuli that are not visible or relevant to their partner.

Yet the narrowed cognitive focus induced by the use of screens in virtual interaction does not hinder all collaborative activities. Specifically, idea generation is typically followed by selecting which idea to pursue, which requires cognitive focus and analytical reasoning<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Simon, H.

The number of words spoken did not significantly differ by modality, but virtual groups engaged in significantly fewer speaker switches compared with in-person groups and significantly less crosstalk.

We examined whether interaction modality alters any of these processes during idea generation and whether controlling for these processes meaningfully attenuated our documented negative effect of virtual collaboration on ideation (see <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://martin.kleppmann.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#MOESM1">Supplementary Information J</a> for a relevant literature and details of the methods and analyses).

However, when determining whether or not to use virtual teams, many additional factors necessarily enter the calculus, such as the cost of commute and real estate, the potential to expand the talent pool, the value of serendipitous encounters<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 36" title="Hinds, P.

Although some of these factors are intangible and more difficult to quantify, there are concrete and immediate economic advantages to virtual interaction (such as a reduced need for physical space, reduced salary for employees in areas with a lower cost of living and reduced business travel expenses). To capture the best of both worlds, many workplaces are planning to or currently combine in-person and virtual interaction. Indeed, a 2021 survey suggests that American employees will work from home around 20% of the time after the pandemic<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Barrero, J.

Our results indicate that, in these hybrid setups, it might make sense to prioritize creative idea generation during in-person meetings. However, it is important to caution that our results document only the cognitive cost of virtual interaction.

Here, we explore whether the negative effect of virtual interaction on idea generation generalizes to more established and/or larger teams. To investigate this, we first examined the relevance to established teams by testing whether familiarity moderated the effect of modality on ideation in our field data.

Putting our findings together with previous findings, research suggests that in-person pairs outperform larger in-person groups and virtual pairs, and virtual pairs outperform larger virtual groups. Thus, our substantive recommendation is, cost permitting, to generate ideas in pairs and in person.</p><p>In our laboratory study, we used 15.6-inch MacBook Pro retina display laptops because, at the time of data collection (2016 to 2021), laptops were the most common hardware used in videoconferencing, and 15.6 inch was the most prevalent screen size offered in the market (<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://martin.kleppmann.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#MOESM1">Supplementary Information N</a>). We examined whether our effect would generalize to larger screen sizes in the online study described above. Specifically, we leveraged participants’ natural variance in screen size to investigate the role of screen size in virtual idea generation. We found no evidence that screen size is associated with idea generation performance in virtual pairs (even when controlling for income, comfort with videoconferencing and time spent on the computer; <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://martin.kleppmann.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#MOESM1">Supplementary Information M</a>).

Although it is reassuring that we demonstrate our effects with two different participant pools that vary in their creativity training, task type and domain expertise, our contexts are representative of only a subset of innovation teams.

Where possible, we combined the data from the two batches to increase statistical power. When the two batches of data were combined, our power to detect a difference in conditions at our effect size was 89%. Below, we outline the methods for each stimulus batch.</p><h3 id="Sec13">Stimulus 1: frisbee</h3><h4 id="Sec14">Procedure</h4><p>Three hundred participants (202 female, 95 male, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 26.1; s.d.<sub>age</sub> = 8.61; three participants did not complete the survey and are therefore missing demographic information) from a university student and staff pool in the United States participated in the study in exchange for US$10. We posted timeslots in an online research portal that allowed each participant to enroll anonymously into a pair. The participants provided consent before beginning the study. This study was approved by the Stanford University Human Subjects Ethics Board (protocol 35916). The laboratory study was conducted by university research assistants blinded to the hypothesis who were not present during the group interaction.</p><p>On arrival, the pairs were informed that their first task was to generate creative alternative uses for a Frisbee and that their second task was to select their most creative idea. These tasks were incentive-aligned: each creative idea that was generated (as scored by outside judges) earned the pair one raffle ticket for a US$200 raffle, and selecting a creative idea earned the pair five additional raffle tickets. Half of the teams (<i>n</i> = 75) learned that they would be working together on the task in the same room, whereas the other half (<i>n</i> = 75) were told that they would be working in separate rooms and communicating using video technology (WebEx, v.36.6–36.9). Groups were assigned in an alternating order, such that the first group was in-person, the second group was virtual and so on. This ensured an equal and unbiased recruitment of each condition.</p><p>Before being moved to the task room(s), one participant was randomly selected to be the typist (that is, to record the ideas during the idea-generation stage and indicate the selected idea in the idea-selection stage for the pair) by drawing a piece of paper from a mug. In both communication modalities, each team member had an iPad with a blank Google sheet open (accessed in 2016). The typist had a wireless keyboard and editing capabilities, whereas the other team member could only view the ideas on their iPad. Thus, only the typist could record the generated ideas and select the pair’s top idea, but both members had equal information about the team’s performance (that is, the generated ideas and the selected idea). In-person pairs sat at a table across from each other. Virtual pairs sat at identical tables in separate rooms with their partner displayed on video across from them. The video display was a full-screen video stream of only their partner (the video of the self was not displayed) on a 15-inch retina-display MacBook Pro.</p><p>Each pair generated ideas for 5 min and spent 1 min selecting their most creative idea. They indicated their top creative idea by putting an asterisk next to the idea on the Google sheet. Nine groups did not indicate their top idea on the Google sheet; in the second batch of data collection, we used an online survey that required a response to prevent this issue. Finally, as an exploratory measure, each pair was given 5 min to evaluate each of their ideas on a seven-point scale (1 (least creative) to 7 (most creative)).</p><p>Once pairs completed both the idea-generation and the idea-selection task, each team member individually completed a survey on Qualtrics (accessed in 2016) in a separate room.</p><h3 id="Sec15">Stimulus 2: bubble wrap</h3><h4 id="Sec16">Procedure</h4><p>Participants (334) from a university student and staff pool in the United States participated in the study in exchange for US$15. We also recruited 18 participants from Craigslist in an effort to accelerate data collection. However, the students reported feeling uncomfortable, and idea generation performance dropped substantially with student–craigslist pairs, so we removed these pairs from the analysis. Our final participant list did not overlap with participants in the first batch of data collection in the laboratory. The participants provided consent before beginning the study. This study was approved by the Stanford University Human Subjects Ethics Board (protocol 35916). The laboratory study was conducted by university research assistants blinded to the hypothesis who were not present during the group interaction.</p><p>We a priori excluded any pairs who experienced technical difficulties (such as screen share issues, audio feedback or dropped video calls) and aimed to collect 150 pairs in total. Our final sample consisted of 302 participants (177 females, 119 males, 2 non-binary, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 23.5, s.d.<sub>age</sub> = 7.09; we are missing demographic and survey data from four of the participants). Mimicking the design of the first batch of data collection in the laboratory, pairs generated uses for bubble wrap for 5 min and then spent 1 min selecting their most creative idea. As before, half of the teams learned that they would be working together on the task in the same room (<i>n</i> = 74), whereas the other half (<i>n</i> = 77) were told that they would be working in separate (but identical) rooms and communicating using video technology (Zoom v.3.2). The groups were assigned in an alternating order, such that the first group was in-person, the second group was virtual and so on. This ensured an equal and unbiased recruitment of each condition. Again, one partner was randomly assigned to be the typist. The tasks were incentivized using the same structure as the first batch of collection.</p><p>For in-person pairs, each participant had a 15-inch task computer directly in front of them with their partner across from them and situated to their right. For virtual pairs, each participant had two 15-inch computers: a task computer directly in front of them and computer displaying their partner’s face to their right (again, self-view was hidden). This set-up enabled us to unobtrusively measure gaze by using the task computer to record each participant’s face during the interaction: in both conditions, the task was directly in front of each participant and the partner was to each participant’s right.</p><p>In contrast to the first batch of data collection, we used Qualtrics (accessed in 2018) to collect task data. Pairs first generated alternative uses for bubble wrap. After 5 min, the page automatically advanced. We next asked each pair to select their most creative idea and defined a creative idea as both novel (that is, different from the normal uses of bubble wrap) and functional (that is, useful and easy to implement). The pair had exactly 1 min to select their most creative idea. After 1 min, the page automatically advanced. If the pair still had not selected their top idea, the survey returned the selection page and marked that the team went over time. Virtual and in-person pairs did not significantly differ in the percentage of teams that went over time (that is, took longer than a minute); 17.6% of in-person pairs and 16.9% of virtual pairs went over time (Pearson’s <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 0.001, <i>P</i> = 0.926). Finally, as exploratory measures, each pair (1) selected an idea from another idea set and then (2) evaluated how novel and functional their selected idea was on a seven-point scale.</p><p>Importantly, in both conditions, the task rooms were populated with ten props: five expected props (that is, props consistent with a behavioural laboratory schema (a filing cabinet, folders, a cardboard box, a speaker and a pencil box)) and five unexpected props (a skeleton poster, a large house plant, a bowl of lemons, blue dishes and yoga ball boxes; Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://martin.kleppmann.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#Fig3">1</a>, inspired by ref. <sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 39" title="Brewer, W.

From there, we had at least two independent coders (blinded to the hypothesis and condition) look at video frames of eye gaze angles extracted from the software and indicate the idiosyncratic threshold at which each participant’s eye gaze shifted horizontally (from left to centre, and centre to right, <i>α</i> = 0.98) and vertically (up to centre, and centre to down, <i>α</i> = 0.85). Out of 302 participants, 275 videos of participants yielded usable gaze data. Nine videos were not saved, six videos cut off participants’ eyes, four videos were too dark to reliably code, two videos were corrupted and could not load, two videos contained participants with glasses that resulted in eye gaze misclassification, two videos (one team) did not have their partner to their right and two videos were misclassified by OpenFace.</p><p>Using these thresholds, we calculated how often each participant looked at their partner, the task and the surrounding room. To repeat, the recording came from the task computer, and the partner was always situated to the participant’s right (or from the perspective of a person viewing the video, to the left). As human coders marked the thresholds (blind to the hypothesis and condition), we report the categorizations from the perspective of an observer of the video. Specifically, looking either (1) horizontally to the left and vertically centre or (2) horizontally to the left and vertically down was categorized as ‘partner gaze’; looking either (1) horizontally centre and vertically centre or (2) horizontally centre and vertically down was categorized as ‘task gaze’; and the remaining area was categorized as ‘room gaze’, which encompassed looking (1) horizontally left and vertically upward, (2) horizontally centre and vertically upward, (3) horizontally right and vertically upward, (4) horizontally right and vertically centre, and (5) horizontally right and vertically down (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://martin.kleppmann.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#Fig2">2</a>; consent was obtained to use these images for publication). We chose this unobtrusive methodology instead of more cumbersome eye-tracking hardware to maintain organic interactions—wearing strange headgear could make participants consciously aware of their eye gaze or change the natural dynamic of conversation.</p><p>We excluded six videos that were less than 290 s long. The effects do not change in significance when these videos are included in the analyses. With these excluded videos, as before, virtual groups spent significantly more time looking at their partner (<i>M</i><sub>virtual</sub> = 90.6 s, s.d. = 58.3, <i>M</i><sub>in-person</sub> = 52.6 s, s.d. = 54.3, linear mixed-effect regression, <i>n</i> = 276 participants, <i>b</i> = 38.00, s.e. = 6.95, <i>t</i><sub>139</sub> = 5.46, <i>P </i>&lt; 0.001, Cohen’s <i>d</i> = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.43–0.92) and spent significantly less time looking at the surrounding room (<i>M</i><sub>virtual</sub> = 32.4 s, s.d. = 34.6, <i>M</i><sub>in-person</sub> = 60.9 s, s.d. = 43.7, linear mixed-effect regression, <i>n</i> = 276 participants, <i>b</i> = 28.44, s.e. = 4.96, <i>t</i><sub>145</sub> = 5.74, <i>P </i>&lt; 0.001, Cohen’s <i>d</i> = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.48–0.98; Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://martin.kleppmann.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#Fig2">2</a>). There was again no evidence that time spent looking at the task differed by modality (<i>M</i><sub>virtual</sub> = 176 s, s.d. = 63.6, <i>M</i><sub>in-person</sub> = 184 s, s.d. = 63.0, linear mixed-effect regression, <i>n</i> = 276 participants, <i>b</i> = 7.39, s.e. = 7.63, <i>t</i><sub>274</sub> = 0.97, <i>P </i>= 0.334, Cohen’s <i>d</i> = 0.12, 95% CI = −0.12–0.35). Importantly, gaze around the room was significantly associated with an increased number of creative ideas (negative binomial regression, <i>n</i> = 146 pairs, <i>b</i> = 0.003, s.e. = 0.001, <i>z</i> = 3.10, <i>P </i>= 0.002). Furthermore, gaze around the room mediated the effect of modality on idea generation (5,000 nonparametric bootstraps, 95% CI = 0.05 to 1.15).</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Field experiment"><div id="Sec23-section"><h2 id="Sec23">Field experiment</h2><div id="Sec23-content"><h3 id="Sec24">Procedure</h3><p>Engineer teams (837) participated in an ideation workshop under the aegis of an ‘intrapreneurship’ program. The workshop was conducted by the employer at company offices in Finland, Hungary, India, Israel and Portugal as part of a voluntary workshop during work hours. The employer shared non-identifiable secondary data from the workshop with us and, as a result, the Stanford Human Subjects Committee deemed that no IRB or consent was required. The company gave us permission to publish the results from our analysis, contingent on their intellectual property from the workshops (the generated ideas) remaining confidential. At each site, typically two sessions were run each day, for a total of 26 sessions across sites, and each session was made up of an organizational team (average session size, 32 teams; range of session size, 8 teams to 56 teams). Research assistants (who were not blinded to the hypothesis) ran the workshop and were present during group interaction to answer any questions and fix technical problems.</p><p>In the workshop, engineers were first given a 60 min introduction to the intrapreneurship program. In Hungary, for the first six sessions, there was an additional 60 min lecture about creativity and idea selection before the workshop. After observing fatigue, the order was switched for the remaining two sessions. Engineers then learned that the workshop involved (1) generating new product ideas for the company and then (2) selecting and developing one idea to submit to the intrapreneurship program. Engineers were instructed that the ideas should not be limited to current products offered by the company and to consider ideas that could become products two years from now.</p><p>The engineers were randomly assigned into pairs, with one engineer randomly assigned as the typist, and the pairs were randomly assigned into condition (in-person versus virtual). The in-person and virtual conditions were split into two different rooms and then issued the manipulation. Pairs in the virtual condition (<i>n</i> = 434) learned that, because they worked at a global company, the company was testing different collaboration tools and the engineers would therefore be doing this workshop virtually over Webex (a communication technology almost all the engineers were familiar with and often used to collaborate with their remote teams). The following Webex versions were used in each workshop: Portugal, 38.3; Finland and Israel, 38.6; Hungary, 39.3; India, 40.1. The typists remained in one room and their partners were brought to another room. All of the pairs established their video connection before the timed idea generation session began. Pairs in the in-person condition (<i>n</i> = 403) were instructed to space out and find a place in the room to sit together before beginning the idea generation task.</p><p>In Finland, Israel and Portugal, the pairs had 1 h to generate ideas. In Hungary and India, the pairs had 45 min to generate ideas to allow for time at the end to peer-evaluate each other’s ideas. After idea generation, the pairs selected one of their ideas to further develop and submit to the intrapreneurship program. In Finland, Israel and Portugal, the firm used a third-party platform for idea collection that didn’t allow for idea rating (Innostreams, beta release, v.0.8). However, in Hungary and India, the employer designed a workshop platform on Qualtrics (accessed in 2019 and 2020) and implemented a peer-evaluation system at the end of each workshop session. Specifically, each engineer was assigned 8 to 12 ideas from other pairs in the idea generation session. Furthermore, to increase power, the company also sent out a Qualtrics survey (accessed in 2021 and 2022) to their engineers to score the ideas collected in Finland. Following the same procedure as in the workshop, engineers were randomly assigned ten ideas to score. Given low participation rates, the employer allowed engineers to submit up to three scores. We analysed the first three submissions from each engineer. A small subset of engineers participated more than ten times (<i>n</i> = 6) and were excluded from analyses. Participation was voluntary, and each submission won a raffle ticket into a raffle for an iPad.</p><p>To score the ideas, the engineers individually rated each idea on four dimensions identified by the intrapreneurship program: (1) this idea identifies a real pain point that is significant to customers; (2) the idea is potentially disruptive and game changing; (3) this idea has a unique value proposition; and (4) the solution is realistic. Idea scores were calculated by averaging these four dimensions for each idea. To capture idea selection, we calculated a ‘decision error score’ by subtracting the score of the highest-rated idea from the score of the selected idea.</p><h3 id="Sec25">Exclusions</h3><p>One site in Poland was predetermined to be excluded. Unlike the others, this workshop was conducted by the company outside of company offices, in a hotel meeting space. Perhaps for this reason, participants exhibited rampant non-compliance, including a notable preoccupation with the hotel catering’s coffee and cookie station. The non-compliance was exacerbated in the in-person condition, as many engineers brought coffee and snacks back to their workspace and socialized with other teams; the headsets in the virtual condition prohibited the same extent of socialization. Importantly, the results do not change in significance if we include this sixth site (<i>M</i><sub>virtual</sub> = 7.38, s.d. = 5.18, <i>M</i><sub>in-person</sub> = 8.15, s.d. = 5.78, negative binomial mixed-effect regression, <i>n</i> = 904 pairs, <i>b</i> = 0.09, s.e. = 0.04, <i>z</i> = 2.24, <i>P </i>= 0.025, Cohen’s <i>d</i> = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.01–0.27).</p><p>Across the remaining sites, we a priori dropped 32 pairs due to technical difficulties, 21 pairs due to non-compliance and 18 teams because they arrived late or left early. We also excluded 5 teams who had participated previously and 15 three-person teams (when the session size contained an odd number of people). Thus, out of 837 teams, 745 pairs (1,490 engineers) constituted our final sample. 365 pairs were assigned to interact in person, and 380 groups were assigned to interact virtually. There are slightly more virtual groups because, after a few workshops, the company began to over-assign Webex groups by creating more odd labels than even labels to pass out to compensate for a few Webex groups each session being dropped due to technical difficulties.</p><p>Furthermore, for idea selection, we a priori dropped teams that reselected their idea (that is, selected an idea, worked on it and then changed their mind, <i>n</i> = 14 pairs), and we are missing data from groups that did not select their idea (<i>n</i> = 1 pair), did not submit their ideas in time to get scored (<i>n</i> = 3 pairs), and teams whose ideas were not scored due to attrition during the idea evaluation survey (<i>n</i> = 13 pairs). Thus, out of 619 pairs in the final two sites, 305 in-person pairs and 317 virtual pairs constituted our final sample for idea selection. The results do not differ in significance if we include all of the excluded teams (idea generation: <i>M</i><sub>virtual</sub> = 7.44, s.d. = 5.51, <i>M</i><sub>in-person</sub> = 8.33, s.d. = 5.99, negative binomial mixed-effect regression, <i>n</i> = 822 pairs, <i>b</i> = 0.11, s.e. = 0.05, <i>z</i> = 2.52, <i>P </i>= 0.012, Cohen’s <i>d</i> = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.02–0.29; idea selection: <i>M</i><sub>virtual</sub> = 0.79, s.d. = 0.76, <i>M</i><sub>in-person</sub> = 0.92, s.d. = 0.84, Kruskal–Wallis rank sum, <i>n</i> = 656 pairs, <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 5.46, <i>P </i>= 0.019, Cohen’s <i>d</i> = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.05–0.36). Note that we still excluded three-person teams because they deviate from our context.</p><p>Researchers conducting the analyses were not blinded to the hypothesis and all data were analysed using R (v.4.0.1).</p><h3 id="Sec26">Reporting summary</h3><p>Further information on research design is available in the <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://martin.kleppmann.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#MOESM2">Nature Research Reporting Summary</a> linked to this paper.</p></div></div></section>
