    <h1>Most users cannot identify AI bias, even in training data</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div id="text-content-container"><p>UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — When recognizing faces and emotions, artificial intelligence (AI) can be biased, like classifying white people as happier than people from other racial backgrounds. This happens because the data used to train the AI contained a disproportionate number of happy white faces, leading it to correlate race with emotional expression. In a recent study, published in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15213269.2025.2558036">Media Psychology</a>, researchers asked users to assess such skewed training data, but most users didn’t notice the bias — unless they were in the negatively portrayed group.</p>
<p>The study was designed to examine whether laypersons understand that unrepresentative data used to train AI systems can result in biased performance. The scholars, who have been studying this issue for five years, said AI systems should be trained so they “work for everyone,” and produce outcomes that are diverse and representative for all groups, not just one majority group. According to the researchers, that includes understanding what AI is learning from unanticipated correlations in the training data — or the datasets fed into the system to teach it how it is expected to perform in the future.</p>
<p>“In the case of this study, AI seems to have learned that race is an important criterion for determining whether a face is happy or sad,” said senior author <a href="https://www.bellisario.psu.edu/people/individual/s.-shyam-sundar">S. Shyam Sundar</a>, Evan Pugh University Professor and director of the <a href="https://csrai.psu.edu/">Center for Socially Responsible Artificial Intelligence</a> at Penn State. “Even though we don&#39;t mean for it to learn that.”</p>
<p>The question is whether humans can recognize this bias in the training data. According to the researchers, most participants in their experiments only started to notice bias when the AI showed biased performance, such as misclassifying emotions for Black individuals but doing a good job of classifying the emotions expressed by white individuals. Black participants were more likely to suspect that there was an issue, especially when the training data over-represented their own group for representing negative emotion (sadness).</p>
<p>“In one of the experiment scenarios — which featured racially biased AI performance — the system failed to accurately classify the facial expression of the images from minority groups,” said lead author Cheng &#34;Chris&#34; Chen, an assistant professor of emerging media and technology at Oregon State University who earned her doctorate in mass communications from the Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications at Penn State. “That is what we mean by biased performance in an AI system where the system favors the dominant group in its classification.”</p>
<p>Chen, Sundar and co-author Eunchae Jang, a doctoral student in mass communications at the Bellisario College, created 12 versions of a prototype AI system designed to detect users’ facial expressions. With 769 participants across three experiments, the researchers tested how users might detect bias in different scenarios. The first two experiments included participants from a variety of racial backgrounds with white participants making up most of the sample. In the third experiment, the researchers intentionally recruited an equal number of Black and white participants.</p>
