      <p>A book scanner is any device used to digitize the pages of a book. Every book scanner has three parts. Cameras are used to capture images of each page. A controller triggers the cameras and saves the resulting photographs somewhere convenient. The scanner rig provides an ideal photographic environment while holding everything together.</p>

      <p>Book scanners can be as simple as a cardboard box rig, a camera on a tripod, and your hand as the controller. Or they can have multiple moving parts with computer-controlled capture and high resolution cameras. Here is how a typical scanning rig comes together:</p>

	    <li>
	      <div>
		<p><h2>Lighting</h2></p>
		<p>Though some scanners rely on ambient room lighting, dedicated lighting is important to capture good scans. You want the lights to be strong and even. The lights must also be positioned to minimize glare and reflections.</p>
	      </div>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <div>
		<p><h2>Cameras</h2></p>
		<p>Each camera must be mounted securely and aligned to point directly at the center of the page it is scanning. If possible, you want two cameras so you can capture both pages at the same time.</p>
	      </div>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <div>
		<p><h2>Platen</h2></p>
		<p>The easiest way to avoid page curl in your images is to flatten the pages by pressing them against glass or acrylic. While there are some computer algorithms that can help dewarp the pages after capture, it is always more reliable to just capture flat pages in the first place.</p>
	      </div>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <div>
		<p><h2>Book</h2></p>
		<p>The book lies at the center of any scanning rig. It is alternately pressed against the platen for scanning and then pulled away so that the page can be flipped.</p>
	      </div>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <div>
		<p><h2>Cradle</h2></p>
		<p>The cradle supports the back and spine of the book. While any contact with a book will cause wear and tear, a V-shaped cradle can minimize the wear that scanning can cause.</p>
