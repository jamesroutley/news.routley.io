    <h1>Show HN: Midnight Reminders via Morse Code</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">It&#39;s 2 AM, and I just had an idea, or something I need to remember. I don&#39;t want to disturb my wife by getting up, and even the very-dim light from my phone can be bothersome. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyctography" rel="nofollow">Writing is difficult</a>. What&#39;s the answer? Morse code, of course!</p>
<p dir="auto">I built a device using a $6 <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5526" rel="nofollow">Raspberry Pi Pico W</a> and a silent handheld switch. The switch is connected to a GPIO pin. On powerup, it connects to wifi, and immediately starts listening for morse code. Once a morse code sequence is received and has been silent for 10 seconds, it POSTs the text to a web service, which then emails it to me.</p>
