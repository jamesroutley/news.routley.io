<p>I didn’t think this was possible:</p>
<p>This App Store app [My Metronome - Tempo Keeper] immediately asks you for money and then <em>disables</em> the “Quit” option so that you can never close it!</p>
<p>And it’s been like that on the App Store for years!</p>

<p>The developer has grossed almost a million dollars on the App Store.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.imore.com/mac-app-store-developers-abusing-bait-and-switch-app-purchases"><p>Users say the app forces users to pay by locking a user’s computer, with some unable to close ads or the program itself until they had paid for the service, almost akin to ransomware.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1513970950554984453">Jeff Johnson</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1513970950554984453"><p>This developer “Music Paradise, LLC” appears to be the exact same developer as “Groove Vibes”. Registered at the  same street address in Novosibirsk, Russia!</p><p>Also, both apps lock up your Mac and can’t be quit, which is what led me to investigate.</p></blockquote>

<p>But they are catching some good developers. <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting/status/1514331013631164429">Jacob Eiting</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/jeiting/status/1514331013631164429"><p>One of our employees apps just got banned from the App Store for “trying to deceive users” because we used it to test price change behavior: they created a new SKU, subscribed to it, then raised the price from $4/wk to $9/wk to get screenshots of the flow.</p><p>This must have flagged something in the App Store looking for fraudulent price increases (even though it was opt-in) and they got a notice that the app will be removed in 14 days.</p><p>They told Apple it was just a test, and that wasn’t a good enough reason for them.</p><p>It was ONE PURCHASE. That’s obviously not fraud.</p></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, Disney gets a special flow for increasing the subscription price without the customer opting in.</p>
