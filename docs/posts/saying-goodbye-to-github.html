    <h1>Saying Goodbye to GitHub</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><small> Published: [ <b><time datetime="2023-04-02T20:00:00-04:00">2023-04-02 20:00</time></b> ] </small></p><p>I&#39;ve been using GitHub since I was eleven years old. To be fair, I didn&#39;t really <em>understand</em> git at the time, but I was able to fumble my way through it (barely). I do remember getting banned because eleven year old me decided to tell the internet my age on GitHub, and the ToS prohibited me from using the service until I was at least thirteen.</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>GitHub and I have had some nice times together. And I think it&#39;s time for me to say goodbye.</p><p>Way back when, young little Ersei was learning Python. I made a little program that extracts the Exif geolocation data from pictures and puts them on a map. The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/9p4/code-stuff/tree/master/Projects/Apps/PicFinder/Python_PicFinder">here</a>. I needed a way to distribute that app, and I don&#39;t remember how but I found GitHub.</p><p>My memory is a little fuzzy, so bear with me.</p><p>I remember uploading the <code>.exe</code> for the Windows-only <a href="https://pyinstaller.org">PyInstaller</a> app to the GitHub releases of the original <a href="https://github.com/9p4/PicFinder">repository</a>. I remember going through that first &#34;create your repository&#34; setup for the first time. I can just <em>upload</em> what I&#39;ve made and the whole world can use it!</p><p>Every time I found a repo there that I enjoyed, I gave it a star. Every time someone liked one of my repos, they give it a star. There was discovery of new programs, libraries, things I would&#39;ve never found without GitHub. There was magic in that discovery, that starry-eyed time where I could explore and learn and <em>grow</em>.</p><p>I feel like GitHub has lost that magic.</p><p>Before, what felt like an interesting and <em>independent</em> website, has gone to shit. Yes, the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github">Microsoft acquisition</a> changed things, but I was willing to give things a shot. Hopefully, not much will change, right?</p><p>And not much did. Everything kept chugging on. I don&#39;t remember any grievances. Everything kept going. I remember the GitHub dashboard changing from whatever it was then to whatever it was now. I remember being mad at that, then getting used to it.</p><p>And something has happened that I don&#39;t think I can overlook. GitHub started <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">training AI</a> on code hosted on their website. I looked at it with the same glee as I did with every other discovery on GitHub. I didn&#39;t understand what it meant at the time (how far I&#39;ve come in two years, I guess). Then I started reading reports of Copilot regurgitating GPL code. I really didn&#39;t understand how these AI tools worked at the time. I thought it was more human. That it was learning.</p><p>Lies. All of it. It&#39;s a stochastic parrot. No learning is going on. It&#39;s guessing based off the billions of parameters it has ingested.</p><p>All those years ago, when I started using GitHub, I found a love for open source. I became (and still am) a believer in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft movement</a>. It let me learn, to gain the skills I have now. It let me grow to who I am today. I felt righteous anger at news of GPL violations by soulless corporations stealing the hard work of independent programmers and assimilating it into their own proprietary software. I was distraught over the open-source community being <em>exploited</em>. That there was nothing being given back.</p><p><em>On June 21, 2022, GitHub Copilot is now a subscription service for $10 a month, or $100 a year (for individuals).</em></p><p><em>On March 22, 2023, GitHub releases <a href="https://github.com/features/preview/copilot-x">Copilot X</a> based on the new GPT-4 models by OpenAI.</em></p><p>For just $10 a month or $100 a year, you too can get programming help with no obligation to give back to anyone!</p><p>I love open-source. And I love giving back. Using GitHub does not align with that goal. The code that was regurgitated by the model is marketed as &#34;AI generated&#34; and available for use for any project you want. Including proprietary ones. It&#39;s <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2022/06/23/Copilot-GPL-washing.html">laundering</a> open-source code. All of the decades of knowledge and uncountable hours of work is being, well, stolen. There is nothing being given back.</p><p>It&#39;s not an equal exchange. I can&#39;t, in good consciousness, support GitHub. I can&#39;t betray the community that sparked and grew my interest in software. I can&#39;t betray those millions of people whose shoulder I am standing on. I can&#39;t betray what I believe inâ€”giving back.</p><p>So I&#39;ve left GitHub. It was nice while it lasted.</p><hr/><p>Q: So why switch now, if these issues have been going on for years?</p><p>A: Well, there just aren&#39;t many places I can go. I could go to GitLab, but they have their own fair share of issues and a disgusting UI/UX. Codeberg was nice too, and was very GitHub-like so the transition would be easier. But I wanted something that would last and be reliable. Something that aligned with my philosophy of open-source. As I was on a student discount spree as of late (including GitHub Pro, yes), I decided to go with <a href="https://sourcehut.org">SourceHut</a>. I&#39;m going to try it out, and see how it goes. So far, it&#39;s a wonderful experience.</p><p>Q: But Ersei, you still have a GitHub account! Why?</p><p>A: I can&#39;t quite delete my account since there are still contributions I wish to make to other projects. I won&#39;t let my personal philosophy restrict my contributions based on where they are hosted. I also have a large project that will be infeasible to move over, due to user contributions and general lock-in. Ah yes, the lock-in. I&#39;ve been using GitHub for so long that I&#39;ve been completely absorbed into their platform. Pull requests, issues, GitHub Actions, etcetera etcetera. It&#39;s hard to move, and this is by design. Remember, GitHub is a for-profit company run by Microsoft.</p><p>Q: What about the social features of GitHub? I enjoy the discovery and star features. There just isn&#39;t any community like it. Where can I get that?</p><p>A: The TL;DR is that you can&#39;t. A large social network (and that is what GitHub is) is large because everyone joined it, and everyone is making content for it. There really can&#39;t be anything quite like it. If you&#39;re looking for discovery, there are other places, but GitHub&#39;s recommendation algorithm (as basic as it is) is going to find you projects that you wouldn&#39;t have otherwise. It&#39;s unfortunate.</p><p>I think the tradeoffs are worth it. Do you?</p><hr/><p>Corrections? Comments?
