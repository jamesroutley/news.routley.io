<p>With Instant Payouts, Stripe lets you access your funds and pay them out to your bank account or debit card immediately. Starting June 1, 2024, the fee for <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/payouts/instant-payouts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Instant Payouts</u></a> in the US will increase from 1% to 1.5% per payout. You can always pay out your funds <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payouts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>using our standard schedule</u></a> (2 business days) for free. This applies to all direct Stripe accounts, as well as <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/connect/explore-connect-guide#account-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>standard connected accounts</u></a>. </p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>How can I calculate the impact of these fee changes to my business?</h3>

<h3>I’m a Connect platform. How does this affect my connected accounts?</h3>
<p>This applies to all direct Stripe accounts, as well as <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/connect/explore-connect-guide#account-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Standard connected accounts</u></a>. Stripe will automatically notify your Standard connected accounts about the change. They will also be able to see the new pricing when they opt for an Instant Payout. </p>
