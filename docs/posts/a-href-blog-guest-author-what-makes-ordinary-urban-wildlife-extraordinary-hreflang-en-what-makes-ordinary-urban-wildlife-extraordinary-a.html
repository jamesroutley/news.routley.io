    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <div><div><p>In writing a <a href="https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/florence-wilkinson/wild-city/9781398701878/"><u>book about urban wildlife</u></a> I wanted to open people&#39;s eyes to the wild creatures we don&#39;t expect to find in an urban environment – the cormorants at the <a href="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/nature-reserves/camley-street-natural-park"><u>Camley Street Natural Park</u></a>, the Daubenton&#39;s bats at <a href="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/woodberry-wetlands-nature-reserve"><u>Woodberry Wetlands</u></a>, the stag beetles at <a href="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/great-north-wood"><u>Great North Wood</u></a>. But I wanted to share my fondness for our more commonplace urban neighbours too; those animals that we regularly describe as pests, non-native or, worst of all, invasive.</p>
<p>This can bring up some thorny issues. It’s well known that grey squirrels have a <a href="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/mathew-frith/curtailed-will-contraception-spell-end-londons-grey-squirrels">hugely negative impact</a> on their red cousins (not to mention the damage a grey squirrel family caused when they found their way into my friend’s attic). Rats, and to a lesser extent pigeons, can pose a serious risk to public health. Ring-necked parakeets can locally outcompete native species… although it’s not known whether this is significant at a population scale.</p>
<p>And yet at the same time our cities are forever expanding, leaving precious little space for wildlife. I find the idea that we should sanitise almost any species out of existence in our urban centres concerning, especially since those animals that we call ‘feral’ or ‘invasive’ were invariably introduced by us in the first place.</p>

      </div><div>
          <div><p>We rightly celebrate the vibrant, multicultural melting pot that is our capital city, we fill our gardens and public spaces with plants and trees from across the globe, and yet we show little such hospitality to a grey squirrel or a ring-necked parakeet. While we’re making our planet increasingly inhospitable perhaps it’s time to rethink how we engage with those few creatures that are able to not just survive but to thrive in our wild cities.</p></div>
