    <h1>Hacking Reolink cameras for fun and profit (2020)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Way back in <a href="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/mastering-embedded-linux-part-2-hardware/">late 2019</a>, I dissected a Reolink B800 IP camera to demonstrate the various parts of an embedded Linux system.
It’s fairly nice hardware, actually—it has a 4K video sensor, a microphone, power over Ethernet, and is nominally waterproof.
And yes, it runs Linux.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/b800.jpg" alt="Reolink B800"/>
</figure>
<p>It came in a “kit” of six cameras and an NVR (a dedicated recording box that also powers the cameras).
Unfortunately, the NVR is pretty anemic: it’s clearly an existing model with slight changes to support 4K cameras, and it struggles to support more than one viewer at a time.</p>
<p>However, I bought these cameras because I believed they supported open standards such as ONVIF, so I’d just swap the NVR for a copy of Blue Iris running on my server.
At the time, the Reolink support page clearly indicated that all of their non-battery-powered cameras supported RTSP.
After the system was installed, it became apparent that the cameras did not in fact support RTSP—the only port open on them was port 9000.
Then, barely outside my return window, Reolink updated their support page to say that the cameras would only work with their 8-channel NVR or proprietary viewer apps.</p>
<p>This was, in the immortal words of Bill and Ted, bogus. Heinous. Most non-triumphant.</p>
<p>Bogus enough that I decided to pwn the camera, reverse engineer the protocol, and write my own software to get the video stream.
The end result is a <a href="https://github.com/thirtythreeforty/neolink">new piece of open-source software called Neolink</a>, which allows Blue Iris, Shinobi, or other NVR software to receive video from <em>unmodified</em> Reolink cameras.</p>
<p>Here’s how I did it.</p>
<h2 id="sniffing-traffic">Sniffing traffic</h2>
<p>As a first step, I fired up Wireshark and captured traffic between the camera and its official <a href="https://reolink.com/software-and-manual/">Reolink PC client</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/login-traffic.png" alt="The login stream"/>
</figure>
<p>The only thing that jumped out to me was the appearance of a sync word at the beginning of each packet, <code>0xf0debc0a</code>.
(In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Little-endian">little endian</a>, this is <code>0x0abcdef0</code>.)
On a lark, I Googled this, and actually found a <a href="https://github.com/nvella/sdvr">project on GitHub from 2015</a> which was attempting to retrieve data from Swann cameras!
A quick look at the code told me that although they share the sync word and packet header, the protocols for my camera and these older cameras were very different.
The payload appeared to be encrypted in my captures.
Furthermore, the code wouldn’t even run due to some questionable pointer juggling.
Time to extract what I could—the header layout was correct—and move on.</p>
<h3 id="dissecting-traffic-with-wireshark">Dissecting traffic with Wireshark</h3>
<p>Always, always spend time developing debug or analysis tools. In my experience, such tools immediately pay back your time investment by a factor of 4 or more.
With what I knew, I was able to write a “Baichuan” protocol dissector for Wireshark using <a href="https://mika-s.github.io/wireshark/lua/dissector/2017/11/04/creating-a-wireshark-dissector-in-lua-1.html">Mika’s awesome tutorial</a>.
This was easy and fun: Wireshark lets you write dissectors in Lua (<em>disclaimer: your definition of fun may vary</em>).
Now Wireshark could show me the payload lengths and message IDs.
Not much, but it was a start.</p>
<h2 id="inspecting-the-firmware">Inspecting the firmware</h2>
<p>In order to figure out whatever encryption and/or obfuscation the protocol was using, I planned to reverse engineer the firmware.
I felt pretty confident that the underlying video was using a well-known protocol (especially since the camera seemed to have dedicated video encoding hardware).
So “all” I’d have to do is reverse engineer the rest of the protocol.</p>
<p>Easy peasy, right?</p>
<h3 id="why-doesnt-this-camera-support-rtsp">Why doesn’t this camera support RTSP?</h3>
<p>As a quick aside, it’s natural to wonder why this camera doesn’t support RTSP and/or ONVIF.
After all, <a href="https://support.reolink.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007010473-How-to-Live-View-Reolink-Cameras-via-VLC-Media-Player">plenty of other Reolink cameras</a> do.
Because I’d like to give them the benefit of the doubt, I’ll propose the possibility that Reolink ran out of storage on this camera and had to axe some features.</p>
<p>After all, a 16MB flash chip would cost a whole 20 cents extra.
This is just a cost-saving measure and definitely not vendor lock-in, hmmm?</p>
<h2 id="pwning-the-camera">Pwning the camera</h2>
<p>Right, onward.
With the protocol not immediately accessible, it was time to crack this camera open.
My <a href="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/mastering-embedded-linux-part-2-hardware/">previous disassembly</a> of the camera has already indicated that it uses SPI NOR flash—bog standard for a small Linux system like this.
I was wanting to try out a really neat little SOIC socket I had discovered and ordered on Taobao a little while back.
I desoldered the flash and soldered on a socket instead.</p>
<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YIMo3sy0qIw" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>
<p>The camera was now pwned, permanently—there was nothing I could do to brick it (I could always just reflash it with <code>flashrom</code>) and there was nothing Reolink could do to stop me from running my own code on it (since I had control of the first instruction executed, if need be<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>).</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/socketed-flash.jpg" alt="The socketed flash"/>
</figure>
<p>With the flash now conveniently socketed, I dumped it and used <code>binwalk</code> to inspect the layout.
Here’s the flash layout—the nice round byte offsets that engineers tend to pick.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>

<p><code>binwalk</code> also conveniently offers to unpack the filesystems it finds.</p>
<h3 id="low-hanging-fruit-first">Low hanging fruit first</h3>
<p>My first order of business was to find the actual camera binary.
It was pretty easy to find; it’s sitting in its own directory at <code>/mnt/app/dvr</code>.
The <code>dvr</code> binary also had an accompanying <code>dvr.xml</code>, which looked like a configuration file.
A little grepping later, and… sure enough, here were the magic words <code>ONVIF</code> and <code>RTSP</code>!</p>

What if I just changed these zeros to ones?</p>

</figure>
<p>Rebuilding the rootfs wasn’t quite as easy as extracting it, but I cobbled together a command through trial and error.
I wanted to get the squashfs format exactly the same as the one reported by binwalk, so that I could be sure that the stock kernel would mount it.
Since I was mostly flying blind without a UART console, I didn’t want any trouble.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text">$ mksquashfs new-squashfs-root/ new-squashfs.img -comp xz -b 262144 -all-root -noappend

$ flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=A -w pwned.bin
</code></pre></div><p>Alas, it was not to be this easy.
The camera exhibited a remarkable lack of behavioral reform: no new ports opened, nothing.</p>
<p>For comparison, I downloaded and unpacked a firmware update for a different Reolink camera that did support RTSP.
The <code>dvr</code> binary for that camera was nearly 8 megabytes, while my victim’s was only a little over 3.
Clearly, the engineers compiled out the unneeded bits.</p>
<h3 id="getting-root">Getting root</h3>
<p>Fine.
If Reolink has compiled the extra functionality out, then the least the camera could do is give me a shell.
While I was here, I decided I’d make some, ahem, extra modifications.</p>
<p>A quick Google did not yield prebuilt binaries of the tools I was looking for.
Instead, I checked out a fresh copy of Buildroot and quickly set it up for a baseline MIPS configuration with static linking, then asked for copies of <code>gdbserver</code>, <code>busybox</code> with all the fixin’s, and <code>strace</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text">$ make qemu_mips32r2el_malta_defconfig
$ make menuconfig  # (with appropriate edits made)
$ make busybox gdb strace
</code></pre></div><p>Thirty minutes later, I had my tools.
In the rootfs tree that <code>binwalk</code> had extracted, there’s the usual assortment of startup scripts in <code>/etc/init.d</code>.
With my tricked-out Busybox copied to <code>/bin</code>, and a symlink created named <code>telnetd</code>, I added an extra line to one of the startup scripts:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span># Get a shell</span>
/bin/telnetd -l /bin/sh
</code></pre></div><p>Fingers crossed, I reinstalled the flash and powered the camera.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text">$ telnet 192.168.1.187

</figure>
<h2 id="reversing-the-protocol">Reversing the protocol</h2>
<p>What to do with my newfound power?
I planned to start with a static analysis of the firmware, first reverse engineering the encryption scheme.
If I got stuck, I could interrogate the camera binary as it executed.</p>
<p>Once I could undo the encryption, I’d be able to see what the actual protocol was like.</p>
<h3 id="static-analysis-with-ghidra">Static analysis with Ghidra</h3>
<p>The traditional hobbyist tool for static analysis, <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware/">IDA free edition</a>, is no good here, because my binary is for MIPS, which the free IDA refuses to disassemble.
Instead, the tool of choice is <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a>, an astoundingly good open-source reverse engineering suite released by the NSA.
Now, normally saying “I ran a binary the NSA gave me” will get you laughed out of the room.
But Ghidra has been open source for a while now, so I feel reasonably safe installing it from the Arch Linux repository.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/ghidra-website.png" alt="The Ghidra website"/><figcaption>
<p>If this website looks like it’s made by a government agency, it’s because it is.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ghidra is awesome.
Seriously, this is a piece of software you’d have to pay $10000 for, and it should be your go-to for reverse engineering work.
In addition to the disassembler and analyzer, Ghidra also includes a decompiler, which prints pseudo-C code instead of leaving you digging through MIPS assembly.
It also re-analyzes in realtime as you annotate function arguments with type information and names.
These features easily cut my time spent reverse engineering in half.</p>
<p>So, armed with Ghidra and a false sense of confidence stemming from never having done any reverse engineering before, I went spelunking in the Baichuan binaries.</p>
<h4 id="strings-a-bounty-of-information">Strings: a bounty of information</h4>
<p>There’s a reason most reverse engineers start by examining the strings in an unknown binary—it’s a technique that works.
In my case, checking for strings in the desktop client and the firmware’s server yielded debug print statements, function names (which Ghidra automatically annotated), and a couple other oddball strings that I’ll talk about in a minute.
Both codebases were clearly built around a shared proprietary “BCSDK” library.</p>
<p>Searching for <code>crypt</code> yielded a couple of candidate functions that purported to perform encryption:</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/crypt.png" alt="Functions matching crypt search"/>
</figure>
<p>Well, no RSA here, or anything resembling “real” encryption, except AES.
(And I could find any AES keys embedded in the app in short order.)</p>
<p>But what’s this string stuck nonchalantly in the middle of the others?</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/charlie.png" alt="A string referencing Charlie"/>
</figure>
<p>That’s not a function name.
I hit find-references and read the code that uses it.</p>
<h4 id="the-charlie-scrambler">The Charlie Scrambler</h4>
<p>Ghidra took me to this gem of a function:</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/charlie-scrambler.png" alt="The Charlie Scrambler in all its glory"/><figcaption>
<p>Technically, this is the decryption function; there’s another one that works in reverse.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It only takes a second to understand what’s going on here: the “encryption” scheme is simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>XOR the data with the string <code>Charlie is the designer of P2P!!</code>, then</li>
<li>mix up the bytes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t encryption.
This is just a scrambler.</p>
<p>Bravo, Charlie, your “design” is permanently encoded in this protocol for all time.
Don’t roll your own crypto, kids.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Charlie Scrambler is only called from UDP functions (see the cross-reference at the bottom of the Ghidra window).
This meant it wasn’t my pigeon; my camera uses TCP.
At this point I had no idea which of the other “encryption” functions were the right one for my camera, so it was time to bring out my next weapon.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-analysis-with-gdb">Dynamic analysis with gdb</h3>
<p>With my shell access waiting, my next move was to attach a debugger and control the dvr program remotely from my workstation using my cross-compiled <code>gdbserver</code> and <code>strace</code> tools.
My Busybox included an FTP server and a TCP wrapper:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text">$ /bin/busybox tcpsvd -vE 0.0.0.0 21 ftpd / -w -A
tcpsvd: listening on 0.0.0.0:21
</code></pre></div><p>With this setup I could push whatever tools I wanted to the camera filesystem, even though I hadn’t packed them into the firmware.
I went through this process manually about twice before it became really tedious.
This is the kind of thing it’s possible to automate with <code>expect</code>, a Tcl (!) program that pretends to be a console user.
I <a href="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/start-debug.exp">scripted these interactions</a>, which reduced the connect, tool push, and gdb setup to a simple:</p>
<p>An added benefit of this setup is that I could stick whatever gdb commands I wanted to run at startup at the end of the script, instead of writing a dedicated GDB script.
These <a href="https://doc.ecoscentric.com/gnutools/doc/gdb/Dynamic-Printf.html">dynamic printf commands</a> simply print in the GDB console when the camera hits a breakpoint, helpful for knowing which functions are being called without halting the camera:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text">send_gdb &#34;dprintf *0x478908, \&#34;_Nets_Without_Password_Login_V20\\n\&#34;&#34;
send_gdb &#34;dprintf *0x4780ac, \&#34;FUN_004780ac\\n\&#34;&#34;
send_gdb &#34;dprintf *0x6310f0, \&#34;Md5_string_encrypt\\n\&#34;&#34;
</code></pre></div><h4 id="feeding-the-watchdog">Feeding the watchdog</h4>
<p>After attaching and halting the dvr daemon, the camera promptly crashed and reset.
After some quick investigation, the camera had a watchdog enabled at <code>/dev/watchdog</code>—a very common setup for embedded devices.
I was doing open heart surgery on this software—I didn’t need some two-bit peripheral wandering by and hitting it with an AED!</p>
<p>Busybox ships with a watchdog minder, so I simply fired it up:</p>
<p>Problem solved.</p>
<h4 id="charlie-strikes-again">Charlie strikes again</h4>
<p>After my breakpoint was hit, I knew which encryption function I was dealing with: <code>Nets_XmlEncryption</code>.
This was immediately good news, because after figuring out the encryption, I was likely dealing with nice ordinary XML, not some crazy half-baked bag of C <code>structs</code>.</p>
<p>I took a look at the decompiled function in question in Ghidra, annotating as I went.
Sure did look familiar…</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/Nets_XmlEncryption.png" alt="The Nets_XmlEncryption disassembly"/>
</figure>
<p>No engineering lessons had been learned during the redesign, and the influence of Charlie was alive and well!
Here is the Charlie Scrambler back in force, but without the mixing step, and with a shorter key.</p>
<p>Fine, whatever.
Implementing the Scrambler in my Wireshark dissector didn’t take very long—although I was briefly baffled by a header of <em>varying length</em> depending on the message type.
Once implemented, I was greeted with this glorious sight:</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/baichuan-login.png" alt="The decrypted login message in Wireshark"/><figcaption>
<p>Again, I highly recommend writing plugins for Wireshark. You can do it in Lua (or C if you’re that hardcore), and it only takes a couple hours to have a really nice debug tool.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="a-brief-history-of-the-baichuan-protocol">A brief history of the Baichuan protocol</h3>
<p>I won’t bore you with the gory details, but I’ll summarize my findings.
The Baichuan protocol has had several iterations over the years.
The very oldest seem to be UDP-based, using a proprietary SDK called TUTK, illicit copies of which can conveniently be found on GitHub.
This is no longer used; it’s not even present in the camera code.</p>
<p>The next variant is indeed a plaintext “bag of structs”, which consists of a header and a body specified by a message ID in the header.
This “legacy variant” is briefly used on the B800 so that both clients can negotiate an upgrade to the “modern variant,” which is the scrambled XML-based scheme you see above.</p>
<p>On top of this, modern messages can optionally have a payload.
A certain XML message switches the entire message ID into “binary mode,” which supplies a raw data stream in subsequent messages.
When the client sends a video-start command, the camera replies with a binary stream containing raw H.265 video.
On top of <em>that</em>, the payload can also be <em>more</em> encrypted XML, separate from the main XML for some reason.</p>
<p>On the whole, it’s really quite a pain to parse.</p>
<h2 id="neolink-a-new-client">Neolink: a new client</h2>
<p>Once my Wireshark dissector was humming along, it was time to write a new client.
I wanted my software to be fast, high-level, and correct, since it would be part of a security system setup.</p>
<p>That’s right: I rewrote Reolink’s software in Rust.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/riir.png" alt="Rust evangelism strike force badge"/>
</figure>
<p>Well, not exactly.
Neolink is a new client completely from scratch.
It speaks the same Baichuan protocol as the camera, and it extracts the video and forwards it to another real NVR client like Blue Iris over RTSP.
The parsing code is somewhat hairy<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, but other than that, it’s straightforward.</p>
<h3 id="getting-the-video-data">Getting the video data</h3>
<p>Here’s all the client is capable of right now.
It’s pretty easy to read if you want to <a href="https://github.com/thirtythreeforty/neolink/blob/master/src/bc_protocol.rs">look at the source</a>.</p>

<p>For this part of the program I reached for Gstreamer, which ships with an RTSP server.
Gstreamer is… complex.
However, their examples are fantastic; they even provided a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/-/blob/master/examples/src/bin/rtsp-server.rs">sample RTSP server <em>in Rust</em></a>!</p>
<p>The general approach for feeding Gstreamer data from an arbitrary part of your program is to use a <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/app/appsrc.html">block called an <code>appsrc</code></a>.
This lets you get a callback whenever Gstreamer wants data, or alternatively just push data whenever you have some and let Gstreamer handle scheduling it.
The latter approach is the one I went with here, since the camera doesn’t wait for a signal to send video data.</p>
<p>I wrapped everything in a Gstreamer pipeline:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text">appsrc name=baichuan is-live=true emit-signals=false max-bytes=0 ! h265parse ! rtph265pay name=pay0
</code></pre></div><h3 id="testing-it-with-blue-iris">Testing it with Blue Iris</h3>
<p>The moment of truth arrived… could Blue Iris connect to my RTSP server and actually display the video?</p>
<p>You bet.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>I’ve been soak-testing Neolink for a while now and I think it’s pretty stable.
Going forward I’m packaging it up as a real Windows service (not a command line program) to run alongside Blue Iris on my server.
<a href="https://github.com/thirtythreeforty/neolink">Go look at it and download it for yourself!</a></p>
<p>I’m also interested in getting Neolink working with other “NVR only” Reolink cameras, of which there are quite a few.
So far I haven’t purchased any other hardware, so if you have one of these cameras, please get in touch so we can test it.
It might Just Work out of the box.
Port scan your cameras!
If they have port 9000 available, chances are good that they speak the Baichuan protocol.</p>
<p>This project was a “just right” intro to reverse engineering.
Low-security systems like these let you teach yourself the principles without actively trying to thwart reverse engineering.
I taught myself a lot, and I hope it provides a lot of value for folks who own these cameras.</p>
<p>Finally, some shameless self-promotion: embedded Linux systems are actually pretty approachable!
If you’d like to learn how to do this kind of thing, you might be interested in my <a href="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/08/mastering-embedded-linux-part-1-concepts/">Mastering Embedded Linux series</a>, designed to help you become an expert in hacking low-cost embedded Linux systems just like this camera.</p>
