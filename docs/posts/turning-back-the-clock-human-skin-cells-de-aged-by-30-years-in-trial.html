    <h1>Turning back the clock: Human skin cells de-aged by 30 years in trial</h1>

        <p>Researchers have reversed ageing in human skin cells by 30 years, according to a new study.</p><p>While findings are still in the early stages, they could revolutionise regenerative medicine, especially if it can be replicated in other cell types.</p>
<p>Scientists in the study, published in eLife, said they developed a method to time jump human skin cells by three decades, rewinding the ageing clock without cells losing their function.</p><p>Researchers were able to partly restore the function of older cells, as well as renew the biological age.</p><p>In experiments that simulated a skin wound, the partially rejuvenated cells showed signs of behaving more like youthful cells.</p>

<p>Professor Wolf Reik, a group leader in the Epigenetics research programme who has recently moved to lead the Altos Labs Cambridge Institute, said: &#34;This work has very exciting implications.</p>
<p>&#34;Eventually, we may be able to identify genes that rejuvenate without reprogramming, and specifically target those to reduce the effects of ageing.</p>    
<p>&#34;This approach holds promise for valuable discoveries that could open up an amazing therapeutic horizon.&#34;</p><p>Dr Diljeet Gill, a postdoctoral researcher in Prof Reik&#39;s lab at the Babraham Institute, said: &#34;Our results represent a big step forward in our understanding of cell reprogramming.</p><p>&#34;We have proved that cells can be rejuvenated without losing their function and that rejuvenation looks to restore some function to old cells.</p><p>&#34;The fact that we also saw a reverse of ageing indicators in genes associated with diseases is particularly promising for the future of this work.&#34;</p> <div>

<p>As people age, their cells&#39; ability to function declines and the genome - DNA blueprint - accumulates marks of ageing.</p><p>Regenerative biology aims to repair or replace cells, including old ones.</p><p>One of the most important tools in regenerative biology is our ability to create &#39;induced&#39; stem cells.</p><p>However, this process essentially wipes the cells of their function and gives them the potential to become any cell type.</p>
