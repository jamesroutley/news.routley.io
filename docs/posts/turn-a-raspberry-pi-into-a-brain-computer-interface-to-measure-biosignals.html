      <span>Abstract:</span>  This paper presents an inexpensive, high-precision, but at the same time,
easy-to-maintain PIEEG board to convert a RaspberryPI to a Brain-computer
interface. This shield allows measuring and processing eight real-time EEG
(Electroencephalography) signals. We used the most popular programming
languages - C, C++ and Python to read the signals, recorded by the device . The
process of reading EEG signals was demonstrated as completely and clearly as
possible. This device can be easily used for machine learning enthusiasts to
create projects for controlling robots and mechanical limbs using the power of
thought. We will post use cases on GitHub
(<a href="https://github.com/Ildaron/EEGwithRaspberryPI" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>) for controlling a robotic
machine, unmanned aerial vehicle, and more just using the power of thought.
