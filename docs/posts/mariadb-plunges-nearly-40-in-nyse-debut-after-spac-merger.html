    <p>MariaDB plc stock plunged nearly 40% on the New York Stock Exchange Monday after the cloud database software provider debuted as the 16th Bay Area business to go public this year in a merger with a blank check company. </p>

<p>Shares of the Finnish company, whose U.S. headquarters and CEO are based in Redwood City, dropped to as much as 46% below the $11.10 price where the shares of merger partner Angel Pond Holding Corp. (NYSE:POND) closed on Friday. They fell as low as $5.98 in the first hour of trading on Monday and finished the day at $6.70.</p>

            <!--Ad Tag - c1 (xs/xm/md)-->
            
            
        <p>MariaDB (NYSE:MRDB) declined to disclose how much it raised in the deal when asked by the Business Journal, but its market cap at the end of the day on Monday was about $650 million.</p>

                
                    <p>About 99% of the shareholders of special purpose acquisition company Angel Pond got their money back before the merger was completed, wiping out about nearly $263 million in capital that the companies had projected could be raised in the deal.</p>

<p>MariaDB&#39;s eponymously named open-source software is used to store, manage and manipulate data across applications. Users include Google LLC and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. Its software was created in 2009 by some of the original developers of the MySQL database who were concerned about the future of that application after Oracle Corp. bought MySQL owner Sun Microsystems Inc.</p>

<p>The company employs about 300 in total, with about 40 of those in the Bay Area. </p>

<p>MariaDB hasn&#39;t updated disclosures of its financial performance since a February investor presentation in which it said that had an operating loss of $26.6 million on sales of $34.7 million in the fiscal year that ended in September 2021. That compares with an operating loss of $20.4 million on revenue of $30.7 million in fiscal 2020.</p>

<p>The company in February projected an operating loss of $43.2 million this fiscal year on sales of $47.4 million and an operating loss of $44.7 million in fiscal 2023 on sales of $63.5 million.</p>
