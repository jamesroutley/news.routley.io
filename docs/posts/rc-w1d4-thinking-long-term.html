      <div><p>In my previous post, I shared thoughts on building patience. A discussion followed on RC chat which highlighted two aspects of patience.<br/></p><div>
<p>The first relates to ‘patience to deal with finicky technical things’. I feel I’ve gotten better at this over time. In earlier days I would Stack Overflow just enough to get past the problem I was facing. More recently I try to be more deliberate on spending more time to read documentation, and where necessary, the source code. Ben Kuhn says this best in his <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/blub/">post</a>.</p>

<p>The second, which is what I had in mind, relates to ‘patience in dealing with other people and organizational issues’. I used to (and in weaker moments still do) focus on getting OKR’s done fast and aim to be the ‘10x engineer’ on the team. Now I try to be more deliberate about longer-term issues surrounding the work. How does the work relate to my team’s goals? Stakeholder teams goals? The org&#39;s goals? What does the company product roadmap look like and how does the work fit in in the bigger picture? A few months back I wrote a design doc that other engineers executed on, which I hope is first of many.</p>

<p>Another way to think about the latter form is, if you’re hired to build out a team to achieve company objectives, how would you go about doing it? This requires a mental shift from thinking what you would do in a quarter, to how to prioritize and execute and hire over multiple years. This framing also helps you empathize with the challenges your manager is facing.</p>
