    <h1>Ask HN: Do you hate software engineering but love programming?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have come to a realization that I don&#39;t really enjoy Software Engineering(&amp; the processes that it comes with) but I do love programming &amp; solving problems.</p><p>Finding and fixing bugs is a lot of fun. Incidence response is a lot of fun. Hacking on new projects is a lot of fun. Writing unit tests is fun too.</p><p>Refactoring, rewriting, sprint, agile, rearchitecting things etc aren&#39;t that fun. I like a few languages and I am not too keen on learning new paradigms or languages unless I have to. I&#39;d rather get to value now by making something that just works(and is adequately tested) than engineer something thats future proof but takes longer to get out.</p><p>What are some good jobs for a person like this?</p></div></div></div>
