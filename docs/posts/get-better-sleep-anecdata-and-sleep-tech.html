<p>I recently got 8.5 hours of the best sleep of my adult life–a culmination of a
month of being mindful of my sleep habits. We spend anywhere between a
quarter to half of our lives asleep. Yet, it doesn’t seem many people are
intentional about this aspect of their lives.</p>

<p>I have been interested in sleep tracking since I was in high school, but have
not actively tried to improve my perceived quality. Over the past year I tried
to change that and have felt a noticeable improvement. I posted a story on
Instagram to my extended friends circle, which received more feedback than I
expected. A lot of people were interested in what I was doing to optimize my
sleep, so I thought I’d share.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>The cornerstone of getting better sleep is tracking it. As the adage goes, <em>you
can’t manage what you can’t measure</em>. I’ve been using
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-sleep-tracker/id320606217">Sleep Cycle,</a>
which is
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleep-watch-by-bodymatter/id1138066420">one</a>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pillow-auto-sleep-tracker/id878691772">of</a>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-track-sleep-on-watch/id1164801111">many</a>
apps that claim to track your sleep. I bought the Sleep Cycle app waaay back
in 2014. Anecdotally, I’ve found their cycle tracking to be somewhat
accurate and their ability to wake me in “non-deep” sleep pretty spot on. The
concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle">sleep cycles</a> is borne out in the
science literature (i.e. the difference between
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep">REM sleep</a>
and non-REM sleep). And it seems that at least one
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjPng54_CtE">sleep researcher</a>
found that the app did correlate to real sleep cycles. Most of all, I like the
sleep score, regularity, and other statistics that the app lays out bare for you
to draw your own conclusions. I also happen to be an early adopter, so I’ve been
grandfathered into the subscription features.</p>

<h2 id="white-noise">White Noise</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jnvr1Re.jpg" alt="Sleep Quality vs Weather" width="80%"/></p>

<p>The second thing I noticed was that the Sleep Cycle app consistently reported
higher sleep scores on rainy nights. The white noise that a fan makes has always
helped me fall asleep–since I was a kid. So, I started using the app’s
built-in “Rain on Car Roof” sleep aid on top of the fan I have running in
my room. I have since been falling asleep much faster.</p>

<h2 id="weighted-blanket">Weighted Blanket</h2>

<p>The third piece of sleep “technology”–likely the secret sauce–has been a
<a href="https://chillablankets.com/">weighted blanket.</a>
<a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8636">The</a>
<a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/health-and-wellness/2019/february/weighted-blankets">science</a>
seems to suggest that weighted blankets can help with sleep disorders. I do not
think I have any major issues with sleep, but I’ve found that a weighted blanket
improves my sleep score. I’ve only had mine for ~1 month, but
the initial data shows an upward trending sleep score.</p>

<h2 id="qualitative-observations">Qualitative Observations</h2>

<p>On the even more anecdotal side, I’ve found that a couple of other key factors
help the cause:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being tired before bed (especially from working out that day)</li>
  <li>Not having eaten food 1.5 hours before bed</li>
  <li>Waking up at a consistent time</li>
  <li>Refraining from phone screen-time in bed</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve found that bedtime matters less for me personally. Looking into it, it
seems some doctors
<a href="https://www.headspace.com/articles/sleep-health-2-consistent-wake-up-time-sleeps-surprising-mvp">have echoed similar ideas.</a></p>

<h2 id="social-media">Social Media</h2>

<p>The hardest habit that I have broken this year was scrolling on social media
before bed. I would say this is the second most important aspect to better
sleep. I’ve found that killing a habit without replacing it / concessions
doesn’t work. Here were mine: I allow myself to instead listen to podcasts at
night, which seems to have filled that gap. I try to pick ones that are on the
shorter side, like 20ish minutes, which also seems to give me a chance to wind
down. Second, I deleted all social media apps on my phone but give myself
unlimited time to browse on a desktop computer. Desktop sites don’t seem to have
as optimized algorithms for endless scrolling. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ve found that there are
more natural stopping points when you are on a desktop computer.</p>

<h2 id="waking-up">Waking up</h2>

<p>The part of sleep that people sometimes forget to talk about is waking up.
I’ve already talked about using an app to try to wake up in a lighter phase of
sleep. In addition, I’ve found that a waking up routine really helps.</p>

<p>I make sure to have a full water bottle at night–a swig of water in the morning
wakes me right up. I also run through a couple of cards on
<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>
and run through an exercise on
<a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>. <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
Though not critical, I’ve found that doing these mental exercises wakes my mind
up and stops me from drifting back to sleep. It also acts as a two-for-one since
I make sure to keep the habit in both apps going since I do it first thing in
the morning.</p>

<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DTjMO7I.jpg" alt="Sleep Cycle Trend Line" width="60%"/></p>

<p>This is a snapshot of sleep cycle over the last couple of months. I had taken a
break from tracking my sleep at the start of the pandemic, but got back into it
when I was at Carnegie Mellon in person for grad school. I put into practice
some waking up habits in mid-November, but I really kicked up the focus in late
December with the weighted blankets, social media restrictions, and white noise.
I plan to continue to track the results of these changes this year.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The long-short of it all, in rough relative order of importance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Track your sleep with a <a href="https://www.sleepcycle.com/">sleep tracking app</a></li>
  <li>Get a <a href="https://chillablankets.com/">weighted blanket</a></li>
  <li>Refrain from phone use in bed</li>
  <li>Use a sleep aid (specifically <a href="https://www.sleepcycle.com/sleep-sounds-music/sounds-to-sleep-by/">rain sounds</a>)</li>
  <li>Exercise on days you want to get good sleep (being tired)</li>
  <li>Implement instant wake up habits (e.g. drinking water)</li>
  <li>Have a regular wake-up time</li>
  <li>Eat food 1.5 hours before bed</li>
</ul>
