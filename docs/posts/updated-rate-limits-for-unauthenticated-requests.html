    <h1>Updated rate limits for unauthenticated requests</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>To provide a secure and dependable experience on GitHub, we’re rolling out updates to rate limits for requests made without authentication. These changes will apply to operations like cloning repositories over HTTPS, anonymously interacting with our REST APIs, and downloading files from raw.githubusercontent.com.</p>
<h2 id="why-were-updating" id="why-were-updating">Why we’re updating<a href="#why-were-updating" aria-label="Why we’re updating"></a></h2>
<p>We’ve recently observed an increase in scraping activity targeting our API. These updates reflect our ongoing commitment to safeguarding the platform and ensuring GitHub remains a stable, reliable environment for developers worldwide.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-you" id="what-this-means-for-you">What this means for you<a href="#what-this-means-for-you" aria-label="What this means for you"></a></h2>
<p>If you rely on unauthenticated access, you may experience the new rate limits. However, developers using authenticated requests will continue to enjoy <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28">higher rate limits</a> with uninterrupted access to their workflows and tools. We encourage you to use authentication for enhanced consistency and reliability in accessing GitHub’s services.</p>
