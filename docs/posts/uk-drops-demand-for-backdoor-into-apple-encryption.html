In response, Apple pulled the ability for new users in the UK to sign up to its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617273/apple-removes-encryption-advanced-data-protection-adp-uk-spying-backdoor">Advanced Data Protection</a> (ADP) encrypted iCloud storage offering, and challenged the order, winning the right to publicly discuss the case in April. Earlier this year, US officials started examining whether the UK order had violated the bilateral CLOUD Act agreement, which bars the UK and US from issuing demands for each other’s data.</p><p>This pressure from the US <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/710504/uk-apple-encryption-back-door-icloud-adp-backing-down">sparked reports last month</a> that Britain would walk back the demands it issued to Apple, with one unnamed UK official telling the <em>Financial Times</em> that the UK “had its back against the wall,” and was looking for a way out. While it’s unclear if the UK would negotiate new terms with Apple that avoid implicating the data of US citizens, an unnamed US official told <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ab0aba27-81e0-4ee5-bcbb-6bce85386e40"><em>The Financial Times</em></a> that such negotiations would not be faithful to the new agreement.</p><p>With the order now reportedly removed, it’s unclear if Apple will restore access to its ADP service in the UK. We have reached out to Apple for comment. The UK Home Office has refused to comment on the situation.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div>
