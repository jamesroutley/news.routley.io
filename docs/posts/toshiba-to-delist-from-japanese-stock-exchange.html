    <h1>Toshiba to delist from Japanese stock exchange</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Japanese conglomerate Toshiba Corp. said Thursday it will be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Dec. 20, ending its 74-year-long history as a public company, as it seeks to rebuild itself following a takeover bid.</p>
<p>Last month, a 2 trillion yen ($13 billion) takeover bid for Toshiba by a consortium led by Japan Industrial Partners Inc. ended in success.</p>
<p>Toshiba also said it will convene an extraordinary shareholders&#39; meeting on Nov. 22 in Tokyo to discuss share consolidation and other agendas in a bid to squeeze out remaining shareholders.</p>
<p>The JIP-led group, which consists of companies such as financial firm Orix Corp. and semiconductor company Rohm Co., has acquired a 78.65 percent stake in Toshiba through the tender offer.</p>
<p>The bid was intended to allow Toshiba to sever ties with overseas activist shareholders, who it says were only seeking short-term returns.</p>
<p>Toshiba, one of Japan&#39;s leading companies, was founded in 1875. It started as an electric appliance maker and gradually branched out into new business sectors such as infrastructure and renewable energy.</p>
<p>Toshiba has been struggling to recover from a spate of problems that occurred in the 2010s, including a scandal related to overstating its profits in financial filings. It also incurred massive losses in its U.S. nuclear business during the same period.</p>
