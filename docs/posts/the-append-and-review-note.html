    <p>A few words on an approach to note taking that I stumbled on and has worked for me quite well for many years. I call it the <em>&#34;append-and-review note&#34;</em>. I find that this approach strikes a good balance of being super simple and easy to use but it also captures the majority of day-to-day note taking use cases.</p>

<p><strong>Data structure.</strong> I maintain one single text note in the Apple Notes app just called &#34;notes&#34;. Maintaining more than one note and managing and sorting them into folders and recursive substructures costs way too much cognitive bloat. A single note means CTRL+F is simple and trivial. Apple does a good job of optional offline editing, syncing between devices, and backup.</p>
<p><strong>Append.</strong> Any time any idea or any todo or anything else comes to mind, I append it to the note on top, simply as text. Either when I&#39;m on my computer when working, or my iPhone when on the go. I don&#39;t find that tagging these notes with any other structured metadata (dates, links, concepts, tags) is that useful and I don&#39;t do it by default. The only exception is that I use tags like &#34;watch:&#34;, &#34;listen:&#34;, or &#34;read:&#34;, so they are easy to CTRL+F for when I&#39;m looking for something to watch late at night, listen to during a run/walk, or read during a flight, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Review.</strong> As things get added to the top, everything else starts to sink towards the bottom, almost as if under gravity. Every now and then, I fish through the notes by scrolling downwards and skimming. If I find anything that deserves to not leave my attention, I rescue it towards the top by simply copy pasting. Sometimes I merge, process, group or modify notes when they seem related. I delete a note only rarely. Notes that repeatedly don&#39;t deserve attention will naturally continue to sink. They are never lost, they just don&#39;t deserve the top of mind.</p>
<p>Example usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Totally random idea springs to mind but I&#39;m on the go and can&#39;t think about it, so I add it to the note, to get back around to later.</li>
<li>Someone at a party mentions a movie I should watch.</li>
<li>I see a glowing review of a book while doom scrolling through X.</li>
<li>I sit down in the morning and write a small TODO list for what I&#39;d like to achieve that day.</li>
<li>I just need some writing surface for something I&#39;m thinking about.</li>
<li>I was going to post a tweet but I think it needs a bit more thought. Copy paste into notes to think through a bit more later.</li>
<li>I find an interesting quote and I want to be reminded of it now and then.</li>
<li>My future self should really think about this thing more.</li>
<li>I&#39;m reading a paper and I want to note some interesting numbers down.</li>
<li>I&#39;m working on something random and I just need a temporary surface to CTRL+C and CTRL+V a few things around.</li>
<li>I keep forgetting that shell command that lists all Python files recursively so now I keep it in the note.</li>
<li>I&#39;m running a hyperparameter sweep of my neural network and I record the commands I ran and the eventual outcome of the experiment.</li>
<li>I feel stressed that there are too many things on my mind and I worry that I&#39;ll lose them, so I just sit down and quickly dump them into a bullet point list.</li>
<li>I realize while I&#39;m re-ordering some of my notes that I&#39;ve actually thought about the same thing a lot but from different perspectives. I process it a bit more, merge some of the notes into one. I feel additional insight.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I note something down, I feel that I can immediately move on, wipe my working memory, and focus fully on something else at that time. I have confidence that I&#39;ll be able to revisit that idea later during review and process it when I have more time.</p>
<p>My note has grown quite giant over the last few years. It feels nice to scroll through some of the old things/thoughts that occupied me a long time ago. Sometimes ideas don&#39;t stand the repeated scrutiny of a review and they just sink deeper down. Sometimes I&#39;m surprised that I&#39;ve thought about something for so long. And sometimes an idea from a while ago is suddenly relevant in a new light.</p>
<p>One text note ftw.</p>
