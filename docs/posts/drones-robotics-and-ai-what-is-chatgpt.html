Neither are still true.”</p><p><span><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2></span></p><p>Trained by AI and machine learning, the system is designed to provide information and answer questions through a conversational interface.</p><p>The AI is trained on a huge sample of text taken from the internet.</p><p>OpenAI said the new AI was created with a focus on ease of use. “The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests,” the research body said in a <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/" data-link-name="in body link">statement</a> last week.</p><p><span><h2 id="how-can-it-be-used">How can it be used?</h2></span></p><p>Early users have described the technology as an alternative to Google because it is capable of providing descriptions, answers and solutions to complex questions including ways to write code, and solve layout problems and optimisation queries.</p><p>Real-world applications could include generating content for websites, answering customer inquiries, providing recommendations as well as creating automated chatbots.</p><p>Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, said the system was “an early demo of what’s possible”. “Soon you will be able to have helpful assistants that talk to you, answer questions, and give advice. Later you can have something that goes off and does tasks for you. Eventually you can have something that goes off and discovers new knowledge for you.”</p><p><span><h2 id="could-chatgpt-replace-humans">Could ChatGPT replace humans?</h2></span></p><p>There has been speculation that professions dependent upon content production could be rendered obsolete, including everything from playwrights and professors to programmers and journalists.</p><p>In the days since it was released, academics have generated responses to exam queries that they say would result in full marks if submitted by an undergraduate, and programmers have used the tool to solve coding challenges in obscure programming languages in a matter of seconds.</p><p>The ability to generate human-like written text has prompted suggestions that the technology could replace journalists.</p><p>However at its current stage, the chatbot lacks the nuance, critical-thinking skills or ethical decision-making ability that are essential for successful journalism.</p><p>Its current knowledge base ends in 2021, rendering some queries and searches useless.</p><p>ChatGPT can also give entirely wrong answers and present misinformation as fact, writing “plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers”, the company concedes.</p><p>OpenAI says that fixing this issue is difficult because there is no source of truth in the data they use to train the model and supervised training can also be misleading “because the ideal answer depends on what the model knows, rather than what the human demonstrator knows”.</p></div></div></div>
