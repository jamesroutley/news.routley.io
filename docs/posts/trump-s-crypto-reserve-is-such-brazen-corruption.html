The former three tokens are popular among Trump’s crypto industry and tech allies – and the president himself. The </span><a href="https://zeteo.com/p/what-is-trump-memecoin-explainer" rel="">$TRUMP shitcoin</a><span> released during inauguration weekend was made on the Solana blockchain, as was the $MELANIA token.</span></p><p><span>This wouldn’t just be a giveaway to Trump’s crypto donors, who would see their bags swell if the federal government started buying crypto. It would be pure self-dealing for Trump and his sons, who have embraced crypto’s money-from-nothing potential with ventures like </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-connection-why-some-bought-world-liberty-financial-tokens-2025-01-23/" rel="">World Liberty Financial</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/trump-media-launches-fintech-services-brand-2025-01-29/" rel="">Trump Media’s forthcoming fintech investment fund</a><span>. The benefits for them have been obvious. Besides the $TRUMP token – which potentially yielded nearly</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/trumps-meme-coin-made-nearly-100-million-trading-fees-small-traders-lost-money-2025-02-03/" rel=""> $100 million in fees</a><span> and profits for Trump-world figures on the inside of the pump-and-dump – World Liberty Financial has received </span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/02/sec-fraud-prosecution-chinese-crypto-entrepreneur-justin-sun-donald-trump-world-liberty-financial-tokens/" rel="">$75 million from Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun</a><span>. Last week, Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission, now purged of its Biden-era crypto enforcement team, </span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/02/sec-fraud-prosecution-chinese-crypto-entrepreneur-justin-sun-donald-trump-world-liberty-financial-tokens/" rel="">dropped its fraud case</a><span> against Sun. This system of payola works just as it was designed.</span></p><p><span>Signaling what this crypto reserve is really all about, token prices </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-crypto-bitcoin-digital-assets-reserve-2f4246434a657f248cd85296f14382f9" rel="">spiked significantly</a><span> after Trump’s announcement. Some whales – huge bagholders – made large, suspiciously timed trades that raised questions about whether there was any foreknowledge of the announcement. But the pump didn’t last long. Within 24 hours, token prices had </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-crypto-bitcoin-digital-assets-reserve-2f4246434a657f248cd85296f14382f9" rel="">slid</a><span> to about what they were before the president’s announcement as even some prominent Trump tech allies started questioning the initiative.</span></p><p><span>“Taxation is theft. It should be kept to a minimum,” </span><a href="https://x.com/JTLonsdale/status/1896245689488920748" rel="">wrote venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale on X</a><span>. “It’s wrong to steal my money for grift on the left; it’s also wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes.”</span></p><p><span>“Nobody announced a tax or a spending program,” </span><a href="https://x.com/DavidSacks/status/1896482883424211188" rel="">responded David Sacks</a><span>, the venture capitalist serving as </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/david-sacks-crypto-ai-trump.html" rel="">Trump’s AI &amp; crypto czar</a><span>, who has invested in crypto companies through his venture-capital firm Craft Ventures, including ones involved with Solana. Sacks said that he has sold his personal crypto holdings. “Maybe you should wait to find out what’s actually being proposed.”</span></p><p><span>The money has to come from </span><em>somewhere</em><span>. Asked on X to clarify what exactly is being proposed, Sacks didn’t respond.</span></p><p>Crypto helped get Trump back to the White House. </p></div></div></div>
