    <h1>Tool touted as &#39;first AI software engineer&#39; is bad at its job, testers claim</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A service described as &#34;the first AI software engineer&#34; appears to be rather bad at its job, based on a recent evaluation.</p>
<p>The auto-coder is called “Devin” and was <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cognition.ai/blog/introducing-devin">introduced</a> in March 2024. The bot’s creator, an outfit called Cognition AI, has made claims such as “Devin can build and deploy apps end to end,&#34; and &#34;can autonomously find and fix bugs in codebases.&#34; The tool <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cognition.ai/blog/devin-generally-available">reached general availability</a> in December 2024, starting at $500 per month.</p>
<p>&#34;Devin is an autonomous AI software engineer that can write, run and test code, helping software engineers work on personal tasks or their team projects,&#34; Cognition&#39;s <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.devin.ai/get-started/devin-intro">documentation</a> declares. It &#34;can review PRs, support code migrations, respond to on-call issues, build web applications, and even perform personal assistant tasks like ordering your lunch on DoorDash so you can stay locked in on your codebase.&#34;</p>

    

<p>The service uses Slack as its main interface for commands, which are sent to its computing environment, a Docker container that hosts a terminal, browser, code editor, and planner. The AI agent supports API integration with external services. This allows it, for example, to send email messages on a user&#39;s behalf via SendGrid.</p>

        


        

<p>Devin is a &#34;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cognition.ai/blog/evaluating-coding-agents">compound AI system</a>,&#34; meaning it relies on multiple underlying AI models, a set that has included OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4o and can be expected to evolve over time.</p>
<p>In theory, you should be able to ask it to undertake tasks like migrating code to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a>, a Jupyter Notebook development platform, and expect it to do so successfully. But that may be asking too much.</p>

        

<p>Early assessments of Devin have found problems. Cognition AI posted a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTS2Hz96HYQ">promo video</a> that supposedly showed the AI coder autonomously completing projects on the freelancer-for-hire platform Upwork. Software developer <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/carlbrown">Carl Brown</a> analyzed that vid and debunked it on his <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNmgmwEtoWE">Internet of Bugs YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>The software agent was also called out by another YouTube code pundit for allegedly including <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=927W6zzvV-c">critical security issues</a>.</p>
<p>Now, three data scientists affiliated with <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://answer.ai">Answer.AI</a>, an AI research and development lab founded by Jeremy Howard and Eric Ries, have <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://devin.ai/">tested Devin</a> and found it completed just three out of 20 tasks successfully.</p>

<p>In an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2025-01-08-devin.html#what-is-devin">analysis</a> conducted earlier this month by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://hamel.dev/">Hamel Husain</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://isaac-flath.github.io/website/blog.html">Isaac Flath</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://johnowhitaker.dev/">Johno Whitaker</a>, Devin started well, successfully pulling data from a Notion database into Google Sheets. The AI agent also managed to create a planet tracker for checking claims about the historical positions of Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
<p>But as the three researchers continued their testing, they encountered problems.</p>

        

<p>&#34;Tasks that seemed straightforward often took days rather than hours, with Devin getting stuck in technical dead-ends or producing overly complex, unusable solutions,&#34; the researchers explain in their report. &#34;Even more concerning was Devin’s tendency to press forward with tasks that weren’t actually possible.&#34;</p>
<p>As an example, they cited how Devin, when asked to deploy multiple applications to the infrastructure deployment platform <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://railway.com/">Railway</a>, failed to understand this wasn&#39;t supported and spent more than a day trying approaches that didn&#39;t work and hallucinating non-existent features.</p>
<p>Of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2025-01-08-devin.html#appendix-tasks-attempted-with-devin">20 tasks presented to Devin</a>, the AI software engineer completed just three of them satisfactorily – the two cited above and a third challenge to research how to build a Discord bot in Python. Three other tasks produced inconclusive results, and 14 projects were outright failures.</p>
<p>The researchers said that Devin provided a polished user experience that was impressive when it worked.</p>
<p>&#34;But that’s the problem – it rarely worked,&#34; they wrote.</p>
<p>&#34;More concerning was our inability to predict which tasks would succeed. Even tasks similar to our early wins would fail in complex, time-consuming ways. The autonomous nature that seemed promising became a liability – Devin would spend days pursuing impossible solutions rather than recognizing fundamental blockers.&#34;</p>
