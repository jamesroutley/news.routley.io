    <h1>Gothic Architecture Became Spooky</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Twenty-five years ago, Dr. Robert Bork, a professor of art history at the University of Iowa and a specialist in the study of Gothic architecture, was working in his office when a student knocked on the door. Throughout the room were pictures of Cologne Cathedral, an 1880 church in Germany and one of Dr. Bork’s favorite buildings. The images, seemingly, caught the student’s attention. “Dr. Bork,” he said. “Why does it look so evil?”</p><p>There is nothing inherently scary or sinister about the structure. As an example of Gothic architecture, it bears many iconic elements of the style: pointed arches, flying buttresses, tall spires, rib vaults, window tracery, and stained glass. But it was never meant to invoke fear. So the student’s question was interesting to the professor. “I asked him why he said that,” Dr. Bork tells <em>AD.</em> “And he replied, ‘Well, it looks just like the skyscraper in <em>Ghostbusters.</em>’”</p><figure><p><span><p>Cologne Cathedral in Cologne, Germany</p>

In <em>Dracula</em> (1931) Carfax Abbey is based on Whitby Abbey, a Gothic monastery; Manderly from Alfred Hitchcock’s R<em>ebecca</em> (1939) pulls inspiration from Gothic houses; and more modern films and shows like <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/crimson-peak-set-design-exclusive-video"><em>Crimson Peak</em></a> (2015) and <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/wednesday-on-netflix-inside-the-castle-used-for-nevermore-academy"><em>Wednesday</em></a> (2022) keep the trope alive.</p><p>“The idea of Gothic buildings being scary or haunted is fairly recent,” says Michael Crosbie, an architect and professor of the course Architecture in Film at Hartford University. “In the early to mid 20th century, there were a lot of Gothic buildings in movies that showed them as haunted places.”</p><p>One could argue that repetition has perhaps conditioned viewers to think of the style as scary, so creators continue using it, prompting something of a never-ending loop. But their original introduction into horror media was always a deliberate choice. “It’s not random,” Dr. Bork says. “There are good reasons.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><figure><p><span><p>Notre-Dame in Paris is among the most famous Gothic buildings.</p>

In religious settings, it was meant to suggest the superhuman. “Buildings were supposed to make you feel like you were in the presence of a bigger, more mysterious God,” Dr. Bork says. Architects did this by circumventing many of the “rules” previously established in Romanesque architecture, which had been widespread in the decades before and has roots in <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/greek-architecture-101" target="_blank">Greek</a> and <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/roman-architecture-101" target="_blank">Roman</a> classicism.</p><figure><p><span><p>Built in 1790, the exterior of the Pantheon in Paris showcases a neoclassical style, with direct references to Greek and Roman design.</p>

In fact, each order of Greek design—Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian—was based on the human body, and therefore felt safe, approachable, and familiar. As Gothic architecture emerged, many <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/neoclassical-architecture-explained" target="_blank">classical traditions</a> receded. “In the Middle Ages, [architects] left behind the human metaphor and moved to the superhuman,” Dr. Bork adds.</p><p>Suddenly, columns became arbitrarily tall and stretched, ornamentation grew bolder, and interiors felt more cavernous thanks to new construction techniques that allowed higher ceilings and required less interior columns. Architects pushed the envelope and were willing to experiment outside of what was previously deemed correct or right. The general vertical presence through elongated columns and high ceilings was meant to evoke a heavenly reach.</p><figure><p><span><p>Inside Notre Dame Basilica of Montreal.

However, the designs assumed a less favorable association in the early 16th century during the Renaissance, when there was once again a desire for the rules, order, and “perfection” of classical antiquity. “It was perceived as lawless, chaotic, and disorderly because it didn’t follow the rules of classicism,” Dr. Bork explains. “It got stuck with that association.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Throughout the next two centuries, the style largely lost favor, until Horace Walpole, a writer, decided he wanted his own “little Gothic castle.” In 1749, he built his estate in London, called Strawberry Hill, modeled off of Gothic cathedrals and medieval castles. Defined by arched windows, stained glass, turrets, and battlements, the residence is largely considered the first Gothic Revival building and contributed to the widespread re-interest in the historic aesthetic.</p><figure><p><span><p>Strawberry Hill House in west London</p>

Today, they are recognizable for their use of pointed arches (seen on doors, windows, and gables), high-pitched roofs, and vergeboard (wooden trim attached to gables).</p><p>Perhaps coincidentally, philosopher Edmund Burke published <em>A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</em> around this same time, in 1757, which became an extremely an influential text that detailed what he called sublime art. “Whatever is in any sort terrible or is conversant about terrible objects or operates in a manner analogous to terror, is a source of the sublime,” he wrote. Burke separated the beautiful from the sublime, and aesthetic theories generally classify the sublime as work that showcases greatness beyond measurement, comprehension, or experience; its magnitude is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><p>The interiors of Strawberry Hill</p>
</span><span>Sam Mellish/Getty Images</span></p></figure></div><p>Other important literature that was published during this time was work by Watpole himself. His novel, <em>Castle of Otranto,</em> was reportedly inspired by a dream he had while living at Strawberry Hill. Set in a castle in the Middle Ages, the epic details a lord and his family living in a haunted mansion. “In the late 18th and 19th century, Gothic became associated with spookiness, which got wound into ideas of the exotic and sublime,” Dr. Bork says. “By the 20th century, you have movies and mass media that start using this.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Today, filmmakers—and, more broadly, storytellers—use these ingrained historical associations to great effect. “When I teach my course, I approach architecture as a character in a film,” Crosbie says. “The character has a role, which is to get across and reinforce themes.” If the idea is to express something otherworldly or beyond comprehension—say, a ghost—what better style to use than Gothic? Of course, not every viewer will know its history, but, subconsciously, these messages may still come across.</p><p>Jennifer Spence, a production designer who has worked on movies such as <em>The Nun</em> (2018), <em>Splinter</em> (2008), and those in the <em>Insidious</em> (2013, 2015), <em>Paranormal Activity</em> (2010, 2011, 2012), and <em>Annabelle</em> (2017, 2019) franchises, notes that the style’s age is also compelling. “If you’re writing a story with a ghost, there has to be an origin,” she says. “An older home offers decades of opportunities for backstories to happen, maybe they got murdered or something else happened to them in the home.”</p><figure><p><span><p>An illustration of a neo-Gothic residence leans into horror motifs including bats, dead plants, and a seemingly abandoned home.</p>

</span><span>Photo: LMPC/Getty Images</span></p></figure></div><p>Dr. Bork points out film series like <em>Lord of the Rings,</em> in which the good kingdom, Gondor, is represented using motifs from Roman and Romanesque architecture, featuring round arches and simple proportions. On the other hand, Mordor, the evil kingdom, pulls from a Gothic vocabulary and includes pointed arches, pinnacles, and diagonal forms. “They were absolutely riffing on a well-informed knowledge of Romanesque and Gothic style when they put those films together,” he says. “And so, generations of kids have seen that by now and that colors their views.”</p><figure><p><span><p>A set in <em>Annabelle: Creation,</em> designed by Jennifer Spence</p>

Pictures and New Line Cinema</span></p></figure><p>Spence agrees that perceptions continue to play a role in the choice that set designers use today. “I remember looking back at some of the scary movies that I watched as a kid, like Vincent Price movies, and they were always in a Gothic house or some kind of castle. So you’re almost taught that they’re scary,” she says. “Now, it just seems like the kind of place a ghost or horror could be.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Though Gothic may have evolved from something heavenly to sinister, its original intentions remain. “It has flipped from light to dark, but what stays constant is the realization that it’s superhuman or unearthly,” Dr. Bork says. Today this may have a different effect, but “there’s a reason these things stick. It’s because they’re designed that way.”</p><figure></figure></div></div></div></div></div></div>
