Aboriginal people living in remote communities and town camps in the NT are not able to buy takeaway alcohol, although communities will be able to lift the bans if 60% of residents vote in favour of an alcohol management plan.</p><figure id="26b8a84a-11bf-466a-b28d-1d0d97b1c6df" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:3,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/04/we-have-to-come-together-alcohol-bans-alone-wont-fix-alice-springs-problems&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;‘We have to come together’: alcohol bans alone won’t fix Alice Springs’ problems&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;26b8a84a-11bf-466a-b28d-1d0d97b1c6df&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:0,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:0}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-3 | 3" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>NT police statistics collated by the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress revealed a 37% decrease in domestic violence assaults from January to April. All other assaults dropped 35% while property offences were down 25% over the same time period.</p><p>The People’s Alcohol Action Coalition, a community-based group aimed at raising awareness over alcohol-related harms and headed by the Alice Springs-based Dr John Boffa, said the renewed restrictions were having a positive impact.</p><ul>

</ul><p>The Central Australian Aboriginal Congress acting CEO, David Busuttil, said it had been tracking police data on crime and antisocial behaviour for many years, analysing trends and seeing the impacts of different legislation, including alcohol restrictions and policies.</p><p>“In the data, you can see the historical context, when different legislation or changes were made over time … we’ve been monitoring this for a long time because we think it’s one of the key social determinants of health and a key public health issue.”</p><p>He said the impact on domestic and family violence callouts was particularly stark: “Everyone deserves to be able to live safely. Domestic violence is a major issue all around Australia, but especially in the Northern Territory and Alice Springs.”</p><p>Boffa said the statistics showed alcohol restrictions were having a positive impact. “You can’t not notice it living in Alice Springs,” Boffa said.</p><p>“It’s incredibly noticeable, the change is in front of everyone’s faces … The town is a different place again … We’ve seen a big improvement because of alcohol restrictions but we can’t be complacent,” he said.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-12" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Boffa also cautioned that problems contributing to deep-rooted and complex issues should not be ignored.</p><p>“We’ve got to address poverty, inequality, unemployment, educational attainment, early childhood, trauma, the very things that we know make a big difference in terms of being able to live safely with alcohol but that will take time,” Boffa said.</p><p>Indigenous people and advocates have long warned restrictions and bans are not the solution, urging action on addressing drivers of harm such as poverty, a lack of education and employment opportunities, poor and overcrowded housing and family violence.</p><p>The federal government slated $250m in urgent funding to improve community safety and services, infrastructure, education, improved health access and community-led initiatives and programs.</p><p>“That money is starting to flow,” said Boffa, who is also the chief medical officer public health at the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress. “That’s made a big difference and everyone’s positive about it.”</p></div></div></div>
