    <h1>Principles of Distributed Computing (2016)</h1>

    <p>
Distributed computing is essential in modern computing and communications systems. 
Examples are on the one hand large-scale networks such as the Internet, and on the 
other hand multiprocessors such as your new multi-core laptop. The lecture notes on 
this webpage introduce the principles of distributed computing, emphasizing the 
fundamental issues underlying the design of distributed systems and networks: 
communication, coordination, fault-tolerance, locality, parallelism, self-organization, 
symmetry breaking, synchronization, uncertainty. We explore essential algorithmic ideas 
and lower bound techniques, basically the &#34;pearls&#34; of distributed computing. 
Each chapter covers a fresh topic.

    <p>
Note that the order of the chapters is more or less arbitrary. 
Each chapter is mostly independent, with the occasional reference to another chapter.
