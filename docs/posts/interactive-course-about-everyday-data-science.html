Average height, weight, intelligence? Averages are used to describe a population and are thereby applied frequently to individuals of that population. It can be dangerous to live by averages because what if you are an outlier? In health care especially, experts use well-tuned averages to make a diagnosis. But again, what if you are different?</span></span></p><p><span><span>In this chapter, we have a story of a man whose life was saved because he didn’t fit the average and spoke up.</span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div aria-hidden="false"><div><p><span>Coming soon</span></p><div><div><div><p aria-hidden="false"><h2><span><span>🆕 No, Garmin, I Didn&#39;t Die In My Sleep</span></span></h2></p><p aria-hidden="false"><h3><span><span>An Everyday Look at Imputation</span></span></h3></p><p><span><span>Our smartwatches track all kinds of useful metrics.

Here are some things people have said.</span></span></p><p><span><span>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Like Freakonomics, but Data Science. This is really fun! Lots of interesting case studies, got my brain running on personal data projects I could play around with.” </span></span><span><i>– Taylor Sorensen on Amazon.</i></span></p><p><span><span>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Andrew is easily one of the most productive people I&#39;ve worked with. His deep mathematics and machine learning knowledge make him incredibly valuable. Andrew led a machine learning business that I was a part of, and was instrumental in its success and acquisition.” </span></span><span><i>– Josh Greaves, Google Brain.</i></span></p><p><span><span>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Perfect for Data Science Younglings. Had fantastic examples of how you can apply data science to problems you might encounter. As someone who loves to ‘tinker’, it provides a great launching point for trying out data science in your own life in a reasonable and very useful way. Would recommend 10/10.” </span></span><span><i>– PH on Amazon.</i></span></p><p><span><span>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Andrew not only has brilliant ideas, but understands how to communicate those ideas to others in a way that gets them excited. Many of his ideas are brilliantly simple concepts that take a lot of talent and hard work to create.” </span></span><span><i>– Andrew W. Daniels.</i></span></p><p><span><span>​​⭐ “There is a serious lack of any editing, to the point that certain chapters are a SINGLE WORD.” </span></span><span><i>– Sangwhan Moon on Amazon, who apparently really hated that joke chapter.</i></span></p><p><span><span>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Andrew is the go-to guy for understanding the math and statistics behind state of the art machine learning.” </span></span><span><i>– Joshua Mathias.</i></span></p><p><span><span>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Andrew is a humble guy. He’s not the sort to add a wall of quotes to this page. I made him do it.” </span></span><span><i>– Jim Fisher, TigYog.</i></span></p><p aria-hidden="false"><h2><span><b>👋 Hi, I’m Andrew.

You should know what functions are in both math and programming. You should have some basic knowledge of stats, and a bit of experience with calculus concepts like derivatives (although I do some refreshers along the way).</span></span></p><p><span><span>But the most important prerequisite is a desire to work with data. Everything else you can figure out as you go. And I&#39;m always open to 1-1 emails and chats if you get stuck or want to go deeper! 🙂</span></span></p><p><span><b>“What is Data Science?”</b></span><span><span> Data Science is making decisions with data. It&#39;s not a magic cure-all, but it might help you optimize your life. If you take this course, you’ll see many fun case studies where you can use data in </span></span><span><i>everyday </i></span><span><span>situations, with some interesting math and tricks.</span></span></p><p><span><b>“How is Data Science?”</b></span><span><span> Don’t you mean, “How is Data Science </span></span><span><i>done</i></span><span><span>?” Well, you’ll find out in this course by doing some! But here’s an example. Why hasn&#39;t there been a new </span></span><span><i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i></span><span><span> movie recently? 🏴‍☠️ I had a theory: you only make a sequel if the last movie was well-received. I plotted their Rotten Tomatoes scores:</span></span></p><div aria-hidden="false"><p><img src="https://tigyog.app/api/files/661bdba57d2be07fd6621e5a1cf4ff1023b4dad386b70d3d64a4658cb6884201.png" alt="Source: Rotten Tomatoes."/></p></div><p><span><span>Imagine you’re in charge of giving the green light for another sequel. Now you’ve seen this graph, what would </span></span><span><i>you </i></span><span><span>do? If you said “reject the sequel”, you might want to do some </span></span><span><i>more </i></span><span><span>data science, because the </span></span><span><i>profit </i></span><span><span>per film tells a slightly different story! 💸 We’ll see in this course that asking the right question is critical!</span></span></p><p><span><b>“Why is Data Science?”</b></span><span><span> More than half of all organizations suffer from data illiteracy. People in the organization don’t understand what the data means, or how to use it to make decisions. And the decision makers – managers and company leaders – are even </span></span><span><i>less</i></span><span><span> likely to be data literate!</span></span></p><p><span><b>“Who is Data Science?” </b></span><span><span>You! This course is for you!</span></span></p><p><span><b>“When is Data Science?”</b></span><span><span> Every day</span></span></p><p><span><b>“What if I don’t like the course?” </b></span><span><span>Then … you don’t have to buy it. But if you buy it and </span></span><span><i>then</i></span><span><span> you don’t like it, you can get a refund, no questions asked 🙂</span></span></p><p><span><b>“What the frick is TigYog?” </b></span><span><span>TigYog lets anyone write interactive courses just like this one! Everyday Data Science is the first flagship course on TigYog. But you could write the next one! </span></span><a href="https://tigyog.app" target="_blank"><span><span>Learn more.</span></span></a><span><span></span></span></p><p><span><b>“You didn’t cover my favorite algorithm!” </b></span><span><span>That’s not a question, and this course is not a textbook. 📚 It’s a collection of interesting tales. 📜 But they might inspire you to pick up a textbook afterwards – reach out and I&#39;ll give you my top recommendations!</span></span></p><p><span><b>“Will content be updated continuously?” </b></span><span><span>I will be publishing ten chapters eventually. The topics are mostly timeless, so I don’t plan to update it after that. The jokes and cultural references will gracefully go stale.</span></span></p><p><span><b>“I’m stuck; where can I go for help?” </b></span><span><span>Don’t feel bad about making a guess if you have to! If something is still unclear, </span></span><a href="https://twitter.com/andrew_n_carr" target="_blank"><span><span>reach out to me on Twitter</span></span></a><span><span>, and I’ll try to make it right.</span></span></p></div></article></div></div>
