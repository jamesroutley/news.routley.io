The email noted that the company receives around 10,000 reports of sextortion </span><em>each month</em><span>—and that figure is likely “only a fraction of the total abuse occurring on the platform.”</span></p><p><span>This statistic prompted us to investigate what else Snap Inc. knows or believes about the impact of its product on users, particularly teens (We </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dnCPs5kGeba0Jy2fLCiUvSuCaM-TNyeOpIM-NAlIDtA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="">estimate</a><span> that roughly 13 million American 13-17 year-olds use Snapchat). Over the past several months, we have examined multiple court cases filed against Snap Inc., many involving severe or fatal harm that was (allegedly) facilitated by Snapchat’s features. From 2022 through 2025, as part of the Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) and Judicial Council Coordinated Proceedings (JCCP) against social media defendants, more than 600</span><span> such lawsuits specifically named Snap Inc. as a defendant. In addition, state attorneys general from </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/uy4cwaov493wfdg5bwmri/Nevada.v.Snap.ANNOTATED.pdf?rlkey=m91ineg3swze2k1fv47ravo9z&amp;st=0p0yee58&amp;dl=0" rel="">Nevada</a><span> and </span><a href="https://nmdoj.gov/press-release/31302/" rel="">New Mexico</a><span> have brought significant cases against the company—two cases which we will draw heavily from in this post.</span></p><p><span>Following the format of our previous post about the </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/industrial-scale-harm-tiktok" rel="">“industrial scale harms” attributed to TikTok</a><span>, this piece presents dozens of quotations from internal reports, studies, memos, conversations, and public statements in which Snap executives, employees, and consultants acknowledge and discuss the harms that Snapchat causes to many minors who use their platform. We group these findings into five key clusters of harms:</span></p><ol><li><p>Addictive, Compulsive, and Problematic Use</p></li><li><p>Drugs and Guns</p></li><li><p>Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), Sextortion, and In-person Sexual Predation and Assault</p></li><li><p>Cyberbullying</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of Harm and Underage Use, and Lack of Action</p></li></ol><p>Similar to TikTok, we show that company insiders were aware of multiple widespread and serious harms, and in many cases did not act promptly or make substantial changes. As Snap’s director of security engineering said regarding Android users who are selling drugs or child sexual abuse material on Snap:</p><blockquote><p><strong>“That’s fine it’s been broken for ten years we can tolerate tonight.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>With regard to sextortion on the platform, one employee had complained in a private channel:</p><blockquote><p><strong>“God I’m so pissed that were over-run by this sextortion shit right now. We’ve twiddled our thumbs and wrung our hands all f…ing year.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>The briefs allege that the company is also aware of rampant underage use, and of the ineffectiveness of their age gating process. Snap executives have admitted that Snapchat’s age verification system</p><blockquote><p><strong>“Is effectively useless in stopping underage users from signing up to the Snapchat app.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>Although the evidence below is all publicly available, no one has compiled and combined direct quotations from company insiders and internal reports across multiple alleged harms. We think this compilation gives vital information to parents, who might want some insight into the business practices of a company that hosts their children’s social lives, owns much of their attention, and influences their social development.</p><p>At the start of each section, we highlight a real-life example—drawn from relevant court documents—illustrating the specific harm in question. Each child’s story offers a human perspective on the broader statistics and quotations that reveal the far-reaching harms discussed within the company.</p><p>While working on this post we had four conversations with Snap’s leaders and employees during which we asked them about some of the harms that appear in the various briefs. In three of those meetings, we asked specifically about the claim, taken from an internal Snap email that was quoted in the New Mexico brief, that Snap gets 10,000 reports of sextortion each month. We did not get any rebuttals or explanations of that claim.</p><p><span>Snap’s Trust and Safety team made a point that we think is valid and important for readers to keep in mind: the briefs we are drawing from present the allegations of one side in litigation, and there is often another side. Some of the quotations may have been misinterpreted or taken out of context. Snap’s Trust and Safety team pointed us to a </span><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/kw9k15zxztrs/6E4AaHCuTqmZ08tsZ4Hzrx/d05c53da483df701db628442c4b06fc1/Motion_to_dismiss.pdf" rel="">motion</a><span> Snap made to have the New Mexico case dismissed. We read that brief and found that it contested only a few of the many claims made in the New Mexico brief. Two of these claims had been in our list of quotations, so we cut one from the post below, and we added a comment to the other.</span></p><p><span>Snap’s Trust and Safety team also shared various measures they take to mitigate harm to children and teenagers. The Trust and Safety team said that child safety is their top priority and they told us that they proactively remove significant amounts of harmful content. In Snap’s </span><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/kw9k15zxztrs/6E4AaHCuTqmZ08tsZ4Hzrx/d05c53da483df701db628442c4b06fc1/Motion_to_dismiss.pdf" rel="">motion to dismiss</a><span> they state that Snap has “doubled the size of its Trust and Safety team and tripled the size of its Law Enforcement Operations team since 2020” which has “improved Snap’s ability to act quickly when Snapchat users report harassment or improper sexual content on the platform.”</span></p><p><span>We have no doubt that Snap does remove large quantities of harmful content from its platform, or that they are trying to remove even more. However, it is difficult to assess whether Snap is solving 5% or 75% or 99% of the problem since its metrics focus on the number of pieces of content removed rather than the percentage of Snapchat users who experience harm on the platform. Even if Snap were to remove a billion pieces of drug or sex related content each year, many teen users may still encounter such content every day. And any teen who wants to buy drugs may still find it easy to find dealers, as has happened in many </span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/inside-snapchat-teenage-opioid-crisis-1235036691/" rel="">tragic cases </a><span>of fentanyl poisoning, including </span><a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/olympia/olympia-teen-overdose-death-warning-social-media-drug-deals/281-5bcd5b4a-dd81-4184-833c-f5d6e0f2139e" rel="">very recent cases</a><span>. Many may still report seeing sexual content, as there are many ways for users to be sexually explicit without violating policies.</span></p><p><span>From a parent&#39;s</span><strong> </strong><span>perspective: if you were choosing which summer camp to send your teen to, would it be reassuring to learn that a camp used to remove 100 sharks a month from its coastal swimming area, but now they remove 500 a month? Probably not reassuring at all. As a parent, you’d much prefer a camp that put its resources into prevention—such as by putting an effective shark barrier around the swimming area—rather than one that focused on catching sharks more quickly after campers report seeing their fins.</span></p><p>We also had the opportunity to discuss many of our observations about Snapchat’s features with both their leadership and their trust and safety teams. We appreciated their willingness to engage with us. We suggested to them some design changes that we believe would make the platform less addictive and less harmful:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Remove the Quick Add feature</strong><strong> for minors</strong><span>, which is one of the main ways that adult predators and drug dealers get access to teens.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Remove the streaks feature</strong><span>,</span><span> which causes many teens to send photos to each other compulsively, needlessly increasing their time on the app. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Remove beauty filters for minors</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Remove engagement-based algorithms,</strong><span> at the very least, for underage users.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Stop deleting posts on Snap’s own servers.</strong><span> The fact that Snap does not store the content of conversations (beyond a limited period) is helpful for drug dealers, sextortionists, and others with criminal intent, but it does not improve the user experience of most children to know that even if something goes terribly wrong, their conversations cannot be discovered by law enforcement officers.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Do a lot more to remove underage users.</strong><span> Snap is widely used in middle schools. (A 2021 </span><a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/8-18-census-integrated-report-final-web_0.pdf" rel="">survey by Common Sense Media</a><span> reported that 13% of 8 to 12 year olds said they had “ever used” Snapchat. We therefore </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dnCPs5kGeba0Jy2fLCiUvSuCaM-TNyeOpIM-NAlIDtA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9c6hafvrg85p" rel="">estimate</a><span> that in 2021 in the U.S., about 2.7 million children ages 8 to 12 had used Snapchat.)</span></p></li></ol><p><span>One broader request we made was to collaborate on publicly accessible user experience research that could help quantify and reduce the harms we describe below. It would be important to know precisely what percentage of kids receive unwanted advances on their platform, or know how to access drugs - which are very different questions from the ones that they generally answer publicly. Such assessments have been called for by </span><a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2023-11-07_-_testimony_-_bejar.pdf" rel="">company whistleblowers</a><span> and </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10458" rel="">public health experts</a><span>.</span></p><p>We remain hopeful that Snap will act on some of these requests. Nonetheless, we decided to move forward with this post because whatever safety improvements have been made in recent years, and whatever improvements Snap says it will make in the future, we believe it remains essential for the public to understand the dangers associated with Snapchat, as expressed by Snap’s own employees and consultants, who are quoted in numerous court documents that have emerged in recent years.</p><p><span>While the company has clearly made efforts to address some of these concerns, transparency about their past actions and insider beliefs about the platform&#39;s impact are critical for those of us trying to understand: how did we get here? What on earth happened in the early 2010s such that there is now an </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/global-youth-mental-health" rel="">international</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/international-mental-illness-part-one" rel="">youth mental health crisis</a><span>, increasing evidence of </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8016c64-63b7-458b-a371-e0e1c54a13fc" rel="">attentional fragmentation</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/12/cell-phones-student-test-scores-dropping/676889/" rel="">declining functional intelligence</a><span>, and countless cases of severe harm—from fentanyl-laced drugs bought on Snapchat to suicide after sextortion that began on their platform.</span></p><p><span>The quotations we give below indicate that the harms that occur on Snapchat (as with </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/industrial-scale-harm-tiktok" rel="">TikTok</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/instagram-facebook-teens-harassment-safety-5d991be1" rel="">Instagram</a><span>) are so vast that </span><em>even</em><span> a highly dedicated trust and safety team that removes hundreds of millions of pieces of harmful content cannot prevent millions of children from being exposed to serious harms on their platform. This is why design changes are so urgently needed. Better content moderation is not enough.</span></p><p>Here’s a simple way to determine whether an online platform is safe for kids: Does it connect children to anonymous unverified adult strangers? If so, then a great variety of harms are likely to ensue, and parents should be wary of letting their children use that platform until the company makes very substantial design changes.</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/industrial-scale-snapchat?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/industrial-scale-snapchat?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>We draw primarily from Attorney General Raul Torrez of New Mexico who released a 165 page narrowly redacted complaint against Snap Inc. on October 2, 2024.

Snap P. 117-124, PARA 481-517: Jack McCarthy got his first phone at 12 years old, and opened a Snapchat account without his parents’ knowledge or consent. Jack’s use of Snapchat “coincided with a steady decline in his mental health.” Jack became “locked into Snap’s social media product, as intended, causing him to feel like he couldn’t sleep without it.” When his parents tried to limit his access to Snapchat, Jack “became agitated… He would become visibly panicked and irrational, willing to do and say anything to get his device back.” Although Jack’s sleep and anxiety worsened, he would claim his “insomnia” would be made worse if his phone was not at his side. After years of Jack’s declining mental health and increasing dependence on the Snap platform, Jack obtained drugs through an anonymous dealer on Snapchat who had added him through Snap’s Quick Add and mapping features.

After Carson ended his life, two psychologists who provided care to Carson and his family opined that Carson’s suicide was triggered by cyberbullying.”</p><p>“Upon information and belief, from January 23, 2020 to June 22, 2020, Carson received 105 messages via YOLO… of the 105 anonymous messages Carson received via YOLO, 62 messages included content that was meant to humiliate him, often involving sexually explicit and disturbing content.”</p><p>Through Carson’s internet search history, investigators concluded that Carson made multiple attempts to reveal the identities of the bullies. “Carson relied on YOLO’s misrepresentations that it would reveal the identities of aggressors” on their platform. Snap also failed to deliver on its statements that “it would remove any third party apps that allow bullying and harassing behavior on its platform.”</p><p>“On the first screen of the user’s interface with the app, YOLO states, ‘No bullying. If you send harassing messages to our users, your identity will be revealed.’” The lack of follow through on this statement is seen in Carson&#39;s internet search history of items such as “YOLO Identity Reveal”, and multiple in-app attempts to have abusers “‘S/U’ (Swipe Up) to reveal their identities”, with no results. And as further evidenced in Carson’s final attempt to find out who was sending abusive YOLO messages to him, on the morning of his suicide, Carson’s final phone search was “Reveal YOLO Username Online.”</p><p><em><span>[[You can read an essay from Carson’s mother, Kristin, about her story and her experience dealing with Snap Inc. </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/keeping-our-kids-safe-online" rel="">here</a><span>.]]</span></em></p><p>                                 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.          </p><ul><li><p>NM P. 60-61, PARA 136</p><ul><li><p><span>Snap&#39;s own research demonstrated that ephemerality was directly connected to parental concerns about the safety of their children.

A UK report from March 2023 supports this proposition. Ahead of Britain’s planned Online Safety Bill, TikTok and Snapchat were asked how many suspected users under the age of 13 they had removed from their platform in a year. TikTok reported that between April 2021 and 2022 it had blocked an average of around 180,000 suspected underage accounts in Britain alone every month (totaling around 2 million, in Britain, for a 12-month period). For this same period of time, “Snapchat had disclosed that it had removed approximately 60 accounts per month, or just over 700 total.” A source within Snapchat acknowledged that “</span><strong>It makes no sense that Snapchat is blocking a fraction of the number of children that TikTok is.</strong><span>”</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><p><span>Snapchat has been running an advertising campaign with </span><a href="https://www.moresnapchat.com/" rel="">the theme</a><span> “Less social media.

But as multiple legal briefs and hundreds of quotations have shown, design choices made long ago and more recently have turned the platform into something that shares a lot with Instagram and TikTok. In addition, Snapchat’s unique combination of quick-add, disappearing messages, Snapmap, and no record of the content of conversations makes Snapchat particularly well suited for ill-intentioned adults who want to interact with or sell things to children.</p><p><span>As Sarah Wynn-Williams </span><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250391230/carelesspeople/" rel="">recently said</a><span> about Meta, “It didn’t have to be this way.” The same is true for Snapchat. As we have suggested in this post, </span><em>Snap could fix many of these problems quickly </em><span>if</span><strong> </strong><span>they were to make the platform less addictive to children and less inviting for criminal activity. For example, they could:</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>Work harder to identify underage users and remove them from the platform.</strong><span> At present, at least several million children in the U.S. alone who are under 13 have Snapchat accounts. Social media companies </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/scott-galloway-explains-why-age-gating" rel="">could age-gate</a><span> in a variety of ways if they wanted to.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Remove the Quick Add feature,</strong><span> which is one of the main ways that adult predators and drug dealers get access to children and teens.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Remove the streaks feature,</strong><span> which leads many teens to send photos to each other compulsively, needlessly increasing their time on the app. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Remove beauty filters for minors.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Remove engagement-based algorithms,</strong><span> at the very least, for minors.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Stop deleting posts on Snap’s own servers.</strong><span> The fact that Snap does not store the content of conversations (beyond a limited period) is helpful for drug dealers, sextortionists, and others with criminal intent, but it does not improve the user experience for most children to know that even if something goes terribly wrong, their conversations cannot be discovered by law enforcement officers.</span></p></li></ol><p>We understand that it is very difficult to run a platform used by hundreds of millions of people in many countries. But if you operate a platform that is central to the lives of children, including millions of 10-12 year olds, then you have a moral responsibility to make design choices for their benefit, even if those changes reduce engagement and revenue. You can’t just pull more sharks out of the water. You have to put up a shark barrier, no matter the cost.</p><p>We are grateful that Snapchat has been willing to engage with us, and we recognize that their Trust and Safety team is working hard in a difficult and ever-changing environment. We hope to continue our conversation with them, and we hope to write about the platform in the future with news of major improvements.</p><p><span>But in the meantime, we believe that the quotations we have presented—from Snap’s leaders, employees, and consultants—provides strong evidence for parents and legislators to take action on our second of four norms</span><span> for rolling back the phone-based childhood: </span><em>No social media before 16</em><span>.</span></p></div></div></div>
