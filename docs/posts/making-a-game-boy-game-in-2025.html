<p>I recently developed a custom Game Boy game, flashed it onto physical cartridges, and sold them at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOhHMcHjRMa/?img_index=1">a local makers festival</a>.
The whole process was surprisingly straight-forward, and I think more professional developers should give it a try.
As a career-long software guy, it felt rewarding to exchange real money for a tangible good.</p>

<p>My game, Hot Dog Race, is based on the 4th-inning show at Baltimore Oriole’s home games.
Many baseball stadiums have something similar: the crowd cheers for their favorite character as they do a quick and silly sideline race.
The Game Boy game is just as simple.
The player picks a condiment, and then runs around the bases trying to be the first hot dog to reach home plate.</p>

<p>I developed the game in <a href="https://www.gbstudio.dev">GB Studio</a> which is the simplest option for a first time game designer.
In the future, it’d be fun to try the C-based <a href="https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020">GBDK</a>, but I ignored my inner tinkerer here for the sake of finishing the project.
The built-in GB Studio engines are solid and include the batteries needed to make a professional game.
All in all, I spent more time on the art design than I did the game logic, which is a testament to how comprehensive GB Studio is.</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://piskelapp.com">Piskel</a> to hand-draw all of my sprites.
Sometimes I could start with a scaled down PNG, like on the character select screen which uses designs by my friend at <a href="http://makemore410.com">Makemore</a>.
However, I ended up needing to manually paint pixels in every graphic at some point.
The game’s music is from <a href="https://tiptoptomcat.itch.io/8-bit-gameboy-songs-dx-gb-studio">TipTopTomCat’s 8-bit collection</a>.</p>

<p>Getting the game onto physical media was also pretty easy.
I used <a href="https://handheldlegend.com/products/game-boy-flash-cartridge-512kb-rom-ferrante-crafts">512KB Ferrante Crafts cartridges</a>, which turned out to be larger than I needed.
Apparently, it’s cheapest to buy game reproductions (like Pokemon Crystal) from AliExpress and overwrite them, but this felt another time to ignore the tinkerer.
GB Studio exports <code>.gbc</code> ROMs, which I loaded onto the empty cartridges using a <a href="https://www.gbxcart.com">GBxCart RW</a>, which works with the open-source <a href="https://github.com/lesserkuma/FlashGBX">FlashGBX</a> program.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://kofi.sexy/gameboy">play Hot Dog Race online</a> and even buy a cartridge while supply lasts!
My GB Studio project is <a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/hot-dog-race">available on GitHub</a> should you want to give Game Boy dev a try yourself.</p>
