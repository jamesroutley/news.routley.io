    <h1>Launch HN: Twenty.com (YC S23) – Open-source CRM</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello HN,</p><p>Seven years ago, I complained about Salesforce on HN. Somebody said: &#34;one day, someone will do better&#34;. That stuck and today we&#39;re trying to be that “someone” with my co-founders Thomas (design) and Charles (eng like me). Our company is called Twenty and our repo is here: <a href="https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty">https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty</a></p><p>We want to fix two issues: most CRMs aren&#39;t enjoyable to use and they often clash with engineering teams.</p><p>YC encouraged us to launch early. What you see now is about two months&#39; worth of feature development. Our tool only does a small part of what big CRM players offer, but we focused on providing a great user experience on the basics, instead of spreading ourselves thin across a vast range of features and delivering them half-heartedly. Plus, we&#39;ve found that many small companies like the product as it is because they don&#39;t need all the complex stuff.</p><p>Once we have covered the basics, we’ll soon be working on three big features: - Moving to a robust metadata-driven architecture; - Providing innovating ways to extend the CRM with Typescript; - Making it easy to connect data sources, and fetch data in real-time like in BI tools.</p><p>The startup world is littered with ghosts of so-called &#34;Salesforce killers&#34;, so we know it sounds naive to pitch ourselves in a similar way. But we think that if someone ends up changing this market, it will most likely be through a community-led effort. And there hasn’t really been any serious attempt to start a great new open source CRM in the last decade.</p><p>Twenty is built with Typescript, React, and NestJS with GraphQL, and licensed under AGPL. We plan to make money by offering a hosted version. Our docs are here: <a href="https://docs.twenty.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.twenty.com</a>. Try on cloud: <a href="https://app.twenty.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://app.twenty.com</a>.</p><p>Dev setup and demo: <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/7b20b44d8d5146fea8923183511bb818" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.loom.com/share/7b20b44d8d5146fea8923183511bb818</a> (Loom said they couldn’t provide a transcript because they don’t support “language other than english” haha... apologies in advance!)</p><p>We’re very eager to get your feedback as we haven’t launched anywhere before this post. What&#39;s your CRM story? What should we prioritize next?</p></div></div></div>
