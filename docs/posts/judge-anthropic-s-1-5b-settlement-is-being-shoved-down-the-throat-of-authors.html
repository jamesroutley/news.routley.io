<p>At a hearing Monday, US District Judge William Alsup blasted a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/first-of-its-kind-ai-settlement-anthropic-to-pay-authors-1-5-billion/">proposed $1.5 billion settlement</a> over Anthropic&#39;s rampant piracy of books to train AI.</p>
<p>The proposed settlement comes in a case where Anthropic could have owed <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-settles-copyright-lawsuit-authors/">more than $1 trillion</a> in damages after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/ai-industry-horrified-to-face-largest-copyright-class-action-ever-certified/">Alsup certified a class</a> that included up to 7 million claimants whose works were illegally downloaded by the AI company.</p>
<p>Instead, critics fear Anthropic will get off cheaply, striking a deal with authors suing that covers less than 500,000 works and paying a small fraction of its total valuation (currently <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation">$183 billion</a>) to get away with the massive theft. Defector <a href="https://defector.com/if-the-thieving-ai-company-can-survive-the-legal-settlement-then-it-is-not-big-enough">noted</a> that the settlement doesn&#39;t even require Anthropic to admit wrongdoing, while the company continues raising billions based on models trained on authors&#39; works. Most recently, Anthropic raised $13 billion in a funding round, making back about 10 times the proposed settlement amount after announcing the deal.</p>
<p>Alsup expressed grave concerns that lawyers rushed the deal, which he said now risks being shoved &#34;down the throat of authors,&#34; Bloomberg Law <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/anthropic-judge-blasts-copyright-pact-as-nowhere-close-to-done">reported</a>.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bartz-v-Anthropic-Order-RE-Hearing-on-Motion-for-Preliminary-Approval-of-Settlement-9-7-25.pdf">order</a>, Alsup clarified why he thought the proposed settlement was a chaotic mess. The judge said he was &#34;disappointed that counsel have left important questions to be answered in the future,&#34; seeking approval for the settlement despite the Works List, the Class List, the Claim Form, and the process for notification, allocation, and dispute resolution all remaining unresolved.</p>
<p>Denying preliminary approval of the settlement, Alsup suggested that the agreement is &#34;nowhere close to complete,&#34; forcing Anthropic and authors&#39; lawyers to &#34;recalibrate&#34; the largest publicly reported copyright class-action settlement ever inked, Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p>Of particular concern, the settlement failed to outline how disbursements would be managed for works with multiple claimants, Alsup noted. Until all these details are ironed out, Alsup intends to withhold approval, the order said.</p>
<p>One big change the judge wants to see is the addition of instructions requiring &#34;anyone with copyright ownership&#34; to opt in, with the consequence that the work won&#39;t be covered if even one rights holder opts out, Bloomberg reported. There should also be instruction that any disputes over ownership or submitted claims should be settled in state court, Alsup said.</p>
