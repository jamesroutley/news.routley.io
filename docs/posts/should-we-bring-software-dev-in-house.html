    <h1>Ask HN: Should we bring software dev in-house?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m an executive at a mid-sized logistics company (~200 employees, $200-300M annual revenue) getting more and more frustrated with our software situation and am considering taking software development in-house. I&#39;ve been lurking here for years, so looking at the HN community to talk me out of it.</p><p>We&#39;re using a third-party product that functions, but barely. The provider is understaffed and unresponsive and the platform is stagnant. It&#39;s a fight getting basic bugs fixed let alone new features implemented. 
We&#39;re having to resort to a separate low-code platform to fill in the gaps. 
Our business operates in a specific niche and there are no other providers who cater specifically to our industry.</p><p>As we are growing we&#39;re running in to the limits of what this product can offer. We&#39;re being hampered in our speed of execution and missing crucial insights. I feel like we could do much better with a product catered specifically to us.</p><p>On the other hand, while our current solution seems like a straightforward CRUD app, I fear the devil is in the details. Will we get stuck at 80% completion? We do a lot of data exchange via EDIFACT, for instance, with various government institutions all over Europe. This feels like a quagmire in which development can quickly stall.</p><p>Besides, can we even attract experienced developers to a non-glamorous industry like logistics?</p><p>We&#39;d particularly appreciate input on:</p><p>Strategies for attracting and retaining tech talent in a non-tech industry
Experiences transitioning from third-party to in-house software (success stories and cautionary tales).
Potential pitfalls we might not be considering.
Alternative solutions we should explore.</p><p>Has anyone here navigated a similar transition? What worked? What didn&#39;t? Any advice would be appreciated.</p></div></div></div>
