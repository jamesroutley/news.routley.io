It took the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s (SOI) research vessel <em>Falkor (too)</em> 30 days to complete its <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/cruise/underworld-of-hydrothermal-vents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expedition</a>, and brought home one of the biggest discoveries in 46 years of studying hydrothermal vents.</p><p>Here, on the East Pacific Rise, an underwater robot was able to turn over sections of volcanic crust to reveal a new-to-science ecosystem teeming with worms, snails, and chemosynthetic bacteria that are seemingly thriving despite living in 25°C (75°F) water. It changes the way we now view hydrothermal vents, adding a whole new dimension with ecosystems existing both on their surface and underneath.</p><p>“On land, we have long known of animals living in caves underground, and in the ocean of animals living in sand and mud, but for the first time, scientists have looked beneath hydrothermal vents,” said SOI’s Executive Director, Dr Jyotika Virmani, in a statement sent to IFlScience. “This truly remarkable discovery of a new ecosystem, hidden beneath another ecosystem, provides fresh evidence that life exists in incredible places.”</p><div data-asset-id="69873" data-reactroot=""><div><picture title=""><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69873/hydrothermal-vent-life-l.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69873/hydrothermal-vent-life-l.png" type="image/png"/><source media="(min-width: 568px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69873/hydrothermal-vent-life-m.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width: 568px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69873/hydrothermal-vent-life-m.png" type="image/png"/><source media="(max-width: 567px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69873/hydrothermal-vent-life-s.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(max-width: 567px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69873/hydrothermal-vent-life-s.png" type="image/png"/><img data-asset-id="69873" src="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69873/new ecosystem beneath hydrothermal vents.png" alt="hydrothermal vent life" title="hydrothermal vent life" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><p>The underside of a section of volcanic crust reveals some of the species living under the surface of hydrothermal vents.</p><p>Image credit: Mónika Naranjo-Shepherd / Schmidt Ocean Institute, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CC BY-NC-SA</a></p></figcaption></div><p><a href="https://www.iflscience.com/three-new-hydrothermal-vents-found-and-theyre-shrimply-stunning-68217" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New hydrothermal vents</a> can appear when tectonic activity sees the plates on Earth’s crust shift and crack. These cracks fill with seawater that gets heated by the magma, making it rise back to the seafloor.</p><p>We’ve long understood how new hydrothermal vents appear, but what had people scratching their heads was how the ecosystems that live on them emerge so rapidly. One of the foundational animals of these ecosystems is the tubeworm, but we’ve rarely found its young on hydrothermal vent surfaces.</p><p>This new and pivotal discovery about how tubeworms can travel beneath the hydrothermal vent surface goes some way to explaining how they colonize new habitats. They were able to reach their conclusions with the aid of the underwater robot, ROV SuBastian, which glued boxes over cracks in the Earth’s crust and was able to collect some of the animals living below the surface.</p><div data-asset-id="69872" data-reactroot=""><div><picture title=""><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69872/life-beneath-hydrothermal-vents-l.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69872/life-beneath-hydrothermal-vents-l.png" type="image/png"/><source media="(min-width: 568px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69872/life-beneath-hydrothermal-vents-m.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width: 568px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69872/life-beneath-hydrothermal-vents-m.png" type="image/png"/><source media="(max-width: 567px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69872/life-beneath-hydrothermal-vents-s.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(max-width: 567px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69872/life-beneath-hydrothermal-vents-s.png" type="image/png"/><img data-asset-id="69872" src="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/70178/iImg/69872/sample deep sea vent tubeworms.png" alt="life beneath hydrothermal vents" title="life beneath hydrothermal vents" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><p>Experiments code-named &#34;Mesh Box Staining Gadgets&#34; were sealed to the seafloor at the Tica Vent to see what, if any, life was beneath.</p><p>Image credit: ROV SuBastian / Schmidt Ocean Institute,<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> CC BY-NC-SA</a></p></figcaption></div><p>The discovery of a new ecosystem is always an exciting one, but it also represents a new consideration in the ongoing debate over the safety of deep-sea mining.
