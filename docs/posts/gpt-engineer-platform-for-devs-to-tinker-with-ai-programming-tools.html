    <h1>Show HN: gpt-engineer – platform for devs to tinker with AI programming tools</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello Hacker News community,</p><p>Wanted to share a project I started working on during my spare time and was then discovered by many in the open source community last week.</p><p>GPT Engineer’s mission:
Be the open platform for devs to tinker with and build their personal code-generation toolbox.</p><p>I believe it&#39;s key for us devs to engage in how building software can and will change.</p><p>You can find more info about the flexible technical &#34;philosophy&#34; to make it work well, and the community we want it to become on github:
https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer</p><p>The project is still in early stages. It&#39;s clear that there is a lot of room for improvement as the space to combine tricks that guide LLM&#39;s is large.</p><p>Appreciate any suggestions, experiences, or ideas on the project from you all!</p></div></div></div>
