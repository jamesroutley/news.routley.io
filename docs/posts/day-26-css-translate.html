<h4>What I Did</h4>



<ul>
<li>Wrote RC Niceties</li>



<li>Chatted on Jobs Chat</li>



<li>Worked on <a href="https://github.com/jamiepalatnik/slow-art-online">Slow Art Online</a></li>
</ul>



<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Niceties are a Recurse Center tradition, a chance to write messages to people wrapping up their batch. Writing some up also gave me a chance to appreciate all the connections I’ve made during my own batch so far and how much I’m going to miss people that are finishing their batch! The Recurse Center encourages participants to <a href="https://www.recurse.com/about">never graduate</a>—you can still stay involved in the community even after your batch—so here’s hoping our paths will cross again.</li>



<li>Had a fun impromptu pairing session/design workshop on Slow Art Online w/ <a href="https://www.drivehome.design/">Daniel</a>.</li>



<li>TIL CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/translate"><code>translate()</code></a>—now the side panel on Slow Art Online slides in from offscreen without changing its width the way it did in my previous approach. This looks much nicer since you don’t have the side panel elements rearranging themselves to adjust to the quickly changing width. They stay in place instead.</li>
</ul>
