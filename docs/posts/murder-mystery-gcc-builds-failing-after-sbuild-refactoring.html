    <h1>Murder Mystery: GCC builds failing after sbuild refactoring</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is the story of an investigation conducted by Jochen Sprickerhof, Helmut
Grohne, and myself. It was true teamwork, and we would have not reached the
bottom of the issue working individually. We think you will find it as
interesting and fun as we did, so here is a brief writeup. A few of the steps
mentioned here took several days, others just a few minutes. What is described
as a natural progression of events did not always look very obvious at the
moment at all.</p>
<p>Let us go through the Six Stages of Debugging together.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_stage_1_that_cannot_happen">Stage 1: That cannot happen</h2>
<div>
<p>Official Debian GCC builds start failing on multiple architectures in late
November.</p>
<p>The build error happens on the build servers when running the testuite, but we
know this cannot happen. GCC builds are not meant to fail in case of testsuite
failures!  Return codes are not making the build fail, <code>make</code> is being called
with <code>-k</code>, it just cannot happen.</p>
<p>A <strong>lot</strong> of the GCC tests are always failing in fact, and an extensive log of
the results is posted to <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-gcc/">the debian-gcc
mailing list</a>, but the packages always build fine regardless.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_stage_2_that_does_not_happen_on_my_machine">Stage 2: That does not happen on my machine</h2>
<div>
<p>Building on my machine running Bookworm is just fine. The Build Daemons run
Bookworm and use a Sid chroot for the build environment, just like I am. Same
kernel.</p>

<p>The only obvious difference between my setup and the Debian buildds is that I
am using sbuild <strong>0.85.0</strong> from bookworm, and the buildds have <strong>0.86.3~bpo12+1</strong>
from bookworm-backports. Trying again with <strong>0.86.3~bpo12+1</strong>, the build fails on
my system too. The build daemons were updated to the bookworm-backports version
of sbuild at some point in late November. Ha.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_stage_3_that_should_not_happen">Stage 3: That should not happen</h2>
<div>
<p>There are quite a few sbuild versions in between 0.85.0  and 0.86.3~bpo12+1,
but looking at recent sbuild bugs shows that
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1084956">sbuild 0.86.0 was
breaking &#34;quite a number of packages&#34;</a>. Indeed, with 0.86.0 the build still
fails. Trying the version immediately before, 0.85.11, the build finishes
correctly. This took more time than it sounds, one run including the tests
takes several hours. We need a way to shorten this somehow.</p>
<p>The Debian packaging of GCC allows to specify which languages you may want to
skip, and by default it builds Ada, Go, C, C++, D, Fortran, Objective
C, Objective C++, M2, and Rust. When running the tests sequentially,
the build logs stop roughly around the tests of a runtime library for D,
libphobos. So can we still reproduce the failure by skipping everything except
for D? With
<code>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nolang=ada,go,c,c++,fortran,objc,obj-c++,m2,rust</code>
the build still fails, and it fails faster than before. Several minutes, not
hours. This is progress, and time to file a bug. The report contains massive
spoilers, so no link. :-)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_stage_4_why_does_that_happen">Stage 4: Why does that happen?</h2>
<div>
<p>Something is causing the build to end prematurely. It’s not the OOM killer, and
the kernel does not have anything useful to say in the logs. Can it be that the
D language tests are sending signals to some process, and that is what’s
killing <code>make</code> ? We start tracing signals sent with <code>bpftrace</code> by writing the
following script, <code>signals.bt</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>tracepoint:signal:signal_generate {
    printf(&#34;%s PID %d (%s) sent signal %d to PID %d\n&#34;, comm, pid, args-&gt;sig, args-&gt;pid);
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And executing it with <code>sudo bpftrace signals.bt</code>.</p>
<p>The build takes its sweet time, and it fails. Looking at the trace output
there’s a suspicious <code>process.exe</code> terminating stuff.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>process.exe (PID: 2868133) sent signal 15 to PID 711826</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>That looks interesting, but we have no clue what PID 711826 may be. Let’s change
the script a bit, and trace signals received as well.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>tracepoint:signal:signal_generate {
    printf(&#34;PID %d (%s) sent signal %d to %d\n&#34;, pid, comm, args-&gt;sig, args-&gt;pid);
}

tracepoint:signal:signal_deliver {
    printf(&#34;PID %d (%s) received signal %d\n&#34;, pid, comm, args-&gt;sig);
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The working version of sbuild was using <code>dumb-init</code>, whereas the new one
features
<a href="https://salsa.debian.org/debian/sbuild/-/commit/e5a5dc7d258e939e62ad73f7b60f0b47507c6565">a
little init in perl</a>. We patch the current version of sbuild by making it use
<code>dumb-init</code> instead, and trace two builds: one with the perl init, one with
<code>dumb-init</code>.</p>
<p>Here are the signals observed when building with <code>dumb-init</code>.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>PID 3590011 (process.exe) sent signal 2 to 3590014
PID 3590014 (sleep) received signal 9
PID 3590011 (process.exe) sent signal 15 to 3590063
PID 3590063 (std.process tem) received signal 9
PID 3590011 (process.exe) sent signal 9 to 3590065
PID 3590065 (std.process tem) received signal 9</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And this is what happens with the new init in perl:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>PID 3589274 (process.exe) sent signal 2 to 3589291
PID 3589291 (sleep) received signal 9
PID 3589274 (process.exe) sent signal 15 to 3589338
PID 3589338 (std.process tem) received signal 9
PID 3589274 (process.exe) sent signal 9 to 3589340
PID 3589340 (std.process tem) received signal 9
PID 3589274 (process.exe) sent signal 15 to 3589341
PID 3589274 (process.exe) sent signal 15 to 3589323
PID 3589274 (process.exe) sent signal 15 to 3589320
PID 3589274 (process.exe) sent signal 15 to 3589274
PID 3589274 (process.exe) received signal 9
PID 3589341 (sleep) received signal 9
PID 3589273 (sbuild-usernsex) sent signal 9 to 3589320
PID 3589273 (sbuild-usernsex) sent signal 9 to 3589323</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are a few additional SIGTERM being sent when using the perl init, that’s
helpful. At this point we are fairly convinced that <code>process.exe</code> is worth
additional inspection. The
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=blob;f=libphobos/src/std/process.d;h=494910f35350927a561c98c78f6b19fe20a579a9;hb=HEAD#l1221">source
code of process.d</a> shows something interesting:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>1221 @system unittest
1222 {
[...]
1247     auto pid = spawnProcess([&#34;sleep&#34;, &#34;10000&#34;],
[...]
1260     // kill the spawned process with SIGINT
1261     // and send its return code
1262     spawn((shared Pid pid) {
1263         auto p = cast() pid;
1264         kill(p, SIGINT);</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>So yes, there’s our <code>sleep</code> and the SIGINT (signal 2) right in the unit tests
of <code>process.d</code>, just like we have observed in the bpftrace output.</p>
<p>Can we study the behavior of <code>process.exe</code> in isolation, separatedly from the
build? Indeed we can. Let’s take the executable from a failed build, and try
running it under /usr/libexec/sbuild-usernsexec.</p>
<p>First, we prepare a chroot inside a suitable user namespace:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>unshare --map-auto --setuid 0 --setgid 0 mkdir /tmp/rootfs
cd /tmp/rootfs
cat /home/ema/.cache/sbuild/unstable-arm64.tar | unshare --map-auto --setuid 0 --setgid 0 tar xf  -
unshare --map-auto --setuid 0 --setgid 0 mkdir /tmp/rootfs/whatever
unshare --map-auto --setuid 0 --setgid 0 cp process.exe /tmp/rootfs/</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now we can run <code>process.exe</code> on its own using the perl init, and trace signals at will:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>/usr/libexec/sbuild-usernsexec --pivotroot --nonet u:0:100000:65536  g:0:100000:65536 /tmp/rootfs ema /whatever -- /process.exe</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can compare the behavior of the perl init vis-a-vis the one using
<code>dumb-init</code> in milliseconds instead of minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_stage_5_oh_i_see">Stage 5: Oh, I see.</h2>
<div>
<p>Why does <code>process.exe</code> send more SIGTERMs when using the perl init is now the
big question. We have a simple reproducer, so this is where using <code>strace</code>
becomes possible.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>sudo strace --user ema --follow-forks -o sbuild-dumb-init.strace ./sbuild-usernsexec-dumb-init --pivotroot --nonet u:0:100000:65536  g:0:100000:65536 /tmp/dumbroot ema /whatever -- /process.exe</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here is what <code>process.exe</code> does under dumb-init:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>3593883 kill(-2, SIGTERM)               = -1 ESRCH (No such process)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>No such process. Under <code>perl-init</code> instead:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>3593777 kill(-2, SIGTERM &lt;unfinished ...&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The process <strong>is</strong> there under <code>perl-init</code>!</p>
<p>That is a kill with negative pid. From the <code>kill(2)</code> man page:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>If pid is less than -1, then sig is sent to every process in the process group whose ID is -pid.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>It would have been <strong>very</strong> useful to see this kill with negative pid in the
output of bpftrace, why didn’t we? The tracepoint used,
<code>tracepoint:signal:signal_generate</code>, shows when signals are actually being
sent, and not the syscall being called. To confirm, one can trace
<code>tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_kill</code> and see the negative PIDs, for example:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>PID 312719 (bash) sent signal 2 to -312728</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The obvious question at this point is: why is there no process group 2 when
using <code>dumb-init</code>?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_stage_6_how_did_that_ever_work">Stage 6: How did that ever work?</h2>
<div>
<p>We know that <code>process.exe</code> sends a SIGTERM to every process in the process
group with ID 2. To find out what this process group may be, we spawn a shell
with <code>dumb-init</code> and observe under <code>/proc</code> PIDs 1, 16, and 17. With <code>perl-init</code>
we have 1, <strong>2</strong>, and 17. When running dumb-init, there are a few forks before
launching the program, explaining the difference. Looking at <code>/proc/2/cmdline</code>
we see that it’s bash, ie. the program we are running under <code>perl-init</code>. When
building a package, that is <code>dpkg-buildpackage</code> itself.</p>
<p>The test is accidentally killing its own process group.</p>
<p>Now where does this <code>-2</code> come from in the test?</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>2363     // Special values for _processID.
2364     enum invalid = -1, terminated = -2;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Oh. -2 is used as a special value for PID, meaning &#34;terminated&#34;. And there’s a
call to kill() later on:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>2694     do { s = tryWait(pid); } while (!s.terminated);
[...]
2697     assertThrown!ProcessException(kill(pid));</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>What sets <code>pid</code> to <code>terminated</code> you ask?</p>
<p>Here is <code>tryWait</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>2568 auto tryWait(Pid pid) @safe
2569 {
2570     import std.typecons : Tuple;
2571     assert(pid !is null, &#34;Called tryWait on a null Pid.&#34;);
2572     auto code = pid.performWait(false);</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And <code>performWait</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>2306         _processID = terminated;</pre>
</div>
</div>
