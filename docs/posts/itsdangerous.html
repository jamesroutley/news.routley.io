<p>Sometimes you want to send some data to untrusted environments, then get
it back later. To do this safely, the data must be signed to detect
changes.</p>
<p>Given a key only you know, you can cryptographically sign your data and
hand it over to someone else. When you get the data back you can ensure
that nobody tampered with it.</p>
<p>The receiver can see the data, but they can not modify it unless they
also have your key. So if you keep the key secret and complex, you will
be fine.</p>

<h2>Example Use Cases<a href="#example-use-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Sign a user ID in a URL and email it to them to unsubscribe from a
newsletter. This way you don’t need to generate one-time tokens and
store them in the database. Same thing with any kind of activation
link for accounts and similar things.</p></li>
<li><p>Signed objects can be stored in cookies or other untrusted sources
which means you don’t need to have sessions stored on the server,
which reduces the number of necessary database queries.</p></li>
<li><p>Signed information can safely do a round trip between server and
client in general which makes them useful for passing server-side
state to a client and then back.</p></li>
