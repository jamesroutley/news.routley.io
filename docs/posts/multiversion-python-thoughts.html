    <h1>Multiversion Python Thoughts</h1>

  <p>written on Monday, September 9, 2024</p>
  

  <p>Now that <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> is rapidly advancing I have
started to dive back into making multi-version imports for Python work.
The goal here is to enable multiple resolutions from the solver in uv so
that two incompatible versions of a library can be installed and used
simultaniously.</p>
<p>Simplified speaking it should be possible for a library to depend on both
pydantic 1.x and 2.x simultaniously.</p>
<p>I have not made it work yet, but I have I think found all of the pieces
that stand in the way.  This post mostly exists to share how it could be
done with the least amount of changes to Python.</p>
<div id="basic-operation">
<h2>Basic Operation</h2>
<p>Python&#39;s import system places modules in a module cache.  This cache is
exposed via <cite>sys.modules</cite>.  Every module that is imported is placed in that
container prior to initialization.  The key is the import path of the
module.  This in some ways presents the first issue.</p>
<details><summary>Note on Terms for Packages, Modules and
Distributions</summary><p>Python&#39;s terms for packages are super confusing.  Here is what I will use
in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>foo.py</tt>: this is a python “module”.  It gets registered in
<cite>sys.modules</cite> as <tt>&#39;foo&#39;</tt> and has an attribute <cite>__name__</cite> set to
<tt>&#39;foo&#39;</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>foo/__init__.py</tt>: declares also a Python “module” named <tt>&#39;foo&#39;</tt> but
it is simultaniously a “package”.  Unlike a normal module it also has
two extra attributes: <tt>__path__</tt> which is set to <tt><span>[&#39;./foo&#39;]</span></tt> so that
sub modules can be found and it has an attribute <tt>__package__</tt> which
is also set to <tt>&#39;foo&#39;</tt> which marks it as package.</li>
<li>Additionally on PyPI one can register things.  These things were called
packages at one point and are now mostly called &#34;projects&#34;.  Within
Python however they are not called Projects but “distribution packages”.
For instance this is what you see when you try to use the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html">importlib.metadata</a>
API.  For now I will just call this a “distribution”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a distribution can ship both modules and multiple at once.  You
could have a package called <cite>whatever</cite> and it reports a <cite>foo.py</cite> file and
a <cite>bar/baz.py</cite> file which in turn would make <cite>foo</cite> and <cite>bar.baz</cite> be
importable.</p>
</details><p>Say you have two Python distributions both of which provide the same
toplevel package.  In that case they are going to clash in <cite>sys.modules</cite>.
As there is actually relationship of the distribution name to the entry in
<cite>sys.modules</cite> this is a problem that does not <em>just</em> exist with multi
version imports but it&#39;s one that does not happen all that much.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s say we have two distributions: <cite>foo@1.0.0</cite> and <cite>foo@2.0.0</cite>.  Both
expose a toplevel module called <cite>foo</cite> which is a true Python package with
a single <tt>__init__.py</tt> file.  The installer would already fail to place
these because one fully overrides the other.</p>
<p>So step 1 would be to place these modules in different places.  So where
they normally would be in <cite>site-packages</cite>, in this case we might want to
not have these packages there.  That solves us the file system clashes.</p>
<p>So we might place them in some extra cache that looks like this:</p>
<pre>.venv/
    multi-version-packages/
        foo@1.0.0/
            foo/
                __init__.py
        foo@2.0.0/
            foo/
                __init__.py
</pre>
<p>Now that package is entirely non-importable since nothing looks at
<cite>multi-version-packages</cite>.  We will need a custom import hook to get them
imported.  That import hook will also need to change the name of what&#39;s
stored in <cite>sys.modules</cite>.</p>
<p>So instead of registering <cite>foo</cite> as <tt><span>sys.modules[&#39;foo&#39;]</span></tt> we might want to
try to register it as <tt><span>sys.modules[&#39;foo@1.0.0&#39;]</span></tt> and
<tt><span>sys.modules[&#39;foo@2.0.0&#39;]</span></tt> instead.  There is however a catch and that
is this very common pattern:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>sys</span>

<span>def</span> <span>import_module</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>):</span>
    <span>__import__</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>modules</span><span>[</span><span>name</span><span>]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That poses a bit of a problem because someone is probably going to call
this as <tt><span>import_module(&#39;foo&#39;)</span></tt> and now we would not find the entry in
<tt>sys.modules</tt>.</p>
<p>This means that in addition to the new entries in <tt>sys.modules</tt> we would
also need to register some proxies that “redirect” us to the real names.
These proxies however would need to know if they point to <cite>1.0.0</cite> or
<cite>2.0.0</cite>.</p>
</div>

<div id="import-context">
<h2>Import Context</h2>
<p>The goal is that when <cite>slow_package/__init__.py</cite> imports <cite>foo</cite> we get
<cite>foo@1.0.0</cite> version, when <cite>myapp/__init__.py</cite> improts <cite>foo</cite> we get the
<cite>foo@2.0.0</cite> version.  What is needed for this to work is that the import
system understands not just what is imported, but who is importing.  In
some sense Python has that.  That&#39;s because <tt>__import__</tt> (which is the
entry point to the import machinery) gets the module globals.  Here is
what an import statement roughly maps to:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># highlevel import</span>
<span>from</span> <span>foo</span> <span>import</span> <span>bar</span>

<span># under the hood</span>
<span>_rv</span> <span>=</span> <span>__import__</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;foo&#39;</span><span>,</span> <span>globals</span><span>(),</span> <span>locals</span><span>(),</span> <span>[</span><span>&#39;bar&#39;</span><span>])</span>
<span>bar</span> <span>=</span> <span>_rv</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The name of the package that is importing can be retrieved by inspecting
the <cite>globals()</cite>.  So in theory for instance the import system could
utilize this information.  <tt><span>globals()[&#39;__name__&#39;]</span></tt> would tell us
<cite>slow_package</cite> vs <cite>myapp</cite>.  There however is a catch and that is that the
import name is not the distribution name.  The PyPI package could be
called <cite>mycompany-myapp</cite> and it exports a python package just called
<cite>myapp</cite>.  This happens very commonly in all kinds of ways.  For instance
on PyPI one installs <cite>Scikit-learn</cite> but the python package installed is
<cite>sklearn</cite>.</p>
<p>There is however another problem and that is interpreter internals and
C/Rust extensions.  We have already established that Python packages will
pass <cite>globals</cite> and <cite>locals</cite> when they import.  But what do C extensions
do?  The most common internal import API is called
<tt>PyImport_ImportModule</tt> and only takes a module name.  Is this a
problem? Do C extensions even import stuff?  Yes they do.  Here is an
example from pygame:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>MODINIT_DEFINE</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>color</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>{</span><span></span>
<span>     </span><span>PyObject</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>colordict</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>     </span><span>colordict</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>PyImport_ImportModule</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>&#34;pygame.colordict&#34;</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>     </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>colordict</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>     </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>         </span><span>PyObject</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>_dict</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>PyModule_GetDict</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>colordict</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>         </span><span>PyObject</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>colors</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>PyDict_GetItemString</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>_dict</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>&#34;THECOLORS&#34;</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>         </span><span>/* TODO */</span><span></span>
<span>     </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>     </span><span>else</span><span></span>
<span>     </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>         </span><span>MODINIT_ERROR</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>     </span><span>}</span><span></span>

<span>     </span><span>/* snip */</span><span></span>
<span> </span><span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>And that makes sense.  A sufficiently large python package will have
inter dependencies between the stuff written in C and Python.  It&#39;s also
complicated by the fact that the C module does initialize a module, but it
does not have a natural module scope.  The way the C extension initializes
the module is with the <tt>PyModule_Create</tt> API:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>static</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>PyModuleDef</span><span> </span><span>module_def</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>PyModuleDef_HEAD_INIT</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>&#34;foo&#34;</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>/* name of module */</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>NULL</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>-1</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>SpamMethods</span><span></span>
<span>};</span><span></span>

<span>PyMODINIT_FUNC</span><span></span>
<span>PyInit_foo</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>PyModule_Create</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>module_def</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>So both the name of the module created as well as the name of what is
imported is entirely hardcoded.  A C extension does not “know” what the
intended name is, it must know this on its own.</p>
<p>In some sense this is already a bit of a disconnect beween the Python and
C world.  Python for instance has relative imports (<tt>from .foo import
bar</tt>).  This is implemented by inspecting the globals.  There is however
no API to do these relative imports on the C layer.</p>
<p>The only workaround I know right now would be to perform stack walking.
That way one would try to isolate the shared library that triggered the
import to understand which module it comes from.  An alternative would be
to carry the current C extension module that is active on the interpreter
state, but that would most likely be quite expensive.</p>
<p>The goal would be to find out which <cite>.so</cite>/<cite>.dylib</cite> file triggered the
import.  Stack walking is a rather expensive operation and it can be
incredibly brittle but there might not be a perfect way around it.
Ideally Python would at any point know which c extension module is active.</p>
</div>
<div id="distributions-from-modules">
<h2>Distributions from Modules</h2>
<p>So let&#39;s say that we have the calling python module figured out: now we
need to figure out the associated PyPI distribution name.  Unfortunately
such a mapping does not exist at all.  Ideally when a <tt>sys.module</tt> entry
is created, we either record a special attribute there (say
<tt>__distribution__</tt>) which carries the name of the PyPI distribution name
so we can call <tt><span>importlib.metadata.distribution(__distribution__).requires</span></tt>
to get the requirements or we have some other API to map it.</p>
<p>In the absence of that, how could we get it?  There is an expensive way to
get a reverse mapping (<tt>importlib.metadata.packages_distributions</tt>) but
unfortunately it has some limitations:</p>
<ol>
<li>it&#39;s very slow</li>
<li>it has situations where it does not manage to reveal the distribution
for a package</li>
<li>it can reveal more than one distribution for a package</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of namespace packages in particular it can return more than one
distribution that provides a package such as <cite>foo</cite> (eg: <cite>foo-bar</cite> provides
<cite>foo.bar</cite> and <cite>foo-baz</cite> provides <cite>foo.baz</cite>.  In that case it will just
return both <cite>foo-bar</cite> and <cite>foo-baz</cite> for <cite>foo</cite>).</p>
<p>The solution here might just be that installers like <tt>uv</tt> start
materializing the distribution name onto the modules in one way or
another.</p>
</div>
<div id="putting-it-together">
<h2>Putting it Together</h2>
<p>The end to end solution might be this:</p>
<ol>
<li>install multi-version packages outside of <cite>site-packages</cite></li>
<li>materialize a <cite>__distribution__</cite> field onto modules or provide an API
that maps import names to their PyPI distribution name so that meta
data (requirements) can be discovered.</li>
<li>patch <cite>__import__</cite> to resolve packages to their fully-qualified, multi
version name based on who imports it<ul>
<li>via <cite>globals()</cite> for python code</li>
<li>via stack-walking for C extensions (unless a better option is
found)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>register proxy entries in <cite>sys.modules</cite> that have a dynamic
<cite>__getattr__</cite> which redirects to the fully qualified names if
necessary.  This would allow someone to access <tt><span>sys.modules[&#39;foo&#39;]</span></tt>
and automatically proxy it to <tt>foo@1.0.0</tt> or <tt>foo@2.0.0</tt>
respectively.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are lots of holes with this approach unfortunately.  That&#39;s in parts
because people patch around in <tt>sys.modules</tt>.  Interestingly enough
<tt>sys.modules</tt> can be manipulated but it can&#39;t be replaced.  This might
make it possible to replace that dictionary with some more magical
dictionary in future versions of Python potentially.</p>
