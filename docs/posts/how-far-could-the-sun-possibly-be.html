<p>Measuring the distance to the Sun is challenging, for reasons <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2024/01/17/why-is-it-so-hard-to-measure-the-distance-to-the-sun/" data-type="post" data-id="15877">explained in my last post.</a>  Long ago, the Greek thinker Aristarchus proposed <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2022/03/09/which-is-bigger-the-sun-or-the-earth-check-it-yourself/" data-type="post" data-id="11077">a geometric method</a>, which involves estimating the Moon‚Äôs sunlit fraction on a certain date. Unfortunately, because the Sun is so far away, his approach isn‚Äôt powerful enough; Aristarchus himself underestimated the distance.  <em>[This last remained true for later astronomers before the 17th century, though they got closer to the truth, presumably by using more precise methods than you or I could easily apply.  I doubt anyone truly found a <strong>maximum</strong> possible distance to the Sun just using geometry.]</em>  The best we can do, using Aristarchus‚Äô method and our naked eyes, is determine a <strong>minimum</strong> possible distance to the Sun: a few million miles. </p>

<p>Today we‚Äôll see how to obtain a <strong>maximum</strong> distance to the Sun, using an approach <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2024/01/17/why-is-it-so-hard-to-measure-the-distance-to-the-sun/" data-type="post" data-id="15877">suggested in the previous post</a>: by measuring <em><strong>speeds</strong></em>.  Specifically, we‚Äôll make use of a speed that the ancient astronomers weren‚Äôt aware of: <strong>the speed of light</strong>, also known as <strong>the cosmic speed limit <em>c</em></strong>.  That‚Äôs 186,000 miles (300,000 km) per second, or 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km) per year.  We‚Äôll find the Sun‚Äôs distance is less than 12 billion miles‚Ä¶ still much larger than its true distance, but a significant improvement on our starting point!</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll consider:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Earth‚Äôs speed around the Sun should be less than <em><strong>c</strong></em></li>



<li>The Sun should not be a black hole (i.e. light should be able to escape from its visible edge)</li>



<li>Clouds of particles blasted from the Sun should not be able to travel faster than <em><strong>c</strong></em></li>
</ul>







<h2>What We Can‚Äôt Learn From Light</h2>



<p>Before we make progress, let‚Äôs quickly dispense with an idea that is tempting but won‚Äôt work.   </p>



<p>If we could just measure the time that it takes for light to travel from the Sun to Earth, that would directly tell us the distance.  An obvious idea is to try to use solar flares, giant explosions that occur on the Sun and release powerful blasts of X-rays (an invisible form of light.)  If we could just compare the time when the X-rays arrive at Earth to the time they left the Sun, we could multiply that time by the speed of light and get the distance to the Sun.  Super easy!</p>



<p>The only problem is that we don‚Äôt know when they left the Sun.  We see the X-rays when they arrive at Earth.  We don‚Äôt know when they started their journey.  And so, we don‚Äôt have enough information, and the idea fails.</p>



<p>More generally, in order to use light directly to measure a distance, we have to know both the start time and the end time.  This is what is used by professionals when they bounce a powerful pulse of radio waves (another invisible form of light) off a distant planet and listen carefully with enormous antennas to the response: the time to go out and back, divided by two and multiplied by the speed of light, provides the distance.  But you and I can‚Äôt do that ourselves.  And there‚Äôs no natural process where we know both the departure time and the arrival time.</p>



<h2>Putting the Speed Limit to Use</h2>



<p>But even without light, <em><strong>c</strong></em><strong> sets a limit on the relative speeds between any two nearby objects </strong>‚Äî that‚Äôs the sense in which it is a cosmic speed limit.  That means the Earth can‚Äôt move faster than <em><strong>c</strong></em> relative to the Sun.  </p>



<p>We know that the Earth goes round the Sun once a year on a nearly-circular orbit whose radius is the Earth-Sun distance <strong><em>R<sub>ES</sub></em></strong> , and whose circumference is <strong><em>2</em><strong>ùùÖ</strong><em>R<sub>ES</sub></em></strong> .  Its average speed <strong>relative to the Sun</strong>, <strong><em>v<sub>E</sub></em></strong> , is its orbital distance divided by its orbital time, and that has to be less than <strong><em>c</em></strong>, so:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>v<sub>E</sub></em></strong> = <strong><em>2</em><strong>ùùÖ</strong><em>R<sub>ES</sub></em></strong> / (1 year) &lt; <strong><em>c</em></strong> = 9.5 trillion km / year</li>
</ul>



<p>from which we learn a maximum possible distance to the Sun:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>R<sub>ES</sub></em></strong>  &lt; (1 year) <strong><em>c</em></strong> / <strong><em>2</em><strong>ùùÖ</strong></strong> = 9.5 trillion km / <strong><em>2</em><strong>ùùÖ</strong></strong> = 1.5 trillion km = 0.94 trillion miles</li>
</ul>



<p>Not great, but at least we know the Sun can‚Äôt be a light-year away!</p>

<h2>Black Hole Sun?</h2>



<p>But we can do much better than that. <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2024/01/17/why-is-it-so-hard-to-measure-the-distance-to-the-sun/" data-type="post" data-id="15877">Rescaling the solar system</a> to make it larger and larger, putting the Sun far away while keeping the Earth‚Äôs orbital period unchanged, requires making the Sun‚Äôs mass enormous.  The pull of its gravity at its surface becomes greater, and if it is strong enough, even sunlight won‚Äôt be able to escape, and the Sun will form a black hole.   <em>(We might not want to assume Einstein‚Äôs view of gravity is correct, since we haven‚Äôt checked it ourselves. Still, we can be sure something rather drastic will happen to sunlight once it can‚Äôt escape in the usual manner.)</em></p>



<p>The <strong>escape velocity</strong> of an object is the minimum speed required to escape its gravitational pull from a particular location outside it.  But if we don‚Äôt know either the Sun‚Äôs mass or its radius, it is impossible to calculate the escape velocity from its visible surface.  Fortunately, the escape velocity can also be computed from the Sun‚Äôs radius <strong>and its density</strong> ‚Äî and we do know the density of the Sun from ocean tide patterns, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2024/01/12/what-ocean-tides-teach-us-about-the-sun/" data-type="post" data-id="15718">as I explained last week</a>.  It‚Äôs about 40% of the Moon‚Äôs density, and thus 25% of Earth‚Äôs.</p>



<p>Requiring the escape velocity be less than the cosmic speed limit gives us a maximum radius <span><em>R<sub>S</sub></em></span> for the Sun in terms of <em><strong>c</strong></em>, Newton‚Äôs gravitational constant <strong><em>G</em></strong> , and the sun‚Äôs density <strong><em><strong><em>‚ç¥<sub>S</sub></em></strong></em></strong> .  The formula for this turns out to be</p>



<ul>
<li><span><em> R<sub>S</sub> </em></span><strong><em>&lt; c</em></strong> [<span><em><strong><em>(</em><strong>8ùùÖ</strong><em>/3) G ‚ç¥<sub>S</sub></em></strong></em></span> ]<sup>-1/2</sup></li>
</ul>



<details><summary><em>If you‚Äôre curious, click here to see how this can be derived using simple math and physics.</em></summary>




<p>From Newton‚Äôs law of gravity, one can show that just outside the Sun‚Äôs visible surface, the escape velocity, in terms of the Sun‚Äôs mass and radius, is</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>(v<sub>escape</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = 2GM<sub>S</sub>/R<sub>S</sub> </em></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>(which one could guess, except for the 2, just using the physicist‚Äôs trick of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2022/06/21/dimensional-analysis-a-secret-weapon-in-physics/" data-type="post" data-id="12065">dimensional analysis</a>.)  We can write the Sun‚Äôs mass in terms of the Sun‚Äôs volume, <strong><em><strong><strong>(4ùùÖ</strong><em>/3) </em></strong>R<sub>S</sub><sup>3</sup></em></strong> , multiplied by the Sun‚Äôs density <strong><em><strong><em>‚ç¥<sub>S</sub></em></strong></em></strong>.  This gives us </p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>(v<sub>escape</sub>)<sup>2</sup></strong></em><strong><em> = <strong><em>(</em><strong>8ùùÖ</strong><em>/3) G ‚ç¥<sub>S</sub></em></strong> R<sub>S</sub><sup>2</sup> </em></strong> </li>
</ul>



<p>Finally, we require <strong><em>v<sub>escape</sub></em></strong> &lt; <em><strong>c</strong></em> for sunlight to escape the Sun, and solve for <strong><em>R<sub>S</sub></em></strong>  to get the above result.</p>
</details>







<p> Plugging in numbers we find</p>



<ul>
<li><em>R<sub>S</sub> &lt;  </em>340 million km = 210 million miles</li>
</ul>



<p>Meanwhile, the Sun‚Äôs angular size in the sky tells us that <strong><em>R<sub>ES</sub></em></strong> is about 215 times larger than <strong><em>R<sub>S</sub></em></strong> (and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2022/02/18/how-to-figure-out-the-distance-to-the-moon-yourself/">for the same reason, the same ratio relates the Moon‚Äôs distance and its radius.</a>.. or about a ratio of 100 between its distance and its diameter.) So we learn that the very fact that the Sun looks like an ordinary hot glowing object requires that</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>R<sub>ES</sub></strong></em>  = 215 <strong><em>R<sub>S</sub> </em></strong> &lt; 73 billion km = 45 billion miles.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now we‚Äôre making real progress!  </p>

<h2>Lesson From a Solar Flare</h2>



<p>Earlier on I pointed out that we can‚Äôt just use timing of a solar flare‚Äôs X-rays to measure our distance from the Sun.  But we can use the ‚Äúcoronal mass emission‚Äù (CME), the eruption of a great swarm of subatomic particles, that often accompanies the solar flare.  The cloud glows, so we can see it on satellites as it travels away from the Sun. </p>



<p>Particularly powerful flares often generate the fastest CMEs.  Here‚Äôs one blasting sideways off the limb of the Sun, shown in three stills taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg3NAdOYp8Q">this NASA video</a> <em>(see time 1:35-1:40 for the CME in question.)</em>  The blue and white image is the STEREO-B satellite‚Äôs data; the black central region is physically shielded, blocked so that full sunlight doesn‚Äôt blind the satellite‚Äôs camera; and the central red sphere indicates the size and location of the Sun behind the shield. </p>

(The Sun itself is blocked by the black disk, though an image has been placed within the disk to show the Sun‚Äôs location and size.)  The green box shows the CME‚Äôs general location at a time 2:40; by 3:25, the CME‚Äôs front edge has traveled a distance equal to four times the Sun‚Äôs diameter away from the green box.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>We can see from the images that the CME travels 4 times the diameter of the Sun, or 8 times its radius, in 45 minutes.  Since light travels 810 million km (500 million miles) in 45 minutes, the fact that the CME‚Äôs speed can‚Äôt exceed <em><strong>c</strong></em> tells us that the Sun‚Äôs radius can‚Äôt be more than 1/8th of that 810 million miles.  Specifically, </p>



<ul>
<li><em>R<sub>S</sub> &lt;  </em>810 million km / 8 = 100 million km = 60 million miles </li>
</ul>



<p>which implies, roughly, that</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>R<sub>ES</sub></strong></em>  = 215 <strong><em>R<sub>S</sub> </em></strong> &lt; 20 billion km = 12 billion miles.</li>
</ul>



<p>That‚Äôs a lot better than when we started!  Our range of possible distances is now below 10,000.</p>

<p>Incidentally, each of the three limits in Fig. 6 on the maximum distance to the Sun is probably an overestimate by a factor of 2 or 3.  We‚Äôve required that the various speeds can‚Äôt be greater than <em><strong>c</strong></em>, but actually they have to be somewhat smaller than that, because if any of them were near <strong><em>c</em></strong>, unusual phenomena would be observable by telescope or the naked eye.  We should therefore restrict the speeds in question to be perhaps 1/3 of <strong><em>c</em></strong>, reducing the maximum distance to the Sun by a corresponding factor in each case.</p>



<p>But these are minor details.  As we‚Äôll see in the next post, we can do much better. </p>
