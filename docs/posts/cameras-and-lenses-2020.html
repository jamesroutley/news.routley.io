    <p>Pictures have always been a meaningful part of the human experience. From the first cave drawings, to sketches and paintings, to modern photography, we’ve mastered the art of recording what we see.</p>
<p>Cameras and the lenses inside them may seem a little mystifying. In this blog post I’d like to explain not only how they work, but also how adjusting a few tunable parameters can produce fairly different results:</p>




<p>Over the course of this article we’ll build a simple camera from first principles. Our first steps will be very modest – we’ll simply try to take any picture. To do that we need to have a sensor capable of detecting and measuring light that shines onto it.</p>

<p>Before the dawn of the digital era, photographs were taken on a piece of film covered in crystals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_halide">silver halide</a>. Those compounds are light-sensitive and when exposed to light they form a speck of metallic silver that can later be developed with further chemical processes.</p>
<p>For better or for worse, I’m not going to discuss analog devices – these days most cameras are digital. Before we continue the discussion relating to light we’ll use the classic trick of turning the illumination off. Don’t worry though, we’re not going to stay in darkness for too long.</p>
