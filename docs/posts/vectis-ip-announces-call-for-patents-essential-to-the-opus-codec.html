<p><strong>London, UK: </strong></p><p><strong>UK-based IP and technology licensing company Vectis IP today announced a call for patents essential to the Opus codec. The upcoming patent pool license will cover the Opus interactive speech and audio codec, as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force. Initial participants in Vectis IP’s prospective pool include Fraunhofer and Dolby. The planned Opus program will focus on hardware devices and will not be directed towards open-source software, applications, services, or content.</strong></p><p>“We are pleased to act as administrator in the development of this important patent pool which aims to support efficient, fair, and transparent access to hundreds of patents covering technologies used in the Opus codec,” said Giustino de Sanctis, CEO of Vectis IP. “The reasonable royalty rates of this pool will balance the interests of both the program’s innovators and end-user device manufacturers whose products benefit from use of these patented technologies.”</p><p>Vectis IP expects to launch the program in the coming months and for the program to include access to hundreds of patents with a royalty rate in the range of €15-20c per unit. Royalties for willing licensees will be applicable from the program launch, with further incentives available for licensees that promptly execute a pool license.</p><p>Vectis IP welcomes other innovators with patents essential to Opus to submit applications for consideration in the program at opus@vectis.com.</p><p><strong>About Vectis IP Ltd</strong> </p><p><a href="https://www.vectis.com/">Vectis IP</a> is a UK-based IP and technology licensing company.
