<ul>
  <li>New function <code>filelib:ensure_path/1</code> will ensure that all directories for the given path exists</li>
  <li>New functions  <code>groups_from_list/2</code> and <code>groups_from_list/3</code> in the <code>maps</code> module</li>
  <li>New functions  <code>uniq/1</code> <code>uniq/2</code> in the <code>lists</code> module</li>
  <li>New PRNG added to the <code>rand</code> module, for fast pseudo-random numers.</li>

      </h3>
    

<ul>
  <li>Added support for selectable features as described in <a href="https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0060"><code>EEP-60</code></a>.
Features can be enabled/disabled during compilation with options
(ordinary and +term) to <code>erlc</code> as well as with directives in the file.
Similar options can be used to <code>erl</code> for enabling/disabling features
allowed at runtime. The new <code>maybe</code> expression <a href="https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0049"><code>EEP-49</code></a>
is fully supported as the feature maybe_expr.</li>

      </h3>
    

<ul>
  <li>The JIT now works for 64-bit ARM processors.</li>
  <li>The JIT now does type-based optimizations based on type
information in the BEAM files.</li>
  <li>Improved the JIT’s support for external tools like <code>perf</code>
and <code>gdb</code>, allowing them to show line numbers and even
the original Erlang source code when that can be found.</li>
</ul>

      </h3>
    

<ul>
  <li>Users can now configure ETS tables with the
<code>{write_concurrency, auto}</code> option. This option forces
tables to automatically change the number of locks that
are used at run-time depending on how much concurrency
is detected. The <code>{decentralized_counters, true}</code> option
is enabled by default when <code>{write_concurrency, auto}</code> is
active.</li>
  <li>To enable more optimizations, BEAM files compiled with
OTP 21 and earlier cannot be loaded in OTP 25.</li>
  <li>The signal queue of a process with
the process flag <code>message_queue_data=off_heap</code> has been optimized to
allow parallel reception of signals from multiple processes.
This can improve performance when many processes are sending in parallel to
one process. <a href="https://www.erlang.org/bench/sigq_bench_result.html">See benchmark</a>.</li>
  <li>The Erlang installation directory is now relocatable on
the file system given that the paths in the
installation’s RELEASES file are paths that are
relative to the installations root directory.</li>
  <li>A new option called <code>short</code> has been added to the
functions <code>erlang:float_to_list/2</code> and
<code>erlang:float_to_binary/2</code>. This option creates the
shortest correctly rounded string representation of the
given float that can be converted back to the same
float again.</li>
  <li>Introduction of <code>quote/1</code> and <code>unquote/1</code> functions in
the <code>uri_string</code> module - a replacement for the deprecated functions <code>http_uri:encode</code>
and <code>http_uri:decode</code>.</li>
  <li>The new module <code>peer</code> supersedes the <code>slave</code> module. The
<code>slave</code> module is now deprecated and will be removed in OTP 27.</li>
  <li><code>global</code> will now by default prevent
overlapping partitions due to network issues. This is done by
actively disconnecting from nodes that reports that
they have lost connections to other nodes. This will
cause fully connected partitions to form instead of
leaving the network in a state with overlapping
partitions.</li>
  <li>The <code>format_status/2</code> callback for <code>gen_server</code>, <code>gen_statem</code>
and <code>gen_event</code> has been deprecated in favor of the new
<code>format_status/1</code> callback.</li>
  <li>The <code>timer</code> module has been modernized and made more
efficient, which makes the timer server less
susceptible to being overloaded. The <code>timer:sleep/1</code>
function now accepts an arbitrarily large integer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>maybe ... end</code> construction as proposed in <a href="https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0049"><code>EEP-49</code></a>
has been implemented. It can simplify complex code
where otherwise deeply nested cases would have to be
used.</li>
  <li>When a record matching or record update fails, a
<code>{badrecord, ExpectedRecordTag}</code> exception used to be
raised. In this release, the exception has been changed
to <code>{badrecord, ActualValue}</code>, where <code>ActualValue</code> is the
value that was found instead of the expected record.</li>
  <li>Add compile attribute <code>-nifs()</code> to empower compiler and loader with
information about which functions may be overridden as NIFs by <code>erlang:load_nif/2</code>.</li>
  <li>Improved and more detailed error messages when binary construction with the
binary syntax fails.
This applies both for error messages in the shell and for
<code>erl_error:format_exception/3,4</code>.</li>
  <li>Change format of feature options and directives for better consistency.
Options to erlc and the <code>-compile(..)</code> directive now has the format <code>{feature,
feature-name, enable | disable}</code>. The <code>-feature(..)</code> now
has the format <code>-feature(feature-name, enable | disable)</code>.</li>
</ul>

          crypto <a href="#crypto">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<ul>
  <li>Add <code>crypto:hash_equals/2</code> which is a constant time comparision of hashvalues.</li>
</ul>
      <h3 id="ssl">
        
        
          ssl <a href="#ssl">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<ul>
  <li>Introducing a new (still experimental) option <code>{certs_keys,[cert_key_conf()]}</code>.
With this a list of a certificates with their associated key may be
used to authenticate the client or the server. The
certificate key pair that is considered best and matches
negotiated parameters for the connection will be selected.</li>
</ul>
      <h3 id="public_key">
        
        
          public_key <a href="#public_key">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<ul>
  <li>Functions for retrieving OS provided CA-certs added.</li>
</ul>
      <h3 id="dialyzer">
        
        
          dialyzer <a href="#dialyzer">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<ul>
  <li>Optimize operations in the <code>erl_types</code> module. Parallelize the Dialyzer pass remote.</li>
  <li>Added the <code>missing_return</code> and <code>extra_return</code> options to
raise warnings when specifications differ from inferred
types. These are similar to, but not quite as verbose
as overspecs and underspecs.</li>
  <li>Dialyzer now better understands the types for <code>min/2</code>,
<code>max/2</code>, and <code>erlang:raise/3</code>. Because of that, Dialyzer
can potentially generate new warnings. In particular,
functions that use <code>erlang:raise/3</code> could now need a spec
with a <code>no_return()</code> return type to avoid an unwanted
warning.</li>
</ul>
      <h3 id="misc">
        
        
          Misc <a href="#misc">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<ul>
  <li>A new <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/HOWTO/DEVELOPMENT.md">DEVELOPMENT HOWTO guide</a>
has been added that describes how to build and test Erlang/OTP when fixing
bugs or developing new functionality.</li>
  <li>Testing has been added to the Github actions run for each opened PR so
that more bugs are caught earlier when bug fixes and new features are proposed.</li>
