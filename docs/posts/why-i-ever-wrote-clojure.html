    <h1>Why I ever wrote Clojure</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
<p>I wrote Clojure professionally for 5 years. At first I loved it, and by the end I hated it, and for the same reason: I was bored.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t force myself to write generic enterprise code for soulless corporations. I just can&#39;t. I tried for so many years.</p>
<p>But I <em>can</em> force myself to write generic enterprise code for soulless corporations <em>if I can make it fun for myself</em>.</p>
<p>Enter Clojure. Or Go. Or Rust. Or Zig. Or <em>literally anything new and exciting.</em> (These were some of mine in chronological order.)</p>
<p>I suspect this is the real reason Clojure was created, I bet Rich was just really bored.
And I bet it&#39;s the real reason for its relatively high adoption in fintech. I bet those highly intelligent engineers were just <em>so bored</em>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an interesting problem: the highest paying jobs want the most intelligent engineers and are willing to pay them a ton.
The most intelligent engineers often need money but get bored <em>really</em> quickly, and usually <em>need</em> to scratch that intellectual itch.</p>
<p>And no matter how you slice it, writing enterprise code is <em>always</em> boring, it&#39;s a relatively solved problem.
Which explains why fintechs and similar have moved to saying &#34;<em>fine,</em> you can put your toys into the codebase.&#34;
At least this way they keep the turnover rate 2 years and not 2 months.</p>
<p>[edit for HN]: To clarify, I don&#39;t mean that Rich didn&#39;t <em>also</em> have extremely good reasons to make Clojure, given he was using Java (and maybe C++) <em>in 2007</em>. They&#39;re not the best languages now, but they were so broken back then that they practically <em>caused</em> the language revolution that caused Clojure and Go and Node etc to flourish.</p>
