    <h1>Overview of Consistency Levels in Database Systems</h1>

Database systems typically give users the ability to trade off correctness for performance. We have spent the previous <a href="http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.com/2019/05/introduction-to-transaction-isolation.html">two</a> <a href="http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.com/2019/06/correctness-anomalies-under.html">posts</a> in this series discussing one particular way to trade off correctness for performance: database isolation levels. In distributed systems, there is a whole other category for trading off correctness for performance: consistency levels. There are an increasing number of distributed database systems that are giving their users multiple different consistency levels to choose from, thereby allowing the user to specify which consistency guarantees are needed from the system for a particular application. Similar to isolation levels --- weaker consistency levels typically come with better performance, and thus come with the same types of temptations as reduced isolation levels.</p></div></div>
