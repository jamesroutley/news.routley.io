    <h1>Windows: Insecure by Design</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Opinion</span> I&#39;ve been pointing out Windows security bugs since Windows for Workgroups showed up in 1992 and I showed how you could steal data from your coworker&#39;s spreadsheets using Object Linking and Embedding (OLE). You&#39;d think Microsoft would have figured security out by now.</p>
<p>But no. It&#39;s only gotten worse – much worse.</p>
<p>In June 2023, Chinese hacking group Storm-0558 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/14/brad_smith_microsoft_hearing/">stole US government &#34;secure&#34; messages from Microsoft&#39;s Exchange Online</a>. I was only surprised that the Feds managed to catch them – Microsoft certainly didn&#39;t figure it out.</p>

    

<p>Former senior White House cyber policy director AJ Grotto said it best: he asserted it was fair to classify Microsoft and its products as a national security concern.</p>

        


        

<p>Think about it for a minute. What other business could get away with having products that are so bad that every month – <em>every month</em> – we have a day, Patch Tuesday, devoted to the latest fixes to their seemingly endless flaws?</p>
<p>These problems don&#39;t tend to be small corner cases either. No, take for example the latest one: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/12/june_patch_tuesday/">CVE-2024-30080</a>, a Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) remote code execution (RCE) issue, which earned a 9.8 out of 10 CVSS severity rating. A 9.8 on that scale, for those who don&#39;t know it, is a &#34;Patch it now or you will be pwned&#34; level.</p>

        

<p>Let&#39;s not forget <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/12/june_patch_tuesday/">CVE-2024-30078</a>, a Wi-Fi driver remote code execution hole, rated 8.8. Microsoft admitted this one could enable an attacker to hack your PC to remotely, silently, and wirelessly run malware or spyware.</p>
<p>Boy, does that make me feel warm and fuzzy about Microsoft or what!?</p>
<p>Really, that&#39;s just life with Windows. In the decades I&#39;ve been covering technology, I&#39;ve seen this level of security crapola over and over again.</p>

        

<p>What&#39;s really annoying me today is the security holes Microsoft is adding – by design – into Windows.</p>
<p>I mean of course Microsoft Recall. This delightful AI addition to the next generation of Windows PCs would have taken <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/22/windows_recall/">regular snapshots of everything you do on your computer</a>.</p>
<p>Let me emphasize the word &#34;everything.&#34; Your bank account numbers, your passwords, your cheat codes, your My Little Pony porn stash, how much money you lost betting on real-life ponies, etc. What would your partner think if they could scroll through your entire online life? Your mom? Or your boss using Microsoft Purview?</p>
<p>GDPR? What&#39;s that?</p>
<p>But, hey, who needs to worry? It&#39;s all safe on your computer, right? No one could get into your PC over Wi-Fi and start hoovering up all your Recall data, right?</p>

</ul>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>Recall, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/14/microsoft_recall_release_delayed/">which will now be optional</a>, is a security hole pretending to be a feature. Even if it were not such an invitation for privacy invasion, I&#39;m hard pressed to imagine what practical use it would be for anyone. We have more than enough useless data clogging up our drives without adding even more.</p>
<p>Finally, thinking of over-filling our storage, in another &#34;What were they thinking!?&#34; moment, with the latest releases Microsoft made it nigh on impossible to install Windows 11 without a Microsoft online account. I&#39;m not happy about that, but I could tolerate it.</p>
<p>What I can&#39;t stand is Microsoft <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/26/microsoft_makes_onedrive_avoidance_trickier/">automatically sets up OneDrive to back up my folders</a> whether I want it to or not. Not cool, Microsoft! Not cool at all. If I want to back up my files, I&#39;ll decide where I want them to go – not you.</p>
<p>I only have 5GB of free OneDrive storage, while I have terabytes of data in my personal directories. And, no, I won&#39;t be paying you for more storage, thank you very much. Instead, I&#39;ll use one of my Rocky Linux servers running Nextcloud, and I won&#39;t have to worry about Microsoft looking over my shoulder.</p>
<p>Besides, consider what the OneDrive automatic backup could do if paired with Recall? I, for one, don&#39;t want all my files open to Microsoft or Windows hackers. Do you?</p>
<p>Is it any wonder I&#39;ve been a Linux desktop user for over 30 years? The only question I have is: Will any of these latest Windows security fiascos finally get the rest of you to join me? I mean, how much punishment are you willing to take? ®</p>
