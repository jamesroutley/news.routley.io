<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>The workshop on <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives#volitional-muscles">building your volitional muscles</a> was very clarifying today and came at a perfect time. I’ve had a goal to improve both my JavaScript and my Python. I had originally decided to focus on JavaScript first and have been working through The Odin Project Foundations course. I didn’t actually get to the JavaScript content yet, though the command line basics and Git basics in particular have been very useful. But I have found myself gravitating toward Python in all of my RC programming so far, from the application to the first pairing workshop/mini project I worked on. I think I am going to switch to focusing on Python for now and put The Odin Project on pause. There is a CS50 Python course that I have been interested in for a while—I really loved CS50x. So I will start that now and focus on creating more small projects in Python along the way to practice.</li>
