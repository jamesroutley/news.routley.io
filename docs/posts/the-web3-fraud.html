    <h1>The Web3 Fraud</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span>With that background let’s look at the actual underlying technology of the current web and the “web3” vision.  Currently it will cost me roughly $20 a month to participate in this distributed computing system.</span></p><p><span>In the current web we start with the DNS lookup, which maps a human name to a server’s identity using a distributed system.  As a site operator I contract with a registrar to provide my domain name.  This is the first of two gatekeepers I will deal with, costing on the order of $10 a year.  I then also need to either run or contract out my DNS authority server operation, which the registrar will often provide if I don’t want to do it myself.</span></p><p><span>Now I set up my server and storage solution at the other gatekeeper: my hosting provider.  A good (if notoriously pricey) hosting solution is Amazon Web Services’s EC2.  I’m starting off with a small site, so I can probably get away with a micro-instance, which is 1 cpu core and 1 GB of memory for about $8 a month, with $.08/GB-month for the persistent storage and $.09/GB sent to visitors to my web site.</span></p><div><p><span>Finally, I actually construct my site.  My site really is a distributed computation split between my server and my users’ web browsers.  The visitor’s browser is running JavaScript which performs the user-side computations and presentation while my side consists of a HTTP server, my own custom logic, and probably a database to store user-data in an efficient manner.  This design splits the trust: the user’s browser is only trusted for that identified user’s data, while the server logic is trusted to access all users’ data.  Persistent storage is primarily on the server, but I can cache data on the client for faster access.  All told this is probably costing me $20 a month.</span></p></div><div><p><span>So what does the supposed “web3” add to this vision? The cryptocurrency web3 starts with all our existing infrastructure.  So I still need a DNS name, I still need a server, I still need storage, and I still have a distributed computation occurring between the browser and the server.  So already I haven’t removed any of the gatekeepers from the conventional distributed system, showing the claims of gatekeeper-free decentralization are false.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Web3 is only about adding an additional layer of complexity in the name of justifying the underlying cryptocurrencies.  The web browser is augmented with a cryptocurrency wallet and part of the computation and storage is shifted from my server to the decentralized cryptocurrency infrastructure.  When a user wants to use my service they will pay some amount of cryptocurrency to perform the cryptocurrency-side computation, with any remaining transferred to me as a fee for my service.  So does the new infrastructure provide anything useful?  Lets focus primarily on Ethereum, but the same problems appear regardless of the underlying cryptocurrency.</span></p></div><div><p><span>To begin with, Ethereum has the notion of coupling a small program to the transfer of Ethereum.  These programs are written in a language called Solidity and then compiled into a stack-machine based intermediate representation.  Of course letting arbitrary code potentially run forever wouldn’t work.  So instead any program is run for only a limited number of instructions until it either completes or is terminated. </span></p><p><span>The measure of the amount of compute is called “gas”, with various instructions and operations costing a different amount of gas to process.  The total cost of a transaction is the amount of gas consumed times the gas price.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Any given block of the Ethereum blockchain represents a maximum amount of execution, currently 30 million gas.  And the system adds a new block every 15 seconds, which means the total compute of the Ethereum network as 2 million gas/second, since that is the amount of computation that gets recorded into the Ethereum ledger.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Estimating the cost (measured in ‘gas’) of an arbitrary computation is complex but let’s assume that we are only interested in the most simple operation: 256 bit integer addition. Each addition costs 3 gas each.  So on a worldwide basis this system rates at 600,000 adds per second.</span></p></div><p><span>Compare this amount of compute to a Raspberry Pi 4, a $45 single-board computer which has four processors running at 1.5 GHz.  Each core has 2 ALUs and it will take 4 instructions to perform a 256 bit addition, as the basic unit for the Raspberry Pi (and most other modern computers) is 64 bits.  So each core has a peak performance of 750,000,000 adds per second for a total peak of 3,000,000,000 adds per second.  Put bluntly, the Ethereum “world computer” has roughly 1/5,000 of the compute power of a Raspberry Pi 4!</span></p><p><span>This might be acceptable if the compute wasn’t also terrifyingly expensive.  The current transaction fees for 30M in gas consumed is over 1 Ether.  At the current price of roughly $4000 per Ether this means a second of Ethereum’s compute costs $250.  So a mere second of Ethereum’s virtual machine costs 25 times more than a month of my far more capable EC2 instance.  Or could buy me several Raspberry Pis.</span></p><div><p><span>What about the storage?  The entire Ethereum blockchain is just 1 terabyte of data and adds a total of a few hundred kilobytes a minute.  Storing the Ethereum blockchain using a robust commercial service like Amazon S3 costs just $20 a month.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Even the most optimal storage strategy in Ethereum requires 600 gas per byte.  Yet the total network compute capacity is only 2M gas/second so storing 1 megabyte will require 300 seconds.   So not only can the Ethereum blockchain only store 3 kB of data a second, storing that 3kB costs $250!  So the cost of writing a single 3kB message to the Ethereum blockchain is the same price as a year of storage on Amazon for the entire 1 TB Ethereum blockchain.  Or the same price as buying a 1 TB M.2 SSD.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div>
