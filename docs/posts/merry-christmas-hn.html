    <h1>Merry Christmas, HN</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Just wanted to wish everybody here a Merry Christmas. HN is one of those Internet communities which I would be the saddest to see go, even looking back on other communities in which I&#39;ve participated over the years.</p><p>I see many posts here about loneliness, nihilism, friendships (or lack thereof) and just wanted to let everybody here know that life is never hopeless, and there are always people who care, even if they&#39;re thousands of miles away.</p><p>Please reach out to loved ones this season and let them know you love them. Life is short, and you never know when the last time you&#39;ll be wishing somebody a Merry Christmas will be.</p><p>I wish you all the very best for 2023.</p></div></div></div>
