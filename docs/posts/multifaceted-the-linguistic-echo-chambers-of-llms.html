    <h1>Multifaceted: The linguistic echo chambers of LLMs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is a fun one. </p>
<p>I’ve spent more time than I’d care to admit staring at LLM output. And there’s something that I’ve noticed: LLM-generated prose has a kind of… vibe. It’s difficult to describe, but in this initial era of LLMs, it tends to be fairly obvious when you’re reading an AI-generated piece of prose.</p>
<p>One giveaway I&#39;ve noticed is this particular turn of phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Culture is a <u>complex and multifaceted</u> ...” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/meme">true Dawkinsian sense</a>, the phrase <em>&#39;complex and multifaceted&#39;</em> has become a <strong>meme</strong>. I&#39;ve seen it again and again in outputs from GPT, but to double-check, I did a bunch of GPT-3.5 generations (<a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/padolsey/89469513af62b70301a2540bbf5fef7b/raw/9f479453116fcd0336377050eaa9c5b6e040602e/gen_gpt_complex_and_test.py">code here</a>). Here&#39;s what I found when generating completions for a prompt of <code>&#39;complex and ...&#39;</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.j11y.io/post_imgs/multifaceted/gpt_gens.png" alt="x"/></p>
<p>There is a bizarre prevalence of the term <em>&#39;multifaceted&#39;</em> specifically. Why?</p>
<p>I wanted to understand whether this phrase and the specific word <em>&#39;multifaceted&#39;</em> was newly popular or had existed for a while. As a first port of call, I had a look at Google Trends. And I observed a very shocking increase within the last year:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.j11y.io/post_imgs/multifaceted/goog.png" alt="google trends graph showing sharp climb in the last year for the word &#39;multifaceted&#39;"/></p>
<p>At this point I wanted to get an indication of whether this was an online-only trend. It&#39;s hard to establish this but I thought I&#39;d try Google Books&#39; N-gram viewer. Maybe it would show me. And, as suspected, we see <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=multifaceted&amp;year_start=2004&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=en-2019&amp;smoothing=3">no notable inflection</a>, although one can see there&#39;s a gentle increase over time.</p>
<p><em>Tangent</em>: For what it&#39;s worth, I find it a bit of a weird phrase. It&#39;s a tautology, as <em>&#39;complex&#39;</em> and <em>&#39;multifaceted&#39;</em> are almost synonomous. It reminds me of legal doublets like <em>&#39;null and void&#39;</em> and <em>&#39;cease and desist&#39;</em>. It&#39;s a rather nice and affirmatory way of saying something. I guess it sounds clever and informed, which is, after all, the vibe LLMs are going for.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to go a bit further in order to ensure this was actually a newly prevalent phrase online. Google Trends isn&#39;t very convincing by itself. So I went digging for other places where linguistic trends over time might be queryable. I discovered that <a href="https://web.archive.org/">web archive</a> helpfully retains various PDFs over the years, ranging from whitepapers to general reference material from accross the web. It allows you to search for specific keywords as well.</p>
<p>I carried out a bunch of searches from 2006 to 2022 As well as the word <em>&#39;multifaceted&#39;</em>. Oh and I was also interested in another viral word I&#39;d spotted: <em>&#39;intricate&#39;</em>. To ensure some level of scientific prudence, I compared these words with other terms as experimental controls.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.j11y.io/post_imgs/multifaceted/webarchive_keyphrases.png" alt="words like &#39;multifaceted&#39; and &#39;intricate&#39; increased drastically inline with LLM popularity, unlike control terms like &#39;efficacious&#39; and &#39;symbiotic&#39; which have remained stable"/></p>
<p>As we see, from 2021 onwards, just around the time when GPT and other LLMs started to take the world by storm, the prevalence of our word <em>&#39;multifaceted&#39;</em> increased significantly, from being in only 0.05% of PDFs to 0.23%.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Now, to zoom out a bit. I discovered the entire phrase, <em>&#39;a complex and multifaceted&#39;</em>, exists in around <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22a+complex+and+multifaceted%22">800,000 places</a> online.</p>
<p>If narrowed down, we see it composed of some particular domains ahead of others:</p>
<pre><code>Quora.com:      48,000
LinkedIn.com:   30,700
Facebook.com:   9,500
Instagram.com:  7,330
Medium.com:     6,250
Reddit.com:     1,370
CourseHero.com: 7,340
jstor.org:      1,320
wikipedia.org:  400
twitter.com:    798
classace.io:    842 (*notably an essay bank*)
chegg.com:      930 (*notably an essay bank*)
</code></pre>
<p>Quora has 5.7% of all occurances online! If it isn&#39;t the birthplace of this meme, it is definitely its breeding ground.</p>
<p>N.B. FWIW we can see what proportion Quora <em>~should</em> be taking up, all things being equal. An arbitrary word like &#34;systemic&#34; appears <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22systemic%22">445 million</a> online, yet only <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22systemic%22+site%3Aquora.com">272,000</a> times on Quora. That&#39;s 0.06% of all occurrances. So Quora&#39;s 5.7% share of our meme-phrase is completely disproportionate. Are we even surprised? Quora does have a reputation for its spam-bots. They are, at this point, mere regurgitation machines:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.j11y.io/post_imgs/multifaceted/quora_shots.png" alt="Tonnes of the same sentence structure repeated like &#39;philosophy is a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses.....&#39;"/></p>
<p>I also couldn&#39;t ignore the fact that Quora has lately been embedding a ChatGPT widget on almost every page, and this widget&#39;s content is pre-generated, static and available for crawling. It is thus liable to being used as additional training material for this and other LLMs.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.j11y.io/post_imgs/multifaceted/quora_chatgpt.png" alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT widget embedded in a quora page"/></p>
<p>ChatGPT specifically seems to absolutely adore the phrase, using it at every opportunity to explain higher level concepts. The most prevalent pattern seems to be <em>&#39;[noun] is a complex and multifaceted [concept|theory|process]&#39;</em>. Some common ones and their relative quantities across Quora:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;a complex and multifaceted concept&#34; - <code>4590</code></li>
<li>&#34;a complex and multifaceted issue&#34; - <code>4420</code></li>
<li>&#34;a complex and multifaceted process&#34; - <code>3550</code></li>
<li>&#34;a complex and multifaceted phenomenon&#34; - <code>2230</code></li>
<li>&#34;a complex and multifaceted emotion&#34; - <code>1650</code></li>
<li>&#34;a complex and multifaceted trait&#34; - <code>1560</code></li>
</ul>
<p><em>(these values vary across locales)</em></p>
<p>If we pick one of these and do a general search across the web, once again we observe incredibly sharp increases across time. The phrase <em>&#39;a complex and multifaceted phenomenon&#39;</em> has 74,900 occurances across the web according to Google. However, only 73 prior to 2010. That&#39;s a 1000x increase in only 13 years.</p>
<p>You get the idea. ChatGPT has taken this meme and and rolled with it. This silly LLM has assumed the phrase a core part of our language when it was only ever a narrowly used and awkward turn of phrase.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>What&#39;s the conclusion to this absurd rabbit hole? Have we learned anything?</strong></p>
<p>We know that initial versions of GPT were trained quite significantly on Reddit, and it&#39;s probably also the case that a small selection of other websites have been used since then to build and bolster additional models. </p>
<p>Focusing the training on any particular website will lead to strong biases. For example, fixating too much on academic material or websites like Quora where bots formulaically re-use certain phrases (this occurred even in the era before LLMs).</p>
<p>Furthermore, since these models have taken off in popularity, and people have then been publishing their outputs back onto the internet. As this occurs, it&#39;s likely produced a feedback loop. LLMs are unknowingly training on their own regurgitated outputs. It&#39;s unavoidable.</p>
<p>So, by those very tiny initial training decisions, just a handful of engineers have begun a unstoppable chain of incestuous linguistic evolution. It is fascinating how powerful these models are becoming in shifting the nature of language itself.</p>
