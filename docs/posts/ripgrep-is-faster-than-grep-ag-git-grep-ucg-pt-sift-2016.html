      <p>In this article I will introduce a new command line search tool,
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a>,
that combines the usability of
<a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">The Silver Searcher</a>
(an <a href="http://beyondgrep.com/"><code>ack</code></a> clone) with the
raw performance of GNU grep. <code>ripgrep</code> is fast, cross platform (with binaries
available for Linux, Mac and Windows) and written in
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>.</p>
<p><code>ripgrep</code> is available on
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">Github</a>.</p>
<p>We will attempt to do the impossible: a fair benchmark comparison between
several popular code search tools. Specifically, we will dive into a series of
25 benchmarks that substantiate the following claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>For both searching single files <em>and</em> huge directories of files, no other
tool obviously stands above <code>ripgrep</code> in either performance or correctness.</li>
<li><code>ripgrep</code> is the only tool with proper Unicode support that doesn’t make
you pay dearly for it.</li>
<li>Tools that search many files at once are generally <em>slower</em> if they use
memory maps, not faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>As someone who has worked on text search in Rust in their free time for the
last 2.5 years, and as the author of both <code>ripgrep</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex">the underlying regular expression engine</a>,
I will use this opportunity to provide detailed insights into the performance
of each code search tool. No benchmark will go unscrutinized!</p>
<p><strong>Target audience</strong>: Some familiarity with Unicode, programming and some
experience with working on the command line.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: I’m hearing reports from some people that <code>rg</code> isn’t as fast as I’ve
claimed on their data. I’d love to help explain what’s going on, but to do
that, I’ll need to be able to reproduce your results. If you
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues">file an issue</a>
with something I can reproduce, I’d be happy to try and explain it.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-ripgrep">Introducing ripgrep</h2>
<h3 id="pitch">Pitch</h3>
<p>Why should you use <code>ripgrep</code> over any other search tool? Well…</p>
<ul>
<li>It can replace many use cases served by other search tools
because it contains most of their features and is generally faster. (See
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/FAQ.md#posix4ever">the FAQ</a>
for more details on whether ripgrep can truly replace grep.)</li>
<li>Like other tools specialized to code search, ripgrep defaults to recursive
directory search and won’t search files ignored by your <code>.gitignore</code> files.
It also ignores hidden and binary files by default. ripgrep also implements
full support for <code>.gitignore</code>, whereas there are many bugs related to that
functionality in other code search tools claiming to provide the same
functionality.</li>
<li>ripgrep can search specific types of files. For example, <code>rg -tpy foo</code>
limits your search to Python files and <code>rg -Tjs foo</code> excludes Javascript
files from your search. ripgrep can be taught about new file types with
custom matching rules.</li>
<li>ripgrep supports many features found in <code>grep</code>, such as showing the context
of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with
color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, ripgrep stays fast while
supporting Unicode (which is always on).</li>
<li>ripgrep has optional support for switching its regex engine to use PCRE2.
Among other things, this makes it possible to use look-around and
backreferences in your patterns, which are not supported in ripgrep’s default
regex engine. PCRE2 support is enabled with <code>-P</code>.</li>
<li>ripgrep supports searching files in text encodings other than UTF-8, such
as UTF-16, latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS and more. (Some support for
automatically detecting UTF-16 is provided. Other text encodings must be
specifically specified with the <code>-E/--encoding</code> flag.)</li>
<li>ripgrep supports searching files compressed in a common format (gzip, xz,
lzma, bzip2 or lz4) with the <code>-z/--search-zip</code> flag.</li>
<li>ripgrep supports arbitrary input preprocessing filters which could be PDF
text extraction, less supported decompression, decrypting, automatic encoding
detection and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
bugs and Unicode support.</p>
<h3 id="anti-pitch">Anti-pitch</h3>
<p>I’d like to try to convince you why you <em>shouldn’t</em> use <code>ripgrep</code>. Often, this
is far more revealing than reasons why I think you <em>should</em> use <code>ripgrep</code>.</p>
<p>Despite initially not wanting to add every feature under the sun to ripgrep,
over time, ripgrep has grown support for most features found in other
file searching tools. This includes searching for results spanning across
multiple lines, and opt-in support for PCRE2, which provides look-around and
backreference support.</p>
<p>At this point, the primary reasons not to use ripgrep probably consist of one
or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need a portable and ubiquitous tool. While ripgrep works on Windows,
macOS and Linux, it is not ubiquitous and it does not conform to any
standard such as POSIX. The best tool for this job is good old grep.</li>
<li>There still exists some other feature (or bug) not listed in this README that
you rely on that’s in another tool that isn’t in ripgrep.</li>
<li>There is a performance edge case where ripgrep doesn’t do well where another
tool does do well. (Please file a bug report!)</li>
<li>ripgrep isn’t possible to install on your machine or isn’t available for your
platform. (Please file a bug report!)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>The binary name for <code>ripgrep</code> is <code>rg</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases">Binaries for <code>ripgrep</code> are available for Windows, Mac and
Linux.</a> Linux binaries are
static executables. Windows binaries are available either as built with MinGW
(GNU) or with Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC). When possible, prefer MSVC over GNU,
but you’ll need to have the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145">Microsoft VC++ 2015 redistributable</a>
installed.</p>
<p>If you’re a <strong>Homebrew</strong> user, then you can install it like so:</p>






<p>If you’re an <strong>Archlinux</strong> user, then you can install <code>ripgrep</code> from the
official repos:</p>






<p>If you’re a <strong>Rust programmer</strong>, <code>ripgrep</code> can be installed with <code>cargo</code>:</p>






<p>If you’d like to build <code>ripgrep</code> from source, that is also easy to do.
<code>ripgrep</code> is written in Rust, so you’ll need to grab a
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust installation</a> in order to compile it.
<code>ripgrep</code> compiles with Rust 1.9 (stable) or newer. To build:</p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>$ git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
</span></span><span><span>$ <span>cd</span> ripgrep
</span></span><span><span>$ cargo build --release
</span></span><span><span>$ ./target/release/rg --version
</span></span><span><span>0.1.2</span></span></code></pre></div>


<p>If you have a Rust nightly compiler, then you can enable optional SIMD
acceleration like so, which is used in all benchmarks reported in this article.</p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span><span>RUSTFLAGS</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;-C target-cpu=native&#34;</span> cargo build --release --features simd-accel</span></span></code></pre></div>


<h3 id="whirlwind-tour">Whirlwind tour</h3>
<p>The command line usage of <code>ripgrep</code> doesn’t differ much from other tools that
perform a similar function, so you probably already know how to use <code>ripgrep</code>.
The full details can be found in <code>rg --help</code>, but let’s go on a whirlwind tour.</p>
<p><code>ripgrep</code> detects when its printing to a terminal, and will automatically
colorize your output and show line numbers, just like The Silver Searcher.
Coloring works on Windows too! Colors can be controlled more granularly with
the <code>--color</code> flag.</p>
<p>One last thing before we get started: generally speaking, <code>ripgrep</code> assumes the
input is reading is UTF-8. However, if ripgrep notices a file is encoded as
UTF-16, then it will know how to search it. For other encodings, you’ll need to
explicitly specify them with the <code>-E/--encoding</code> flag.</p>
<p>To recursively search the current directory, while respecting all <code>.gitignore</code>
files, ignore hidden files and directories and skip binary files:</p>






<p>The above command also respects all <code>.rgignore</code> files, including in parent
directories. <code>.rgignore</code> files can be used when <code>.gitignore</code> files are
insufficient. In all cases, <code>.rgignore</code> patterns take precedence over
<code>.gitignore</code>.</p>
<p>To ignore all ignore files, use <code>-u</code>. To additionally search hidden files
and directories, use <code>-uu</code>. To additionally search binary files, use <code>-uuu</code>.
(In other words, “search everything, dammit!”) In particular, <code>rg -uuu</code> is
similar to <code>grep -a -r</code>.</p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>$ rg -uu foobar  <span># similar to `grep -r`</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ rg -uuu foobar  <span># similar to `grep -a -r`</span></span></span></code></pre></div>


<p>(Tip: If your ignore files aren’t being adhered to like you expect, run your
search with the <code>--debug</code> flag.)</p>
<p>Make the search case insensitive with <code>-i</code>, invert the search with <code>-v</code> or
show the 2 lines before and after every search result with <code>-C2</code>.</p>
<p>Force all matches to be surrounded by word boundaries with <code>-w</code>.</p>
<p>Search and replace (find first and last names and swap them):</p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>$ rg <span>&#39;([A-Z][a-z]+)\s+([A-Z][a-z]+)&#39;</span> --replace <span>&#39;$2, $1&#39;</span></span></span></code></pre></div>


<p>Named groups are supported:</p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>$ rg <span>&#39;(?P&lt;first&gt;[A-Z][a-z]+)\s+(?P&lt;last&gt;[A-Z][a-z]+)&#39;</span> --replace <span>&#39;$last, $first&#39;</span></span></span></code></pre></div>


<p>Up the ante with full Unicode support, by matching any uppercase Unicode letter
followed by any sequence of lowercase Unicode letters (good luck doing this
with other search tools!):</p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>$ rg <span>&#39;(\p{Lu}\p{Ll}+)\s+(\p{Lu}\p{Ll}+)&#39;</span> --replace <span>&#39;$2, $1&#39;</span></span></span></code></pre></div>


<p>Search only files matching a particular glob:</p>






<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Or exclude files matching a particular glob:</p>






<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Search only HTML and CSS files:</p>






<p>Search everything except for Javascript files:</p>






<p>To see a list of types supported, run <code>rg --type-list</code>. To add a new type, use
<code>--type-add</code>, which must be accompanied by a pattern for searching (<code>rg</code> won’t
persist your type settings):</p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>$ rg --type-add <span>&#39;foo:*.{foo,foobar}&#39;</span> -tfoo bar</span></span></code></pre></div>


<p>The type <code>foo</code> will now match any file ending with the <code>.foo</code> or <code>.foobar</code>
extensions.</p>
<h3 id="regex-syntax">Regex syntax</h3>
<p>The syntax supported is
<a href="https://docs.rs/regex/1.*/regex/#syntax">documented as part of Rust’s regex library</a>.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-grep">Anatomy of a grep</h2>
<p>Before we dive into benchmarks, I thought it might be useful to provide a high
level overview of how a grep-like search tool works, with a special focus on
<code>ripgrep</code> in particular. The goal of this section is to provide you with a bit
of context that will help make understanding the analysis for each benchmark
easier.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Modulo parsing command line arguments, the first “real” step in any search tool
is figuring out what to search. Tools like <code>grep</code> don’t try to do anything
smart: they simply search the files given to it on the command line. An
exception to this is the <code>-r</code> flag, which will cause <code>grep</code> to recursively
search all files in the current directory. Various command line flags can be
passed to control which files are or aren’t searched.</p>
<p><a href="http://beyondgrep.com/"><code>ack</code></a> came along and turned this type of default
behavior on its head. Instead of trying to search everything by default, <code>ack</code>
tries to be smarter about what to search. For example, it will recursively
search your current directory <em>by default</em>, and it will automatically skip over
any source control specific files and directories (like <code>.git</code>). This method
of searching undoubtedly has its own pros and cons, because it tends to make
the tool “smarter,” which is another way of saying “opaque.” That is, when
you really do need the tool to search everything, it can sometimes be tricky
to know how to speak the right incantation for it to do so. With that said,
being smart by default is incredibly convenient, especially when “smart” means
“figure out what to search based on your source control configuration.” There’s
no shell alias that can do that with <code>grep</code>.</p>
<p>All of the other search tools in this benchmark share a common ancestor with
either <code>grep</code> or <code>ack</code>. <code>sift</code> is descended from <code>grep</code>, while <code>ag</code>, <code>ucg</code>, and
<code>pt</code> are descended from <code>ack</code>. <code>ripgrep</code> is a bit of a hybrid because it was
specifically built to be good at searching huge files just like <code>grep</code>, but at
the same time, provide the “smart” kind of default searching like <code>ack</code>.
Finally, <code>git grep</code> deserves a bit of a special mention. <code>git grep</code> is very
similar to plain <code>grep</code> in the kinds of options it supports, but its default
mode of searching is clearly descended from <code>ack</code>: it will only search files
checked into source control.</p>
<p>Of course, both types of search tools have <em>a lot</em> in common, but there are a
few broad distinctions worth making if you allow yourself to squint your eyes a
bit:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>grep</code>-like tools need to be really good at searching large files, so the
performance of the underlying regex library is paramount.</li>
<li><code>ack</code>-like tools need to be really good at recursive directory traversal
while also applying ignore rules from files like <code>.gitignore</code> quickly.
<code>ack</code>-like tools are built to run many searches in parallel, so the raw
performance of the underlying regex library can be papered over somewhat
while still being faster than single-threaded “search everything” tools like
<code>grep</code>. If the “smarts” of <code>ack</code> also mean skipping over that 2GB artifact
in your directory tree, then the performance difference becomes even bigger.</li>
<li><code>ripgrep</code> tries hard to combine the best of both worlds. Not only is its
underlying regex engine very fast, but it parallelizes searches and tries to
be smart about what it searches too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gathering-files-to-search">Gathering files to search</h3>
<p>For an <code>ack</code>-like tool, it is important to figure out which files to search in
the current directory. This means using a very fast recursive directory
iterator, filtering file paths quickly and distributing those file paths to a
pool of workers that actually execute the search.</p>
<p>Directory traversal can be tricky because some recursive directory
iterators make more stat calls than are strictly necessary, which
can have a large impact on performance. It can be terribly difficult
to track down these types of performance problems because they
tend to be buried in a standard library somewhere. <a href="http://benhoyt.com/writings/scandir/">Python only
recently fixed this</a>, for
example. Rest assured that <a href="https://docs.rs/walkdir"><code>ripgrep</code> uses a recursive directory
iterator</a> that makes the minimum number
of system calls possible.</p>
<p>Filtering file paths requires not only respecting rules given at the command
line (e.g., <code>grep</code>’s <code>--include</code> or <code>--exclude</code>) flags, but also requires
reading files like <code>.gitignore</code> and applying their rules correctly to all file
paths. Even the mere act of looking for a <code>.gitignore</code> file in every directory
can have measurable overhead! Otherwise, the key performance challenge with
this functionality is making sure you don’t try to match every ignore rule
individually against every file path. Large repositories like the Linux kernel
source tree have over a hundred <code>.gitignore</code> files with thousands of rules
combined.</p>
<p>Finally, distributing work to other threads for searching requires some kind of
synchronization. One solution is a mutex protected ring buffer that acts as
a sort of queue, but there are lock-free solutions that might be faster.
Rust’s ecosystem is so great that I was able to reuse a lock-free <a href="https://github.com/kinghajj/deque">Chase-Lev
work-stealing queue</a> for distributing work
to a pool of searchers. Every <em>other</em> tool that parallelizes work in this
benchmark uses a variant of a mutex protected queue. (<code>sift</code> and <code>pt</code> might not
fit this criteria, since they use Go channels, and I haven’t followed any
implementation improvements to that code for a few years.)</p>
<h3 id="searching">Searching</h3>
<p>Searching is the heart of any of these tools, and we could dig ourselves into a
hole on just this section alone and not come out alive for at least 2.5 years.
(Welcome to “How Long I’ve Been Working On Text Search In Rust.”) Instead, we
will lightly touch on the big points.</p>
<h4 id="regex-engine">Regex engine</h4>
<p>First up is the regex engine. Every search tool supports some kind of syntax
for regular expressions. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>foo|bar</code> matches any literal string <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code></li>
<li><code>[a-z]{2}_[a-z]+</code> matches two lowercase latin letters, followed by an
underscore, followed by one or more lowercase latin letters.</li>
<li><code>\bfoo\b</code> matches the literal <code>foo</code> only when it is surrounded by word
boundaries. For example, the <code>foo</code> in <code>foobar</code> won’t match but it will in
<code>I love foo.</code>.</li>
<li><code>(\w+) \1</code> matches any sequence of word characters followed by a space and
followed by exactly the word characters that were matched previously. The
<code>\1</code> in this example is called a “back-reference.” For example, this pattern
will match <code>foo foo</code> but not <code>foo bar</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regular expression engines themselves tend to be divided into two categories
predominantly based on the features they expose. Regex engines that provide
support for all of the above tend to use an approach called <em>backtracking</em>,
which is typically quite fast, but can be very slow on some inputs. “Very
slow” in this case means that it might take exponential time to complete a
search. For example, try running this Python code:</p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>re</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>search</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;(a*)*c&#39;</span><span>,</span> <span>&#39;a&#39;</span> <span>*</span> <span>30</span><span>)</span></span></span></code></pre></div>


<p>Even though both the regex and the search string are tiny, it will take a very
long time to terminate, and this is because the underlying regex engine uses
backtracking, and can therefore take exponential time to answer some queries.</p>
<p>The other type of regex engine generally supports fewer features and is based
on finite automata. For example, these kinds of regex engines typically don’t
support back-references. Instead, these regex engines will often provide a
guarantee that <em>all searches</em>, regardless of the regex or the input, will
complete in linear time with respect to the search text.</p>
<p>It’s worth pointing out that neither type of engine has a monopoly on average
case performance. There are examples of regex engines of both types that are
blazing fast. With that said, here’s a breakdown of some search tools and the
type of regex engine they use:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNU grep and <code>git grep</code> each use their own hand-rolled finite automata based
engine.</li>
<li><code>ripgrep</code> uses
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex">Rust’s regex library</a>,
which uses finite automata.</li>
<li>The Silver Searcher and Universal Code Grep use <a href="http://www.pcre.org/">PCRE</a>,
which uses backtracking.</li>
<li>Both The Platinum Searcher and sift use
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/">Go’s regex library</a>,
which uses finite automata.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Rust’s regex library and Go’s regex library share Google’s
<a href="https://github.com/google/re2">RE2</a>
as a common ancestor.</p>
<p>Finally, both tools that use PCRE (The Silver Searcher and Universal Code Grep)
are susceptible to worst case backtracking behavior. For example:</p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>$ cat wat
</span></span><span><span>c
</span></span><span><span>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
</span></span><span><span>c
</span></span><span><span>$ ucg <span>&#39;(a*)*c&#39;</span> wat
</span></span><span><span>terminate called after throwing an instance of <span>&#39;FileScannerException&#39;</span>
</span></span><span><span>  what<span>()</span>:  PCRE2 match error: match limit exceeded
</span></span><span><span>Aborted <span>(</span>core dumped<span>)</span></span></span></code></pre></div>


<p>The Silver Searcher fails similarly. It reports the first line as a match and
neglects the match in the third line. The rest of the search tools benchmarked
in this article handle this case without a problem.</p>
<h4 id="literal-optimizations">Literal optimizations</h4>
<p>Picking a fast regex engine is important, because every search tool will need
to rely on it sooner or later. Nevertheless, even the performance of the
fastest regex engine can be dwarfed by the time it takes to search for a simple
literal string.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string_search_algorithm">Boyer-Moore</a>
is the classical algorithm that is used to find a substring, and even today, it
is hard to beat for general purpose searching. One of its defining qualities is
its ability to skip some characters in the search text by pre-computing a small
skip table at the beginning of the search.</p>
<p>On modern CPUs, the key to making a Boyer-Moore implementation fast is not
necessarily the number of characters it can skip, but how fast it can identify
a candidate for a match. For example, most Boyer-Moore implementations look for
the <em>last</em> byte in a literal. Each occurrence of that byte is considered a
candidate for a match by Boyer-Moore. It is only at this point that Boyer-Moore
can use its precomputed table to skip characters, which means you still need a
fast way of identifying the candidate in the first place. Thankfully,
specialized routines found in the C standard library, like
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memchr.3.html"><code>memchr</code></a>,
exist for precisely this purpose. Often, <code>memchr</code> implementations are compiled
down to SIMD instructions that examine <em>sixteen</em> bytes in a single loop
iteration. This makes it very fast. On my system, <code>memchr</code> often gets
throughputs at around several gigabytes a second. (In my own experiments,
Boyer-Moore with <code>memchr</code> can be just as fast as an explicit SIMD
implementation using the
<a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#text=PCMPESTR&amp;expand=786">PCMPESTRI</a>
instruction, but this is something I’d like to revisit.)</p>
<p>For a search tool to compete in most benchmarks, either it or its regex engine
needs to use some kind of literal optimizations. For example, Rust’s regex
library goes to great lengths to extract both prefix and suffix literals from
every pattern. The following patterns all have literals extracted from them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>foo|bar</code> detects <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code></li>
<li><code>(a|b)c</code> detects <code>ac</code> and <code>bc</code></li>
<li><code>[ab]foo[yz]</code> detects <code>afooy</code>, <code>afooz</code>, <code>bfooy</code> and <code>bfooz</code></li>
<li><code>(foo)?bar</code> detects <code>foobar</code> and <code>bar</code></li>
<li><code>(foo)*bar</code> detects <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code></li>
<li><code>(foo){3,6}</code> detects <code>foofoofoo</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these patterns appear at the <em>beginning</em> of a regex, Rust’s regex
library will notice them and use them to find candidate matches very quickly
(even when there is more than one literal detected). While Rust’s core regex
engine is fast, it is still faster to look for literals first, and only drop
down into the core regex engine when it’s time to verify a match.</p>
<p>The best case happens when an entire regex can be broken down into a single
literal or an alternation of literals. In that case, the core regex engine
won’t be used at all!</p>
<p>A search tool in particular has an additional trick up its sleeve. Namely,
since most search tools do line-by-line searching (The Silver Searcher is a
notable exception, which does multiline searching by default), they can extract
<em>non-prefix</em> or “inner” literals from a regex pattern, and search for those to
identify candidate <em>lines</em> that match. For example, the regex <code>\w+foo\d+</code> could
have <code>foo</code> extracted. Namely, when a candidate line is found, <code>ripgrep</code> will
find the beginning and end of only that line, and then run the full regex
engine on the entire line. This lets <code>ripgrep</code> very quickly skip through files
by staying out of the regex engine. Most of the search tools we benchmark here
don’t perform this optimization, which can leave a lot of performance on the
table, especially if your core regex engine isn’t that fast.</p>
<p>Handling the case of multiple literals (e.g., <code>foo|bar</code>) is just as important.
GNU grep uses a little known algorithm similar to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentz-Walter_algorithm">Commentz-Walter</a>
for searching multiple patterns. In short, Commentz-Walter is what you get when
you merge
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm">Aho-Corasick</a>
with Boyer-Moore: a skip table with a <em>reverse</em> automaton.
Rust’s regex library, on the other hand, will either use plain Aho-Corasick,
or, when enabled, a special
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/blob/3de8c44f5357d5b582a80b7282480e38e8b7d50d/src/simd_accel/teddy128.rs">SIMD algorithm called
Teddy</a>,
which was invented by Geoffrey Langdale as part of the
<a href="https://github.com/01org/hyperscan">Hyperscan regex library</a>
developed by Intel. This SIMD algorithm will prove to be at least one of the
key optimizations that propels <code>ripgrep</code> past GNU grep.</p>
<p>The great thing about this is that <code>ripgrep</code> doesn’t have to do much of this
literal optimization work itself. Most of it is done inside Rust’s regex
library, so every consumer of that library gets all these performance
optimizations automatically!</p>
<h4 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h4>
<p>Repeat after me: Thou Shalt Not Search Line By Line.</p>
<p>The naive approach to implementing a search tool is to read a file line by line
and apply the search pattern to each line individually. This approach is
problematic primarily because, in the common case, finding a match is <em>rare</em>.
Therefore, you wind up doing a ton of work parsing out each line all for
naught, because most files simply aren’t going to match at all in a large
repository of code.</p>
<p>Not only is finding every line extra work that you don’t need to do, but you’re
also paying a huge price in overhead. Whether you’re searching for a literal or
a regex, you’ll need to start and stop that search for every single line in a
file. The overhead of each search will be your undoing.</p>
<p>Instead, all search tools find a way to search a big buffer of bytes all at
once. Whether that’s memory mapping a file, reading an entire file into memory
at once or incrementally searching a file using a constant sized intermediate
buffer, they all find a way to do it to some extent. There are some exceptions
though. For example, tools that use memory maps or read entire files into
memory either can’t support <code>stdin</code> (like Universal Code Grep), or revert to
line-by-line searching (like The Silver Searcher). Tools that support
incremental searching (<code>ripgrep</code>, GNU grep and <code>git grep</code>) can use its
incremental approach on any file or stream with no problems.</p>
<p>There’s a reason why not every tool implements incremental search: it’s <em>hard</em>.
For example, you need to consider all of the following in a fully featured
search tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line counting, when requested.</li>
<li>If a read from a file ends in the middle of a line, you need to do the
bookkeeping required to make sure the incomplete line isn’t searched until
more data is read from the file.</li>
<li>If a line is too long to fit into your buffer, you need to decide to either
give up or grow your buffer to fit it.</li>
<li>Your searcher needs to know how to invert the match.</li>
<li>Worst of all: your searcher needs to be able to show the context of a match,
e.g., the lines before and after a matching line. For example, consider the
case of a match that appears at the beginning of your buffer. How do you show
the previous lines if they aren’t in your buffer? You guessed it: you need to
carry over at least as many lines that are required to satisfy a context
request from buffer to buffer.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a steep price to pay in terms of code complexity, but by golly, is it
worth it. You’ll need to read on to the benchmarks to discover when it is
faster than memory maps!</p>
<h3 id="printing">Printing</h3>
<p>It might seem like printing is such a trivial step, but it must be done with at
least some care. For example, you can’t just print matches from each search
thread as you find them, because you really don’t want to interleave the search
results of one file with the search results of another file. A naive approach
to this is to serialize the printer so that only one thread can print to it at
a time. This is problematic though, because if a search thread acquires a lock
to the printer before starting the search (and not releasing it until it has
finished searching one file), you’ll end up also serializing every search as
well, effectively defeating your entire approach to parallelism.</p>
<p>All code search tools in this benchmark that parallelize search therefore write
results to some kind of intermediate buffer <em>in memory</em>. This enables all of
the search threads to actually perform a search in parallel. The printing still
needs to be serialized, but we’ve reduced that down to simply dumping the
contents of the intermediate buffer to <code>stdout</code>. Using an in memory buffer
might set off alarm bells: what if you search a 2GB file and every line
matches? Doesn’t that lead to excessive memory usage? The answer is: “Why,
yes, indeed it does!” The key insight is that the common case is returning far
fewer matches than there are total lines searched. Nevertheless, there are
ways to mitigate excessive memory usage. For example, if <code>ripgrep</code> is used to
search <code>stdin</code> or a single file, then it will write search results directly
to <code>stdout</code> and forgo the intermediate buffer because it just doesn’t need
it. (<code>ripgrep</code> should also do this when asked to <em>not</em> do any parallelism,
but I haven’t gotten to it yet.) In other words, pick two: space, time or
correctness.</p>
<p>Note that the details aren’t quite the same in every tool. Namely, while The
Silver Searcher and Universal Code Grep write matches as structured data to
memory (i.e., an array of <code>match</code> structs or something similar), both <code>git grep</code> and <code>ripgrep</code> write the actual output to a dynamically growable string
buffer in memory. While either approach does seem to be fast enough, <code>git grep</code>
and <code>ripgrep</code> have to do things this way because they support incremental
search where as The Silver Searcher always memory maps the entire file and
Universal Code Grep always reads the entire contents of the file into memory.
The latter approach can refer back to the file’s contents in memory when doing
the actual printing, where as neither <code>git grep</code> nor <code>ripgrep</code> can do that.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Coming up with a good and fair benchmark is <em>hard</em>, and I have assuredly made
some mistakes in doing so. In particular, there are so many variables to
control for that testing every possible permutation isn’t feasible. This means
that the benchmarks I’m presenting here are <em>curated</em>, and, given that I am the
author of one of the tools in the benchmark, they are therefore also <em>biased</em>.
Nevertheless, even if I fail in my effort to provide a fair benchmark suite, I
do hope that some of you may find my analysis interesting, which will try to
explain the results in each benchmark. The analysis is in turn heavily biased
toward explaining my own work, since that is the implementation I’m most
familiar with. I have, however, read at least part of the source code of every
tool I benchmark, including their underlying regex engines.</p>
<p>In other words, I’m pretty confident that I’ve gotten the <em>details</em> correct,
but I could have missed something in the bigger picture. Because of that, let’s
go over some important insights that guided construction of this benchmark.</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on the problem that an <em>end user</em> is trying to solve. For example, we
split the entire benchmark in two: one for searching a large directory of
files and one for searching a single large file. The former might correspond
to an end user searching their code while the latter might correspond to an
end user searching logs. As we will see, these two use cases have markedly
different performance characteristics. A tool that is good at one isn’t
necessarily good at the other. (The premise of <code>ripgrep</code> is that it is
possible to be good at both!)</li>
<li>Apply <em>end user</em> problems more granularly as well. For example, most
searches result in few hits relative to the corpus searched, so prefer
benchmarks that report few matches. Another example: I hypothesize, based on
my own experience, that most searches use patterns that are simple literals,
alternations or very light regexes, so bias the benchmarks towards those
types of patterns.</li>
<li>Almost every search tool has slightly different default behavior, and these
behavioral changes can have an impact on performance. There is some value in
looking at “out-of-the-box” performance, and we therefore do look at a
benchmark for that, but stopping there is a bit unsatisfying. If our goal is
to do a <em>fair</em> comparison, then we need to at least try to convince each tool
to do roughly the same work, <strong>from the perspective of an end user</strong>. A good
example of this is reporting line numbers. Some tools don’t provide a way of
disabling line counting, so when doing comparisons between tools that do, we
need to explicitly enable line numbers. This is important, because counting
lines can be quite costly! A good <em>non-example</em> of this is if one tool uses
memory maps and another uses an intermediate buffer. This is an
implementation choice, and not one that alters what the user actually sees,
therefore comparing those two implementation choices in a benchmark is
completely fair (assuming an analysis that points it out).</li>
</ul>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s get into the nitty gritty. First and foremost,
what tools are we benchmarking?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code> (rg)</a> (v0.1.2) - You’ve
heard enough about this one already.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/">GNU grep</a> (v2.25) - Ol’ reliable.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html">git grep</a>
(v2.7.4) -
Like <code>grep</code>, but built into <code>git</code>. Only works well in <code>git</code> repositories.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">The Silver Searcher (ag)</a>
(commit <code>cda635</code>, using PCRE 8.38) - Like <code>ack</code>, but written in C and much
faster. Reads your <code>.gitignore</code> files just like <code>ripgrep</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gvansickle/ucg">Universal Code Grep (ucg)</a> (commit
<code>487bfb</code>, using PCRE 10.21 <strong>with the JIT enabled</strong>) - Also like <code>ack</code> but
written in C++, and only searches files from a whitelist, and doesn’t support
reading <code>.gitignore</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher">The Platinum Searcher
(pt)</a> (commit
<code>509368</code>) - Written in Go and does support <code>.gitignore</code> files.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/svent/sift">sift</a> (commit <code>2d175c</code>) - Written in Go and
supports <code>.gitignore</code> files with an optional flag, but generally prefers
searching everything (unlike every other tool in this list except for
<code>grep</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Notably absent from this list is <code>ack</code>. I chose not to benchmark it because,
at the time of writing, <code>ack</code> was much slower than the other tools in this
list. However, <a href="https://beyondgrep.com/ack3/">ack 3 is now in beta</a> and
includes some performance improvements, sometimes decreasing search times by
half.</p>
<h3 id="benchmark-runner">Benchmark runner</h3>
<p>The benchmark runner is a Python program (requires at least Python 3.5) that
you can use to not only run the benchmarks themselves, but download the corpora
used in the benchmarks as well. The script is called <code>benchsuite</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/benchsuite/benchsuite">is in the <code>ripgrep</code>
repository</a>.
You can use it like so:</p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>$ git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
</span></span><span><span>$ <span>cd</span> ripgrep/benchsuite

<p>If you don’t have all of the code search tools used in the benchmarks, then
pass <code>--allow-missing</code> to give <code>benchsuite</code> permission to skip running them. To
save the raw data (the timing for every command run), pass <code>--raw /path/to/raw.csv</code>.</p>
<p>The benchmark runner tries to do a few basic things for us to help reduce the
chance that we get misleading data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every benchmarked command is run three times before being measured as a
“warm up.” Specifically, this is to ensure that the corpora being searched
is already in the operating system’s page cache. If we didn’t do this, we
might end up benchmarking disk I/O, which is not only uninteresting for our
purposes, but is probably not a common end user scenario. It’s more likely
that you’ll be executing lots of searches against the same corpus (at least,
I know I do).</li>
<li>Every benchmarked command is run ten times, with a timing recorded for each
run. The final “result” of that command is its distribution (mean +/-
standard deviation). If I were a statistician, I could probably prove that
ten samples is insufficient. Nevertheless, getting more samples takes more
time, and for the most part, the variance is very low.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each individual benchmark definition is responsible for making sure each
command is trying to do similar work as other commands we’re comparing it to.
For example, we need to be careful to enable and disable Unicode support in GNU
grep where appropriate, because full Unicode handling can make GNU grep run
very slowly. Within each benchmark, there are often multiple variables of
interest. To account for this, I’ve added labels like <code>(ASCII)</code> or
<code>(whitelist)</code> where appropriate. We’ll dig into those labels in more detail
later.</p>
<p>Please also feel encouraged to add your own benchmarks if you’d like to play
around. The benchmarks are in the top-half of the file, and it should be fairly
straight-forward to copy &amp; paste another benchmark and modify it. Simply
defining a new benchmark will make it available. The second half of the script
is the runner itself and probably shouldn’t need to be modified.</p>
<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>The actual environment used to run the benchmarks presented in this article was
a <code>c3.2xlarge</code> instance on Amazon EC2. It ran Ubuntu 16.04, had a Xeon E5-2680
2.8 GHz CPU, 16 GB of memory and an 80 GB SSD (on which the corpora was
stored). This was enough memory to fit all of the corpora in memory. The box
was specifically provisioned for the purpose of running benchmarks, so it was
not doing anything else.</p>
<p>The full log of system setup and commands I used to install each of the search
tools and run benchmarks can be found
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/benchsuite/runs/2016-09-20-ubuntu1604-ec2/README.SETUP">here</a>.
I also captured the
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/benchsuite/runs/2016-09-20-ubuntu1604-ec2/summary">output of the bench runner (SPOILER ALERT)</a>
and the
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/benchsuite/runs/2016-09-20-ubuntu1604-ec2/raw.csv">raw output</a>,
which includes the timings, full set of command line arguments and any
environment variables set for every command run in every benchmark.</p>
<h2 id="code-search-benchmarks">Code search benchmarks</h2>
<p>This is the first half of our benchmarks, and corresponds to an <em>end user</em>
trying to search a large repository of code for a particular pattern.</p>
<p>The corpus used for this benchmark is a <em>built</em> checkout of the Linux kernel,
specifically commit <code>d0acc7</code>. We actually build the Linux kernel because the
process of building the kernel leaves a lot of garbage in the repository that
you probably don’t want to search. This can influence not only the relevance of
the results returned by a search tool, but the performance as well.</p>
<p>All benchmarks run in this section were run in the root of the repository.
Remember, you can see the full
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/benchsuite/runs/2016-09-20-ubuntu1604-ec2/raw.csv">raw results of each command</a>
if you like. The benchmark names correspond to the headings below.</p>
<p>Note that since these benchmarks were run on an EC2 instance, which uses a VM,
which in turn can penalize search tools that use memory maps, I’ve also
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/benchsuite/runs/2016-09-22-archlinux-cheetah/summary">recorded benchmarks on my local
machine</a>.
My local machine is an Intel i7-6900K 3.2 GHz, 16 CPUs, 64 GB memory and an
SSD. You’ll notice that <code>ag</code> does a lot better (but still worse than <code>rg</code>)
on my machine. Lest you think I’ve chosen results from the EC2 machine because
they paint <code>rg</code> more favorably, rest assured that I haven’t. Namely, <code>rg</code> wins
<em>every single benchmark</em> on my local machine except for <em>one</em>, where as <code>rg</code> is
beat out just slightly by a few tools on some benchmarks on the EC2 machine.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s start looking at benchmarks.</p>
<h3 id="linux_literal_default"><code>linux_literal_default</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This benchmark compares the time it takes to execute a simple
literal search using each tool’s default settings. This is an intentionally
unfair benchmark meant to highlight the differences between tools and their
“out-of-the-box” settings.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>*</code> - Best mean time.</li>
<li><code>+</code> - Best sample time.</li>
<li><code>rg == ripgrep</code>, <code>ag == The Silver Searcher</code>, <code>ucg == Universal Code Grep</code>,
<code>pt == The Platinum Searcher</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: We’ll first start by actually describing what each tool is doing:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rg</code> respects the Linux repo’s <code>.gitignore</code> files (of which there are
<code>178</code>(!) of them), and skips hidden and binary files. <code>rg</code> does not count
lines.</li>
<li><code>ag</code> has the same default behavior as <code>rg</code>, except it counts lines.</li>
<li><code>ucg</code> also counts lines, but does not attempt to read <code>.gitignore</code> files.
Instead, it only searches files from an (extensible) whitelist according
to a set of glob rules. For example, both <code>rg</code> and <code>ag</code> will search
<code>fs/jffs2/README.Locking</code> while <code>ucg</code> won’t, because it doesn’t recognize
the <code>Locking</code> extension. (A search tool probably <em>should</em> search that file,
although it does not impact the results of this specific benchmark.)</li>
<li><code>pt</code> has the same default behavior as <code>ag</code>.</li>
<li><code>sift</code> searches everything, including binary files and hidden files. It
<em>should</em> be equivalent to <code>grep -r</code>, for example. It also does not count
lines.</li>
<li><code>git grep</code> should have the same behavior at <code>rg</code>, and similarly does not
count lines. Note though that <code>git grep</code> has a special advantage: it does not
need to traverse the directory hierarchy. It can discover the set of files to
search straight from its git index.</li>
</ul>
<p>The high-order bit to extract from this benchmark is that a naive comparison
between search tools is completely unfair from the perspective of performance,
but is really important if you care about the <em>relevance</em> of results returned
to you. <code>sift</code>, like <code>grep -r</code>, will throw everything it can back at you, which
is totally at odds with the philosophy behind every other tool in this
benchmark: only return results that are <em>probably</em> relevant. Things inside your
<code>.git</code> probably aren’t, for example. (This isn’t to say that <code>sift</code>’s
philosophy is wrong. The tool is clearly intended to be configured by an end
user to their own tastes, which has its own pros and cons.)</p>
<p>With respect to performance, there are two key variables to pay attention to.
They will appear again and again throughout our benchmark:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counting lines <em>can be</em> quite expensive. A naive solution—a loop over every
byte and comparing it to a <code>\n</code>—will be quite slow for example.
<a href="https://github.com/gvansickle/ucg/blob/8bbebc002bbf112d147928f89677cba703d007bb/src/FileScanner_sse4_2.cpp#L190">Universal Code Grep counts lines using SIMD</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/919c5c72994edb378706594f6268542983eeee6d/src/search_stream.rs#L549"><code>ripgrep</code> counts lines using packed comparisons (16 bytes at a time)</a>.
However, in the Linux code search benchmarks, because the size of each
individual file is very small and the number of matches is tiny compared
to the corpus size, the time spent counting lines tends to not be so
significant. Especially since every tool in this benchmark parallelizes
search to some degree. When we get to the single-file benchmarks, this
variable will become much more pertinent.</li>
<li>Respecting <code>.gitignore</code> files incurs some amount of overhead. Even though
respecting <code>.gitignore</code> reduces the number of files searched, it can be
slower overall to actually read the patterns, compile them and match them
against every path than to just search every file. This is precisely how
<code>ucg</code> soundly beats <code>ripgrep</code> in this benchmark. (We will control for this
variable in future benchmarks.) In other words, respecting <code>.gitignore</code> is a
feature that improves <em>relevance</em> first and foremost. It is strictly a bonus
if it also happens to improve performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific reasons why supporting <code>.gitignore</code> leads to a slower overall
search are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every directory descended requires looking for a corresponding <code>.gitignore</code>.
Multiply the number of calls if you support additional ignore files, like
both The Silver Searcher and <code>ripgrep</code> do. The Linux kernel repository has
<code>4,640</code> directories. <code>178</code> of them have <code>.gitignore</code> files.</li>
<li>Each <code>.gitignore</code> file needs to be compiled into something that can match
file paths. Both The Silver Searcher and <code>ripgrep</code> use tricks to make this
faster. For example, simple patterns like <code>/vmlinux</code> or <code>*.o</code> can be matched
using simple literal comparisons or by looking at the file extension of a
candidate path and comparing it directly. For more complex patterns like
<code>*.c.[012]*.*</code>, a full glob matcher needs to be used. The Silver Searcher
uses <code>fnmatch</code> while <code>ripgrep</code> translates all such globs into a single
regular expression which can be matched against a single path all at once.
Doing all this work takes time.</li>
<li>Unlike <code>ag</code>, <code>rg</code> will try to support the full semantics of a <code>.gitignore</code>
file. This means finding <em>every</em> ignore pattern that matches a file path and
giving precedent to the most recently defined pattern. <code>ag</code> will bail on the
first match it sees.</li>
<li>Actually matching a path has non-trivial overhead that must be paid for
<em>every</em> path searched. The compilation phase described above is complex
precisely for making this part faster. We try to stay out of the regex
machinery as best we can, but we can’t avoid it completely.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, a whitelist like the one used by <code>ucg</code> is comparatively easy to
make fast. The set of globs is known upfront, so no additional checks need to
be made while traversing the file tree. Moreover, the globs tend to be of the
<code>*.ext</code> variety, which fall into the bucket of globs that can be matched
efficiently just by looking at the extension of a file path.</p>
<p>The downside of a whitelist is obvious: you might end up missing search results
simply because <code>ucg</code> didn’t know about a particular file extension. You could
always teach <code>ucg</code> about the file extension, but you’re still blind to “unknown
unknowns” (i.e., files that you probably want to search but didn’t know upfront
that you needed to).</p>
<h3 id="linux_literal"><code>linux_literal</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This benchmark runs the same query as in the
<a href="#linux-literal-default"><code>linux_literal_default</code></a>
benchmark, but we try to do a fair comparison. In particular, we run <code>ripgrep</code>
in two modes: one where it respects <code>.gitignore</code> files (corresponding to
the <code>(ignore)</code> label) and one where it uses a whitelist and doesn’t respect
<code>.gitignore</code> (corresponding to the <code>(whitelist)</code> label). The former mode is
comparable to <code>ag</code>, <code>pt</code>, <code>sift</code> and <code>git grep</code>, while the latter mode is
comparable to <code>ucg</code>. We also run <code>rg</code> a third time by explicitly telling it
to use memory maps for search, which matches the implementation strategy used
by <code>ag</code>. <code>sift</code> is run such that it respects <code>.gitignore</code> files and excludes
binary, hidden and PDF files. All commands executed here count lines, because
some commands (<code>ag</code> and <code>ucg</code>) don’t support disabling line counting.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern</strong>: <code>PM_RESUME</code></p>

<ul>
<li><code>*</code> - Best mean time.</li>
<li><code>+</code> - Best sample time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: We have a ton of ground to cover on this one.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the <code>(ignore)</code> vs. <code>(whitelist)</code> variables have a clear
impact on the performance of <code>rg</code>. We won’t rehash all the details from the
analysis in
<a href="#linux-literal-default"><code>linux_literal_default</code></a>,
but switching <code>rg</code> into its whitelist mode brings it into a dead heat with
<code>ucg</code>.</p>
<p>Secondly, <code>ucg</code> is just as fast as <code>ripgrep</code> and <code>git grep (ignore)</code> is just as
fast as <code>rg (ignore)</code>, even though I’ve said that
<code>ripgrep</code> is the fastest. It turns out that <code>ucg</code>, <code>git grep</code> and <code>rg</code> are
pretty evenly matched when searching for plain literals in large repositories.
We will see a stronger separation in later benchmarks. Still, what makes <code>ucg</code>
fast?</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ucg</code> reads the entire file into memory before searching it, which means it
avoids the memory map problem described below. On a code repository, this
approach works well, but it comes with a steep price in the single-file
benchmarks.</li>
<li>It has a fast explicitly SIMD based line counting algorithm. <code>ripgrep</code> has
something similar, but relies on the compiler for autovectorization.</li>
<li><code>ucg</code> uses PCRE2’s JIT, which is <em>insanely</em> fast. In my own very rough
benchmarks, PCRE2’s JIT is one of the few general purpose regex engines that
is competitive with Rust’s regex engine (on regexes that don’t expose PCRE’s
exponential behavior due to backtracking, since Rust’s regex engine doesn’t
suffer from that weakness).</li>
<li><code>ucg</code> parallelizes directory traversal, which is something that <code>ripgrep</code>
doesn’t do. <code>ucg</code> has it a bit easier here because it doesn’t support
<code>.gitignore</code> files. Parallelizing directory traversal while maintaining state
for <code>.gitignore</code> files in a way that scales isn’t a problem I’ve figured out
how to cleanly solve yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about <code>git grep</code>? A key performance advantage of <code>git grep</code> is that it
doesn’t need to walk the directory tree, which can save it quite a bit of time.
Its regex engine is also quite fast, and works similarly to GNU grep’s, RE2 and
Rust’s regex engine (i.e., it uses a DFA).</p>
<p>Both <code>sift</code> and <code>pt</code> perform almost as well as <code>ripgrep</code>. In fact, both <code>sift</code>
and <code>pt</code> do implement a parallel recursive directory traversal while
still respecting <code>.gitignore</code> files, which is likely one reason for their
speed. As we will see in future benchmarks, their speed here is misleading.
Namely, they are fast because they stay outside of Go’s regexp engine since the
pattern is a literal. (There will be more discussion on this point later.)</p>
<p>Finally, what’s going on with The Silver Searcher? Is it really that much
slower than everything else? The key here is that its use of memory maps is
making it <em>slower</em>, not faster (in direct contradiction to the claims in its
README).</p>
<p>OK, let’s pause and pop up a level to talk about what this actually means.
First, we need to consider how these search tools fundamentally work. Generally
speaking, a search tool like this has two ways of actually searching files on
disk:</p>
<ol>
<li>It can memory map the file and search the entire file all at once <em>as if</em> it
were a single contiguous region of bytes in memory. The operating system
does the work behind the scenes to make a file look like a contiguous
region of memory. This particular approach is <em>really</em> convenient when
comparing it to the alternative described next.</li>
<li>… or it can allocate an intermediate buffer, read a fixed size block of
bytes from the file into it, search the buffer and then repeat the process.
This particular approach is absolutely ghoulish to implement, because you
need to account for the fact that a buffer may end in the middle of the
line. You also need to account for the fact that a single line may exceed
the size of your buffer. Finally, if you’re going to support showing the
lines around a match (its “context”) as both <code>grep</code> and <code>ripgrep</code> do, then
you need to do additional bookkeeping to make sure any lines from a previous
buffer are printed even if a match occurs at the beginning of the next block
read from the file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Naively, it seems like (1) would be <em>obviously</em> faster. Surely, all of the
bookkeeping and copying in (2) would make it much slower! In fact, this is not
at all true. (1) may not require much bookkeeping from the perspective of the
programmer, but there is a lot of <a href="http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0004.0/0728.html">bookkeeping going on inside the
Linux kernel to maintain the memory
map</a>. (That link
goes to a mailing list post that is quite old, but it still appears relevant
today.)</p>
<p>When I first started writing <code>ripgrep</code>, I used the memory map approach. It took
me a long time to be convinced enough to start down the second path with an
intermediate buffer (because neither a CPU profile nor the output of <code>strace</code>
ever showed any convincing evidence that memory maps were to blame), but as
soon as I had a prototype of (2) working, it was clear that it was much faster
than the memory map approach.</p>
<p>With all that said, memory maps aren’t all bad. They just happen to be bad for
the particular use case of “rapidly open, scan and close memory maps for
thousands of small files.” For a different use case, like, say, “open this
large file and search it once,” memory maps turn out to be a boon. We’ll see
that in action in our single-file benchmarks later.</p>
<p>The key datapoint that supports this conclusion is the comparison between
<code>rg (ignore)</code> and <code>rg (ignore) (mmap)</code>. In particular, this controls for
everything <em>except</em> for the search strategy and fairly conclusively points
right at memory maps as the problem.</p>
<p>With all that said, the performance of memory maps is very dependent on your
environment, and the absolute difference between <code>rg (ignore)</code> and <code>ag (ignore) (mmap)</code> can be misleading. In particular, since these benchmarks were run on an
EC2 <code>c3.2xlarge</code>, we were probably inside a virtual machine, which could
feasibly impact memory map performance. To test this, I ran the same benchmark
on my machine under my desk (Intel i7-6900K 3.2 GHz, 16 CPUs, 64 GB memory,
SSD) and got these results:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>*</code> - Best mean time.</li>
<li><code>+</code> - Best sample time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: The biggest change from the previous benchmark is that <code>pt</code> got
an order of magnitude slower than the next slowest tool.</p>
<p>So why did <code>pt</code> get so slow? In particular, both <code>sift</code> and <code>pt</code> use Go’s
<code>regexp</code> package for searching, so why did one perish while the other only got
slightly slower? It turns out that when <code>pt</code> sees the <code>-i</code> flag indicating case
insensitive search, it will force itself to use Go’s <code>regexp</code> engine with the
<code>i</code> flag set. So for example, given a CLI invocation of <code>pt -i foo</code>, it will
translate that to a Go regexp of <code>(?i)foo</code>, which will handle the case
insensitive search.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <code>sift</code> will notice the <code>-i</code> flag and take a different route.
<code>sift</code> will lowercase both the pattern and every block of bytes it searches.
This filter over all the bytes searched is likely the cause of <code>sift</code>’s
performance drop from the previous
<a href="#linux-literal"><code>linux_literal</code></a>
benchmark. (It’s worth pointing out that this optimization is actually
incorrect, because it only accounts for ASCII case insensitivity, and not full
Unicode case insensitivity, which <code>pt</code> gets by virture of Go’s regexp engine.)</p>
<p>But still, is Go’s regexp engine really that slow? Unfortunately, yes, it is.
While Go’s regexp engine takes worst case linear time on all searches (and is
therefore exponentially faster than even PCRE2 for some set of regexes and
corpora), its actual implementation hasn’t quite matured yet. Indeed, every
<em>fast</em> regex engine based on finite automata that I’m aware of implements
some kind of DFA engine. For example, GNU grep, Google’s RE2 and Rust’s regex
library all do this. Go’s does not (but there is work in progress to make this
happen, so perhaps <code>pt</code> will get faster on this benchmark without having to do
anything at all!).</p>
<p>There is one other thing worth noting here before moving on. Namely, that <code>rg</code>,
<code>ag</code>, <code>git grep</code> and <code>ucg</code> didn’t noticeably change much from the previous
benchmark. Shouldn’t a case insensitive search incur some kind of overhead? The
answer is complicated and actually requires more knowledge of the underlying
regex engines than I have. Thankfully, I can at least answer it for Rust’s
regex engine.</p>
<p>The key insight is that a case insensitive search for <code>PM_RESUME</code> is precisely
the same as a case sensitive search of the alternation of all possible case
agnostic versions of <code>PM_RESUME</code>. So for example, it might start like:
<code>PM_RESUME|pM_RESUME|Pm_RESUME|PM_rESUME|...</code> and so on. Of course, the
full alternation, even for a small literal like this, would be <em>quite</em> large.
The key is that we can extract a small prefix and enumerate all of <em>its</em>
combinations quite easily. In this case, Rust’s regex engine figures out this
alternation (which you can see by passing <code>--debug</code> to <code>rg</code> and examining
<code>stderr</code>):</p>

<p>(Rest assured that Unicode support is baked into this process. For example, a
case insensitive search for <code>S</code> would yield the following literals: <code>S</code>, <code>s</code>
and <code>ſ</code>.)</p>
<p>Now that we have this alternation of literals, what do we do with them? The
classical answer is to compile them into a DFA
(perhaps <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/aho-corasick">Aho-Corasick</a>),
and use it as a way to quickly skip through the search text. A match of any of
the literals would then cause the regex engine to activate and try to verify
the match. This way, we aren’t actually running the entire search text through
the regex engine, which could be quite a bit slower.</p>
<p>But, Rust’s regex engine doesn’t actually use Aho-Corasick for this. When SIMD
acceleration is enabled (and you can be sure it is for these benchmarks, and
for the binaries I distribute), a special multiple pattern search algorithm
called Teddy is used. The algorithm is unpublished, but was invented by
Geoffrey Langdale as part of <a href="https://github.com/01org/hyperscan">Intel’s Hyperscan regex
library</a>. The algorithm works roughly by
using packed comparisons of 16 bytes at a time to find candidate locations
where a literal might match.
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/blob/master/src/simd_accel/teddy128.rs">I adapted the algorithm from the Hyperscan project to
Rust</a>,
and included an extensive write up in the comments if you’re interested.</p>
<p>While Teddy doesn’t buy us much over other tools in this particular benchmark,
we will see much larger wins in later benchmarks.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>*</code> - Best mean time.</li>
<li><code>+</code> - Best sample time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: Not much has changed between this benchmark and the previous
<a href="#linux-literal"><code>linux_literal</code></a>
or
<a href="#linux-literal-casei"><code>linux_literal_casei</code></a>
benchmarks. The most important thing to note is that most search tools handle
the <code>-w</code> flag just fine without any noticeable drop in performance. There are
two additional things I’d like to note.</p>
<p><code>rg</code> is searching with Unicode aware word boundaries where as the rest of the
tools are using ASCII only word boundaries. (<code>git grep</code> can be made to use
Unicode word boundaries by adjusting your system’s locale settings. In this
benchmark, we force it to use ASCII word boundaries.)</p>
<p><code>sift</code> and <code>pt</code> are the only tools that gets noticeably slower in this
benchmark compared to previous benchmarks. The reason is the same as the reason
why <code>pt</code> got noticeably slower in the
<a href="#linux-literal-casei"><code>linux_literal_casei</code></a>
benchmark: both <code>pt</code> and <code>sift</code> are now also bottlenecked on Go’s regexp
library. <code>pt</code> and <code>sift</code> could do a little better here by staying out of
Go’s regexp library and searching for the <code>PM_RESUME</code> literal, and then only
confirming whether the match corresponds to a word boundary after it found a
hit for <code>PM_RESUME</code>. This still might use Go’s regexp library, but in a much
more limited form.</p>
<h3 id="linux_unicode_word"><code>linux_unicode_word</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This benchmarks a simple query for all prefixed forms of the
“amp-hour” (Ah) unit of measurement. For example, it should show things like
<code>mAh</code> (for milliamp-hour) and <code>µAh</code> (for microamp-hour). It is particularly
interesting because the second form starts with <code>µ</code>, which is part of a Unicode
aware <code>\w</code> character class, but not an ASCII-only <code>\w</code> character class. We
again continue to control for the overhead of respecting <code>.gitignore</code> files.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: In this benchmark, we’ve introduced a new variable: whether or
not to enable Unicode support in each tool. Searches that are Unicode aware
report slightly more matches that are missed by the other ASCII only searches.</p>
<p>Of all the tools here, the only ones that support Unicode toggling are <code>rg</code>
and <code>git grep</code>. <code>rg</code>’s Unicode support can be toggled by setting a flag in
the pattern itself (e.g., <code>\w</code> is Unicode aware while <code>(?-u)\w</code> is not), and
<code>git grep</code>’s Unicode suport can be toggled by setting the <code>LC_ALL</code> environment
variable (where <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> is one way to enable Unicode support and <code>C</code>
forces it to be ASCII). More generally, <code>git grep</code>’s Unicode support is
supposed to line up with your system’s locale settings—setting <code>LC_ALL</code> is a
bit of a hack.</p>
<p>It gets a little worse than that actually. Not only are <code>rg</code> and <code>git grep</code> the
only ones to support toggling Unicode, but they are the only ones to support
Unicode <em>at all</em>. <code>ag</code>, <code>pt</code>, <code>sift</code> and <code>ucg</code> will all force you to use the
ASCII only <code>\w</code> character class. (For <code>pt</code> and <code>sift</code> in particular, Go’s
<code>regexp</code> library doesn’t have the ability to treat <code>\w</code> as Unicode aware. For
<code>ag</code> and <code>ucg</code>, which use PCRE, <code>\w</code> could be made Unicode aware with a flag
sent to PCRE. Neither tool exposes that functionality though.)</p>
<p>The key result to note here is that while <code>git grep</code> suffers a major
performance hit for enabling Unicode support, <code>ripgrep</code> hums along just fine
with no noticeable loss in performance, even though both <code>rg (ignore)</code> and <code>git grep (ignore)</code> report the same set of results.</p>
<p>As in the previous benchmark, both <code>pt</code> and <code>sift</code> could do better here by
searching for the <code>Ah</code> literal, and only using Go’s regexp library to verify a
match.)</p>
<p>Looking at the benchmark results, I can think of two important questions to
ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why is <code>git grep (ignore) (ASCII)</code> so much slower than
<code>rg (ignore) (ASCII)</code>? And while the two aren’t directly comparable,
it’s also a lot slower than <code>ucg (ASCII)</code>.</li>
<li>How is <code>rg (ignore)</code> (which is Unicode aware) just as fast as
<code>rg (ignore) (ASCII)</code>?</li>
</ol>
<p>I actually don’t have a great answer for (1). In the case of <code>rg</code> at least,
it will extract the <code>Ah</code> literal suffix from the regex and use that to find
candidate matches before running the <code>\w</code> prefix. While GNU grep has
sophisticated literal extraction as well, it looks like <code>git grep</code> doesn’t go
to similar lengths to extract literals. (I’m arriving at this conclusion after
skimming the source of <code>git grep</code>, so I could be wrong.)</p>
<p>In the case of <code>ucg</code>, it’s likely that PCRE2 is doing a similar literal
optimization that <code>rg</code> is doing.</p>
<p>(2) is fortunately much easier to answer. The trick is not inside of <code>rg</code>, but
inside its regex library. Namely, the regex engine <em>builds UTF-8 decoding into
its finite state machine</em>. (This is a trick that is originally attributed to
Ken Thompson, but was more carefully
<a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp3.html">described by Russ Cox</a>.
To read more about how this is achieved in Rust’s regex engine, please see the
<a href="https://docs.rs/utf8-ranges"><code>utf8-ranges</code></a>
library.) The reason why this is fast is because there is no extra decoding
step required. The regex can be matched directly against UTF-8 encoded byte
strings one byte at a time. Invalid UTF-8 doesn’t pose any problems: the finite
automaton simply won’t match it because it doesn’t recognize it.</p>
<p>In contrast, <code>git grep</code> (and GNU grep) have a completely separate path in their
core matching code for handling Unicode aware features like this. To be fair,
<code>git grep</code> can handle text encodings other than UTF-8, where as <code>rg</code> is limited
to UTF-8 (or otherwise “ASCII compatible” text encodings) at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: This benchmark doesn’t reveal anything particularly new that we
haven’t already learned from previous benchmarks. In particular, both <code>rg</code> and
<code>ucg</code> continue to be competitive, <code>pt</code> and <code>sift</code> are getting bottlenecked by
Go’s regexp library and <code>git grep</code> has a slow down similar to the one observed
in
<a href="#linux-unicode-word"><code>linux_unicode_word</code></a>.
(My hypothesis for that slow down continues to be that <code>git grep</code> is missing
the literal optimization.) Finally, <code>ag</code> continues to be held back by its use
of memory maps.</p>
<p><code>rg</code>, and almost assuredly <code>ucg</code> (by virtue of PCRE2), are picking on the
<code>_RESUME</code> literal suffix and searching for that instead of running the regex
over the entire search text. This explains why both tools are able to maintain
their speed even as the pattern gets slightly more complex. <code>rg</code> does seem to
slightly edge out <code>ucg</code> here, which might be attributable to differences in how
each underlying regex library does literal search.</p>

<li>We drop <code>pt</code> and <code>sift</code> from this benchmark and the next one for expediency.

around an order of magnitude slower than the next slowest tool. Neither get
any better as the complexity of our patterns increase.</li>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: Yet again, both <code>rg</code> and <code>ucg</code> maintain high speed even as the
pattern grows beyond a simple literal. In this case, there isn’t any <em>one</em>
particular literal that we can search to find match candidates quickly, but a
good regular expression engine can still find ways to speed this up.</p>
<p>For <code>rg</code> in particular, it sees the four literals and diverts to the Teddy
multiple pattern SIMD algorithm (as described in the
<a href="#linux-literal-casei"><code>linux_literal_casei</code></a>
benchmark). In fact, for this particular pattern, Rust’s core regex engine
is never used at all. Namely, it notices that a literal match of any of the
alternates corresponds to an overall match of the pattern, so it can completely
skip the verification step. This makes searching alternates of literals <em>very</em>
fast.</p>
<h3 id="linux_alternates_casei"><code>linux_alternates_casei</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This benchmark is precisely the same as the

Note that <code>git grep</code> is run under ASCII mode, in order to give it every chance
to be fast.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: The case insensitive flag causes quite a bit of separation,
relative to the previous
<a href="#linux-alternates"><code>linux_alterates</code></a>
benchmark. For one, <code>git grep</code> gets over 4 times slower. Even <code>ucg</code> gets twice
as slow. Yet, <code>rg</code> continues to maintain its speed!</p>
<p>The secret continues to be the Teddy algorithm, just as in the
<a href="#linux-alternates"><code>linux_alternates</code></a>
benchmark. The trick lies in how we transform an alternation of <em>case
insensitive</em> literals into a larger alternation that the Teddy algorithm
can actually use. In fact, it works exactly how it was described in the
<a href="#linux-literal-casei"><code>linux_literal_casei</code></a>
benchmark: we enumerate all possible alternations of each literal that are
required for case insensitive match. Since that can be quite a large number,
we limit ourselves to a small number of prefixes from that set that we can
enumerate. In this case, we use the following prefixes (which can be seen by
running <code>rg</code> with the <code>--debug</code> flag):</p>

<p>We feed these literals to the Teddy algorithm, which will quickly identify
<em>candidate</em> matches in the search text. When a candidate match is found, we
need to verify it since a match of a prefix doesn’t necessarily mean the entire
pattern matches. It is only at that point that we actually invoke the full
regex engine.</p>
<h3 id="linux_unicode_greek"><code>linux_unicode_greek</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This benchmarks usage of a particular Unicode feature that
permits one to match a certain class of codepoints defined in Unicode. Both
Rust’s regex engine and Go’s regex engine support this natively, but none of
the other tools do.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: This one is pretty simple. <code>rg</code> compiles <code>\p{Greek}</code> into a
deterministic finite state machine while Go (used in <code>pt</code> and <code>sift</code>) will also
use a finite state machine, but it is a <em>nondeterministic</em> simulation. The core
difference between the two approaches is that the former is only ever in one
state at any point in time, while the latter must constantly keep track of all
the different states it is in.</p>
<h3 id="linux_unicode_greek_casei"><code>linux_unicode_greek_casei</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This benchmark is just like the
<a href="#linux-unicode-greek"><code>linux_unicode_greek</code></a>
benchmark, except it makes the search case insensitive. This particular query
is a bit idiosyncratic, but it does demonstrate just how well supported Unicode
is in <code>rg</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern</strong>: <code>\p{Greek}</code> (with the <code>-i</code> flag set, matches any Greek symbol)</p>

<ul>
<li><code>*</code> - Best mean time.</li>
<li><code>+</code> - Best sample time.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: <code>sift</code> doesn’t actually beat <code>rg</code> here: it just gets so confused
by the search request that it gives up and reports no matches. <code>pt</code> seems to
execute the search, but doesn’t handle Unicode case insensitivity correctly.
Meanwhile, <code>rg</code> handles the request just fine, <em>and it’s still fast</em>.</p>
<p>In this particular case, the entire <code>Greek</code> category, along with all of its
case-insensitive variants, are compiled into a single fast deterministic finite
state machine.</p>
<p>One interesting thing to note about this search is that if you run it, you’ll
see a lot more results containing the character <code>µ</code>, which looks essentially
identical to the character <code>μ</code> that also shows up in a case sensitive search.
As you might have guessed, even though these two characters look the same, they
are in fact distinct Unicode codepoints:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>µ</code> is <code>MICRO SIGN</code> with codepoint <code>U+000000B5</code>.</li>
<li><code>μ</code> is <code>GREEK SMALL LETTER MU</code> with codepoint <code>U+000003BC</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter codepoint is considered part of the <code>\p{Greek}</code> group while the
former codepoint is not (the former codepoint appears to be the correct sigil
to use in the case of the Linux kernel). However, the
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/CaseFolding.txt">Unicode simple case folding
tables</a>
map <code>MICRO SIGN</code> to <code>GREEK SMALL LETTER MU</code>, which causes <code>rg</code> to pick up on
lines containing <code>MICRO SIGN</code> even though it strictly isn’t part of the <code>Greek</code>
group.</p>
<h3 id="linux_no_literal"><code>linux_no_literal</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This is the last benchmark on the Linux kernel source code and

<a href="#linux-unicode-greek-casei"><code>linux_unicode_greek_casei</code></a>.
In particular, it looks for lines containing 5 consecutive repetitions of
5 word characters, each separated by one or more space characters. The key
distinction of this pattern from every other pattern in this benchmark is that
it does not contain any literals. Given the presence of <code>\w</code> and <code>\s</code>, which
have valid Unicode and ASCII interpretations, we attempt to control for the
presence of Unicode support.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: Since this particular pattern doesn’t have any literals in it,
it’s entirely up to the underlying regex engine to answer this query. It can’t
be smart and skip through the input—it has to pass it completely through the
regex engine. Since non-literal patterns are pretty rare in my experience, this
benchmark exists primarily as an engineered way to test how well the underlying
regex engines perform.</p>
<p><code>rg</code>, regardless of whether it respects <code>.gitignore</code> files or whether it
handles Unicode correctly, does quite well here compared to other tools. <code>git grep</code> in particular pays a 5x penalty for Unicode support. <code>rg</code> on the other
hand pays about a 0.3x penalty for Unicode support. Interestingly, even though
<code>ucg</code> doesn’t enable Unicode support, not even PCRE2’s JIT can compete with
<code>rg</code>!</p>
<p>What makes <code>rg</code> so fast here? And what actually causes the 0.3x penalty?</p>
<p><code>rg</code> continues to be fast on this benchmark primarily for the same reason why
it’s fast with other Unicode-centric benchmarks: it compiles the UTF-8 decoding
right into its deterministic finite state machine. This means there is no extra
step to decode the search text into Unicode codepoints first. We can match
directly on the raw bytes.</p>
<p>To a first approximation, the performance penalty comes from compiling the DFA
to match the pattern. In particular, the DFA to match the Unicode variant is
much much larger than the DFA to match the ASCII variant. To give you a rough
idea of the size difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ASCII DFA has about <strong>250</strong> distinct NFA states.</li>
<li>The Unicode DFA has about <strong>77,000</strong> distinct NFA states.</li>
</ul>
<p>(These numbers are produced directly from the compiler in Rust’s regex library,
and don’t necessarily reflect a minimal automaton.)</p>
<p>A DFA produced from these patterns doesn’t necessarily have the same number of
states, since each DFA state typically corresponds to multiple NFA states.
(Check out the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerset_construction">Powerset construction</a>
Wikipedia article. Although it doesn’t correspond to the same implementation
strategy used in Rust’s regex engine, it should give good intuition.)</p>
<p>However, the first approximation is a bit misleading. While Rust’s regex engine
does have a preprocessing compilation phase, it does not actually include
converting an NFA into a DFA. Indeed, that would be far too slow and could
take exponential time! Instead, Rust’s regex engine builds the DFA <em>on the fly</em>
or “lazily,” as it searches the text. In the case of the ASCII pattern, this
search barely spends any time constructing the DFA states since there are so
few of them. However, in the Unicode case, since there are so many NFA states,
it winds up spending a lot of time compiling new DFA states. (I’ve confirmed
this by inspecting a profile generated by
<a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><code>perf</code></a>.)
Digging a bit deeper, the actual story here might be subtler. For example, the
Unicode pattern might wind up with the same number of DFA states as the ASCII
pattern, primarily because the input its searching is the same and is primarily
ASCII. The slow down then must come from the fact that each individual DFA
state takes longer to build. This is likely correct since a single Unicode <code>\w</code>
is over two orders of magnitude larger than a single ASCII <code>\w</code>. Therefore,
each DFA state probably has a lot more NFA states in it for the Unicode pattern
as opposed to the ASCII pattern. It’s not clear whether we can do any better
here (other than trying to minimize the Unicode <code>\w</code>, which would be totally
feasible), since we don’t actually know the composition of the search text
ahead of time.</p>
<p>One idea for improvement is to have multiple types of DFAs. For example,
you might imagine trying to match with an ASCII only DFA. If the DFA sees a
non-ASCII byte, then it could cause a transition into a Unicode-aware DFA.
However, the penalty here is so small that it’s hard to justify this kind of
implementation complexity!</p>
<h2 id="single-file-benchmarks">Single file benchmarks</h2>
<p>In the second half of our benchmarks, we will shift gears and look more closely
at the performance of search tools on a single large file. Each benchmark will
be run on two samples of the
<a href="http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/OpenSubtitles2016.php">OpenSubtitles2016</a> dataset.
One sample will be English and therefore predominantly ASCII, and another
sample will be in Russian and therefore predominantly Cyrillic. The patterns
for the Russian sample were translated from English using Google Translate.
(Sadly, I can’t read Russian, but I have tried each search by hand and
confirmed that a sample of the results I was looking at were relevant by piping
them back through Google Translate.) The English sample is around 1GB and
the Russian sample is around 1.6GB, so the benchmark timings aren’t directly
comparable.</p>
<p>In this benchmark, the performance of the underlying regex engine and various
literal optimizations matter a lot more. The two key variables we’ll need to
control for are line counting and Unicode support. Normally, we’d just not
request line counting from any of the tools, but neither of The Silver Searcher
or Universal Code Grep support disabling line numbers. Additionally, Unicode
support is tricky to control for in some examples because <code>ripgrep</code> does not
support ASCII only case insensitive semantics when searching with a non-ASCII
string. It’s Unicode all the way and there’s no way to turn it off. As we’ll
see, at least for <code>ripgrep</code>, it’s still faster than its ASCII alternatives even
when providing case insensitive Unicode support.</p>
<p>As with the Linux benchmark, you can see precisely which command was run and
its recorded time in
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/benchsuite/runs/2016-09-20-ubuntu1604-ec2/raw.csv">the raw data</a>.</p>
<p><code>ripgrep</code> utterly dominates this round, both in performance <em>and</em> correctness.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>*</code> - Best mean time.</li>
<li><code>+</code> - Best sample time.</li>
<li>This is the only benchmark that contains <code>pt</code> and <code>sift</code>, since they become
too slow in all future benchmarks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: Whether it’s part of the underlying regex engine or part of the
search tool itself, every search tool in this benchmark does some kind of
literal optimization. <code>ag</code> will inspect the pattern, and if it doesn’t
contain any special regex characters, then it will use a Boyer-Moore variant
to perform the search instead of PCRE. GNU grep does something similar,
although it has clearly been the
<a href="http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/old-age-and-treachery.html">subject of much
optimization</a>.</p>
<p>If that’s true, how does <code>rg</code> beat GNU grep by almost a factor of 2? Well,
first and foremost, we note that both <code>sift</code> and <code>ucg</code> beat GNU grep as well.
I won’t be able to go into detail on <code>ucg</code>’s speed since PCRE2’s JIT isn’t
something I understand very well, but I can at least tell you that the reasons
why <code>rg</code> and <code>sift</code> are faster than GNU grep are actually distinct:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sift</code> uses Go’s regexp library, which will do at least one small literal
optimization: if every match of a regex starts with the same byte, the regex
engine will scan for that byte before starting a match. If you follow the
code that does the scan for the byte all the way back to its source for
<code>x86_64</code> systems, then you’ll find that it is using
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b851ded09a300033849b60ab47a468087ce557a1/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s#L1394-L1413">AVX2 instructions and <code>ymm</code>
registers</a>,
which permit scanning 32 bytes in each iteration. In contrast, GNU grep uses
<code>libc</code>’s <code>memchr</code>, which
<a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/x86_64/memrchr.S;h=840de30cd71ba96b3ae43540e6ac255c28906cc5;hb=HEAD">doesn’t use AVX2</a>.
However, that C code will be autovectorized to use <code>xmm</code> registers and SIMD
instructions, which are half the size of <code>ymm</code> registers. In other words, by
virture of being written in Go, <code>sift</code> is making more efficient use of the
CPU.</li>
<li><code>rg</code> also uses <code>memchr</code> from <code>libc</code>. The <code>rg</code> binary that was used in this
benchmark was statically linked with
<a href="http://www.musl-libc.org"><code>musl</code></a>,
which provides its own
<a href="https://github.com/ifduyue/musl/blob/master/src/string/memchr.c">implementation of
<code>memchr</code></a>.
Despite it being quite a bit terser than GNU’s libc implementation used in
GNU grep, it appears to be doing roughly the same work. If that’s the case,
how is <code>rg</code> faster? The answer lies not in <code>memchr</code> nor in the variant of
Boyer-Moore nor in the number characters Boyer-Moore can skip. The answer
instead lies in <em>which byte is given to <code>memchr</code>.</em> <code>rg</code> will actually try to
guess the “rarest” byte in a literal, and use <code>memchr</code> on that. (A standard
Boyer-Moore implementation will use <code>memchr</code> always on the last byte.) In
this particular case, running <code>memchr</code> on either <code>S</code> or <code>H</code> is probably
quite a bit better than running it on <code>s</code> because <code>S</code> and <code>H</code> are far less
common than <code>s</code>. That is, <code>rg</code> tries harder than GNU grep to spend more time
skipping bytes in a fast SIMD optimized loop. <code>rg</code> can get this wrong, but
it seems strictly better to at least guess and probably get it right in the
common case than to submit to an artifact of common Boyer-Moore
implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the secrets of literal search have been revealed, we can better
analyze the Russian benchmark. The answer once again lies in <em>which byte is
used</em> for quick scanning. Both <code>sift</code> and <code>pt</code> use the same AVX2 routine in
Go’s runtime, so why did they get so much slower than every other tool in the
Russian benchmark? The answer becomes more clear when we look at the actual
UTF-8 bytes of the pattern <code>Шерлок Холмс</code>:</p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>\xd0\xa8\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xba \xd0\xa5\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbc\xd1\x81</span></span></code></pre></div>


<p>There are two key observations to take away from this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every character in the pattern <code>Шерлок Холмс</code> is encoded with two UTF-8 code
units, which corresponds to two bytes.</li>
<li>Every character starts with either the byte <code>\xD0</code> or <code>\xD1</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we looked at the UTF-8 bytes of the Russian subtitles we’re searching, we’d
end up seeing exactly the same pattern. This pattern occurs because the
contents of the file are mostly Cyrllic, which are all mostly part of a couple
small ranges in Unicode. This means that the <code>\xD0</code> and <code>\xD1</code> bytes occur <em>a
lot</em>.</p>
<p>If you recall from above, Go’s regex engine will scan for occurrences of the
first byte. But if that first byte happens as frequently as it does here, the
overall search will wind up going slower because there is overhead
associated with doing that scan. This is <em>precisely</em> the trade off one is
exposed to whenever <code>memchr</code> is used.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, <code>rg</code> works around this issue by trying to guess the
rarest byte. <code>rg</code> specifically draws from a pre-computed frequency table of all
256 bytes. Bytes like <code>\xD0</code> and <code>\xD1</code> are considered to be among the most
frequent while bytes like <code>\xA8</code> and <code>\x81</code> are considered more rare.
Therefore, <code>rg</code> will prefer bytes other than <code>\xD0</code> and <code>\xD1</code> for use with
<code>memchr</code>.</p>
<p>GNU grep continues to do well on this benchmark mostly because of blind luck:
Boyer-Moore uses the last byte, which will correspond to <code>\x81</code>, which is much
rarer than <code>\xD0</code> or <code>\xD1</code>.</p>
<p>Switching gears, we should briefly discuss memory maps. In this benchmark, <code>rg</code>
beats out <code>rg (no mmap)</code> by about 25%. The only difference between the two is
that the former memory maps the file into memory while the latter incrementally
reads bytes from the file into an intermediate buffer, and searches it. In this
case, the overhead of the memory map is very small because we only need to
create one of them. This is the <em>opposite</em> result from our Linux benchmark
above, where memory maps proved to be worse than searching with an intermediate
buffer since we needed to create a new memory map for every file we searched,
which ends up incurring quite a bit of overhead. <code>rg</code> takes an empirical
approach here and enables memory map searching when it knows it only needs to
search a few files, and otherwise searches using an intermediate buffer.</p>
<p>One last note: I’ve neglected to talk about <code>(lines)</code> because there’s really
not much to say here: counting lines takes work, and if you don’t need to
report line numbers, you can avoid doing that work. <code>ucg</code> has a rather cool
SIMD algorithm to count lines and <code>rg</code> also has a packed counting algorithm
that works similarly to the <code>memchr</code> implementations we talked about.</p>
<p>If it were up to me, I’d probably remove benchmarks with line numbers
altogether, since most tools tend to reliably pay just a little bit extra for
them. However, neither <code>ag</code> nor <code>ucg</code> allow turning them off, so we need to
turn them on in other tools in order to make a fair comparison.</p>

<li><code>*</code> - Best mean time.</li>
<li><code>+</code> - Best sample time.</li>
<li>There is no <code>rg (ASCII)</code> because <code>rg</code> can’t do ASCII-only case insensitive
search.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: This is a fun benchmark, because we start to see just how awesome
<code>rg</code>’s support for Unicode is. Namely, that it not only gets it correct, but
it’s also <em>fast</em>. It’s fast enough that it beats the competition even when the
competition is using ASCII-only rules.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, GNU grep pays dearly for doing a case insensitive search
with Unicode support. The problem it faces is that it can no longer do a
straight-forward Boyer-Moore search, so it either needs to fall back to some
alternative literal search or its full regex engine. Even though GNU grep is
much faster at ASCII-only case sensitive search than its Unicode aware variant,
<code>rg</code>’s Unicode case insensitive search still handedly beats GNU grep’s
ASCII-only case insensitive search.</p>
<p>The reason why <code>rg</code> is so fast on this benchmark is the same reason why it’s
fast in the
<a href="#linux-literal-casei"><code>linux_literal_casei</code></a>
benchmark: it turns the pattern <code>Sherlock Holmes</code> into an alternation of all
possible literals according to Unicode’s simple case folding rules. It then
takes a small prefix from each alternate so that our set of literals looks like
this:</p>

<p>(Notice that we get Unicode right by including <code>ſ</code> as a case variant of <code>S</code>.)</p>
<p>It then feeds these literals to the Teddy SIMD multiple pattern algorithm. The
algorithm is unpublished, but was invented by Geoffrey Langdale as part of
<a href="https://github.com/01org/hyperscan">Intel’s Hyperscan regex library</a>.
The algorithm works roughly by using packed comparisons of 16 bytes at a time
to find candidate locations where a literal might match.
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/blob/master/src/simd_accel/teddy128.rs">I adapted the algorithm from the Hyperscan project to
Rust</a>,
and included an extensive write up in the comments if you’re interested.</p>
<p>While essentially the same analysis applies to the Russian benchmark, there are
a few interesting things to note. Namely, while the results show <code>grep (ASCII)</code>
as being very fast, it seems clear that it’s completely ignoring the <code>-i</code> flag
in this case since the pattern is not an ASCII string. Notably, its timing is
essentially identical to its timing on the previous
<a href="#subtitles-literal"><code>subtitles_literal</code></a>
benchmark. The other interesting thing to note is that <code>ag</code> reports <code>0</code>
matches. This isn’t entirely unreasonable, if it somehow knows that it can’t
satisfy the request (case insensitive search of a non-ASCII string when Unicode
support isn’t enabled). If I had to guess, I’d say PCRE is returning an error
(possibly from <code>pcre_exec</code>) and it isn’t being forwarded to the end user, but
that’s just a shot in the dark.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: <code>rg</code> does really well here, on both the English and Russian
patterns, primarily thanks to Teddy as described in the analysis for
<a href="#subtitles-literal-casei"><code>subtitles_literal_casei</code></a>. On the English pattern,
<code>rg</code> is around an <em>order of magnitude</em> faster than GNU grep.</p>
<p>The performance cost of counting lines is on full display here. For <code>rg</code> at
least, it makes returning search results take twice as long.</p>
<p>Note that the benchmark description mentions picking literals with distinct
leading bytes. This is to avoid measuring an optimization where the regex
engine detects the leading byte and runs <code>memchr</code> on it. Of course, this
optimization is important (and <code>rg</code> will of course do it), but it’s far more
interesting to benchmark what happens in a slightly trickier case.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: While <code>rg</code> gets an <em>order of magnitude</em> slower on this benchmark
compared to
<a href="#subtitles-alternate"><code>subtitles_alternate</code></a>,
it still comfortably beats out the rest of the search tools, even when other
tools don’t support Unicode. A key thing this benchmark demonstrates are the
limits of the Teddy algorithm. In fact, <code>rg</code> opts to not use Teddy in this
benchmark because it predicts it won’t perform well.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t Teddy perform well here? Well, the answer is in how we generate
literals for this pattern. Namely, <code>rg</code> will try to generate all possible
literals that satisfy Unicode simple case folding rules, and then will take a
short prefix of that set to cut the number of literals down to reasonable size.
In this particular case, we wind up with 48 literals:</p>

<p>If we passed all of those to Teddy, it would become overwhelmed. In particular,
Teddy works by finding candidates for matches very quickly. When there are
roughly the same number of candidates as there are matches, Teddy performs
exceedingly well. But, if we give it more literals, then it’s more likely to
find candidates that don’t match, and will therefore have to spend a lot more
time verifying the match, which can be costly.</p>
<p>(A more subtle aspect of the Teddy implementation is that a larger number
of literals increases the cost of every verification, even if the number of
candidates produced doesn’t increase. As I’ve mentioned before, if you want the
full scoop on Teddy, see its
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/blob/3de8c44f5357d5b582a80b7282480e38e8b7d50d/src/simd_accel/teddy128.rs">well commented
implementation</a>.
Going into more detail on Teddy would require a whole blog post on its own!)</p>
<p>When <code>rg</code> sees that there are a large number of literals, it could do one of
two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to cut down the set even more. For example, in this case, we could strip
the last character from each prefix off and end up with a much smaller set.
Unfortunately, even though we have fewer literals, we wind up with a still
not-so-small set of two-character literals, which will also tend to produce
a lot more false positive candidates just because of their length.</li>
<li>Move to a different multiple pattern algorithm, such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm">Aho-Corasick</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have tried to implement (1) in the past, but I’ve always wound up in a game
of whack-a-mole. I might make one common case faster, but another common case a
lot slower. In those types of cases, it’s usually better to try and achieve
good average case performance. Luckily for us, Aho-Corasick does <em>exactly</em>
that.</p>
<p>We do still have a few tricks up our sleeve though. For example, many
Aho-Corasick implementations are built as-if they were
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">tries</a>
with back-pointers for their failure transitions.
We can actually do better than that. We can compile all of its failure
transitions into a DFA with a transition table contiguous in memory. This means
that every byte of input corresponds to a single lookup in the transition table
to find the next state. We never have to waste time chasing pointers or walking
more than one failure transition for any byte in the search text.</p>
<p>Of course, this transition table based approach is memory intensive, since you
need space for <code>number_of_literals * number_of_states</code>, where
<code>number_of_states</code> is roughly capped at the total number of bytes in all of the
literals. While 48 literals of length 3 is too much for Teddy to handle, it’s
barely a blip when it comes to Aho-Corasick, even with its memory expensive
transition table based approach. (N.B. In the literature, this particular
implementation of Aho-Corasick is often called “Advanced” Aho-Corasick.)</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: In order to compete on this benchmark, a search tool will need to
implement a so-called “inner literal” optimization. You can probably guess what
that means: it is an optimization that looks for literal strings that appear
<em>anywhere</em> in the pattern, and if a literal is found that must appear in every
match, then a search tool can quickly scan for that literal instead of applying
the full regex to the search text.</p>
<p>The key thing that permits this optimization to work is the fact that most
search tools report results <em>per line</em>. For example, in this case, if a line
contains the literal <code>Holmes</code>, then the search tool can find the beginning and
ending of that line and run the full pattern on <em>just that line</em>. If the
literal is relatively rare, this keeps us out of the regex engine for most of
the search. And of course, if the literal doesn’t appear at all in the corpus,
then we will have never touched the regex engine at all.</p>
<p>To achieve the full optimization, you probably need to parse your pattern
into its abstract syntax (abbreviated “AST” for abstract syntax tree) to
extract the literal. It is worth pointing out however that one can probably get
a lot of mileage with simpler heuristics, but a real pattern parser is the only
way to do this optimization robustly. The problem here is that for most regex
engines, parsing the pattern is an unexposed implementation detail, so it can
be hard for search tools to extract literals in a robust way without writing
their own parser, and a modern regex parser is no easy task! Thankfully, Rust’s
regex library exposes an additional library,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/regex/regex_syntax/index.html"><code>regex-syntax</code></a>,
which provides a full parser. <code>rg</code> implements this optimization relatively
easily with the help of <code>regex-syntax</code>, while GNU grep implements this
optimization because the search tool and the underlying regex engine are
coupled together.</p>
<p>Why does the search tool need to perform this optimization? Why can’t the
underlying regex engine do it? I personally have thought long and hard about
this particular problem and haven’t been able to come up with an elegant
solution. The core problem is that once you find an occurrence of the literal,
you <em>don’t know where to start searching the full regex</em>. In a general purpose
regex engine, a pattern could match an arbitrarily long string. For example,
<code>\w+\s+Holmes\s+\w+</code> mightly only match at the very end of a gigabyte sized
document. There are ways to work around this. For example, you could split the
regex into three pieces: <code>\w+\s+</code>, <code>Holmes</code> and <code>\s+\w+</code>. On every occurrence
of the <code>Holmes</code> literal, you could search for the beginning of the match by
executing <code>\w+\s+</code> in reverse starting just before the literal, and executing
<code>\s+\w+</code> forwards starting just after the literal. The key problem with this
approach is that it exposes you to quadratic behavior in the worst case (since
<code>\w+\s+</code> or <code>\s+\w+</code> could cause you to re-scan text you’ve already seen).
While I believe there is a general purpose way to solve this and still
guarantee linear time searching, a good solution hasn’t revealed itself yet.</p>
<p>Based on the data in this benchmark, only <code>rg</code> and GNU grep perform this
optimization. Neither <code>ag</code> nor <code>ucg</code> attempt to extract any inner literals from
the pattern, and it looks like PCRE doesn’t try to do anything too clever.
(Of course, Rust’s regex library doesn’t either, this optimization is done in
<code>rg</code> proper.)</p>
<p>As for the Russian pattern, we see that only tools with proper Unicode support
can execute the query successfully. The reason is because <code>\w</code> is ASCII only in
<code>ucg</code> and <code>ag</code>, so it can’t match the vast majority of word characters (which
are Cyrllic) in our sample. Otherwise, both <code>rg</code> and GNU grep remain fast,
primarily because of the inner literal optimization.</p>
<h3 id="subtitles_no_literal"><code>subtitles_no_literal</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This benchmark purposefully has no literals in it, which makes
it a bit idiosyncratic, since most searches done by end users probably have at
least some literal in them. However, it is a useful benchmark to gauge the
general performance of the underlying regex engine.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>*</code> - Best mean time.</li>
<li><code>+</code> - Best sample time.</li>
<li><code>ag</code> gets more matches on the English pattern since it does multiline search.
Namely, the <code>\s</code> can match a <code>\n</code>.</li>
<li><code>grep</code> with Unicode support was dropped from this benchmark because it takes
over 90 seconds on the English pattern and over 4 <strong>minutes</strong> on the Russian
pattern. In both cases, GNU grep and <code>rg</code> report the same results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: Once again, no other search tool performs as well as <code>rg</code>. For
the English pattern, both <code>rg</code> and <code>rg (ASCII)</code> have very similar performance,
despite <code>rg</code> supporting Unicode.</p>
<p>What specifically makes <code>rg</code> faster than GNU grep in this case? Both search
tools ultimately use a DFA to execute this pattern, so their performance should
be roughly the same. I don’t actually have a particularly good answer for this.
Both GNU grep and Rust’s regex library unroll the DFA’s inner loop, and both
implementations compute states on the fly. I can make a guess though.</p>
<p>Rust’s regex library avoids a single pointer dereference when following a
transition. How it achieves this is complicated, but it’s done by representing
states as indices into the transition table rather than simple incremental ids.
This permits the generated code to use simple addition to address the location
of the next transition, which can be done with addressing modes in a single
instruction. (Specifically, this optimization means we don’t need to do any
multiplication to find the state transition.) A single pointer dereference
might not seem like much, but when it’s done for every state transition over a
large corpus such as this, it can have an impact.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Russian pattern, such details are far less important
because GNU grep takes <em>minutes</em> to run. This suggests that it isn’t building
UTF-8 decoding into its DFA, and is instead doing something like decoding a
character at a time, which can have a lot of overhead associated with it. I
admit that I don’t quite grok this aspect of GNU grep though, so I could have
its cost model wrong. Now, in all fairness, GNU grep’s locale and encoding
support far exceeds what <code>rg</code> supports. However, in today’s world, UTF-8 is
quite prevalent, so supporting that alone is often enough. More to the point,
given how common UTF-8 is, it’s important to remain fast while supporting
Unicode, which GNU grep isn’t able to do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the other tools don’t support Unicode, so they can’t be
meaningfully benchmarked on the Russian pattern.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-benchmarks">Bonus benchmarks</h2>
<p>In this section, we’ll take a look at a few crazier benchmarks that aren’t
actually part of the suite I’ve published. Indeed, the performance differences
between tools are often so large that a fastidious analysis isn’t really
necessary. More to the point, these usage patterns aren’t necessarily
representative of common usage (not that these usages aren’t important, they’re
just niche), so the performance differences are less important. Nevertheless,
it is fun to see how well <code>rg</code> and the other tools hold up under these
requests.</p>
<h3 id="everything"><code>everything</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: In this benchmark, we compare how long it takes for each tool
to report every line as a match. This benchmark was run in the root of the
Linux repository.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern</strong>: <code>.*</code></p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>rg                 1.081 (lines: 22065361)
</span></span><span><span>ag                 1.660 (lines: 55939)
</span></span><span><span>git grep           3.448 (lines: 22066395)
</span></span><span><span>sift             110.018 (lines: 22190112)

</span></span><span><span>rg (whitelist)     0.987 (lines: 20936584)
</span></span><span><span>ucg (whitelist)    5.558 (lines: 23163359)</span></span></code></pre></div>


<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: This benchmark is somewhat silly since it’s something you
probably never want a search tool to do. Nevertheless, it is useful to know
that <code>rg</code> scales quite well to a huge number of matches.</p>
<p>One of the key tricks that a good regex engine will do in this case is stop
searching text as soon as it knows it has a match if all the caller cares about
is “is there a match or not?” In this case, we will find a match at the
beginning of every line, immediately quit, find the line boundaries and then
repeat the process. There is no particular special cased optimization for <code>.*</code>
in either <code>rg</code> or Rust’s regex library (although there could be).</p>
<p>Interestingly, neither <code>ag</code> nor <code>pt</code> actually report every line. They appear to
have some kind of match limit. Which isn’t altogether unreasonable. This is a
search tool after all, and some might consider that returning every result
isn’t useful.</p>
<h3 id="nothing"><code>nothing</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This is just like the <a href="#everything"><code>everything</code></a> benchmark,
except it inverts the results. The correct result is for a search tool to
report no lines as matching. This benchmark also searches the Linux kernel
source code, from the root of repository.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern</strong>: <code>.*</code> (with the <code>-v</code> or <code>--invert-match</code> flag set)</p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>rg                0.302 (lines: 0)
</span></span><span><span>ag                takes minutes
</span></span><span><span>git grep          0.905 (lines: 0)
</span></span><span><span>sift             12.804 (lines: 0)
</span></span><span><span>pt                -----
</span></span><span><span>rg (whitelist)    0.251 (lines: 0)
</span></span><span><span>ucg (whitelist)   -----</span></span></code></pre></div>


<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: While this benchmark is even more ridiculous than the previous
one (“give me nothing of everything”), it does expose a few warts and omissions
in other tools. Namely, <code>ag</code> seems to slow way down when reporting inverted
matches. Neither <code>pt</code> nor <code>ucg</code> support inverted searching at all. <code>sift</code>
redeems itself from the previous benchmark (perhaps it has a lot of overhead
associated with printing matches that it doesn’t hit here). Neither <code>rg</code> nor
<code>git grep</code> have any problems satisfying the request.</p>
<h3 id="context"><code>context</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This benchmarks how well a search tool can show the context
around each match. Specifically, in this case, we ask for the two lines
preceding and succeeding every match. We run this benchmark on the English
subtitle corpus. Note that all tools are asked to count lines.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern</strong>: <code>Sherlock Holmes</code> (with <code>--context 2</code>)</p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>rg        0.612 (lines: 3533)
</span></span><span><span>ag        3.530 (lines: 3533)
</span></span><span><span>grep      1.075 (lines: 3533)
</span></span><span><span>sift      0.717 (lines: 3533)
</span></span><span><span>pt       17.331 (lines: 2981)
</span></span><span><span>ucg       -----</span></span></code></pre></div>


<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: <code>rg</code> continues to do well here, but beats <code>sift</code> by only a hair.
In general, computing the context shouldn’t be that expensive since it is done
rarely (only for each match). Nevertheless, both <code>ag</code> and <code>pt</code> seem to take a
pretty big hit for it. <code>pt</code> also seems to have a bug. (Which is understandable,
getting contexts right is tricky.) Finally, <code>ucg</code> doesn’t support this feature,
so we can’t benchmark it.</p>
<h3 id="huge"><code>huge</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This benchmark runs a simple literal search on a file that is
<code>9.3GB</code>. In fact, this is the original English subtitle corpus in its entirety.
(In the benchmark suite, we take a 1GB sample.)</p>
<p><strong>Pattern</strong>: <code>Sherlock Holmes</code></p>



<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>rg                1.786 (lines: 5107)
</span></span><span><span>grep              5.119 (lines: 5107)
</span></span><span><span>sift              3.047 (lines: 5107)
</span></span><span><span>pt               14.966 (lines: 5107)
</span></span><span><span>rg (lines)        4.467 (lines: 5107)
</span></span><span><span>ag (lines)       19.132 (lines: 5107)
</span></span><span><span>grep (lines)      9.213 (lines: 5107)
</span></span><span><span>sift (lines)      6.303 (lines: 5107)
</span></span><span><span>pt (lines)       15.485 (lines: 5107)
</span></span><span><span>ucg (lines)       4.843 (lines: 1543)</span></span></code></pre></div>


<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: At first glance, it appears <code>ucg</code> competes with <code>rg</code> when
counting lines (being only slightly slower), but in fact, <code>ucg</code> reports the
wrong number of results! My suspicion is that <code>ucg</code> gets into trouble when
trying to search files over 2GB.</p>
<p>The other intesting bit here is how slow <code>pt</code> is, even when not counting lines,
despite the fact that <code>sift</code> is fast. They both use Go’s regexp engine and
should be able to be fast in the case of a simple literal. It’s not clear what
<code>pt</code>’s slow down here is. One hypothesis is that even though I’m asking it to
not count lines, it’s still counting them but simply not showing them.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>I started this blog post by claiming that I could support the following claims
with evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>For both searching single files <em>and</em> huge directories of files, no other
tool obviously stands above <code>ripgrep</code> in either performance or correctness.</li>
<li><code>ripgrep</code> is the only tool with proper Unicode support that doesn’t make
you pay dearly for it.</li>
<li>Tools that search many files at once are generally <em>slower</em> if they use
memory maps, not faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>I attempted to substantiate the first claim by picking a popular repository
(Linux kernel) and a variety of patterns that an end user might search for.
While <code>rg</code> doesn’t quite come out on top on every benchmark, no other tool can
claim superiority. In particular, <code>git grep</code> edges out <code>rg</code> on occasion by a
few milliseconds, but <code>rg</code> in turn will beat <code>git grep</code> handedly
(sometimes by an order of magnitude, as in the case of
<a href="#linux-unicode-word"><code>linux_unicode_word</code></a>) as the patterns grow more complex,
especially when the search tool is asked to support Unicode. <code>rg</code> manages to
compete with <code>git grep</code> and beat other tools like The Silver Searcher by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing fast directory traversal with a minimal number of stat calls.</li>
<li>Applying <code>.gitignore</code> filters with a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/regex/regex/struct.RegexSet.html"><code>RegexSet</code></a>,
which enables matching multiple globs against a single path all at once.</li>
<li>Distributing work quickly to multiple threads with a Chase-Lev work stealing
queue.</li>
<li>Explicitly <em>not</em> using memory maps.</li>
<li>Using an overall very fast regex engine.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also attempted to substantiate the first claim by showing benchmarks of <code>rg</code>
against other tools on a single file. In this benchmark, <code>rg</code> comes out on top
in every single one, often by a large margin. Some of those results are a
result of the following optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempting to pick a “rare” byte to use <code>memchr</code> with for fast skipping.</li>
<li>Using a special SIMD algorithm called Teddy for fast multiple pattern search.</li>
<li>When Teddy isn’t usable, fallback to an “advanced” form of Aho-Corasick that
never moves through more than one transition on each byte of input.</li>
<li>Building UTF-8 decoding into a finite state machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the second claim, I provided benchmarks that attempt to use Unicode
features such as conforming to Unicode’s simple case folding rules and Unicode
aware character classes such as <code>\w</code>. The only tools capable of handling
Unicode are <code>rg</code>, GNU grep and <code>git grep</code>. The latter two tend to get much
slower when supporting the full gamut of Unicode while <code>rg</code> mostly maintains
its performance.</p>
<p>For the third claim, I showed multiple benchmarks of <code>rg</code> controlling for
memory maps. Namely, we measured how fast <code>rg</code> was both with and without memory
maps, and showed that memory maps perform worse when searching many small files
in parallel, but perform better on searching single large files. (At least, on
<code>Linux x86_64</code>.) We also learned that memory maps probably pay an additional
penalty inside a VM.</p>
<p>My hope is that this article not only convinced you that <code>rg</code> is quite fast,
but more importantly, that you found my analysis of each benchmark educational.
String searching is an old problem in computer science, but there is still
plenty of work left to do to advance the state of the art.</p>
