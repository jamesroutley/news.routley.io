    <h1>Bitcoin&#39;s Security Budget Issue: Problems, Solutions and Myths Debunked</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <section id="introduction">  <div> <h2>Introduction</h2> <h3>On Bitcoin&#39;s Security <a href="#introduction" aria-label="Copy link to this section" x-on:click="copyAnchorHref($el); mnumbers(&#39;User_Interaction&#39;, &#39;Click&#39;, &#39;Anchor_Section_Introduction&#39;)" role="button">#</a></h3> <p>
Bitcoin&#39;s breakthrough was solving the double-spending problem using a Proof⁠-⁠of⁠-⁠Work (PoW) mechanism (<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf?utm_source=budget.day&amp;utm_content=textlink" target="_blank" rel="external" x-on:click="mnumbers(&#39;User_Interaction&#39;, &#39;Click&#39;, &#39;Anchor_Introduction_see_whitepaper&#39;)">see whitepaper</a>). Bitcoin remains secure as long as honest miners control the majority of the network&#39;s computing power.
</p> </div> <div> <div> <ol> <li> <p>The reverse situation is known as a
<strong>51% attack</strong>, which can manifest in different ways:</p> <div> <h4>[1] Double⁠-⁠spending by rewriting recent history.</h4> <p>A double-spending attack in Bitcoin happens when someone tries to spend the same coins twice. If they control more than half the network’s mining power, they can create a secret version of the blockchain that removes a payment they already made. When they reveal this version, it replaces the original, canceling the first transaction and letting them keep the coins.</p> <p><img src="https://budget.day/_astro/dragon.CUvvC7pc.webp" alt="Purple dragon shows you what a 51% attack is.

This means they can selectively prevent transactions from or to specific addresses or entities from being confirmed, effectively censoring them from the network.</p> <p><img src="https://budget.day/_astro/censorship.B6Myp7Yd.webp" alt="Person in a perple suit (probably a miner) stands with sheets of text floating around him. Some of sheets are crossed with red X" width="550" height="440" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low" decoding="async"/> </p></div> </li> <li> <div> <h4>[3] Halting the network by producing empty blocks only.</h4> <p>The attacker can choose to create blocks without any transactions — just the coinbase reward — thus preventing regular transactions from being processed. This can stall the entire Bitcoin network, degrade usability, and cause widespread disruption.</p> <p><img src="https://budget.day/_astro/abandoned-block.CbGVfE2N.webp" alt="Abandoned cube of purple transparent glass and purple frame: there are green vines around it" width="550" height="440" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low" decoding="async"/> </p></div> </li> </ol> </div> </div>  </section> <section id="orpahned-attack">  <p>
Honest miners not participating in such an attack have their blocks orphaned, meaning the network does not recognize them as part of the valid chain. Their work becomes useless and they won&#39;t get any rewards.
</p>  </section> <section id="security-budget-1">  <div> <h2>Security in Bitcoin isn&#39;t free</h2> <p>The term &#34;<strong>security budget</strong>&#34; in Bitcoin refers to the total amount of money paid to miners to secure the network.
</p> </div> <div> <div> <ul> <li> <p>Approximately every 10 minutes, miners are paid to keep the network safe — this is the security budget. It consists of:</p> <ol> <li> <p>[1] Block subsidy (newly minted BTC)</p> <img src="https://budget.day/_astro/hero-holding-coin.cGPmpM6H.webp" alt="Purple hero holding golden coin" width="550" height="440" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low" decoding="async"/> </li> <li> <p>[2] Transaction fees</p> <img src="https://budget.day/_astro/purple-btc.BLtilXRx.webp" alt="Purple Bitcoin coin" width="550" height="440" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low" decoding="async"/> </li> </ol> <p>Miners earn rewards through block subsidies and transaction fees, but their actual profit is what remains
<strong>after covering the costs of hardware and electricity</strong>. Since mining is highly competitive and demands specialized equipment and significant energy consumption, these expenses can add up a lot.
</p> </li> <li> <div> <p>For an attacker to compromise Bitcoin, they must outpower all honest miners.
</p> <p><img src="https://budget.day/_astro/window-51.DvwJexj5.webp" alt="Purple window with 51%" width="550" height="440" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low" decoding="async"/> </p></div> </li> </ul> </div> </div>  </section> <section id="security-budget-2">  <div> <h2>Security budget =</h2> <p>So, the larger the budget, the harder it is to attack.</p> </div> <div> <div> <p>Miners are profit-driven — they won’t spend more on equipment and electricity than they expect to earn. So, the total miner revenue sets an upper limit on how much honest miners are willing to spend and an upper bound on how expensive it would be to attack the network. The higher the security budget, the more costly it is to perform a 51% attack — and the
<strong>more secure Bitcoin is</strong>.</p> <p><img src="https://budget.day/_astro/miner-on-watch.B9aaHHv6.webp" alt="Miner in purple suit with pickaxe on the watch near mining rig" width="550" height="440" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low" decoding="async"/></p><p>Makes sense, right?

				This could reduce total hashpower, potentially lowering the cost of attacking the network and increasing the risk of chain reorganizations.
				While Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment helps stabilize the system, the long-term reliance on transaction fees remains an open challenge.</p> </div> </div>   </section> <section id="key-problems-subsidy-decrease">  <div> <div> <h2>Experts on Subsidy Decrease</h2> <h3>Experts are sounding the alarm: <a href="#key-problems-subsidy-decrease" aria-label="Copy link to this section" x-on:click="copyAnchorHref($el); mnumbers(&#39;User_Interaction&#39;, &#39;Click&#39;, &#39;Anchor_Key_Problems_Subsidy_Decrease&#39;)" role="button">#</a></h3> <blockquote> <cite>James O&#39;Beirne (<a href="https://x.com/jamesob?utm_source=budget.day&amp;utm_content=citelink" rel="external norefferer" target="_blank" x-on:click="mnumbers(&#39;User_Interaction&#39;, &#39;Click&#39;, &#39;Anchor_Experts_X_Handle_James&#39;)">@jamesob</a>) — Bitcoin Core developer <a href="https://x.com/SupplyShockBW/status/1915417306001506378?utm_source=budget.day&amp;utm_content=citelink" rel="external norefferer" target="_blank" x-on:click="mnumbers(&#39;User_Interaction&#39;, &#39;Click&#39;, &#39;Anchor_Experts_BTCTN&#39;)">said on @BTCTN</a>:</cite> <span>&#34;We might have only two halvings left before this becomes a serious issue.&#34;</span> <hr/> </blockquote> <blockquote> <cite> <span>Nikita Zhavoronkov (<a href="https://x.com/nikzh/status/1908901844161560838?utm_source=budget.day&amp;utm_content=citelink" rel="external norefferer" target="_blank" x-on:click="mnumbers(&#39;User_Interaction&#39;, &#39;Click&#39;, &#39;Anchor_Experts_X_Handle_Nikita&#39;)">@nikzh</a>) — Founder of Blockchair:</span> <img src="https://budget.day/_astro/knight.Ck5HO-md.webp" alt="Knight in a shiny armor holding a sword and a shield" width="550" height="440" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/> </cite> <span>&#34;It&#39;s now clear in practice that users won&#39;t pay large fees.
