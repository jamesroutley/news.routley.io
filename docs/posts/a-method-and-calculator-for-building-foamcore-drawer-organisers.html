    <h1>A method and calculator for building foamcore drawer organisers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a man in possession of a good set of drawers, must be in want of a good organization system.</p><figure><img srcset="/posts/foamcore-would-be-a-sick-name-for-a-music-genre/drawer_hu_f55c4a92057fec54.jpg,

Absolute mayhem; cables getting tangled with old keyrings, snacks sitting uncomfortably close to strong glue.</p><p>I hunted around for off-the-shelf drawer organisers, but didn’t really find anything that fit my needs. And then I stumbled across Foamcore.</p><h2 id="-foamcore-">🤘 #FOAMCORE 🤘</h2><p>It sounds like a <em>siiiiick</em> music genre, but it unfortunately isn’t. It’s two sheets of paper with a layer of hard, dense foam between them. At my local crafts supplies store, it <a href="https://www.modulor.de/kapa-graph-schwarz-5-0-x-500-x-700-st.html">comes in 500 x 700mm sheets</a>, in black and white. And it’s perfect for making boxes and organizers.</p><p>In addition to the board, you’ll need:</p><ul><li>A <strong>sharp knife</strong>: a box cutter, pen knife, etc.</li><li>A <strong>hard edge</strong>: a ruler will work, but it’ll be much easier with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_square">carpenter’s square</a> because then you can brace against a known straight edge.</li><li>A <strong>cutting mat</strong> so that you don’t accidentally carve into your work surface.</li><li><strong>Craft glue</strong> of some kind.</li><li><strong>Small pins</strong>, for holding panels in place while the glue sets.</li></ul><p>Once you’ve done that, the steps are:</p><ul><li><p>Figure out all the shapes you’ll need (more on this soon)</p></li><li><p>Cut them out</p></li><li><p>Glue / pin them together. Start with the base and the two sides that have an edge that matches the base. This makes a little more sense if you look at the exploded view:</p><figure><img srcset="/posts/foamcore-would-be-a-sick-name-for-a-music-genre/exploded_hu_8207ba795b185842.jpg,

They’ll go better if you attach the top / bottom pieces to the base first."/><figcaption><p>See how the left / right pieces are longer than their corresponding edges on the base?</p></figcaption></figure></li><li><p>That’s it! In theory you can (should?) remove the pins after the glue’s set, but my pins came in a “lifetime supply”-sized box and are very small, so I just leave them in. They look kinda cool.</p></li></ul><figure><img srcset="/posts/foamcore-would-be-a-sick-name-for-a-music-genre/box_hu_269e0439bf136fe5.jpg,

Go use it:</p><p>I’ve been building open boxes with a base, which is super helpful because you can lift the boxes clean out of the drawer with all of their contents.</p><p>To figure out the panel sizes: assume a box of width W, depth D, and height H. If your foamcore board has a thickness of 5mm, you need</p><ul><li>two sides that are W x H</li><li>Two sides that are (D - 10mm) x H</li><li>One base, (W - 10mm) x (D - 10mm).</li></ul><p>The tricky (fiddly, error-prone) part of the calculations is that the thickness affects the geometry.</p><p>The <em>other</em> tricky bit is figuring out how many sheets of foamcore board you’ll need – that’s why I built the calculator. If, however, you’ve got a surplus of foamcore and are trying to avoid using a computer while you’re crafting, a pretty good heuristic is:</p><ul><li>Cut a bunch of strips that are as thick as your box height. If you’re making 80mm high boxes, cut strips 80mm thick.</li><li>Then you can cut all the wall panels directly out of those strips; the only thing you need to think about separately is the bases.</li></ul><p><strong>Also, warning</strong>: if you’re planning on completely filling a space (e.g. a drawer or a board game box), measure the inside carefully and then <em>check the fit with an offcut</em>. It’s super annoying when you’ve spent twenty minutes building a box and then discover that it’s a millimeter too big. 😐</p><h2 id="box-variations">Box variations</h2><p>You don’t have to just make five-sided, open boxes!</p><h3 id="risers">Risers</h3><p>You can add a riser for objects that you want to keep handy but would otherwise sit too low in the drawer to make them grabbable. This is just a 5-sided box, upside-down:</p><figure><img srcset="/posts/foamcore-would-be-a-sick-name-for-a-music-genre/riser_hu_bf016545b5a60ae9.jpg,
