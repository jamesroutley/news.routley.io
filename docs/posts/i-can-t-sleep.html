To find a historical comparison for so many large bombs in such a small area, he said, we may “have to go back to Vietnam, or the Second World War.”</blockquote><blockquote>In fighting during this century, by contrast, U.S. military officials often believed that the most common American aerial bomb — a 500-pound weapon — was far too large for most targets when battling the Islamic State in urban areas like Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria.</blockquote><p>[41] An MK-84 costs $16,000, so your taxes can kill more civilians than you think.</p><p>[42] I’ll note that the same conservatives screaming about freedom of speech for the last decade were the first to ask for freedom of speech to be shut down at universities.</p><p>[43] “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” is deliberately misconstrued to imply the genocide of the the Israel people.
