    <h1>Migrating Dillo from GitHub</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<i>Written on 2025-11-30 by Rodrigo Arias Mallo</i>
<p>I would like to migrate the Dillo project away from
<a href="https://github.com/dillo-browser/">GitHub</a>
into a new home which is more friendly to be used with Dillo and solves some of
its problems. This page summarizes the current situation with GitHub and why I
decided to move away from it into a self-hosted server with multiple mirrors in
other forges.
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the details, I would like to briefly mention what
happened with the old site. The original Dillo website was at dillo.org,
which also had the source code of Dillo in a mercurial repository at
hg.dillo.org. But it also included the mail server used to reach the developers,
a bug tracker and archives for the mailing list. However, in 2022
<a href="https://dillo-browser.org/dillo.org.html">the domain was lost</a> and someone else decided to
buy it to put a similar site but plaged with AI generated ads. The original
developers are no longer active, but luckily I had a copy of the mercurial
repository and with some help I was able to recover a lot of material from the
original server (some parts are still missing to this day).
</p><p>
I want to avoid this situation as much as possible, so we cannot rely on a
single site that can go down and the whole project become lost. Initially, I
uploaded the Dillo source and website to git repositories on GitHub, but I no
longer think this is a good idea.
</p><h2>The situation with GitHub</h2>
<p>GitHub has been useful to store all repositories of the Dillo project, as
well as to run the CI workflows for platforms in which I don&#39;t have a machine
available (like Windows, Mac OS or some BSDs).

</p><p>However, it has several problems that make it less suitable to develop Dillo
anymore. The most annoying problem is that the frontend barely works without
JavaScript, so we cannot open issues, pull requests, source code or CI logs in
Dillo itself, despite them being mostly plain HTML, which I don&#39;t think is
acceptable. In the past, it used to gracefully degrade without enforcing
JavaScript, but now it doesn&#39;t. Additionally, the page is very resource hungry,
which I don&#39;t think is needed to render mostly static text.

</p><p>Another big problem is that it is a single point of failure. I don&#39;t mean
that GitHub is stored in a single machine, but it is controlled by a single
entity which can unilateraly ban our repository or account and we would lose the
ability to notify in that URL what happened. This can cause data loss if we
don&#39;t have a local copy of all the data.

</p><p>On the usability side, the platform has become more and more slow over
time, which is affecting the development process. It also requires you to have
a fast Internet connection at all times, which is not the case for me
sometimes. Additionally, GitHub seems to encourage a &#34;push model&#34; in which you
are notified when a new event occurs in your project(s), but I don&#39;t want to
work with that model. Instead, I prefer it to work as a &#34;pull model&#34;, so I only
get updates when I specifically look for them. This model would also allow me to
easily work offline. Unfortunately, I see that the same push model has been
copied to alternative forges.

</p><p>On the social side, I feel that it doesn&#39;t have the right tools to moderate
users, specially for projects where the ratio of non-technical users to
developers is high. This is specially problematic when active issues with
developer notes begin to be filled with comments from users that have never
contributed to the project and usually do more harm than good. This situation
ends up causing burnout in developers.

</p><p>Lastly, GitHub seem to follow the current trend of over-focusing on LLMs and
generative AI, which are destroying the open web (or what remains of it) among
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence#Concerns">other
problems</a>. It has a direct impact on us because sites protect themseves with
a JavaScript wall (or worse, browser fingerprinting) to prevent aggresive LLM
crawler bots from overloading the site, but they also leave Dillo users out. So
I would prefer not to encourage this trend. Despite my intentions, moving Dillo
away won&#39;t change much their capability to train their model with our code, but
at least I won&#39;t be actively helping.

</p><h2>Self-hosting Dillo</h2>
<p>After researching the available options, it seems that none of the current
forges would allow us to have a redundant system that can prevent the forge from
becoming a single point of failure and solve the rest of the problems with
GitHub. Therefore, I decided to self-host Dillo myself, move all important data
to git repositories and keep them synchronized in multiple git mirrors.

</p><p>I decided to buy the dillo-browser.org domain name and setup a very small
VPS. Initially, I was very skeptical that it would be able to survive on
today&#39;s web, but it seems to be doing an acceptable job at handling it (mostly
AI bot traffic masquerading as users). The Dillo website is available here:
</p><p>
<a href="https://dillo-browser.org/">https://dillo-browser.org/</a>

</p><p>I researched which git frontends may suit our needs, and I discovered that
most options are very complicated to self-host and require a lot of server
resources and JavaScript on the frontend. I ended up testing cgit, which is
written in C and it seems to be very lightweight both on RAM and CPU usage.
Furthermore, the web frontend doesn&#39;t require JS, so I can use it from Dillo (I
modified cgit CSS slightly to work well on Dillo). It is available on this URL:
</p><p>
<a href="https://git.dillo-browser.org/">https://git.dillo-browser.org/</a>

</p><p>Regarding the bug tracker, I also took a look at the available options. They
are all too complicated for what I would like to have and they seem to
centralize the data into a database that can get lost. This is precisely the
case that happened with the old dillo bug tracker and we are still unable to
recover the original bug entries.

</p><p>To avoid this problem, I created my own bug tracker software,
<a href="https://git.dillo-browser.org/buggy/">buggy</a>, which
is a very simple C tool that parses plain Markdown files and creates a
single HTML page for each bug. All bugs are stored in a
<a href="https://git.dillo-browser.org/bugtracker/">git repository</a>
and a git hook regenerates the bug pages and the index on each new commit. As it
is simply plain text, I can edit the bugs locally and only push them to the
remote when I have Internet back, so it works nice offline. Also, as the output
is just an static HTML site, I don&#39;t need to worry about having any
vulnerabilities in my code, as it will only run at build time. You can see it
live here, with the exported issues from GitHub:
</p><p>
<a href="https://bug.dillo-browser.org/">https://bug.dillo-browser.org/</a>

</p><p>The mailing list archives are stored by three independent external services,
but I might include a copy with our own archives in the future.

</p><h2>Setting up mirrors</h2>
<p>As all the important data is now stored in git repositories, we can mirror
them in any forge, without having to rely on their custom storage format for the
issues or other data. If a forge goes down (or goes rogue) we can simply switch
to another site with low switching cost. To this end, I have created git mirrors
in Codeberg and Sourcehut that are synced with our git server:
</p><ul>
  <li><strong>Codeberg</strong>:
    <a href="https://codeberg.org/dillo/">https://codeberg.org/dillo/</a>
  </li><li><strong>Sourcehut</strong>:
    <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~dillo/">https://git.sr.ht/~dillo/</a>
</li></ul>
<p>
However, we still have a single point of failure: the DNS entry of the
dillo-browser.org domain. If we lose the DNS entry (like with dillo.org) it
would cause a problem as all services will be unreachable. We could recover from
such situation by relying on alternative ways to reach users, by the mailing
list, fediverse or IRC, as well as updating the mirrors to reflect the current
situation. It is not ideal, but I don&#39;t think it would cause a catastrophic data
loss (like it happened before) as all the data is now stored in git and
replicated across independent locations.

</p><h2>OpenPGP signature</h2>
<p>In order for this page to have some authority, the HTML file is signed with
my <a href="https://dillo-browser.org/news/migration-from-github/rodarima.asc">GPG key</a>
(32E65EC501A1B6FDF8190D293EE6BA977EB2A253), which is the
same that I use to sign the <a href="https://dillo-browser.org/release">last releases</a> of Dillo and is
also listed in <a href="https://github.com/rodarima.gpg">my GitHub user</a>. The
signature <a href="https://dillo-browser.org/news/migration-from-github/index.html.asc">is available here</a> and is linked to the
page with the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag using the <code>rel=signature</code>
relation. You can find more information and how to verify the signature in the
<a href="https://dillo-browser.org/rfc/006-signatures-html/">Dillo RFC-006</a>.

</p><p>Using OpenPGP signatures is robust against losing the DNS entry, as the
authority is not given by the TLS certificate chain but by the trust in the
OpenPGP signature, so we could move the site elsewhere and still claim that is
owned by us. Additionally, as we can store the signatures inside all git
mirrors, they are also resilient against data loss.

</p><h2>Closing remarks</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that the migration process requires several moving parts and it
will take a while for it to stabilize (switching costs). <strong>The GitHub
  repositories won&#39;t be removed at any point in time and they will continue to
  be updated until we finish the migration</strong>. When the migration process
is completed, I will mark the Dillo repositories as archived and properly
comunicate it in our site. It is important that we don&#39;t remove any commit or
tarball release to avoid breaking downstream builds that still rely on the
GitHub URL.

</p><p>Lastly, I&#39;m glad that we can have our own fully independent and
self-hosted site with relatively low expenses and very little energy cost (which
is good for the environment, but probably not even noticeable at large scale).
With the current DNS and server costs and our current donations I consider that
it is likely that we can continue covering the expenses for at least the next 3
years in the worst case scenario. If you are interested in keeping us afloat,
