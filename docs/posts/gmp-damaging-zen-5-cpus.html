    <h1>GMP damaging Zen 5 CPUs?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<h3>Background</h3>

<p> We have fried two Ryzen 9950X CPUs in a few months by running GMP tests.
This is not expected, of course.  In this page, we provide as much information
as possible to help analysing the problem.
</p>
<p>
What causes these CPUs to die while running GMP is unknown to us.  While
similar, it is not the widely reported Asrock motherboard problem, as the
motherboards we use are of a different make (see below).  It might be that the
Zen 5 CPUs pull more power than specified when running GMP, or it might be that
our cooling solutions are inadequate.
</p>
<p>
The 1st failure happened in late winter 2025 (February IIRC).  The system was
located in a dedicated room in a flat in Stockholm, Sweden.  The ambient
temperature in the room was low, less than 20°C.
</p>
<p>
The 2nd failure happened 2025-08-24 in a dedicated computer room, with ambient
temperature just over 20°C.
</p>
<p>

After both failures, we took out the CPUs and found a discoloured area of
perhaps 25mm² on the pin side.  Here are two picture from different angles of the 2nd CPU:

<p>
We use a Noctua cooling solution for both systems. For the 1st system, we
mounted the heat sink centred.  For the 2nd system, we followed Noctua&#39;s advice
of mounting things offset towards what they claim to be the hotter side of the
CPU.  Below is a picture of the 2nd system without the heat sink which shows
that offset.  Note the brackets and their pins, those pins are where the heat
sink&#39;s pressure gets centred.  Also note how the thermal paste has been
squeezed away from that part, but is quite thick towards the left.

<p>
Here is a closeup on the heat sink, indicating how the off-centre mounting
squeezed the paste to one end.

This is the cleaned front side of the CPU.  Nothing much to see here, the visible damage is on its back.

<a name="REASONING"></a>
<h3>Reasoning</h3>
<p>
  We really don&#39;t know what is wrong here.  Let us list some observations and
  thoughts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> The ambient temperature was in both cases quite low.

  </li><li> These are supposedly top-quality motherboard (We&#39;ve had about 50 ASUS
  motherboard over the years, and only had one failure).

  </li><li> The offset mounting does not look right to us.  But this is how things
  are supposed to be done.

  </li><li> It is possible that we caused the 2nd CPU failure by inadequate mounting
  of the heat sink.  It surely seems bizarre to have the thermal paste squeezed
  like shown on the pictures above!

  </li><li> But note that the 1st failure happened with a more centred heat sink.
  We only made the off-centre mounting for the 2nd system as to minimise the
  risk of a repeated system failure.

  </li><li> The so-called TDP of the Ryzen 9950X is 170W.  The used heat sinks are
  specified to dissipate 165W, so that seems tight.  We have extra fans in the
  cases and a low ambient temperature, making these 5W seem negligible.  But of
  course, this is not completely kosher.

  </li><li> We have a sister system for the 9950X, a 7950X which is similarly
  configured and built.  That system actually seems to run slightly hotter, but
  it has been stable for a long time (under the same crazy load!).

  </li><li> The systems were under maximal load at the time their CPUs died, running
  very tight handcrafted asm loops sustaining one MULX per cycle.  That might
  be a &#34;hot&#34; instruction.

  </li><li> Did the CPUs die of heat stroke? Modern CPUs measure their temperature
  and clock down if they get too hot, don&#39;t they?

  </li><li> We don&#39;t overclock or overvolt or play other teen games with our
  hardware.

  </li><li> The extremely thin layer of thermal paste which resulted from the
  off-centre heat sink mount, might seem fine.  We however suspect that there
  might be a problem, as when the system heats and cools, things bend a little.
  With a remaining layer of thermal paste, such bending will not create any
  void as the paste&#39;s elasticity will maintain some contact.  When the thermal
  paste is squeezed away as with the suggested Noctua mounting, an
  ever-so-slight void between the CPU and the heat sink might be created.

  </li><li> Neither of the 9950X CPUs died immediately, instead they died the exact
  same way after a couple of months at high load.  This seems to suggest a
  gradual but predictable degradation.
</li></ul>
