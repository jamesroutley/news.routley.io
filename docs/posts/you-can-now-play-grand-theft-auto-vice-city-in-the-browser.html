    <h2>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</h2><p>The open-source implementation of the classic GTA engine, known as <strong>reVC</strong>, is now running directly in the browser. On DOS.Zone, you can explore a technology demo that showcases how this iconic game behaves in a modern web environment.</p><p>The engine has been completely reworked and carefully adapted to run smoothly inside the browser. Low-level systems such as rendering, input handling, audio, and file access were redesigned to work efficiently with WebAssembly and modern browser APIs, delivering stable performance without native installation.</p><h2><strong>Disclaimer</strong></h2><p>This project is an independent, non-commercial technology demonstration.
