<p dir="ltr"><span>We may have a new reason, in addition to vitamin D generation, to bask in a little sunshine.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A breakthrough study by University of Alberta researchers has shown the fat cells that lie just beneath our skin shrink when exposed to the blue light emitted by the sun.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#34;When the sun&#39;s blue light wavelengths-the light we can see with our eye-penetrate our skin and reach the fat cells just beneath, lipid droplets reduce in size and are released out of the cell. In other words, our cells don&#39;t store as much fat,&#34; said</span> <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/pharmacology/people/faculty/light-detail"><span>Peter Light</span></a><span>, senior author of the study, who is a professor of pharmacology and the director of the U of A&#39;s</span> <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/alberta-diabetes/"><span>Alberta Diabetes Institute</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#34;If you flip our findings around, the insufficient sunlight exposure we get eight months of the year living in a northern climate may be promoting fat storage and contributing to the typical weight gain some of us have over winter,&#34; added the Dr. Charles A. Allard Chair in Diabetes Research.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Light cautions the finding is only an initial observation and pursuing exposure to sunlight is not a safe or recommended way to lose weight.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#34;For example, we don&#39;t yet know the intensity and duration of light necessary for this pathway to be activated.&#34;</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Discovery raises more questions</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>However, he noted the discovery opens up new avenues of future scientific exploration which could someday lead to pharmacological or light-based treatments for obesity and other related health issues such as diabetes.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#34;Maybe this mechanism contributes to setting the number of fat cells we produce in childhood-thought to stay with us into adulthood,&#34; he speculated.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#34;Obviously, there is a lot of literature out there suggesting our current generation will be more overweight than their parents, and maybe this feeds into the debate about what is healthy sunshine exposure.&#34;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The researchers made the discovery while investigating how to bioengineer fat cells to produce insulin in response to light to help patients with Type 1 diabetes.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#34;It was serendipitous,&#34; said Light, adding that his name is an ironic coincidence since light is not his primary field of research. &#34;We noticed the reaction in human tissue cells in our negative control experiments, and since there was nothing in the literature, we knew it was important to investigate further.&#34;</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Connection to seasonal affective disorder?</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Based on these findings, the fat cells we store near our skin may be a peripheral biological clock, said Light.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#34;It&#39;s early days, but it&#39;s not a giant leap to suppose that the light that regulates our circadian rhythm, received through our eyes, may also have the same impact through the fat cells near our skin.&#34;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He explained that the molecular pathway they discovered was first identified as being activated by the eye when exposed to the blue wavelengths in sunlight.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#34;That&#39;s why you are not supposed to look at digital devices before bed, because they emit the same blue light the sun does, which signals us to wake up,&#34; he explained.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#34;Well, perhaps that pathway-exposure to sunlight that directs our sleep-wake patterns-may also act in a sensory manner, setting the amount of fat humans burn depending on the season. You gain weight in the winter and then burn it off in the summer.&#34;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This could be an evolutionary process, supported by the fact that, unlike many other mammals, our fat is spread out all over our bodies just underneath our skin, he added.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#34;Our initial observation certainly holds many fascinating clues for our team and others around the world to explore.&#34;</span></p>
