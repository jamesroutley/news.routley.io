<li>Using JavaScript in a Flask app: <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/patterns/javascript/">https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/patterns/javascript/</a></li>



<li>Not much visible progress on Slow Art Online, but I spent some time researching next steps and experimenting with different API calls in a different practice program where I am outputting results in the terminal. I’m planning to spend more time on this project and hopefully have a demo to show on Tuesday.</li>



<li>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volition_(psychology)">Wikipedia</a>: “<strong>Volition</strong>, also known as <strong>will</strong> or <strong>conation</strong>, is the cognitive process by which an individual decides on and commits to a particular course of action. It is defined as purposive striving and is one of the primary human psychological functions. Others include affect (feeling or emotion), motivation (goals and expectations), and cognition (thinking). Volitional processes can be applied consciously or they can be automatized as habits over time.”</li>



<li>Early on in the batch we had a <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/day-4-building-your-volitional-muscles/">workshop on volition</a> in the context of deciding what to do during our time at RC. Today’s workshop focused on volition in the context of career decisions. I think it’s so powerful to take the time to consider what you really want to do, and what steps you need to take to get there. I’ll continue to reflect on this as I move forward.</li>
