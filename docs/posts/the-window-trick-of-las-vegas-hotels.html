The Window Trick of Las Vegas Hotels

<p>When I lived in Hong Kong I often passed by a residential apartment complex commonly known as the &#34;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Building" target="_blank">monster building</a>&#34;. </p><p>_____</p><p>This housing estate, originally built in the 1960s, actually consists of five separate buildings: the Fook Cheong Building, the Montane Mansion, the Oceanic Mansion, the Yick Cheong Building, and the Yick Fat Building.</p><p>It has become a tourist attraction because of its very unique and - some might say - &#34;dystopian&#34; look. </p><p>Obviously, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so maybe you think that these buildings are pretty. In that case, good on you. But I guess there are also a lot of people who find them quite ugly.</p><p>One of the façades stood out to me in particular as being a massive, colossal mess. </p><p>Although this is an extreme example, there are plenty of &#34;monster buildings&#34; in Hong Kong, usually housing estates constructed in the 1960s and 1970s. They have a very specific aesthetic: they look large, thick and heavy, with grubby, boring façades cluttered with protruding AC units. </p><p>The 1960s and 1970s were the era of residential buildings that are, let&#39;s say, controversial. Some examples include the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit%C3%A9_d%27habitation" target="_blank">Unité d&#39;Habitation</a> by Le Corbusier, and the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trellick_Tower" target="_blank">Trellick Tower</a> in the UK. </p></div></div>
