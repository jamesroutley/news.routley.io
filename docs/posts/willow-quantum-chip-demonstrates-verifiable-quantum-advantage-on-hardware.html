It can compute the structure of a molecule, and paves a path towards real-world applications. Today’s advance builds on decades of work, and six years of major breakthroughs. Back in 2019, we</i> <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/what-our-quantum-computing-milestone-means/"><i>demonstrated</i></a><i> that a quantum computer could solve a problem that would take the fastest classical supercomputer thousands of years.

Last year, Willow proved its power with our Random Circuit Sampling benchmark, a test designed to measure maximum quantum state complexity. The Quantum Echoes algorithm represents a new class of challenge because it models a physical experiment. This means this algorithm tests not only for complexity, but also for precision in the final calculation. This is why we call it “quantum verifiable,” meaning the result can be cross-benchmarked and verified by another quantum computer of similar quality. To deliver both precision and complexity, the hardware must have two key traits: extremely low error rates and high-speed operations.</p>

One of the tools scientists use to understand chemical structure is Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), the same science behind MRI technology. NMR acts as a molecular microscope, powerful enough to let us see the relative position of atoms, which helps us understand a molecule’s structure. Modeling molecules’ shape and dynamics is foundational in chemistry, biology and materials science, and advances that help us do this better underpin progress in fields ranging from biotechnology to solar energy to nuclear fusion.</p><p data-block-key="7svu9">In a <a href="https://quantumai.google/static/site-assets/downloads/quantum-computation-molecular-geometry-via-nuclear-spin-echoes.pdf">proof-of-principle experiment</a> in partnership with The University of California, Berkeley, we ran the Quantum Echoes algorithm on our Willow chip to study two molecules, one with 15 atoms and another with 28 atoms, to verify this approach. The results on our quantum computer matched those of traditional NMR, and revealed information not usually available from NMR, which is a crucial validation of our approach.</p><p data-block-key="57iba">Just as the telescope and the microscope opened up new, unseen worlds, this experiment is a step toward a ‘quantum-scope’ capable of measuring previously unobservable natural phenomena. Quantum computing-enhanced NMR could become a powerful tool in drug discovery, helping determine how potential medicines bind to their targets, or in materials science for characterizing the molecular structure of new materials like polymers, battery components or even the materials that comprise our quantum bits (qubits).</p></div>
