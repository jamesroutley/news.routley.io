<p>It should probably not be a controversial opinion that, in late 2023 (and surely through most of 2024), one should not sell a pricey “Pro” computer with only 8GB of RAM. And yet here we are.</p>



<p>The least-expensive new MacBook Pro you can get costs $1,599 and includes only 8GB of RAM, an insultingly miserly amount for this day and age. Want more? That will be at least $200, take it or leave it.</p>



<p>Apple has a long history of providing less RAM than it should for the price of its laptops and overcharging to get more, but it’s reached ridiculous proportions. The <em>cheapest</em> standard configuration with more than 8GB of RAM is 2 grand! The cheapest MacBook Pro you can <em>configure</em> with more than 8GB is $1,800!</p>



<h2 id="yes-you-need-more-than-8gb">Yes, you need more than 8GB</h2>



<p>I will be the first chip nerd on the block to sing the praises of Apple’s M-series memory management. A big on-chip system-level cache and a fast SSD, along with some really smart code, means that a Mac with Apple Silicon doesn’t feel nearly as hamstrung with 8GB of RAM as, say, a Windows laptop.</p>

		
			
			


<p>That does not mean that 8GB is “enough,” though. Even relatively casual users who load up on browser tabs and inefficient <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.electronjs.org/apps&amp;xcust=1-1-2130071-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2130071/m3-macbook-pro-8gb-memory-too-little.html" rel="nofollow">Electron apps</a> (household names like Slack, Teams, Discord, etc.) can find performance compromised by running out of RAM.</p>

<p>As I write this, with just a handful of browser tabs open, Slack, and a distraction-free writing app (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://ia.net/writer&amp;xcust=1-1-2130071-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2130071/m3-macbook-pro-8gb-memory-too-little.html" rel="nofollow">iA Writer</a>—it’s great), I’m consuming just about 11GB on my M2 MacBook Air.</p>



<p>Is it a problem to sell a Mac with 8GB in 2023-2024? No. Is it a problem to sell a <em>MacBook Pro</em> for $1,600 with only 8GB of RAM? Oh god, yes. If 8GB will be a bottleneck for many today, imagine the performance of that non-upgradeable laptop in a few years’ time.</p>



<p>Not that Windows laptops and Macs are directly comparable, but comparably-priced Microsoft Surface, HP Envy, Alienware, Dell XP, and Lenovo Thinkpad laptops all have 16GB of RAM or more, standard. You can spend all day mired in laptop configurations (and I have) but the bottom line is this: 16GB is standard at prices over $1,000 even in laptops with premium displays and other high-end features. Apple is <em>way</em> off base with its RAM here, more so than usual, especially in products that carry the “Pro” name.</p>



<h2 id="the-upgrade-extortion">The upgrade extortion</h2>



<p>If you want more than 8GB, you have to pay for it. Either with a big $400 upgrade to the M3 Pro—which is not even an option in the just-released <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2126614/24-inch-imac-m3-review.html">M3 iMac</a>—or by paying Apple $200 for another 8GB.</p>



<p>To be clear, 8GB of LPDDR5-6400 (the RAM used in these products) costs Apple a tiny fraction of that amount. Nobody knows precisely what Apple pays its suppliers, but the going price for 64Gbits (8GB) of that sort of RAM is less than $40 in quantity. Apple’s deal likely has them paying $30 or less.</p>

<p>There’s nothing special about Apple’s RAM. It’s high quality, and it’s integrated on a very wide memory bus very close to the M3 chip, but those manufacturing complexities don’t make the RAM cost more. Apple’s charging you $200 for RAM it buys for $30.</p>



<p>Here’s a fun experiment: Configure a MacBook Pro with the M3 Max, the full 16-core CPU version. Every additional 16GB of RAM costs $200, the same as 8GB of RAM on the lower configurations.</p>



<p>Any time an upgrade carries a perfectly round price–<em>exactly</em> $200–you should be wary of it. Some product manager priced it by what “looks good” and what they think customers will pay.</p>



<p>In Apple’s case, you have no choice. You can’t upgrade later. You can’t pay anyone else’s price. You have to pay Apple’s exorbitant $200-for-8GB upgrade cost. Make no mistake: the true starting cost of a M3 MacBook Pro is $1,699 because to buy one with only 8GB of RAM is crazy.</p>



<h2 id="we-shouldnt-accept-this">We shouldn’t accept this</h2>



<p>Are the new M3 Macs great computers? Sure. Are they expensive? You betcha. Does any excuse for Apple’s stingy 8GB RAM configurations or highway-robbery RAM upgrade prices? Absolutely not. This is pure corporate greed from the world’s biggest and richest technology company, and as Apple customers, we shouldn’t stand for it.</p>
