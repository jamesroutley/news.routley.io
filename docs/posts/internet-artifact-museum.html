A map of ARPANET, the precursor to the internet, showing the 111
computer terminals connected to the network in 1977.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
ARPANET was created by the Department of Defense to allow
researchers to share information and resources. The network was
initially limited to universities and research institutions.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
By 1983, ARPANET had over 4,000 connected computers and a
growing number of e-mail users. The ARPANET completion report
concluded that &#34;the full impact of the technical changes set in
motion by this project may not be understood for many years.&#34;

The first spam email was sent by Gary Thuerk, a marketing
manager for the Digital Equipment Corporation. Thuerk sent the
email to 320 recipients on ARPANET, advertising a product
presentation of the new DECSYSTEM-20 mainframe computers.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
The reaction to the email was overwhelmingly negative: one user
claimed it broke his computer system, and the US Defense
Communications Agency called his company to complain. Thuerk
claims he sold $13 to $14 million worth of mainframe computers
through the campaign.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
The term &#34;spam&#34; would not be used until years later, after being
inspired by a Monty Python sketch.
</p></div> <p>
The first spam email was sent by Gary Thuerk to 397 recipients on
ARPANET to promote a new computer system.

The first recorded use of a smiley on the internet came in 1982,
when computer scientist Scott Fahlman proposed the use of :-)
and :-( to distinguish between jokes and serious posts online.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
The proposal came in response to a post on the Carnegie Mellon
University bulletin board, where a student joked that there was
a mercury spill in the physics department’s elevator. Other
students missed context for the joke and thought a spill
actually occurred.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
The smileys were slowly adopted throughout Carnegie Mellon and
later to the broader internet.

jokes, and folklore from the early internet. It became an
essential reference for hackers and computer scientists, and
helped shape early online culture.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
First created in 1975 by Raphael Finkel at Stanford&#39;s AI lab,
the dictionary quickly spread to MIT and eventually to the
broader internet community. It became a collaborative effort as
hackers and computer scientists crowdsourced new editions of the
dictionary to reflect the ever-changing culture.

Developed by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, Usenet was dubbed the
&#34;poor man’s ARPANET&#34; because it was more accessible to the
average person. The network allowed users to post messages and
articles in different topic-specific newsgroups.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Usenet had no central authority, instead news servers exchanged
articles with each other at set intervals. The platform quickly
evolved beyond its initial focus on technical topics, expanding
to host newsgroups ranging from music to philosophy.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
By 1985, around 375 articles were posted a day on Usenet to over
100 active newsgroups. The network helped shape early Internet
culture, popularizing terms like FAQ, flame wars, and spam.
</p></div> <p>
Usenet was a more accessible alternative to ARPANET, allowing
user&#39;s to share articles in topic-specific newsgroups.

The first ever MP3 was the a cappella version of &#34;Tom&#39;s Diner&#34;
by Suzanne Vega. Karlheinz Brandenburg, who worked on the MP3
format, used the song as a benchmark to see how the compression
algorithm would handle the human voice.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Instrumental music had been easier to compress, but Vega&#39;s voice
sounded distorted and unnatural in early versions of the format.
Brandenburg would end up making hundreds of tweaks to the MP3
compression algorithm to make Vega&#39;s voice clearer. He would
later even get to meet Suzanne Vega and hear the song performed
live.

On November 2nd, 1988, a computer worm was released onto the
internet. Created by Robert Tappan Morris, a 23-year-old Cornell
University graduate student, it was designed as an experiment to
measure the internet&#39;s size, but a programming error caused it
to propagate wildly. Within 24 hours, close to 10% of the 88,000
computers on the internet were disabled.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
After learning that his experiment had gone awry, Morris asked a
friend to anonymously relay an apology and instructions for
removing the worm to internet users, but ironically those most
impacted didn’t get his message because of the damage the worm
did to the network. Morris became the first person convicted
under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
</p></div> <p>
The Morris Worm was one of the first computer worms to spread on
the internet.

One of the earliest chain letters to spread on the internet was
titled &#34;Make Money Fast.&#34; It promised readers that they would
receive $50,000 in cash after sixty days if they followed the
given instructions.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
The letter worked like a pyramid scheme, where each person had
to pay those before them. It quickly spread through email and
Usenet groups after being posted by an unknown creator in 1988.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Many variations of the letter also spread with titles like &#34;Make
Beer Fast&#34;, making it an early internet meme.

Created by Jarkko Oikarinen as a side-project while working at
the University of Oulu in Finland, IRC, or Internet Relay Chat,
is a text-based communication protocol that lets users chat in
real-time group conversations, known as channels.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
The initial IRC server consisted mostly of Jarkko&#39;s friends, but
the protocol slowly spread when others started hosting their own
servers. Other schools, like Oregon State University also
started using the protocol. By mid-1989, around 40 servers
existed worldwide, and IRC was adopted by early internet
communities as a chat alternative to message boards.

The acronym &#34;LOL&#34; made its first documented appearance on the
internet in a FidoNet newsletter. FidoNet was a network of BBSs
- or bulletin board systems. Messages were transferred over
phone calls during off-peak hours to minimize toll costs.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
This edition of the FidoNet newsletter attempts to catalog the
increasing number of emoticons and acronyms that were spreading
on the network at the time. It also contained conventions that
never really caught on - like ODM for &#34;On De Move&#34;.

America Online debuted in 1991 and quickly became the largest

sound became many people&#39;s first introduction to the Internet.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Dial-up internet worked by using the existing telephone
infrastructure. Modems connected in a way similar to phone
conversations, with the dial-up sound serving as a handshake
between machines. The dial-up sound was a choreographed dance of
beeps and boops that exchanged all the information needed to
connect to the network.

and Elizabeth Vargas pondered the nature of the Internet,
debating the meaning of the @ symbol and asking, &#34;What is
internet, anyway?&#34;
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
At the time only 20 million people worldwide were using the
internet, with less than half of that having an email account.
Just 10 years after this news segment aired, the number of
internet users would reach more than a billion.

Created by 19-year-old Justin Hall, Justin&#39;s Links from the
Underground was one of the earliest blogs. Initially started to
post cool links he found online, Justin began sharing intimate
details of his life, including stories about his childhood, drug
experiences and love life.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Within a year, the blog had 27,000 daily readers—more than the
publication HotWired, where he was an intern. He became an early
internet celebrity and blogged about the struggles of internet
fame.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Justin also became an early advocate for blogging - creating
free tutorials on HTML so others could make their own blogs.

Yahoo! was created by Jerry Yang and David Filo, two Stanford
graduate students. Initially just lists of interesting links
called <i data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">&#34;Jerry&#39;s Guide to the World Wide Web&#34;</i>, it took
off when they created a program to combine them.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Once the guide started getting 50,000 daily hits, they realized
it needed a better name and rebranded to Yahoo! (an acronym for
Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle).
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Initially the two programmers manually added links, but as the
web grew they hired full-time &#34;surfers&#34; to browse and categorize
the internet. Eventually 1,000 sites were being added a day.
They later pitched the site to investors as a &#34;TV Guide for the
internet.&#34;

In 1994, the Clinton administration launched the first-ever

an option to email the President, and virtual tours of the White
House.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
The rollout was successful, although initially delayed to find
images and audio of Socks the Cat, the First Family&#39;s pet.
Although only 1 in 10 Americans had access to the Internet at
the time, the number of visitors to the White House website more
than tripled annually throughout Clinton&#39;s tenure.

Launched in 1994, Geocities was a website hosting service with a
unique twist. Instead of just hosting websites, the site
consisted of virtual &#34;neighborhoods&#34; that let users decide where
to setup their page. There was the &#34;Hollywood&#34; neighborhood for
fan and celeb sites and &#34;Area51&#34; for science fiction and
fantasy. Geocities had an interactive 2D map, allowing users to
navigate through these virtual spaces.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
For new internet users, this virtual representation of the real
world helped make the complexities of the internet more
understable and fun. It created an easy way to discover new
content and people, and gave many their first virtual &#34;home&#34; on
the internet.

Originally set up as an experiment to provide slice-of-life
views of the campus, it quickly became a beloved fixture of the
early internet. At one point, the webcam even had a chat room
where users could discuss the weather.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
The webcam was almost shut down in 2019, but a public outcry
kept it alive. It has now been streaming for 29 years.

Created by 28-year old Pierre Omidyar, AuctionWeb was an early
e-commerce platform that let people list items for sale to the
highest bidder. Omidyar wanted to create a platform that allowed
people to be producers as well as consumers. The very first item
sold was a broken laser pointer, which sold for $14.83.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
AuctionWeb was soon generating $10,000 a month, but the site’s
large traffic also prompted an increase in web hosting fees,
leading Omidyar to leave his day job and begin taking a
percentage of each transaction to fund the site that became
Ebay.

A rag-tag group of five New York City-based designers and

One of the biggest early internet memes, the
<i data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">Dancing Baby</i> was the unintentional result of a plugin

Created by applying the plugin&#39;s <i data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">Cha-Cha dance</i> animation
to the 3D model of a baby, the resulting animation was first
discarded for being too &#34;disturbing.&#34;

The animation found a second life when it was recreated from the

after being set to the song <i data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">&#34;Hooked on a Feeling&#34;</i>. It

squatting when he realized McDonalds.com was available. He
reached out to McDonald&#39;s media relations to ask why they

Beanie Babies were an early internet sensation. Created by Ty
Warner in 1993, the plush animals were priced between $5 and $7
and slightly understuffed with plastic pellets. The plushies
were only sold in specialty shops, and different characters were
frequently retired, making them highly collectible.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
The website URL was placed on the hangtags of the beanie babies,
an unusual move at the time but one that paid off. The mania
began when a group of suburban moms near Chicago started calling
stores nationwide to track down the rarest characters. By May
1997, Beanie Babies accounted for 6% of eBay&#39;s total annual
sales ($500 million), before the bubble finally burst at the
turn of the millennium.

Japanese companies took the first steps in the late 1990s to
develop emojis for mobile devices. The first set of 90 emojis
was released by J-Phone (now SoftBank Mobile) on the SkyWalker
DP-211SW phone in November 1997.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
The phone did not sell well, and emojis could only be shared
between users of that specific model, limiting their spread.
Despite the sluggish start, a later version of SoftBank&#39;s
emoji set became the foundation for Apple&#39;s emojis that
appeared with the release of iOS 2 in 2008 and that led to the
their standardization by Unicode in 2010.

Early computer programs only stored the last two digits of the
year to save on expensive storage space. With the year 2000
approaching, there was a frenzied effort to fix programs that
would break when the new millennium started.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Alarmists predicted failing banks, plummeting airplanes, and
nuclear plant disasters. Some people stockpiled gas masks and
food. To cushion against a potential financial crisis, the
Federal Reserve pumped an extra $50 billion into circulation.
But when the new year rolled around, the world breathed a
collective sigh of relief as the proactive work of programmers
had paid off, averting widespread catastrophes.

Appearing in 1997, Ask Jeeves revolutionized search by allowing
users to make queries with natural language. Co-founded by
Garrett Gruener and David Warthen, the duo started with $250,000
and named the site after P.G. Wodehouse’s all-knowing butler.
The search engine rapidly gained traction, handling over a
million queries daily within two years of launching.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Unlike traditional search engines, Ask Jeeves used semantic
analysis to sort questions into one of about 10,000 basic

responses, ensuring the database remained up-to-date.

a tribute to her pet hamster, affectionately dubbed &#34;Hampton the
Hampster&#34;. The page was created as part of a competition to see
whose website could garner the most views between her friends
and sister.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
By the end of 1999, an estimated 17 million people had visited
the page. The site&#39;s popularity spawned a wave of imitators,
including websites featuring dancing cows, fish, and amoebas. An
official Hampster Dance song was released in 2000 and reached #1
on the Canadian charts.

Originally called BackRub, Google began as a research project by
Stanford PhD students Larry Page and Sergey Brin aimed at
crawling the 10 million websites on the web at the time. In
March 1996, they pointed their crawler at a Stanford webpage and
let it crawl the internet outward from there.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Their main breakthrough was the PageRank algorithm, which
measured the quantity and quality of links to and from a site.
The duo quickly realized that their search results outperformed
existing engines like AltaVista and Excite. Working initially
from their dorm rooms, they continually expanded the service, at
one point consuming nearly half of Stanford’s network bandwidth.

Founded by 19-year-old Shawn Fanning, Napster was a
revolutionary peer-to-peer service that allowed users to share
MP3s. Fanning conceived the idea in his dorm room at
Northeastern University after hearing his roommate complain
about dead MP3 links. By 2000, Napster had grown to more than 20
million users, with about 14,000 songs downloaded every minute.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Napster&#39;s rapid rise terrified the music industry. The RIAA, or
Record Industry Association of America, started sueing
individuals for downloading songs from Napster. Metallica was
the first individual band to sue, with Dr. Dre following soon
after. The legal onslaught led to Napster ceasing operations in
2001.

With fewer than half a million DVD players sold worldwide,
Netflix launched in 1998 with an initial library of more than
900 movies. They were able to target early adopters of DVDs
since most video stores didn&#39;t stock them yet.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
The idea for Netflix came while co-founders Reed Hastings and
Marc Randolph were carpooling. They initially thought of letting
people rent VHS tapes online, but VHS was too expensive and
delicate to ship. A few months later, they read about a new
format called DVD and dusted off the idea. They mailed a used CD
to Hastings’s home and realized idea could work when it arrived
intact.

Understanding the need to pivot, in 2001 they launched

Launched by Jonathan Abrams in 2003, Friendster became an early
social media sensation, quickly amassing three million users.
Its rise came after several failed attempts in social networking
during the late ’90s, like Six Degrees. Serving as a blueprint
for future platforms, Friendster attracted notable early users
like Matthew McConaughey and even Mark Zuckerberg.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
However, as it grew in popularity, the platform faced
significant technical challenges, like unbearable load times.
Only a few months after Friendster launched, MySpace came out
with many of the same features, taking away Friendster&#39;s
momentum.

In the spring of 2003, Tom Anderson saw the rise of platforms
like Friendster and felt that it was a missed opportunity to
create a more creative platform. He conceived of MySpace as a
place where users could express themselves, even allowing custom
HTML and CSS on users&#39; profiles.

The platform first gained traction in the Los Angeles music
scene, where bands used the site to promote their songs. As the

In 2004, the Motion Picture Association of America and the
Federation Against Copyright Theft launched the
<i data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">&#34;You Wouldn’t Steal a Car&#34;</i> campaign, an anti-piracy
public service announcement displayed before movies on DVDs.
Aimed at deterring online movie piracy, the initiative coincided
with Hollywood’s first-ever lawsuits against individuals
suspected of sharing movies online.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Despite its serious intent, the ad became the subject of
widespread mockery through memes and parodies. It was also later
found out that, ironically, the ad’s music was used without the
creator’s permission.

In December 2004, 19-year-old Gary Brolsma uploaded a webcam
video titled &#34;Numa Numa,&#34; featuring himself lip-syncing to the
Romanian song <i data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">&#34;Dragostea Din Tei&#34;</i> by O-Zone. Hosted
initially on Newgrounds.com, Brolsma created the video after
watching a cartoon about Japanese cats.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
Even before the existence of YouTube, his video exploded one
night after Newgrounds featured it on their front page. A couple
days later, Brolsma woke up to find news vans from all the major
networks parked outside his house, forcing him to explain his
sudden Internet fame to his surprised mother.

In 2005, 21-year-old Alex Tew from Wiltshire, England, devised a
unique way to pay for college: The Million Dollar Homepage. Tew
sold 1,000,000 pixels on the page for $1 each or $100 for a
10-by-10 pixel block, turning them into tiny digital billboards
for advertisers.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
The ads ranged from mainstream outlets like The Times of London
to more niche sites, like online casinos. The site received
200,000 unique visitors daily within the first month. The last
1,000 pixels were auctioned off for $38,100, earning Tew a total
of $1,037,100 from the stunt. Tew ended up dropping out after
his first semester, saying school wasn&#39;t for him.

Initially conceived as a dating site, YouTube pivoted to online
entertainment just as conditions became ripe for widespread
video sharing, like the emergence of widespread broadband
access. By its official launch on December 15, 2005, YouTube was
already serving over two million video views per day.

In the summer of 2005, two college students joined the first
cohort of Y Combinator with $12,000 of seed money. They pivoted
from their original idea of a phone-based food ordering system
to create Reddit, envisioned as the &#34;front page of the
Internet.&#34; The site consisted of a simple list of links that
users could vote on, making it a collaborative popularity
contest.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
The founders initially created fake posts under fake profiles to
make the platform appear livelier. At first, there were no
subreddits and all posts were mixed together. They eventually
created the first subreddit to separate NSFW content from the
main page.

as an SMS-based platform for friends to share status updates. It
was called &#34;twttr,&#34; since it was cool at the time remove vowels

In its early days, amidst a world dominated by flip phones,

On January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone as a
&#34;widescreen iPod,&#34; a &#34;revolutionary phone,&#34; and a &#34;breakthrough
Internet communicator&#34;. Although the crowd didn&#39;t seem as
excited about the internet communicator part, it ended up
becoming by far the most revolutionary feature—the device would
re-shape the internet.
</p> <p data-v-200d9b1b="" data-v-3a470780="">
It forced a redesign of web interfaces to become responsive and
minimalistic. Flash began a slow death as it wasn&#39;t supported.
Social media went mobile-first, and became all-encompassing. An
era of the internet had ended, and a new one began.
