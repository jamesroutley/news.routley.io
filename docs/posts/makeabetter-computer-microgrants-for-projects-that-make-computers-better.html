      Computers were supposed to be <em>&#34;bicycles for the mind&#34;</em> and help us <em>&#34;augment human intellect&#34;</em>, but we&#39;ve lost track of this original vision. We want to find our way back. Makeabetter.computer is a microgrants program focused on people working on projects that make computers better.
