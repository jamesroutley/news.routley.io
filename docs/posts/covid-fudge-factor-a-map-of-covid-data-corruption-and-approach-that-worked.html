There’s now a lot of black (meaning it’s off-the-charts high.)</p><p>Some takeaways:</p><p><strong>— Eastern Europe massively under-reported Covid deaths.</strong><span> The map shows that the western countries with more advanced medical systems, less corruption, and higher vaccination rates, did much better. To take one example: Russia reported 2,092 Covid deaths per million people, but suffered 7,390 excess deaths in the Covid era.</span></p><p>Interestingly, awful Covid performance almost precisely traces the line of the old Soviet iron curtain.</p><p><span>I spent 1.5 years in ex-Iron-Curtain countries during the Covid era, and people there acted less concerned about crowded indoor spaces and sneezing — and more concerned about surfaces. And everyone seemed to fear that getting physically cold would lead to colds. That was a longstanding notion in the west, too, but I think now most </span><strong><a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/publications/health-matters/myth-masher-cracking-the-case-on-colds#:~:text=Myth%3A%20You&#39;ll%20catch%20a,the%20major%20cause%20of%20colds." rel="">realize it’s actually not a big factor</a></strong><span>. In addition, the culture in ex-Iron-Curtain countries places more value on toughness, and less on safety.</span></p><p>Of course, one can argue that more deaths in non-restrictive countries were worth it for more freedom. But first let’s be clear with ourselves that freedom failed to prevent deaths.</p><p><strong>— The United States was roughly around the global average</strong><span>. Contrary to the view of many conservatives, the deaths probably were caused by Covid itself, and NOT by lockdowns, considering that:</span></p><p><strong>— Australia and New Zealand had many </strong><em><strong>fewer</strong></em><strong> deaths during Covid than pre-Covid, making them green on the map</strong><span>. Their ultra-strict lockdowns may have reduced driving and flu deaths, while also keeping Covid levels minimal. Norway, Japan, and Mongolia kept their net effects to zero; all achieved that with long-lasting near-total travel bans on entering their countries. </span></p><p><strong>— Equatorial Africa really did have low Covid deaths</strong><span>, based on Kenya and Togo. This is surely assisted by Africa’s ultra-young population; </span><a href="https://www.populationpyramid.net/africa/2020/" rel="">just</a><span> 3.4% of Africans are over age 65. Also, obesity in both countries </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_obesity_rate" rel="">is</a><span> less than one-quarter of the US obesity rate.</span></p><p><span>In South Africa, which performed poorly on Covid, 6% </span><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS?locations=ZA-US" rel="">are</a><span> over 65, and their obesity rate is nearly 80% as bad as the US level.</span></p><p>Finally — I think common sense tells us that the numbers in the excess mortality map are far more plausible than those in the map with the official data. </p><p><span>Now for my favorite map! We can compare the above two graphs to each other, to estimate </span><em>how reliable each government’s statistics are</em><span>, by taking the ratio of officially-reported deaths, to the excess total deaths.</span></p><p>For example, Russia has 3.5 times more excess deaths than offically-reported ones, so it gets a score of 3.5.</p><p>Call it a “fudge factor”:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf18f132-0067-4cdd-b953-e455d3020b76_3452x2008.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf18f132-0067-4cdd-b953-e455d3020b76_3452x2008.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf18f132-0067-4cdd-b953-e455d3020b76_3452x2008.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf18f132-0067-4cdd-b953-e455d3020b76_3452x2008.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf18f132-0067-4cdd-b953-e455d3020b76_3452x2008.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf18f132-0067-4cdd-b953-e455d3020b76_3452x2008.png" width="1456" height="847" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bf18f132-0067-4cdd-b953-e455d3020b76_3452x2008.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:847,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:938438,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf18f132-0067-4cdd-b953-e455d3020b76_3452x2008.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf18f132-0067-4cdd-b953-e455d3020b76_3452x2008.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf18f132-0067-4cdd-b953-e455d3020b76_3452x2008.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf18f132-0067-4cdd-b953-e455d3020b76_3452x2008.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Takeaways:</p><p><strong>— The 7 countries in black have off-the-charts “fudging” of their Covid statistics.</strong><span> Belarus, for example, has a fudge factor of 8.7, which means it had about 8.7 times more Covid deaths than were officially reported!

However, it must also be noted that suicide rates </span><em>did not rise</em><span> — actually </span><strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db433.htm#section_1" rel="">they fell</a></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>It must also be noted that the US and most countries in the world </span><em>also</em><span> sometimes did the above, but because they weren’t fully committed to keeping Covid out (travel bans) it was not very effective. </span></p><p><span>Most obnoxious have been the half-hearted rules that make no visible difference in saving lives: forcing preschoolers to mask up while nightclubs are left open, </span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hospital-cancels-kidney-transplant-donor-covid-unvaccinated-ohio-1637971" rel="">denying</a><span> life-saving kidney treatment to unvaccinated people despite minimal impact of vaccines on spread, shutting down small businesses while keeping crowded busses operating, etc. Rules like those happened all over the world, and were stupid, unscientific, and cruel.</span></p><p><span>How about the cost of the serious restrictions to </span><em><strong>prosperity</strong></em><span>? Looking at </span><a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD" rel="">GDP by year</a><span>, there is no visible correlation between travel bans/lockdowns and GDP.
