    <h1>Just Write</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I just finished listening to a podcast about Lena Dunham. I didn&#39;t know anything about her, have never seen any of her work and maybe never will. But the episode ended with these words of wisdom by her:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t wanna tell you what to do, but I know it works, so I say it as plainly as I can: Just write, keep on writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s so true! Just keep writing and writing and writing...</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a blog.</li>
<li>Post a comment.</li>
<li>Keep a diary.</li>
<li>Wite on a napkin.</li>
<li>Write one sentence.</li>
<li>Write a poem.</li>
<li>Describe your surroundings.</li>
<li>Write a review.</li>
<li>Write down your dreams.</li>
<li><a href="https://robert.bearblog.dev/rethinking-resistance/">Write about having nothing to write.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how you do it, just keep doing it. The same mindset can be applied to just about any kind of creative work ... even though it might be hard to write a symphony on a napkin.</p>
<p>Equally important, if not even more so, do it <em>because you love it</em>. Like a piece of your being is missing if you don&#39;t. Nothing wrong with having dreams and ambitions to be successful, but if that&#39;s your main goal, you&#39;ll never be satisfied â€” not even if you &#34;make it&#34;.</p>
