    <h1>Self-Serve Dashboards</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Sales pitches are the only place where “self-serve dashboards&#34; work. In the real world, it&#39;s a different story.</p>
<p>That story usually starts with an engineer or data scientist who&#39;s frustrated because they spend too much time writing queries and preparing dashboards for business people. They think that if they make BI easy enough, everyone will be able to “self-serve”, but that rarely ever happens.</p>
<p>What actually happens is that engineers and data scientists end up being the only people using the &#34;self-serve&#34; BI tool, which, ironically, makes it not self-serve at all.</p>
