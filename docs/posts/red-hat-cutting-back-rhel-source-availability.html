    <h1>Red Hat cutting back RHEL source availability</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
Red Hat has <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/furthering-evolution-centos-stream">announced</a>
that public source releases will be restricted to CentOS Stream going
forward:
</p><blockquote>
	As the CentOS Stream community grows and the enterprise software
	world tackles new dynamics, we want to sharpen our focus on CentOS
	Stream as the backbone of enterprise Linux innovation. We are
	continuing our investment in and increasing our commitment to
	CentOS Stream. <b>CentOS Stream will now be the sole repository for
	public RHEL-related source code releases</b>. For Red Hat customers
	and partners, source code will remain available via the Red Hat
	Customer Portal.
</blockquote>
