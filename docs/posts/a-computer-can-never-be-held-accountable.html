<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/bumblebike/status/832394003492564993">A computer can never be held accountable</a></strong>. This legendary page from an internal IBM training in 1979 could not be more appropriate for our new age of AI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A computer can never be held accountable</strong></p>
<p><strong>Therefore a computer must never make a management decision</strong></p>

<p>Back in June 2024 I <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1798168995373498524">asked on Twitter</a> if anyone had more information on the original source.</p>
<p>Jonty Wareing <a href="https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1798170111058264280">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was found by someone going through their father&#39;s work documents, and subsequently destroyed in a flood.</p>
<p>I spent some time corresponding with the IBM archives but they can&#39;t locate it. Apparently it was common for branch offices to produce things that were not archived.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1727344374370222264">the reply</a> Jonty got back from IBM:</p>
<p><img alt="Dear Jonty Wareing, This is Max Campbell from the IBM Corporate Archives responding to your request. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve searched the collection several times for this presentation and I am unable to find it. I will take another look today and see if I can find it, but since there is so little information to go on, l&#39;m not sure I will be successful. Sincerely, Max Campbell, Reference Desk, IBM Corporate Archives, 2455 South Rd, Bldg 04-02 Room CSC12, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/jonty-reply.jpeg"/></p>
<p>I believe the image was first shared online in <a href="https://twitter.com/bumblebike/status/832394003492564993">this tweet</a> by @bumblebike in February 2017. Here&#39;s where they confirm <a href="https://twitter.com/bumblebike/status/1385690727330451457">it was from 1979 internal training</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/bumblebike/status/1468346709994582020">another tweet from @bumblebike</a> from December 2021 about the flood:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately destroyed by flood in 2019 with most of my things.  Inquired at the retirees club zoom last week, but thereâ€™s almost no one the right age left. Not sure where else to ask.</p>
