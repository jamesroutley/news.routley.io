These are difficult decisions, which do not reflect on our employees&#39; dedication and hard work but are needed to ensure the business can compete and improve profitability over time,&#34; a spokesperson for GE Renewable Energy told CNBC.</p><p>GE is said to be examining its onshore wind footprint in Europe and Asia as well.</p><p>GE&#39;s renewable energy business faces a trifecta of challenges: Rising input costs, supply chain issues and competition from the likes of <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-2"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SIEGY/">Siemens</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>. While demand for clean energy options is rising as energy shortages continue to wreak havoc, analysts say it&#39;s been difficult to make wind energy a cost-effective option. The recently passed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/inflation-reduction-act-climate-change-provisions.html">Inflation Reduction Act</a> does restore a tax credit for onshore wind, but some experts worry it came too late.</p><p>According to analysis from Melius Research, GE&#39;s renewables segment is going to generate between $15 billion and $16 billion in revenue this year, and onshore wind will make up the vast majority, roughly 70%.</p><p>Jake Levinson, director at Melius Research, said there is pressure to get the renewables business in a better place before it makes the split. &#34;Shareholder interest in a money-losing or marginally profitable business would likely be very low, even in a &#34;hot&#34; space like renewables.&#34;</p><p>Meanwhile, General Electric is in the process of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/ge-to-break-up-into-3-companies-focusing-on-aviation-healthcare-and-energy.html">splitting into three publicly traded companies</a>, focused on health care, aerospace and energy.</p></div></div></div>
