    <h1>Ask HN: Am I the only one baffled by the long term usage of Twitter?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I am on and off Twitter for years now. I tried to build a following, went until around 2k followers, but than got sick of constantly thinking if &#34;thing x&#34; in daily live is worth tweeting.<p>I deleted my account, but then created a new one because some tweets and threads were more easily viewable with an account. This lead to build a more serious Twitter profile again.</p><p>However, I realised the actual ROI of using Twitter is so negative, it&#39;s shocking. Even interesting threads turn out to be half-wrong. I see takes from 10k+ follower accounts who are not well researched, one sided and all. Tech twitter things just because they are good at programming, they have a valid view on topic Y.</p><p>Now this is all common knowledge I believe. But Jesus, I stumbled across accounts which I used to follow, and these people post still every few hours or days the same take on public outcry and nothing changed. They do this for 8+ years now, you can scroll back by years and it&#39;s the same over and over again.</p><p>I wonder if someone has a take which changes my mind or what makes them do this stupid things? Imagine looking back on your life when you are 60 and seeing that you tweeted stuff with no effect WHAT SO EVER and you did this for 30 years of your life. Isn&#39;t this so depressing?</p></td></div></div>
