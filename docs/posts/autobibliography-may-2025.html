<p><em>Another highly-curated, lightly-annotated list of
recommendations. Previous autobibliography: <a href="https://hannahilea.com/autobibliography-1/">Feb 2025</a></em></p>
<p><em>For the last week I’ve been recovering from a medical thing,
which has involved very little Doing and a whole lot of Resting™—in my
doctor’s words, I’m only supposed to be doing “the activities of daily
living.” Easier said than done! It’s pretty weird to feel mentally fine
but physically exhausted, which is different than my typical
brain-plus-body exhaustion when ill.</em></p>
<p><em>Anyway, I’ve done a fair bit of media consumption during this
time, and now that I have a bit more energy it feels like a good time
for a link dump!</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Video game <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.albawildlife.com/">Alba:
A Wildlife Adventure</a></strong></p>
<p>You are a young girl visiting your grandparents on their
Mediterranean island for the week. You run around taking photos of
birds, cleaning up trash, and advocating for environmental
restoration.</p>
<p>It is beautiful and calming to look at and listen to, and easy to
play. This was my second time through, and it was just as delightful as
the first. If you are a person who doesn’t consider themselves a game
person, Alba may change your mind. (h/t DK)</p></li>

<p>This game is the daily bane of my existence, in a good way. Every
day, there’s a new Wikipedia page to identify, word by grueling word.
The healthy way to play is to stop when you’ve guessed the Wikipedia
page. Or you can keep going to try to guess <em>all</em> the words. 🙃
Luckily, there’s only one new entry to guess every 24 hours? (h/t

<p>I really appreciate Victoria’s take, drawn from experience as both a
software engineer and an artist. A few favorite excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I offer, then, a crude heuristic: I believe that the decisions you
make in your drawing – conscious and unconscious – are the vehicle by
which your soul, or aliveness, or intention, or WHATEVER, is infused in
your creation. And I believe you need to make the vast majority of the
decisions that compose a piece of art for you to claim it as your
own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you lie to my face and I believe you, does the lie somehow become
“valid” because I’m fooled by it? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not want to live in a mirage either.</p></li>

<p>I haven’t read all of it yet, but the bits I have read are great, and
it seems like a good primer for anyone working a job that involves
data—analysis, model training, etc—and <em>especially</em> for those of
us who didn’t go through engineering schools with “engineering ethics”
coursework. If I were assembling a research or engineering team, I think
portions of this handbook would be suggested reading.</p>

<p>We saw them play at Passim recently, and it was the best show I’d
been to in a long time. Their band is similarly excellent. Would
recommend catching a live show, if you can!</p>
