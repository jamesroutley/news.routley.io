    <h1>Do Not Put Your Site Behind Cloudflare If You Don&#39;t Need To</h1>

<p>At the time of writing 12:43 UTC on Tue 18 Nov, Cloudflare has taken many sites down.
I&#39;m trying to browse the web, but about half of the sites show an error:</p>
<p><img src="https://huijzer.xyz/files/45b312b038ccdc65" alt="cloudflare.webp"/></p>
<p>Most of these sites are not even that big.
I expect maybe a few thousand visitors per month.</p>
<p>This demonstrates again a simple fact: if you put your site behind a centralized service, then this service is a single point of failure.
Even large established companies make mistakes and can go down.</p>
<p>Most people use Cloudflare because they have been scared into the idea that you need DDoS protection.
Well, maybe you do, but probably you don&#39;t.</p>
<p>As they say in security, &#34;no one will burn a zero day on you!&#34;.
For your small blog with one hundred visitors per month, it&#39;s probably the same:
&#34;no one will burn their DDoS capabilities on you!&#34;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how else to say it.
Many people keep talking about the importance of a decentralized web, and then continue putting their site behind Cloudflare.</p>
<p>If you really want to be safe in case your server goes down, then setup a second version of your site at another location and point to that server via the A and AAAA records, see &#34;round-robin DNS&#34;.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#39;s the core of this message.
Face your fears.
Put your service on the internet.
Maybe it goes down, but at least not by yet another Cloudflare outage.</p>
