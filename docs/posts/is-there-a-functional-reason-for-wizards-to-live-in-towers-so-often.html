<p>The concept of wizard towers seems to predate D&amp;D, but has there been a functional reason for this added to D&amp;D? I&#39;m going to be using the answer specifically in 5e, but wizard towers transcend versions of the game so I don&#39;t believe this question is specific to 5e.</p>
<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/91uajj/why_do_wizards_like_having_tall_towers/" rel="noreferrer">I&#39;ve found this old popular Reddit thread</a> which mostly has some joke responses with a few references to potential historical sources of the concept of wizard towers, but nothing notable that is &#34;functional&#34; in the sense of aiding a wizard practically.</p>
<p>In an episode of Critical Role Campaign 2, the DM referenced the fact that a good number of spells require arcane circles in the ground and that this is why wizards lean towards towers. This is cool, but I can&#39;t find any references to this being the <em>why</em> and it doesn&#39;t really explain the need for any sort of height.</p>
<p>Is there a <em>functional</em> reason for wizards to use towers so often? Or is it just a cultural/traditional thing wizards do?</p>
<p>For example: in one of the most common 5e modules to exist, The Lost Mines of Phandelver there is a wizards tower in Thundertree.</p>
<p>For clarification: is there a first-party reference that would explain why wizards often use towers? Some possible answers if they were supported by sources: they&#39;re particularly easy for wizards to create, they&#39;re particularly good for wizards to research magic, or the height advantage is a great compliment to some class feature.</p>
<p><strong>MOD EDIT:</strong> This question <em>is not</em> looking for speculation or historical reasons. Answers should directly quote a D&amp;D book that gives a benefit to wizards for living in a tower.</p>

<h2>There is no functional reason, it&#39;s a trope</h2>
<p>You have tagged your question specifically for <a href="https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dnd-5e" title="show questions tagged &#39;dnd-5e&#39;" rel="tag">dnd-5e</a> and <a href="https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dungeons-and-dragons" title="show questions tagged &#39;dungeons-and-dragons&#39;" rel="tag">dungeons-and-dragons</a>. 5e does not have any functional rules mechanics (that I am aware of) that specifically are related to a tower for the wizard class.</p>
<p>There <em>can</em> be reasons why it is advantageous for wizards to live in towers: you can see much further, and blast approaching enemies with <em>fireball</em> before they can get close. You can have an alchemical laboratory with all kinds of stinking gases and concoctions, high above the roofs of the city, where those will be diffused by the wind and do not alienate your neighbors. And you can watch the stars from your roof, far above the fog of the surrounding countryscape.</p>
<p>I believe that the trope of the wizard, as a wise man, historically goes back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy" rel="noreferrer">stargazers in Mesopotamia</a>, who used towers for the last of the above cited reasons. (See also: <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageTower" rel="noreferrer">TVtropes&#39; Mage Tower</a>)</p>
<h3>Addendum: Spells that work well with a tower shape</h3>
<p>There is the spell <em>guards and wards</em> that has an extra effect in stairs being filled with webs that gets benefits from a structure with lots of staircases, such as a tower.</p>
<p>And a tower has less need for windows and doors on ground level, making it cheaper to secure against less determined thieves with spells like <em>wizard lock</em>.</p>
<p>You could create a tower cheaply by casting one or multiple <em>wall of stone</em> spells (although I’m not sure of the static calculations - maybe need to double wall for thickness), then having carpenters come in to put in doors and staircases.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a secondary question buried in the first one: Why towers at all?</p>
<p>Historically, towers exist for two reasons: to provide a field of vision, and to provide a field of fire. A tower provides a commanding view of the surrounding land, and vastly increases the area that can be hit with projectiles, both of which were very important in a defensive structure. (And still are, really.)</p>
<p>A tower could also provide space for living, storage, or prisoners, but that&#39;s really a secondary purpose, because once you&#39;ve gone to the trouble to enclose a large vertical space, you don&#39;t want to waste all that interior volume.</p>
<p>So why would a wizard want a tower?  Presumably the reasons are the same: a tower gives the wizard a direct line of sight and effect to a large area, which tends to be important in the spellcasting rules.</p>

<p>I would like to offer another &#34;fluff&#34; reason why wizards live in towers.  This depends on the setting, of course, but it may be that <strong>wizards are the only people who can <em>build</em> tall towers.</strong></p>
<p>Any tower is a nontrivial feat of structural engineering, and the taller it is, the harder it gets.  Non-magical stonemasonry tops out at about 150 meters.  <em>Everyday</em> stone structures (as opposed to unique projects like the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Hagia Sophia, and the Kanishka Stupa) tend to only go to 50 or 60m, partly because it takes incredibly thick walls to support anything taller (these are an acceptable cost for a cathedral but not an apartment block) and partly because nobody wants to climb more than a few flights of stairs on a daily basis.  Modern skyscrapers only became a thing after the invention of structural steel and elevators.</p>
<p>When wizards build tall towers for their homes, therefore, they are showing off their magical ability and knowledge — both by being able to build something that tall in the first place, and by having enough magic at their disposal that they can casually <em>levitate</em> or <em>teleport</em> around the place rather than climbing endless stairs.</p>
