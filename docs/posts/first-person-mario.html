  Mario. An inscrutable cartoon figure, beloved by many, but understood by few. To delve into the depths of this Italian plumber&#39;s psyche, to truly understand the man behind the mustache, we decided that we needed to see the world from his eyes.
</p>
<p>
  The world that Mario inhabited in his early years is different from ours in many ways, but foremost among them is that it is 2-dimensional. This means that Mario only sees in 1 dimension. When you, the player, see a goomba coming from a whole screen away, and can carefully track its movement, Mario sees only a brown line, terrifyingly wobbling towards him.
