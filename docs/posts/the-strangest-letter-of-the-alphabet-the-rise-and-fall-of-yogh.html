And it’s not a good one. </p><p><span>It’s full of silent letters, as in </span><em><span>num</span><strong>b</strong></em><span>, </span><em><strong>k</strong><span>nee</span></em><span>, and </span><em><strong>h</strong><span>onour</span></em><span>. A given sound can be spelled in multiple ways (</span><em><strong>f</strong><span>arm</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>lau</span><strong>gh</strong></em><span>, </span><em><strong>ph</strong><span>oto</span></em><span>), and many letters make multiple sounds (</span><em><strong>g</strong><span>et</span></em><span>, </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>ist</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>mira</span><strong>g</strong><span>e</span></em><span>).</span></p><p>English spelling is so complex that we’ve made mastering it into a competitive sport: what would be the point of a spelling bee in a language with a predictable spelling system? Where’s the fun unless you have to sweat a little as you struggle to recall whether this particular word is one where “‘i’ before ‘e’ except after ‘c’” doesn’t apply?</p><p>In short, English has a complicated writing system.</p><p><span>I’ve written about the origin of some of this complexity before, blaming everyone from </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/why-english-doesnt-use-accents" rel="">the French</a><span> to </span><a href="https://colingorrie.substack.com/p/the-lost-letters-of-the-english-alphabet" rel="">stingy printers</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-invention-that-ruined-english" rel="">late medieval yuppies</a><span>. But I’ve not yet plumbed the depths of this complexity. To do so, I will need to tell you the story of </span><strong>yogh</strong><span>,</span><span> an obscure medieval letter whose rise and fall allows us to peer into this abyss.</span></p><p>But like an Icelandic family saga, we begin not with the story of yogh, but with the story of its parent. So allow me to introduce you to the letter ‘g,’ which, as you’ll soon see, is a complicated letter in its own right, dating back to Old English.</p><p>It starts with the shape of the letter. When modern editors print Old English today, they print nice, modern-looking ‘g’s — that is, the ones we use today, with an open or closed loop on the bottom, depending on the typeface.</p><p><span>This modern form of ‘g’ is called the </span><strong>Carolingian</strong><span> </span><strong>‘g.’</strong><span> It had its origin in the Carolingian minuscule, the script used by the scribes of the Carolingian Renaissance, the great revival of learning which flourished in the vast realm of Charlemagne (reigned 768–814).</span></p><p><span>But Old English scribes didn’t write their </span><em>g</em><span>-sounds with a Carolingian ‘g.’ The Old English letter ‘g’ was written in a form called the </span><strong>insular</strong><span> </span><strong>‘g.’</strong><span> Here’s what it looked like: ‘ᵹ.’ It’s like a mix between a ‘z’ and a ‘3.’</span></p><p><span>Let’s see it in action. When the first lines of </span><em>Beowulf</em><span> are written in a modern edition, they look like this:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Hwæt, we Gardena in geardagum</span></em></p><p>‘How we have heard of the glory of the kings of the spear-Danes in days of old’ </p><p><span>(</span><em>Beowulf </em><span>1–2)</span></p></blockquote><p>But in the manuscript, they’re written like this:</p><blockquote><p><em><span>HǷÆT ǷE GARDE</span></em></p><p><em>London, British Library, Cotton MS Vitellius A XV, f. 132r.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now, there’s clearly lots of other weird stuff going on in the manuscript, but focus on how the ‘g’ is represented. While the majuscule (capital) ‘G’ in ‘gardena’ is spelled more like a modern ‘g,’ all the others are insular ‘ᵹ.’</p><p><span>Interestingly, the Anglo-Saxons </span><em>did</em><span> use the Carolingian ‘g’ — just not for Old English. They used it when writing Latin, at least after the late 10th century. This was when the Church in England underwent a set of reforms, which caused a flowering of literature both in Latin and Old English.</span><span> As part of these reforms, the Carolingian minuscule script was adopted for Latin texts.</span></p><p>So for a period, both ‘g’ and ‘ᵹ’ were used in England, but generally speaking, each was used for writing the ‘g’ sound in a different language. Simple enough, but the stage was set for things to get a lot more complicated. </p><p>But for that, we need the help of the Normans.</p><p><em><span>You&#39;re reading </span><strong>The Dead Language Society</strong><span>.

In this year, William, Duke of Normandy, invaded and took the English throne, bringing with him Norman knights, and more importantly for our purposes, </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/why-english-doesnt-use-accents" rel="">Norman scribes</a><span>.</span></p><p>These Norman scribes inherited the writing traditions that the Carolingian renaissance had given birth to. This meant the latest, greatest, 11th-century French versions of the Carolingian minuscule. </p><p>These weren’t so different from the way Anglo-Saxon scribes had written Latin. But they were very different from the way they had written Old English, especially in the ‘g’ department.</p><p>But that wasn’t so much of an issue, since these Norman-trained scribes, and those of the generations that came after them, didn’t write much English at all. In fact, writing in English of any kind was very scarce up until the end of the 12th century.</p><p>Over the course of that tumultuous — and, for English, silent — century, the language had changed a great deal. All the scribes trained in the old, Anglo-Saxon traditions were long dead, so when a new generation of scribes turned their attention once again to English, they had to devise some new strategies for writing it.</p><p>And this, after a surprisingly long delay, is where we first meet the star of today’s issue: ‘ȝ,’ also known as yogh. </p><p><span>Yogh is descended from a variant form of the old insular ‘ᵹ.’ But, while the insular ‘ᵹ’ was thought of as the same letter as the Carolingian ‘g’ in Anglo-Saxon times, the yogh ‘ȝ’ of the 12th century was an </span><em>entirely different letter</em><span> from the Carolingian-derived ‘g.’</span></p><p><span>And, stranger still, ‘ȝ’ was used to write two completely different sounds in Middle English, the form of English spoken from around 1100–1450: the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound as in </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>oung </span></em><span>or </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>esterday</span></em><span>, and another sound that English has lost altogether.</span></p><p><span>The other sound that ‘ȝ’ once spelled is the “harsh” or “guttural” sound made in the back of the mouth, which you hear in Scots </span><em><span>lo</span><strong>ch</strong></em><strong> </strong><span>or German </span><em><span>Ba</span><strong>ch</strong></em><span>.</span><span> This sound is actually the reason for the most famous bit of English spelling chaos: the sometimes-silent, sometimes-not sequence ‘gh’ that you see in </span><em><span>lau</span><strong>gh</strong></em><span>, </span><em><span>cou</span><strong>gh</strong></em><strong>,</strong><em><span> ni</span><strong>gh</strong><span>t</span></em><span>, and </span><em><span>dau</span><strong>gh</strong><span>ter</span></em><span>.

So perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us that we too have a very yogh-like situation with two of our letters: ‘c’ and — wait for it — ‘g.’</p><p><span>Each of these regularly represents two not particularly similar sounds. The letter ‘c’ sometimes represents a </span><em>k</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>c</strong><span>at</span></em><span>, and sometimes an </span><em>s</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>c</strong><span>ity</span></em><span>. The letter ‘g’ is similar: sometimes it writes a true </span><em>g</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>ood</span></em><span>, but other times, what it represents is a </span><em>j</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>em</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>If these sounds seem similar to you, pay attention to your tongue as you make each one: the </span><em>k</em><span>-sound and the true </span><em>g-</em><span>sound are made with the back of your tongue hitting against your soft palate. The </span><em>s</em><span>-sound and the ‘j’ sound are made in slightly different places, but in both cases, they use the tip of your tongue coming up against (or close to) just behind your upper teeth.</span></p><p><span>Each of our two double-sounding letters, ‘c’ and ‘g,’ has two variants, which are made at completely different ends of the mouth. This is how yogh worked too: it had one variant made at the back of the mouth (the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound) and the other made towards the front (that’s the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound).</span></p><p><span>There’s actually a good linguistic reason why this pattern keeps happening. It’s a sound change called </span><strong>palatalization</strong><span>: this happens when a sound made towards the back of the mouth, like a </span><em>k</em><span>- or </span><em>g</em><span>-sound, gets pulled forward because it’s next to another sound made at the front of the mouth. Often, these front-of-the-mouth sounds are vowels.</span></p><p><span>In Old English, these front-of-the-mouth vowels (</span><strong>front vowels</strong><span> for short) included the ones spelled ‘i’ and ‘e,’ which sounded like the vowels in </span><em><span>b</span><strong>ee</strong><span> </span></em><span>and </span><em><span>b</span><strong>ay</strong></em><span>.</span><span> Sometime in the deep prehistory of the English language, the ‘g’ sound got pulled forward in the mouth to sound like ‘y’ whenever it was next to these front vowels.</span></p><p><span>But when it came time to spell these ‘y’ sounds in the Latin alphabet, they still seemed to the Anglo-Saxon scribes to be versions of ‘g’ sounds. So they spelled them ‘ᵹ’ just like they spelled other ‘g’ sounds. This is why, when you read Old English, you can often replace ‘ᵹ’ (or ‘g’ in modern editions) with ‘y’ and get recognizable Modern English words: </span><em><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>ear</span></em><span> is </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>ear</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>dæ</span><strong>ᵹ</strong></em><span> is </span><em>day</em><span>, </span><em><span>we</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span> </span></em><span>is </span><em><span>wa</span><strong>y</strong></em><span>.</span></p><p>A process like this happened in the ancestor of French too, just slightly differently. Instead of the ‘g’ being pulled forward into a ‘y’ sound before ‘i’ and ‘e,’ it got pulled forward into a ‘j’ sound. </p><p><span>This is why the Modern English ‘g’ represents two sounds, one before the letters ‘i’ and ‘e’, and the other before the other letters. It’s because we took our spelling conventions from how the Norman scribes wrote their language, which was an old form of French.</span></p><p><span>While the Norman scribes, and the later English scribes they trained, were used to the letter ‘g’ writing two different sounds, neither was a </span><em>y</em><span>-sound. They needed another letter for that, and they found one: the old insular ‘ᵹ,’ or rather, its descendant, the yogh ‘ȝ.’</span></p><p><span>So that’s why ‘ȝ’ spelled a ‘y’ sound. To understand why ‘ȝ’ also spelled that vanished ‘gh’ sound, however, we need to go back into the distant history of English, long before it was ever written down. Actually, long before there even </span><em>was</em><span> an English. </span></p><p>Back then, there was just one single language, which would later split into English, Dutch, German, Swedish, and all the other Germanic languages.</p><p><span>In this Proto-Germanic language (as it’s called today), the sound that would become the English </span><em>g</em><span>-sound — which the Anglo-Saxons would later spell ‘ᵹ’ — was not the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound we have today in words like </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>ood</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>ba</span><strong>g</strong></em><span>. That came later.</span></p><p><span>Instead, the Proto-Germanic ancestor of words like </span><em>good</em><span> had a sound very similar to the later Middle English </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound at the start.</span><span> Only later would English harden that </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound into the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound we know today. But this only happened in certain places in the word, especially at the start. At the end of the word, the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound remained. In Old English, both versions were spelled the same: ‘ᵹ.’</span></p><p><span>This means that ‘ᵹ’ actually had </span><strong>three</strong><span> pronunciations in Old English, not two: the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound (next to front vowels), the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound (at the start of words), and the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound (in the middle of words). So when those Norman-trained scribes turned their attention to writing English in the 12th century, they had no problem writing the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound at the start of words with ‘g.’</span></p><p><span>But when they wanted to write the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound, they ran into the same problem they had in writing the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound. They didn’t have a good way to write the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound, which didn’t exist in French at the time, so they pressed yogh into service again.</span></p><p>And that’s why yogh has two sounds, each of which corresponds to a pronunciation of the Old English letter ‘ᵹ’ that the French scribal tradition couldn’t accept writing with ‘g.’</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:971,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:1813179,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/i/172153870?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a><figcaption><em>View of the City of Edinburgh</em><span> (ca. 1822), Alexander Nasmyth</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>When you’re reading Middle English, it can get a bit confusing: Which kind of yogh is which?</p><p><span>Look at this line from </span><em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Þa</span><strong>ȝ</strong><span> </span><strong>ȝ</strong><span>e </span><strong>ȝ</strong><span>ourself be talenttyf, to take hit to yourseluen,</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>In this line, the first yogh makes the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound, while the second and third represent </span><em>y</em><span>-sounds. But you just have to know the words in order to figure that out.</span></p><p><span>As inconvenient as this confusion is for us </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-case-for-middle-english" rel="">modern readers of Middle English</a><span>, that isn’t the reason yogh disappeared from the English language. The fate of yogh was sealed by a conspiracy of factors.</span></p><p><span>One is that yogh was never the only alternative for writing the sounds it wrote. The </span><em>y</em><span>-sound could also be written in the way the French wrote it, that is, ‘i’ or ‘y.’ The latter is the spelling that English ended up using for this sound, hence </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>ourself </span></em><span>instead of </span><em><strong>ȝ</strong><span>ourself</span></em><span>. The </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound could also be written ‘h,’ ‘ȝh,’ or ‘gh.’ The last of these, of course, is what English ended up adopting.</span></p><p><span>But the death blow dealt to yogh was the printing press. The earliest printing press in England was a Flemish import, as were the typefaces. But the yogh letter was unique to English, and like the </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-lost-letters-of-the-english-alphabet" rel="">other letters unique to English</a><span>, it would be expensive to print. And, as we just saw, there were ready alternatives, so yogh disappeared without a trace… from English.</span></p><p><span>In Scotland, on the other hand, it stuck around for longer. Scots used the combination ‘lȝ’ to represent an ‘ly’ sequence like we have in </span><em><span>mi</span><strong>lli</strong><span>on,</span></em><span> and ‘nȝ’ to represent either the ‘ny’ sequence like in </span><em><span>ca</span><strong>ny</strong><span>on,</span></em><span> or an ‘ng’ sound like in </span><em><span>si</span><strong>ng</strong><span>er</span></em><span>. </span></p><p>And Scottish printers were more eager to keep it than English printers were. So they took advantage of the visual similarity between ‘ȝ’ and ‘z’ — most forms of cursive writing in English still write ‘z’ like ‘ȝ’ — to write their yoghs with ‘z’s.</p><p><span>You still see the results of this substitution, ‘lz’ and ‘nz,’ in certain Scottish names. But the ‘z’ has led them to be pronounced in ways that have nothing to do with their traditional forms. So </span><em>Menzies</em><span> and </span><em>Mackenzie</em><span> were meant to spell things that sounded more like </span><em>Mingus</em><span> and </span><em>Mackenyie</em><span>.</span></p><p>And that’s how one single letter of the Middle English alphabet ended up being pronounced like ‘y,’ ‘gh,’ or even eventually like ‘z.’ I warned you it would be complicated. </p><p>But the journey through the history of yogh has allowed us to peer down some interesting side alleys of the history of writing, from Carolingian scribal practices to the compromises of Scottish printers.</p><p>I don’t lament the loss of yogh myself, not nearly as much as I lament the fate of other lost letters. But if the cause of yogh is one ȝou fancy taking up ȝourself, there’s nothing standing in ȝour waȝ (it’s included in many modern fonts), althouȝ I can imagine hiȝer causes to aspire to.</p></div></div></div>
