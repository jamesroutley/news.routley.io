    <h1>Spain cancels Pegasus spyware investigation because Israel is not co-operating</h1>

But despite a prolonged analysis of the four phones, it had not been possible to determine who was behind the attacks, the statement said.</p><p>Spain’s government has blamed it on “an external attack” while the Spanish press has pointed the finger at Morocco, given the diplomatic crisis between the two countries at the time.</p><p>The Guardian and El País <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/13/phone-of-top-catalan-politician-targeted-by-government-grade-spyware" data-link-name="in body link">first reported in June 2020</a> that the speaker of the Catalan regional parliament, Roger Torrent, and at least two other pro-independence supporters had been alerted that they had been targeted in what at the time was called a “possible case of domestic political espionage”. Dozens more cases were later identified in April 2022,<strong> </strong>when researchers at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk school published a report saying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/catalan-leaders-targeted-using-nso-spyware-say-cybersecurity-experts" data-link-name="in body link">the phones of at least 65 Catalan separatists had been targeted using Pegasus</a> after the failed 2017 independence bid.</p><p>NSO has said its spyware is sold to government clients only for the purposes of investigating serious crime and terrorism. It has said it investigates legitimate allegations of abuse.</p><p>The spy chief Paz Esteban told a parliamentary committee in 2022 that 18 Catalan separatists, including the Catalan regional leader, Pere Aragonès, had been spied on with Pegasus software – but always with court approval. She <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/spains-spy-chief-paz-esteban-sacked-after-pegasus-spyware-revelations" data-link-name="in body link">was later sacked</a>.</p></div></div></div>
