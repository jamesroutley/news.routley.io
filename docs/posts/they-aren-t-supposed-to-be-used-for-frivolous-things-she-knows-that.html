<div><p><a href="https://laurenmring.com/emet.html">&#34;(emet)&#34; by Lauren Ring</a> is a speculative novelette involving surveillance technology, a tech worker who&#39;s &#34;not even a cog in a machine, she’s just a drop of oil that helps the cog turn,&#34; and the programming of golems. It &#34;was originally published in the July/August 2021 issue of the Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, edited by Sheree Renée Thomas, and is temporarily available on this page for the purposes of awards consideration.&#34; Ring&#39;s stories on the intersection of tradition and sci-fi futures also include <a href="https://www.iftheresanyoneleft.com/stories/laurenring">&#34;The Best Latkes On the Moon&#34;</a> (<i>&#34;This is how to make latkes when you’ve just turned eleven and it’s the first night of Hanukkah and you are alone on the moon.&#34;</i>) and <a href="https://www.diabolicalplots.com/dp-fiction-75b-three-riddles-and-a-mid-sized-sedan-by-lauren-ring/">“Three Riddles and a Mid-Sized Sedan”</a> (<i>&#34;I teach my daughter to chalk runes around the house, double yellow lines that forbid the cars from crossing.&#34;</i>).</p>
