	<p><small>December 28, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>Like many people who&#39;ve been on the Internet for a long time, I
view email as a critical thing in the overall Internet ecology. But
for a long time I probably would have just waved my hands if you
asked me about why, and talked about its wide usage and practical
applications and so on. I was recently reading j. b. crawford&#39;s
<a href="https://computer.rip/2021-12-26-diy-mail.html">DIY mail</a> (<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/mx5i9x/diy_email">via</a>), in which crawford observes
that email is one of the first real Internet federated systems and also
perhaps one of the last. This sparked a realization about why email is
still such an important thing.</p>

<p><strong>Email is our only reliable communication method between different
organizations</strong>. There are a huge variety of intra-organizational
communication systems, to the point where pretty much every large
enterprise provider seems to have one (Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord,
etc etc). These work fine inside an organization or a closed group
of people, and they can be better than email in various ways (hence
their popularity). But all of them are at best cumbersome when you
want to reach out for inter-organizational communication, to work with
an outsider, and they always will be because they aren&#39;t federated
(especially across service boundaries).</p>

<p>(In this picture, individual people are a degenerate case of
organizations.)</p>

<p>There are some services that aspire to being universal in this way,
such as Facebook with WhatsApp (which is used for for customer
communication by businesses in some areas of the world). But since
they&#39;re all central and non-federated, they all suffer from having
to trust the central service provider or, to put it another way,
they suffer from people not wanting to give any single party that
much power. A world where everyone communicates between organizations
over WhatsApp is a world where Facebook holds a huge amount of power
(and probably gets paid actual money by someone), and plenty of
organizations don&#39;t want that.</p>

<p>As j. b. crawford notes, the prospect for another federated, Internet
wide communication system seem very remote at this point in time, so
email is it. The practical alternative is probably some dystopian
version of the Internet where one of the centralized systems wins out so
everyone has to be on it.</p>

<p>(SMS is a federated system for some portion of the people on the
Internet, but it has various disadvantages. Some of them come about due
to history, but others come about because SMS was monetized from the
start. And like email, SMS messaging has its own spam problems, which
doesn&#39;t encourage people to open it up more.)</p>

<p>I think a corollary of this is that it&#39;s to the advantage of all
of the big centralized systems to keep email alive. If they kill
email, on the one hand it could drive people to their central system,
but on the other hand it might force people to someone else&#39;s central
system, because people will be forced to do something and they
probably won&#39;t join everyone&#39;s system (especially if there&#39;s a cost
associated). As long as there&#39;s no obvious winning central communication
system, all of them have a lot to potentially lose if email dies.</p>

<p>(Each communication system has a good motivation to displace and
kill email within organizations using them, because email is a tacit
competitor. But the dynamics are different for communication outside the
organization.)</p>
