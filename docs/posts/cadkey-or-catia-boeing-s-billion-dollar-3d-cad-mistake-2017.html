				&#34;All problems start with a solution process, that leads to a 
				better process, that leads to a better process and on and on, 
				with each advancement providing a more productive solution. 
				Unless something gets in the way that stops the advancement of 
				this process by putting in a much less productive process based 
				on politics or vested interest. This is a story of how politics 
				and vested interest made a decision that caused Boeing to make a 
				Billion-dollar 3D CAD mistake.&#34;</span></i></p>

		<p>Boeing&#39;s move to MBE, using PMI as the 
		engineering deliverable has put them on a path they may not be able to 
		recover. This idiotic solution is still looking for the problem that 
		caused it. But what is worse, is Boeing has given this costly process, 
		legitimacy in many industries!</p>

		<p>Update 9-13-17</p>
		<p>As I ponder on this article I realize that this 
		decision by Boeing alone delayed the industry at least 12 years from 
		effectively moving 3D CAD to the PC. This caused an untold amount of 
		incompatibility in the 3D CAD industry. This set the path for the dated 
		and complex Pro/e (Creo) design system to become the de facto system, 
		creating more incompatibility. Sadly, this system was adopted by the PLM 
		gurus, who thought they could digitalize a system based on engineering 
		documents causing a huge data management mess.</p>

		<p>Boeing 747 Flight Deck 1986</p>
		<p><span>I already had 4 years of 3D CAD experience on Computervision CADDS 4 
		when I took a contract at Boeing Everett 747 flight deck in 1986. It was 
		a drafting job on the board, which bummed me out, but the Seattle area was my 
		home and it was great to get back. I just had a new son and missed the 
		family. </span> <o:p></o:p></p>

		<em>
		<span>
		The 1980&#39;s - 3D CAD - The Beginning</span></em></a><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p>The group had 3 seats of Catia 2. They mostly provided loft lines for 
		the board draftsman to use for reference. I don’t think the Catia users 
		did any design. Like Computervision CADDS 4, Catia 2 was a 3D wireframe 
		system. The Catia 2 operators were prima donna draftsman. They ran these 
		systems, easily costing well over a $100,000 each, 8 hours a day. Cost 
		effective??<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>On my other contracts we were actually designing on Computervision CADDS 4. Most companies 
		had at least two shifts and a few had 3 to make these systems cost 
		effective. These systems weren’t cheap. You had to buy 
		a minimum of 3 seats for $750,000. It came with a mainframe computer in 
		a tempature controled room, 
		three terminals, a Versatec plotter, 250 meg removable hard drive, 
		backup tape system and a control counsel. <o:p>As I think of this, only 
		those with government contracts had more than 3 seats.</o:p></p>
		<p><span>Most of the companies moved all of their draftsman to CADDS 4. 3D CAD 
		was in the realm of the draftsman in those days because 3D CAD 
		engineering deliverable was still the blueprint. These were not drawings. We 
		designed in 3D and created our engineering documentation from 
		placing instances of the model in different views and detailing them and 
		adding other annotation to the industry drawing standards.</span><span> 
		</span><span>This was Computervision&#39;s claim to fame: CADDS (Computervision 
		Automated Design and Drafting System).</span><span> 
		</span><span>Most 3D CAD users are familiar with this process today. The days 
		of the drawing were gone.<o:p> In truth, this was also Pro/e sales point 
		when released, &#34;Faster Drawings&#34;. The effective use of the 3D models as a pattern didn&#39;t 
		show up for years and the PDF at the turn of the century.</o:p></span></p>

		<span>The Death of the Drawing</span></a></span><i><span><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
		<p>These prints were copied and handled just like vellum or mylar drawings, but more than likely released as microfiche for the larger companies. 
		The only thing different was when a change was necessary it would be 
		done on CADDS 4.<o:p> </o:p></p>
		<p>At Boeing there was no way a contractor was getting close to the Catia 
		2 
		system. I would moan and groan about being on the board. Suddenly a 
		fellow said “There is a PC based 3D CAD system on those two Compaqs in 
		that room”. I already was in the world of PCs. I even had some 
		experience on AutoCAD. It was on my Compaq luggable with a tiny amber 
		monitor. But I was already a 3D CAD mechanical designer and was not 
		interested in a badly designed architectural electronic drafting 
		package.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>So, I headed toward the computers. The product was CADKEY. It was very 
		much like CADDS 4. It had an easy to use GUI, much better than CADDS 4 
		with its “dig” (digitizer) pen, tablet and keyboard input. CADKEY also 
		had a colored monitor which was a $25,000 option on CADDS 4. After 2 
		weeks of lunch hours I talked management letting me take on a project.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>An engineer and I proceeded to design the 747 first observer’s workstation. 
		We got the outer mold loft lines for the station lines we were going to 
		be mounting the station from Catia in IGES.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>IGES worked very well between the products. It is quite surprising that 
		that level of compatibility was programed into the programs at this 
		level of introduction of 3D CAD. Later I had the same success with 
		Computervision CADDS 4.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>The project went incredibly well and management was hugely impressed. 
		They started ordering seats of CADKEY by the dozens. We had a list of 
		those who were waiting anxiously to get the next seats. We had an 
		ongoing list of enhancement requests that we would send to CADKEY that 
		they would implement as soon as they could<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>The word started spreading. Other groups would stop by to coordinate and 
		we would give them a demonstration.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p><span>We would send HP formatted files to the print department. Nope, no 
		plotters in the drafting room. So, we had to wait a couple of days for 
		our prints to be reviewed for errors, maybe a better design and to 
		check. </span> <span> </span><span>CADKEY at that time had 
		no documentation module, but full drafting capabilities in the 2D/3D 
		model mode. We would copy the different views and place them on the same 
		level (which we had 256) and detail them. We would put in a border. We 
		always designed and detailed in full size and request the print shop to 
		scale the print. This offered some very interesting problems.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>I was not sure how Catia 2 worked. But by this time, we had 25 seats of 
		CADKEY and still only 3 seats of Catia, mostly being used for structural 
		frame and OML support delivered to support the CADKEY users.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>I was put in charge of training. It was easy, all were experienced 
		Boeing draftsman, contractors and board engineers that took to CADKEY like fish to water. 
		Soon all the engineering documentation was going out of CADKEY. It was 
		funny, we promoted the users to play games like solitaire to familiarize 
		themselves with this new world of the PC.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p><a href="http://tecnetinc.com/CAD%20Training.html">
		<span>
		All you want to know about 3D CAD training!</span></a><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p>But not all was good. Computers had been expanding in all industry 
		based on the mainframe computer. The computer groups were gaining power. 
		BCS (Boeing Computer Services) power soon surpassed engineering. 
		Mainframes and workstations were in the realm of BCS, but not these 
		newfangled PCs (Personal Computers). BCS soon found that it could not 
		control these PC&#39;s. They were not called Personal for nothing. BCS hated 
		CADKEY. We could load it, configure it, licensed it (dongle), maintain it 
		without any input from BCS, Ah, but Catia 2 was totally under their control. </p>
		<p><span>Boeing could have led the world into PC based 
		3D CAD. </span> </p>
		<p>BCS allowed no programming outside BCS. CADKEY had CADL (CAD Advanced 
		Design Language) like LISP in AutoCAD would allow the user to do simple 
		programming steps. It could also be used to copy and import models into 
		different CADKEY files. BCS wanted to remove this integrated function so 
		no one could program. They were completely out of touch with what was 
		needed and required and quite insane.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p><span>They would walk into the group like the Gestapo ready to punish anyone 
		that would defy them.</span><span>  </span>
		<span>There 
		were many battles that occurred. The Boeing draftsmen are not the most 
		congenial bunch. They knew their stuff and knew when they being fed BS. 
		It became a battle ground. CADKEY was soon hated by BCS and I am sure 
		they swore they would get rid of it.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>There were a couple of us who saw the light and decided to create a 
		business selling CADKEY. We all invested in a $3,000.00 286 computer, 
		who would trust a newfangled 386, CADKEY $3,500.00 and a $2,500.00 19 
		inch monitor. This was a huge investment for a couple of draftsman, 
		$9000.00. These were seasoned Boeing lead draftsmen and one engineer. We 
		saw the productivity increases. It truly was a no brainer. I found out 
		very soon Boeing employees make horrible businessmen. 40 hours was their 
		maximum work week. All had hobbies and getting into a business just 
		didn’t fit their life style. More about this later.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>I was performing well beyond my job title and decided to be paid for it, 
		after all I was a job shopper. They offered me a dollar. My rate: 
		$20.00. I took a $15.00 cut to get home. Well, out went my resume and I got a 
		job with Square D in Lincoln, NE. I will tell you the only thing good 
		about Lincoln was the people, because besides corn fields there is 
		nothing there. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>They had Computervision CADDS 4 monochrome screens. I was already 
		spoiled by a contract at Solar Turbines in San Diego where they 
		converted to colored monitors. I quickly brought 
		out my incredible CADKEY system and showed them how I could easily 
		outperform their CADDS 4 using IGES, this was all 2D/3D wireframe. 
		Remember the Boeing fellows. Well they just didn’t want to be part of 
		the business. So, I started my company TECH-NET and sold Square D three 
		CADKEY systems, I think it was the color monitors that sold them. The 3 
		full systems were only $10,000 more than a single color monitor for CV. But 
		this sale put me in the PC and PC based 3D CAD business.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>In 1988 I came back home to the Seattle area and established TECH-NET. 
		We were a CADKEY Dealer. This was also the beginning of wide use of the 
		PC. We were selling hardware and software like crazy. Networking was not 
		included with the MCDOS software so we had quite an operation going.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Being well experienced with the interoperability between CADKEY and 
		Catia 2 at Boeing I started selling CADKEY to every Boeing supplier. 
		CADKEY was the only effective PC based 3D CAD system on the market. I 
		was not the Boeing CADKEY dealer. If I was things might have been 
		different.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Boeing had 1500 seats of CADKEY in the commercial division. How in the world did 
		they justify replacing them with Catia 2? This was still pre-1990. Catia 
		just moved to IBM Unix workstations. What was the big benefit that 
		was worth approximately $50,000 to $60,000 per seat more? </p>
		<p>To make this move stranger, all Boeing employees 
		had a PC. All communications were now on the PC. Why in the world would 
		they add the complexity of a Unix system?</p>
		<p>All the CADKEY PCs were on the same network providing and receiving the 
		same information. By 1988 CADKEY had an integrated documentation module 
		called the layout mode and 1989 Fastsurf, an intermediate surfacing 
		package, that easily matched Catia 3 at the time. This was also the time 
		Windows was becoming widely accepted. Remember, if many of you can, the 
		PC started with the MS-DOS system. CADKEY ran on DOS and I had to take 
		CADKEY kicking and screaming into the Age of Windows. I remember how we 
		had dual releases for CADKEY 7. Windows or DOS. I was an edlin (edit 
		line) programming king.
		<o:p>  An inside joke for very few people.</o:p></p>
		<p>So, it is 1989, CADKEY and Catia 3 were equally capable. I am just 
		assuming this since I never even looked at Catia 3 user interface or its 
		basic 3D CAD system. Boeing Flight Deck had 45 CADKEY seats and I am 
		sure were all designing and creating prints. They even got rid of one of the Catia 3 stations, I was in close contact with those folks. Made many 
		close friends. I will not even tell you about my going away party. 
		Whew!! I was still supporting many of them with CADKEY even though I was 
		not the dealer.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>I was having monthly user group meetings. We had huge seminars presented 
		by CADKEY. We were flying. Many Boeing engineers, designers and 
		draftsman would be in attendance. The NW was in the 3D CAD world. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>What would make Boeing opt to use Catia 3 over a more productive, cost 
		effective, easily maintained and PC Based 3D CAD system? It was not over 
		night. I was not in the know about the relationship with CADKEY and 
		Boeing. But there was a push for Catia. I really don’t even remember 
		what happened. The standard engineering deliverable was the print. It 
		wasn’t until free form surfacing showed up did the 3D model become of 
		value with PC based 3 axis CNC programs, like Smart CAM, MasterCAM, SurfCAM and 
		others when the IGES model become part of the engineering deliverable.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Let’s just use the 1500 number of CADKEY seats that had to be replaced. 
		I know this was a slow process that moved into the early 1990’s. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>Let’s say a CADKEY station cost Boeing $7,000.00 with the software, PC 
		and 19-inch CRT monitor (perfect station). Like I said before, all Boeing 
		employees had PCs anyway. The CADKEY PC system offered much more than 
		just a 3D CAD system it offered a door to the PC world, word processing, 
		spread sheets, scheduling system software, what we all have now was 
		mostly all there then. Nope, no internet, but Boeing had a great 
		internal networking system.</p>
		<p>Boeing opted to spend, let’s make it cheap, and just charge 10 times the 
		price to $70,000 per seat. But remember these were Unix seats and needed 
		a staff of Unix experts to maintain them. We know they had a minimum 
		staff of PC experts to maintain them. Now they doubled the IT staff 
		required. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Ah, maybe that answers the CADKEY or Catia question. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>Who benefited by this move? Surely not engineering. They were happy with 
		CADKEY and the PC. Remember I was one of them for a couple of years. In 
		fact, I still was doing consulting for Boeing and many of my clients. My 
		CADKEY training classes were full of Boeing draftsman and design 
		engineers.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>The only group that would benefit by this move was BCS (Boeing Computer 
		Services) and, of course, Dassault. Trust me they were in charge and 
		hugely influential. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>So, what did this move cost the company just using the 1500 seats. Don&#39;t 
		forget to include all of the logistics! </p>
		<p>
		$94,500,000.00<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>
		But that was just the beginning of the huge costs of this decision. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		
		<p>PTC – SOLID MODELING<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>I am sorry but I must do an aside here at this time and introduce Pro/e. 
		It plays a huge part later in this drama.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>All of the high-end systems were playing with solids. Mostly Boolean 
		operations. Both Computervision and Catia has some sort of solid model 
		functionality. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>But something showed up in the market place in 1988 that set 3D CAD on a 
		path that would not only increase the cost of engineering for Boeing but 
		the complete industry.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Can you guess?<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>PTC (Parametric Technology Corporation) came out with a solid modeling 
		package called Pro/Engineer. <o:p></o:p></p>

		<i>
		<span>
		31 Years of 3D CAD Incompatibility</span></i></a><i><span><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
		<p>Now, Pro/e was the first, as far as I know, 3D CAD system that had solid 
		modeling designed from the ground up. It was delivered on a Unix 
		workstation that were now available at a high, yet not out of reach, 
		price as compared to Computervision CADDS 4 and Catia 3.</p>
		<p>It was a very convoluted system that used a strangely devised history of 
		features based on child/parent relationships. You could design and all 
		the design steps were available. You could also program features and 
		assemblies and create 
		family of parts based on these programs.<o:p></o:p></p>

		<em>Parametric Modeling Finally Defined</em></a></o:p></o:p></SPAN></o:p></p>
		<p>I have to say it was a miracle. It was very, very clever. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>But while it was very innovative it was incredibly flawed. It had a 
		separate part, assembly and drawing formats. I am sure the thought was 
		to be able to relate parts to each other and create constraints between 
		parts. Change one thing and all affected parts change. Great idea. Of 
		course, none of these fellows were engineering types. I used to laugh as 
		I was explained this concept.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>You have a control cable running down the keel of an airplane and the 
		cable moved and all clearance holes in each frame associated to that cable would also 
		move.</p>
		<p>Was I the only one that ever met Mr. Murphy?<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Of course, it took much more time to design anything. Many engineers had 
		to become programmers. You would design the parts then insert them into 
		the assembly. All parts were associated to the assembly. 100 parts, 100 
		associations to maintain. Hello is Mr. Murphy there? So, of course, PDM 
		became a nightmare. No, no PDM was not (Part Document Management) this 
		became (Product Data Management) hmm who would come up with that term? 
		Ah, enter the InfoTechs, yes, the IT folks now were called in to 
		maintain these associated “Pieces of Data” The simple document control 
		of the past was now in the hands of the IT folks defining PDM systems 
		for the 3D CAD users. Which of course now had to understand data 
		management. Mr. Murphy was having a field day, laughing and thinking how 
		could he make it worse.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Yes, he made it worse!!<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Enter PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) this was an advanced PDM system 
		that was to handle complete projects. Was it designed by engineers, draftsman 
		and document control experts? Oh no, none of those folks had the 
		academic credentials or applicable Infotech knowledge considered necessary to 
		reinvent this new wheel.</p>

		<p>Have I missed something???<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Oh, yes we still had the print to worry about. No, no they were not 
		drawings. But remember Pro/e engineering deliverable was still these 
		associated information documents, still called drawings? It would 
		continue to be so until the turn of the century. Yes, there was .dxf. 
		But it was not truly a standard. No program would import the .dxf 
		correctly, and of course, it would change with ever version of AutoCAD.</p>
		<p>As for using the model for manufacturing, 
		it started with IGES which first were in 3D wireframe, then in a surface format, of course, 
		moving to solids in the mid 1990’s. IGES released a solid model 
		translation but soon was replaced with the new, more robust, STEP<o:p> 
		translator.</o:p></p>
		<p><em>Good God, even lowly CADKEY that was 
		developed by engineers had IGES and STEP. It was just too obvious. But 
		the CADKEY developers were much, much smarter, they actually included 
		the documentation in the same file as the 3D modeled part and assy. </em> <o:p></o:p>

		<em>The Integrated Drawing in 3D CAD</em></a></o:p></SPAN></o:p></p>
		<p>It is a bit confusing, you had to have documentation. CNC was in its 
		infancy at the time of the release of Pro/e. Oh, believe me, I will get into that 
		later.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Ah, the associated separate drawing was a misnomer for sure, since we 
		didn’t draw anything anymore caused huge problems for PDM and PLM. Now 
		you had the 3D modeled part and an associated document to maintain. Hmmm 
		this is even more than a bit confusing. Do you know even today the 3D 
		modeled part doesn’t include the information that there may be an associated drawing? 
		Impossible you say? Bring up your favorite Solidworks part.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>I will not go into the complex operation of Pro/e. It was incredibly 
		unique and there was nothing that could compete. I bet the demos were 
		incredible as compare to what?? Nothing. Computervision and Catia were 
		still struggling with Boolean solids. PTC promised to reduce drawing 
		time of 90% one fellow told me. Of course, designing in Pro/e was and 
		still is torturous. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>The Pro/e salesman could walk in to these large 
		companies, set up the Unix system and give them a demonstration. Can you 
		imagine how much more simple as compared to the huge networked 
		Computervision or Catia systems that were only wireframe at the time? </p>
		<p><em>Pro/e was a Miracle.</em></p>
		<p>Okay, Okay… that is enough about Pro/e for now. I will leave you with 
		one horribly devastating fact. All PLM is based on the Pro/e paradigm of 
		separate parts, assemblies and documentation. Didn’t anyone think of 
		making the CAD system more data friendly??? Nope, none were engineers or 
		draftsman who applied this mess of convoluted processes.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Back to CADKEY and Catia<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>We will now move to 1991 and CADKEY and Catia 3. Life was good, 
		engineering was getting done. A few new things showed up 
		stereolithography (STL) and CNC programming. We were now designing with 
		surfacing to provide both of those technologies with functional 
		formatted data. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>I remember doing a job for Spacelabs. In CADKEY they wanted to get one 
		of these new stereolithography parts made. They gave me a 3D wireframe 
		plastic part with no draft. Designers rarely designed with draft in 
		those days. In 3D wireframe it was difficult. Imagine the spherical 
		shapes (blends or fillets). They wanted me to add the draft, now that we 
		had 3D parts and could surface the model for STL. I told them 55 hours. 
		They said it didn’t take that long to design. I said than you should 
		have designed it with draft. I did the job.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Just a funny aside! A year later I got a similar job. Yes, they came 
		back to me. But this time CADKEY had solids. 15 hours. Yes, solids were 
		much, much more productive.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Solid Modeling shows up on the PC.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p><span>In 1995 solid modeling showed up everywhere. Both Parasolid (UGS) and 
		ACIS solid modeling kernels became available.</span><span> 
		</span><span>Suddenly many PC based 3D CAD programs started popping up,

		The 1990&#39;s - 3D CAD/CAM Moves to the PC!!</span></a><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p>CADKEY had a 3D solid modeling module called FastSolids from the creator 
		of Fastsurf, Robert White, show up. After one seminar, I was getting 
		orders for the beta release. All my customers were ready to move to 
		solid modeling. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>FastSolid was a Boolean system based on ACIS, where you would add or 
		subtract shapes to do your design. This was nothing like the history of 
		Pro/e. While it was totally functional you could not really edit the 
		features. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>I was also looking at many of the other new products coming out. One 
		being Trispectives. It was also an ACIS system that could pass solid 
		models back and forth to FastSolids. But it was a graphic design package 
		with rendering and animation and a unique drag and drop shapes from a 
		catalog. It was incredible combination. We did presentations with 
		transparent shapes, labels and animation that would rival the systems of 
		today.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>The engineering world had changed. Solid modeling was instantly king. Of 
		course, we still used 2D/3D wireframe and surfacing to support it.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Catia 4 was released. It provided solid modeling. It was a Boolean 
		system like CADKEY. The Boeing suppliers were now getting solid model 
		from Boeing still in IGES and then in STEP. Every Boeing supplier moved 
		to CNC. We sold Surfcam at the time. We were right in the midst of the 
		action and transition. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Nothing changed with engineering documentation 
		by adding Solids to the process. Yes, solid modeling increases productivity across the board. They still were creating full prints, now 
		called by the Boeing draftsman the “flat file”, but now included was a 
		usable 3D model. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>All was good!! <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>I remember calling one of the groups at Boeing. I had about 85 active 
		seats still in the commercial division. I called to promote 
		more CADKEY. BCS was not quite as worried about CADKEY since it had all 
		official engineering in Catia. The fellow asked me: “Does it have 
		history based modeling?” I thought why is he asking that. I said “Why 
		would you want history modeling, Boolean is much faster and easier”. He 
		answered “Oh, we have to have history base solid modeling”. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>I was selling CADKEY like crazy. Remember Trispectives? Well, they were 
		bought by a company that sold CoCreate (Now Creo Direct) and they in the midst of creating IronCAD. 
		CoCreate was a Boolean only system like CADKEY and Catia. But IronCAD 
		had history and they added the Boolean operation. But at this time, they 
		moved into direct editing. Ah, the difference please.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Boolean Design<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>This system was based on adding and subtracting shapes. It was based on 
		sketches and had extrude, revolve, sweep and loft commands. You could 
		add fillets. But there was no recognition of these features. You wanted 
		to change a hole you deleted the old one and put in a new one.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Direct Edit<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p><span>Much</span><span>
		like Boolean Design but adds feature recognition. You can recognize 
		and actually edit the hole or blend. Today the direct edit functionality is very 
		powerful. It is much, much more flexible than history based only design. <o:p></o:p>
		</span></p>
		<p>I was shown Solidwork and offered a dealership. I looked at it, chuckled 
		and said “Who would use or buy this piece of crap”. How was I to know that Dassault was ready to buy Solidworks for $310,000,000 in stock. Why 
		would they do such a thing? Solidworks was a horrible Pro/e knock off 
		and only had 6000 seat which most were academic. Oh, yeah, Catia 5 was 
		right around the corner. More on that later.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>It was 1998 I was now selling both CADKEY and IronCAD. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>These were not trivial programs. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>CADKEY was moving right along. They added a parametric or history based 
		module. Called creatively “CADKEY Parametric”. This was the industry’s 
		first true hybrid 3D CAD modeler. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>It had 2D/3D wireframe, full free form surfacing, direct edit solid 
		modeling and now history based parametric solid modeling “ALL IN ONE 
		INTEGRATED PACKAGE”. Remember you could do your parts, assembly and 
		drawings in one file.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>CADKEY became the world’s first fully functional 3D Hybrid modeler. We 
		gave a presentation to Boeing commercial in Everett the Boeing folks 
		were drooling. So, what happened here? I will explain later. Today, that 
		mantle is held by ZW3D.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>IronCAD has a single model environment and the only package with truly 
		integrated history and direct editing. I started selling both packages. 
		IronCAD is the fastest conceptual design program and I was moving a few 
		CADKEY users. But its lack of surfacing limited the sales. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>2000 – Catia 5<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Remember I said that selecting Catia over CADKEY cost Boeing millions of 
		dollars. That did not stop over the next 12 or 13 years. If I didn’t 
		come along and provide CADKEY to all the Boeing suppliers would someone 
		else had? I don’t know. But I was in the middle providing the 
		interoperability with Boeing and their suppliers. Like I said Catia 4 
		was not available to even the large suppliers. If it wasn’t for this 
		CADKEY compatible solution, the use of Catia would have cost much, much 
		more. <o:p>I am sure Boeing was oblivious to this fact. </o:p>
		</p>
		<p>Danger, Will Robinson!!<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>One day I got a call from a Boeing Supplier. He said: “Joe, Boeing is 
		not supplying drawings anymore.” Boeing had moved to Catia 5 without any 
		notice to the supplier. They were now delivering the information in a 
		bizarre inaccessible 3D format. They did not know what to do.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>With Catia 5 now available on the PC many had to buy a seat. Dassault 
		also provided Enovia. An expensive and very convoluted Catia 5 viewer. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>I really am not sure what they were delivering for an engineering 
		deliverable. The PMI (Product Manufacturing Information) was being 
		developed. This is basically a 3D drawing. All of the engineering 
		information was to be included in a single native file in 3D space. You 
		needed a Catia 5 or Enovia seat to view it. <o:p></o:p>

		<em>PMI vs AID (Associated Information Document</em></a></SPAN></o:p></p>

		<p>Back to Pro/e and the separate part, assembly and drawing.</p>
		<p>Well, Catia 5 
		was basically a Pro/e clone. I always wondered why they bought 
		Solidworks and the complete development staff. PMI is nothing more than 
		a poor effort to aid with document control now call PDM (Product Data 
		Management). This was now being pushed by an effort to make the model 
		the engineering authority instead of the documentation. This is called 
		MBE (Model Based Enterprise) using MBD (Model Based Design) using the 
		native PMI as the engineering deliverable. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>The suppliers were up in arms. But Boeing decide that they would move to 
		this system and now Dassault Catia 5 PLM was the basis of their engineering 
		system. The engineering system is the basis of the company operation. 
		This move affected all corporate operations.</p>
		<p>In this decision, I am not sure how it came down, but Boeing decided 
		they did not need the Drafting Group or Document Control Group and now 
		depended on Dassault’s PLM system to manage the complete engineering 
		process. As for the draftsman, 3D CAD really doesn’t have a place for 
		them (more on this later). An engineer can do it all. Now they are, what I call, the 3D CAD 
		engineer. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>How CADKEY could have eliminated the need for PLM, MBE and PMI?<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>CADKEY is a true single model environment. You could easily design your parts, assemblies 
		and sub-assemblies in one file. Also you could do your drawings in the same 
		file.</p>
		<p><em>With the drawing included with the part or 
		assembly: would they have needed to go to a complex convoluted PLM system 
		that tried to use the native system in the form of a PMI to simplify 
		PDM? </em> <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Probably not. We would still be working with a much more manageable 3D 
		model and the associated integrated documentation. It was funny as Catia 5 and this PLM system 
		was being released and they were trying to solve the problem with 
		maintaining the separate print, Adobe released the PDF, easily solving 
		the separate print problem and leaving the engineering documentation in 
		stone delivered outside the native CAD system.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>If Boeing would have chosen CADKEY the following situation would have 
		never occurred. With the support of Boeing, CADKEY could have reached a 
		level of productivity that Boeing does not see today or ever will see in the future.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Catia 4 to Catia 5 Fiasco!<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Now for the life of me, a Boeing trained draftsman, a person that was 
		trained by and worked for the most incredible engineering company on the planet, with the 
		most incredible engineering and manufacturing standards, why would 
		Boeing make this obviously not thought through decision.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Boeing was not alone on this decision. Airbus also made this move, but 
		with no CADKEY option.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>
		<o:p>Why was this decision made in this fashion. It was being made by 
		BCS and the Infotechs that had no ability or applicable knowledge to 
		differentiate between the relative importance&#39;s! Yes, they are still in 
		charge!</o:p></p>
		<p>Catia 4 and Catia 5 could not read the others files.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>The 777 was designed in Catia 3, but now all 
		airplanes were being modified with Catia 4 with the introduction in 
		1994. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>It was incredible. There were no translators provided by Dassault!!!<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Catia 4 was bad enough. It could only 
		import/export IGES and STEP. Wait a minute, Catia 5 could only 
		import/export IGES and STEP! <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>We all heard the story about the electronic cable bundles for the Airbus 
		380 not fitting due to the attempted mixing of the two system. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>I will not go into the cost of this horribly devastating not thought 
		through decision. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Can any of you PC based 3D CAD users imagine this. You would have 
		thought there would have been at least forward compatibility. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>Why in the world would they call it Catia 5. I was not compatible at all 
		with Catia 4. Why not a completely new name. It is like a bunch of 
		amateurs are in charge at Dassault, Boeing, Airbus and any other Catia 4 
		users that fell into this trap.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>
		<o:p>Sadly, this mess is still going on today. <o:p></o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>
		<o:p><em>Update 2-20-19</em></o:p></p>
		<p>
		<o:p><em>Catia 6 was released in 2009 and not adopted by any of the 
		Catia 5 major users. Today, Dassault is pushing the 3DExperience, I 
		cannot imagine the cost involved with this move!</em></o:p></p>
		<p>Back to CADKEY<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>At the turn of the century, the folks at CADKEY decided to duplicate the 
		package in a new programing language. I will not go into that fiasco but 
		what came out of it was KeyCreator. This is now a fully functional hybrid 
		modeler. Sadly, the incredible history based parametric capabilities were never to 
		be included.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>I replaced many of the CADKEY in Boeing with KeyCreator. Due to the 
		bumpy introduction of KeyCreator I had lost quite a few seats of CADKEY. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>But KeyCreator still was the best support system for both Catia 4 and 
		Catia 5. Soon native translators to all of the popular packages started 
		showing up on the PC based products. Both KeyCreator and IronCAD could 
		import Pro/e, Solidwork, Inventor and UG native files. But even better 
		they could import and export native Catia 4 and Catia 5 files.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Again, Joe to the rescue. I convinced the commercial division to buy a 
		seat of KeyCreator to convert Catia 5, Solidworks, Pro/e, UG, Inventor 
		and all of the standard formats to Catia 4. The fellow in charge looked 
		like a one legged man in an ass kicking contest. He was working hours 
		and hours bringing in native files and converting them to Catia 4. Why? 
		Of course, you wouldn’t ask.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Catia 4 could only handle a 34 meg file!!!<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Yes, he would bring in the files, edit them in KeyCreator by reducing 
		the size and save them as Catia 4 files. He was hugely successful.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Next question?? <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Why didn’t every group buy a seat of KeyCreator 
		to do their own translations?<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Boeing had a translation group. Every request took a minimum of two 
		weeks. I showed the group manager directly importing a Solidworks and a Catia 5 
		file into KeyCreator and IronCAD and create a Catia 4 file. <o:p></o:p>

		<p>Again, politics won! This guy had a bit of power and was not going 
		to let it go. Can you imagine how many suppliers Boeing has that use 
		different CAD systems and had to supply 3D models? Galley, seats, 
		instrumentation, electronics, etc. Everything came through this guy. <o:p>
		His complete group would have been eliminated. I think Boeing is still 
		using this process.</o:p></p>
		<p>Cost to Boeing? Unimaginable. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p><em>“I have worked with 
		Boeing and Catia for over 30 years. Dassault is responsible for keeping

		Their lack of interoperability is beyond belief.” </em></p>
		<p><span>
		<span>
		The above was a quote from one of my other articles.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
		<p>
		I continue to work with Boeing suppliers. To this day Boeing is still 
		having problems with communicating with the suppliers.</p>
		<p>
		Back to PMI</p>
		<p>
		In 2007 PMI was becoming a problem. Adobe released a 
		package, Acrobat 3D. I was involved with this package. It would read a Catia 5 file with PMI and let you view the PMI and import the part as a 
		STEP.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>
		It was getting huge support by Boeing. Suddenly Adobe discontinued it. 
		They sold it to another company that is still providing it today. I 
		never understood it. A cheap way to view the PMI. <o:p>Today, you have to 
		search for it, virtually no marketing. After all of these years there has no standards set for 
		this PMI format. How could there be one? They are based on the different 
		CAD systems native 
		file. Just keeping up with the different releases would create chaos.</o:p></p>
		<p>
		<o:p></o:p>
		<span>I can only assume that this would have cut 
		into the control and profits of Dassault. I am sure that they advised 
		Boeing it would not be in their best interest.</span></p>
		<p>
		Boeing now demands that the supplier can read the native Catia file and 
		do a validation of the part to assure it is the same as the part going 
		into the CNC. This is an extremely expensive time consuming convoluted process. But 
		remember the 3D model is now the authority and Catia 5 puts out some of the 
		more corrupt parts in the industry.<o:p></o:p></p>

		<p>You be the judge!</p>

		The Worst to Best 3D CAD Systems Expanded!</span></i></a><i><span><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
		<p>I can tell you after 30 years of selling a variety of 3D CAD systems, and 
		competing against many others, that Catia 5 is the worst CAD system in 
		the world. It is devastating for Boeing, Airbus or any large engineering 
		company that has a large turnover of engineers. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Why, Joe?<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Catia 5 is just one of today’s popular programs that are nothing more 
		than Pro/e (Creo) clones. It is a history based only design package. It 
		is not conducive for effective fast design. Now a smaller company with a 
		stable staff may tolerate a history only based system, a large 
		engineering firm with a high turn over of 3D CAD engineers cannot afford 
		the horrible overhead with this type of system.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>I have many opinions on history and direct edit. I promote IronCAD and 
		ZW3D that have integrated direct editing. While I love history for 
		conceptual design I will sometimes completely blow my history and 
		continue to work with a mixture of history and direct edit.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Very large engineering companies should have robust integrated direct 
		editing available.<o:p> Even better have fully functional integrated 
		hybrid modeling, including 2D/3D wire frame, free form surfacing and 
		history/direct edit solid modeling. </o:p>

		<p>While there are a few features like helical shapes that cannot be

		<p>Now the draftsmen are gone. The engineers are producing minimized PMI.

		</p>
		<p>Dassault&#39;s PLM and Infotech gurus are now

		<p>The Boeing draftsman were worker bees. They kept everything in line.

		<p>Was the move to Catia 5 the cause? Not totally, this is inevitable with 
		any 3D CAD system. CADKEY with the integrated drawings may have put the 
		draftsman in a different light. But PMI sort of took all the emphasis 
		off completely detailing the parts and resulted in short cutting 
		engineering with devastating results.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>
		<o:p><em>Engineering&#39;s only purpose is to make available concise, complete</em></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>The engineers do not have a good design and

		checking procedures. I have been told that Boeing has set up a Produciblity Group to review the released engineering. I don’t know what 
		happens if they find the part cannot be made or there are errors. Yes, I 
		have had more than one supplier tell me they had to tell Boeing a part 
		could not be made.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>I always thought the PMI was created to have only one document. But now 
		I am told Boeing has a minimum of 2 more documents that travel with it. <o:p></o:p>

		<p>All just to replace the simple drawing, which today is not even a

		<p>We move back to creating completely detailed 
		associated information documents (drawings). No, we don’t need 
		to go to the standards of yesteryear, since we now include the 3D model 
		as a comparison. 
		But the second check provided by completely detailing the part quickly 
		exposes errors or a better design. It also provides a much quicker and 
		easier review of the document. The Onshape concept is basically a bucket 
		where you can upload and store any form of documentation including a 
		live 3D view of the model. This truly is the perfect solution. No 
		special software, just an OnShape like cloud based document control 
		program, a web browser and an Apple or PC.<o:p></o:p></p>

		<p>
		<o:p>We move Document Control out of engineering and into a group that

		<p>
		<em>It is</em><o:p><em> Impossible to Use the Native CAD File as the Engineering Deliverable! 
		</em> </o:p></p>
		<p>To use this concept, Boeing can easily continue using Catia 5. Just 
		start doing complete associated information documents (drawings) and converting them to a PDF. Get the 
		engineering deliverable out of native Catia 5 system. Dassault also 
		should work to create a stable 3D model that can guarantee the integrity 
		of the part and can safely be exported as a 
		step and not be corrupt. Having so many different 3D CAD systems 
		available has limited the interoperability. Sadly, the major CAD 
		companies have a vested interest in this not working. If they did we 
		would move to the most cost effective standard solution.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p><em>The 3D model cannot be used as the part 
		authority!</em></p>
		<p>There can be huge problems with the 3D model.

		<p>2. More Cost 
		Effective and Productive Software<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>There are very few programs that have the parts, assemblies and drawings 
		in one file. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Could Boeing move back to one of these systems?<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>The truth is that it would be better than continuing the path they are 
		on with Catia 5. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>Yes, you would still have to work with Catia 4 and Catia 5 parts. But 
		these programs read and write both Catia 4 and 5 native files.</p>
		<p>ZW3D is the solution that would fit this bill. It is history based and 
		would need a very short learning curve. I do have to mention IronCad as 
		a supporting design package. Its level of 3D solid modeling productivity cannot be 
		overlooked.</p>
		<p>
		The Single model environment option<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>This is by far the most productive design environment. You design your 
		assemblies in one file. This is a must for conceptual design, no need 
		for PDM in the design stage. Allows all parts to be in one file until 
		the time for engineering release.<o:p> </o:p>

		<p>The Integrated Drawing<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>This is where the door is closed on the data management problem. Your 
		drawing is part of your part or assembly file. You can do assemblies and 
		release all of your part out of a single file. Think of how that would 
		solve the internal PDM, The uniqueness of the associated information 
		document (drawing) is the only thing blocking complete CAD 
		interoperablity. It would be great if we could develop a standard for the 
		drawings as compared to the 3D model. Being able to export both the model 
		and the drawing in an associated format.</p>

		<p>Integrated Direct Edit Functionality</p>
		<p>Integrated direct edit functionality allows 
		direct editing to be part of the design process offering incredible 
		flexibility. Now need for extensive design intent when starting a part. 
		Functional direct edit opens the option to work with any other CAD 
		systems solid models.</p>
		<p>
																								Hybrid 3D Modeling</p>
		<p>
		This is where all 3D CAD systems are trying to go. Sadly, they have to 
		really be designed as hybrid modelers from the ground up. Clumsy add-on 
		modules will never provide the smooth integrated operation, compared to 
		programs like ZW3D Standard.</p>
		<p>
		ZW3D CATIA 5 Replacement Advantage<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>ZW3D can import the PMI of the Catia 5 file. Then create a document 
		inside the file. It can also import/export Catia 4 and 5 files.

		<p>I am a Boeing trained draftsman with 53 years 
		of experience, and I believe 
		from what I have seen the minimized PMI is not sufficient as a format 
		for engineering documentation.
<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>I still believe a completely detailed AID (drawing) 
		is required. If not for a complete unambiguous description to 
		manufacturing, then a second check by the designer for errors or a 
		better design. A completely defined associated information document 
		(drawing) provided in a PDF format is also good for easy review and 
		checking. The lack of these functions is adding to the cost of 
		engineering in errors and slipped schedules. In my own engineering, when 
		I detail the parts, I always find an error. That is with decades of 
		form, fit and function design and drafting experience.</p>
		<p>
		Conclusion<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>It is time for a disruption not only with Boeing and its relationship 
		with Catia 5 but the complete industries relationship with any of these 
		Pro/e Clones that are stealing our precious engineering time.<o:p> Catia 
		is not the only culprit in this crime.</o:p></p>
		<p>As I said in the beginning we got here step by step as the problem 
		arose. But it is time to reevaluate today’s 3D CAD solutions.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>PTC with Pro/e (Creo) offered a promise of associated parametric design. 
		Sadly, that promise was never established. The efforts to implement it has 
		added hours to the engineering design and delivery process. With PLM, 
		they tried to increase the lost productivity with some very costly 
		Band-Aids. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>Evan Yares describes the problem of parametric 
		design very clearly in this article which is first of a series focused 
		on this problem.</p>
		<p>
		<o:p><a href="https://www.3dcadworld.com/the-problem-is-editing/"><em>
		The failed promise of parametric CAD </em></a></o:p>
		</p>
		<p>It is interesting that the smaller companies are 
		very productive with 3D CAD including TECH-NET. Their engineering 
		deliverable is the model and a detailed drawing in the form of a PDF. I 
		suppose not having an Infotech staff keeps things relatively simple. </p>
		<p>Engineering didn’t need computers. We designed the 747 or 767 without 
		them and in less time than they did the 787. </p>

		<em>3D CAD and the 757</em></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>
		<p>We need to establish a standard, equal to what 
		we had in the past.</p>
		<p>It is time to put engineering back in charge of 
		engineering!</p>
		<p>
		<o:p><span> <o:p>
		<span>I have to 
		tell you all, designing parts and the maintenance of those parts is a 
		very simple process. You design the parts, deliver complete and 
		unambiguous documentation to manufacturing, take delivery of the parts 
		and assemble. Then archive the engineering documentation hopefully never 
		to be seen again.</span></o:p></span></o:p></p>
