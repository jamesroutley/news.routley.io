    <h1>GNU Artanis â€“ A fast web application framework for Scheme</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-org2e47554">
<p>
More seriously, Artanis is written using GNU Guile, one of the best implementations of Scheme language.
</p>

<p>
One day, the folks at GNU were discussing what language they would write the GNU website in - and many chose Python. But I found that strange, because the official extension language of GNU is GNU Guile. And I wondered aloud - why not start a brand new project to provide a web framework written with GNU Guile? To which RMS said, &#34;It&#39;s cool, I like this idea.&#34;
</p>

<p>
But at that time, it was just an idea without a plan.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, a few months later, the Guile community held a hack-potluck to celebrate Guile2 turning two - which is a contest to write a cool program in a few weeks. And so, Artanis was born.
