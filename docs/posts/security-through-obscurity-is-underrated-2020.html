    <h1>Security through obscurity is underrated (2020)</h1>

</p>
<p>üî• This article widely discussed at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24444497">Hackernews</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/ioxux2/security_by_obscurity_is_underrated/">Reddit</a></p>
<p>In the information security field, we have developed lots of thoughts that can‚Äôt be discussed (or rarely discussed):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Never roll your own crypto</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use TLS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security by obscurity is bad</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And goes like this. Most of them are very generally correct. However, I started to think that people are telling those because everyone is telling them. And, most of the people are actually not thinking about exceptional cases. In this post, I will raise my objection against the idea of ‚ÄúSecurity by obscurity is bad‚Äù.</p>
<h2 id="risk-defense-in-depth-and-swiss-cheese">Risk, Defense in Depth and Swiss Cheese</h2>
<p>One of the main goal of defensive security is reducing the risk for the target business. According to the OWASP‚Äôs methodology, the risk of an issue is calculated with the formula below:</p>
<p><code>Risk = Likelihood * Impact</code></p>

<p>According to this formula, a Remote Code Execution issue poses more risk than a Cross Site Scripting one since the RCE causes more impact. This is easy. But what about the likelihood metric. According to the OWASP, likelihood refers that:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>At the highest level, this is a rough measure of how likely this particular vulnerability is to be uncovered and exploited by an attacker
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So, if we can reduce the likelihood, we can reduce the overall risk. That‚Äôs good. It‚Äôs actually very similar to a very common idea called ‚ÄúDefense in Depth‚Äù. It‚Äôs also referred as ‚ÄúSwiss Cheese Model‚Äù</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Swiss_cheese_model.svg" alt="Swiss Cheese"/></p>
<p>According to this model, you need to build your defense mechanisms in a layered model so that even the attackers pass the first one, they will get caught on the others.</p>
<h2 id="security-by-obscurity">Security by Obscurity</h2>
<p>So let‚Äôs talk about security by obscurity. It‚Äôs a bad idea to use it as a single layer of defense. If the attacker passes it, there is nothing else to protect you. But it‚Äôs actually would be good to use it as an ‚Äúadditional‚Äù layer of defense. Because it has a low implementation cost and it usually works well.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs think about a couple of scenarios here:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a server that runs the SSH with it‚Äôs default port <code>22</code> and my credentials are: <code>root:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs almost 100% since the hackers are conducting brute force attacks to the services with common credentials globally.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>22</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, we have eliminated the global brute forcers since we are not using a common username. The likelihood and risk are reduced. However, we still have to deal with targeted attackers. A targeted attacker can guess the username as <code>utku</code> since it‚Äôs my name.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>64323</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we changed the default port number. Does it help? Firstly, we‚Äôve eliminated the global brute forcers again since they scan only the common ports. What about the others? To find this out, I did a small survey on my Twitter to find out people‚Äôs port scan behaviors.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m trying to prove a point for my new article. I need your answers for the question below. (please be honest)</p>‚Äî Utku ≈ûen (@utkusen) <a href="https://twitter.com/utkusen/status/1303021175556145154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>As you can see here, lots of people tend to scan the default/most popular ports only. So, if you switch your port from 22 to 64323, you will eliminate some of them. You will reduce the likelihood and risk.</p>
<p>The same thing goes for software vulnerabilities as well. If a vulnerability found in the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol, everybody will scan for the port 3389 globally. You can reduce your risk just by changing the default port.</p>
<h2 id="other-applications">Other Applications</h2>
<p>Of course, it‚Äôs possible to use the same methodology in other fields other than changing the defaults. For example, the following ideas might be a good idea for some specific cases (not always)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Obfuscating codes:</strong> Of course, it‚Äôs common knowledge. Hackers are people too. If you obfuscate your code well, they will need to spend more time to find issues. They may give up eventually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using random variable names for a web application:</strong> Instead of using clear variable names, you can switch them with random strings. It might help just like the code obfuscation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using Symmetric Encryption in the Database:</strong> When you write data to the database, use a function like <code>encryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. Likewise, when you read data, use a function like <code>decryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. If the attacker can read your backend code, obviously he/she can decrypt your database. But if there is an issue that allows an attacker to read data from the database, but not the backend code (like SQL Injection), the gathered data won‚Äôt be helpful for the attacker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-life-applications">Real Life Applications</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is widely used in physical/real-life security. For example, the president goes from point A to point B with his 30 cars convoy. But he‚Äôs not sitting on his own presidential car so that the attacker won‚Äôt target him easily. He can be in any car and it reduces the risk of an attack.</p>

<p>Camouflaged animals are using security by obscurity as well. Obscurity reduces the likelihood of being killed. Therefore, they gained this ability in the evolutionary process.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is not enough by itself. You should always enforce the best practices. However, if you can reduce the risk with zero cost, you should do that. Obscurity is a good layer of security.</p>
