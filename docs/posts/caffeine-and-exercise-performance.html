    <h1>Caffeine and Exercise Performance</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>Welcome to Grappling Lane #9! </p><p>This weekâ€™s issue is all about caffeine and exercise performance, based on the research provided by the international society of sports nutrition. </p><p>This edition touched on:</p><ul><li><p>Caffeine timing</p></li><li><p>Caffeine side effects</p></li><li><p>Factors that affect how much we feel the effects of caffeine</p></li><li><p>Caffeine for cognitive enhancement</p></li></ul><p><span>If you donâ€™t want to go out tonight, </span><a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-020-00383-4" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">hereâ€™s the full 30-page paper</a><span>.</span></p><p>Letâ€™s go ðŸ‘Š</p><blockquote><p>In the early days (1900s) of modern sport, concoctions of plant-based stimulants, including caffeine and other compounds such as cocaine, strychnine, ether, heroin and nitroglycerin, were developed secretly by trainers, athletes and coaches, in what appears to be evidence for early day ergogenic aids designed to provide a competitive advantage</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>Caffeine improves physical performance in both trained and untrained individuals, especially in the aerobic endurance area. It has consistently been shown to improve endurance by 2-4% across dozens of studies. </p></li><li><p><strong>3-6mg/kg body mass</strong><span> seems to be the sweet spot for optimal performance. An average espresso shot is 64mg of caffeine. Thatâ€™s between 240mg and 480mg of caffeine a day. </span><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20045678" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The FDA recommends</a><span> at most 400mg for a healthy individual. At 9mg/kg, side effects are discussed a lot, without much of the benefits.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Like the previous article on </span><a href="https://grapplinglane.substack.com/p/gl-8-what-a-research-paper-says-about" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">hydration</a><span>, the actual effect one is feeling from caffeine </span><em>(from being hyped up all the way to adverse effects on sleep and anxiety)</em><span> can be associated with the way each individualâ€™s body processes caffeine and how often.</span></p></li></ul><blockquote><p>The authors concluded that inter-individual differences in response to caffeine might be responsible for the lack of overall performance improvement, as 50% of subjects improved while 50% worsened, in the caffeine compared to the placebo trial.</p></blockquote><p>Caffeine absorption from food and beverages does not seem to be dependent on age, gender, genetics or disease, or the consumption of drugs, alcohol or nicotine. However, the rates of caffeine metabolism and breakdown appear to differ between individuals through both environmental and genetic influences.</p><ul><li><p>Caffeine doesnâ€™t have to come in the form of coffee. Energy drinks, pre-workout supplements, chewing gum, energy gels and chews are also valid caffeine sources that have been proven to enhance performance.</p></li><li><p><span>Chewing gum seems to be the fastest way to get caffeinated. </span><em>(as the release of caffeine from chewing can be absorbed via the buccal cavity, which is considered faster because it is better vascularized)</em><span>. Although the absorption is faster, the effect is not stronger. </span><em>(this is only useful for purposes where there is a requirement for rapid and maintained stimulation over a specific period of time)</em></p></li><li><p><span>The impact of temperature and rate of ingestion has been investigated, as people were concerned that cold drinks might pose a danger when chugged compared to hot coffee. </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27100333/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">One study</a><span> concluded that although the rate of consumption, temperature and source might be associated with slight differences, these differences are not significant.</span></p></li><li><p>The caffeine placebo is strong. A lot of people can anecdotally reference how caffeine works for them, and it seems like the perception someone has about the way caffeine affects them has implications for how they actually feel.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>In a study about caffeine done with Navy Seals, sleep deprivation and cognitive-heavy tasks, it was suggested that smaller, successive doses of caffeine are more beneficial than large boluses, for improving focus and vigilance.</p></li></ul><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f8130b-74a2-4605-818a-fed42e044353_1486x910.png" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f8130b-74a2-4605-818a-fed42e044353_1486x910.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f8130b-74a2-4605-818a-fed42e044353_1486x910.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f8130b-74a2-4605-818a-fed42e044353_1486x910.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f8130b-74a2-4605-818a-fed42e044353_1486x910.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f8130b-74a2-4605-818a-fed42e044353_1486x910.png" width="1456" height="892" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/83f8130b-74a2-4605-818a-fed42e044353_1486x910.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:892,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:240436,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f8130b-74a2-4605-818a-fed42e044353_1486x910.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f8130b-74a2-4605-818a-fed42e044353_1486x910.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f8130b-74a2-4605-818a-fed42e044353_1486x910.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f8130b-74a2-4605-818a-fed42e044353_1486x910.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p><span>The most common timing of caffeine supplementation is 60 min before exercise under the form of coffee.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p>The optimal timing of caffeine ingestion may depend on the source of caffeine.
