        <p dir="auto">Hello! Thank you all for the excitement, feedback, and contributions over the past month or so since launch. It&#39;s been incredible to hear from all of you building with Codex CLI and now Codex in ChatGPT<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-e5a4ed7ce5b5dcf40c4e5e878ba816be" id="user-content-fnref-1-e5a4ed7ce5b5dcf40c4e5e878ba816be" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p dir="auto">Special thank you to all the contributors who opened PRs to improve the CLI for everyone. From fixing bugs to adding features, it&#39;s been a lot of fun co-developing this with all of you. We wanted to share an update on a few recurring themes: cross-platform stability, security, performance, and extensibility.</p>
<p dir="auto">We&#39;re continuing to address feedback and fix issues that we hear from the community, while we&#39;ve been working on a rewrite of Codex CLI into Rust. You can try it today by running:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm i -g @openai/codex@native
codex"><pre>npm i -g @openai/codex@native
codex</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you&#39;re a TypeScript developer like me, you&#39;re probably wondering why would we do this. High-level: we want to use the best tool for the job. While Codex CLI ships with a neat terminal UI, which has been easy to whip up and iterate with React-based <code>ink</code> <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-e5a4ed7ce5b5dcf40c4e5e878ba816be" id="user-content-fnref-2-e5a4ed7ce5b5dcf40c4e5e878ba816be" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> - the core of this project is an &#34;agentic&#34; harness, aka calling the model in a loop.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our goal is to make the software pieces as efficient as possible and there were a few areas we wanted to improve:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Zero-dependency Install</strong> — currently Node v22+ is required, which is frustrating or a blocker for some users</li>
<li><strong>Native Security Bindings</strong> — surprise! we already ship a Rust for linux sandboxing since the bindings were available</li>
<li><strong>Optimized Performance</strong> — no runtime garbage collection, resulting in lower memory consumption</li>
<li><strong>Extensible Protocol</strong> — we&#39;ve been working on a &#34;wire protocol&#34; for Codex CLI to allow developers to extend the agent in different languages (including Type/JavaScript, Python, etc) and MCPs (<a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/main/codex-rs#mcp_servers">already supported in Rust</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We&#39;re planning to continue merging bugfixes in the TypeScript implementation, while we get the Rust implementation to experience and feature parity in the coming weeks. We&#39;ll share more updates soon on how TypeScript and other languages like Python will fit in long-term into this project.</p>
<p dir="auto">If working in Rust, contributing to codex-cli, and building new modes of agentic coding is exciting to you - we&#39;re growing our team! Please reach out to us at: <a href="mailto:codex-maintainers@openai.com">codex-maintainers@openai.com</a></p>
<p dir="auto">We&#39;re excited to hear your feedback on the new version of Codex CLI as we work towards making it the default experience in the coming weeks. Happy building!</p>
