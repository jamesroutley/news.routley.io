        <h2><span>👋🏾</span> Hey, I&#39;m <a href="https://vadosware.io">Victor</a>, I built this.</h2>
        <p>I built this so I could make projects tailored to the HackerNews community where people could login semi-anonymously with only their HackerNews username. What&#39;s fun about this setup that of course the mechanism is so simple that you could use this to &#34;log in&#34; (in this case an attestation to ability to modify an account) to <i>all sorts of systems</i>, without permission (IndieHackers, Facebook, etc).</p><p>I&#39;m a yak shaver by trade so if you have any questions feel free to reach out and we can compare shears.</p>
