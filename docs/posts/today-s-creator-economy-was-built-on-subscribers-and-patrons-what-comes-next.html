<h3>Building complementary businesses</h3>
<p>The creator economy empowers individuals to monetize their passions and talents. But there is nothing to say creators ought to limit themselves to just those pursuits. Increasingly, creatives are building peripheral businesses around their core passion—shortcutting retailers and selling directly to their audience.</p>
<p>For Sasha, it’s just about leveraging the audience she already has. She advertises her fantasy-themed clothing on her already thriving TikTok channel. Giving her audience a means to buy directly from her has been a runaway success, netting six figures within its first 100 days. </p>
<p>Such ventures would have been impossible—or impractical—even a decade ago, but a wave of new technology has opened up new opportunities. No-code platforms have empowered non-technical creators to build apps and digital services. Direct-to-consumer eCommerce platforms allow individuals to reach a worldwide audience without a worldwide distribution network. Just as new technology gave birth to the original creator economy, so too are new advancements ushering in a new era.</p>
<p>This trend isn’t unique to traditionally creative disciplines, either. Cornelius Fichtner cut his teeth in software development during the 1980s and ‘90s, later transitioning to project management. After a few years leading teams, he launched <a href="https://www.project-management-podcast.com/">The Project Management Podcast</a>. Fledgling project managers devoured the episodes and flooded Fichtner’s inbox with requests for more direct training. The rookie podcaster knew better than to ignore such opportunities.</p>
<p>“I built several businesses around the podcast, two of which are now self-sustaining well beyond my career as a podcast creator,” he says. One business is a prep course for project management exams. The other is an examination simulator. “It means I don’t rely on my creator income to sustain me.”</p>
<p>This de-risking strategy isn’t solely for up-and-coming creators, either. American YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000">Jimmy Donaldson</a>, who publishes under the name MrBeast, boasts a combined audience of 189 million. His stunt videos have garnered more than 23.8 billion views, making him one of the highest-earning YouTube stars of 2020. And yet, even Donaldson is exploring peripheral opportunities, notably two food ventures: a virtual restaurant called MrBeast Burger and a chocolate brand called MrBeast Bars.</p>
<p>The road from YouTube videos to chocolate bars may seem strange, but it’s really the clearest sign of the times. Finding ways to share your art and yourself across different platforms and mediums isn’t just a rare exception for the most popular creators; it’s the rule.</p>
<h3>More channels, more options</h3>
<p>For as long as there have been creators, there have been calls for diversification. ‘Don’t put all your eggs in the YouTube basket,’ advised marketing experts. ‘The algorithm can take just as easily as it can give.’ ‘Don’t build your only audience on Facebook,’ they said. ‘Organic reach is falling.’ That advice is still valuable, but the contemporary creator economy landscape requires a more nuanced approach than just identical distribution.</p>
<p>Nisha Vora’s long-term plan is to diversify her income streams to reduce her reliance on any one platform. But she knows she can’t copy and paste written recipes to Instagram or YouTube. Instead, she’s tailoring her approach to each platform: long-form videos for YouTube, shorts for Instagram, and charming prose for her cookbook.</p>
<p>For many creators, this is an interesting tradeoff: They can’t simply exist in one place, but they get to enjoy the benefits and community unique to each platform. This also creates an opportunity for businesses and services that want to support the creator economy as a whole. For instance, new platform features like <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product/dropbox-shop-empowers-content-creators-to-turn-their-passions-in0">Dropbox Shop</a> allow creators to easily sell content—from e-books and recipes to prints and workout videos—directly to their customers. With every new strand in the web of a modern creator’s network of platforms, storefronts, and social media accounts, there are ways to make their lives simpler and easier. </p>
<h3>Feeling heard, being seen</h3>
<p>There’s no going back to the creator economy gold rush of the early 2010s. Once-fledgling platforms are now titans of their industry, and an entire generation grew up seeing streamers and creators as the new rock stars. But more importantly, more and more people looked online and saw <i>themselves.</i></p>
<p>The end of the one-size-fits-all era of social media platforms means that being any sort of creator is a balancing act. But it also allows so many more voices to break free from the noise and find their own dedicated fans. You can open Etsy and find antique quilts, ceramic dog bowls, or movie-quality <i>Star Wars</i> costumes—and rave reviews from devoted fans of them all. On Twitch, you’re just as likely to see high-octane shooter games on display as you are to watch a middle-aged couple play <i>Farming Simulator </i>while they chat with fans. In a way that was never true for the early internet and or mainstream entertainment industry, the era of the creator economy is one where passion can find an audience, no matter how niche.</p>
<p>With creators drawing their own maps to the next chapter of this space, the businesses and tech that support them should evolve accordingly. Whatever form those iterations take, there’s a ripe market to meet the ever-evolving needs of the creator economy and help creatives focus on what matters most: creating.<br/>
