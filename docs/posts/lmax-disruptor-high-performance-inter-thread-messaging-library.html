    <h1>LMAX Disruptor – High Performance Inter-Thread Messaging Library</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://www.lmax.com">LMAX</a> aims to be the fastest trading platform in the world.
Clearly, in order to achieve this we needed to do something special to achieve very low-latency and high-throughput with our Java platform.
Performance testing showed that using queues to pass data between stages of the system was introducing latency, so we focused on optimising this area.</p>
<p>The Disruptor is the result of our research and testing.
We found that cache misses at the CPU-level, and locks requiring kernel arbitration are both extremely costly, so we created a framework which has &#34;mechanical sympathy&#34; for the hardware it’s running on, and that’s lock-free.</p>
<p>This is not a specialist solution, it’s not designed to work only for a financial application.
The Disruptor is a general-purpose mechanism for solving a difficult problem in concurrent programming.</p>
<p>It works in a different way to more conventional approaches, so you use it a little differently than you might be used to.
For example, applying the pattern to your system is not as simple as replacing all your queues with the <a href="https://trishagee.com/2011/06/22/dissecting_the_disruptor_whats_so_special_about_a_ring_buffer/">magic ring buffer</a>.
We’ve got:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>a <a href="https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/user-guide/index.html">User Guide</a> to guide you,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a growing number of <a href="https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor/wiki/Blogs-And-Articles">blogs and articles</a> giving an overview of how it works,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the <a href="https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/disruptor.html">technical paper</a> goes into some detail as you’d expect,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the performance tests give examples of how to use the Disruptor.</p>

</ul>

<p>If you prefer real, live people explaining things instead of a dry paper or content-heavy website, there’s always the <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX/">presentation Mike and Martin gave</a> at QCon San Francisco.
If you fancy a natter with the folks involved head over to our <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/lmax-disruptor">Discussion Group</a>.
Martin Thompson will also witter on occasionally about performance in his <a href="https://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/">Mechanical Sympathy blog</a>.
Martin Fowler has also done a great <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html">review</a> of the Disruptor’s application at LMAX.</p>
