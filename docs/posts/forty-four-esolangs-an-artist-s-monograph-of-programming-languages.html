    <h1>Forty-Four Esolangs: an artist&#39;s monograph of programming languages</h1>

<p>I have two pieces of esolang news: one personal, the other about this blog.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262553087/forty-four-esolangs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a collection of my esolang work</a> is now out with MIT Press. A sampling of the languages <a href="https://danieltemkin.com/Esolangs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are posted on my site</a>, but that list leans toward the implemented, which excludes some of the more poetic, less implementable langs. The book, like this blog, celebrates playing at the edges of language and code, with some results far from our physical machines. It was a blast to write and forced me to work through on my whole to-do list of esolang ideas: which still resonated for me, and how they might become fully realized. Do I really want to define a language that entirely escapes the act of articulation? (Yes, of course I do!) <a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-hacker-folk-art-of-esoteric-coding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can read the preface here</a>. There&#39;s more in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/esoteric-programming-languages-daniel-temkin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this piece for IEEE Spectrum</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/LilnuA4fERw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this podcast</a> with Sam Arbesman, author of the brilliant <a href="https://themagicofcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magic of Code</a>.</p>
<p>Also on <a href="https://danieltemkin.com/Esolangs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the book page on my site</a> is a list of upcoming talks; if you&#39;re nearby, come say hi. If you&#39;re not, and have a great local spot for me to come speak, I&#39;d appreciate suggestions. I&#39;ll be working my way up from LA to Vancouver but have some NYC and Chicago stops on the way. In 2026, Iâ€™m working on a European leg and more East Coast US/Canada visits. I&#39;m happy to go further off that path, but I&#39;m planning this all myself and this is my first book, so am happy to accept suggestions.</p>
<p>Second, it&#39;s been quiet here the last few years as I focused on the book. That silence was broken with the excitement of sharing <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/published-for-the-first-time-the-original-intercal72-compiler-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the original, long-lost INTERCAL compiler code</a>, written in SPITBOL and found in Don Woods&#39;s garage. Now that I&#39;m past (most of) the book effort, I&#39;m looking for new material, both for this blog and for other outlets: art blogs like <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/835123/what-is-code-poetry-daniel-holden-chris-kerr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperallergic</a> and tech spaces open to these ideas. I&#39;ll be approaching this slowly, and I have a bit of a backlog, but if you&#39;ve come across any amazing experimental codeworks, this is the time to send it my way: please reach out on the site email or reach out <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dtemkin.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over on Bsky</a>. Thanks all!</p>
