    <h1>Google Cloud Workstations managed development environment is now GA</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div jsname="tx2NYc"><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>The trend of remote work over the last few years motivated the developer community to explore new ways to collaborate, and search for new tools to address the productivity challenges that arise from this lasting change. We’ve heard from our customers that the shift to remote collaboration tools, while necessary, is both technically and culturally challenging, and this distributed way of work also brings new security risks such as data exfiltration. Development teams are asking for tools that are user-friendly while enforcing high security standards.</p><p>Last year at Google Cloud Next, we introduced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/workstations">Cloud Workstations</a> in Public Preview, a key part of the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/software-supply-chain-security">Software Delivery Shield</a> offering, to help address this challenge. Today, we are thrilled to announce the general availability of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/workstations">Cloud Workstations</a> with a list of new enhanced features, providing fully managed integrated development environments (IDEs) on Google Cloud. Cloud Workstations enables faster developer onboarding and increased developer productivity while helping support your compliance requirements with an enhanced security posture. You can start using it today by visiting the Google Cloud <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/workstations/">console</a>.</p></span></section><section><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/1_Cloud_Workstations.max-2000x2000.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/1_Cloud_Workstations.max-2000x2000.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/1_Cloud_Workstations.max-2000x2000.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/1_Cloud_Workstations.max-2000x2000.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure></section></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Cloud Workstations addresses the varied needs of enterprise technology teams. <b>Developers</b> can access powerful, secure and customizable development environments from anywhere, using a  browser, local IDE, or terminal, with support for many popular tools and libraries. <b>Administrators</b> and <b>platform teams</b> can easily provision, scale, manage and secure development environments for their development teams, helping automate everyday tasks and enabling greater efficiency and security. </p><p>Cloud Workstations enables you to achieve:</p><ul><li><p>Faster <b>developer onboarding</b>, increased productivity and collaboration with pre configured environments </p></li><li><p>Consistent development environments <b>customized to your teams’ needs</b></p></li><li><p>A level of confidence that teams are using <b>security-hardened systems</b> following organizational policies</p></li></ul><h3>Faster developer onboarding and increased productivity</h3><p>Getting developers started on a new project can take days or weeks, with much of that time spent setting up the development environment. The traditional model of local set-up may also lead to configuration drift, resulting in “works on my machine” issues that erode developer productivity.</p><p>To address this, Cloud Workstations provides a managed solution for creating and managing development environments, where administrators can set up one or more workstation configurations, defining a template for their team’s environments. Updating or patching hundreds of thousands of development environments is as simple as updating their workstation configuration and letting Cloud Workstations handle the updates.</p><p>Developers can then create workstations on-demand by simply selecting among the configurations to which they were granted access. This makes it easy to ensure consistency among environments, giving developers the confidence they’re using the right version of tools and libraries.<br/></p><h3>Consistent development environments optimized to your team&#39;s needs</h3><p>Developers use a variety of tools and processes optimized to their needs. We designed Cloud Workstations to be flexible when it comes to tool choice, enabling developers to use the tools they’re the most productive with, while enjoying the benefits of remote development. Here are some of the new capabilities introduced to enable this flexibility:</p><ul><li><b>Posit Workbench with RStudio Pro support (Preview)</b>: Many professional R users and data science teams using R and Python prefer Posit Workbench as their data analysis and integrated development experience. To better serve this community, we partnered with Posit to support Posit Workbench (with RStudio Pro) in Cloud Workstations, with support for users to bring their own existing licenses.</li></ul></span></section><section><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/2_Cloud_Workstations.max-2000x2000.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/2_Cloud_Workstations.max-2000x2000.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/2_Cloud_Workstations.max-2000x2000.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/2_Cloud_Workstations.max-2000x2000.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure></section></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>This continues the expansion of the Cloud Workstations catalog of 10+ supported IDEs.</p></span></section><section><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/3_Cloud_Workstations.max-1200x1200.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/3_Cloud_Workstations.max-1200x1200.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/3_Cloud_Workstations.max-1200x1200.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/3_Cloud_Workstations.max-1200x1200.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure></section></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><ul><li><p><b>Hardware acceleration with GPU support (Preview)</b>: To allow developers to accelerate machine learning and data processing tasks, Cloud Workstations now supports GPU platforms, including NVIDIA A100, T4, V100, P100 and P4.</p></li><li><p><b>Extended regional support</b>: For improved support of developers across the globe, we’ve added Cloud Workstations support for the following regions: asia-south1 (India), asia-northeast1 (Japan), europe-west6 (Switzerland), europe-west9 (France) and us-east4 (North Virginia, North America).</p></li></ul><h3>Confidence that teams are using security-hardened systems following organizational policies</h3><p>With Cloud Workstations, you can extend similar security policies and mechanisms you use for your cloud-based production services to your developer workstations.
