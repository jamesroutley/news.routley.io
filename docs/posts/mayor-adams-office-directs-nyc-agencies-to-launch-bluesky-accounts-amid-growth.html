    <h1>Mayor Adams&#39; office directs NYC agencies to launch Bluesky accounts amid growth</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Mayor Adams’ office ordered all city government agencies Thursday to set up accounts on <a href="https://bsky.app/">BlueSky</a>, a social media platform that has seen a marked uptick in new users since President-elect Donald Trump’s election.</p><p>BlueSky’s growth comes <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/celebrities-leaving-x-elon-curtis-midler-lemon-trump-election-win-twitter-1985578">amid an exodus from X, formerly known as Twitter,</a> amid concerns over far-right rhetoric and misinformation being amplified on that platform under billionaire Elon Musk’s ownership. Among those who have <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/11/13/prominent-x-accounts-including-the-guardian-and-don-lemon-are-leaving-elon-musks-site-heres-why/">left X in recent days</a> are The Guardian newspaper, Don Lemon and Jamie Lee Curtis.</p><p>But Adams’ office didn’t make any reference to there being a political reason behind Thursday’s move, and the city isn’t walking away from X at this time.</p><p>The main purpose of the move for now is to “limit the amount of parody/misinformation” that could arise from people setting up spoof BlueSky accounts in the names of city agencies, Adams’ office wrote in a government-wide email, a copy of which was obtained by the Daily News. Adams’ office said in the message that agencies should set up their BlueSky accounts “as soon as possible,” but not start posting on them yet.</p><p>“We’re working out some logistical questions … before we begin using the platform,” read the email.</p><p>“We’ll be back with more information,” the message added. “We’re figuring it out in real time.”</p><p>A city government social media staffer, who spoke on condition his name and agency not be identified, said Thursday’s announcement came after a number of municipal employees had complained internally about staying on X in the wake of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/president-results">Trump’s election</a>.</p><p>Liz Garcia, a spokeswoman for Adams, confirmed late Thursday that several agencies have recently expressed interest to the mayor’s office about using BlueSky, prompting the new directive.</p><p>She said the mayor’s office hasn’t received any formal complaints from municipal employees concerned about staying on X, though, and that there are no plans for the city government to abandon that platform altogether. Garcia also said agencies are expected to continue posting on X alongside launching BlueSky accounts that they can “potentially utilize” to reach “New Yorkers like we do on other social media apps.”</p><figure id="attachment_7992971"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2179459042.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1" alt="SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk speaks during a town hall for Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump at the The Greater Philadelphia Expo Center &amp; Fairgrounds on October 18, 2024 in Oaks, Pennsylvania.
