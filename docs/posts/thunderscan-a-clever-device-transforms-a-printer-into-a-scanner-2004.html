    <h1>Thunderscan: A clever device transforms a printer into a scanner (2004)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The first project that I worked on for Apple after starting in August 1979 was writing low level software for the Silentype printer <span>(see <a href="https://x.st/reverse-twins/What_Hath_Woz_Wrought.html"><span>What Hath Woz Wrought</span></a>)</span>, a cute, inexpensive thermal printer for the Apple II, that was based on technology licensed from a local company named Trendcom.  In typical Apple fashion, we improved on Trendcom&#39;s design by replacing their relatively expensive controller board with a much simpler one that relied on the microprocessor in the Apple II to do most of the dirty work.</p></div></div>
