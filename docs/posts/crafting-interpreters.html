<p><em>Crafting Interpreters</em> contains everything you need to implement a
full-featured, efficient scripting language. You’ll learn both high-level
concepts around parsing and semantics and gritty details like bytecode
representation and garbage collection. Your brain will light up with new ideas,
and your hands will get dirty and calloused. It’s a blast.</p>

<p>Starting from <code>main()</code>, you build a language that features rich
syntax, dynamic typing, garbage collection, lexical scope, first-class
functions, closures, classes, and inheritance. All packed into a few thousand
lines of clean, fast code that you thoroughly understand because you write each
one yourself.</p>

<p>The book is available in four delectable formats:</p>
