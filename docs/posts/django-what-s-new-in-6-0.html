    <h1>Django: what’s new in 6.0</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><time datetime="2025-12-03">2025-12-03</time><img alt="Django 6.0: codename “mosaic”" title="Django 6.0: codename “mosaic”" src="https://blog.veitheller.de/tech/assets/2025-12-03-django-mosaic.webp"/><p>Django 6.0 was <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/dec/03/django-60-released/">released today</a>, starting another release cycle for the loved and long-lived Python web framework (now 20 years old!). It comes with a <em>mosaic</em> of new features, contributed to by many, some of which I am happy to have helped with. Below is my pick of highlights from <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/6.0/">the release notes</a>.</p><div id="upgrade-with-help-from-django-upgrade"><h2>Upgrade with help from django-upgrade<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#upgrade-with-help-from-django-upgrade"></a></h2><p>If you’re upgrading a project from Django 5.2 or earlier, please try my tool <a href="https://django-upgrade.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-upgrade</a>. It will automatically update old Django code to use new features, fixing some deprecation warnings for you, including five fixers for Django 6.0. (One day, I’ll propose django-upgrade to become an official Django project, when energy and time permit…)</p></div><div id="template-partials"><h2>Template partials<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#template-partials"></a></h2><p>There are four headline features in Django 6.0, which we’ll cover before other notable changes, starting with this one:</p><blockquote>The Django Template Language now supports <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/language/#template-partials">template partials</a>, making it easier to encapsulate and reuse small named fragments within a template file.</blockquote><p>Partials are sections of a template marked by the new <code>{% partialdef %}</code> and <code>{% endpartialdef %}</code> tags. They can be reused within the same template or rendered in isolation. Let’s look at examples for each use case in turn.</p><div id="reuse-partials-within-the-same-template"><h3>Reuse partials within the same template<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#reuse-partials-within-the-same-template"></a></h3><p>The below template reuses a partial called <code>filter_controls</code> within the same template. It’s defined once at the top of the template, then used twice later on. Using a partial allows the template avoid repetition without pushing the content into a separate include file.</p><div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>section</span> <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>videos</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>{%</span> <span>partialdef</span> <span>filter_controls</span> <span>%}</span>

<span>&lt;/</span><span>section</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>Actually, we can simplify this pattern further, by using the <code>inline</code> option on the <code>partialdef</code> tag, which causes the definition to also render in place:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>section</span> <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>videos</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>{%</span> <span>partialdef</span> <span>filter_controls</span> <span>inline</span> <span>%}</span>

    <span>&lt;/</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>{%</span> <span>endpartialdef</span> <span>%}</span>

        ...
      <span>&lt;/</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/</span><span>section</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>Reach for this pattern any time you find yourself repeating template code within the same template.

It uses the <code>inline</code> option, so when the whole template is rendered, the partial is included.</p><p>The page uses <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>, via my <a href="https://django-htmx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-htmx package</a>, to periodically refresh the view count, through the <code><span>hx-*</span></code> attributes.

</pre></div><p>The relevant code for the two views could look like this:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.shortcuts</span> <span>import</span> <span>render</span>


<span>def</span> <span>video</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>video_id</span><span>):</span>

</pre></div><p>The initial <code>video</code> view renders the full template <code>video.html</code>. The <code>video_view_count</code> view renders just the <code>view_count</code> partial, by appending <code>#view_count</code> to the template name. This syntax is similar to how you’d reference an HTML fragment by its ID in a URL.</p></div><div id="history"><h3>History<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#history"></a></h3><p>htmx was the main motivation for this feature, as promoted by htmx creator Carson Gross in <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/template-fragments/">a cross-framework review post</a>. Using partials definitely helps maintain “Locality of behaviour” within your templates, easing authoring, debugging, and maintenance by avoiding template file sprawl.</p><p>Django’s support for template partials was initially developed by Carlton Gibson in the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-template-partials/">django-template-partials package</a>, which remains available for older Django versions. The integration into Django itself was done in a Google Summer of Code project this year, worked on by student Farhan Ali and mentored by Carlton, in <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36410">Ticket #36410</a>. You can read more about the development process in <a href="https://www.farhana.li/blog/my-gsoc25-journey-django">Farhan’s retrospective blog post</a>. Many thanks to Farhan for authoring, Carlton for mentoring, and Natalia Bidart, Nick Pope, and Sarah Boyce for reviewing!</p></div></div><div id="tasks-framework"><h2>Tasks framework<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#tasks-framework"></a></h2><p>The next headline feature we’re covering:</p><blockquote>Django now includes a built-in Tasks framework for running code outside the HTTP request–response cycle. This enables offloading work, such as sending emails or processing data, to background workers.</blockquote><p>Basically, there’s a new API for defining and enqueuing background tasks—very cool!</p><p>Background tasks are a way of running code outside of the request-response cycle. They’re a common requirement in web applications, used for sending emails, processing images, generating reports, and more.</p><p>Historically, Django has not provided any system for background tasks, and kind of ignored the problem space altogether. Developers have instead relied on third-party packages like <a href="https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/">Celery</a> or <a href="https://django-q2.readthedocs.io/en/master/">Django Q2</a>. While these systems are fine, they can be complex to set up and maintain, and often don’t “go with the grain” of Django.</p><p>The new Tasks framework fills this gap by providing an interface to define background tasks, which task runner packages can then integrate with. This common ground allows third-party Django packages to define tasks in a standard way, assuming you’ll be using a compatible task runner to execute them.</p><p>Define tasks with the new <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/tasks/#django.tasks.task"><code>@task</code></a> decorator:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.tasks</span> <span>import</span> <span>task</span>


<span>@task</span>
<span>def</span> <span>resize_video</span><span>(</span><span>video_id</span><span>):</span> <span>...</span>
</pre></div><p>…and enqueue them for background execution with the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/tasks/#django.tasks.Task.enqueue"><code>Task.enqueue()</code></a> method:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>example.tasks</span> <span>import</span> <span>resize_video</span>


<span>def</span> <span>upload_video</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>):</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>resize_video</span><span>.</span><span>enqueue</span><span>(</span><span>video</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>...</span>
</pre></div><div id="execute-tasks"><h3>Execute tasks<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#execute-tasks"></a></h3><p>At this time, Django does not include a production-ready task backend, only two that are suitable for development and testing:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/tasks/#immediate-execution"><code>ImmediateBackend</code></a> - runs tasks synchronously, blocking until they complete.</li><li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/tasks/#dummy-backend"><code>DummyBackend</code></a> - does nothing when tasks are enqueued, but allows them to be inspected later. Useful for tests, where you can assert that tasks were enqueued without actually running them.</li></ul><p>For production use, you’ll need to use a third-party package that implements one, for which <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-tasks/">django-tasks</a>, the reference implementation, is the primary option. It provides <code>DatabaseBackend</code> for storing tasks in your SQL database, a fine solution for many projects, avoiding extra infrastructure and allowing atomic task enqueuing within database transactions. We may see this backend merged into Django in due course, or at least become an official package, to help make Django “batteries included” for background tasks.</p><p>To use django-tasks’ <code>DatabaseBackend</code> today, first install the package:</p><p><strong>Second,</strong> add these two apps to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>INSTALLED_APPS</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># ...</span>
    <span>&#34;django_tasks&#34;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>&#34;django_tasks.backends.database&#34;</span><span>,</span>
    <span># ...</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre></div><p><strong>Third,</strong> configure <code>DatabaseBackend</code> as your tasks backend in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#tasks">new <code>TASKS</code> setting</a>:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>TASKS</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&#34;default&#34;</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>&#34;BACKEND&#34;</span><span>:</span> <span>&#34;django_tasks.backends.database.DatabaseBackend&#34;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div><p><strong>Fourth,</strong> run migrations to create the necessary database tables:</p><p><strong>Finally,</strong> to run the task worker process, use the package’s <code>db_worker</code> management command:</p><div><pre><span></span>$<span> </span>./manage.py<span> </span>db_worker
Starting<span> </span>worker<span> </span><span>worker_id</span><span>=</span>jWLMLrms3C2NcUODYeatsqCFvd5rK6DM<span> </span><span>queues</span><span>=</span>default
</pre></div><p>This process runs indefinitely, polling for tasks and executing them, logging events as it goes:</p><div><pre><span></span>Task id=10b794ed-9b64-4eed-950c-fcc92cd6784b path=example.tasks.echo state=RUNNING
Hello from test task!
Task id=10b794ed-9b64-4eed-950c-fcc92cd6784b path=example.tasks.echo state=SUCCEEDED
</pre></div><p>You’ll want to run <code>db_worker</code> in production, and also in development if you want to test background task execution.</p></div><div id="history-1"><h3>History<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#history-1"></a></h3><p>It’s been a long path to get the Tasks framework into Django, and I’m super excited to see it finally available in Django 6.0. Jake Howard started on the idea for Wagtail, a Django-powered CMS, back in 2021, as they have a need for common task definitions across their package ecosystem. He upgraded the idea to target Django itself in 2024, when he proposed <a href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/accepted/0014-background-workers.rst">DEP 0014</a>. As a member of the Steering Council at the time, I had the pleasure of helping review and accept the DEP.</p><p>Since then, Jake has been leading the implementation effort, building pieces first in the separate <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-tasks/">django-tasks package</a> before preparing them for inclusion in Django itself. This step was done under <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35859">Ticket #35859</a>, with <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/18627">a pull request</a> that took nearly a year to review and land. Thanks to Jake for his perseverance here, and to all reviewers: Andreas Nüßlein, Dave Gaeddert, Eric Holscher, Jacob Walls, Jake Howard, Kamal Mustafa, @rtr1, @tcely, Oliver Haas, Ran Benita, Raphael Gaschignard, and Sarah Boyce.</p><p>Read more about this feature and story in <a href="https://theorangeone.net/posts/django-dot-tasks-exists/">Jake’s post celebrating when it was merged</a>.</p></div></div><div id="content-security-policy-support"><h2>Content Security Policy support<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#content-security-policy-support"></a></h2><p>Our third headline feature:</p><blockquote>Built-in support for the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/security/#security-csp">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a> standard is now available, making it easier to protect web applications against content injection attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS). CSP allows declaring trusted sources of content by giving browsers strict rules about which scripts, styles, images, or other resources can be loaded.</blockquote><p>I’m really excited about this, because I’m a bit of a security nerd who’s been deploying CSP for client projects for years.</p><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP">CSP</a> is a security standard that can protect your site from cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks. You set a <code><span>content-security-policy</span></code> header to declare which content sources are trusted for your site, and then browsers will block content from other sources. For example, you might declare that only scripts your domain are allowed, so an attacker who manages to inject a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag pointing to evil.com would be thwarted, as the browser would refuse to load it.</p><p>Previously, Django had no built-in support for CSP, and developers had to rely on building their own, or using a third-party package like the very popular <a href="https://django-csp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-csp</a>. But this was a little bit inconvenient, as it meant that other third-party packages couldn’t reliably integrate with CSP, as there was no common API to do so.</p><p>The new CSP support provides all the core features that django-csp did, with a slightly tidier and more Djangoey API. To get started, <strong>first</strong> add <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/middleware/#django.middleware.csp.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware"><code>ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware</code></a> to your <code>MIDDLEWARE</code> setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>MIDDLEWARE</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># ...</span>
    <span>&#34;django.middleware.csp.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware&#34;</span><span>,</span>
    <span># ...</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre></div><p>Place it next to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/middleware/#django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware"><code>SecurityMiddleware</code></a>, as it similarly adds security-related headers to all responses. (You <em>do</em> have <code>SecurityMiddleware</code> enabled, right?)</p><p><strong>Second,</strong> configure your CSP policy using the new settings:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#secure-csp"><code>SECURE_CSP</code></a> to configure the <code><span>content-security-policy</span></code> header, which is your actively enforced policy.</li><li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#secure-csp-report-only"><code>SECURE_CSP_REPORT_ONLY</code></a> to configure the <code><span>content-security-policy-report-only</span></code> header, which sets a non-enforced policy for which browsers report violations to a specified endpoint. This option is useful for testing and monitoring a policy before enforcing it.</li></ul><p>For example, to adopt the nonce-based strict CSP <a href="https://web.dev/articles/strict-csp">recommended by web.dev</a>, you could start with the following setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.utils.csp</span> <span>import</span> <span>CSP</span>

<span>SECURE_CSP_REPORT_ONLY</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&#34;script-src&#34;</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>CSP</span><span>.</span><span>NONCE</span><span>,</span> <span>CSP</span><span>.</span><span>STRICT_DYNAMIC</span><span>],</span>
    <span>&#34;object-src&#34;</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>CSP</span><span>.</span><span>NONE</span><span>],</span>
    <span>&#34;base-uri&#34;</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>CSP</span><span>.</span><span>NONE</span><span>],</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div><p>The <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/csp/#django.utils.csp.CSP"><code>CSP</code></a> enum used above provides constants for CSP directives, to help avoid typos.</p><p>This policy is quite restrictive and will break most existing sites if deployed as-is, because it requires nonces, as covered next. That’s why the example shows starting with the report-only mode header, to help track down places that need fixing before enforcing the policy. You’d later change to setting the <code>SECURE_CSP</code> setting to enforce the policy.</p><p>Anyway, those are the two basic steps to set up the new CSP support!</p><div id="nonce-generation"><h3>Nonce generation<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#nonce-generation"></a></h3><p>A key part of the new feature is that <strong>nonce generation</strong> is now built-in to Django, when using the CSP middleware. Nonces are a security feature in CSP that allow you to mark specific <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags as trusted with a <code>nonce</code> attribute:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>/static/app.js</span> <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>module</span> <span>nonce</span><span>=</span><span>55vsH4w7ATHB85C3MbPr_g</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>The nonce value is randomly generated per-request, and included in the CSP header. An attacker performing content injection couldn’t guess the nonce, so browsers can trust only those tags that include the correct nonce. Because nonce generation is now part of Django, third-party packages can depend on it for their <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags and they’ll continue to work if you adopt CSP with nonces.</p><p>Nonces are the recommended way to use CSP today, avoiding problems with previous allow-list based approaches. That’s why the above recommended policy enables them. To adopt a nonce-based policy, you’ll need to annotate your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags with the nonce value through the following steps.</p><p><strong>First,</strong> add the new <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/api/#django.template.context_processors.csp"><code>csp</code></a> template context processor to your <code>TEMPLATES</code> setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>TEMPLATES</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>&#34;BACKEND&#34;</span><span>:</span> <span>&#34;django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates&#34;</span><span>,</span>
        <span>&#34;OPTIONS&#34;</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>&#34;context_processors&#34;</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
                <span># ...</span>
                <span>&#34;django.template.context_processors.csp&#34;</span><span>,</span>
            <span>],</span>
        <span>},</span>
    <span>},</span>
<span>]</span>

That same year, <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/15727">Django Ticket #15727</a> was opened, proposing adding CSP support to Django. Mozilla created <a href="https://django-csp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-csp</a> from 2010, before the first public availability of CSP, using it on their own Django-powered sites. The first comment on Ticket #15727 pointed to django-csp, and the community basically rolled with it as the de facto solution.</p><p>Over the years, CSP itself evolved, as did django-csp, with <a href="https://rob.cogit8.org/">Rob Hudson</a> ending up as its maintainer. Focusing on the package motivated to finally get CSP into Django itself. He made a draft PR and posted on Ticket #15727 in 2024, which I enjoyed helping review. He iterated on the PR over the next 13 months until it was finally merged for Django 6.0. Thanks to Rob for his heroic dedication here, and to all reviewers: Benjamin Balder Bach, Carlton Gibson, Collin Anderson, David Sanders, David Smith, Florian Apolloner, Harro van der Klauw, Jake Howard, Natalia Bidart, Paolo Melchiorre, Sarah Boyce, and Sébastien Corbin.</p></div></div><div id="email-api-updates"><h2>Email API updates<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#email-api-updates"></a></h2><p>The fourth and final headline feature:</p><blockquote>Email handling in Django now uses Python’s modern email API, introduced in Python 3.6.

This change allows you to use database functions or fields as the delimiter if desired.</p><p>While most Django projects stick to PostgreSQL, having this aggregate available on all backends is a nice improvement for cross-database compatibility, and it means third-party packages can use it without affecting their database support.</p><div id="history-5"><h3>History<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#history-5"></a></h3><p>The PostgreSQL-specific <code>StringAgg</code> was added way back in Django 1.9 (2015) by Andriy Sokolovskiy, in <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24301">Ticket #24301</a>. In <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35444">Ticket #35444</a>, Chris Muthig proposed adding the <code>Aggregate.order_by</code> option, something used by <code>StringAgg</code> to specify the ordering of concatenated elements, and as a side effect this made it possible to generalize <code>StringAgg</code> to all backends.</p><p>Thanks to Chris for proposing and implementing this change, and to all reviewers: Paolo Melchiorre, Sarah Boyce, and Simon Charette.</p></div></div><div id="bigautofield-as-the-default-primary-key-type"><h2><code>BigAutoField</code> as the default primary key type<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#bigautofield-as-the-default-primary-key-type"></a></h2><p>Next up:</p><blockquote><code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code> setting now defaults to <code>BigAutoField</code></blockquote><p>This important change helps lock in scalable larger primary keys.</p><p>Django 3.2 (2021) introduced <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#default-auto-field">the <code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code> setting</a> for changing the default primary key type used in models. Django uses this setting to add a primary key field called <code>id</code> to models that don’t explicitly define a primary key field. For example, if you define a model like this:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Video</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>TextField</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div><p>…then it will have two fields: <code>id</code> and <code>title</code>, where <code>id</code> uses the type defined by <code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code>.</p><p>The setting can also be overridden on a per-app basis by defining <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/applications/#django.apps.AppConfig.default_auto_field"><code>AppConfig.default_auto_field</code></a> in the app’s <code>apps.py</code> file:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.apps</span> <span>import</span> <span>AppConfig</span>


<span>class</span> <span>ChannelConfig</span><span>(</span><span>AppConfig</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>&#34;channel&#34;</span>
    <span>default_auto_field</span> <span>=</span> <span>&#34;django.db.models.BigAutoField&#34;</span>
</pre></div><p>A key motivation for adding the setting was to allow projects to switch from <code>AutoField</code> (a 32-bit integer) to <code>BigAutoField</code> (a 64-bit integer) for primary keys, without needing changes to every model. <code>AutoField</code> can store values up to about 2.1 billion, which sounds large but it becomes easy to hit at scale. <code>BigAutoField</code> can store values up to about 9.2 quintillion, which is “more than enough” for every practical purpose.</p><p>If a model using <code>AutoField</code> hits its maximum value, it can no longer accept new rows, a problem known as <strong>primary key exhaustion</strong>. The table is effectively blocked, requiring an urgent fix to switch the model from <code>AutoField</code> to <code>BigAutoField</code> via a locking database migration on a large table. For a great watch on how Kraken is fixing this problem, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4q0k_FNhw">Tim Bell’s DjangoCon Europe 2025 talk</a>, detailing some clever techniques to proactively migrate large tables with minimal downtime.</p><p>To stop this problem arising for new projects, Django 3.2 made new projects created with <code>startproject</code> set <code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code> to <code>BigAutoField</code>, and new apps created with <code>startapp</code> set their <code>AppConfig.default_auto_field</code> to <code>BigAutoField</code>. It also added a system check to ensure that projects set <code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code> explicitly, to ensure users were aware of the feature and could make an informed choice.</p><p>Now Django 6.0 changes the actual default values of the setting and app config attribute to <code>BigAutoField</code>. Projects using <code>BigAutoField</code> can remove the setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>-DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = &#34;django.db.models.BigAutoField&#34;</span>
</pre></div><p>…and app config attribute:</p><div><pre><span></span>from django.apps import AppConfig

<span> </span>class ChannelConfig(AppConfig):
<span> </span>    name = &#34;channel&#34;
<span>-    default_auto_field = &#34;django.db.models.BigAutoField&#34;</span>
</pre></div><p>The default <code>startproject</code> and <code>startapp</code> templates also no longer set these values. This change reduces the amount of boilerplate in new projects, and the problem of primary key exhaustion can fade into history, becoming something that most Django users no longer need to think about.</p><div id="history-6"><h3>History<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#history-6"></a></h3><p>The addition of <code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code> in Django 3.2 was proposed by Caio Ariede and implemented by Tom Forbes, in <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31007">Ticket #31007</a>. This new change in Django 6.0 was proposed and implemented by ex-Fellow Tim Graham, in <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36564">Ticket #36564</a>.

  <span>{%</span> <span>endfor</span> <span>%}</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>Previously, you’d need to refer to the length in an another way, like <code>{{ geese|length }}</code>, which is a bit less flexible.</p><p>Thanks to Jonathan Ströbele for contributing this idea and implementation in <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36186">Ticket #36186</a>, and to David Smith, Paolo Melchiorre, and Sarah Boyce for reviewing.</p></div><div id="querystring-template-tag-enhancements"><h2><code>querystring</code> template tag enhancements<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#querystring-template-tag-enhancements"></a></h2><p>There are two extensions to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/builtins/#django-template">the <code>querystring</code> template tag</a>, which was added in Django 5.1 to help with building links that modify the current request’s query parameters.</p><ol><li><p>Release note:</p> <blockquote><p>The <code>querystring</code> template tag now consistently prefixes the returned query string with a <code>?</code>, ensuring reliable link generation behavior.</p></blockquote> <p>This small change improves how the tag behaves when an empty mapping of query parameters are provided.

</pre></div> <p>Browsers treat this as a link to the same URL <em>including the query parameters</em>, so it would not clear the query parameters as intended.
