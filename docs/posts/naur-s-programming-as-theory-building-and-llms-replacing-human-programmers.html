    <h1>Naur&#39;s &#34;Programming as Theory Building&#34; and LLMs replacing human programmers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>To understand Naur’s paper, you need to understand what
he means by &#34;theory&#34;, which comes from
philosopher Gilbert Ryle’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Concept_of_Mind">The Concept of Mind</a> (wikipedia.org).</p>
<p>The Wikipedia page I linked above is not a great place to
learn this term and Naur’s use. Instead here’s an analogy by
Ryle in the form of a rather long paragraph from The Concept
of the Mind (Chapter IX The Intellect), starting on page
263:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;If a farmer has made a path, he is able to saunter easily up
and down it.  That is what the path was made for. But the
work of making the path was not a process of sauntering
easily, but one of marking the ground, digging, fetching
loads of gravel, rolling and draining. He dug and rolled
where there was yet no path, so that he might in the end
have a path on which he could
saunter without any more digging or rolling. Similarly a
person who has a theory can, among other things, expound to
himself, or the world, the whole theory or any part of it;
he can, so to speak, saunter in prose from any part to any
other part of it. But the work of building the theory was a
job of making paths where as yet there were none. The point
of the analogy is this. Epistemologists very frequently
describe the labours of building theories in terms
appropriate only to the business of going over or teaching a
theory that one already has; as if, for example, the chains
of propositions which constitute Euclid’s &#39;Elements&#39;
mirrored a parallel succession of theorising moves made by
Euclid in his original labours of making his geometrical
discoveries; as if, that is, what Euclid was equipped to do
when he had his theory, he was already equipped to do when
constructing it. But this is absurd. On the other hand,
epistemologists sometimes tell the opposite story,
describing what Euclid did in delivering his theories when
he had them, as if it was some recrudescence of the original
theorising work. This, too, is absurd. These epistemologists
describe using a path, as if it were a piece of path-making;
the others describe the path-making, as if it were a piece
of path-using.&#34;</p>

</div>
<p>One must not confuse the artifact with the mind that
produced that artifact.</p>
<p>I think something that clouds the whole business is that
LLMs are capable of <em>appearing</em> to have a theory about a
program. From Naur’s paper:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;…​theory is understood as the knowledge a person must have in order not only to do certain things intelligently but also to explain them, to answer queries about them, to argue about them, and so forth.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Indeed LLMs might seem to have this ability, but it’s,
charitably, illusion. The appearance of a thing is not the
thing.  An LLM cannot obtain a Ryleian &#34;theory&#34; because,
well, that’s impossible. LLMs &#34;train&#34; on bodies of work.  By
Ryle’s definition, the text output of theory-making can
never be the theory itself.</p>
<p>Theories are developed by <em>doing the work</em> and LLMs do not
do the work. They ingest the output of work.</p>
<p>Theory building doesn’t work backwards like that. In fact,
that’s Naur’s whole point with this paper:</p>
<p>First, you cannot obtain the &#34;theory&#34; of a large program
without actually working with that program. Reading the
source or even documentation cannot, by some magical
transference, give you the same mind that produced the
program in the first place.</p>
<p>Second, you cannot <em>effectively</em> work on a large program
without a working &#34;theory&#34; of that program.
Naur explains:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;The conclusion seems inescapable that at least with certain kinds of large programs, the continued adaption, modification, and correction of errors in them, is essentially dependent on a certain kind of knowledge possessed by a group of programmers who are closely and continuously connected with them.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Neither machine code nor source code contain the wisdom of
knowing <em>how</em> the program works. Nor does it contain the
wisdom to know <em>why</em> the program was written the way it was
instead of some other way that would have accomplished the
same task.</p>
