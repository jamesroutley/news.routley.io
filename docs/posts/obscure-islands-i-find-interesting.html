<p>Almost done with Open When. The last thing is I want to implement my own backend using Django or something so that I actually know what’s going on in backend (SQL? servers? huh?)! And also how to make it have more local-first principles. We’ll see.</p>

<p>I see other recursers do way cooler stuff than me during batch but I think it’s because they came in with a lot more experience than I did. Or maybe they’re just better than me and that’s fine too lol</p>
