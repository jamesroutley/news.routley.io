    <h1>DJ With Apple Music launches to enable subscribers to mix their own sets</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p dir="ltr">Apple has introduced DJ with Apple Music, which enables <a href="https://www.musicweek.com/digital/read/apple-music-launches-replay-2024-and-reveals-year-end-charts/090980"><span>Apple Music</span></a><span> subscribers to build and mix sets directly from the streaming services catalogue.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The feature is integrated with DJ software and hardware platforms AlphaTheta, Serato and InMusic’s Engine DJ, Denon DJ, Numark, and Rane DJ. It builds on an integration with Algoriddim&#39;s Djay Pro software.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DJs at all levels will have access to Apple Music’s catalogue of more than 100 million songs to create and rehearse their sets on any of these DJ software and hardware platforms </p>
<p dir="ltr">“Apple Music is committed to supporting DJs,” said<a href="https://www.musicweek.com/live/read/apple-music-and-the-warehouse-project-to-release-spatial-audio-dj-sets/090349"> Stephen Campbell, global head of dance, electronic &amp; DJ mixes at Apple Music</a>. “With this latest integration, we’re taking that commitment even further – seamlessly connecting Apple Music with the industry’s leading DJ software and hardware. This innovation brings the full power of Apple Music into the creative workflow, making it easier than ever for DJs to access, play, and discover music in real time.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Users can also access a new dedicated DJ with Apple Music category page, spotlighting a series of DJ-friendly editorial playlists, along with new curator pages for each DJ software and hardware platform that will showcase any mixes or sample playlists that can be used to practice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#34;The integration of Djay with Apple Music across mobile, desktop, and spatial devices opens up a world of creative possibilities for both beginners and seasoned pros,” said Karim Morsy, CEO at Algoriddim. “With instant access to Apple Music’s catalogue of over 100 million songs, <a href="https://www.musicweek.com/digital/read/apple-music-monetises-dj-mixes-for-creators-and-rights-holders/084104">DJs can mix anytime</a>, anywhere – transforming the way they discover and play their favorite music. Whether using Automix for a seamless, hands-free experience or crafting their own unique sets with djay’s powerful mixing tools, this integration marks a major milestone in making DJing more accessible than ever.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“We are thrilled to bring this integration with Apple Music to DJs around the world and in their creative process,&#34; said Yoshinori Kataoka, president and CEO of AlphaTheta. &#34;This marks a significant step forward in making DJing more accessible, and we couldn’t be more excited about the possibilities it opens up.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#34;At inMusic, our goal has always been to empower DJs with innovative tools that enhance creativity and performance,” said Morgan Donoghue, VP marketing, DJ brands at InMusic. “Integrating Apple Music into our Engine DJ platforms marks a major step forward, giving DJs instant access to a vast library of over 100 million tracks and expertly curated playlists to build and refine their sets with ease. This collaboration ensures DJs at every level can seamlessly discover, play, and integrate new music into their creative workflow.&#34;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Teaming up with Apple Music is a milestone moment for Serato’s artist community,” said Young Ly, CEO at Serato. “We are excited to see established and new DJs alike combine their passion and creativity with access to one of the largest streaming catalogues in the world.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">DJ with Apple Music builds upon <a href="https://www.musicweek.com/digital/read/apple-music-expands-live-global-radio-offering-with-three-stations/091020">Apple Music’s DJ Mixes</a>, a programme that launched on the platform in September 2021 with a collection of thousands of sets. </p>
<p dir="ltr">In December, Apple Music also launched Apple Music Club, a live global radio station with curated DJ mixes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Today’s launch aims to expand on that relationship by encouraging DJs to use this integrated experience as a creative tool, allowing them to access and find inspiration in their libraries more easily,” concluded the statement.</p>
