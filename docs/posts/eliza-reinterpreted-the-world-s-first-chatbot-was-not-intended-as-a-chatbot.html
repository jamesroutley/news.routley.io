            <span>Abstract:</span>ELIZA, often considered the world&#39;s first chatbot, was written by Joseph Weizenbaum in the early 1960s. Weizenbaum did not intend to invent the chatbot, but rather to build a platform for research into human-machine conversation and the important cognitive processes of interpretation and misinterpretation. His purpose was obscured by ELIZA&#39;s fame, resulting in large part from the fortuitous timing of it&#39;s creation, and it&#39;s escape into the wild. In this paper I provide a rich historical context for ELIZA&#39;s creation, demonstrating that ELIZA arose from the intersection of some of the central threads in the technical history of AI. I also briefly discuss how ELIZA escaped into the world, and how its accidental escape, along with several coincidental turns of the programming language screws, led both to the misapprehension that ELIZA was intended as a chatbot, and to the loss of the original ELIZA to history for over 50 years.
