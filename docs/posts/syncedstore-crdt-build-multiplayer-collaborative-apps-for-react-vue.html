    <h1>Show HN: SyncedStore CRDT â€“ build multiplayer collaborative apps for React / Vue</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>SyncedStore is a library for building distributed, real-time collaborative web applications that sync automatically. This used to be quite complex, but with SyncedStore it&#39;s as easy as sharing a pie!</p><p>It adds an easy-to-use API on top of modern CRDT technology (see below) to make developing <em>multiplayer</em> (or multi-device) experiences just as simple as developing regular applications.</p><div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>store</span><span>.</span><span>todos</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> completed</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span><span> title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;Get groceries&#34;</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>store</span><span>.</span><span>todos</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>completed</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div><p>Perhaps most importantly, it makes it easy to build <strong>decentralized applications</strong>. This has a lot of security &amp; privacy benefits compared to always relying on central (expensive) servers to keep track of all our data.</p><p>In short, with some technological magic of so-called <a href="https://crdt.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRDTs</a> (<em>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</em>), we can build <em>cross-device</em> apps that are <em>more collaborative</em>, <em>faster</em>, <em>work offline</em> AND put the user <em>back in control of their data</em>.</p><p>SyncedStore builds directly on <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yjs</a> (a proven, high performance CRDT implementation) and <a href="https://www.github.com/yousefed/reactive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reactive</a>. It&#39;s also inspired by and builds upon the amazing work by <a href="https://mobx.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MobX</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nx-js/observer-util" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NX Observe</a>.</p></div>
