<p><strong>Update:</strong> A representative from TD Bank Canada has contacted Finbold to confirm that the TD network “TD did not experience any widespread system outage or issue.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>On February 16, five major Canadian banks went offline, preventing a number of customers from using e-Transfers, online banking, and mobile banking services.</p>
<p>The financial institutions affected by the outage included the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), BMO (Bank of Montreal), Scotiabank, TD Bank Canada, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC).</p>
<p>The number of complaints of people experiencing difficulty accessing their online banking peaked between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, February 16, while accounts of this issue are still occurring on Thursday, February 17, according to a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/canadas-major-banks-go-offline-in-mysterious-hours-long-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> by <em>BleepingComputer</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>“We are currently experiencing technical issues with our online and mobile banking, as well as our phone systems,” an RBC representative <a href="https://twitter.com/RBC/status/1494101316515287043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The RBC team added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our experts are investigating and working to get this fixed as quickly as possible, but we have no ETA to provide at this time. We appreciate your patience.”</p></blockquote>


<p>Notably, customers continued to report problems within half an hour of RBC, declaring that all systems had been restored.</p>

<p>It’s also worth mentioning that the source of the outage has not yet been determined, but its timing is noteworthy since it comes only a few days after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau <a href="https://finbold.com/canadas-trudeau-invokes-emergencies-act-to-include-crypto-transactions/">invoked the Emergencies Act</a> in the wake of continuing ‘<a href="https://finbold.com/canadas-truckers-turn-to-bitcoin-as-gofundme-ceases-9-million-in-donations/">Freedom Convoy’ protests</a>.</p>
<p>Finbold had earlier <a href="https://finbold.com/canadian-police-block-over-30-crypto-wallets-associated-with-the-freedom-convoy-truckers/">reported</a> on February 16 that Canadian police had blocked over 30 <a href="https://finbold.com/guide/crypto-wallets/">crypto wallets</a> associated with the ‘Freedom Convoy’ truckers after issuing an order requiring all FINTRAC-regulated organizations in Canada to stop interacting with the wallets.</p>
<p>Consequently, many are wondering what is going on with the banks as a number of them encounter outages, with some reports claiming that a bank run is taking place, in which large groups of depositors remove their money from banks sparked by fears over the Emergencies Act.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>The new requirements that payment service providers must comply with under the newly invoked Emergencies Act were detailed by Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland on Monday during a news briefing on Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>However, as the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out since banks are currently required to report to FINTRAC, it is unclear how additional laws will induce either planned or unanticipated downtime in the <a href="https://finbold.com/category/finance-news/">financial sector</a>.</p>
