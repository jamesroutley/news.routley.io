    <h1>Ask HN: Promoted, but Career Path Derailed</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Maybe &#34;derailed&#34; is a strong word. But here&#39;s my situation:</p><p>There was a re-org last quarter. My team was working on a specific domain managing a stack. There was another close-by team working in that same domain managing a different stack. They hadn&#39;t been one team from the get-go due to political interpersonal reasons. My director got fired for bad performance, and the other team&#39;s product launch failed (under a different director, both under the same senior director).</p><p>The other team took over my team&#39;s stack and manages both stacks now. The other team had a senior staff engineer, and I (then a staff engineer) was displaced. I was moved to a different domain and promoted to senior staff engineer, onto a team that was historically seen as badly underperforming, and was a huge contributing factor in my director getting fired. I have experience in both domains, but my knowledge, experience, and interest prefer my old domain, in the team I was displaced out of. At first, the senior director didn&#39;t outright tell me I couldn&#39;t stay in the old domain, but made it very clear it was in my best interest to move to the new domain, where there wasn&#39;t a staff+ engineer. I&#39;ve been reassured my performance is great and I feel my work on the last team was appreciated across the org and I established a good reputation, but it&#39;s upsetting that I&#39;m not able to continue to work on my specialty.</p><p>I&#39;ve been feeling lots of things. One is that I really don&#39;t like being in charge of my own destiny with this kind of thing. I&#39;ve left a company due to a bad reorg before largely because I wasn&#39;t in control. I don&#39;t want my career and life to evolve by happenstance. Another is sadness at the loss of prominence in the company, since I have to re-orient myself on this new team, where two experts are already prominent as leaders. Another is just the fact that I don&#39;t enjoy this domain as much and don&#39;t find it as interesting, especially as the work in my previous team is getting into my specialization just this year after I&#39;ve left. Another is that I&#39;m bothered by the lack of continuity in the large projects I had worked on. It pains me to leave so much in a half-finished state.</p><p>A new director is starting in two weeks. I don&#39;t know how much or whether to surface these issues to him. I&#39;m hoping I could start to report directly to him to be able to work on cross-org initiatives, including things related to my other domain, which has certain points of intersection between the domains.</p><p>I&#39;m not willing to leave the company because its stock 6x&#39;ed last year. I&#39;m looking for other options and advice on either what actions to take to change the situation in ways that&#39;ll make me happier and more satisfied at work, or thoughts that&#39;ll help address the feelings about this.</p><p>Thank you.</p></div></div></div>
