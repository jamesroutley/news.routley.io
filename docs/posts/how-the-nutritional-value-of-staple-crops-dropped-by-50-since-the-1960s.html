An important data point comes from this </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/09637486.2021.1981831?needAccess=true" rel="">a recent article</a><span> in the </span><em>International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition</em><span>, written by a team of researchers from Coventry in the United Kingdom. They compared data on the contents of fruits and vegetables measured in three different historical periods: 1925-1939 (published in </span><em>1940</em><span>), 1982-1990 (</span><em>1991</em><span>), and 2011-2015 (</span><em>2019</em><span>). When comparing the same quantities of the same foods over time, they found that the amount of sodium (Na), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and magnesium (Mg) found in them had significantly declined between the first and the last time point. In some cases, a serving of vegetables got you 50% less of these minerals in 2019 than it would have in the 1930s. [Side bar: I had no idea that you needed to consume copper in your food, but apparently </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper#Deficiency" rel="">you do</a><span>.

I’m not talking about any military revolution, but about a scientific one: the so-called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution" rel="">Green Revolution</a><span> in farming. During this period (roughly 1950-1970) scientists like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug" rel="">Norman Borlaug</a><span> cross-bred crops to produce new, high-yielding dwarf varieties of staples like wheat and rice. These dwarf plants had smaller, thicker stems, which enabled them to send more energy to their fruits and carry more weight even in bad weather.</span></p><p><span>Another reason—which surprised me—is climate change. As you may remember from school, plants take carbon dioxide (CO₂) out of the air and, with help from sunlight and water, turn it into carbohydrate molecules (photosynthesis). These carbohydrates make up the bulk of plant tissue. It turns out that today’s higher concentrations of CO₂ in the atmosphere, as well as rising temperatures, </span><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaq1012" rel="">allow plants to ramp up photosynthesis and thereby grow faster</a><span>. Many crops today simply have an easier time growing big than they would have had in the 1960s, thanks to more favorable environmental conditions.</span></p><p><span>Hybrid crops and climate change, together with innovations in fertilizer and agricultural machinery, led to </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78504-x" rel="">much larger agricultural yield</a><span> (weight of harvest per hectare of land) in the second half of the 20th century. This saved the booming world population from starvation, and Green Revolution hero Borlaug rightfully got the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for his work. The growth in yield was quite dramatic, as you can see on this graph from a 2020 paper:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc0b562c-1e2f-4cf5-b676-a82710421ccc_685x380.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc0b562c-1e2f-4cf5-b676-a82710421ccc_685x380.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc0b562c-1e2f-4cf5-b676-a82710421ccc_685x380.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc0b562c-1e2f-4cf5-b676-a82710421ccc_685x380.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc0b562c-1e2f-4cf5-b676-a82710421ccc_685x380.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc0b562c-1e2f-4cf5-b676-a82710421ccc_685x380.png" width="685" height="380" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cc0b562c-1e2f-4cf5-b676-a82710421ccc_685x380.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:380,&#34;width&#34;:685,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;figure 1&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="figure 1" title="figure 1" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc0b562c-1e2f-4cf5-b676-a82710421ccc_685x380.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc0b562c-1e2f-4cf5-b676-a82710421ccc_685x380.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc0b562c-1e2f-4cf5-b676-a82710421ccc_685x380.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc0b562c-1e2f-4cf5-b676-a82710421ccc_685x380.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Trends in wheat yield (tons per hectare) and thousand kernel weight (TKW) of a long-running wheat experiment in the UK.
