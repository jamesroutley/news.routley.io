    <p>	Long live Ian’s Shoelace Site.</p>
    <p>	– Magnus R., Europe, Sep-2023</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>	I just wanted to thank you for your knot (not something I&#39;d ever thought I&#39;d write in an email).</p>
    <p>	Many years back, I was referred to your site from some distant corner of the internet and discovered your “Ian Knot”.
	For the fun of it, I challenged myself to learn this and several other knots, which has been extremely useful more often than I&#39;d have guessed.
	I greatly appreciate the effort you put into not only providing a nice collection of resources, but in making them easy to absorb through diagrams and descriptions.</p>
    <p>	I learned a collection of knots through scouting long ago, but as an avid hiker, the Ian Knot especially has saved time and shoelaces.
	I realized yesterday while teaching knots (including yours) to a group of kids that you may not always see your impact. I&#39;m glad to see that your site it still up,</p>
    <p>	In short, thank you.</p>
    <p>	– Jeremy S., Aug-2023</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>	I hadn&#39;t been on the site for quite awhile but just picked up a new “used” pair of sneakers at our local thrift store; so I wanted to give them some groovy lacing method
	(as I do with every lace up shoes I have, since I found you) and I see the new flip option!! Oh how this will help me.
	I&#39;m one of those who doesn&#39;t know right from left and up from down. So yeah 🎉😁 and Thanks.</p>
    <p>	P.S. because of you, I learned I had been trying my shoes wrong for over 50 years and never wore lace up athletic shoes
	because they constantly come untied and made the tops of my feet go numb...but now I&#39;ve learned so much from your site! Thank you thank you thank you</p>
    <p>	– Krista E., Colorado, USA, Aug-2023</p>

  <div>
    <p>	First, a big thank you for the nice and useful website. Your shoelace instructions are clear and you present so many different lacing techniques.</p>
    <p>	– Stefan, Germany, Jul-2023</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>	I wanted to find out more about lacing shoes, when I chanced upon your web-site.
	I certainly found what I was looking for, and very pleasantly surprised at the wealth of lacing, and laces, information. It was clearly a labour of love.</p>
    <p>	On reading further, I was moved by how long that you&#39;ve been doing this, the breadth of your efforts (including a book!), and the app tale of woe.
	Being a chap of a certain age myself (66), and of European extraction too (Switzerland), your tale resonated with me, and I could certainly sympathise.
	So, of course, I wanted to help,  hence the small donation.</p>
    <p>	– Maurice L., Switzerland, Jul-2023</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>	Your site&#39;s great; I&#39;ve used your Mega Ian Shoelace Knot many times. I also use your site as a reference for other things, such as Over Under Lacing,
	whenever I&#39;m too lazy to remember what the amount of eyelets on a given shoe means in terms of starting the lacing.</p>
    <p>	– Larry C., Jul-2023</p>
