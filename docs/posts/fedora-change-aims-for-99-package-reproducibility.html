    <h1>Fedora change aims for 99% package reproducibility</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The effort to ensure that open-source software is <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">reproducible</a> has been
gathering steam over the years, and gaining traction with major Linux
distributions. Debian, for example, has been <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/985739/">working toward reproducible
builds</a> for more than a decade; it can <a href="https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2025-March/003675.html">now</a>
produce <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleInstalls/LiveImages#Status">official
live CDs</a> of the current stable release that are 
reproducible. Fedora started on the path much later, but it has
progressed far enough that the project is now considering a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Package_builds_are_expected_to_be_reproducible">change
proposal</a> for the Fedora 43 development cycle, expected to be
released in October, with a goal of
making 99% of Fedora&#39;s package builds reproducible. So far, reaction
to the proposal seems favorable and focused primarily on how to
achieve the <span>goal—with</span> minimal pain for <span>packagers—rather</span> than whether to attempt it.</p>

<h4>Defining reproducible builds</h4>

<p>The Reproducible Builds project <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/definition/">defines</a> a
build as reproducible if &#34;<q>given the same source code, build
environment and build instructions, any party can recreate bit-by-bit
identical copies of all specified artifacts</q>&#34;. In a <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/report-from-the-reproducible-builds-hackfest-during-flock-2023/87469">2023
hackfest report</a>, Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek said that Fedora has
not prioritized reproducible builds in the past because Fedora has
more control over its build process than Debian and other
distributions. Because Debian allows maintainers to
generate source packages on their local system and to upload
some locally built packages for distribution to users, he said that &#34;<q>trust
in the contents of both source and binary packages is low</q>.&#34;
(Debian&#39;s build daemons build <em>most</em> binary packages from
source for distribution to users, <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/pkgs.html#source-and-binary-uploads">but
there are exceptions</a>.)
Fedora, on the other hand, exercises much more control over packages.</p>

<blockquote>
In Fedora, all packages that are distributed to users are built in the
centralized, strongly controlled infrastructure. All source rpms are
built from &#34;dist-git&#34;: a git repository which contains the build
&#34;recipe&#34; and a cryptographic hash of package sources, so it is
relatively easy to verify what changed between package versions, what
&#34;inputs&#34; went into a particular source package, and in what
environment the binary packages were built.
</blockquote>

<p>However, even though Fedora has a tighter control over its
packages, <span>Jędrzejewski-Szmek</span> said that
one of the benefits of reproducible builds was to help detect and
mitigate any kind of supply-chain attack on Fedora&#39;s builders and
allow others to perform independent verification that the package
sources match the binaries that are delivered by Fedora. It&#39;s
interesting to note that Fedora had embarked on this work before <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/967866/">the XZ backdoor</a> drew even
more attention to supply-chain attacks.</p>

<p>He acknowledges that Debian is more advanced in its reproducible
builds processes, and notes that Fedora is setting a different 
<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/reproducible-builds/">definition</a>
for reproducible builds. This definition excludes signatures and
some metadata and focuses solely on the payload of packaged files in a given
RPM:</p>

<blockquote>
A build is reproducible if given the same source code, build
environment and build instructions, and metadata from the build
artifacts, any party can recreate copies of the artifacts that are
identical except for the signatures and parts of metadata.
</blockquote>

<p>The reason Fedora is pursuing a different definition of
reproducible build is that it <em><a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/reproducible-builds/#_caveats">cannot</a></em>
achieve &#34;<q>bit-by-bit</q>&#34; reproducibility by the
original definition. This is because of differences in the package
format and the way that Fedora builds its packages. RPMs embed the
package signature in the RPM when they are built, but Debian uses
detached signatures. RPMs also include information, such as the build
time (<tt>BUILDTIME</tt>) and build host (<tt>BUILDHOST</tt>) in the RPM&#39;s
header, that can affect reproducibilty. There was a <a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2603">discussion</a>
about allowing these variables to be overridden. However, the
prevailing opinion was that the information provided by
<tt>BUILDHOST</tt> is useful, and
overriding its inclusion is not desirable. The contents, however,
should still be &#34;<q>bit-by-bit</q>&#34; identical, even though that phrase
does not turn up in Fedora&#39;s definition.</p>

<p>The openSUSE project, which also distributes software using the RPM
format, sets <tt>BUILDHOST</tt> to &#34;<tt>reproducible</tt>&#34;, <a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2603#issuecomment-1713960828">according</a>
to Jan Zerebecki. The actual build host is printed in the build logs,
and interested users can search openSUSE&#39;s build logs to find the
host.</p>

<h4>Path to reproducibility</h4>

<p>For <tt>BUILDTIME</tt>, openSUSE sets the build time to the date of
the latest changelog entry. This is provided to builds by the <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/"><tt>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</tt></a>
environment variable. This is where Fedora&#39;s reproducible builds work
began, with a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/ReproducibleBuildsClampMtimes">change</a>
that was made during the Fedora 38 development cycle to &#34;clamp&#34;
the modification time (mtime) of packaged files to
<tt>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</tt>. This ensured that the mtimes were
independent of the time of an actual build. Packagers were given the
ability to <span>opt-out</span> of this if, for some
reason, their package would be broken by the new behavior. </p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>During the Fedora 41 development cycle, the project
implemented another <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/ReproduciblePackageBuilds">change
in the RPM build process</a> to remove common sources of
irreproducibility. That change made use of a Rust program, <a href="https://github.com/keszybz/add-determinism?tab=readme-ov-file#build-postprocessor-to-reset-metadata-fields-for-build-reproducibility"><tt>add-determinism</tt></a>,
that attempts to standardize metadata in binary or source files to
ensure consistency. It is similar to Debian&#39;s <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism"><tt>strip-nondeterminism</tt></a>,
which is a Perl library that is part of the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/debhelper.7.html"><tt>debhelper</tt></a>
tool for building Debian packages. Using
<tt>strip-nondeterminism</tt>, the <tt>debhelper</tt> tool removes
non-deterministic information such as timestamps and filesystem
ordering from various file and archive formats. The Fedora project
chose to write its own tool because it was undesirable to pull Perl
into the build root for every package.</p>

<p>According to the new change proposal, the modifications to Fedora&#39;s build
infrastructure to date have allowed it to make 90% of package builds
reproducible. The goal now is to reach 99% of package builds. 
It appears that Fedora has gotten as much mileage out of
infrastructure changes, without requiring individual packagers to deal
with reproducibility problems, as it can. To get to 99% the project is going
to have to ask packagers to treat reproducibility problems in their
packages as bugs.</p>

<p>The change <span>owners—Jędrzejewski-Szmek</span>, Davide
Cavalca, and Jelle <span>van der Waa—would</span>
package the <a href="https://github.com/keszybz/fedora-repro-build"><tt>fedora-repro-build</tt></a>
utility to allow developers to make local rebuilds of packages built in <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji">Koji</a> (Fedora&#39;s build
system) to test their reproducibility. It will also require standing up a public instance of <a href="https://github.com/kpcyrd/rebuilderd/?tab=readme-ov-file#rebuilderd1---">rebuilderd</a>, which is a system for providing independent verification that binary
packages can be reproduced from source code. It can scan a package
repository&#39;s metadata for new or updated packages and then queue them
for rebuilding, and it provides an API to query for the reproducibility
status of packages. Rebuilderd can also, optionally, use the <a href="https://diffoscope.org/">diffoscope</a> tool to generate a
report of differences. The <a href="https://reproducible.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux reproducible
status page</a> provides a good example of rebuilderd in use.</p>

<p>If accepted, the proposal would also require an update to Fedora&#39;s <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/">packaging
guidelines</a> that would say packages should (not, at least
currently, &#34;must&#34;) build reproducibly and allow bugs to be filed
against packages when they are not reproducible.</p>

<p>Aside from the security benefits of reproducibility, the proposal
also makes the case that it will lead to packages of higher
quality. Irreproducible bits in packages are quite often &#34;<q>caused by
an error or sloppiness in the code</q>&#34;. For example, dependence on
hardware architecture in architecture-independent (noarch) packages is
&#34;<q>almost always unwanted and/or a bug</q>&#34;, and reproducibility tests
can uncover those bugs.</p>

<p>The proposal acknowledges that some packages will have problems
with reproducibility that cannot be fixed easily. For example, Haskell
packages are not currently reproducible when compiled by more than one
thread, though <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/12935">a fix is
being worked on</a>. Packages produced with Go have <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-reproducible-builds/project/issue/15">debug
data that is not reproducible</a> because the GNU Debugger index file
(<tt>.gdb_index</tt>) can be of varying size even given the same
input. No fix is yet in the works for that. Another known problem is
that the Linux kernel uses an ephemeral key for module signatures. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1012946/">covered</a> a patch set from
Thomas Weißschuh that may solve that problem.</p>

<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>In the discussion thread on Fedora&#39;s Discourse forum, Fedora&#39;s
infrastructure lead Kevin Fenzi <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f43-change-proposal-package-builds-are-expected-to-be-reproducible-system-wide/147320/8">asked</a>,
&#34;<q>where will this [rebuilderd] instance live and who will maintain
it? 🙂</q>&#34; He also noted it would be good to have documentation on
setting up a rebuilderd instance. &#34;<q>Otherwise I like the
idea!</q>&#34; Cavalca <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f43-change-proposal-package-builds-are-expected-to-be-reproducible-system-wide/147320/9">said</a>
that the reproducibility work was currently using an Amazon Web
Services (AWS) account sponsored by Meta, but &#34;<q>we can look at
moving into Fedora infra if there&#39;s a preference for that</q>&#34;. Fenzi
<a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f43-change-proposal-package-builds-are-expected-to-be-reproducible-system-wide/147320/10">replied</a>
that it might be good to keep running the work outside Fedora
infrastructure to make it more independent. &#34;<q>Although of course we could run one and
then others could run others and compare</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>Daniel P. Berrangé <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z9vPRyCDNOunM0yY%40redhat.com/">asked</a>
if rebuilderd could be integrated with Koji so that maintainers did
not have to learn another build tool. &#34;<q>I&#39;m pretty unenthusiastic
about dealing with yet another standalone web service providing
post-build testing.</q>&#34; Jędrzejewski-Szmek <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z9vacXyfaLMAqpbu@kawka3.in.waw.pl/">said</a>
that using Koji to perform the build was an interesting idea, but &#34;<q>we
also want our rebuilds to be as independent as possible</q>&#34;, so it
would still be desirable to do them in a system other than
Koji. Rebuilding a package the second time in the same build
environment means &#34;<q>we are not testing much</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>Miroslav Suchý, a member of Fedora&#39;s infrastructure team, 
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/1f4e42ae-8730-4c12-b9b3-b9ba98ab4979@redhat.com/">wondered</a>
if rebuilderd could submit builds to Fedora&#39;s <a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/">Copr</a> build system
instead of standing up yet another build system in Fedora. This led to
a discussion about Copr&#39;s capabilities and whether it would integrate
well with rebuilderd. Jędrzejewski-Szmek <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z9vUWrmpqwMi4RDm@kawka3.in.waw.pl/">noted</a>
that rebuilderd is a &#34;<q>complete project that does things in its own
way</q>&#34; and it may be complicated to try to teach it to talk to an
external service asynchronously.</p>

<p>Integrating rebuilderd tooling and reports into Fedora&#39;s existing
infrastructure has been a recurring theme in the discussion. Simon de
Vlieger <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/e47d555a-9bb1-42fd-81ad-6c08eaee5214@app.fastmail.com/#t">said</a>
he was not set on having builds performed in Koji, but wanted the
project &#34;<q>to integrate well with Fedora&#39;s <span>pre-existing</span> tools and things so it has the
highest chance of people actually using it</q>&#34; and performing as
people expect.</p>

<h4>Next</h4>

<p>The next step for the proposal is to file a <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/#ticket-votes">ticket</a>
with the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (FESCo), at least one
week after the proposal was <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/CAJqbrbcQ2g-rWNUQ4ee2g8bOR3z-_bgvGL+zNKBS48+C5GVFmw@mail.gmail.com/#t">announced</a>. In
this case, that would be no sooner than March 26. If FESCo
approves, the owners can begin work on the proposal with an eye to
completion by October, when Fedora 43 is planned for release.</p>

<p>Most of Fedora&#39;s users have probably not noticed the
reproducibility work in Fedora thus far and won&#39;t appreciate any
difference when they install Fedora 43 (or 44, 45, and so
on). However, given the continual efforts of bad actors to find and
exploit supply-chain weaknesses in open-source projects, it is a
valuable effort nonetheless.</p></div></div>
