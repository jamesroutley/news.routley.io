    <h1>Show HN: LangCSS â€“ An AI Assistant for Tailwind</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h2>Edit while you chat</h2><p>You can edit the HTML, then carry on the conversation. Some tweaks are better done by humans, after all.</p></div><div><h2>Up To Speed With Great Components</h2><p>(Coming Soon) Make use of the best free components from tailwindui, shadcn, flowbite, daisyui and more.</p></div><div><h2>I Know Some SVG Too!</h2><p>The AI is tuned for Tailwind, but it doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t help with other stuff while you are there. It helped design our logo!</p></div><div><h2>It&#39;s Your Code</h2><p>Whatever it produces is yours to use, we won&#39;t require a license. Also, we don&#39;t look at your questions unless you have purposefully opted in to help us do research to improve the AI.</p></div><div><h2>Full Code Editor</h2><p>Decent code editor so you don&#39;t need to leave the browser to fiddle.</p></div><div><h2>Undo, Back, Save</h2><p>(Coming soon) Flip through previous designs. Go back if the conversation takes the wrong turn. Save your chats for later.</p></div><div><h2>Streaming</h2><p> Our assistant streams, so that you see the answers being produced immediately. No waiting for minutes just staring at a spinner.</p></div><div><h2>World Class AI Providers</h2><p>We are currently using services from OpenAI, but our code is loosely coupled and can support others, if the best AI for this app changes, we will use it!</p></div></div></div><div id="pricing"><section><div><div><div><p><span>POPULAR</span></p><div><h3>PRO MONTHLY</h3><h2>$29.99<span>/mo</span></h2><p><span>Ideal for starting out</span></p></div><p>Unlimited</p><p>Unlimited*</p></div><div><div><h3>PRO ANNUAL</h3><h2>$251.99<span>/year</span></h2><p><span>Best Value</span></p></div><p>Unlimited</p><p>Unlimited*</p></div></div></div><p>* Unimited, subject to fair usage. We monitor overall usage of our AI
        services, and if we find someone is using it excesively we may ask them
        to stop, or limit that account. If you are using the tool normally this
        almost certainly won&#39;t happen. If you are writing code to automate usage
        of the tool or write code to interact directly to the API it might
        happen.</p></section></div></div>
