    <h1>We&#39;re starting a community space</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

    <p>We are starting a community space. We don’t have a location yet (or even a name), but we’d like to share what we’re going to be doing.</p>


<p>We are here to support you and share what we’ve learnt over the last 8 years of organising community events in the city. There is so much that goes into making a vibrant community happen that every community organizer has to deal with on their own - from logistics to communication, keeping motivation to time-management. Making a sustainable community that’s beyond one or two people volunteering time is hard and often a lonely challenge. We want be be the infrastructure - the literal walls and flooring and lights and location, but also share what we know about community management, marketing, finances, and other common gaps - so you can focus on what actually important: filling the space and making it your community’s home.</p>

<p>We want to better understand what tools and support you need. Managing communication on social media and email newsletters? Helping understand your audience and how to price your tickets? Provide you with good photos of the event to post? Connect you with potential sponsors or partners?</p>

<p>We mean it when we say <em>your</em> community. We want to be in the background. (no need to add our logo to your event posters!)</p>

<p>We don’t view the space as an asset to lease to who pays the most, nor do we want to ask a flat rent from you for using the space. (unless it’s a private event)</p>

<p>We hope to make a case for you to share a minority portion of the revenue you generate from your event (via ticket sales) so we both are incentivised to make an event that many people want to attend. We’ll make sure to earn that portion with the value we offer. We’ll negotiate this with each organiser independently, as we would like the flexibility to give away the space for free to communities that are still very nascent, and have the bigger communities subsidise the space for others.</p>

<p>We intend to first cover our costs (mainly rent, maintenance, furniture, etc) but we’re not quitting our jobs to run this full-time, and won’t be depending on this as our sole income source - atleast in the short term.</p>

<p>We want communities to set themselves up to be more sustainable so things aren’t only hinging on a few people’s motivation, dedication, and time. We want everyone to be able to be compensated for their work, and encourage attendees to contribute to the community’s upkeep - whether that’s through volunteering, sponsoring tickets, or whatever else in-between.</p>

<h2 id="to-those-who-attend-events">To those who attend events,</h2>
<p><small><i>Firstly, thanks for sticking around to read this far.</i></small></p>

<p>Welcoming and inclusive spaces are hard to come by. Making friends as adults is hard. Finding a place where you can disconnect from day-to-day life and indulge in something is invaluable.</p>

<p>We want to be the best place to participate in thoughtful, kind, and interesting community events. Communities around hobbies and interests, run by people who are passionate about them. We’re going to be very picky with whom we host to ensure every community that we host stays true to this philosophy.</p>

<p>There is not a cafe with food &amp; drinks. All events will scheduled with a start and end time. We don’t want to be a space that people come and hang out at whenever they want. There are plenty of those already that do a better job than we could. We specifically want to be a venue where people show up for a specific thing at a specific time.</p>

<h2 id="to-bangalore-culture">To Bangalore culture,</h2>
<p><small><i>Well, at least Indiranagar culture to begin with.</i></small></p>

<p>We want to have something interesting happening every week-night. In our experience, getting people to do something regularly after work is the key to making it a part of their’s lives and schedules.</p>

<p>We’re tired of the default social hangout being a bar or pub. It’s noisy, it’s expensive, it’s repetitive. We want to push more people to try new things, help them meet new people, and have a richer, fuller life as a result.</p>

<p>You deserve a better answer to when friends ask you what you do outside of work.</p>

<h2 id="whats-different-about-us">What’s different about us?</h2>
<p>Hopefully a lot! We know there are already many community spaces in the city, from small cafes to dedicated event spaces. We’ve probably done an event at many of them. We may continue to do events in other places.</p>

<p>There is plenty of room under the tent! We aren’t competing with others and we believe the more options organisers have, the more we’ll be able to raise the bar for everyone.</p>
