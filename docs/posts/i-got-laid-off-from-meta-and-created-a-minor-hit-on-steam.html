    <h1>Show HN: I got laid off from Meta and created a minor hit on Steam</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>I was at FB/Meta from late 2013 to early 2023, mostly working in the compiler/runtime spaces. I got hit in the spring 2023 layoff wave. I immediately started making games in my newfound free time (a lifelong interest, and I even worked in AA(A?) back ca. ~2000), and in October 2023 I stumbled upon the idea of a roguelike pachinko/plinko game inspired by Luck Be A Landlord. Things snowballed quickly, I started talking to publishers, then worked like crazy through all of 2024, almost the hardest I&#39;ve ever worked in my career, and launched the game in December 2024. It&#39;s sold ~200,000 units in its first 10 weeks on Steam. So it&#39;s no Balatro, but I&#39;d still say it did very well :) AMA?</p><p>(my game is Ballionaire: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2667120/view/526461473225965590" rel="nofollow">https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2667120/view/5264614...</a>)</p></div></td></div></div>
