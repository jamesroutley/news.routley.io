While Bartending one day, I had a bachelorette party walk into the bar and they had dick everything - straws, inflatables, glitter - and of course - Dick Candy. This, fueled with the combination of wanting to tell someone to &#39;go fuck themselves&#39; led to the idea of sending someone a bag of dick candy with the message : EAT A BAG OF DICKS.</p></div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Nk5vGq2.png" alt="phrase-nothing-new-been-said-years-some-form-another-after-quick-search-doing-this-There-were-few-websites-based-around-name-"/></p><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Nk5vGq2.png" width="550" height="550" loading="lazy" alt="phrase-nothing-new-been-said-years-some-form-another-after-quick-search-doing-this-There-were-few-websites-based-around-name-" draggable="auto"/></p></div></div></div><p>This phrase was nothing new. It had been said for years in some form or another, but after a quick search - nobody was doing this idea. There were a few websites based around the name, but nobody selling a product, especially nobody selling a product you could anonymously ship to others. 

The idea of anonymously shipping pranks didn&#39;t come from me - it came from me though it was something that had come out just before.</p></div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FB2zZvVg.jpg" alt="SHIPYOURENEMIESGLITTER-simply-site-sent-out-letters-filled-with-herpes-of-craft-world-Nobody-likes-glitter-worst-someone-home"/></p><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FB2zZvVg.jpg" width="2368" height="3200" loading="lazy" alt="SHIPYOURENEMIESGLITTER-simply-site-sent-out-letters-filled-with-herpes-of-craft-world-Nobody-likes-glitter-worst-someone-home" draggable="auto"/></p></div></div></div><p>SHIPYOURENEMIESGLITTER was a simply site that sent out letters filled with the herpes of the craft world. Nobody likes glitter. It was the worst thing to send to someone in a home or office, and ruined your day. Dick Shaped Candy on the other hand was a funny treat that you could send equally to friends or enemies, and would be a harmless, anonymous prank.</p></div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lKP0vrmg.jpg" alt="Now-had-by-put-test-find-these-gummies-can-ship-people-actually-BUY-looked-shops-solution-gummy-13-piece-CHEAP-spending-money"/></p><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lKP0vrmg.jpg" width="1000" height="747" loading="lazy" alt="Now-had-by-put-test-find-these-gummies-can-ship-people-actually-BUY-looked-shops-solution-gummy-13-piece-CHEAP-spending-money" draggable="auto"/></p></div></div></div><p>Now that I had by &#34; Business Idea&#34; it was time to put it to the test. Can I find these gummies? can i ship them? Would people actually BUY them? 

I looked at sex toy shops for my solution and found bags of gummy dicks for about $13 a piece - NOT CHEAP, but spending that money would give me answers. It was time to eat a bag of dicks. 
I bought my first bag and tried them. They were....ok. Not great candy, but it&#39;s not meant to be great, it&#39;s meant to be funny. I&#39;d shared with friends the basic idea, and they all fully supported me. 
The other thing I got from that first bag of dicks - was the supplier information. I found a wholesaler, and placed an order for about a dozen bags. This cut my cost in half vs reselling from a sex toy store, so I was pretty happy to be able to order those first 12 bags and see where it got me. 
While I was only about $100 in at this point, it was the first time I took a real step towards building a business. I&#39;ve seen business started with ZERO inventory, they just took a leap and see what stuck.</p></div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NZEbNZg.png" alt="hand-tile-get-going-turned-Shopify-build-2-week-free-promo-only-spent-money-Speaking-domain-there-were-few-already-taken-woul"/></p><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NZEbNZg.png" width="700" height="394" loading="lazy" alt="hand-tile-get-going-turned-Shopify-build-2-week-free-promo-only-spent-money-Speaking-domain-there-were-few-already-taken-woul" draggable="auto"/></p></div></div></div><p>With Dicks in hand, it was tile to get going. I turned to Shopify to build a website. they had a 2 week free promo, so i only spent money on the domain! Speaking of the domain - there were a few domains already taken that would have been MUCH better than what I settled on. But, I went with something that was fun, and easy to understand. I used a template website builder and set everything up, after just enough drinks to be funny, I was happy with the site, and set it live. 

On a side note, eventually, some of those older (better) domains  started selling bags of dicks anonymously too. One event went hardcore into saying I ripped them off (and they privately threatened me like a year after I started!) Luckily, The WAYBACKMACHINE shows that they started after me, so threat or no, I at least had the truth on my side.</p></div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EZ1yHwV.gif" alt="first-week-ok-sold-5-6-word-mouth-posting-facebook-family-shipped-some-friends-decided-do-photoshoot-like-packages-night-what"/></p><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EZ1yHwV.gif" width="320" height="178" loading="lazy" alt="first-week-ok-sold-5-6-word-mouth-posting-facebook-family-shipped-some-friends-decided-do-photoshoot-like-packages-night-what" draggable="auto"/></p></div></div></div><p>The first week of sales was...ok. I sold about 5-6 from word of mouth and posting on facebook, so it was all friends and family. I shipped the orders, and some friends and I decided to do a photoshoot of what it would be like to get one of the packages, and post it on Imgur one night to see what happened. 

Yeah, we made a fake post and just lied to everyone on the internet. I&#39;m not sorry, because not only was it popular - it became the top post of the day. We added the link to the site for people to order, and boy did they order. 

The next 3 days saw a lot of sales. 
Day 1) From the IMGUR post saw about $1000 in sales (about 50 total orders) 
Day 2) It was shared through the many websites and blogs and saw about $30,000 in sales. 
Day 3) It was making rounds to actual TV new networks and sites and saw over $70,000 in sales. 

I didn&#39;t have the inventory to fulfill these orders. I may have need to refund EVERYTHING. It would have taken weeks to pack and ship it all. The app on my phone didn&#39;t even work anymore because SO MANY orders were getting placed at a time. 

Luckily on day 2 of the viral success, I went into problem solving mode. I contacted several suppliers and asked around about pricing. One company both HAD the stock, and was able to offer a great discount on the bulk order. I had to get my dad to put it on his credit card (fun conversation) as I ordered around $10,000 worth of Gummy Dicks. 

The next problem I ran into was shipping. See, I live in Canada, and our post system is TERRIBLE for small businesses. It&#39;s expensive, and not set up to be very friendly. I support the postal service, and believe it&#39;s a great service, but America has a much better system.</p></div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ahaJ5lU.png" alt="turned-internet-fulfilling-someone-suggested-Essentially-company-stores-ships-agreed-Canada-would-have-cost-12-each-Keeping-t"/></p><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ahaJ5lU.png" width="550" height="550" loading="lazy" alt="turned-internet-fulfilling-someone-suggested-Essentially-company-stores-ships-agreed-Canada-would-have-cost-12-each-Keeping-t" draggable="auto"/></p></div></div></div><p>I turned to the internet for help on fulfilling, and someone suggested a fulfillment center. Essentially a company that stores your product and ships it out for an agreed price. 

In Canada, it would have cost me $8-12 for SHIPPING each bag of dicks. 
Keeping things in an American fulfillment center got shipping costs closer to $4. That combined with the Fulfillment costs, product costs, and packaging - Still only came to about $8 shipped - on a $20 product, not bad. 

Taking the time to work out the problem of being TOO successful TOO quickly really saved some headaches, and money. There was a lot of luck involved, but tons of experts willing to help with some advice, and lots of options to get what I need. 

It was around this time that I asked myself &#34;Do I want to be the BAG OF DICKS guy?&#34; and looked over to what The Glitter Guy was doing. The SHIPYOURENEMIESGLITTER site was also a fast success, and had recently sold for over $100K, which was a prospect that sounded pretty good to me. I had a website reach out to me that specialized in selling websites, and they wanted a high selling business like this to promote. They made some guarantees on the price and process, and we put the site up for sale.

This is all still within 10 days of the site going live.</p></div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uSyveto.gif" alt="Unfortunately-service-offered-auction-off-website-bad-job-Someone-somewhere-dropped-ball-verified-bidder-not-What-supposed-be"/></p><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uSyveto.gif" width="220" height="245" loading="lazy" alt="Unfortunately-service-offered-auction-off-website-bad-job-Someone-somewhere-dropped-ball-verified-bidder-not-What-supposed-be" draggable="auto"/></p></div></div></div><p>Unfortunately, the service that offered to auction off my website did a bad job. Someone, somewhere dropped the ball and what was supposed to be a verified bidder - was not. What was supposed to be a $100k offer, was a bag of lies. 

But, I got a private message from a different group who was actually looking to buy. 

They made a bigger offer that included some royalties for a few years, and we agreed on the sale. 

I was still doing some interviews for a few different online sources, and - after sitting down with my local VICE reporter, I ended up becoming known as THE BAG OF DICKS GUY anyway - whoops.</p></div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SO8vnTng.jpg" alt="Should-sold-off-Who-knows-could-kept-up-momentum-buyers-We-both-made-good-happier-having-don-t-like-live-regrets-asking-what-"/></p><div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SO8vnTng.jpg" width="800" height="960" loading="lazy" alt="Should-sold-off-Who-knows-could-kept-up-momentum-buyers-We-both-made-good-happier-having-don-t-like-live-regrets-asking-what-" draggable="auto"/></p></div></div></div><p>Should I have sold off the business? Who knows if I could have kept up the momentum that the buyers did. We both made some good money, and I&#39;m happier for having done it. I don&#39;t like to live with the regrets of asking &#34;what if?&#34; and am very happy to have learned those lessons that carry me forward with other projects. 

In the last decade I&#39;ve learned a lot about business and marketing, and have had other successful projects, and hundreds of other ideas. Some I&#39;ve tried, some have sat on a shelf. The biggest thing I learned was to not be afraid to try. It&#39;s one of the reasons I&#39;ve stuck around Imgur so long - there&#39;s an extremely diverse, and supportive community. Yes, people are still wary about posting businesses and projects at the risk of being burned at the stake for being a soulless corporate shill, but there are many great communities that support people being creative and trying to work for themselves. 

You may have noticed I&#39;ve done my best to not actually drop any links to the site (which, again, I no longer own, nor do I get any money from), but I&#39;m happy to answer any questions people may have in regards to taking these first steps. Since COVID I&#39;ve been reluctant start any new projects, but with my brain overflowing on ideas - I decided to walk down memory lane before taking the first step into something new. 

Make 2025 the year that YOU take the step you were once reluctant to take.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
