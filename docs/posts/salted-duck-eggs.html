<p><span id="more-22990"></span>I am reading a brilliant book at the moment entitled <em>Four Thousand Weeks</em>. The premise is that, if we live to 80 years of age, we would have covered 4,000 weeks in time. It&#8217;s not that we should count every week, but make every week count.</p>
<p>I never lie about my age. Next year I will turn 60 and there is not a day that passes by when I am not thankful for having reached this far.</p>
<p>When I look back to my oldest posts on this blog, I realise there are some things I have not made as regularly as I would have liked. Spotting some fresh duck eggs last weekend reminded me of making <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/tag/salted-duck-egg/">salted duck eggs</a>. Like pickles, this is a make-ahead item that you stash away and retrieve when you need something ready-made to liven up another dish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The duck eggs came in various sizes, ranging from 65 g per egg to a whopping 120 g!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To accommodate the duck eggs and brine I had to turf out three batches of pickles (sorry!) from their jars and put into smaller bottles. The jars were first hand-washed then put in the dishwasher for further washing and drying thus sterilising it.</p>
<p>I did not add any aromatics to the brine and kept it simple. Once the eggs are brining it is a matter of waiting, a month minimum and up to two months. This is a very good project for cheering up the colder days and longer nights fast approaching.</p>
<p>Since some of the eggs were quite large I have adapted the original recipe from Yan-kit So. I imagine the eggs she used were uniform in size, perhaps 75 g &#8211; 80 g each. Duck eggs are always larger than hen&#8217;s eggs in any case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Eggs:</p>
<p>400 g sea salt</p>
<p>1.6 litres boiling water</p>
<p>18 duck eggs, weight upwards of 75 g each</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also need 3 x 2-litre glass preserving jars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to Make:</p>
<p>Put the salt in a large plastic or glass jug. Pour in the boiling water to dissolve the salt, giving it a big stir. Leave to cool completely.</p>
<p>Wash the eggs, brushing with a fine brush so that the pores are open for better absorption of the brine later. Wipe dry.</p>
<p>Put the eggs into one or more large glass jars. Make sure there are no cracks in any of the eggs, otherwise the whole lot may be spoiled.</p>
<p>Add the cold brine. Some eggs will float to the surface. I crushed a piece of baking parchment and placed this on top of the jar, pushing down the eggs and submerging them in the brine. Fasten the lid of the jar.</p>
<p>Store the eggs in the fridge for a minimum of 28 days at the end of which take one out to try. Use a sterilised metal spoon to remove the eggs so as not to contaminate the brine.</p>
<p>When cracked, the egg white should be cloudy and the yolk coagulated. When hard-boiled, the egg white should be very salty, and the egg-yolk golden and oily.</p>
<p>If they are not ready, leave them for 1 or 2 more weeks.</p>
<p>I was originally intending to boil the salted duck eggs to eat with congee. That&#8217;s how I remember my dad eating them. Another recipe would be to mix the raw egg white with minced pork, adding some grated ginger and finely sliced spring onion greens. Make a dip in the middle and place the egg yolk in this. Steam the whole dish until cooked. Served with rice, this is a home-style dish that is simple and comforting at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Label the bottle with the date the eggs were brined</p>

<p>The Book:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Four Thousand Weeks: Embrace your limits. Change your life. Make your four thousand weeks count</em>, by Oliver Burkemann, published by Vintage, ISBN 978-1784704001 (paperback) and 978-0735232464 (hardcover).</p>
<p>The Egg Vendor:</p>
<p>If you live anywhere near Ottery St Mary (East Devon) then you can get fresh hen and duck eggs from a stall along the top end of Bendarroch Road (Prickly Pear House). Currently the price is £1.80 for half a dozen hen eggs, and £3 for half a dozen duck eggs. It has just occurred to me that most countries might not use &#8216;a dozen&#8217; so presumably they sell eggs in boxes of 10 or maybe 15. I should check this out next time I travel to a foreign country.</p>
