    <h1>Show HN: An MCP server for understanding AWS costs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey all - I work at Vantage, a FinOps platform.</p><p>I know AI is peak hype right now. But it has definitely changed some of our dev workflows already. So we wanted to find a way to let our customers experiment with how they can use AI to make their cloud cost management work more productive.</p><p>The MCP Server acts as a connector between LLMs (right now only Claude, Cursor support it but ChatGPT and Google Gemini coming soon) and your cost and usage data on Vantage which supports 20+ cloud infra providers including AWS, Datadog, Mongo, etc. (You have to have a Vantage account to use it since it&#39;s using the Vantage API)</p><p>Video demo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0VP2NlUvRU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0VP2NlUvRU</a></p><p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/vantage-sh/vantage-mcp-server">https://github.com/vantage-sh/vantage-mcp-server</a></p><p>It&#39;s really impressive how capable the latest-gen models are with an MCP server and an API. So far we have found it useful for:</p><p>Ad-Hoc questions: &#34;What&#39;s our non-prod cloud spend per engineer if we have 25 engineers&#34;</p><p>Action plans: &#34;Find unallocated spend and look for clues how it should be tagged&#34;</p><p>Multi-tool workflows: &#34;Find recent cost spikes that look like they could have come from eng changes and look for GitHub PR&#39;s merged around the same time&#34; (using it in combination with the GitHub MCP)</p><p>Thought I&#39;d share, let me know if you have questions.</p></div></div></div>
