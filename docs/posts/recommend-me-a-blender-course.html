    <h1>Ask HN: Recommend me a Blender course</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Finally, I want to dedicate some time to learn Blender.</p><p>I&#39;m primarily interested in modeling but will need an intro to Blender concepts, philosophy, and UI idiosyncrasies.</p><p>I have some professional experience in CAD and Finite Element Analysis modeling, so I&#39;m not a complete noob in that respect. Blender is sufficiently different from everything I know, though I feel my experience is more of a hindrance than a benefit.</p><p>Now, the plan is to just go with the flow and do things the Blender way.</p><p>Does anyone know a course that teaches the basics and enough basic modeling to get started?</p><p>- Paid courses are OK</p><p>- Video is preferred</p><p>- Language must be English or German</p><p>It should be less than 8 hours long; shorter and high info density is better. Most courses are dragged ridiculously on platforms that pay creators by course length (Udemy, AFAIK), and I don&#39;t have time for that.</p><p>Any tips and hints would be greatly appreciated!</p></div></div></div>
