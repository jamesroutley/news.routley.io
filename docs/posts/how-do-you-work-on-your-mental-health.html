    <h1>Ask HN: How do you work on your mental health?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the spirit of the season (you know, new year, new goals, temporary motivation that might last 10-20 days), I&#39;d like to ask what all of you are doing or would like to do to improve your mental health. Are there any particular things you&#39;ve noticed work for you that have made a meaningful difference? Any new ideas that you&#39;ve read about that you&#39;d like to try?</p><p>Personally, I&#39;m experimenting with the idea of automated personal/positive affirmations based on something I read in the book &#34;Indistractable&#34;:</p><p>&gt; For example, short text messages providing words of encouragement are effective at helping smokers quit. A metastudy of interventions form ten countries found that &#34;the evidence provides unequivocal support for the efficacy of text messaging interventions to reduce smoking behavior.</p></div></div></div>
