But researchers found that some Iberian harvester ant populations have no <em>M. structor</em> colonies nearby.</p><p id="b751b378-6387-41e6-954c-a55161598d4d-2" aria-hidden="true">&#34;That was very, very abnormal.

They found that 58 were covered in hair and 74 were hairless. A closer inspection of the nuclear genomes of a subset of these ants revealed that all hairy ones were <em>M. ibericus</em> and all bald ones were <em>M. structor</em>.</p><p>But this was not proof that the queens were laying male eggs of two different species — there could have been some hidden <em>M. structor </em>queens producing the odd male. So the team sequenced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Mitochondrial-DNA" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Mitochondrial-DNA" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>mitochondrial DNA</u></a>, which is passed down by the mother, of 24 of the <em>M. structor</em> males, and found it came from the same mother as the <em>M. ibericus </em>male nestmates.</p><p>&#34;This was the detail that made me realize that &#39;maybe we are on to something very, very, very big,&#39;&#34; Romiguier said.</p><p id="6b230632-a9cb-470d-944f-c19033d9acd2">The team then separated 16 queens from laboratory colonies and looked at the genetic sequences of their freshly laid eggs. They found that 9% of their eggs contained <em>M. structor</em> ants. They then directly observed a single queen producing males of both species by monitoring its broods weekly over an 18-month period.</p><p>Together, all these findings show that Iberian harvester ant queens are cloning <em>M. structor</em> males and not passing on any of their own nuclear DNA. Researchers now need to pinpoint the exact mechanism underlying this cloning, Romiguier said, and find out at what point the maternal DNA is removed.</p><p id="0c79d4e8-8fd7-427a-8925-ed2ba6ad8d4f"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ebe.ulb.be/ebe/Fournier.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://ebe.ulb.be/ebe/Fournier.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>Denis Fournier</u></a>, an evolutionary biologist and ecologist at the Free University of Brussels, Belgium, who was not involved in the research, said that it was &#34;almost like science fiction&#34; when he first learned of this discovery. &#34;It&#39;s jaw-dropping! Most of us learn that species boundaries are firm, yet here is a system where ants regularly cross them as part of normal life,&#34; he told Live Science in an email.</p><p>The team have called this new reproductive system &#34;xenoparity,&#34; meaning the birth of a different species. Romiguier said the team aren&#39;t exactly sure when this system first emerged in the Iberian harvester ants, but it&#39;s somewhere between when <em>M. ibericus </em>and <em>M. structor</em> split along different evolutionary paths 5 million years ago and a few thousand years ago.</p><p>&#34;This discovery is a great reminder to stay open to the unexpected,&#34; Fournier said, noting that the finding opens up new questions about cooperation, conflict and dependency in nature. &#34;Now that we know such a system is possible, it’s exciting to think that old, puzzling data might suddenly make sense in light of this discovery,&#34; he added.</p>
