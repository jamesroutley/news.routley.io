    <h1>Today&#39;s thought</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>We are currently visiting my sisters (cousins) who were on school vacation in the past week and just got back to school this week. Last night one of my sisters came to me with a piece of paper and told me that she would like to practice a speech. It was a very small essay called “Today’s Thought”. It seems like an essay that is containing a thought would be read by a student every day in their morning school gathering where they do prayers. It was my sister’s chance to read out “Today’s thought” for today (hope she did great! I will get to know once gets home today.)</p>
<p>I asked my sister to read out and practice in front of us yesterday. It was great to listen to her - like a piece of wisdom that I seek for a long while yet unattained. Sometimes some thoughts are known to us, but maybe somewhere along the lines we forget or things change that we miss that viewpoint that made us good in the past. So, I would like to share “Today’s thought” that was read by her to us in this blog post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today’s thought:</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid to start again. This time, you’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience.”</p>
<p>Meaning - Failure is common in life and we need to start again. However, we should not fear to start again because this time, we have the support of our experience. Experience will make it easy for us to start and win again.</p>
<p>I repeat the thought:</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid to start again. This time, you’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience.”</p>
