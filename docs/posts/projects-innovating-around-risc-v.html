RISC-V is in many senses an ‘old-school’ RISC ISA with some refinements, so it may not drive future innovations in CPU design. </span><strong>Rather, it&#39;s about innovation around the processor design itself, or about enabling projects that would otherwise have been more difficult or expensive.</strong></p><p>So I thought it would be interesting to have a look at a few RISC-V projects that could claim to be innovating around the RISC-V architecture.</p><p>They are a mix of the highly commercial and the extremely fun. They range from startups with tens of millions of dollars of funding, to hobby projects to build ‘virtual cores’ that run in online games. From projects that aim to be at the cutting edge of AI to those with a ‘retro’ flavour.</p><p>What they all have in common is that designers will all have had a copy of the RISC-V ISA specification open on their desktop for extended periods. One could argue, in some cases, that if RISC-V didn&#39;t exist then maybe they would have developed their own ISA. It’s certain, though, that in each case that the existence of RISC-V saved the designers effort and it’s use has made the project more accessible to others.</p><p>Let’s start with the more ambitious and serious, and then move on to the more fun projects.</p><p><span>P.S. Do please share if you have your own favourite project that is innovating around RISC-V. </span><strong>Comments can only be accessed by paying subscribers but everyone can just reply to this email if you’d like to share a less well known project. </strong><span>It would be great to do a sequel!</span></p><p>Esperanto sits at the intersection of two groups of startups: RISC-V (with SiFive, Tenstorrent, Ventana etc) and AI accelerators (with Cerebras, GraphCore etc).</p><p><span>It has a pedigree that is second to none. Dave Ditzel, its founder and executive chairman was co-author, with David Patterson, of the original </span><a href="https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/risc-on-a-chip-david-patterson-and" rel="">Berkeley RISC paper</a><span>. He may have had an extended period in the RISC wilderness working on x86 designs at Intel and Transmeta, but he’s now returned to his Berkeley RISC roots.</span></p><p>The company was founded in 2014 and has, so far, raised around $65m.</p><p>So what makes Esperanto innovative? </p><p>Here is a slide that contrasts their approach with other machine learning accelerators. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8cee46c-cb4e-4c9c-861e-78b48e0a33ec_2840x1594.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8cee46c-cb4e-4c9c-861e-78b48e0a33ec_2840x1594.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8cee46c-cb4e-4c9c-861e-78b48e0a33ec_2840x1594.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8cee46c-cb4e-4c9c-861e-78b48e0a33ec_2840x1594.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8cee46c-cb4e-4c9c-861e-78b48e0a33ec_2840x1594.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8cee46c-cb4e-4c9c-861e-78b48e0a33ec_2840x1594.jpeg" width="1200" height="673.3516483516484" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8cee46c-cb4e-4c9c-861e-78b48e0a33ec_2840x1594.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:false,&#34;imageSize&#34;:&#34;large&#34;,&#34;height&#34;:817,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:1200,&#34;bytes&#34;:354654,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8cee46c-cb4e-4c9c-861e-78b48e0a33ec_2840x1594.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8cee46c-cb4e-4c9c-861e-78b48e0a33ec_2840x1594.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8cee46c-cb4e-4c9c-861e-78b48e0a33ec_2840x1594.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8cee46c-cb4e-4c9c-861e-78b48e0a33ec_2840x1594.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>It’s using lots and lots of RISC-V cores.

First of all, what is or are posits? It’s all about AI and numbers. IEEE Spectrum </span><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/floating-point-numbers-posits-processor" rel="">explains</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Training the large neural networks behind many modern AI tools requires real computational might … </span><strong>Engineers think they have figured out a way to ease the burden by using a different way of representing numbers.</strong></p></blockquote><p><span>Posits were developed by John L. Gustafson and Isaac Yonemoto. According to their </span><a href="http://www.johngustafson.net/pdfs/BeatingFloatingPoint.pdf" rel="">paper</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>A new data type called a posit is designed as a direct drop-in replacement for IEEE Standard 754 floating-point numbers (floats). Unlike earlier forms of universal number (unum) arithmetic, posits do not require interval arithmetic or variable size operands; like floats, they round if an answer is inexact. </span><strong>However, they provide compelling advantages over floats, including larger dynamic range, higher accuracy, better closure, bitwise identical results across systems, simpler hardware, and simpler exception handling.</strong></p></blockquote><p><span>Posits are actually the latest version of Gustafson’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unum_(number_format)" rel="">Unum</a><span> (Universal Number) format. And they seems to have generated a lot of interest.</span></p><blockquote><p>Other teams are working on their own hardware implementations to advance posit usage. “It’s doing exactly what I hoped it would do; it’s getting adopted like crazy,” Gustafson says. “The posit number format caught fire, and there are dozens of groups, both companies and universities, that are using it.”</p></blockquote><p><span>So with its extensibility RISC-V would seem like an ideal base to use to look at the practical issues around implementation of posits. Enter </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01466.pdf" rel="">PERI</a><span>, a core that uses the </span><a href="https://shakti.org.in" rel="">SHAKTI</a><span> RISC-V project, from the Indian Institute of Technology, as a base.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The article provides insights on how the Single-Precision Floating Point (“F”) extension of RISC-V can be leveraged to support </span><em>posit</em><span> arithmetic. We also present the implementation details of a parameterized and feature-complete </span><em>posit</em><span> Floating Point Unit (FPU). </span></p><p><span>The </span><em>posit</em><span> FPU has been integrated with the RISC-V compliant SHAKTI C-class core as an execution unit.</span></p></blockquote><p>The paper then goes on to consider how posits compare with IEEE-754 floating point and to consider how to integrate with other RISC-V cores:</p><blockquote><p><span>The article further highlights the specific differences between </span><em>posit</em><span> and IEEE-754 in view of RISC-V and thereby concludes that </span><em>posit</em><span> simplifies designing of floating-point arithmetic significantly.</span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>We also present an alternate methodology of exploiting the </span><em>custom</em><span> space of RISC-V ISA to integrate the </span><em>posit</em><span> FPU as an accelerator with any RISC-V core supporting a RoCC like interface.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Note that this isn’t the first time that RISC-V has been used as the base for work on posits - the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00364.pdf" rel="">Clarinet</a><span> project was first - but I think it’s first in integrating with a mainstream core like SHAKTI.</span></p><p>A great example of a group trying something out on a real core, that would have not been possible using mainstream commercial architectures.</p><p>… it’s possible to fit 8 RISC-V cores into a single cheap FPGA chip</p><p><span>How small can a 32-bit core be?

For this there is an official </span><a href="https://serv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#" rel="">SERV user manual</a><span> with block diagrams that are correct to the gate-level, cycle-accurate timing diagrams and an in-depth description of how things work.</span></p></blockquote><p>For an introduction, see this presentation ‘32-bit is the new 8-bit’ from developer Olof Kindgren.</p><div id="youtube2-GSHasXHvZaQ" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;GSHasXHvZaQ&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GSHasXHvZaQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>To answer our original ‘how small’ question, it’s possible to fit 8 RISC-V cores into a single cheap FPGA chip!</p><div id="youtube2-xjIxORBRaeQ" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;xjIxORBRaeQ&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xjIxORBRaeQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>We’re going to end with a couple of games where users have built RISC-V processors inside the game itself. </p><p>The video demonstrations really speak for themselves.
