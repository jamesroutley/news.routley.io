    <h2>Quick Start</h2>
    <p>You need Golang installed for this command to work. If you don&#39;t have Golang, you can install it using one of these methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For Mac, Linux, or Windows, use this one-line command to install Go Runtime: <a href="https://webinstall.dev/golang/" target="_blank">https://webinstall.dev/golang/</a></li>
        <li>Or visit the official Go website for installation instructions: <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install" target="_blank">https://go.dev/doc/install</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><code id="commandText">go run github.com/1fpsvideo/1fps@v0.1.1</code>

    <h2>Hassle-free video sharing for:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Developers</li>
        <li>IT teams</li>
        <li>Security professionals</li>
        <li>Meeting-free collaboration enthusiasts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why 1 FPS?</h2>
    <p>We&#39;ve discovered that low FPS video sharing is often sufficient for most collaborative tasks, especially for developers who spend most of their time writing code. Our approach offers several benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Promotes a <span>meeting-free culture</span> by eliminating the need for audio</li>
        <li>Significantly reduces CPU, memory, and network consumption</li>
        <li>Allows older laptops to perform better during screen sharing</li>
        <li>More environmentally friendly due to lower resource usage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is 1 FPS enough?</h2>
    <p>For most coding and development work, absolutely! Plus, we use WebSocket-based cursor tracking, providing smooth, near 30 FPS pointer movement for precise demonstrations.</p>

    <h2>Why choose our service?</h2>
    <p>1fps.video is perfect for introverts and remote workers who prefer sharing their screen without the pressure of audio or video calls. It&#39;s a versatile solution that works alongside any team chat application you&#39;re already using.</p>

    <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
    <p>We take your privacy seriously:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data is <span>end-to-end encrypted</span></li>
        <li>Encryption keys are generated client-side and never sent to our servers</li>
        <li>The key is part of the URL (after the # symbol), which is never transmitted to the backend</li>
        <li>Only those with the full link can access your shared screen</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> We&#39;re currently working on encrypting cursor coordinates for even greater privacy.</p>

    <p>Start sharing your screen effortlessly and securely with 1fps.video today!</p>
