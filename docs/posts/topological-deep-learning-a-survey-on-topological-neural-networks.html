      <span>Abstract:</span>  The natural world is full of complex systems characterized by intricate
relations between their components: from social interactions between
individuals in a social network to electrostatic interactions between atoms in
a protein. Topological Deep Learning (TDL) provides a comprehensive framework
to process and extract knowledge from data associated with these systems, such
as predicting the social community to which an individual belongs or predicting
whether a protein can be a reasonable target for drug development. TDL has
demonstrated theoretical and practical advantages that hold the promise of
breaking ground in the applied sciences and beyond. However, the rapid growth
of the TDL literature has also led to a lack of unification in notation and
language across Topological Neural Network (TNN) architectures. This presents a
real obstacle for building upon existing works and for deploying TNNs to new
real-world problems. To address this issue, we provide an accessible
introduction to TDL, and compare the recently published TNNs using a unified
mathematical and graphical notation. Through an intuitive and critical review
of the emerging field of TDL, we extract valuable insights into current
challenges and exciting opportunities for future development.
