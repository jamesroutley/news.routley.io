    <h1>Debugging iOS Safari on (Fedora) Linux</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

<p>This is a quick one. I had some issues with this and Google rankings didn&#39;t do a great job putting me on the right path, so I figure a quick write up might prove useful to others in this situation.</p>

<h2>Why might you do this?</h2>

<p>You have a website you&#39;re developing and want to ensure functionality on iPhones. You load it up on an iPhone and find your site just doesn&#39;t work. You want to see some logs, maybe inspect some elements, ya know - usual browser debugging stuff. But you don&#39;t have a Mac.</p>

<h2>Getting it working</h2>

<p>Install the following:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/HimbeersaftLP/ios-safari-remote-debug-kit" target="_blank">ios-safari-remote-debug-kit</a> - webkit compiler and static server wrapper</li><li><a href="https://github.com/google/ios-webkit-debug-proxy" target="_blank">ios-webkit-debug-proxy</a> (and its dependencies, see installation instructions in the repo&#39;s README)</li><li>chromium or webkit based browser</li></ul>

<p>Note that it is not sufficient to install the debug proxy alone. I haven&#39;t dug too deeply, but it seems you need some kind of webkit-specific debugger to interpret the debug output exposed by iOS safari. This is why <a href="https://github.com/HimbeersaftLP/ios-safari-remote-debug-kit" target="_blank">ios-safari-remote-debug-kit</a> is an essential piece of the puzzle here.</p>

<p>On Fedora, I had issues connecting to my iPhone13 mini. Eventually I tracked down a likely root cause within <code>usbmuxd</code>, a dependency of <code>ios-webkit-debug-proxy</code>. I found the logs with:</p>

<pre><code>
journalctl -u usbmuxd

</code></pre>

<p>Searching &#34;lockdown error -5&#34; online led me to <a href="https://github.com/libimobiledevice/usbmuxd/issues/207" target="_blank">this issue on the repo</a>.</p>

<p>Running the following and rebooting got things working for me:</p>
<pre><code>
sudo update-crypto-policies --set LEGACY
</code></pre>



<p>Doing stuff targeting Apple devices with a linux machine just kind of sucks. I was relieved to get this working after looking at a blank browser page served by <code>ios-webkit-debug-proxy</code> for a few too many minutes. So, hey, I&#39;m glad there are communities out there trying to keep cross-platform workflows viable!</p>
