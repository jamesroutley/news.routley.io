    <h1>How to get hired in 2025</h1>
    
    
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/hiring-ai/cover.webp"><p>It’s 2025 and you are applying for a software engineer position. They give you a test assignment. You complete it yourself, send it over, and get rejected. Why?</p>
<p>Because it looked like AI.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s 2025, AI is spreading like glitter in a kindergarten, and it’s really easy to mistake hard human labor for soulless, uninspired machine slop.</p>
<p>Following are the main <em>red flags</em> in test assignments that should be <strong>avoided</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The assignment was read and understood in full.</li>
  <li>All parts are implemented.</li>
  <li>Industry-standard tools and frameworks are used.</li>
  <li>The code is split into small, readable functions.</li>
  <li>Variables have descriptive names.</li>
  <li>Complex parts have comments.</li>
  <li>Errors are handled, error messages are easy to follow.</li>
  <li>Source files are organized reasonably.</li>
  <li>The web interface looks nice.</li>
  <li>There are tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid these AI giveaways and spread the word!</p>
