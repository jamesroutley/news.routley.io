<p>Hello!  Welcome to a new qoth.  This qoth covers new and interesting GNU/Hurd
developments in Q2 of 2024!</p>

<p>Sergey Bugaev <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2024-04/msg00023.html">committed public
headers</a> for
the GNU Mach AArch64 port. He writes that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>...there is now a real port of GNU Mach to AArch64, using these headers as
its actual API/ABI. We got the Mach port to run glibc, several Hurd servers,
and simple Unix programs, including things like fork/exec and signal delivery
&amp; handling working, which exercises these architecture-specific definitions
(thread state &amp; exceptions). We have also managed to do some testing on real
hardware; although not everything is working yet, we have seen thread state
manipulation &amp; Mach handling an unaligned SP fault work as expected.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>His email also mentions that the GCC patches that enable GCC to compile GNU/Hurd
programs on AArch64 have been merged! This apparently will make it easier to
merge his AArch64 specific glibc patches.</p>

<p>He also added new tests to check that <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2024-04/msg00031.html">threads handle signals
well</a>, and he
also fixed a <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2024-04/msg00005.html">use-after-free in
vm<em>map</em>pageable_scan()</a>.
He also hosted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ7bWzsL7Ps">lengthy Hurd code
jam</a> (apologies for the poor audio
quality).</p>

<p>He also very notably added support to <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2024-04/msg00001.html">copy a send once
right</a> to
Mach and MIG.</p>

<p>Some time ago, Sergey also wrote the
<a href="https://darnassus.sceen.net/~hurd-web/hurd/terrible-mdns-responder/">terrible-mdns-responder</a>,
and if you would like to be able to type in <code>ssh HOSTNAME.local</code> and connect to
a locally running Hurd, then you may want to try it!</p>

<p>Fl√°vio Cruz fixed some issues with the Hurd compiling
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2024-06/msg00023.html">on</a>
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2024-06/msg00028.html">GCC</a>
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2024-06/msg00024.html">14</a>.</p>

<p>Luca Dariz fixed message sizes, where the size was <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2024-06/msg00015.html">not set by
userspace</a>,
and he added another test to <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2024-06/msg00014.html">check message sizes on various code
paths</a>.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Hurd now offers an experimental <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2024/04/msg00006.html">SMP GNU Mach
kernel</a> (32-bit
only) and the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2024/05/msg00016.html">official rustc
compiler</a>! Now that
we have ported rustc to Debian GNU/Hurd, we can compile important packages like
librsvg. Debian GNU/Hurd now can compile <a href="https://logs.guix.gnu.org/hurd/2024-06-25.log">71% of the packages from the Debian
archive</a>.</p>

<p>Now for something trivial but fun! I updated the guide on the Hurd wiki that
shows how one can run their own <a href="https://darnassus.sceen.net/~hurd-web/hurd/translator/ext2fs/">personal ext2fs
translator</a>.</p>

<p>You could go crazy even! Why not make something like this:</p>

<pre><code> ~/silly &lt;--&gt; silly.fs
    |   \
    |    \
    |     \
    |      \
    |       \
   \|/       \/
  silly1 &lt;-&gt; silly1.fs
        ...

 /hurd/joshua/silly/silly1/silly2/silly3/silly4
</code></pre>

<p>Each sillyN is another ext2fs filesystem! Make sure that as N gets bigger
sillyN.fs gets smaller. Let us know in the #hurd irc channel how &#34;silly&#34;
you are. <img src="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/smileys/smile.png" alt=":)"/></p>

<p>The current record is <code>~/silly1/silly2</code> where each <code>sillyN</code> is a different
ext2fs. Does anyone want to volunteer to beat the current record?</p>

<p>So if you want to test if your favorite packages work on the Hurd and
contribute towards making the full GNU system usable for a wider range
of people, please <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/contributing.html">check the contributing page</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The <strong>GNU Hurd</strong> is the GNU project&#39;s replacement for the Unix kernel.  It is a
collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel to implement file
systems, network protocols, file access control, and other features that are
implemented by the Unix kernel or similar kernels (such as Linux).  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/documentation.html">More
detailed</a>.</p>

<p><strong>GNU Mach</strong> is the microkernel upon which a GNU Hurd system is based.  It
provides an Inter Process Communication (IPC) mechanism that the Hurd uses to
define interfaces for implementing in a distributed multi-server fashion the
services a traditional operating system kernel provides.  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/mach/gnumach.html">More
detailed</a>.</p>
