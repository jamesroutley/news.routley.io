      <p>As many of you know I recently concluded a six-part series on Sudoku
solvers in which we implemented Sudoku solvers in six different
programming languages. I had a ton of fun with the series, but it left
me feeling like I barely scratched the surface. There are so many cool
languages out there that I want to get my grubby little hands on and
play with!</p>
<p>So I decided to <a href="http://blog.veitheller.de/sss/index.html">make it a real
series</a>. Each season will have six episodes, and the series we just
concluded will be ret-conned into being the first season instead. So far
I mapped out three seasons of increasing obscurity. I have a pretty good
idea of how I’ll tackle all the languages in season two, but thinking
about some of the implementations for season three gives me sweaty
fingers already, which is more than exciting.</p>
<p>Take a look at the list and <a href="mailto:veit@veitheller.de">let
me know what you think</a>! Did I forget anything? Do you have any
favorite languages I should add? Will we need a fourth season? Who will
make it through this entire series with me?</p>
