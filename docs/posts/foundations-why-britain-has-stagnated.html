          <p>
            Here are some facts to set the scene about the state of the British
            economy.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Between 2004 and 2021, before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,
              <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/gas-and-electricity-prices-in-the-non-domestic-sector">the industrial price of energy tripled in nominal terms</a>, or doubled relative to consumer prices.
            </li>
            <li>
              With almost identical population sizes, the UK has under
              <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/researchoutputssubnationaldwellingstockbytenureestimatesengland2012to2015/2020">30 million homes</a>, while France has around
              <a href="https://www.insee.fr/en/statistiques/5009609">37 million</a>.
              <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-housing-survey-2021-to-2022-second-homes-fact-sheet/english-housing-survey-2021-to-2022-second-homes-fact-sheet">800,000 British families</a>
              have second homes compared to
              <a href="https://www.thelocal.fr/20240712/explained-why-so-many-french-people-have-second-homes">3.4 million French families</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Per capita electricity generation in the UK is just two thirds of
              what it is in France (4,800 kilowatt-hours per year in Britain
              versus 7,300 kilowatt-hours per year in France) and barely over a
              third of what it is in the United States (12,672 kilowatt-hours
              per year). We are
              <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-electricity-source-stacked">closer to developing countries like Brazil and South Africa</a>
              in terms of per capita electricity output than we are to Germany,
              China, Japan, Sweden, or Canada.
            </li>
            <li>
              Britain’s last nuclear power plant
              <a href="https://www.imeche.org/policy-and-press/from-our-perspective/energy-theme/nuclear-power/about-nuclear-power/nuclear-uk/britains-most-recent">was built between 1987 and 1995</a>. Its next one,
              <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/how-to-get-new-nuclear-built-faster">Hinkley Point C, is between four</a>
              and
              <a href="https://www.britainremade.co.uk/plan#plan_energy">six times</a>
              more costly per megawatt of capacity than South Korean nuclear
              power plants, and
              <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/KHNP-selected-to-supply-new-Czech-nuclear-units">four times as expensive</a>
              as those that South Korea’s KEPCO has agreed to build in Czechia.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tram projects in Britain are
              <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/britains-infrastructure-is-too-expensive">two and a half times more expensive</a>
              than French projects on a per mile basis. In the last 25 years,
              France has built
              <a href="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/britainremade/pages/1451/attachments/original/1723813389/BRM7607_Tram_Report_Digital-Single-Pages_AWK.pdf?1723813389">21 tramways</a>
              in different cities, including cities with populations of just
              150,000, equivalent to Lincoln or Carlisle. The UK has still not
              managed to build a tramway in Leeds, the largest city in Europe
              without mass transit, with a population of nearly 800,000.
            </li>
            <li>
              At £396 million,
              <a href="https://x.com/Sam_Dumitriu/status/1694990889787986094">each mile of HS2 will cost more than four times more</a>
              than each mile of the Naples to Bari high speed line. It will be
              more than eight times more expensive per mile than France’s high
              speed link between Tours and Bordeaux.
            </li>
            <li>
              Britain
              <a href="https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/the-challenge-of-building-more-reservoirs-to-ensure-uks-water-resilience-01-09-2022/">has not built a new reservoir since 1992</a>. Since then, Britain’s population has grown by 10 million.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite huge and rising demand, Heathrow annual flight numbers
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport#/media/File:London_Heathrow_Statistics.png">have been almost completely flat since 2000</a>. Annual passenger numbers have risen by 10 million because
              planes have become larger, but this still compares poorly to the
              22 million added at Amsterdam’s Schiphol and the 15 million added
              at Paris’s Charles de Gaulle. The right to take off and land at
              Heathrow once per week is worth
              <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/it-time-auction-slots-congested-airports">tens of millions of pounds</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The planning documentation for the Lower Thames Crossing, a
              proposed tunnel under the Thames connecting Kent and Essex, runs
              to 360,000 pages, and the application process alone has cost £297
              million. That is
              <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/a-boring-story-about-infrastructure">more than twice as much</a>
              as it cost in Norway to <em>actually build</em> the longest road
              tunnel in the world.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These are not just disconnected observations. They highlight the
            most important economic fact about modern Britain: that it is
            difficult to build almost anything, anywhere. This prevents
            investment, increases energy costs, and makes it harder for
            productive economic clusters to expand. This, in turn, lowers our
            productivity, incomes, and tax revenues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone reading this will already be aware of the country’s present
            economic sclerosis. Real wage growth has been flat for 16 years.
            Average weekly wages are only
            <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/averageweeklyearningsearn01">0.8 percent</a>
            higher today than their previous peak in 2008. Annual real wages are
            <em>6.9 percent lower</em> for the median full-time worker today
            than they were in 2008. This essay argues that Britain’s economy has
            stagnated for a fundamentally simple reason: because it has banned
            the investment in housing, transport and energy that it most vitally
            needs. Britain has denied its economy the foundations it needs to
            grow on.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 2010 to the summer of 2024, Britain was run by Conservative-led
            or Conservative Governments. The Conservatives are the traditional
            party of business, and in the 1930s and 1980s they pushed through
            reform programmes that successfully renewed Britain’s economy.
            Virtually any Conservative minister from the past fourteen years
            would speak warmly about that heritage if asked, and would express
            the hope of being its inheritor. And yet, with honourable
            exceptions, the governments of the last fourteen years failed in
            this vocation. Failing systems remained unreformed, continuing to
            stifle Britain’s prosperity. Today Britain is ruled by a Labour
            Government that recognises this failure to build, and which has
            articulated high ambitions for changing this. But it remains
            doubtful that they will be any better at delivering on those
            ambitions than the Conservatives were.
          </p>
          <p>
            Constitutionally, British governments have immense power. How has a
            series of governments with both the will and the means to deliver
            systemic reform failed to do so? How can it be that the overwhelming
            experience reported by former ministers and advisors is one of
            disempowerment – of a ‘blob’ operating beyond their control, of
            pulling levers and nothing happening, of a vast dysfunctional
            machine slowly disintegrating on autopilot?
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that Britain’s political elites have failed because they
            do not understand the problems they are facing. No system can be
            fixed by people who do not know why it is broken. Like the elites of
            Austria-Hungary, Qing Dynasty China, or the Polish Commonwealth,
            they tinker ineffectually, mesmerised by the uncomprehended disaster
            rising up before them.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any government, Conservative or Labour, wishes to use its powers
            to improve the country, it needs to understand which of Britain’s
            institutions have failed, and why they have done so. Only then can
            they begin to develop a systematic programme of reform that will
            restore Britain’s economy to strength and its society to vitality.
            The alternative is continued drift, relative decline, political
            disenchantment, and a nation unable to meet the great challenges of
            our time. This essay is a first attempt at offering such a
            diagnosis.
          </p>
          <h3 id="falling-behind">Falling behind</h3>
          <p>
            Britain is a country of immense achievement. For most of modern
            history, its people were the richest, healthiest and best educated
            in the world. Its housing stock and its infrastructure was far more
            advanced than those of any of its rivals. It led the Scientific and
            Industrial Revolutions. Its institutions were almost uniquely
            liberal. Though British history contains its share of missteps and
            tragedies, there is probably nowhere else on earth that matches its
            achievements since the mid-eighteenth century, relative to its size
            and resource endowments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of these underlying strengths remain. The British people value
            debate and heterodoxy. They respect science, law and institutions.
            In hours of crisis, like the Russian invasion of Ukraine, they
            display unity and good sense. However inefficient and dysfunctional
            they may be, British institutions are strikingly incorruptible. One
            of the scandals of the decade is the alleged embezzlement of a
            campervan, an offence that would surely bring a contemptuous smile
            to the lips of a Putin or a Berlusconi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite these strengths, Britain is falling behind the developed
            world in economic dynamism. It led the world in the nineteenth
            century, and then Europe during the first half of the twentieth, but
            it lost its leadership after the Second World War. Since 2008, it
            has been clearly underperforming most of the developed world, even
            some of its more heavily taxed and regulated continental neighbours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most popular explanations for this are misguided. The Labour
            manifesto
            <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/kickstart-economic-growth/">blamed slow British growth on a lack of ‘strategy</a>’ from the Government, by which it means not enough targeted
            investment winner picking, and too much inequality. Some economists
            <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6da72060-cfd2-11e9-99a4-b5ded7a7fe3f">say that the UK’s economic model of private capital ownership is
              flawed</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8fcf263-8506-4b1c-aace-3d3d1743dc55">that limits on state capital expenditure are the fundamental
              problem</a>. They also point to more state spending as the solution, but
            ignore that this investment would face the same barriers and high
            costs that existing infrastructure projects face, and that deters
            private investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Others believe that our ageing society means permanently lower
            growth and higher taxes. Dietrich Vollrath’s book
            <em>Fully Grown: Why a Stagnant Economy is a Sign of Success</em>
            <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2020/02/26/slow-economic-growth-is-a-sign-of-success/">says that slower growth is an inevitable part of becoming
              services-driven</a>
            (and of birth rates declining). Another school of thought sees
            Britain’s 2010s performance as ‘one thing after another’, with a
            slow recovery from the financial crisis followed by Brexit, followed
            by Covid.
          </p>
          <p>
            But all of these explanations take the biggest obstacles to growth
            for granted. Our economy isn’t growing for the same reason that no
            more planes take off or land at Heathrow today than did twenty years
            ago: at some point it becomes impossible to grow when investment is
            banned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past two decades, Britain’s economy has needed a huge
            quantity of new housing, transport infrastructure and energy supply.
            Its postwar institutions have manifestly failed to deliver these.
            Britain is now a place in which it is far too hard to build houses
            and infrastructure, and where energy is too expensive. This has
            meant that our most productive industries have been starved of the
            resources, investment and talent – the economic foundations – that
            they need to grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The UK faces other challenges besides these. Our healthcare and
            higher education systems are so broken that politicians
            <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/how-the-government-is-handling-the-issue-of-immigration-in-the-uk">elected on a clear mandate to cut migration</a>
            instead let it rise to unprecedented levels to keep them afloat.
            Crime,
            <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2024">though it has been falling for years</a>, is substantially higher than it was in pre-Second World War
            Britain, despite a far older population. It is also significantly
            higher than in many other European countries including the
            Netherlands, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, and Italy.
            Childcare is so expensive that many families have fewer children,
            and later in life, than they would like. Our tax system is
            <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/mirrlees-review">riddled with distortions</a>
            and perverse incentives. There is no consensus about what our higher
            education system is supposed to do, who should benefit from it, and
            who should pay. And our political institutions are sclerotic: at
            best, many are unable to perform their most basic functions; at
            worst, they are a huge barrier to innovation and effective
            governance.
          </p>
          <p>
            But these other challenges do not explain why a huge economic gap
            opened up between us and other leading economies, since problems in
            immigration, crime, childcare, tax, and political institutions are
            also found in exactly the countries that have pulled away from
            Britain economically since 2008. Nor can austerity or the hangover
            from the financial crisis explain Britain’s malaise. The financial
            crisis was at least as turbulent in the United States as here. And
            austerity was at least as tough across Europe, which also had to
            fend with the euro crisis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Office for Budget Responsibility’s estimate of the impact of
            Brexit says
            <a href="https://obr.uk/forecasts-in-depth/the-economy-forecast/brexit-analysis/#assumptions">that it will knock four percent off long-run UK productivity</a>. This would be very painful, but still only a small fraction of
            the growth we have missed over the past fifteen years. (It also does
            not factor in the positive effect of avoiding destructive
            regulations like the EU Artificial Intelligence Act and Digital
            Markets Act.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Britain’s startling underperformance more recently is explained by
            the more basic factors this document focuses on: preventing
            investment into housing, infrastructure, and energy supply.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prosperity is intrinsically important. It gives people security and
            dignity, leisure and comfort, opportunity and economic freedom. It
            gives us freedom to pursue our other national goals: caring for
            older and less fortunate members of society, upholding a
            law-governed international order, preserving and enhancing our
            landscapes and townscapes, and leading the way in world-changing
            scientific research.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there is even more at stake here than that. We noted above the
            enduring strengths of the British social settlement –
            responsibility, autonomy, love of debate, respect for the
            individual. Economic failure saps confidence in these things. It
            begets dependency, resentment, defeatism, division and bitterness.
            It turns win-win relationships into zero-sum ones, where someone
            else must fail for you to succeed. Economic reform is not only the
            key to prosperity: it is the key to preserving and amplifying what
            is valuable about our society itself.

            A short history of British productivity
          </h4>
          <p>
            Britain’s biggest problem is its low productivity – that is, the
            value of the goods and services people produce per hour they work.

            Historically, this is exceptional. For most of modern history,
            Britain has been more productive than its peers, and when it has
            started to fall behind, it has successfully reformed itself to
            regain its advantage. Between the mid-eighteenth century and the
            late nineteenth century, Britain was the world’s leading economy.
            <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-decline-and-fall-of-britain/">Though it was overtaken by the United States by the beginning of
              the twentieth century</a>, it remained Europe&#39;s leading economy until the early 1950s,
            with the continent’s highest productivity and living standards, and
            its most advanced innovating firms.

            Privatisation, tax cuts, and the curbing of union power fixed
            important swathes of the UK economy. Crucially, they tackled chronic
            underinvestment in sectors that had been neglected under state
            ownership. Political incentives under state ownership encouraged
            underfunding – and where the Treasury did put money in, it tended to
            go on operational expenditures (e.g., unionised workers’ wages
            rather than capital investments). This problem has
            <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp9rxdrj713o">immediately reemerged</a>
            as the

            Between 1980 and 2008 Britain returned to its position as one of
            Europe’s most successful large economies. For the most part, Tony
            Blair’s governments were able to sustain these advances. In 2005
            Britain’s GDP per capita was
            <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank?tab=chart&amp;country=DEU~GBR">just 2.8 percent behind Germany’s, in purchasing power parity
              terms</a>, and fully
            <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/GBR/DEU">20 percent <em>higher</em></a>
            in US dollar terms, according to the World Bank. Penn World Tables,
            the other major source, have the UK <em>overtaking</em> Germany on
            GDP per capita in the mid-2000s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Britain’s relative success during this period is clearest when
            compared to other major economies. The chart below shows GDP per
            capita in France, Germany, Italy and the UK as a percentage of US
            GDP per capita. It shows Britain, after decades of relative
            stagnation, beginning to converge on the United States and overtake
            the other European countries from the early 1980s. Britain’s change
            of fortunes under Thatcher, and continued improvement under Blair,
            is clear.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But crucial parts of the economy were still left unfixed – notably
            land-use planning policy,
            <a href="https://conservativehome.com/2021/05/14/ben-southwood-why-planning-reform-may-work-this-time-round-delivering-us-the-new-homes-that-we-need/">which Thatcher’s Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley had tried
              and failed to reform</a>, and which Tony Blair’s government was unable to make a dent in
            either.
          </p>
          <p>
            This left Britain with latent weaknesses that have become hugely
            problematic over the last quarter of a century. Since the 1990s,
            Britain has experienced rapid population growth, after decades of
            demographic stability, and big shifts in prosperity from some parts
            of the country to others. The decision to transition away from
            fossil fuels has created the need for huge quantities of new energy
            infrastructure, recently exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, but by
            no means beginning then. Across the developed world, great
            metropolitan agglomerations have become even more economically
            important. London has been among the biggest winners from this
            trend, in spite of the obstacles in its way.
          </p>
          <p>
            What Britain needed in the last 25 years above all was a huge amount
            of building – of homes, energy supply, and transport infrastructure.
            Without it, Britain has fallen behind, weighed down by a development
            system that
            <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/britains-forgotten-financial-crisis/">worked badly even in the 1950s and 60s</a>, and that is positively disastrous today.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            That gap continues to grow. Between 2010 and 2019, worker
            productivity grew by eight percent in the United States, 9.6 percent
            in France and just 5.8 percent in Britain. And those countries’
            growth rates pale in comparison to that of Poland, which has grown
            its productivity by 29.7 percent between 2010 and 2019, and on
            current trends will overtake Britain by the end of this decade.
          </p>
          <p>
            To put the shortfall since 2008 into perspective, if Britain had
            grown in line with its trend between 1979 and 2008, it would be 24.8
            percent more productive today. Assuming we continued working the
            same hours annually, that would mean a GDP per capita of £41,800
            instead of £33,500, making the typical family about £8,700 better
            off before taxes and transfers. Tax revenues would be £1,282 billion
            instead of £1,027 billion, assuming tax rates are held constant.
            That would mean that, instead of a deficit of £85 billion, on
            current spending we would have a surplus of £170 billion, meaning
            that taxes could be much lower, and public services could be better
            funded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though these figures may seem improbably high, they are not out of
            line with the world’s richest economies, and there is no reason
            Britain should not aim to sit among them as it once did. This essay
            argues that Britain can do so by adopting a programme of reform
            similar in its scale of ambition to that of the programme of
            liberalisation in the 1980s. Where earlier reforms were focused on
            cutting taxes, curbing the power of the trade unions, and
            privatising state-run industries, this time we must focus on making
            it easier to invest in homes, labs, railways, roads, bridges,
            interconnectors, and nuclear reactors.

            France is notoriously heavily regulated and dominated by labour
            unions. In 2023, the country was brought to a standstill by strikes
            against proposals to raise the age of retirement from 62 to 64.
            French workers have been known to strike by
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/26/3m-france-boss-kidnapping">kidnapping</a>

            – a practice that the public there
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090411043129/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/blog/europeinsight/archives/2009/04/sarkozys_bossna.html">reportedly supports</a>
            – and strikes are so common that French unions have designed special
            barbecues that fit in tram tracks so they can grill sausages while
            they march.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            France is notoriously heavily taxed. Factoring in
            <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLE_III2">employer-side taxes</a>
            in addition to those the employee actually sees, a French company
            <a href="https://x.com/s8mb/status/1742980931051479522">would have to spend €137,822</a>
            on wages and employer-side taxes for a worker to earn a nominal
            salary of €100,000, from which they would take home €61,041. For a
            British worker to take home the same amount after tax (£52,715,
            equivalent to €61,041), a British employer would only have to spend
            €97,765.33 (£84,435.6) on wages and employer-side taxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet, despite these high taxes, onerous regulations, and powerful
            unions, French workers are significantly more productive than
            British ones – closer to Americans than to us. France’s GDP per
            capita is only about the same as the UK’s because French workers
            take more time off on holiday and work shorter hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            What can explain France’s prosperity in spite of its high taxes and
            high business regulations? France can afford such a large,
            interventionist state because it does a good job building the things
            that Britain blocks: <strong>housing</strong>,
            <strong>infrastructure</strong> and <strong>energy supply</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Housing supply is vastly freer in France. Overall, it now has about
            seven million more homes than Britain (<a href="https://www.insee.fr/en/statistiques/5009609">37 million</a>
            versus
            <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/researchoutputssubnationaldwellingstockbytenureestimatesengland2012to2015/2020">30 million</a>), with the same number of people. Those homes are newer, and are
            more concentrated in the places people want to live: its prosperous
            cities and holiday regions.

            France has allowed its other great cities to grow and flourish too,

            Transport infrastructure is now better there: there are seven
            British tram networks, versus 29 in France. Six French cities have
            underground metro systems, against three in Britain. Since 1980,
            France has opened 1,740 miles of high speed rail, compared to just
            67 miles in Britain. France has nearly 12,000 kilometres of
            motorways versus around 4,000 kilometres here – and French motorways
            tend to be smoother and better kept (and three quarters are tolled,
            making congestion much less of a problem). In the last 25 years
            alone,

            Energy is more abundant and, thanks to the country’s nuclear
            roll-out from the 1970s, the country has already done a lot of

            Because France gets these big things right, it can afford to get a
            lot of other things wrong. If Britain could catch up with France on
            housing, infrastructure and energy, without making the sort of
            mistakes it makes on regulation and tax, the implication is that we
            could be far richer than they are, as we were for centuries before
            the 1950s.

            Britain gets many of the important things for prosperity right.
            Businesses from around the world come here to draw on our legal
            regime, low levels of corruption, centuries-old commitment to free
            trade, efficient financial sector, and world-leading scientific
            research ecosystem. Our time zone allows us to talk to Asia, Africa,
            and the Americas all in one day, and everyone here is fluent in the
            modern world’s
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Lingua_Franca"><em>lingua franca</em></a>. As the economist Tyler Cowen said, England remains ‘<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1e6d106c-8462-4691-9c4b-eb57afec9907">one of the few places where you can really birth and execute a
              new idea</a>’. This is unbelievably precious, rare, and difficult to create.
          </p>
          <p>
            But we fail to capitalise on these rare advantages because the
            economy lacks the most important foundations: private investment is
            blocked from going where it could generate the highest returns,
            meaning we have lower investment than all our peer economies; in
            particular we do not allow investment in the infrastructure we need
            to allow people to access prosperous areas, the houses they need to
            live there, and the offices, labs, factories, and warehouses they
            need to work there, which, together with our high and rising energy
            costs, stop the companies in those cities reaching their full
            potential.

            Britain’s best chance of achieving rapid economic growth in the near

            that is, greater clustering of economic activity in productive
            places – and lower <strong>energy costs</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            These economic foundations are important determinants of how
            productive workers and businesses are.

            No individual by themselves can create much value, no matter how
            gifted or hardworking they might be. They need to combine their
            efforts with machinery and other people to really succeed.
            Investment rates determine the amount and quality of the tools they
            can use; energy costs determine how they can use them; and
            agglomeration – including both housing and infrastructure –
            determines who they can use them with.

            These policies are a complement to Britain’s most advanced frontier
            sectors. More agglomeration drives higher rates of innovation, and
            increases the choices that businesses have about who to hire. Lower
            energy costs make certain high-tech sectors more viable, such as
            advanced manufacturing and AI training. Higher rates of investment
            into businesses make it easier for smaller companies to rapidly
            scale up into giants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rapid economic growth is possible for Britain. Because what we get
            wrong is so mundane and straightforward, fixing these problems would
            allow Britain to experience similar rapid
            <a href="https://www.sambowman.co/p/britain-is-a-developing-country">‘catch-up’ growth</a>
            that countries like South Korea, Estonia, and Poland have
            experienced over the past thirty years.

          <h3 id="investment">Investment</h3>
          <p>
            Investment is when we forgo resources that we would consume today,
            and instead use them to produce more resources in the future. It is
            the life-blood of economic growth, and of individual businesses’
            successes. Investment is not just what happens after we build
            sufficient roads, houses, pylons, and power plants: building those
            things <em>is</em> investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is good about building these things is not that they cost
            money, and what matters is not how much money we spend on
            investment. It is the things we actually produce, and the benefits
            they give us, that are valuable: the easier and less expensive it is
            to build them, the higher the return we get for a given amount of
            money invested, and the better it is to spend money on them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Britain does invest at a lower rate than most other advanced
            countries. In 2022, France spent (across both public bodies and
            private companies) 26 percent of its GDP on physical capital
            investment; Germany 25 percent; OECD members 23 percent on average;
            the United Kingdom just 19 percent. The total capital stock of the
            UK is actually lower now than it was in 2016; by comparison, it is
            14 percent higher on average across the rest of the G7.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important reason for this is not that we are inherently
            penny-pinching and short-termist, where Americans and Europeans are
            not. It is that we have banned most of the most productive
            investments we could make, made it eye-wateringly expensive to do
            the ones we do allow ourselves to make, and allowed many
            publicly-managed assets to be neglected.

            These problems have been present for more than half a century. In
            the postwar decades, the British state chronically failed to invest
            in the various companies it had nationalised, succumbing to the
            permanent temptation of politicians to allocate resources to
            frontline services (i.e. immediate consumption) rather than
            investing for the long term. We see this every year with the NHS,
            whose operational budget continues to rise, but
            <a href="https://inthesightoftheunwise.substack.com/p/episode-twenty-two-the-big-nhs-problem">which has the fewest MRI and CT scanners of any developed
              country’s healthcare system, and by far the least machinery and

            overall.

            between London and Manchester as did private franchises by the 2010s
            – overall passenger numbers fell steadily between nationalisation in
            1948 and privatisation in 1994,
            <a href="https://x.com/s8mb/status/1783395040296866199">after which point they have more than doubled</a>. Many state-run British industries became efficient in terms of
            economising on the scarce resources they were allowed, but extremely
            inefficient in terms of overall productivity.

            The privatisations of British Steel, British Airways, British Gas,
            British Telecoms and many other nationalised companies in the 1980s
            and 90s thus opened up great opportunities. From 1981 to 1990,
            British capital investment
            <a href="https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?tm=gross%20fixed%20capital%20formation&amp;pg=0&amp;snb=74&amp;vw=tb&amp;df%5Bds%5D=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&amp;df%5Bid%5D=DSD_NAMAIN10%40DF_TABLE1_EXPENDITURE_CPC&amp;df%5Bag%5D=OECD.SDD.NAD&amp;df%5Bvs%5D=1.0&amp;dq=A.AUS%2BAUT%2BBEL%2BCAN%2BCHL%2BCOL%2BCRI%2BCZE%2BDNK%2BEST%2BFIN%2BFRA%2BDEU%2BGRC%2BHUN%2BISL%2BIRL%2BISR%2BITA%2BJPN%2BKOR%2BLVA%2BLTU%2BLUX%2BMEX%2BNLD%2BNZL%2BNOR%2BPOL%2BPRT%2BSVK%2BSVN%2BESP%2BSWE%2BCHE%2BTUR%2BGBR%2BUSA.S1..P51G.N11G......&amp;pd=1981%2C1990&amp;to%5BTIME_PERIOD%5D=false">grew faster than any other country in the OECD</a>
            barring booming Japan and tiny Luxembourg. Contrary to what is
            sometimes claimed, North Sea oil and gas was not the biggest part of
            this, with investment in it
            <a href="https://www.escoe.ac.uk/research/historical-data/national-accounts-2/">actually falling over this period</a>. Investment levels rose chiefly because state mismanagement had
            left so many opportunities untaken in the preceding decades –
            opportunities that privatisation opened up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Underinvestment leads to particularly acute problems in places like
            the North of England that have historically prospered from
            capital-intensive industries. These areas have the same underlying
            features that generate industrial heartlands elsewhere, like in
            Germany and Sweden: relatively cheap land, proximity to waterways,
            roads and rail networks, and – unlike many other parts of Britain –
            cheap, abundant housing. But expensive energy and the difficulty of
            building new premises, warehouses, factories, pipelines, pylons,
            distribution centres, and so on holds them back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of this underinvestment is due to
            <a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/full-expensing-the-best-idea-in-politics-youve-never-heard-of">distortions in the tax code</a>
            that penalise capital investments. Prior to the introduction of full
            expensing, British businesses that invested in machinery, buildings
            and acquired patents
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/the-super-deduction">could only claim back 62 percent</a>
            of the costs from their corporation tax bill (compared to 100
            percent for operating expenses like rent or wages), which meant that
            despite the UK having a low headline rate of corporation tax, the
            effective rate on profits generated via physical investments was
            still high. The introduction of full expensing has corrected this
            for some investments, but still does not apply to buildings or
            machinery with an expected lifespan of over twenty-five years.
            Business rates, meanwhile,
            <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/abadf956-dca6-11e5-8541-00fb33bdf038">have the effect of increasing the tax liability when most
              property enhancements are made</a>, regardless of when or if they become profitable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the underinvestment is due to higher input costs, such as
            the high cost of energy, discussed later. This is most acutely a
            problem for the manufacturing sector, where high energy costs have
            made many industries unviable in Britain, while they thrive in other
            advanced economies.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the most important reason Britain sees underinvestment today is
            that the state bans the very investments that would be most
            valuable. If allowed, private investors would be rushing to build
            housing, transport infrastructure and energy infrastructure.

            were originally built this way. If done today, this would show up as
            enormous amounts of capital investment in the national accounts. But
            as we will show, building these things is prohibited in the vast
            majority of cases in which it would be economically rational. If we
            change that, Britain would see an enormous construction boom as
            suppressed demand for these things was met, and the resulting
            capital assets would continue contributing to the economy
            indefinitely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Improving the UK’s investment rate would bring great benefits:
            <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Restarting-Future-How-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691211582">about half the shortfall in productivity growth since the
              financial crisis can be attributed to underinvestment in
              (tangible) capital</a>, while much of the rest is likely to be due to the shortfall in
            intangible investments like R&amp;D.
          </p>
          <p>
            Investment is what makes us richer over time. Any successful
            economic plan will have to unleash it in order to succeed. But even
            as the need for higher investment becomes more widely accepted by
            Britain’s economic commentators, they tend to propose more quangos
            and subsidies to tackle the problem, because they miss two crucial
            points.
          </p>
          <p>
            First: private investment is far more significant than government
            investment. Public investment can be extremely important, especially
            in areas that have large spillovers to the broad economy, but which
            do not always generate a private return. But more than 80 percent of
            investment in the UK and most other developed countries is done by
            the private sector. Public investment was 18.0 percent of the UK
            total in 2021, 17.6 percent in 2020, and 15.5 percent in 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            And second: apart from taxes on investment like corporation tax and
            capital gains tax, higher investment in the UK is mainly frustrated
            by systems that effectively ban private companies from doing it
            (like building houses, infrastructure, and energy generation),
            rather than being down to short-sightedness by these businesses, or
            a lack of generosity by government.
          </p>
          <p>
            Commentators have searched far and wide for explanations of
            Britain’s investment problem. But the explanation was before our
            eyes all along. Buildings, energy and transport infrastructure are
            the investments that Britain most needs, and they are largely
            banned. In banning them, we have generated higher costs for a range
            of other investments too. There is no need to posit esoteric
            cultural problems among British businesspeople, no need for a dozen
            more government strategies, deals and consultations. We don’t need
            to pay businesses to invest more. We just need to stop banning them
            from doing so.

            For centuries, Britain had a development control system that
            supported urban growth in the places with the most successful
            industries, as well as building beautiful cities that we treasure
            today. Since 1947, however, Britain has had probably the most
            restrictive development control system in the world. This has held
            back our strongest sectors and businesses and stopped people from
            moving to the places with the best jobs. On its own, we see it as
            the largest cause of British stagnation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout Britain’s history, its economic centre of gravity has
            changed, sometimes profoundly. During the 1800s, millions of people
            migrated to the cities of the Midlands, Wales, and especially the
            North of England, where the Industrial Revolution was
            revolutionising the world economy. Cardiff grew by around 1,000
            percent in 45 years as people moved near the coal that enabled heavy
            industry. Manchester grew from 90,000 in 1800 to 700,000 in 1900, in
            part due to the soft water that enabled Lancashire’s world-beating
            cotton textiles. Liverpool grew by over 1,000 percent between 1800
            and the 1930s.
          </p>
          <p>
            This process continued in the 1930s, but as different industries
            came to the fore, different locations were predominant. Cities like
            Birmingham, Coventry, London, Leicester, and Nottingham expanded at
            breakneck pace as the link with raw materials was broken, and jobs
            shifted to offices and factories in the South and Midlands. Immense
            suburbs sprang up, with their characteristic long gardens and
            semi-detached houses. Private companies and local councils laid out
            a vast system of commuter rail, electric trams and motorbuses that
            enabled and served these new neighbourhoods. The English housing
            stock
            <a href="https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/English_housing_stock_age">nearly doubled in twenty years</a>, transforming the living standards of the English people.

            As late as the 1930s, there were almost no restrictions on
            development, other than generous height limits in some cities (about
            ten storeys) and some building safety regulations. Subject to those,
            any property owner
            <a href="https://capx.co/solving-the-planning-problem/">could build virtually anything they wanted</a>. After 1909, developers did have to get permission to develop, but
            councils almost always gave it, since they had to compensate
            landowners for the lost value if they rejected permissions, and
            councils were themselves generously compensated through local
            property taxes if they accepted development.
          </p>
          <p>
            In sum, before the 1940s, British cities grew as their industries
            did. People moved, in their millions, around the country. People
            moved to places where wages were higher, raising wage competition
            for workers in the places that they left. This meant that there were
            fewer and narrower persistent income differences between places than
            those we see today. Liberal development policy generated a country
            with a natural force pushing against persistent, entrenched regional
            inequality,
            <a href="https://www.bensouthwood.co.uk/p/regional-inequality-also-a-housing">which was narrowing in the decades to the 1940s and has been
              widening since</a>.
          </p>
          <h4 id="the-source-of-the-problem">The source of the problem</h4>
          <p>
            In 1947, the Town and Country Planning Act (TCPA) was introduced,
            part of the postwar reform programme that nationalised nearly every
            major industry, from
            <a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/steel-nationalized">steel</a>
            to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Act_1947">man-with-van road haulage companies</a>, and normalised top tax rates at over 90 percent. The TCPA
            completely removed most of the incentive for councils to give
            planning permissions by removing their obligation to compensate
            those whose development rights they restricted. Other reforms at
            around the same time also redistributed away much of the upside that
            councils had received from development through local property taxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The law also added a requirement to get permission from
            <em>national government</em> for any development, and to pay to the
            national government a tax of 100 percent on any value that resulted
            from permission being granted. Most notoriously, the TCPA instituted
            the legal powers that were used to create and expand green belts the
            following decade, prohibiting development on large rings of land
            around England’s cities.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-source-1">1</a></sup>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Overall, it moved Britain from a system where almost any development
            was permitted anywhere, to one where development was nearly always
            prohibited. Despite some minor later liberalisations, like the
            introduction of permitted development rights in the 1980s, the
            underlying problem remains. Since the TCPA was introduced in 1947,
            private housebuilding has never reached Victorian levels, let alone
            the record progress achieved just before the Second World War.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, local authorities still have robust powers to reject new
            developments, and little incentive to accept them. Historically,
            local governments encouraged development because their tax bases
            grew in line with the extra value created, but this incentive has
            been
            <a href="https://www.sambowman.co/p/one-weird-trick-to-get-data-centres">eroded by successive reforms that have centralised and capped
              local governments’ tax-raising powers</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            National governments have not been blind to the fact that
            development is not happening. Their solution to the problem has
            generally been
            <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-britain-doesnt-build/">to try to force local governments to permit the homes the country
              needs</a>
            (and take the political flak that engenders) through targets and
            punishments. But this system has never managed to raise building
            rates by anywhere near enough to return prices to the downward trend
            they were on for hundreds of years until 1938.
          </p>
          <p>
            Attempting to force local governments to build more homes has
            repeatedly backfired, and where it has delivered new homes they have
            often been
            <a href="https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/26348/">low quality and far from where the highest demand for homes is</a>, since the targets are calculated with almost no reference to
            actual demand for new houses. There is little reason to think the
            new government’s plans will be very different, and
            <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/labour-needs-to-build-homes-where-people-want-to-live-zv6vlk53f">its decision to lower London’s target as a ‘reward’ for failing
              to meet its previous targets</a>
            is a sign that it, too, will fail to build homes where they are
            needed most.
          </p>
          <p>
            Local people bear many of the costs of new development – disruption,
            congestion, and competition over access to state-provided services
            like healthcare and education. At the same time, they gain few or
            none of the benefits, the obvious exception being those local
            landowners who actually receive the planning permissions. It is thus
            unsurprising that local people tend to be
            <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09516298211044852">fierce opponents of development</a>. When the national government has tried to take away their right
            to control development nearby, they have resisted vigorously,
            <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/government-ditches-mutant-housing-formula-23176334">usually succeeding in having the targets revoked or watered
              down</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This has contributed to a climate that is supportive of continual
            increases in regulations at the national level, which add process
            and cost to development. Recently, this has meant compulsory
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/against-banning-buildings-with-just">second staircase requirements</a>, which ban apartment blocks with only one staircase and lift core
            – the standard type in nearly every country in the developed world.
            (The Government’s own impact assessment of the second staircase
            rules determined that
            <a href="https://x.com/s8mb/status/1775116154291224839">their costs would be more than two hundred times greater than
              their benefits</a>.) It has also meant reducing the sizes of windows: it is now
            legally difficult to build windows
            <a href="https://x.com/SCP_Hughes/status/1674006804076920834">as large as those common in Georgian and Victorian buildings</a>, apparently because they cause overheating in hot weather, and
            because people might supposedly fall out of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same climate has facilitated rules requiring every development
            to prove ‘nutrient neutrality’, to survey for protected species like
            newts and bats (even
            <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a080c618-c250-45cf-9728-8ec8ddd0a56c">in places where their presence has never been detected</a>), and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            High housing costs also create the demand for destructive policies
            that appear to alleviate the proximate problems of expensive housing
            without dealing with the underlying issue. In many cases today, as
            many of 40 percent of a new development’s homes must be subsidised
            for ‘affordable’ renters instead of being made available at market
            rates. These requirements function as a tax on new housing (and so
            local objectors often support them), redistributing income from
            every other private tenant to a lucky few. Countries with expensive
            rental housing also see movements for rent controls, and punitive
            rental regulations, like giving every tenant the permanent right to
            live in the property they occupy.

            The economic effects of housing shortages
          </h4>
          <p>
            Since the introduction of the British planning system in 1947,
            <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-britain-doesnt-build/">there has been very little increase in housing supply when better
              jobs make an area more desirable</a>. Instead of extra homes being built, workers competing for scarce
            housing
            <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/agglomeration-benefits-are-here-to">are forced to bid up the price of existing homes</a>. This means that many of the income gains go to existing landlords
            and landowners, and that many people cannot move to better jobs at
            all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because only the best paid people can afford to move to the most
            prosperous cities,
            <a href="https://www.bensouthwood.co.uk/p/regional-inequality-also-a-housing">there is no longer general migration across the economic
              spectrum</a>, as there was in the nineteenth century when it was
            <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/productivity-and-migration-new-insights-19th-century#:~:text=From%20brief%20inspection%2C%20it%20is,concentrated%20in%20low%2Dskilled%20jobs.">the <em>poorest</em> people who were most likely to move to find
              better work</a>. Today, this has created a situation where only the most gifted
            and educated people can afford to move to richer cities and stay
            there. Their less well-off peers are quite literally ‘left behind’,
            and compete with one another over a narrow pool of jobs, driving the
            wages down even further, making those places feel even more
            deprived.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, social housing anchors many people to extremely
            central, high-value areas in our major cities. A staggering amount
            of central London’s housing is socially rented:
            <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth/housing/tenure-of-household/hh-tenure-5a/rented-social-rented">40.2 percent of Islington households</a>
            are on subsidised social rents; as are 33.7 percent of Camden’s;
            35.9 percent of those in Tower Hamlets; and 39.7 percent of
            Southwark’s. These households occupy some of the most valuable space
            in the country, and are trapped in their tenancies, remaining even
            when their homes, often damp, poorly insulated, and altogether
            dilapidated, are no longer fit for their changing circumstances,
            because they will likely end up in a less valuable, less
            centrally-located property if they try to move.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result is a ‘missing middle’ in cities like London, where only
            the very well-off and very badly-off can afford to live there,
            excluding lower- and middle-income people from elsewhere in the
            country. Even many higher earners cannot afford to live anywhere
            near the centre once they have children. The impoverishment of
            coastal and post-industrial towns cannot be understood without
            looking at housing shortages in more prosperous parts of the
            country: both are the products of Britain’s planning system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the supply of homes in successful cities is tightly
            constrained, the growth of our most successful companies and sectors
            within those cities is constrained as well. Even the people who do
            get to live in high-productivity places are less productive than
            they could be, since their employers are less able to hire mid- and
            lower-skilled people to support them in the workplace. It is
            inconceivable that Britain could have had the Industrial Revolution
            if it had banned workers from moving to the coalfields of South
            Wales and Yorkshire and the textile factories of Lancashire. It is
            not an exaggeration to say that Britain could be forgoing its role
            in another industrial revolution today – that of artificial
            intelligence, biotech, and related technologies – by making the
            corresponding mistake.

            Britain is not the only country that has slowed its growth through
            holding back agglomeration. Parts of America have seen similar
            shortages. Economists Gilles Duranton and Diego Puga
            <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26591">judge that</a> if the
            whole of New York City allowed the densities that were common in
            Georgian and Victorian London, rents and house prices would fall
            towards construction costs, and the metropolitan area would at least
            double in population, to over 40 million people. Similar things
            would happen to the Bay Area, Boston, Los Angeles, and other US
            ‘superstar’ cities if higher densities were allowed. Duranton and
            Puga argue that huge economic growth would result from allowing
            these superstar cities to build more.

            The fundamental issue is that British cities are not allowed to
            expand upwards <em>or</em> outwards, whereas most American cities,
            like those of France, Italy and Germany, have at least been able to
            sprawl. Under the liberal system of the nineteenth century, late
            twentieth century Cambridge’s huge success in life sciences would
            have led to both taller buildings and many new suburbs, connected by
            new train lines, trams, tubes, and roads. It would likely have a
            population of at least a million today, just as Glasgow grew from a
            population of 70,000 in 1800 to over 700,000 in 1900 to facilitate
            its world-leading shipbuilding industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, nearly all of the potential is blocked. Scarce property means
            people cannot move to take up the job opportunities on offer. Some
            businesses never start. Others are not as productive as
            international competitors. Others fail to scale up to become
            unicorns or bigger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cambridge is not alone. Many of our smaller but richer cities and
            towns, places like Oxford or York, cannot grow up or out. The people
            who might have lived there, earning £600 or £700 a week, instead
            live in more deprived areas, earning £400. The same is true of
            London. It is hard to build new housing or office space, making it
            hard for businesses to expand, and hard for workers to move to these
            places to take up good jobs.

            The postwar housing system has underdelivered since the 1950s: the
            enormous improvements in housing affordability in the Victorian and
            Edwardian eras stalled as soon as the new system was introduced. The
            problem became ever more severe each decade, even before the
            population began to rise rapidly: average private home sizes
            actually got <em>smaller</em> during the 1960s and 1970s. But the
            problem has escalated into a disaster in the last few decades, as
            massive net immigration, an ageing population, and unforeseen
            economic change have together led to huge unmet housing demand in
            the South. The social challenges that accompany high levels of
            immigration have been hugely amplified by the persistent lack of
            planning reform.
          </p>
          <p>

            From the eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries, Britain had
            easily the best transport infrastructure in the world. In the
            eighteenth century, a total of
            <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Economic-History-of-Transport-in-Britain/Savage-Barker/p/book/9780415512374?srsltid=AfmBOopr7hzFO54JklMfdHkVMSYpuXv4voHUa39zU63tOxiuIAYBI5bh">1,116 private companies built and renewed 22,000 miles</a>
            of tolled roads, while other companies dug 4,000 miles of canals.
            The result was by far the best transport system in Europe. In the
            nineteenth century, Britain built a system of railways that is still
            impressive today, despite having hardly been added to since 1914 (in
            fact,
            <a href="https://preview.redd.it/r0ypgwbv6ri31.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=637b6bc1d04a19acea33a6ad6aab45af81b4db88">we have half as many miles of railway today than we did then</a>). London had an extensive underground railway system in the 1860s,
            almost four decades before the first underground metro line anywhere
            else in the world. In fact, the word ‘metro’ for underground
            railways comes from the Metropolitan Line, the world’s first.
          </p>
          <p>
            In little more than a decade around 1900, private entrepreneurs
            built five more underground lines totalling hundreds of kilometres,
            still at no cost to the taxpayer. Ninety British municipalities laid
            electric tram networks in less than twenty years, including Europe’s
            longest (in London), while private companies created a gigantic
            fleet of motor buses. This superb transport system was one of the
            conditions of Britain’s revolutionary economic expansion, and of
            London’s position as the foremost city and unquestioned economic
            capital of the globe.

          <p>
            Although Britain’s historic infrastructure was largely delivered by
            the private sector (and to a lesser extent by local councils), the
            state did have a role. Delivering national infrastructure is
            extremely difficult without compulsory purchase powers: if every
            property owner on the route of a railway can play holdout, it is
            extremely unlikely to be practicable to buy them all out
            voluntarily. Until the 1940s, these powers were created through
            private Acts of Parliament: a select committee considered requests
            for compulsory purchase powers from the project’s promoters, and if
            they believed the project was in the national interest,
            <a href="https://x.com/bswud/status/1717510189744583130">they created an <em>ad hoc</em> law giving the promoters the
              powers they needed to make it happen</a>. This system was extraordinarily swift and inexpensive: the
            planning process for major national projects generally took months.

            By contrast, today’s system is broken. For a whole range of
            infrastructure – railways, trams, nuclear power, and more – building
            has become vastly more expensive than competitors across Europe and
            East Asia. The consenting of major projects usually takes years, and
            sometimes decades. A suite of reforms in 2008
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/the-solar-cliff-edge">seems to have produced only moderate improvements, many of which
              have since been lost</a>. A key national strength has become a key national weakness.

          <p>
            On a per-mile basis, Britain now faces some of the highest railway
            costs in the world. These costs push numerous potential schemes into
            financial unviability – schemes that would have prospered in the
            past, and that would prosper in other countries today. High
            construction costs are effectively precluding a rail transport boom
            such as Britain enjoyed in the nineteenth century, or France is
            enjoying today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if it had only cost as much as planned in 2013, HS2 would have
            been between two and four times more expensive than high speed rail
            lines in Italy and France. In fact it cost a lot more: the section
            we end up building will be between four and eight times more
            expensive per mile than French or Italian high speed rail projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            At £18.1 billion for the tunnelled Paddington to Stratford section,
            the Elizabeth Line (Crossrail) was the second most expensive metro
            line ever built, at £1.4 billion per mile. By comparison, Madrid
            <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/subway-lessons-from-madrid">built</a>
            a 120-mile new underground network in twelve years (with much of the
            network open after just four years) for
            <a href="https://tunnelbuilder.com/metrosur/edition2pdf/page2.pdf">£68 million per mile</a>
            – twenty times cheaper than Crossrail and nine times cheaper than
            the Jubilee line extension built around the same time. Copenhagen
            built a 9.6 mile underground line in 2019 at a total cost of £3.4
            billion or £350 million per mile (four times cheaper). Crossrail 2
            (if it is ever built) is expected to cost even more than the
            Elizabeth Line did per mile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite its astonishing construction cost, the Elizabeth Line is so
            valuable to London that it is probably <em>still</em> good value for
            money. But if construction costs were more moderate, dozens of other
            rail schemes would be good value for money too.

          <p>
            Britain has also lagged behind on electrification, one of the most
            important transformations in modern railway technology. Electrified
            railways are
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/infrastructure-costs-electrification">simply better</a>
            - they allow trains to accelerate faster and reach higher speeds.
            Electric trains require at least five times less maintenance and
            suffer fewer breakdowns compared to diesel trains, driving huge
            gains in reliability. These lower maintenance costs, combined with
            the fact that expensive diesel isn’t needed to power the trains,
            means that electrification often saves money in the long run.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 1890s, electrification rapidly transformed intra-city rail
            transport. In London alone, the Northern, Piccadilly, Bakerloo,
            Central and Waterloo &amp; City Lines were opened between 1890 and
            1906, transforming urban mobility and galvanising a wave of suburban
            expansion. But although intercity electrification has been possible
            for many decades, it has been adopted painfully slowly. Just 38
            percent of British railways are electrified, compared to 71 percent
            of railways in Italy, 61 percent in Germany, and 55 percent in
            France. India recently
            <a href="https://x.com/GTCarfree/status/1745861787600531837">electrified hundreds of thousands of kilometres of its network in
              just ten years</a>
            – it is now 94 percent electrified. Once more, the key constraint is
            cost: British per mile electrification costs are
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/infrastructure-costs-electrification">more than double</a>
            those of Germany or Denmark.<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-source-5">5</a></sup>

          <h4 id="tramways">Tramways</h4>
          <p>
            Trams are potentially a far cheaper way of doing mass transit than
            underground railways. In the early twentieth century, some
            <a href="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/britainremade/pages/1451/attachments/original/1723813389/BRM7607_Tram_Report_Digital-Single-Pages_AWK.pdf?1723813389">two hundred</a>
            British towns and cities had trams: an immense network that flowered
            between 1890 and the 1950s, enabling urban expansion, economic
            growth and higher living standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to their efficiency on heavily travelled routes, many countries
            are now renewing and reopening tram lines. The outstanding case is
            France, which has built 21 tramways in recent decades. Britain has
            begun to make efforts to do the same, but
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/britains-infrastructure-is-too-expensive">Britain&#39;s tram projects are 2.5 times more expensive than
              French projects per mile</a>, hamstringing the renaissance of the tram in this country. There
            are now French cities of 150,000 people with fast modern tram
            systems - towns comparable in size to Carlisle or Lincoln. It is
            inconceivable that cities of this size could get tramways in England
            at current build costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            This has led to some profoundly dissatisfying outcomes. Leeds is now
            the largest city in Europe without a metro system: there are about
            830,000 people in the official greater Leeds area,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPON_metropolitan_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom">2.3 million in the broader metropolitan area</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.tomforth.co.uk/circlepopulations/">2.6 million within 50 kilometres</a>, the same as Munich. Munich has an 11.4 kilometre tunnel in the
            centre of the city allowing it to turn its seven commuter railways
            into Crossrails, plus eight <em>underground</em> metro lines with
            around 100 stations, totalling more than 100 kilometres in length.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1993, the John Major government
            <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/1993/15/pdfs/ukla_19930015_en.pdf">granted all the necessary powers to build a Leeds ‘Supertram’</a>. But it would have cost £1 billion (£1.6 billion in 2023 prices),
            on a per-mile basis twice the cost of the average French tramway.
            This is a key reason why it hasn’t been built in the 31 years since.
            It’s an especially ironic failure given that a daring private
            company opened Europe’s first overhead-powered tram network in Leeds
            in 1891 – a wildly successful project that was subsequently emulated
            in every major city.

            Why is infrastructure so expensive in Britain?
          </h4>
          <p>
            There are a range of proximate causes for Britain’s high
            infrastructure costs. Some of them are unalterable: for example,
            Britain was the first place to install below-street utilities, so we
            don’t have a very good idea of the pipes hidden under our feet, and
            tunnelling through soft London clay can perversely be more difficult
            than through hard Norwegian rock. But many of the key factors have
            appeared during the last two to three decades, the period during
            which infrastructure costs have exploded.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We gold plate designs, spending extra billions on features that
              don’t enhance functionality, as with the award-winning Jubilee
              Line stations, or the plan for HS2 to run
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail">60 kilometres per hour faster than is typical for European
                high-speed rail</a>. Older infrastructure systems like the Victoria Line, the DLR or
              the Croydon Tramlink made do with simple repeated station designs,
              which hugely reduced their cost: the same tends to be true with
              Continental transport infrastructure today.

              We often redesign projects multiple times in response to
              successive waves of ‘stakeholder’ interventions. Successful
              projects manage this by empowering specialists to make engineering
              and design decisions on the fly.
              <a href="https://progressireland.org/to-save-up-to-e15-2bn-on-metrolink-the-state-needs-to-upgrade-tii/">Unsuccessful projects use generalists or consultants who have

              Instead of a steady pipeline of projects, we have a ‘<a href="https://www.frpadvisory.com/blog/building-futures-whats-next-for-uk-infrastructure/">feast and famine</a>’ approach. Germany electrifies roughly 200 kilometres of track
              every year, while Britain oscillates between electrifying
              <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/infrastructure-costs-electrification">0 and up to 900</a>. This inconsistency prevents businesses from investing in
              equipment and training construction workers, and stops civil
              servants developing expertise about efficiently running these
              projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              All these problems lead to high borrowing costs for the
              engineering companies contracted to deliver the projects, because
              of the risks they incur (e.g.
              <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/109297/pdf/">two thirds of the cost of Hinkley Point C is financing the
                project</a>).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Analysis of the failures of British infrastructure delivery tends to
            stop here. But we believe that these proximate causes largely arise
            from a common source, which is the excessive centralisation of
            funding and consenting of infrastructure in the national government
            that has steadily taken place since the 1990s. This has dramatically
            narrowed the constituency who want infrastructure projects to go
            ahead while also wanting to minimise their costs. The various ways
            in which British infrastructure projects have become increasingly
            slow, contested and expensive are all functions of this underlying
            mechanism.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, infrastructure was
            generally funded and delivered privately. The railway system, the
            canal network, the turnpike roads and the London Underground were
            all built by private companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quasi-private models remained common to the end of the twentieth
            century, including ‘build, own, operate, transfer’ (the Channel
            Tunnel) and the private finance initiative (M6 Toll, Tramlink).
            Other schemes were delivered through arms-length bodies, like London
            Transport (Victoria Line). Others still were delivered by local
            governments. Most of Britain’s 300-some tram networks were laid by
            local authorities, with neither support nor direction from national
            government.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all of these cases there is a strong constituency who
            <em>both</em> strongly want the project to go ahead,
            <em>and</em> also want costs to stay low. Private companies may
            literally cease to exist if they fail to deliver their product while
            keeping costs reasonably low, and although local governments will
            continue to exist in some form, local councillors will be punished
            severely by the small local electorates who have to pick up the bill
            generated by their mismanagement. Companies and financially
            responsible local governments thus have a vivid interest in keeping
            costs down if they are on the hook for them, and they will lobby
            zealously against cost bloating. A
            <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tramways-Trolleys-Urban-Transport-Europe/dp/0691052409">leading historian of Britain’s tram networks</a>
            writes of the ‘ardent desire’ of local councils that tram networks
            turn a profit, which could then be used to subsidise other services
            or cut local rates. Sure enough, councils vigorously cut costs,
            dispensing with the expensive underground wire systems that were
            widely used in Continental cities as a sop to local objectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            This pattern of behaviour continues to hold today in many countries.
            French cities pay 50 percent towards nearly all mass transit
            projects that affect them, and sometimes 100 percent (with regional
            and national government contributing the rest). Unsurprisingly, they
            then fight energetically to suppress cost bloat, and they generally
            succeed. The Madrid Metro, one of the world’s finest systems, was
            funded entirely by the Madrid region. A smaller and poorer
            municipality than London succeeded in financing 203 kilometres of
            metro extensions with 132 stations between 1995 and 2011, about 13
            times the length of the contemporary Jubilee Line Extension in
            London. Other countries still operate systems of private
            infrastructure delivery: Tokyo’s legendary transit network is
            delivered, and regularly expanded, by private companies who
            <a href="https://etd723z5379.exactdn.com/app/uploads/2024/04/2198_1524_LP2011_ch12_Transit_Value_Capture_0.pdf">fund development by speculating on land around stations</a>. France’s superb system of motorways is built and maintained by
            private companies, who manage them with vigour and financial
            discipline.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Britain, the centralisation of infrastructure delivery in the
            national government has fundamentally weakened this incentive. No
            public body will ever have quite the existential interest in cost
            control that a private one does. But national government also has a
            weaker interest in it than a financially responsible local
            government does, because the cost is diffused around a vastly larger
            electorate. The £300 million spent on the Lower Thames Crossing
            consenting process is one of the great absurdities of modern British
            governance, but it still comes to less than £5 per British person.
            For almost any given infrastructure project, the national Government
            can waste money buying off militant stakeholder groups, and the
            immediate cost remains invisibly small to the huge electorate that
            ultimately bears it. But the aggregate effect of all these small
            pay-offs is outrageous cost bloat, unaffordable infrastructure, and
            the relative impoverishment of the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the Edinburgh Tram. It was built in two phases. The first,
            completed in 2014, was described as ‘<a href="https://benhopkinson.substack.com/p/hell-on-wheels-the-edinburgh-trams">hell on wheels</a>’, by its former chairman, overrunning from a £545 million budget
            to £776 million. Of the original budget,
            <a href="https://www.edinburghtraminquiry.org/final_report/the-inquiry-report/">£500 million came directly from the Scottish government</a>, and £45 million was provided by the council. The second,
            completed in 2023, was funded by borrowing against future fare
            revenues. It came in
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/infrastructure-costs-trams">about thirty percent cheaper per mile</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the proximate causes listed above are ways in which this
            underlying pattern manifests itself. Profligate gold-plating,
            exorbitant community compensation, endless rounds of consultation,
            elaborate legal obligations, reliance on consultants and so on all
            naturally arise when none of the parties involved has any serious
            incentive to oppose them. If Britain wants affordable
            infrastructure, it needs a system in which those who make the
            decision to spend money also bear some of the costs of doing so.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most conspicuous result of this cost bloat is of course that the
            infrastructure projects that do happen tend to be wildly expensive.
            But perhaps the most important effect is the projects that do not
            happen at all. The Treasury correctly believes that, under current
            conditions, public infrastructure projects in Britain will be
            wastefully mismanaged. Its only way of protecting public finances is
            thus by blocking these projects altogether. Given the means
            available to it, this decision is often the correct one.
          </p>
          <p>
            But stepping back, we should recognise that many of the projects
            blocked by the Treasury could have excellent value for money if only
            they were delivered at costs that were historically and remain
            internationally normal. The notorious ‘feast and famine’ procurement
            pattern of some types of British infrastructure is also thought to
            be a consequence of this; the Treasury blocks routine schemes, so
            only schemes with exceptional political or economic support take
            place, which by nature arise only intermittently and unpredictably.
          </p>
          <p>
            The theory that infrastructure costs are prone to bloating when they
            are paid for centrally is supported by the example of the one kind
            of infrastructure that has remained relatively cheap, namely roads.
            Despite some big failures like
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/a-boring-story-about-infrastructure">the Lower Thames Crossing</a>, Britain ranks
            <a href="https://www.britainremade.co.uk/britain_paying_up_to_eight_times_more_than_eu_for_road_and_rail_projects_research_finds#:~:text=A%20study%20by%20Britain%20Remade,Italy%2C%20Sweden%2C%20and%20Norway.">mid-table</a>
            overall, a better performance than for any other infrastructure
            type. The reason for this is that roads directly benefit a much
            wider constituency than any given railway project:
            <a href="https://onlinepubs.trb.org/Onlinepubs/trr/1976/583/583-004.pdf">pretty much anyone in the nearby area</a>
            rather than just the people
            <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F9WxjexWwAAnEnw?format=jpg&amp;name=large">within about one kilometre of a given station</a>. What’s more,
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2022/national-travel-survey-2022-factsheet-accessible#:~:text=Cars%20remained%20the%20most%20popular,1%20percentage%20point%20from%202019).">94 percent of miles travelled in the UK are on roads</a>
            (80 percent in private cars, and 14 percent on buses and coaches),
            so many more people see themselves as having a stake in the issue.
            The tendency for local obstructionism is thus weaker, and even
            national government tends not to end up with spiralling costs. For
            the bulk of the projects, funded (or part-funded) and delivered by
            local councils themselves, the effect is even stronger.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why the M25 could be delivered affordably through the
            traditional planning system, even with a spectacular 39 separate
            inquiries. In 1987, the first election after the M25 was finished
            and opened, Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives won every constituency
            the road went through, including large swings in historic Labour
            seats like Thurrock.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this model only works for this kind of locally uncontroversial
            infrastructure. For the contentious but vital projects that the
            country needs – railways, viaducts, bridges, nuclear power stations,
            tramways, wind farms – systemic reform is needed.
          </p>
          <h4 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h4>
          <p>
            Because of bad delivery mechanisms, British infrastructure is
            delivered slowly and at great cost. When infrastructure is costly,
            less of it is delivered. To understand how bad this is, it is worth
            reviewing why infrastructure is important.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like housing, transport infrastructure is vitally important for
            growth because it determines who can do which jobs. Reliable, fast
            transport infrastructure allows people to access a wider range of
            job options, and businesses to access a wider pool of talent to
            employ and to transport goods and services more easily. By
            increasing the speed you can get around, infrastructure expands the
            effective ‘economic size’ of a city, no less effectively than
            building more houses does. A ten percent increase in the number of
            jobs accessible per worker increases productivity 2.4 percent. A 10
            percent increase in commuting speed
            <a href="https://x.com/Sam_Dumitriu/status/1101073388322410496">increases the size of the labour market by 15–18 percent</a>. Without the M25 and the suburban railway network, places like
            Sevenoaks, Luton, Reading, Guildford, Stansted, Chelmsford, and
            Woking would not be tied economically to the broader London
            metropolis. Companies in those places would not be able to hire from
            as big a pool; people living there would not be able to reach the
            best jobs.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also enables both internal and cross-border trade. The Eurostar
            helps British services firms sell to Parisian and Brusselian
            companies. Heathrow is a core reason why international firms have
            headquarters in London. The strategic road network lets companies
            and consumers all over the country import and export goods through
            the country’s seaports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Britain’s transport infrastructure deficit means that it forgoes
            these benefits. We can’t build new tramways or a metro cheaply in
            Birmingham, so the city is
            <a href="https://www.tomforth.co.uk/birminghamisasmallcity/">riddled with road congestion</a>, and people choose lower-paying jobs with worse working conditions
            because they are easier to get to rather than because they are the
            best for their careers. Without the Lower Thames Crossing, road
            haulage to and from the Ports of Dover and Felixstowe has to move
            over the congested and further-flung Dartford Crossing, slowing down
            and raising costs for British firms looking to trade
            internationally.

            <span>Commuting flows in England and Wales. High quality infrastructure
              is the reason why so many can commute miles to bigger job markets
              than where they live.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A second and vitally important benefit from all infrastructure is
            that, without it, locals oppose new homes near them. If there is
            already congestion on the roads they use, or they are already unable
            to get a seat on their morning train,
            <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/growing-the-growth-coalition/">they have a powerful reason to oppose new development</a>. Thus, new infrastructure enables new homes and makes them
            politically much easier to build. The infrastructure deficit makes
            them correspondingly harder.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, the infrastructure deficit is literally making new
            development in Britain unlawful. Because Britain has not built a new
            reservoir for thirty years, there are chronic water shortages in the
            East of England. This means that the Environment Agency has begun to
            <a href="https://www.planningresource.co.uk/article/1828079/environment-agency-objects-plans-almost-5000-homes-significant-risk-water-demand">block new housing</a>
            on the basis that it could only be supplied with water through
            drawing on environmentally valuable chalk streams. The result is
            that it is virtually unlawful for the Government to permit the
            expansion of Cambridge, leading to the gradual strangulation of
            Britain’s biotech industry. The same problem will compromise any new
            town scheme that the Government wants to initiate in large parts of
            the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            This chapter has focussed on the deficit in transport
            infrastructure. But there is another infrastructure deficit that is
            at least as grave: energy. Energy costs are rising steeply in
            Britain, starving energy-intensive industries and undermining living
            standards. This disastrous trend has deep causes, to which we turn
            in the next chapter.

            Britain: the first energy superpower<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-source-6">6</a></sup>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Between 1550 and 1700, Britain transformed from a normal European
            country, depending on peat and wood for heating homes, to by far
            Europe’s biggest coal producer and consumer. Every coal-producing
            region upped its output by at least ten times. By 1640, Britain was
            mining around 1.5 million tonnes of coal per year, about three times
            as much as the rest of Europe put together.
          </p>
          <p>
            This energy boom set off growth in an uncountable number of other
            industries. The Firth of Forth started exporting salt all over
            Europe, including to salt-producing regions like the Low Countries.
            Britain’s coal allowed it to become a major producer of soap,
            candles, starch, saltpetre (for gunpowder), alum and copperas (for
            fixing dyes into clothes), as well as being used in brewing, dyeing,
            making malt, baking bread, making tiles and bricks, forging and
            working iron, copper, brass, lead, silver, and tin, glass, and
            bending staves and beams for barrels and ships.
          </p>
          <p>
            It went much further than these cases. Coal is used to produce lime.
            Cheaper and more abundant coal meant dramatically more lime.
            Dramatically more lime meant dramatically more fertiliser, which
            meant much more productive grain fields. More salt meant more meat
            and fish preservation, raising the productivity of pasture land.
            Peatlands and heaths were no longer necessary for fuel, so they
            could be converted to arable land or pastures.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this meant more muscle power – horses and oxen – which
            powered the earliest machinery. These animals were put to an
            enormous range of uses, and their extreme proliferation in Britain
            wowed Europeans throughout the 1600s and 1700s. And it meant more
            human muscle power. The average Briton ate something like 600
            calories more per day than the average Frenchman, and was about five
            centimetres taller.
          </p>
          <p>
            All this is to say that Britain was the first energy superpower, and
            it built its global economic dominance on the back of, above all,
            cheaper and more abundant energy than anywhere else. Until the 1920s
            it produced more energy per person than any other country. Until the
            1960s it produced more energy than any other country but America.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            As coal’s enormous downsides were recognised – horrific lung issues
            for those mining it and inhaling its fumes, as well as devastating
            smogs – in 1956 we became the first of all countries to move to the
            energy technology of the future: nuclear. In its early years,
            Britain was the world leader in nuclear power. In 1965 we had 21
            nuclear reactors, compared to 19 in the rest of the world combined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uranium’s energy density – three million times higher than coal –
            suggested that it could be much cheaper as a source of power, since
            it would not necessitate so much mining and transportation. We
            didn’t realise then that nuclear power could also help us to avoid
            damaging climate change. But had we continued down that path, we
            would have inadvertently decarbonised, like France.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dki5hzod1/image/upload/v1726794866/nuclear_power_decline_d84pdg.png" alt="nuclear_power_decline"/>
          </p>
          <p>
            If we had only kept pace with the rate of nuclear rollout that we
            had between 1956 and 1998, by extending the lifetimes of our older
            plants and adding new ones, today we would be producing around 150
            TWh of nuclear power per year, or around 50 percent of our total
            current electricity generation. But we did not. Nuclear power in
            Britain is now half of what it was at its peak, and energy costs
            today are higher than they have been for a century.

            There are good reasons to want the UK to have a large, productive
            industrial base. But any industrial strategy aimed at doing this
            must first reckon with the enormous rises in energy prices for UK
            businesses since the mid-2000s.
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/gas-and-electricity-prices-in-the-non-domestic-sector">The industrial price of electricity</a>
            rose by 153 percent between 2004 and 2021, adjusted for inflation.
            It rose even more brutally again after the Russian invasion of
            Ukraine. Very large industrial customers (those consuming
            70,000–150,000 megawatt-hours of electricity every six months) paid
            more than twice as much in Britain (13.79p per kilowatt-hour) for
            electricity in 2021 as their counterparts in France did (6.62p per
            kilowatt-hour), and, again, the gap has grown since Russia’s
            invasion of Ukraine. Even if energy costs eventually fall back to
            normal pre-war levels, those are still much more expensive in real
            terms than twenty years ago. Fixing this has to be step one for any
            serious industrial strategy.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            High energy costs are a problem across the developed world. Energy
            consumption per capita in even the relatively fast-growing United
            States has flatlined from the early 1970s oil crisis onwards. But
            things are much worse here.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The UK’s energy use per person has long been far behind that of the
            United States, but it fell behind both France and Germany in the
            post-war era. Despite moderate improvements under Thatcher, it has
            slid since the mid-2000s to fall further below other countries.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Britain’s energy use per unit of GDP
            <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/energy-intensity">is now the lowest in the G7</a>, and is lower than nearly every region and every non-tax-haven in
            both Europe and the OECD. By many measures, Britain is the most
            energy-starved nation in the developed world.
          </p>

          <p>
            The problem of high energy costs for manufacturing was raised by
            Mario Draghi’s
            <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/97e481fd-2dc3-412d-be4c-f152a8232961_en?filename=The%20future%20of%20European%20competitiveness%20_%20A%20competitiveness%20strategy%20for%20Europe.pdf">recent report on EU competitiveness</a>, which highlighted the strong correlation between an industry’s
            energy intensiveness and its decline since the outbreak of the
            Ukraine war. Draghi also warned that the EU’s traditional
            manufacturing strengths, such as automobiles, were at risk of being
            outcompeted by other countries with cheaper energy.

            Yet British firms pay on average 60 percent more for electricity
            than French ones (the gap is larger for larger customers, as
            mentioned above). The total amount of energy used by the steel
            industry has fallen by about three quarters in the last two decades.
            UK Steel says that ‘long-standing uncompetitive electricity prices
            have constrained UK investment and steel production for some time’,
            and in 2022 when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drove energy prices to
            their highest-ever levels,
            <a href="https://www.makeuk.org/news-and-events/news/news-from-uk-steel---recent-power-price-spikes">some steel plants paused production at times of the day when
              prices were spiking</a>. And steel is only one example:

              this problem go away</a>. Data centres, the infrastructure backbone of the internet, have
            become even more essential as artificial intelligence has risen,
            since they are required for both the training and use of AI models.
            And they require enormous amounts of electricity.
          </p>
          <p>
            A large data centre can require
            <a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-to-build-an-ai-data-center">over 100 megawatts of power, more than 300,000 homes</a>. Electricity is so essential to data centres’ output that
            <a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-to-build-an-ai-data-center">their scale is typically measured in terms of their electricity
              needs instead of their square footage</a>. Last year they accounted for

            Britain building many large, efficient, well-powered data centres.

            Unfortunately, most prominent examples of industrial strategy ignore
            that high energy costs are by far the biggest problem facing British
            industry today. Subsidies for British industry, like
            <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/476c629c-2918-4836-8b27-362967f9f6dd">the recent commitment to give Tata £500 million to invest in
              steelmaking here,</a>
            are an expensive sticking plaster on this much bigger wound.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66a79e0bfc8e12ac3edb0629/DUKES_1.1.1.xlsx">Just over three quarters of the energy we use</a>
            still comes from gas and oil, directly heating our houses and
            powering our cars. Gas is also widely used for industrial heat
            generation. But we are attempting to electrify our economy, which
            means replacing gas boilers with heat pumps, and petrol cars with
            electric ones. Shifting to electric road vehicles
            <a href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/uk-ev-electricity-demand">will create 40 percent more <em>total</em> electricity demand</a>. Data centres are entirely reliant on electricity. Rising
            temperatures from climate change will necessitate
            <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/heat-waves">more use of air conditioning</a>
            that runs on electricity. So it is especially worrying that we are
            so far behind peer economies on electricity generation, and have
            been generating less and less electricity since the start of the
            century.

            If energy stagnation is,
            <a href="https://press.stripe.com/where-is-my-flying-car">as some economists and engineers have suggested</a>, a cause of the West’s slowdown over the past fifty years, then it
            should be no surprise that Britain’s economy has fared as badly as
            it has. Along with inadequate housing and transport, this is one of
            the most fundamental weaknesses of the contemporary British economy.
            Any attempt to change course has to accept the central importance of
            cheap, abundant energy to prosperity.

            Britain has committed, with the rest of the developed world, to
            bringing its carbon emissions down significantly over the next three
            decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greenhouse gas emitters do not bear the true costs they impose on
            the world. A (<a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9935/">border-adjusted</a>) carbon tax that made them pay the social cost of the emissions
            they created would make the true costs of their emissions clear, and
            would make cleaner forms of energy significantly more
            cost-competitive, and possibly outright cheaper. It would also
            provide an ‘automatic’ impetus to develop and adopt technologies
            like carbon capture and carbon removal.
          </p>
          <p>
            But carbon taxes have often failed politically where they have been
            tried, pushing politicians towards subsidies, price guarantees and
            other incentives to move to clean energy sources instead. Though
            this approach still tilts the balance toward cleaner technologies,
            its true costs are hidden. And because this approach necessitates
            the government picking winners, it may mean paths to decarbonisation
            that are much more costly than others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Intermittent renewables, which are primarily wind and solar power in
            the British market, are sources that, though clean, cannot produce a
            constant supply of electricity, and cannot be turned on at will.
            This means that the marginal price of electricity
            <em>as traded between generators and energy suppliers</em> is
            largely set by the marginal cost of booting up power plants that can
            produce enough to meet demand at any given time. Usually those
            plants run on natural gas. This means that short-term wholesale
            electricity prices tend to be set by gas prices.
          </p>
          <p>
            The price of electricity as actually paid by consumers, however,
            differs from the <em>wholesale</em> cost of electricity as traded
            between generators and suppliers. This wholesale cost is only about
            <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9491/">30-40 percent of the total bill</a>
            that a consumer pays. Electricity consumers, which include both
            industrial consumers and households, need to pay for the costs of
            the entire electricity system, not just generation: the transmission
            and distribution networks, the growing costs of balancing the grid,
            plus a margin for suppliers, plus the policy costs of whatever
            subsidies to electricity generators the government has seen fit to
            pay, plus the costs of contracts for rarely-used but essential
            emergency backup generation. There is no necessary reason why these
            costs need to fall on energy consumers: some could equally well be
            paid from general taxation. But either way the costs must be paid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, from the perspective of a consumer, what matters is not
            the price of electricity from a given wind farm as traded on the
            wholesale market, but the total cost of the entire electricity
            supply system.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is commonplace to claim that electricity generated from
            <a href="https://x.com/Ed_Miliband/status/1562444641236316161">wind</a>
            <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crkm5p1x6deo">or solar</a>
            power is <em>cheaper</em> than electricity from traditional power
            plants. Yet the more wind and solar we hook up to the grid, and the
            more fossil fuel power plants we retire, the higher bills seem to
            go.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In fact, intermittent renewable energy is nowhere near commercially
            competitive. According to the
            <a href="https://obr.uk/download/march-2024-economic-and-fiscal-outlook-detailed-forecast-tables-receipts/?tmstv=1726074283">Office for Budget Responsibility</a>
            and Ofgem, the direct costs of subsidies of renewable power
            generation now exceed £10 billion a year, across the Renewables
            Obligation, Contracts for Difference, and
            <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications/feed-tariffs-fit-annual-report-2022-23">Feed-in-Tariff schemes</a>, which provide a guaranteed price for electricity generated by
            renewables over, normally, a fifteen-year time horizon. The
            <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6ad7c6eb664e57141db4b/Contracts_for_Difference_Allocation_Round_6_results.pdf">September 2024 auction for Contracts for Difference</a>, which covered new supply equivalent to eight percent of the UK’s
            current electricity generation, concluded with the state
            guaranteeing an inflation-indexed price
            <a href="https://x.com/RichardOllingtn/status/1830922442526859688">30 percent higher than current wholesale market prices</a>
            to a range of renewable energy suppliers for the next 15 years.
            These costs are passed on to energy customers through higher prices.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as well as the direct subsidy needed to make intermittent
            sources of electricity profitable, these renewables increase other
            system-level costs that are paid by consumers. There are three main
            sources of this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>More need for transmission lines to connect generation to
                households and industry</strong>. Traditionally, power plants were located fairly close to major
              population centres. The highest wind speeds, however, are
              available offshore and in northern Scotland. Add in the impact of
              the planning system pushing wind farms to locate in more remote
              places, and the result is that the annual costs of transmission
              maintenance and installation have risen from
              <a href="https://www.nationalgrideso.com/document/49546/download">£1.35 billion in 2008/9</a>
              to
              <a href="https://www.nationalgrideso.com/document/294586/download">over £4 billion in 2024/25</a>.
              <a href="https://www.nationalgrideso.com/news/eso-publishes-pathway-2030-major-step-deliver-50gw-offshore-wind-2030">The UK’s electricity system operator plans for £54 billion</a>
              of total transmission spending between now and 2030, citing the
              need to accommodate a large increase in offshore wind generation
              during this period.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Increased grid balancing costs.</strong> Electricity
              supply must be matched to demand on a second-by-second basis. As
              increasing fractions of the generation mix become
              weather-dependent and hence to a degree uncontrollable and
              unpredictable, the grid operator needs to spend more money both on
              paying generators to switch off when supply exceeds demand, but
              also for emergency backup generation to come online when wind
              speeds drop. These balancing costs
              <a href="https://www.nationalgrideso.com/document/318516/download">are estimated at £2.4 billion for 2023/24</a>, and
              <a href="https://www.nationalgrideso.com/document/318516/download">are estimated by the Electricity System Operator to rise to
                over £4 billion a year by the end of the decade</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The costs of paying for backup capacity</strong>. This is
              especially important for periods of multi-week lulls in wind
              speeds, which can occur during periods with overcast weather that
              curtail solar generation as well. These periods require a fleet of
              dispatchable plants with total capacity approximately equal to
              peak demand, powered either by gas or, in some envisioned Net Zero
              scenarios, hydrogen stored for years in underground salt caverns.
              Batteries may become viable for energy storage across a day or a
              few days, but seem unlikely to be able to provide for weeks-long
              lulls in wind and sunlight. Currently the UK has
              <a href="https://www.renewableuk.com/news/660775/Pipeline-of-UK-energy-storage-projects-grows-by-two-thirds-over-last-12-months.htm">4.6 gigawatt-hours of battery storage capacity</a>, or about 0.3 percent of daily energy demand.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once these system-level costs are accounted for, building a grid
            around wind and solar power is much more expensive than implied by
            the Levelized Cost of Energy (or LCOE) estimates typically cited by
            government departments or the press, and – along with the
            decommissioning of coal and gas-fired power plants since the 2000s –
            explains why Britain’s electricity costs have risen so much compared
            to other countries’.
          </p>
          <p>
            None of this section is to say that intermittent renewables are bad
            or pointless. Reducing carbon emissions is essential, and the true
            cost of fossil fuels is higher than it appears because of the carbon
            emissions they create. We can improve efficiency by allowing
            electricity prices to reflect the actual cost of supplying
            electricity to a given premises (what is known as locational
            pricing) and the real-time value of the electricity (time-of-use
            pricing).
          </p>
          <p>
            In many parts of the world the problems these power sources face are
            much less significant: for example, where there is more constant
            sunshine across the year, solar is much less intermittent. It may
            turn out that building interconnectors between Britain and
            continental Europe and Africa means we can import solar electricity
            from these sunnier latitudes.
            <a href="https://aquind.co.uk/">A proposed interconnector</a>
            between Portsmouth and France would add 2,000 megawatts, or 16
            terawatt hours a year, to Britain’s electricity supply: enough to
            power twenty large data centres, four million new homes, or
            one-seventh of our road transport needs if we switched entirely to
            electric vehicles. However, this project and others like it
            <a href="https://watt-logic.com/2024/06/28/ofgem-throws-a-spanner-into-gbs-interconnector-ambitions/">may be rejected by Ofgem, the energy regulator</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or we may make technological breakthroughs, for example in
            ultra-dense battery storage, or in atmospheric carbon capture, that
            make some of our current problems irrelevant. But, for now, the
            current consensus in favour of large, increasing subsidies for
            intermittent renewables in Britain is a consensus in favour of high
            and rising energy costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to prosper again, Britain needs abundant and reliable clean
            energy. Intermittent renewables may be able to give us this someday,
            but they cannot provide it yet. Thankfully, there is a technology
            that can: nuclear power.
          </p>
          <h4 id="nuclear-power">Nuclear power</h4>
          <p>
            Nuclear power avoids the biggest problem that solar and wind power
            face: it produces constant amounts of electricity across the day and
            year. This means we can depend on it. Its operation produces
            essentially zero carbon dioxide. It already provides
            <a href="https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/WorldStatistics/NuclearShareofElectricityGeneration.aspx">two thirds of France’s electricity</a>. And it
            <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-from-energy-production-per-twh">is safer than almost any other source of electricity, even wind
              power</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Britain, once a world leader in atomic power, hasn&#39;t built a new
            nuclear power station in the last 28 years, during which period
            <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/the-role-of-nuclear-in-the-uks-energy-supply/">it has shuttered eight</a>
            reactors – and
            <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/reports/the-decommissioning-of-the-agr-nuclear-power-stations/">eight more are set for the chop</a>. Nuclear power accounts for only 12.5 percent of our annual
            electricity output.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The cost of building new reactors has become eye-wateringly high.
            Our nuclear power construction costs are the second highest in the
            world, but this is not inevitable or inherent in the technology:
            nuclear power
            <a href="https://jackdevanney.substack.com/p/nuclear-is-too-expensive">was once cost-competitive with <em>coal</em></a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike with intermittent power, however, these high costs are not
            intrinsic to nuclear. In general, it is expensive to build reactors
            for the same extraneous reasons that it is expensive to build
            railways and trams. And, as with trams and trains, if we can make it
            cheaper to build nuclear reactors, we can have a lot more of them.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Britain wasn’t always this expensive. For plants constructed before
            1995, Britain averaged £4.79 million per MW, about half of the
            estimated costs for Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C. Even the most
            expensive reactors permissioned and commissioned under Margaret
            Thatcher and John Major, Sizewell B and Torness, were only
            two-thirds the price in real terms of the plants we are planning
            today. These plants have produced zero-emissions power for decades

            One reason nuclear power is so expensive to build is that it is
            beset by extreme delays and uncertainty caused by planning and
            environmental approval processes. These arise even when deploying
            completely safe, widely used designs that have been built in Britain
            before. From being proposed in a UK government white paper, to the
            start of construction, Hinkley Point C took ten years. By contrast,
            France and Finland have started building similar reactors in just
            three or four.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a
            <a href="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/themes/64129ab34764e88389de397e/attachments/original/1680254554/Powerbook-Brochure-WEBAWK_REV3.pdf?1680254554">44,260 page</a>
            environmental impact assessment (EIA) and 2,229 written questions at
            examination stage, Sizewell C, the next reactor after Hinkley Point
            C, faced enormous expense before a spade was even in the ground
            (which it still is not). As the recent MHCLG policy paper
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/getting-great-britain-building-again-speeding-up-infrastructure-delivery/getting-great-britain-building-again-speeding-up-infrastructure-delivery">Getting Great Britain building again</a>
            pointed out, Sizewell C’s EIA is ‘more than 30 times longer than the
            complete works of Shakespeare.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Nuclear power has also suffered from many of the problems that have
            inflated the cost of transport projects. Rather than setting up a
            pipeline of nuclear projects, we are designing and approving each
            one in isolation. There is no strong interest group in favour of
            reducing costs, so trivial objections – like the ‘problem’ of a few
            dozen fish being sucked into a reactor’s cooling system and killed –
            lead to further delays and expense (in this case,
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/visiting-the-worlds-most-expensive">with an underwater megaphone to scare fish away</a>). Spurious concerns about trace amounts of background radiation,
            long-debunked by the hundreds of nuclear reactors in operation
            worldwide, are treated with grave seriousness in each case, rather
            than being immediately identified and dismissed as obstructionist
            pseudoscience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although most of the developed world has suffered similar increases
            in the cost of building new nuclear, although less extreme than
            Britain’s, there are some notable exceptions. South Korea stands out
            among developed countries as building nuclear power stations that
            are reliable, safe, and cheap: Korea builds reactors domestically
            for about a sixth of the cost that Britain does.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key reason it can do this is that it builds nuclear plants in
            fleets. For each design, KEPCO, South Korea’s nuclear company,
            builds 8-12 reactors in a row, meaning it benefits from economies of
            scale and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning-by-doing_(economics)">learns by doing</a>. (Similar benefits of learning-by-doing through repeated builds of
            similar designs have been observed in the
            <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/chinas-impressive-rate-of-nuclear-construction">Chinese nuclear build-out.</a>) KEPCO is now building reactors for the UAE at
            <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-britain-is-building-the-worlds-most-expensive-nuclear-plant/">less than half the cost of Hinkley Point C</a>
            per unit of energy.
            <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/KHNP-selected-to-supply-new-Czech-nuclear-units">It has just been contracted to build in Czechia</a>
            for <em>a quarter</em> the price of Hinkley.
          </p>
          <p>
            The UK thus has one hard, but potentially rewarding, option of
            attempting to streamline nuclear reactor approvals and delivery,
            perhaps through opening up a new pathway to ‘small modular reactors’
            or ‘microreactors’ that avoids the wasteful cost of our existing
            regulatory system. If successful, this would have the dual benefit
            of enabling cheap, abundant, clean energy, <em>and</em> the creation
            of a potential export industry that could offer cheap nuclear power
            to other developed countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            The faster and cheaper option would be to simply follow the Czechs
            and call KEPCO, asking how many nuclear reactors it could provide at
            similar or lower costs, and how quickly they can get going.

            Britain’s rise to become the world’s first industrial nation was
            predicated on its remarkably early exploitation of fossil fuels,
            especially coal. The age of coal is over. But in the 1950s and
            1960s, another era as an energy giant and industrial power seemed to
            be dawning, with the rise of nuclear power, a technology in which we
            led for decades. Our failure to do this was
            <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn04046/">cushioned by the discovery of North Sea oil</a>. It can’t cushion us any more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deindustrialisation was not the inevitable result of economic
            progress. To our
            <a href="https://w3.unece.org/SDG/en/Indicator?id=130">$4,300</a> of
            annual manufacturing output per capita, the Americans produce
            $6,700; the Swedes $7,300; the Germans $8,500; and the Swiss
            $20,000. These are all advanced economies in which the biggest
            fraction of employment and output is services. But part of their
            higher productivity is that they have kept their energy costs well
            below ours and avoided the erosion of their industrial base that we
            have experienced.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can reverse this. Abundant clean energy is achievable with
            technology that already exists. What is lacking is a reliable
            pathway to allow it to get built. Fix that, and Britain could see
            itself become an industrial heavyweight for the second time in its
            history.

            The fundamental thesis of this essay is that Britain can have rapid
            economic growth in the near future, swiftly catching up with the
            world’s most prosperous countries. It can do this because the
            sources of its current sclerosis are easy to identify and
            straightforward, in principle, to fix. The problem is not too little
            investment by the state. It is that the state has prohibited most of
            the investments we need to make. The solution is to remove these
            obstacles to investment, mobility and trade, in a politically viable
            and durable way.
          </p>
          <p>
            We should not despair. Britain has been here before a century ago,
            and triumphed. By the end of the 1920s, Britain was still reeling
            from the national catastrophe of the First World War. Many damaging
            emergency measures that had been brought in during the War still
            lingered, it was recovering from levels of inflation never seen
            before or since, and economic growth had slowed to a crawl.
          </p>
          <p>
            The housing sector was moribund, thanks to a combination of rent
            controls imposed during the First World War, tight lending policy,
            and the effects of rapid inflation, which made the rent controls
            even more punitive in real terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stanley Baldwin’s government abolished rent controls and removed
            mortgage regulations by 1932, causing a dramatic housing boom that
            provided the foundations for the British economic miracle of the
            1930s. Millions of extra homes were built in just six years – the
            fastest period of building ever – probably
            <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/escaping-liquidity-traps-lessons-uks-1930s-escape">adding several percentage points to GDP growth in just a few
              years</a>. The homes were concentrated in the cities in which Britain’s key
            growth industries were based, giving those industries access to the
            workforce they needed to continue expanding. It may have been the
            greatest rapid expansion in a given economic sector in British
            history, and it was the key reason we didn’t experience a Great
            Depression while Germany, the USA, and France did.
          </p>
          <p>
            These homes were enabled by rapid infrastructure development: new
            roads such as the A3 Kingston Bypass, an enormous expansion of the
            bus network, and extensions of many of the major railways and tube
            networks, with the Piccadilly, District and Northern Lines sweeping
            out into suburban London.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this time Britain built its national electricity grid, in one
            of the most remarkable achievements of engineering and public works
            in modern history. In the space of three years, the new Central
            Electricity Board
            <a href="https://www.nationalgrid.com/about-us/what-we-do/our-history/history-electricity-britain">devised a plan</a>
            to connect more than 100 of the UK’s most efficient power stations
            into seven local grids across the country, and passed the
            legislation needed to enable the plan and begin work on it. It took
            just five years for the project to be completed in 1936, with 4,000
            miles of cables running across 26,000 pylons around the country
            being built in this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1937, a year after the seven local grids were finished, a group
            of impatient and rebellious engineers
            <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/building-back-faster/">switched on the connections</a>
            between the seven grid areas themselves to form a single national
            system, deciding it was easier to ask forgiveness than permission.
            They created a world-class grid that remains in operation to this
            day. The price of electricity
            <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/UK_historical_electricity_price_1921-1990.svg/750px-UK_historical_electricity_price_1921-1990.svg.png">collapsed</a>
            and the share of the population connected to electricity soared,
            rising faster than in any other country on earth. Britain went from
            being a laggard to a leader in electrification in just a few years.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that Britain can enjoy such a renewal once more. To do
            so, it need simply remove the barriers that stop the private sector
            from doing what it already wants to do: build homes, bridges,
            tunnels, roads, trams, railways, nuclear power plants, grid
            connections, prisons, aqueducts, reservoirs, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            The immediate effect would be large increases in employment in
            construction, energy, real estate, plumbing, factories, steelworks,
            cement production, surveying, architecture, design, and more. It
            would mean large inflows of capital to invest in these newly
            available opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is massive pent-up demand for new housing, more energy supply,
            more and better transport links, and more childcare provision, as
            shown by their high prices. Since a price is ‘a signal wrapped in an
            incentive’, making it easier to build and supply these things would
            not require top-down direction or government spending.
          </p>
          <p>
            The short-term effect, then, would be a surge of economic activity
            as these investments were made. But the real benefits come when
            those investments begin to pay off.
          </p>
          <p>
            The medium-term effect would be to dramatically increase
            productivity growth in the UK, driven by agglomeration. It would
            mean more people accessing high quality jobs, allowing productive
            companies to hire more people and scale up, and to operate cheaply
            thanks to cheaper commercial premises and lab space, and cheaper
            energy. Services companies would expand rapidly, and new companies
            would be set up. The cheaper energy would rejuvenate many of the
            traditional industries of the North of England, including
            manufacturing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the long run, cheaper housing in particular would have a range of
            knock-on effects. Cheaper housing means more affordable childcare
            and bedrooms, and less of a trade-off between having children and
            staying in the city to be close to friends and job. All of these
            will help families to afford more children, if they want them,
            making it easier to bear the costs of an ageing population.
          </p>
          <p>
            More agglomeration also means more innovation. A larger labour pool
            gives innovative firms more options about whom to hire, and more
            similar companies with which to partner to come up with new ideas.
            Allowing the science-based industries around Oxford and
            <a href="https://www.createstreets.com/the-promise-of-cambridge/">Cambridge</a>
            to grow as freely as their competitors in places like Silicon Valley
            and Boston can allow a virtuous cycle where more and more innovative
            companies start up or locate in these cities, creating greater and
            greater returns to similar firms coming there too, and more scope
            for productive collaboration between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fundamentally, making building possible would unlock the promise of
            the British economy. All the ideas, entrepreneurs, researchers, and
            skilled workers we have are being held back from being as productive
            as they could be, and the aggregate cost is that the country is much
            poorer than it should be. If we address this, Britain could be once
            again among the richest of nations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In its turn, affluence would – if wisely used – begin to solve many
            of Britain’s other problems. Public services could be given more
            generously funded, facilitating reforms to make them more efficient.
            Aided by planning reform, we could build new and better resourced
            hospitals, yielding shorter waiting lists and better patient
            outcomes. We could adopt the generous family policies of places like
            <a href="https://ifstudies.org/ifs-admin/resources/reports/ifs-southerneuropereport-final-1.pdf">France</a>
            and
            <a href="https://www.boomcampaign.org/p/the-province-defying-italys-birth">South Tyrol</a>
            to allow younger couples to have children sooner if they wish to,
            widening the choices available to the British people while helping
            to secure their long-term future. Elderly Britons could receive the
            finest care in the world, delivered through immigration only if we
            wish, and not as a substitute for adequate funding. Britain could
            have a new generation of schools, like the great board schools that
            rose over the cities of the nineteenth century. We could expand our
            prison, police and prosecution services, becoming again a virtually
            crime-free society such as our grandparents knew, and such as Japan
            remains today. We could have the finest armed forces in Europe,
            playing again a decisive role in defending the law-governed world
            order that Britain did so much to bring into being.
          </p>
          <p>
            We began this essay by saying that unlocking prosperity can
            reinforce what is best in Britain’s social settlement. The parallel
            to the 1930s should remind us of this. Across the world, the
            economic collapse of the 1930s brought social malaise and political
            destabilisation. Britain’s success and prosperity averted these, and
            left it to face crisis and war in a position of strength, unity and
            confidence. The international situation today is not so grave as it
            was then. But the future is always perilous, and it is vital that
            Britain should once more have the strength and self-belief of 1939
            with which to play its part in the leadership of the free world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The good news is that the hardest things to create are ours already.
            No government can legislate into being a respect for the rule of
            law, appetite for scientific discovery and entrepreneurship, or
            tolerance of eccentricity and debate. Such a culture takes centuries
            to build: it is the most precious inheritance that we have received
            from the generations that went before us. By comparison, what we
            must do is surprisingly simple: get Britain building by removing
            barriers and lowering costs. If we can establish these foundations,
            growth and dynamism will follow. We have done this before. We can do
            it again.
