		<p>On Saturday evening, <a href="https://decripto.org/it/arrestato-a-parigi-il-fondatore-di-telegram-pavel-durov-preso-in-custodia-dai-servizi-segreti/">Pavel Durov</a>, founder and CEO of Telegram, was arrested at Le Bourget airport in Paris. The arrest took place as Durov, accompanied by his bodyguard and a woman, stepped off a private jet that had arrived from Azerbaijan. The arrest was made on the basis of a French search warrant issued by the National Directorate of Judicial Police, following a preliminary investigation. Durov was placed on a federal wanted list and the warrant was issued because of his alleged failure to cooperate with the French authorities.</p>


<p>Durov is accused of numerous serious crimes, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Terrorism</strong></li>



<li><strong>Drug trafficking</strong></li>



<li><strong>Complicity in criminal activities</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fraud</strong></li>



<li><strong>Money laundering</strong></li>



<li><strong>Concealment of illegal activities</strong></li>



<li><strong>Distribution of child sexual abuse content</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>French authorities believe that Telegram, under Durov’s leadership, became a major platform for organised crime due to its encrypted messaging services, which allegedly facilitated illegal activities. Investigators have taken Durov into custody and he is expected to be brought before a judge soon. The seriousness of the charges could lead to a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.</p>


<p><strong>Impact on the crypto TON</strong></p>


<p>The arrest had an immediate impact on the cryptocurrency market. Toncoin, the cryptocurrency associated with Telegram, fell significantly, dropping more than 15% on the markets after the news of the arrest.</p>


<p><strong>The European Union’s accusations</strong></p>


<p>The main accusation by EU authorities concerns Telegram’s encrypted messaging services, which were allegedly used to facilitate organised crime. One investigator stated that ‘Telegram has become the number one platform for organised crime over the years’, underlining the perceived link between the platform’s privacy features and criminal activities.</p>


<p><strong>Durov is French: he will face trial in France</strong></p>


<p>As a French citizen, Durov will be tried in France and will have to answer to the charges against him. The case could have major legal repercussions and influence the regulation of digital platforms and cryptocurrencies in the future.</p>
