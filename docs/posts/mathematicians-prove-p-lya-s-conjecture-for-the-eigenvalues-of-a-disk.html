</div><p>Is it possible to deduce the shape of a drum from the sounds it makes? This is the kind of question that Iosif Polterovich, a professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Université de Montréal, likes to ask. Polterovich uses spectral geometry, a branch of mathematics, to understand physical phenomena involving wave propagation.</p>

																					<p>Last summer, Polterovich and his international collaborators—Nikolay Filonov, Michael Levitin and David Sher—proved a special case of a famous conjecture in spectral geometry formulated in 1954 by the eminent Hungarian-American mathematician George Pólya.</p>
<p>The conjecture bears on the estimation of the frequencies of a round drum or, in mathematical terms, the eigenvalues of a disk.</p>
<p>Pólya himself confirmed his conjecture in 1961 for domains that tile a plane, such as triangles and rectangles. Until last year, the conjecture was known only for these cases. The disk, despite its apparent simplicity, remained elusive.</p>
<p>&#34;Imagine an infinite floor covered with tiles of the same shape that fit together to fill the space,&#34; Polterovich said. &#34;It can be tiled with squares or triangles, but not with disks. A disk is actually not a good shape for tiling.&#34;</p>
<h2>The universality of mathematics</h2>
<p>In an article <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-023-01198-1">published</a> in the mathematical journal <i>Inventiones Mathematicae</i>, the researchers show that Pólya&#39;s conjecture is true for the disk, a case considered particularly challenging.</p>
<p>Though their result is essentially of theoretical value, their proof method has applications in <a href="https://phys.org/tags/computational+mathematics/" rel="tag">computational mathematics</a> and numerical computation. The authors are now investigating this avenue.</p>
<p>&#34;While mathematics is a fundamental science, it is similar to sports and the arts in some ways,&#34; Polterovich said.</p>
<p>&#34;Trying to prove a long-standing <a href="https://phys.org/tags/conjecture/" rel="tag">conjecture</a> is a sport. Finding an elegant solution is an art. And in many cases, beautiful mathematical discoveries do turn out to be useful—you just have to find the right application.&#34;</p>
