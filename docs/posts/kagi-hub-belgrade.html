    <h1>Kagi Hub Belgrade</h1>

            <p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-21/1763741331-28722-kagihubcover-3.png" alt="An ilustration of an office room with a Doggo, Cat and Kagibara"/></p>

<p>We’re excited to announce that <a href="https://hub.kagi.com">Kagi Hub Belgrade</a> is now open!
Our first office doubles as a free coworking space for all Kagi members. Reservations will be available from December 15th, and you can make your bookings <a href="https://hub.kagi.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>Kagi Hub is our first physical home: a modern, light-filled, 250-square-meter office space in the very heart of Belgrade, Serbia, open to all Kagi members and the Kagi team. Yes, you read that right. You can share this space with us!</p>

<p>Why? Great products don’t happen in isolation. They are shaped by the people who use them. That’s what this space is for: a place where Kagi users and our team members can share feedback, ideas, and a cup of coffee in person. Kagi Hub is an extension of our mission to humanize the web, creating an offline space where people who care about a better internet can meet.</p>

<h2>Who can use the Hub (and what you get)</h2>

<p>Alongside Kagi employees, Kagi Hub is free for all Kagi members. Each member can book up to 5 days per month at no additional cost.</p>

<p>The open space has 25 dedicated seats. Once you complete the booking, you’ll get a spot in the open-space area for the dates you’ve chosen (first-come, first-served within your booking) → <a href="https://hub.kagi.com">Kagi Hub Belgrade</a>.</p>

<p>At the hub you’ll find:</p>

<ul>
<li>A quiet, modern open-space work area with 25 ergonomic desks</li>
<li>Fast Wi‑Fi</li>
<li>Free coffee, tea, and a small kitchen area</li>
<li>A conference room, subject to availability</li>
</ul>

<p>We kindly ask you to cancel your booking if you can’t make it, so other members can use the space.</p>

<h2>Where to find us</h2>

<p><strong>Address</strong>:
Kneza Mihaila 11, first floor
11000 Belgrade, Serbia</p>

<p><strong>Opening hours</strong>:
Monday - Friday, 10:00–19:00 (local time), excluding local public holidays.</p>

<h2>Why Belgrade?</h2>

<p>We could have put our first hub in San Francisco, Tokyo, or Berlin. We chose Belgrade on purpose.</p>

<p>Belgrade sits at the crossroads of East and West, with many short direct flights from cities like Vienna, London, Lisbon, Split, Barcelona, and Paris. It has a thriving tech and startup scene, with a growing talent pool. It’s known for its walkable neighborhoods, great party scene, and generous hospitality.</p>

<p>Above all, it’s a place where our founder and CEO, Vlad, lived and built for over 30 years before moving to the USA. It’s a place where we already have a few Kagi employees and are very eager to welcome you and show you around.</p>

<h2>See you there!</h2>

<p>Kagi Hub in Belgrade is our first experiment in bringing the Kagi movement into the physical world. If it works the way we hope, it won’t be the last. Local tech media have already welcomed Kagi Hub as part of a bigger shift: an internet that doesn’t revolve around advertising, tracking, and engagement-at-any-cost.
