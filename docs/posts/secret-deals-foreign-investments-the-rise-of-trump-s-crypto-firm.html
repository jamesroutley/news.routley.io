    <h1>Secret Deals, Foreign Investments: The Rise of Trump’s Crypto Firm</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The pitch from “ZMoney” arrived on the encrypted messaging app Signal just days before Donald J. Trump’s presidential inauguration.</p><p>“ZMoney” was Zachary Folkman, an entrepreneur who once ran a company called Date Hotter Girls and was now representing World Liberty Financial, the cryptocurrency firm that Mr. Trump and his sons had recently unveiled. Mr. Folkman was writing to a crypto startup in the Cayman Islands, offering a “partnership” in which the firms would buy each other’s digital coins, a deal that would bolster the startup’s public profile.</p><p>But there was a catch, The New York Times found. For the privilege of associating with the Trumps, the startup would have to make, in effect, a secret multimillion dollar payment to World Liberty.</p><p>“Everything we do gets a lot of exposure and credibility,” Mr. Folkman wrote, asserting that other business partners had committed between $10 million and $30 million to World Liberty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Cayman startup rejected the offer, as did several other firms that received a similar pitch from World Liberty, executives said. They considered the deal unethical, concluding that World Liberty was essentially selling an endorsement — and hiding the arrangement from the public.</p><p>World Liberty’s executives, who have maintained that they did nothing improper, were undeterred. They successfully pitched similar deals to other firms while also marketing their coin to buyers around the world, reaping more than $550 million in sales, with a large cut earmarked for the president’s family.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s return to the White House has opened lucrative <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/trump-organization-ethics-policy-foreign-deals.html" title="">new pathways for him to cash in on his power</a>, whether through his social media company or new overseas real estate deals. But none of the Trump family’s other business endeavors pose conflicts of interest that compare to those that have emerged since the birth of World Liberty.</p><p>The firm, <a href="https://www.worldlibertyfinancial.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largely</a> owned by a Trump <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/8793b04e9c73c074/273dbca8-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">family corporate entity</a>, has erased centuries-old presidential norms, eviscerating the boundary between private enterprise and government policy in a manner without precedent in modern American history.</p><p>Mr. Trump is now not only a major crypto dealer; he is also the industry’s top policy maker. So far in his second term, Mr. Trump has leveraged his presidential powers in ways that have benefited the industry — and in some cases his own company — even though he had spent years deriding crypto as a haven for drug dealers and scammers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He has filled his administration with sympathizers to the crypto cause, including by appointing a former adviser to industry players as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the Justice Department recently disbanded a crypto crimes task force, continuing a broader unwinding of Biden-era scrutiny of the industry.</p><p>A Times examination of World Liberty’s rapid ascent from fledgling startup to international force — and Mr. Trump’s conversion from crypto skeptic to industry cheerleader — highlights the range of conflicts of interest trailing the company:</p><ul><li><p>World Liberty has directly benefited from Mr. Trump’s official actions, such as his announcement of a federal crypto stockpile that would include a digital currency the firm has invested in. The president’s announcement caused a temporary jump in the value of World Liberty’s holdings.</p></li><li><p>World Liberty has sold its cryptocurrency to investors abroad, including in Israel and Hong Kong, according to interviews and data obtained by The Times, establishing a new avenue for foreign businesses to try to curry favor with Mr. Trump.</p></li><li><p>Several investors in World Liberty’s coin managed firms that the federal government accused of wrongdoing. They include an executive whose fraud case was suspended after he invested millions of dollars in World Liberty. Other investors and business partners, some of whom haven’t been publicly identified before, are looking to expand in ways that will require the Trump administration’s approval.</p></li><li><p>World Liberty proposed swapping cryptocurrencies with at least five start-ups, and often used the Trump name to solicit steep payments as part of the deals. Even in an industry with a disreputable history, the deals raised alarm among veteran executives.</p></li></ul><p>“It’s a black spot on our industry,” said Andre Cronje, a founder of SonicLabs, a crypto firm that turned down World Liberty’s pitch. Anyone who accepted would “obviously think they’re going to make money because it’s the officially endorsed Trump project.”</p><p>A spokesman for World Liberty, David Wachsman, disputed that any of the company’s deals constituted a “one-sided payment for services rendered.” But he acknowledged that the company has engaged in “mutual investment deals,” and said that its deal-making had resulted in “thoughtful, strategic exchanges between parties who stand to mutually benefit.”</p><p>Mr. Wachsman also said it would be “false, absurd and dangerous to suggest that investments or partnerships with World Liberty Financial were conducted as some sort of political quid pro quo.”</p><p>“Never has an investor or partner requested any political favoritism,” he said. “Nor would we ever entertain such a possibility.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Still, the company’s deal-making benefits the president’s family. A Trump business entity owns 60 percent of World Liberty, according to the company’s <a href="https://www.worldlibertyfinancial.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website,</a> and is entitled to 75 percent of certain revenue from coin sales, which could be converted into cash.</p><p>“It’s one of the more successful things we’ve ever done,” Eric Trump, the president’s son who runs the family business, said in an interview this month at the Trump Doral golf course in Florida.</p><p>He and his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., are <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2043140/000204314024000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actively involved</a> in World Liberty, though they rely on three partners to oversee the daily operations. Two of them, Mr. Folkman and Chase Herro, have a mixed track record in crypto. The other is Zach Witkoff, the son of Mr. Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who is also a World Liberty <a href="https://static.worldlibertyfinancial.com/docs/intl/gold-paper.pdf#page=10" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">founder.</a></p><p>In recent days, Zach Witkoff, Mr. Folkman and Mr. Herro were in Pakistan <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShehbazSharif/posts/a-delegation-of-the-american-financing-company-world-liberty-financial-called-on/1290902729071968/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">meeting with the country’s prime minister, Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif</a>, and other top government officials to discuss World Liberty. The trip, <a href="https://x.com/worldlibertyfi/status/1916854960399974419" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">complete with limousines</a>, a dance performance and police escorts, seamlessly blended the president’s business interests with the trappings of a state visit. (Mr. Wachsman said no U.S. government officials were involved in the meetings.)</p><p>President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/us/politics/trump-organization-ivanka-trump.html" title="">has noted</a> that conflict of interest laws do not apply to him, and that he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/supreme-courts-immunity-ruling-echo.html" title="">broad immunity</a> for official actions he takes as president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In a statement, a spokeswoman for President Trump noted that his “assets are in a trust managed by his children,” and that as a result, “there are no conflicts of interest.” (The trust still benefits President Trump directly.)</p><p>World Liberty’s supporters are unbothered by questions about conflicts.</p><p>“Trump wants to make a lot of money in crypto,” Konstantin Kuznetsov, a Russian citizen living in Miami whose <a href="https://www.tenzor.capital/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gibraltar-based firm</a> bought $1 million of World Liberty’s coins, said in an interview. “We can join in this wave.”</p><h2 id="link-1c18eaf2">Chief Crypto Advocate</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/us/politics/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/us/politics/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/us/politics/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="An illustration of Trump Tower with a stack of gold coins above the doorway." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/us/politics/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/us/politics/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/us/politics/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/us/politics/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1/28DC-CRYPTO-sub1-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/bfb01955-fda9-58c6-99b3-821fc7d73102" decoding="async" width="600" height="600"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Illustration by Ricardo Tomás; Photograph by George Clerk via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As a businessman who made his name in the tactile world of real estate, Donald Trump never aspired to build a digital coin empire.</p><p>Indeed, at the end of his first term, Mr. Trump turned to social media to express disdain for cryptocurrencies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>They “<a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are not money</a>,” he warned.

And for a long period of time, I had access to everyone in the world,” Donald Trump Jr. explained in a live video appearance at a crypto conference in Washington last month. “All of a sudden that became really difficult.

Under the Biden administration, the industry had faced nearly 100 enforcement actions by the S.E.C., and crypto executives wanted a leader to champion their interests in Washington.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>During his campaign stumps, Mr. Trump’s qualms about crypto appeared to vanish. At a Bitcoin conference in July, he vowed to turn the United States into the “crypto capital of the planet.”</p><hr/><p><strong>Bitcoin</strong></p><p>Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and still the most valuable by far. At current prices, one Bitcoin is worth about $94,000.</p><hr/><p>Two months later, Mr. Trump completed his conversion, announcing that he and his sons would enter the crypto marketplace with a new venture called World Liberty Financial.</p><p>Mr. Trump delivered the news in a livestream at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where he had gathered with Eric and Donald Jr., along with Mr. Herro and Mr. Folkman.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“Crypto is one of those things we have to do,” Mr. Trump said. “Whether we like it or not, I have to do it.”</p><p>Mr. Herro and Mr. Folkman were unusual choices to partner with a president.</p><p>Mr. Folkman, who has short curly hair and tattoos, ran a company in his 20s tutoring forlorn men on how to pick up women. In numerous podcast appearances, Mr. Herro has recounted his life’s redemption arc, describing a wild youth in which he was charged with marijuana possession and spent a couple of weeks in a Wisconsin jail.</p><p>The two men had worked together for years, selling everything from colon cleanses to get-rich-quick advice, before pivoting to crypto with uneven results.</p><p>In 2022, Mr. Herro <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/donald-trump-crypto-2024-campaign.html" title="">urged</a> a roomful of crypto enthusiasts to invest in the currency TerraUSD, calling it “one of the coolest assets in history.” The coin imploded a month later, erasing billions of dollars in wealth. Mr. Herro’s most recent venture with Mr. Folkman was a crypto platform called Dough Finance, which was hacked in July, leading to the theft of $2 million.</p><p>It’s not clear exactly how the pair earned the Trumps’ trust. But Steve Witkoff said last year that he met them through his son, and then introduced them to the family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>On the livestream introducing World Liberty, Donald Trump Jr. hailed the men as first-class financial minds.</p><p>“You could put them in a boardroom at Goldman Sachs, and they’re going to smoke the people in the room,” he said.</p><p>In October, Mr. Herro and Mr. Folkman got to work on the company’s first initiative — selling a new cryptocurrency, which it called $WLFI, with the goal of $300 million in sales.</p><p>These coins would be different from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/technology/trump-private-dinner-crypto-memecoin.html" title="">$TRUMP</a> — the so-called memecoin that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/trump-crypto-memecoin.html" title="">spiked</a> in January after Mr. Trump marketed it to his followers before it abruptly crashed.</p><hr/><p><strong>Memecoin</strong></p><p>A memecoin is a type of cryptocurrency based on an online joke or celebrity mascot.

Anyone who bought the $WLFI coins would get to vote on certain bank business decisions like shareholders in a traditional company.</p><p>Mr. Trump was at the core of the pitch. The company published a 13-page <a href="https://static.worldlibertyfinancial.com/docs/intl/gold-paper.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Gold Paper”</a> that described its mission and leadership team. On the cover was a portrait of Mr. Trump, styled to look as if gold paint had been splashed across the page.</p><p>He would serve as the company’s “Chief Crypto Advocate,” the paper said.</p><p>When World Liberty launched, the Trump family and its affiliates were given 22.5 billion units of the crypto coins — a stash now worth at least $1.1 billion on paper, depending on the various prices used in recent sales.</p><p>Under the company’s rules, the Trumps and other World Liberty investors are not allowed to sell their coins on the open market, though the company <a href="https://static.worldlibertyfinancial.com/docs/intl/gold-paper.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has said</a> it might eventually lift that restriction if other buyers of the coin agree.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Initially, there were few buyers.

But World Liberty has said it performs extensive checks on investors in its coin, so it knows who they are.</p><hr/><p><strong>Blockchain</strong></p><p>The blockchain<strong> </strong>is the publicly viewable ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Every time someone spends money with a digital coin, it shows up as an entry, allowing investigators to track the flow of funds. In most cases, the identities of the buyers and sellers are concealed behind strings of letters and numbers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><hr/><p>An analysis performed for The Times by the forensics firm Nansen, drawing on crypto industry data, showed that many of the investors were based abroad in places like Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Federal law prevents foreigners from donating to presidential campaigns or inaugural funds, but World Liberty’s coin sale offered a new, legal way to back Mr. Trump.</p><p>“The main reason for purchasing such a token was to support Trump’s inauguration, as he was the first crypto-friendly president of the United States,” said Keer Lau, chief strategy officer at Orbiter Finance, a Hong Kong-based entity.</p><p>Some investors, domestic and overseas, have managed firms that ran afoul of U.S. regulations. One was Yoni Assia, an Israeli who founded eToro, an online trading platform whose U.S. subsidiary reached a $<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-125" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1.5 million</a> settlement with the S.E.C. last year for crypto-related violations. Troy Murray, a Puerto Rico-based investor, also bought World Liberty’s coin. Before that, he had helped create BarnBridge, which in late 2023 agreed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-258#:~:text=To%20settle%20the%20SEC%27s%20charges,pay%20a%20%24125%2C000%20civil%20penalties." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to pay the S.E.C. $1.7 million</a> to settle its own crypto-related accusations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Since Mr. Trump took office, some World Liberty investors have pushed the government for regulatory approvals, or are poised to interact with the administration as they try to build or expand businesses in the United States.</p><p>In March, Mr. Assia’s company <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1493318/000101376225001589/ea0223534-08.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notified</a> the S.E.C. that it intended to go public in the United States.

Not long after, Mr. Sun made another headline-grabbing maneuver: He <a href="https://x.com/justinsuntron/status/1861121947372773545" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spent</a> $75 <a href="https://x.com/justinsuntron/status/1881169556506546485" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">million</a> on $WLFI coins.</p><p>The investment <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_trump_administration_on_corruption.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drew widespread criticism</a> given that Mr. Sun had a clear incentive to gain favor with the Trump White House. During the Biden administration, the S.E.C. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-59" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sued</a> Mr. Sun, arguing that he had fraudulently inflated the price of a Tron cryptocurrency.</p><p>Mr. Sun has denied the S.E.C.’s charges, and in a text message to The Times last year, he said his World Liberty investment was simply a vote of confidence in the Trump family’s “excellent project.”</p><p>In late February, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67071330/82/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-sun/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the S.E.C.</a> asked a federal judge to halt proceedings in Mr. Sun’s case: The agency said it was exploring “a potential resolution.” <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.596044/gov.uscourts.nysd.596044.83.0_1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The judge granted the stay</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><h2 id="link-7f051c01">The Stars Align</h2><p>Justin Sun gave World Liberty a big lift. But Mr. Trump’s company wanted more money. Much more.</p><p>So World Liberty executives soon announced what they called “a <a href="https://x.com/worldlibertyfi/status/1889429781512409346" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transformative initiative</a>” to partner with other crypto outfits and invest in their coins. The strategy, the executives said in February, would leverage World Liberty’s growing clout to help their lesser-known partners.</p><p>“It’s like taking care of your brother in the space,” Mr. Herro said at a crypto event in New York that month.</p><p>But World Liberty’s public pronouncements omitted a key aspect of its private pitch to several crypto startups, executives at these companies told The Times. World Liberty wanted to sell its own coin — not just to invest in others’. It was proposing a currency swap.</p><p>Here is the deal World Liberty offered, according to executives at three crypto firms approached by the company: The startups would spend between $10 million and $30 million on a large chunk of World Liberty’s coins. In return, World Liberty would buy a smaller amount of each startup’s own cryptocurrency.
