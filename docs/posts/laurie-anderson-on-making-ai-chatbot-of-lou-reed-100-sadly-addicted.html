    <h1>Laurie Anderson on making AI chatbot of Lou Reed: 100%, sadly addicted</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p><span>T</span>here’s a 2013 Black Mirror episode in which a young widow played by Hayley Atwell signs up to an online service that scrapes a person’s entire digital footprint to create a virtual simulation. She soon starts chatting online with her late husband (Domhnall Gleeson), before things inevitably get Black Mirror-y.</p><p>Laurie Anderson, the American avant garde artist, musician and thinker, hasn’t seen the episode but, in the last few years, has lived a version of it: growing hopelessly hooked on an AI text generator that emulates the vocabulary and style of her own longtime partner and collaborator, Velvet Underground co-founder Lou Reed, who died in 2013.</p><p>“People are like, ‘Wow, you were so prescient; I didn’t even know what you were <em>talking</em> about back then’,” she says on a video call from New York.</p><p>A new Anderson exhibition, I’ll Be Your Mirror, has just opened in Adelaide, where Anderson will be doing an <a href="https://www.adelaidefestival.com.au/events/2024-writers-week/in-conversation-with-laurie-anderson/" data-link-name="in body link">In Conversation event</a> via live stream on Wednesday 6 March. The last time Anderson was in Australia, in March 2020, she spent a week working with the University of Adelaide’s Australian Institute for Machine Learning. Before the pandemic forced her to catch one of the last flights home, they had been exploring language-based AI models and their artistic possibilities, drawing on Anderson’s body of written work.</p><p>In one experiment, they fed a vast cache of Reed’s writing, songs and interviews into the machine. A decade after his death, the resulting algorithm lets Anderson type in prompts before an AI Reed begins “riffing” written responses back to her, in prose and verse.</p><figure id="b0bc38c9-bbb5-4cc2-81d4-d7fd9a2d64e1" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="305.38125" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed in Spain in 2009.</span> Photograph: Robin Towsend/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>“I’m totally 100%, sadly addicted to this,” she laughs. “I still am, after all this time. I kind of literally just can’t stop doing it, and my friends just can’t stand it – ‘You’re not doing that again are you?’</p><p>“I mean, I really do not think I’m talking to my dead husband and writing songs with him – I really don’t. But people have styles, and they can be replicated.”</p><p>The results, Anderson says, can be hit and miss. “Three-quarters of it is just completely idiotic and stupid. And then maybe 15% is like, ‘Oh?’. And then the rest is pretty interesting. And that’s a pretty good ratio for writing, I think.”</p><p>On her side of the call, Anderson starts typing. “You know what, I’ll just bring it up right now while we’re talking and you can give me a phrase.”</p><p>Looking at the morning traffic outside my window, I offer the very mundane, “bus idling on the street”. She feeds it in as we keep talking.</p><hr/><figure id="6d83a7b0-8b9d-4943-a35a-f1933c0597b1" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09e6346c1c490eb1dd7b3da1b38f3fb585cc188/0_0_4480_6720/master/4480.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09e6346c1c490eb1dd7b3da1b38f3fb585cc188/0_0_4480_6720/master/4480.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09e6346c1c490eb1dd7b3da1b38f3fb585cc188/0_0_4480_6720/master/4480.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09e6346c1c490eb1dd7b3da1b38f3fb585cc188/0_0_4480_6720/master/4480.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09e6346c1c490eb1dd7b3da1b38f3fb585cc188/0_0_4480_6720/master/4480.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09e6346c1c490eb1dd7b3da1b38f3fb585cc188/0_0_4480_6720/master/4480.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09e6346c1c490eb1dd7b3da1b38f3fb585cc188/0_0_4480_6720/master/4480.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09e6346c1c490eb1dd7b3da1b38f3fb585cc188/0_0_4480_6720/master/4480.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09e6346c1c490eb1dd7b3da1b38f3fb585cc188/0_0_4480_6720/master/4480.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09e6346c1c490eb1dd7b3da1b38f3fb585cc188/0_0_4480_6720/master/4480.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Laurie Anderson in 2023" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09e6346c1c490eb1dd7b3da1b38f3fb585cc188/0_0_4480_6720/master/4480.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="667.5" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘I really do not think I’m talking to my dead husband … but people have styles, and they can be replicated.’</span> Photograph: Stephanie Diani</figcaption></figure><p>Back in 2020, Anderson said the institute’s work was “like collaborating with the biggest brain you could imagine”.</p><p>This was before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chatgpt" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">ChatGPT</a> and Midjourney, when for most people AI remained a far-off concept without mainstream applications – just fodder for sci-fi.</p><p>These newer developments have brought fresh creative, ethical and legal questions, from concerns over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/18/ethics-ai-porn" data-link-name="in body link">AI porn</a> to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/28/australian-books-training-ai-books3-stolen-pirated" data-link-name="in body link"> copyrighted works being used without permission</a>, to “fake” songs made by<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/19/arts/music/ai-drake-the-weeknd-fake.html" data-link-name="in body link"> digital doppelgangers of real, living artists such as Drake and the Weeknd</a>.</p><p>Some of Anderson’s peers have been scathing; confronted with lyrics written in his own style by ChatGPT, Nick Cave dismissed it as “a grotesque mockery”.

In many ways, there they <em>are</em>. You can say that about Dostoevsky, Plato, you know, <em>the Buddha</em>. People leave things around, and so I feel fine about that. I mean, we’re just mayflies, really.”</p><p>When the ghost in the machine has finished thinking, it serves up some fresh Lou Reed-ish lyrics inspired by my bus stop:</p><blockquote>
 <p><em>The street and the sky</em></p>
</blockquote><p>I ask if Reed referenced “quilting” a lot in his writing, and Anderson laughs with her usual mix of playful and profound:</p><p>“Hah, I think that might be the first time.”</p><ul>
