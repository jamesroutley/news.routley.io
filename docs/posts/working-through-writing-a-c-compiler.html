    <h1>Working through &#39;Writing A C Compiler&#39;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Some time ago I decided I wanted to create a c compiler for the Hack processor in the nand2tetris book. After several dead end attempts that I might describe later I found this book : <a href="https://nostarch.com/writing-c-compiler">Writing a C Compiler | No Starch Press</a></p>

<p>I decided to work my way through it. I plan to do blog posts as I progress through it, probably chapter by chapter.</p>



<p>I have emailed the author a couple of times and have got helpful timely replies! â€“ thank you</p>



<p>What makes the book so good?</p>



<h2>Step by step</h2>



<p>By the end of chapter 1 you have a working compiler. Each subsequent chapter adds more features. The chapter 1 compiler can only handle</p>



<pre><code>int main(void){
    return &lt;constant&gt;;
}</code></pre>



<p>But it works producing a complete executable</p>



<p>Chapter 2 adds unary operators so we can now do something like.</p>



<pre><code>int main(void){
    return ~3;
}</code></pre>



<p>This contrasts with most other books I have worked with on compilers like the also excellent <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a> and <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">Home | nand2tetris</a> </p>



<p>The fact that we are building a real language as opposed to a made up one is great too.</p>



<p>Side note: Some c features are not implemented in the book but are suggested as â€˜extra creditâ€™. I intend to implement all those. Some features are not implemented and are not covered. More on those later.</p>



<h2>Test suite</h2>



<p>The other great thing is that there is a large test suite provided. For each chapter tests are added so running the , say, chapter 5 tests runs the tests for 1,2,3 and 4 as well. </p>



<p>You can say if you want to test:</p>



<ul>
<li>extra credit features </li>



<li>just the lexer pass</li>



<li>the lex and parser pass</li>



<li>semantic analysis</li>



<li>everything</li>
</ul>



<p>Even the simple compiler in chapter 1 has 24 tests</p>



<p>This is a tremendous resource and seeing the test suite say </p>



<pre><code>PS C:\work\forks\writing-a-c-compiler-tests&gt; python .\test_compiler C:\work\mycc\target\debug\mycc.exe --chapter 1 --extra-credit
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 24 tests in 2.843s

OK</code></pre>



<p>is a real pleasure. Time to fire up gitui (<a href="https://github.com/gitui-org/gitui">gitui-org/gitui: Blazing ðŸ’¥ fast terminal-ui for git written in rust ðŸ¦€</a>) and commit </p>



<h2>Repos</h2>



<p>Nora has two github repos for this book</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nlsandler/writing-a-c-compiler-tests">nlsandler/writing-a-c-compiler-tests: Test cases for Writing a C Compiler</a> this is the test suite</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/nlsandler/nqcc2">nlsandler/nqcc2: Reference implementation for Writing a C Compiler</a> this is an ocaml implementation of the compiler. It does not implement the extra credit features</li>
</ul>



<p>I have two as well</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pm100/writing-a-c-compiler-tests">pm100/writing-a-c-compiler-tests: Test cases for Writing a C Compiler</a> a fork of the original with a few changes and bug fixes. Mainly to do with Windows support (see later post)</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/pm100/mycc">pm100/mycc</a> my implementation in rust. Like the nqcc2 repo it has (mainly) a commit per chapter</li>
</ul>



<h2>Posts</h2>



<p>I will probably do one blog post per chapter, including one for the introduction. I got to the extra credit section of chapter 8 before I thought of blogging the process. So there will be a bunch of posts in a rush, that cover completed work and will be in the past tense. As I move forward, they will be chattier as I debate with myself how to do things, and spread out to the pace of my progress</p>



<h2>Final Note</h2>



<p>This is a great book. Any comments I make in later chapter regarding things that I think are missing, wrong, confusing etc. should not take away from the fact that this is an extremely good book.</p>
