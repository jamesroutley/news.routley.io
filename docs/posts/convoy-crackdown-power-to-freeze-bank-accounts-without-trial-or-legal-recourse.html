    <h1>Convoy Crackdown – power to freeze bank accounts without trial or legal recourse</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div><div dir="auto"><p>The convoy has been dispersed. Yet Tyler Cowen was clearly correct that this will be a very important event. The story has barely begun. </p><p>[Writer’s Note: This post violates some of the usual lines that I set for myself regarding politics, because I do not know how to communicate the situation without doing so, nor does it seem like a situation one can safely ignore. I did my best to keep it to a minimum. As before, I will be staying out of the comments, and ask that related discussions be confined to related posts and conducted to minimize the political component, but I acknowledge that this may not be fully possible in this case and will use discretion.]</p><p>Previously in <a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/convoy" rel="">Convoy</a> and <a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/convoy-continued" rel="">Convoy Continued</a>, the puzzle was what was happening and what might happen next in response. Authorities were uncertain what to do. The situation was somewhat out of control. Violence was a distinct possibility, or at least the fear of such violence was informing decisions and rhetoric. There were big disputes over the essential nature of the protest, the protesters, <a href="https://www.econlib.org/janet-bufton-on-the-canadian-truckers-protest/" rel="">what they wanted and why they were there</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/dick_nixon/status/1494725065878945807" rel="">As far as I could tell the protests were unpopular</a> but that too was disputed. Every edit seemed like it reflected more information from more sources, but more often that not that only meant increased uncertainty. </p><p>Most of that is now resolved. The convoy has been broken up by police without incident and with zero violence (or at least, zero violence that didn’t involve police acting like police usually act), only minor <a href="https://twitter.com/OttawaBylaw/status/1494306645274509316" rel="">threats to permanently confiscate people’s dogs</a>, in exactly the most basic and obvious way. A few people are still hanging around, but they no longer threaten public order. The three leaders have been arrested. When one engages in civil disobedience and makes oneself intentionally obstructing traffic for weeks, <a href="https://twitter.com/ASFleischman/status/1494697226416934915" rel="">one eventually gets arrested and faces the consequences</a> of being briefly in jail and having a record, and perhaps more if one committed more serious crimes and the state can convince a jury of that. That’s how it’s supposed to work. There were less than 200 arrests and they towed less than 50 trucks. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f27zNlmRMWU&amp;ab_channel=carrieunderwoodVEVO" rel="">There’s just one little problem.</a></p><p>Before breaking up the protest, as I noted last time, Prime Minister Trudeau<a id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" rel="">1</a>  invoked the Emergencies Act. </p><p>The Emergencies Act may have been a little bit about the need to commandeer towing capacity, but we can now be very certain what it was centrally about.</p><p>It was about money. </p><p>In particular, it was about giving the government of Canada the <em>permanent </em>power to freeze, without trial or legal recourse, all the bank accounts and other assets of anyone it decides was ‘directly or indirectly involved’ in an ‘illegal protest.’  In practice this translates to ‘freeze the assets <em>of the families </em>of anyone that power or the government dislikes.’ </p><p>In particular, this clip makes it very clear that <a href="https://twitter.com/ATabarrok/status/1494381498555781122" rel="">it is intended to include </a><em><a href="https://twitter.com/ATabarrok/status/1494381498555781122" rel="">anyone who donated to either of their crowdfunding campaigns.</a> </em>If you give the wrong amount of money to support a protest the Canadian government decides it dislikes, <a href="https://www.econlib.org/are-your-views-canadian-government-approved/" rel="">they may well freeze your bank accounts and you will have no recourse even if it was in error</a>. In that clip they also say that they are doing this without the Democratic process in part ‘because an opposition party exists to frustrate any government attempt to pass legislation.’  </p><p>In pursuit of this, they have tasked not only the banks but a wide variety of payment processors and others who handle money, including those handling cryptocurrency, with spying on their customers to determine which ones participated in activities disapproved of by power or the government, and freezing their accounts. </p><p>If one’s accounts are frozen and one is both left without resources and without the ability to transact, it is<em> at best</em> <em>extremely difficult</em> to participate in society. One cannot easily hold a job or raise a family, <a href="https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1494666632102395918" rel="">and buying a tomato may prove tricky.</a> </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F261bc0e8-1ade-4f39-b7ab-d065049e85d2_666x288.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F261bc0e8-1ade-4f39-b7ab-d065049e85d2_666x288.png" width="666" height="288" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/261bc0e8-1ade-4f39-b7ab-d065049e85d2_666x288.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:288,&#34;width&#34;:666,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:50471,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><p>Family members having trouble living their lives is being treated not as a bug but as a feature. The sins of the father are to be laid upon the children, it seems. </p><p>This extends as noted above to those who <em>provide financial assistance </em>to those engaging in disapproved activities, and that such retaliation will continue to happen <em>after the activities in question cease, </em>so not only is one without one’s money and other assets, and without the ability to spend what one does have, others may reasonably fear that helping you not end up on the street might land them in the same situation.</p><p>Meanwhile, our systems are moving steadily away from cash or any other way to pay for things if one’s accounts are frozen, including <em>the mortgage or the rent. </em>Ending up losing everything is a real possibility. </p><p>Again, this is happening in many cases without anyone ever being charged with any crime. Even when crimes are charged, even if the government gets convictions, the punishment here is orders of magnitude out of line and sets the worst kind of precedent. If such folks are guilty of treason or rebellion or terrorism, <em>then charge them with that </em>and see what a jury has to say. </p><p>As for those who vote against this policy, here’s what Justin Trudeau has to say, <a href="https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1495803301736103937" rel="">notice what things he </a><em><a href="https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1495803301736103937" rel="">totally does not sound like at all, no sir</a> (</em>video is at the link, 38sec).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9757633c-8675-4ca9-92b6-e3ced339e6a7_579x449.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9757633c-8675-4ca9-92b6-e3ced339e6a7_579x449.png" width="579" height="449" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9757633c-8675-4ca9-92b6-e3ced339e6a7_579x449.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:449,&#34;width&#34;:579,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:196987,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><h2>Freedom to Transact</h2><p><strong><a href="https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/02/free-to-transact.html" rel="">Without the freedom to transact there is no freedom.</a></strong><a href="https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/02/free-to-transact.html" rel=""> </a></p><p>This is the reality that Canada, and perhaps soon the rest of the world, now faces. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1494444624630403083" rel="">This thread is long</a> (<a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1494444624630403083.html" rel="">thread unroller version here</a>), but it is important.

It was still plausible that however awful the precedent set by the financial authoritarianism and disregard for the rule of law, that one could be sufficiently terrified of a physical solution to think that such actions were <em>necessary </em>or at least <em>useful. </em></p><p>I was already confident of quite the opposite. Taking these actions galvanized people’s worst fears throughout not only Canada but the world. However much forceful dissent and distrust of the system was present before, it will doubtless be <em>much, much </em>more present going forward. The only way that is in the government’s interest is if <em>it wants this fight </em>in order to further suspend freedom and democracy and destroy the rule of law that much faster. </p><p>To the extent these people are capable of having points at all, the suspension of freedom and democracy and the destruction of rule of law <em>is the point. </em><a href="https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1494666632102395918" rel="">Setting a precedent that the government can cast out your entire family and anyone helping you on a whim </a><em><a href="https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1494666632102395918" rel="">is the point.</a> </em></p><p>How can I be confident that we know this?</p><p>The protests were broken up only days later by arresting those present and towing trucks.

What else in the world could this be referring to? Is this a permanent emergency because people might try something again at some point in the future? Or was the thing that required the act the institution of these financial measures on a permanent basis? </p><p>Part of my explanation for this is <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/12/15/motive-ambiguity/" rel="">motive ambiguity</a>. One shows one’s dedication to the cause by intentionally inflicting maximum harm, thus proving one is not going to be distracted by worries about morality or what third parties might come to harm. The more damage one can do, the better the demonstration - the cruelty is the point, not because one values cruelty, but to show one is <em>not</em> <em>against </em>cruelty or <em>not supporting </em>freedom, the best proof of which is to go as far as possible in the other direction. </p><p>I say ‘to the extent these people are capable of having points at all’ because they importantly <em>have lost at least some and perhaps all ability to have points. </em>This is important. </p><h2>Three Sides to Every Story</h2><p>The counterargument is presumably some form of ‘they know not what they do’ where those involved are so lost they have no ability to think or reason on such levels, and they are doing things of the form ‘convoy bad, people no like convoy, what tools we have to hurt convoy’ without any model of why such actions would accomplish anything or much care about whether they do. Slash perhaps the idea that one must Take Action and this is action, demands by various enforcers for More Power and More Authority to Do Something, with or without the general instinct that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQjZwxfA0k&amp;ab_channel=Blauu" rel="">fear will keep the local systems in line</a> without thinking that anything will slip through their fingers. </p><p>In that model, these dynamics need not involve much agency or intent. The thing ramps up continuously on its own through people following local incentive gradients, resulting in a state that no one especially wanted, but also that they did not concern themselves much with avoiding until it was far too late and the frog was already boiled to death. On my stack is writing the post Policy Debates <em>Should </em>Appear One Sided (<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PeSzc9JTBxhaYRp9b/policy-debates-should-not-appear-one-sided" rel="">the flip side of this</a>), but (and also because) there is still always (at minimum) another side to the story.</p><p>I noted last time that the reason Trudeau and the Canadian Government seemed to be so taken by surprise, had so much paralysis in terms of getting together a physical response and ended up flailing around with financial assets was because <em>such people have often lost the ability to reason at all about underlying physical reality. </em></p><p>Thus I frame the heart of the conflict between <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/06/15/simulacra-and-covid-19/" rel="">different simulacra levels</a>. The fight is between those who live primarily in simulacra levels one, where they interact with and attempt to model and alter physical reality, and those at simulacra levels three, where one cares mostly about signaling group memberships and loyalties, and often also level four where they end up using vibes and associations of various level three moves in an instinctual way that they have learned is associated with success, and lose all ability to reason or make plans in a coherent way at all, let alone model the physical world. </p><p><a href="https://theupheaval.substack.com/p/reality-honks-back?utm_source=url" rel="">An alternative framing of a similar divide by The Upheaval is ‘the Physicals versus the Virtuals.’</a> In this divide, The Virtuals deal with information and effectively form a ruling class, but because they still depend on physical reality they must continue to rely on the Physicals, and we all know how such science fiction tales usually end. </p><blockquote><p>But have a little sympathy for them: they do this not just because it is cynically convenient (though it is), but because <em>this is literally the only way they know how to navigate and influence the world</em>. The post-modern fish swims in a narrative sea, and their first reaction is always to try to control it (through what the CCP calls “discourse power”) because at heart they well and truly believe in the idea of the “social construction of reality,” as Lasch pointed out in the quote at top. If there is no fixed, objective truth, only power, then the mind’s will rules the world. Facts can be reframed as needed to create the story that best produces the correct results for Progress (this is why you will find journalists are now professionally obsessed with “storytelling” rather than reporting facts).</p><p>…</p><p>That Trudeau’s government would choose to jettison any <a href="https://theupheaval.substack.com/p/there-is-no-liberal-west?r=k5red" rel="">remaining illusion</a> of Canada still being a liberal democracy just to harm their political class enemies isn’t too surprising. It’s their method of doing so that is particularly striking: control over digital financial assets is pretty much the ultimate leverage now available to the Virtuals. We should expect more use of this tool around the world anywhere the Physicals continue to revolt against their masters.</p></blockquote><p>The Physicals must be concerned with non-socially-constructed Truth because otherwise reality will bite them in the ass. The Virtuals have their asses covered, so they are unconcerned. </p><p>There is a lot of merit in this framing, but it still seems important that those who are concerned with Truth and who do not wish it to be socially constructed should then side with the Physicals, even if in their world they deal with information.

It is a claim that  empiricists make the important discoveries and build great world-changing capitalist companies using their intuition to work on geometrically-based deep learning algorithms while all having autism and living in San Francisco and staying apolitical. In their spare time they read Dune and root for the spacing guild. </p><p>Whereas when Vitalik saw this he said ‘wait crypto is shape rotation,’ the same way I see it and think ‘New York and rationalist (and also empiricist though) are shape rotation and San Francisco is wordcel.’ And if you ask a socialist familiar with the terms, I predict most of them will claim socialism is shape rotation and capitalism is wordcel.</p><p>Who is a ‘real American’ versus whatever the other option is? I’ll tell you who isn’t <em>not </em>one, it’s whichever American is speaking. You know who is ‘out of touch’? Not my friends and allies, that’s who.

Same principle.</p><p>The initial dialectic tactic was to take a superficial division between one simulacra-3/4 alliance of wordcels/virtuals/politicians/whatevers and another <em>that is also that, </em>and frame it as <em>your side </em>being spare rotators/physicals/outsiders/whichevers, and that everyone has to pick a side or the awful other side full of wordcels/virtuals/politicians will win. </p><p>The new tactic is to deny that there were ever any meaningful physical reality at all. </p><p>Framing this as a battle between teams, of course, is playing into the whole idea of socially constructed reality and virtual wordcels operating on Simulacra-3, whereas the whole point of noticing the divide is to do the other thing. Putting more of the right people in your coalition or having the right symbolic associations does not make one right - or if you think it does, then you have already chosen your side.</p><p>In this context, we can revisit <a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/paper-is-true?utm_source=url" rel="">the Tyler Cowen concept of looking for the strong analytical thinkers</a>. </p><blockquote><p>Look for strong analytical abilities, and if you don’t see it, run the other way.</p></blockquote><p>Now it makes more sense, although it risks continuing to play into the underlying problem by looking at coalitions and choosing sides on that basis. </p><p>In that light, it is important to note that <em>this principle has now reversed itself.</em></p><p>When one looks at the original convoy, one indeed struggles to find strong analytical thinkers. </p><p>Yet the same can be said for Trudeau and the rest of the government response. In no way does it reflect strong analytical thinking or thinkers. </p><p>The Canadian government, not the convoy, is the relevant actor here. It no longer much matters how it started, only how it’s going.</p><p>In the early stages, the strong analytical thinkers had a wide variety of reactions to the situation. But you know what all the strong analytical thinkers are doing now, after the freezing of bank accounts?</p><p>As far as I can tell, at least in the informational world I have constructed for myself, <em>all of them </em>stand united. I have not seen a single attempt, however weak, to defend the actions taken or even to claim they are of minimal importance. </p><p>Including people whose views mostly differ strongly from most others in my orbit.

Hopefully without getting your accounts frozen. Others can speak better than I can on this, but I will note that I consider this policy debate sufficiently one-sided that I would support it being what the EAs call a ‘cause area.’ </p><p>The personal involves protecting yourself and those you care about against the threat of such actions coming for you. At some point in the future, this could happen to you. What is acceptable now may not be acceptable in the future, in a ‘first they come’ kind of way, and such winds can change quite fast. Or at a minimum, the need to ensure that this does not happen will constrain your behavior and your freedom and cause you much stress. </p><p>It need not be about taking explicit political or other action. Sometimes this will be a pure <em>misunderstanding </em>or other error. People get frozen out because of mistaken identity or an ‘abundance of caution.’ A very good friend of mine had it happen due to a tax dispute in which the government was neither correct nor communicative and it caused tons of trouble, although this has since been cleared up. </p><p>Thus, the value of taking actions to minimize one’s vulnerability to such actions was already important, and seems that much more important. <strong>Think about what would happen if your assets, and those of your family, were frozen </strong><em><strong>right now.</strong> </em>Your bank accounts are gone, your credit cards do not work. You can’t get new ones. What would you do? How would you keep a roof over your head and pay for food?  </p><p>Ensure that you have answers to those questions. There are a variety of ways to at least partially protect yourself, including self-custodial cryptocurrency and cold hard cash or other physical assets, especially ones that travel. </p><p>I’ve seen a bunch of ‘guess it’s time to get into crypto’ sentiment recently, and I am surprised it was not reflected more in prices. <a href="https://twitter.com/jonkay/status/1493784789710630920" rel="">For example</a>:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e777c58-a1c8-465c-a502-4f54bd318463_657x159.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e777c58-a1c8-465c-a502-4f54bd318463_657x159.png" width="657" height="159" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9e777c58-a1c8-465c-a502-4f54bd318463_657x159.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:159,&#34;width&#34;:657,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:28512,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F850ef2b9-bd4f-4760-b61b-c03fe7c84f61_668x154.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F850ef2b9-bd4f-4760-b61b-c03fe7c84f61_668x154.png" width="668" height="154" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/850ef2b9-bd4f-4760-b61b-c03fe7c84f61_668x154.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:154,&#34;width&#34;:668,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:28508,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><p>(Nothing here is ever investment advice and that goes double for crypto, but in case anyone was confused about this, such posts are Not The Way.
