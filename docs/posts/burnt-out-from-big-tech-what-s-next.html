    <h1>Ask HN: Burnt out from big tech. What&#39;s next?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Over 10 years at FAANGs (mostly working in ML) I&#39;ve lost the joy of software engineering, and I&#39;ve been at some level of burnout for a few years. I&#39;m considering leaving tech, but I wonder if a change of focus could reignite my motivation. Can you suggest some options, or share any relevant advice?</p><p>I figure I could take a sabbatical and explore some new areas, try to transition to contracting, or look for jobs outside of the big tech/web startup scene. Ideally I&#39;d like something that requires rigor, with a focus on software architecture or algorithms/optimization. I&#39;d also like to minimize the type of workplace politics I&#39;ve experienced at FAANG. I&#39;m open to suggestions that don&#39;t exclusively have to do with software. Part of me is tired of spending so much of my life in front of a computer.</p><p>Here are some disorganized ideas that might give a sense of my interests:</p><p>- Cryptography and security (not cryptocurrency/blockchain): I have a math background and I was always an algebra/discrete math person, so this seems a potential fit.</p><p>- Formal verification / theorem proving</p><p>- Open messaging standards (e.g., Matrix): I find the current state with siloed proprietary messengers a travesty</p><p>- Open repositories of knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap)</p><p>- &#34;User-empowering&#34; software (e.g., Emacs, Ableton Live)</p><p>- Distributed systems</p><p>- Programming language development (compilers, libraries)</p><p>- Graphics (though the gaming industry isn&#39;t exactly the place to recover from burnout)</p><p>- Research in cognitive science, psychedelics (lots of hype here though), complex systems, physics</p><p>- Studying music composition or audio engineering</p><p>- Helping out with homelessness, loneliness, the elderly or disabled</p></div></div></div>
