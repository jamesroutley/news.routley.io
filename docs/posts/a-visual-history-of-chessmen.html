							<hr/><h2><label for="chaturanga"><em>Chaturanga, chess ancestor</em> <small></small></label></h2>
							
							<div>
							
								<p>By the 7th Century CE, people in India were playing <em>chaturanga</em> (&#34;four divisions&#34;). The name refers to four types of solider that made up the game—infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots, commanded by a raja—that were modeled on the armies of the time. It was the innovation of these different piece types, which each moved in different ways, that distinguished <em>chaturanga</em> from other war games. The different piece types are the ancestors of the pieces of the modern game, and one of the reasons why we can trace chess back to <em>chaturanga</em>.</p>
								
								<p><em>Chaturagna</em> spread outwards from India and is thought to be the common ancestor of many similar games. When it reaches Persia in the 8th Century, the game becomes <em>shatranj</em>, which would later reach Europe and develop into modern chess.</p>
								
								<div>
									<p><img src="https://chesshistory.github.io/figures/chaturanga_map.png" alt="A globe showing chaturanga, originating in India, and through arrows how it informed other games, including buddhiyuta in later India. In South East Asia, it became sittuyin and makuk. In China it became xiàngqí, which became jiangqi and shogi in Korea and Japan. In Mongolia it became hiashatar. To the west, it became shatranj in the Persian and Arab worlds, which spawned senterej in Ethiopia and tsatsarandi in modern-day Nigeria, Tamerlane chess in central Asia, and chess in Europe, along with mediaeval European variants grant acredex and courier chess."/></p><p>A map showing the spread of <em>chaturanga</em> and its influence on other games around the globe, including <em>shatranj</em>, chess, <em>xiàngqí</em> (China) and <em>shogi</em> (Japan). </p>
								</div>
								
								<p>If you were transported to ancient India, you would not necessarily recognise the game they were playing as chess. One of the earliest descriptions we have of how <em>chaturanga</em> was played comes from the 11th Century Persian scholar Al-Biruni&#39;s text, <a href="#footnotes" title="al-Biruni, (Alberuni) (c. 1030). India as translated by Sachau, E. C. (1888) (1st ed. p 182-185). Trübner and Co., London."><em>India</em></a>. Like modern chesss, <em>chaturanga</em> was played on an eight by eight grid, which had been borrowed from an existing Indian game called <em>ashtapada</em>. In the <em>chaturanga</em> Al-Biruni describes, however, this board was the battleground for <em>four</em> players and four different armies at once. It was also a game of chance (!), where players rolled dice to decide which pieces to move.</p>
								
								<p>Both modern chess players and 11th Century Persian <em>shatranj</em> players would find the moves of this game to be different. Al-Biruni descirbes the elephant (the ancient bishop) as able to move only one square diagonally at a time, or one square forward instead. (&#34;They say that these five squares (i.e. the one straight forward and the others at the corners) are the places occupied by the trunk and the four feet of the elephant.&#34;)</p>
								
								<p>If <em>shatranj</em> to the West and <em>xiàngqí</em> to the East, both games for two players, descend from the same game, it would make sense to assume that the common ancestor was also a two player board game. Chess historian <a href="#footnotes" title="Murray, H. J. R. (1913). 1.2 Chess in India. In A History of Chess (1st ed. pp 51-67). Clarendon Press, Oxford.">H J R Murray, who wrote the definitive treatise of the origins of chess, thought,</a> from the way Persian and Arabics writers described <em>chaturanga</em> in reference to <em>shatranj</em>, that there must have been two-player versions of the game in India at the same time as Al-Biruni witnessed the four-player game. Murray cannot say which, two- or four-player <em>chaturanga</em>, he believes came first. However, in is certain that there were two-player Indian chess games in later centuries. These, which have dispensed with dice, were called by some variation of <em>buddhidyūta</em>, &#34;intellectual game&#34;.</p>

								<p><img src="https://chesshistory.github.io/pieces/afrasiab.png" alt="A cartoon of Afrasiab chessmen."/>
							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Afrasiab</h2>
							
							<p>In the Second Persian Empire, <em>chaturanga</em> becomes <em>shatranj</em>. As <em>shatranj</em>, new rules are introduced that cause the game to begin to resemble modern chess, including the rule that the King cannot be captured but must be rendered helpless: shah mat, the King is helpless, gives us the word checkmate.</p>
							
							<p>The earliest <em>shatranj</em> pieces were figural (depicting recognisble forms from life), like those discovered in <a title="Samarkand State Museum Reserve. Photo ACDF of Uzbekistan." href="#footnotes">Afrasiab</a>, modern Uzbekistan, made from ivory and dating from the 700s. They feature soldiers on foot, horseback or riding chariots or elephants.</p>

							<p>The Afrasiab chessmen are normally considered the oldest definitive chessmen. While there followed a shift in favour of abstract pieces, they must not have been completely replaced, as later examples of Islamic figurative pieces have been found.</p>

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Abstract Persian</h2>
							
							<p>The shift to abstract chessmen has traditionally been attributed to religious an-iconism: the prohibition of figurative objects to prevent idolatry. However, not only have later figural pieces been found, but per the Met, abstract Persian chessmen are now thought to predate the Islamic conquest. Perhaps the adoption of symbolic chessmen were to make them easier to distinguish in games, or cheaper to manufacture?</p>
							
							<p><em>Shah</em> and <em>firzan</em> (King and Queen) are represented by a large and small throne. The <em>fil</em> (elephant, i.e. bishop) is represented with two tusks, the <em>faras</em> (knight) with one and the <em>rukh</em> (chariot, i.e. rook) with a cleft.</p>

							<p>Although they have a simple silhouette, many of these pieces have been found adorned with intricate designs.</p>

								<p><em>Shatranj</em> entered Europe through Sicily (conquered and ruled by Arab caliphates from the late 9th to 11th Centuries) and through Moorish Spain (conquered in the 8th Century). The earliest surviving European description of chess is the <em>Versus de scachis</em>, a 10th C. poem found in the Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland, which praises the game and describes the board and how the pieces may move. At this point, the game is still very close to <em>shatranj</em>. The rooks are the only long-ranged pieces. The queen may only move diagonally and only one square at a time. The bishop moves diagonally two at time, not stopping at the first square it moves to. </p>

								<p>Many of the earliest chessmen in Europe, which follow the same abstract Persian pattern, were found in the Muslim territories of Andalusian Spain and Sicily. Many are thought to originate from the Middle East. Other examples may have been brought to Europe later, during the Crusades, or manufactured to the same design locally.</p>

								<p><img src="https://chesshistory.github.io/pieces/charlemagne.png" alt="A drawing the Charlemagne chessmen."/>
							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Charlemagne</h2>
							
							<p>Later, Europeans began to carve their own figural pieces. One of the earliest extant examples are the <a title="Bibliothèque Nationale." href="#footnotes"><em>Charlemagne</em></a> chessmen. Although legendarily associated with Charlemagne, these chessmen are thought to date from about 200 years later. It was gifted to the French monarchy and ended up in the Treasury of Saint-Denis.</p>
							
							<p>By now the vizier has become a Queen in Europe. She is referred to as <em>regina</em> (Latin: queen) in the 10th C. Einsiedeln poem, and is depicted as a queen in this set.</p>

							<p>A simple explanation for her transformation is that her Queenliness was suggested by her proximity to the King. <a href="#footnotes" title="Davidson H A (1949). ch 3 Female of the Species in A Short History of Chess. Greenberg New York.">Davidson says</a> the change was due to homophony between <em>fierge</em> (counselor) and <em>vierge</em> (maiden), writing &#34;she owes her title to accident of sound.&#34; He has it that <em>maiden</em> became the Virgin Mary and the &#34;queen of angels&#34;—but he also believes it only happened in the 15th-16th Century while, as we can see, the piece was definitely depicted and referred to as a Queen long before then.</p>
							
							<p>Carved from ivory in Salerno, Italy, in the 11th century, the <em>Charlemagne</em> chessmen feature <a href="#footnotes" title="Voyages et histoires : jeu dit de Charlemagne, Bibliothèque nationale de France.">Norman-Sicilian-style warriors</a> and other figures. The King and Queen are depicted in elaborate pavilions.</p>

							<p>It is hard to imagine that such elaborate figural sets were commonplace for play, with this one being so precious as to be kept with the French crown jewels.</p>

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Lewis</h2>
							
							<p>The largest hoard of mediaeval chessmen is the <a title="British Museum and National Museum of Scotland" href="#footnotes">Lewis hoard, discovered in Uig, Scotland</a>.</p>

							<p>These pieces are known for their caricature-like figures with funny, expressive faces. Queens sit on their thrones looking bored, while warders (rooks) gnaw on their shields.</p>
							
							<p>While the Charlemagne set features figural elephants, by the Lewis set the elephants have become bishops, as the two &#34;tusks&#34; of the elephant pieces were reinterpreted as a bishop&#39;s mitre in Europe. This explanation appears to satisfy everyone. </p>
							
							<p>Although he is called a bishop in English, in other languages he is identified with a different character. In other parts of Western Europe, he is often called a messenger or runner (as in German, Danish, and Dutch) or a fool or jester (French and Romanian). In Russia and places more strongly influenced by the Russian, Arabic, or Indian chess traditions, he remains an elephant. </p>
							
							<p>Meanwhile, chariots of the Charlemagne set become sword-and-shield wielding warriors in the Lewis set, but only later would be re-imagined as towers.</p>

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Italian Renaissance</h2>
							
							<p>An incomplete set from Northern Italy, donated with period chess board to the <a href="#footnotes" title="Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Accession WA1947.191.229.">Ashmolean Museum by J. Francis Mallett</a>. These have been produced on a lathe: this soon becomes the dominant approach to producing chess pieces over individual carving.</p>

							<p><a href="#footnotes" title="Williams, G. (2000). 2. The Renaissance. In Master Pieces (1st ed., pp. 27–31). Viking Studio (Penguin Putnam Inc.).">Williams identifies</a> the Mallett set as the work of Florentine Baldassarre Embriachi, who &#34;invented a way of preparing and carving bone so that it could be used like ivory.&#34; Williams names the pieces, above, left to right, as the King or Queen (sharing a shape, but the King being taller), the bishop (as a standard bearer, <em>alfiere</em> in Italian, presenting a flag or shield), the rook (&#34;exotic, bird-shaped. Some countries believe the rook to be a mythical monster bird,&#34; i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_(mythology)">a rukh or roc</a>), then the pawn. Williams also compares this set to the illustrations accompanying a 16th C. chess manual. </p>
							
							<p>In the 15th Century, the Queen acquired her long-range moveset and became the most powerful piece as part of a number of chess reforms in late 15th Century Spain. <a title="Yalom, M (2004). ch 2, 7, 11 in Birth of the Chess Queen: A History. Rivers Oram Press." href="#footnotes">Feminist scholar Marilyn Yalom</a> connects this with the cult around the Virgin Mary and Queen Isabella I of Castile. Yalom also suggests the 10th Century Holy Roman Empresses Adelaide of Burgundy and her daughter-in-law Theophanu as inspirations for the vizier&#39;s transmutation. These reforms also made the bishop a long ranged piece, gave pawns their two-step first move, and introduced castling. </p>

							<p>In the <a title="Photo via Wikimedia Commons." href="#footnotes">family portrait of the 3rd Baron Windsor (1568)</a>, detail below, Windsor&#39;s children play with simple, abstract (that is, non-figural) chessmen.</p>

							<blockquote>
							&#34;Our English chessmen are commonly made nothing like unto these foresaid fashions [they are not figural]: to wit, the king is made the highest or longest; the queen is longest next unto him; the bishop is made with a sharpe top, and cloven in the middle not much unlike to a bishop’s mitre; the knight has his top cut asloope [cf. Headless Horsemen, below], as though being dubbed [i.e. in a ceremony conferring knighthood] knight; the rook is made most like the king and the queen, but is not so long; the pawns made the smallest...&#34;
							</blockquote>
							
							<p>That is, non-figural chessmen where the King, Queen, and rook are distinguished by height, the bishop has a cloven mitre, and knights are slope-cut.

							<hr/><h2>Selenus</h2>
							
							<p>This pattern has its origins in the early 17th Century, where similar chessmen appear in the illustrations of Gustavus Selenus&#39;s 1616 chess manual. It would remain popular in Germany and Northern Europe until the 1850s.</p>
							
							<p><em>Selenus</em> pieces are slender and delicate chessmen with multiple tiers. Knights have become more clearly horse&#39;s heads, and the rook clearly a tower.</p>
							
							<p>A popular explanation given for the reimagining of the rook as a tower is that <em>rukh</em> was equated with either Mediaeval Latin <em>rocca</em> or Italian <em>rocco</em> meaning tower, and indeed in modern Italian <em>rocco</em> means both <em>rock</em> and <em>fortress</em>. However, <a href="#footnotes" title="Ròcco. Vocabolario on line. Treccani.">Treccani</a> asserts <em>rocco</em> first arrived in Italian meaning the chessman, from the Persian <em>rukh</em>, and only later gained the meaning tower (synonymous with <em>torre</em>). <em>Rocca</em> appears in <a href="#footnotes" title="Rocca. Du Cange.">Du Cange&#39;s Mediaeval Latin dictionary</a> with the meaning of <em>fortress</em>, but its etymology is unknown.</p>

							<p>Alternatively, <a title="Hans Hollander (2017). Cyclopes, Elephants and Chess Rooks. Originally published 2007 in Festscrhift for Götz Pochat." href="#footnotes">Hans Holländer</a> has attributed the origins of the rook-as-tower to Vida&#39;s 16th Century poem Scacchia Ludus, where rooks are depicted as war elephants which carried towers on their backs.</p>

							<p>The centre of chess in the 1700s, and Philidor&#39;s (1726–1795) regular haunt, was the <em>Café de la Régence</em>, Paris. It gives its name to the <em>Régence</em> or <em>Regency</em> pattern chessmen that were popular at the time.</p>

							<p>Though they would fall out of favour for easier to distinguish pieces, they were still popular enough by the early 20th Century to be depicted in Antti Favén&#39;s 1913 painting of the Café.</p>

							<p>Urn-shaped stands with dainty stems. Kings with flattened crowns. Queens and bishops with spherical finials (harder to tell them apart). Bishops collars with crimped edges to evoke the biretta, a clerical hat. Knights are figural horse heads: contemporaneous sets with turned knights instead of carved, resembling the bishops and Queens, are called <em>Directoire</em> sets. </p>

							<p>These are often called <em>Spike</em> or <em>Spiked</em> sets. Camaratta&#39;s name for these is more poetic: <em>Petal and Pistil</em>. His company &#34;House of Staunton&#34; produced a run of reproductions of the pattern in the 1990s. </p>

							<p>The prevalence of lathe-turned pieces in the 18th century did not completely displace carved, figural chessmen.</p>

							<p>Dieppe, the centre of ivory carving in France, was known for producing ivory bust-style chessmen depicting political themes. Opposing kings became busts of real people in conflict, like Henri IV and Napoleon, and sets depicted the meeting of different national armies from history.</p>

							<p>The above example (from the next century, 1870 <a href="#footnotes" title="Metropolitan Museum of Art accessions 48.174.153a–p">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>) represents King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada_War">Granada War</a>.

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Barleycorn</h2>
							
							<p>Ornate chessmen turned from bone with wide barrels in the middle of the stems of the Kings and Queens. They are often carved with ornate foliage decorations. The name <em>Barleycorn</em>, i.e. the grain of barley, presumably after these foliate designs. A barleycorn is also a unit of measurement or, figuratively, something very small and so beneath notice: neither seems appropriate here. Jim Joannau believes <em>Barleycorn</em> is a recent coinage from the 1970s, with the sets being referred to in 19th C. period advertisements as simply &#34;bone chessmen&#34;.</p>
							
							<p>While all such sets are commonly called &#34;Barleycorn&#34;, some collectors believe the name should only apply to those sets with foliate decoration, and distinguish sets with different decorations (e.g. van Reij calls a Barleycorn variant <em>Ropetwist</em>) or without additional adornment (aka <em>Plain Barleycorn</em> or <em>Ribbed</em>). In Joannau&#39;s research, <a href="#footnotes" title="Joannou, J. (2024). When is a Barleycorn, not a Barleycorn? CCI International Meeting in Oxford, UK. [conference paper].">he produced a timeline</a> suggesting plainer sets came earlier than had been thought, with the more foliate Barleycorn designs following them (rather than the ribbed designs being cheaper knock offs of more expensive foliate Barleycorns).</p>

							<p>Because only the outside tube of the bone (cortex) can be carved, these are made from multiple pieces screwed together. The diameter of the marrow that filled the bone limits the minimum diameter of the barrels.</p>

							<p>Varied King&#39;s finials—flower, cog-shaped, or imperial crowns—possible. Rooks as full towers, with or without flag.</p>

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Pulpit</h2>
							
							<p>Though historically referred to as <em>Spanish Pulpit</em> chessmen, the origin of the intricately decorated <em>Pulpit</em> chessmen has been a matter of debate—but they&#39;re probably not from Spain.</p>

							<p>The Russian bone carving centre of Kholmogory has been suggested, although interestingly most of these sets appear in English collections. <a href="#footnotes" title="Garrick Coleman, Note on the origins of Pulpit Chess Sets.">Garrick Coleman asserts</a> that these were made by French prisoners of war, held in England during the Napoleonic Wars, who were known to make bone crafts to sell for income. He cites the material—they are invariably bone—and &#34;charming naive form of carving&#34; resulting from make-do prison tools as in common with other Napoleonic prisoner of war crafts. He compares them to a figural chess set also asserted to be from Napoleonic prisoners of war. The first such prisoner of war camp was Normans Cross, established 1796 outside of Peterborough, and Coleman directs us to a <em>Pulpit</em> set among the Peterborough Museum&#39;s Norman Cross collection.</p>
							
							<p>Williams is not convinced. <a href="#footnotes" title="Williams, G. (2000). 3. The Expansion of Chess. In Master Pieces (1st ed., pp. 54-55). Viking Studio (Penguin Putnam Inc.).">He writes,</a></p>
							
							<blockquote>
								Pulpit sets do have many features similar to the work of prisoners, but there are also many anomalies—too many to confidently describe the [pattern] as a Napoleon prisoner-of-war set. The mystery of where the Pulpit sets may have originated remains for the moment. These set do have a strong English connection, and perhaps an old colonial one. 
							</blockquote>
							
							<p>Of the Peterborough Museum set, Williams is hesitant to agree that it is from the camp over its lack of provenance, having been added to the collection in 1953 when donated by a local family. </p>

							<p>Pulpit chessmen may be entirely non-figural, but many partial-figural examples exist (below). There are modern Mexican bone sets known as Mexican Pulpit due to their similarity to these patterns.  </p>

							</p></div>
							<div><hr/><h2>Staunton</h2>
							
							<p>The &#39;just so&#39; story of the <em>Staunton</em> pattern is this: the variety of chessmen designs popular in different parts of Europe had become an obstacle to international chess competitions. The existing styles could be impractical and top-heavy, or players had difficulty distinguishing pieces of unfamiliar sets. Nathaniel Cooke designed a more practical set that so impressed Howard Staunton (1810-1874), chess master, that he put his name to them.</p>

							<p>Cooke was supposedly inspired by London architecture and horses of Classical sculpture like the Elgin/Parthenon Marbles. Variants on the knight design are used to distinguish different antique and collectible <em>Staunton</em> sets. The Queen now has her coronet, rather than a ball finial of <em>Upright</em>, <em>St. George</em>, and other antecedent sets. For the <em>Smithsonian</em>, architect <a href="#footnotes" title="Stamp, J. (2013). How the Chess Set Got Its Look and Feel. Smithsonian Magazine.">Jimmy Stamp writes</a>:</p>

							<blockquote>

							<p>The original <em>Staunton</em> chessmen were produced by Jaques of London from 1849. Later, other manufacturers produced their own <em>Staunton</em>-style sets. The leading expert on the <em>Staunton</em> pattern is <a href="#footnotes" title="Fersht, A. (2018) Jaques and British Chess Company Chess Sets.‎ Kaissa Publications, Cambridge.">Sir Alan Fersht FRS</a>, better known for his work on protein engineering, who has published a couple of guides to Jaques and contemporaneous chess sets.</p>

							<p>Today wood, plastic, and metal sets following the <em>Staunton</em> pattern are cheap and widely available. <em>Staunton</em> became the de facto standard chessmen by the mid-20th Century, and today FIDE officially requires the pattern for tournaments.</p>

							<p>So practical and iconic were the <em>Staunton</em> chessmen that even before they reached total cultural hegemony, the iconic pattern would inform other chessmen designs internationally that responded to or took on features from the pattern. </p></div>

							<p>The formidable <em>Austrian Coffeehouse</em> or <em>Old Vienna</em> chessmen, are something of a fusion between the <em>Biedermeier</em> and <em>Staunton</em> patterns, although auction houses seem to use <em>Coffeehouse</em> as more of a catch all for any non-<em>Staunton</em> Central European patterns.</p>

							<p>These became the typical chessmen for games in Vienna and Central Europe from the late 19th until the middle of the 20th Century, when <em>Staunton</em> gradually overtook them. The kings and Queens have gear-like crowns. Bishop mitres are usually opposite coloured. </p>

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Česká Klubovka</h2>
							
							<p>The <em>Česká Klubovka</em>—Chess Club—chessmen were designed in Prague in the 1880s by Czech sculptor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohuslav_Schnirch">Bohuslav Schnirch</a>. Writing in 2018, chess collector <a href="#footnotes" title="Lanier, N. (2018). Check or Czech? - the Czech Club Pieces. Presented at the 18th CCI World Congress in Prague 2018.">Nicholas Lanier contextualised</a> Schnirch&#39;s chessmen as a salvo in a culture war asserting independent Czech national identity.

							</p><blockquote>
							&#34;But chess was also split along the cultural and language divide... In the course of the [eighteen] eighties Schnirch found it necessary to provide his club with a proper chess set in a different style—the prevalent coffeehouse chess men were a Vienna invention, therefore the oppressors&#39; &#34;chessic&#34; imposition... a new chess set responding to the national spirit of Czech Chess players was needed.&#34;
							</blockquote>
							
							<p>The influence of the <em>Staunton</em> design is clear, but with a Czech twist. Opposite-coloured heads or finials, common in Central European sets, are typical for the bishops and often present on the Queen and King. The bishops tend not to have a split mitre, but have a grove or flick of colour suggestive of preaching band neckwear. </p>

							<hr/><h2>American Chess Company</h2>
							
							<p>A number of US chess patterns from the <em>American Chess Company</em>, which feature kings with pointed spear-tips for finials. They are associated with the <a href="https://cs1904.com/">1904 Cambridge Springs event</a>, such that any early 20th C. American Chess Company set is often given the name <em>&#34;Cambridge Springs&#34;</em>.</p> 
							
							<p>The variants of this style have differences in the knights and queens. A set that appears in American Chess Company advertisements from the time has queens with pointed prongs on their coronets and angular knights with short muzzles and sawtooth-like manes. While such sets are often referred to as &#34;Cambridge Springs&#34; sets, a photo of the event provided by Steven Etzel shows a variant with more traditional Staunton-style knights, and queen coronets with flattened teeth more like crenellations. Three of <em>these</em> sets also appear in a 1922 photo of a simul at the United States Capitol building.</p>

							<p>The 1904 Cambridge Springs event was an international chess competition held in Pennsylvania, featuring Emanuel Lasker (1868—1941). It gave its name to the Cambridge Springs line in the Queen&#39;s Gambit Declined. </p>

							<hr/><h2>Cannon Rook</h2>

							<p>A rare but interesting early Soviet pattern, known for its rooks designed after cannons.</p>
							
							<p>Chuck Grau relates that his copy was sold to him as late 19th century, but <a href="#footnotes" title="Grau C. (2022). Pushki on the Chessboard: The Soviet Cannon Rook Set. Soviet and Late Tsarist Chess Sets blog."> he dates it to around 1935.</a> Grau notes that Cannon Rook pieces appear in a photo from that time and on the cover of a 1995 book, <em>Satranç Eğitim Metodu</em> (<em>Chess Training Method</em>) by H. Sertaç Dalkiran. Grau draws a connection between the pieces and a particular Russian cultural love of cannons, citing the 1812 Overture and the 16th century mammoth Tsar Cannon in the Kremlin. </p>

							<p>They are very &#34;conic&#34;: wide conic bases on all pieces, and the kings, Queens, bishops, and pawns have conic stems and profiles. </p>
							
							<p>A similar set passed through Alan Power of TheChessSchach&#39;s hands. Power christened it <em>&#34;<a href="https://www.thechessschach.com/product/militibus-ex-antiquis-ruthenorum-old-russian-warriors-antique-soviet-chess-set-post-revolution-era-circa-1918-1930/">Militibus ex Antiquis Ruthenorum</a>&#34;</em>, &#34;for the soldiers from ancient Ruthenorum&#34; (i.e. ancient Rus), which he gives as &#34;Old Russian Warriors.&#34; Other than the rooks, which are normal turrets, the pieces are almost identical in design to Grau&#39;s set. Power thought his set was from the 1920s so perhaps they were the immediate ancestor of the cannon rook design. </p>
							
							<p>Coincidentally, the cannon (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%82%AE">炮</a>) is a piece in xiàngqí, the Chinese cousin of chess.

Soviet and Late Tsarist Chess Sets">Chuck Grau observed</a> the constructivist influence on these unusual, early Soviet pieces, and noted they also appear in the (itself constructivist) poster for <em>Chess Fever</em>, a 1925 Soviet film.</p>

							<p>Constructivism is a Russian art movement, influenced by cubism. <a href="#footnotes" title="Wolfe, S. (no date). Art Movement: Constructivism. Artland Magazine.">The constructivists thought</a>...

							<blockquote>
							Art was to be built... the artist became an engineer wielding tools, instead of a painter holding a brush... they thought that art should reflect the industrial world and that it should be used as a tool in the Communist revolution.
							</blockquote>
							
							<p>Compared to more recognisable, later designs, these look strikingly un-Soviet. Short and stout, with pedestals wider at the top than the bottom, these pieces express a very different design philosophy to that of the slender <em>Mordovian</em>, <em>Grandmaster</em> and similar patterns. They&#39;re the end of a de-Stauntonised design cul-de-sac that also features the conic cannon-rocks set and some Tsarist pieces.</p>

The rook (<em>kaigamma</em>, marshall) has two points that the Met describe as &#34;long ears&#34;, the bishop (<em>bintu</em>) comes to a single points.</p>  
							
							<p>The pieces are stylised and abstract, and retain the Islamic tradition.

							<blockquote>
							He designed many original chess sets. The first was in 1920, in the Dada tradition of taking an object and presenting it in a different form. Ray created a chess set from the items found in his artist&#39;s studio: some geometric objects, the broken neck of a violin, a vase, and a sphere. With his artist&#39;s insight he transformed them into a modern work of twentieth-century art. A pyramid became a king, a cone a queen, a vase a bishop, a broken violin neck a knight, a cube a rook, and a sphere secured to a button for a base became a pawn.

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Hourglass</h2>
							
							<p>An uncommon Soviet set. They askew the extra wide bases and long stems common in other Soviet designs. To me the kings and Queens resemble <em>hourglasses</em>: their heads and bases like two cones meeting at a narrow waist. Others have compared the bases to hand-bells. The bishops&#39; mitres sit atop stretched out, cylindrical necks. The collars of the kings, Queens, and bishops  deviate from the three ringed collars of the <em>Staunton</em> pattern and other Soviet descendants like the <em>Baku</em> in that each ring is now spread out. The rooks are simple, either flat-topped or with a wall with no embrasures. The knights are also plain, with erect ears and no manes. </p>
							
							<p>Some sets have appeared among Ukraine-based sellers where they might be listed as German or Soviet. Chess set refurbisher Alan Power, who worked on a couple of these sets, places them in Russia (he calls the pattern <a href="#footnotes" title="Power, A. (2023). Dogues of War (Domini Bellum); Rare Soviet Analysis Chess Set, c.1945. TheChessSchach.">&#34;a fairly rare Stalin Era Soviet pattern that was first manufactured in the 1920s&#34;</a>). While smaller bases and small stems make them look less &#34;Soviet&#34; than later patterns, they do askew Christian symbolism and wear Soviet Red vs Black livery. I don&#39;t think anyone doubts these were made in the USSR.</p>
							
							<p>Are these sets derivative of a German pattern (as  I have it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/354458331618808/posts/2149643658766924/?_rdr">second hand</a> that Langer believes of Tsarist/Soviet designs in general)? Power notes the bell-bottomed bases as &#34;Germanic,&#34; however I have not seen any sets held up as German antecedents to this pattern.</p>
							
							<p>To me they look like a more ornate (&amp; perhaps therefore an antecedent) version of <a href="#baku"><em>Baku</em></a> pieces: you can see how the bell-shaped bases and undeveloped stems of <em>Hourglass</em> pieces could simplify into <em>Baku</em> cone-shaped bases with mass production, likewise the King and Queen heads into upturned cones. The rooks, sans crenellations, are also similar.</p>
							
							<p>There is little in the way of provenance for this design, other than they seem to appear in Ukraine. In a listing from Mykhailo Kovalenko, a Ukraine-based seller of vintage chess sets, he shares accompanying quality-control paperwork referred to Drahičyn and Brest in modern-day Belarus, which I found exciting at first but this probably refers just to the board only, which Kovalenko states is not original to the set. Power references a 1950 photo of Vasily Smyslov (1921—2010) playing with the pattern, included below, but it is the only such photo I have found.</p>
							
							<p>Power gives the sets he refurbishes whimsical names in dog-Latin. Of these, he called one &#34;Domini Bellum&#34; (something like &#34;the war of the Lord&#34;, which he translates as &#34;the Dogues of War&#34; but might just be a play on the word &#34;bell&#34;), and the other &#34;Et Sanguis Baronem&#34; (&#34;and the baron&#39;s blood&#34;, which he translates as &#34;the Red Baron&#34;). In the absence of a name in common use, I christen these <em>Hourglass</em> pieces. </p>

							<hr/><h2>Grandmaster</h2>
							
							<p><em>Grandmaster</em> chessmen are a small family of patterns of Soviet chessmen which would remain popular in the Soviet Union through to at least the 1970s. <a href="#footnotes" title="Grau, C. (2022). Four Styles of Soviet Grandmaster Chess Sets: The GM1 Chess Pieces. Soviet and Late Tsarist Chess Sets blog.">Chuck Grau explains</a> the name as essentially a functional descriptor, i.e. &#34;chess sets as used by Grandmasters,&#34; (but not exclusively in that they were widely used at all levels of play).</p>
							
							<blockquote>Soviet sets typically did not have names, just as most Soviet consumer products did not have brand names. Instead, chess sets were described by functional categories. <em>Grandmaster</em> sets were used by grandmasters. <em>Tournament</em> sets were for use generally in tournaments. <em>Yunost</em> sets were for students and youth.</blockquote>
							
							<p>I took this to mean that <em>гроссмейстер</em> (<em>Grossmeyster</em>/<em>Grandmaster</em>) is the endonym for this pattern, but I am not certain if this is so. At least, Google image searching for the Russian &#34;шахматные фигуры гроссмейстера&#34; (&#34;grandmaster chess pieces&#34;) does not come up with any similar sets. Instead, the term may originate from collector <a href="#footnotes" title="Vieira, A. R. (2012). Soviet chess sets 8 peças de Xadrez Soviético 8. Xadrez Memória.">Arlindo Vieira, who wrote</a>:</p>
							
							<blockquote>
							an introduction to what I call GRANDMASTER PIECES, meaning Soviet-style chess pieces that were characteristic of many clubs, competitions, and even casual chess enthusiasts who used them in parks or gardens across the former Soviet Union. 
							</blockquote>
							
							<p>(translated from Portuguese). In his piece, Vieira divided <em>Grandmaster</em> into four patterns. The cartoon above shows <em>Grandmaster 2</em>, also known as the <em>Bronstein</em>. The stems are less convex in GM 3 and 4 sets—but a fuller explanation on the features that distingush these sets (and other designations, like <em>Grandmaster Supreme</em>) is best left Vieira and Grau.</p>
							
							<p>They are a Sovietisation of <em>Staunton</em> chessmen; a simplification of the pieces intended for mass production. </p>

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Lardy Staunton</h2>
							
							<p>Lardy were a French chess set manufacturer known for the mass production and export of <em>Staunton</em>-pattern sets. They began production of these boxwood sets in the 1930s, and Lardy reached their greatest popularity in the 1950s-60s before closing down in 1992. <a href="#footnotes" title="Lanier, N. (2016). Chess production in the Jura. chess-museum.com">Nicholas Lanier wrote an essay on the history of the Lardy company</a> and their rivals in the French woodmaking region of Jura.</p>
							
							<p>Most distinctive of <em>Lardy</em> sets is the <em>Lardy knight</em>, which has a recognisable profile with an erect head held parallel to the ground, bulging eyes and striations on the neck. Their characterful appearance—Lanier called them &#34;Roman nosed&#34;—probably contributes to enduring popularity of <em>Lardy</em> sets: what was once a mass-market pattern is now the subject of premium, luxury reproductions.</p>

							<p>The <em>Deutsche Bundesform</em>, German federal shape, was developed under the Nazis to replace foreign Staunton chessmen with Germany&#39;s own nationalist and regime-endorsed design. Holger Langer attributes the design to German chess master <a href="#footnotes" title="Langer H. German &#39;Bundesform&#39; Chess Set (Habera), 1935-1945.">Ehrhardt Post.</a></p>

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Belarus</h2>
						
							<p>The King and Queen have flattened, round crowns and spindly stems, so resemble shiitake <em>mushrooms</em>. Their collars around the stem even resemble the ring around a mushroom&#39;s stem (protective material left behind when the mushroom&#39;s gills emerge). To me they look like flying saucers and Seattle&#39;s Space Needle. Slender stems emerge from the typical Soviet base, extra wide for stability. The bishops mitres are huge (such bishops have been called &#39;acorns&#39;) and without a groove. </p>
							
							<p>Nicholas Lanier was unsure of the origin of these pieces, which he called <em>Svelte</em>, but suggested a  German origin. However, Chuck Grau, who calls them <em>Mushrooms</em>, reckons they originate from Minsk, modern day Belarus, where many sets have surfaced. Holger Langer notes they were common in the Soviet Union, whatever their origins.</p>

							<hr/><h2>Wartime chess sets</h2>
							
							<p>Reflecting wartime austerity during the 1940s, simple travel sets, where chessmen were represented by symbols printed onto card or wooden tokens, were sent to soldiers on the front or in Red Cross parcels to prisoner-of-war camps (such as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-american-red-cross-chess-checkers-and-tic-tac-toe-pocket-set/BwFDS69_hXMspQ">this one</a> from the World Chess Hall of Fame, St. Louis, Missouri).  Turned over, they could do as draughts men. </p>
							
							<p>A model of these, called <em>St. George&#39;s Combination Chess and Draughtsmen</em>, was produced in Bakelite in the 1940s in England. </p>

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Valdai</h2>
						
							<p><em>Valdai</em> chessmen, or <em>Valdai Nobles</em>, are mid-Century Soviet chessmen. They have wide bases, and rounded funnel-shaped stems like the domes of a Russian Orthodox cathedral. The kings and Queens and cone shaped heads and opposite-colour finials. The bishop&#39;s mitre is spherical (no cut or groove, of course). The rooks are distinctive: a small turret without crenelations connected to a much wider base. </p>
							
							<p>The knights are the most far removed from their <a href="#mordovian-latvian"><em>Mordovian-Latvian</em></a> cousins, being more slender and angular, with clear facets. <a href="#footnotes" title="Power A (2019). The Gulag Knights. TheChessSchach blog.">Alan Power wrote about these sets in his blog</a> and the knights in particular captured his imagination. He describes them as &#34;‘elbow’ shaped [with] minimalist facial features [and] curiously shaped ‘badger-like’ muzzle[s]&#34; and likened them to the Clangers (the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Clangers_2016_V%26A_Museum_of_Childhood.jpg">pink, alien, fabric mice</a>). To me they look similar to the 15th Century &#34;Novgorod knight&#34;. </p>
							
							<p>These are known to come from Valdai (or Valday), a region in Russia between Moscow and St. Petersburg, on account of stamps found on the inside of the accompanying boards/boxes. Power says that this refers to a gulag near Novgorod. Trying to understand the geography, I had a look at the gulag.online map but was unable to tell which gulag corresponded. In one of those strange co-incidences, just as I happened to be writing this, <a href="#footnotes" title="Grau C. (2025). Gulag Knights: a Tale of Two Valdais. Soviet and Late Tsarist Chess Sets blog.">Chuck Grau shared his and Sergey Kovalenko&#39;s detective work</a>, which determined the source of the confusion: the earlier versions of this pattern were produced in the Valdai Regional Industrial Manufactory (not a prison or Gulag), but from 1957, ITK-4 took over the Manufactory&#39;s woodworking equipment and production of the sets. ITK-4 was part of the post-Gulag prison system, although not a Gulag <em>per se</em>.</p>
							
							<p>So for &#34;Valdai&#34;, what of &#34;Nobles&#34;? Grau mentions that it is a rare example of a Soviet endonym while Power relates that he was told these were referred to as &#34;boyar&#34; chessmen (<em>боярин</em>, a sort of feudal lord Power translates as &#34;noble&#34;). However, I&#39;ve not been able to substantiate this yet. I wasn&#39;t able to find any Russian-language hits online using боярин (boyarin) or related phrases (e.g. <em>«Валдайские боярские шахматы»</em>). Rather, from my searching online, Russian-language websites usually refer to these as simply <em>«Валдайские шахматы»</em>, <em>Valdai chess pieces</em>, without any sobriquet.</p>
							
							<p>However, I did find some recent Russian-language auction listings calling these <em>«дворянские»</em> (dvoryanskiye) in inverted commas, &#34;noble&#34; in the adjective sense (i.e. not the nobles/boyars from Valdai but chessmen that are very noble). I wonder if in a roundabout way this may have come from Power! Power&#39;s style is to give all his refurbished sets both English names (all his Valdai sets are such-and-such &#34;Nobles&#34;, like &#34;High-Collared Nobles&#34;) and dog-Latin formal names, like &#34;Torquem Nobilis [sic]&#34;. Here &#34;nobilis&#34; could be read either as &#34;<em>a</em> noble&#34; or &#34;noble&#34; as an adjective, so perhaps Power&#39;s name led to <em>«Дворянские»</em> in a roundabout sort of way, via his Latin translation.</p>

							<p>Another possibility is that a term related to boyar was the endonym in one of the non-Russian minority Soviet languages. Whoever we owe the name to, <em>Valdai Nobles</em> has caught on as the name for this set in English-language auctions, helped by modern reproductions of the design using the same name. </p>
							
							<p>Russian luxury set manufacturer Kadun reproduce these under the name <em>Retro 70s</em> (<em>Ретро 70-х</em>). Their reproduction&#39;s stems are concave, like Soviet <em>Grandmaster</em> sets. </p>

							<p>Designed by Dadaist painter and sculpture Max Ernst (1891–1976) for the 1944 <em>Imagery of Chess</em> exhibition, one notable feature of this pattern is that the Queen is taller than the King. Ernst gave a set to Marcel Duchamp.</p>

							<hr/><h2>Indajesa Staunton</h2>
							
							<p>Mid-century Spanish manufacturer Indajesa&#39;s (<em>Industrias del Ajedrez</em>) take on the <em>Staunton</em>. Two pieces stand out the most. The Queen, who would stand taller than the King were it not for the King&#39;s finial, wears an unusual coronet  that looks like a rook&#39;s crenelations. The knight&#39;s angular design is wild, like a horse crossed with a dragon. </p>
							
							<p>Similar sets with slightly less striking knights were made by fellow Spanish company Marigo. The Indajesa design has been bought and revived by Barcelona-based manufacturer Mora Play.</p>

							<p>The <em>Lipnitsky</em> chessmen are named for Isaac Lipnitsky (1923-1959). Lipnitsky was a chess prodigy from Kiev, also known as the author of <em>Questions of Modern Chess Theory</em>. The chessmen that borrow his name are known from photographs of a 1946 Berlin chess tournament, organised by Lipnitsky.</p>
							
							<p>It is an uncommon set (Holger Langer thinks his is one of only around four surviving originals) but the pattern has been revived in reproductions.</p>
							
							<p>The most individual feature of the set is the wide, bell-like stems of the pawns. The knights are on pedestals. The King and Queen have typical Soviet-style heads and opposite finials. </p>

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Gothic</h2>
							
							<p>Russian-American sculptor Peter Ganine (1900—1974) designed several chess sets, including the <em>Gothic</em> (aka <em>Gothica</em> and <em>Superba</em>), where the pieces are caricature faces in mediaeval garb; the <em>Conqueror</em>, featuring full-length figural models in mediaeval garb; and the <em>Classic</em>, where the pieces have more conventional Staunton silhouettes. Ganine sets were mass produced in America in Bakelite plastic, based on ceramic originals.</p>
							
							<p>Ganine&#39;s <em>Gothic</em> pattern inspired similar sets like Drueke&#39;s <em>King Arthur</em> pieces. In the 1960s, Duncan Ceramic sold similar chessmen and molds, so that you could make and/or decorate your own clay chessmen. The <a href="https://worldchesshof.org/exhibition/featured-chess-sets-2022/">World Chess Hall of Fame featured a homemade Duncan on their website in January 2022</a> and provided a bit more detail.</p>
							
							<p>Ganine is also known for  patenting the rubber duck in the 40s. Ganine was born in Tbilisi, modern day Georgia, and lived in Los Angeles for most of his life.</p>

							<p>Romanian-pattern <em>Staunton</em> chessmen are very utilitarian, with no collars on pawns and the rooks lacking crenellations.

							<hr/><h2>Dubrovnik</h2>
							
							<p>This utilitarian design, by Petar Poček (1878–1963), was commissioned for the 1950 Chess Olympiad held in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia (modern day Croatia).</p>

							<p>Dubrovnik pieces are unweighted: instead, they are especially stout with wide bases to keep them steady. Famously, they were Bobby Fischer&#39;s favourite design. Only a small number of sets were originally made, but they became highly sought-after. Updated versions, Dubrovnik II and Dubrovnik Minčeta, were designed and produced in the 1960s.</p>

							<p>The knights have distinctive tucked-in heads. In common with other Communist-era sets, religious symbols like the cross on the King&#39;s crown or and groove in the bishop&#39;s mitre are missing. Bishops have opposite-coloured finials. Rooks have five merlons (parapets), to evoke the five-pointed star.</p>

(undated) Ei mikään puiseva juttu (&#39;Not boring&#39;, lit. &#39;not a wooden thing&#39;). SHAKKI magazine p26-29. [Finnish]">revived in the 1990s by Kalle Tanni and family</a>. Tanni called it the <em>Tyrvää</em> pattern, after the Tyrvää region of Finland, where the original examples were made.</p>
							
							<p>Concave stems. Kings and Queens of the same height, barring the finials, which are exaggerated on the kings. The kings finials are normally white for both sides. All the edges are very smooth and rounded (Lanier called a similar Finnish set &#34;Finnish smoothies&#34;). They are very <em>&#34;Scandinavian,&#34;</em> and remind me of the furniture of Finnish architect and designer Alvar Aalto. </p>

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Ganine Classic</h2>
							
							<p>Peter Ganine&#39;s other most enduring chess set pattern, along with the <em>Gothic</em> chess set of mediaeval faces (above), is his <em>Classic</em> pattern which revisits the traditional <em>Staunton</em> profile.</p>
							
							<p>The <em>Ganine Classic</em> pattern is famous as the set with which Spock and Kirk play &#34;tri-dimensional chess&#34; in <em>Star Trek</em>. As a result, in addition to the original Ganine pieces, the pattern was been revived in <em>Star Trek</em> merchandise and later again in the form of many online-distributed models for 3D printing.</p>

							<p>The knight has a tucked in chin, probably so that it is easier to cast in a mold, that resembles <em>Dubrovnik</em> knights. The other pieces feature a design motif with regularly spaced grooves cut out of the profile, so that the King, Queen, bishop, rook and pawn resemble honey spoons. It&#39;s like the pieces are only half there: it makes me think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlaced_video">interlaced video</a> broadcasts and imagine that the pieces, too, are in the middle of being &#34;beamed&#34; away on radio waves. </p>

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Seville 87</h2>
							<p>Seville in 1987 saw Garry Kasparov (1963–) and Anatoly Karpov (1951–) clash in the World Chess Championship. Spanish manufacturer Indajesa supplied the pieces for the games, with the unique rook design modeled on Seville&#39;s <em>Torre del Oro</em> commemorating the host city. </p> 
							
							<p>Indajesa later produced reproduction <em>Seville</em> sets with the same rook, but the rook is about all that everyone agrees on. There is some <a href="#footnotes" title="Some Chess.com discussion on the Seville set: THE SEVILLA SET ...That is not Sevilla set! and Spanish chess sets ...Seville 87">debate</a> over which is the correct knight: the rumour is that the set originally was conceived with typical <a href="#indajesa"><em>Indajesa</em>-style</a> Spanish knights but the players themselves asked for the substitution with <a href="#chavet"><em>Chavet</em>-style</a> knights instead. The reproduction set came with the <em>Chavet</em>-style knights.</p>
							
							<p>On the other hand, the reproduction&#39;s Queen, in <a href="#indajesa">typical Indajesan style</a> without prongs on her coronet or the orb finial, is certainly wrong per the photos.</p>
							
							<p>Fortunately, the reproduction of the rooks is accurate: the only debate there is over whether the <em>Torre del Oro</em> rooks are charming or ghastly. (I&#39;m in the former camp: usually it is in the knights where Stauntonate chess set designers show their originality, and it is pleasing to see a set where the rooks are more individual instead.) </p>
							
							<p>The cartoon above shows the version of the pieces in photos of the games, not the reproduction. This pattern, along with other Indajesa style Spanish Staunton and Spanish Regency style sets have been revived by Barcelona-based company <a href="https://www.mora-play.com/mora/en/">Mora-Play</a>. </p>

							</p></div>
							<hr/><h2>Zagreb 59</h2>
							
							<p>The <em>Zagreb</em> or <em>Zagreb 59</em> are popular <em>Staunton</em>-mode chessmen known for their uncomfortable-looking knights: horses heads with two ninety degree turns. </p>
							
							<p>From the name, one would think this design is based on the chessmen used in the 1959 Candidates tournament, held in Bled, Zagreb, and Belgrade. This appears to just be marketing: no photo of such pieces from the tournament have surfaced. Rather, photos and <a href="#footnotes" title="RTV SLO (1959). MEDNARODNI ŠAHOVSKI TURNIR NA BLEDU. Slovenia. Via EU Screen.">footage</a> from Bled show what appear to be <em>Dubrovnik</em>-pattern pieces.</p>
							
							<p>The <em>Zagreb</em> pattern appears to originate in the &#39;90s or &#39;00s from Frank Camaratta&#39;s House of Staunton, which <a href="#footnotes" title="House of Staunton Zagreb &#39;59 series (2003) as archived by web.archive.org.">described them</a> as &#34;accurate reproductions of one of the most popular chess sets used in the major International tournaments during the 1950s and 1960s&#34; made &#34;to commemorate that classic struggle [the 1959 tournament]&#34;. Authenticity aside, they are nevertheless very popular, and other manufacturers have their own lines with similar broken-back knights under a variety of names like <em>Leningrad</em> or <em>Yugoslavian</em>. </p>

							<p>This pattern may be especially recognisable to those people who for some reason are more interested in playing chess, rather than collecting chess sets (or indeed, drawing them for an infographic), as it was with these chessmen Magnus Carlsen (1990–) won the Candidates and defeated Viswanathan Anand (1969–) to become World Chess Champion. </p>
