      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Here&#39;s a very plausible threat: Some developer with a left-pad package, some dependency-of-a-dependency, injects malware into their library. A developer (who is broadly trustworthy) updates their package&#39;s dependencies without auditing them properly, and the malware ends up in a VSCode plugin that you use. You open VSCode, your system is infected.<p>We know this sort of malware is making its way onto package repositories [1]. We know people are falling for these attacks. How do we protect ourselves against this family of threats?</p><p>[1]: https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/21/npm_malware_password/</p><p>We could trust nothing beyond our base system and our browser, and refuse to use any code we don&#39;t fully audit, but this would be an impossibly austere way to live. I expect most of us, when pressed, would admit that we&#39;re trusting much more code than we would like to.</p><p>The alternative is sandboxing, using a lightweight option like firejail (which I use) or a totalizing system like QubesOS. But these systems are awkward to use, and have their own drawbacks.</p><p>What&#39;s the bar for reasonable security, in your opinion? How do you secure your workstation without living like a monk?</p></td></tr>
