<em>Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of
		  Computational Agents</em>, 3rd edition by
	<a href="https://cs.ubc.ca/~poole/">David L. Poole</a> and 
  			<a href="https://cs.ubc.ca/~mack/">Alan K. Mackworth</a>,	  <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/artificial-intelligence/C113F6CE284AB00F5489EBA5A59B93B7">Cambridge University Press</a>
			2023, is a book about the
science of artificial intelligence (AI). It presents artificial
intelligence as the study of
the design of intelligent computational agents. The book is structured
as a textbook, but it is accessible to a wide audience of
professionals and researchers.
In the last decades we have witnessed the emergence of artificial
intelligence as a serious science and engineering discipline. This
book provides an accessible synthesis of the field aimed at undergraduate and
graduate students.
It provides a coherent vision of the foundations of the field as it is today. It
aims to provide that synthesis as an integrated science, in terms of a
multi-dimensional
design space that has been partially explored. As with any science
worth its salt,
artificial intelligence has a coherent, formal theory and a
rambunctious experimental wing.
The book balances theory and experiment, showing how to link them
intimately together.
It develops the science of AI together with its engineering applications.

   <ul>
<li>This is an important textbook. Based on their broad experience, the authors harmonize some of the most exciting recent developments in the field, such as generative AI, with more traditional methods, within a unified agent framework. This will broaden the perspective of those relatively new to the field, for whom AI and deep learning appear almost synonymous.</li>  
<b>-- Yoav Shoham - Stanford University and AI21 Labs</b>
<li>This book is a tour de force. It provides a comprehensive introduction to so many topics in modern AI. The clarity of the exposition and the ability to capture the intuition underlying complex concepts make this book compelling and appealing to a broad audience.</li>  
<b>-- Pascal Van Hentenryck - Georgia Institute of Technology</b>
<li>This new edition offers an up-to-date account of AI, presenting the field in an accessible and unified manner. I particularly like the &#34;relations-late&#34; approach, in which first-order logic and relational AI are covered later, after thoroughly covering more basic, feature-based methods. The hybrid data-driven/model-based approach to agent design that the authors propose will be essential to the development of reliable and trustworthy intelligent systems.</li>  
<b>-- Kevin Patrick Murphy - Google Brain, author of Probabilistic Machine Learning</b>
<li>Poole and Mackworth&#39;s now classic textbook has guided my senior undergraduate AI class since its first edition. Coupled with online resources, the book presents a comprehensive overview, with technical substance and many pointers for further study, in a coherent structure that fosters learning of key interrelated concepts. The third edition updates the content to cover the massive recent AI advances.</li>  
<b>-- Jesse Hoey - University of Waterloo</b>
<li>Machine learning has undergone spectacular advances over the last few years, but to harvest the new capabilities one needs an engineering framework to build computational agents. This book teaches students about the concepts and techniques that make that possible.</li>  
<b>-- Rodney Brooks - MIT and Robust AI</b>
