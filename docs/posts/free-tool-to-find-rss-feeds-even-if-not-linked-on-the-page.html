    <h1>Show HN: Free tool to find RSS feeds, even if not linked on the page</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>I developed a small tool to find RSS feeds for websites. You can try it out here: <a href="https://lighthouseapp.io/tools/feed-finder" rel="nofollow">https://lighthouseapp.io/tools/feed-finder</a></p><p>In &gt;90% of cases the standard way of checking meta tags is enough to find the feeds. But my goal for this tool is that it finds feeds regardless if they&#39;re linked somewhere or not. That if this feed finder doesn&#39;t find a feed, no feed exists.</p><p>It&#39;s a big goal and admittedly not there yet, but it does a few things that are a step in that direction.</p><p>* Checks meta tags of parent pages (sometimes the article itself doesn&#39;t have the meta tag, but the main blog page does)</p><p>* Checks common suffixes like /rss, /index.xml and many others (sometimes the feed exists but isn&#39;t linked)</p><p>* Checks the sitemap</p><p>* Checks all links on the page</p><p>* Checks 3rd party feeds (OpenRSS for now, when I find more such repositories I&#39;ll add them too)</p><p>There are a couple of additional ideas I have, like checking search engines and crawling the entire domain (highly inefficient, but possible).</p><p>Would love if you could try it, and even more if you post sites where it doesn&#39;t work.</p></div></td></div></div>
