    <h1>U.S. Tech Layoffs Hit Two-Decade High in October</h1>

									<p data-start="167" data-end="547">October 2025 brought a sharp and unsettling turn in the U.S. labour market: employers announced <strong data-start="263" data-end="283">153,074 job cuts</strong>, the highest for any October in more than two decades. The data from consulting firm <a href="https://www.challengergray.com/blog/october-challenger-report-153074-job-cuts-on-cost-cutting-ai/"><em>Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas</em></a> reveals that the wave of reductions is broadening beyond isolated sectors, signalling deeper structural shifts.</p><p data-start="549" data-end="961">One of the standout features is the surge in the technology sector. Tech companies reported <strong data-start="641" data-end="673">33,281 job-cut announcements</strong> in October alone — up sharply from just 5,639 in September. Year-to-date through October, tech firms had a combined <strong data-start="828" data-end="848">141,159 job cuts</strong>, representing roughly a 17 % increase compared to the same period in 2024.</p>								</div>

									<p data-start="963" data-end="1434">Several drivers are converging to produce this uptick. Cost-cutting is cited as a leading reason, alongside automation and the rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Firms are restructuring amid slower consumer demand, rising input costs and the need to adapt to next-generation technologies. For workers, this means that the low-firing environment of recent years is giving way to a more volatile job market.</p><p data-start="1436" data-end="1910">The implications extend beyond individuals. For digital publishers, blogs and content-platforms like ours, a pullback in workforce and corporate spending may translate into changes in advertising budgets, affiliate-marketing partnerships and content demand. Strategically, this is a moment to focus on stories such as: how workers can pivot their careers, the ripple effects on freelancers and agencies, and how companies are managing the transition to AI-enabled workflows.</p><p data-start="1912" data-end="2222">In short: the October spike in layoffs is more than a statistical blip—it reflects a shifting employment landscape, one in which technology firms once seen as growth engines are recalibrating and reshaping their workforces. For creators, entrepreneurs and professionals alike, adaptation is no longer optional.</p>								</div>
