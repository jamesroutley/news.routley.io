    <h1>RevisionDojo, a YC startup, is running astroturfing campaigns targeting kids</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>RevisionDojo is a YC-backed test prep company ($3.4M raised) that sells International Baccalaureate (IB) test prep. Over the past year, users on r/IBO sub-reddit have documented a pattern of unethical marketing practices:</p><p>*Astroturfing:* Coordinated campaigns where accounts pose as students sharing &#34;cheatsheets&#34; and &#34;predicted exam leaks.&#34; Other accounts then upvote, leave supportive comments, and ask follow-up questions—creating the illusion of organic student excitement. Multiple threads have exposed this pattern [1][2][3].</p><p>*Paid fake posts:* High school students report being offered payment to write promotional Reddit posts [4].</p><p>*Pressuring critics:* Users who post negative reviews report being contacted directly by company representatives, told it&#39;s &#34;a shame&#34; they&#39;re posting publicly [5]. Critical comments receive coordinated mass downvotes [6].</p><p>*Soliciting copyrighted materials:* They use TikTok influencers and fake reddit posts to persuade students to sell them official IB exam papers, violating IB policies [7].</p><p>The r/IBO moderators are actively investigating [8].</p><p>These practices appear to be working great for them. Recently, they acquired OnePrep (oneprep.xyz), a free SAT prep tool that was already popular on r/sat. Since the acquisition, the same manipulation tactics have been deployed at scale: 150 Trustpilot reviews in a window of a few days [9], and widespread coordinated Reddit manipulation—multiple accounts posting &#34;tips&#34; that recommend Oneprep, coordinated upvoting, and fake enthusiasm in comments. The most prominent example was a 2,000+ upvote post removed by moderators for manipulation, but it&#39;s part of a sustained campaign across the subreddit.</p><p>*Sources:*</p><p>[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1p55qun/
