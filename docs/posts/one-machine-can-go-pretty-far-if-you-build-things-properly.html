    <h1>One machine can go pretty far if you build things properly</h1>
    
    
<p>
Okay, so yesterday I 
<a href="/w/2022/01/26/swcbbs/">posted</a>
a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had 
apparently taken over an entire bedroom with dozens of computers.  I 
mentioned that I intended to come back to the topic to throw in my own 
two cents, and so here we go.
</p><p>
When you looked at that picture, which way did you react?  Were you one 
of the people who looked at it and thought it was remarkable, and wished 
you could "drive" such a setup?  All of those machines, all needing to 
be built out and set up, just so your stuff could scale.
</p><p>
Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?
</p><p>
I'll admit: when I first saw that picture in 1993, I was in awe of the 
scale.  It had never occurred to me what kind of layout you would need 
to run some of these systems at that level of scale.  Some small part of 
me probably wanted to at least experience that, but I never actually 
went that far.
</p><p>
Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost 
opportunities.  The actual amount of work being done on behalf of any of 
the users who are connected is tiny.  If we ignore the fact that the 
actual BBS software and related accessories (door games...) forced them 
to run DOS and just focused on the other elements, it becomes possible 
to see an alternative.
</p><p>
If you wanted to solve for the base problem of having a bunch of people
dialing into a machine that would send and receive files, read and write 
messages, and yes, even playing some games, that did not require a 
basement full of computers, not even in 1993.  Universities, ISPs, and 
even a couple of forward-thinking high schools were doing exactly that 
at that time.
</p><p>
There are *large* parallels from those two approaches to what I've been 
seeing more of as the years have gone by.  There are people who go into 
a situation assuming that they are going to want a whole cluster of 
machines to do their thing.  It doesn't matter that what they are 
actually doing should be a tiny amount of complexity and it should all 
fit on one box... or maybe two for some redundancy.  They've decided it 
will have a measurable "footprint" and by god, they're going to make it 
happen that way.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, someone else who just wants it done comes up with a better 
approach that actually cares about efficiency, fits it onto the one or 
two boxes mentioned before, stands it up, and goes on with life.
</p><p>
Part of this has to do with what kind of tools you choose to use.  If 
you are sticking with the 2022 equivalent of MS-DOS and machines that 
do exactly one thing at a time, then yeah, you are going to have a whole 
fleet of systems all sitting there busy-waiting on something stupid.  
</p><p>
Or, you can make better choices and just have a boring little setup that 
sits there and crunches through anything you might possibly throw at it.  
Oh, sure, eventually your business might get big enough to where you 
have to scale it up, but *IF* (not when) that happens, then you can 
worry about it.
</p><p>
Don't recreate the basement full of PCs when the problem can actually be 
solved with a single box sitting in a cabinet somewhere.  Put away the 
urge to check off all of those boxes on your next job search by making 
your current employer pay for your wasteful shenanigans.  Do the right 
thing and screw around with performance art on your own time.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Epilogue: in the hours after writing yesterday's post, I spotted a 
couple of things which seemed to hit this same point, and so I will 
share some links with you.
</p><p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://christine.website/blog/make-microservices-cluster-2022-01-27">"How do I make the cluster though?"  "Don't".</a>
</p><p>
... and ...
</p><p>
<li><a href="https://crawshaw.io/blog/one-process-programming-notes">"1 VM, 1 Zone, 1 process programming"</a>
</ul>
</p><p>
This is not to say I agree with everything in all of those posts, but I 
do like the way they remind people that one or two decent machines can 
probably do the job... assuming you don't just burn money by building 
things badly.
</p><p>
Finally, I'll also use this opportunity to again share the link to the
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos15/hotos15-paper-mcsherry.pdf">COST paper</a>.
</p><p>
I love this quote:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
You can have a second computer once you've shown you know how to use the 
first one.

After all, how can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
