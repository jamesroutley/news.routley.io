                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <p>If you go to the <a href="https://museupicassobcn.cat/en"> Museu
                                    Picasso in Barcelona</a>, you&#39;ll
                                see many of the artist&#39;s early works. They&#39;re really interesting because they don&#39;t look
                                like what we think of as
                                Picasso&#39;s style. These paintings, completed during his early years, are
                                displays of his technical genius - as a classical painter. </p>

                            <p>Some particularly amazing examples are &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_Charity">Science
                                    and Charity</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/first-communion-1896">First
                                    Communion</a>&#34;. One of my favorites is &#34;Portrait of the
                                Artist&#39;s Mother.&#34; These were all painted when he was fifteen. </p>

                            <p> You can see
                                both the artist&#39;s
                                innate ability to make art, and his immense potential future. But to get to the point
                                where Picasso could reject traditional styles, he had
                                to master them first.
                            </p>

                            <p> This is also true for machine learning.
                                There&#39;s a
                                whole universe
                                of exciting developments at the forefront of large language models. But in the noise of
                                the bleeding edge, a lot of
                                important
                                foundational concepts get lost. If we don&#39;t
                                <a href="https://increment.com/software-architecture/architecture-for-generations/">
                                    understand the fundamentals</a> of how we get from a single word to a BERT
                                representation, and more importantly, why we do so,
                                the models will remain black boxes to us. We won&#39;t be able to build on them and
                                master them in the ways
                                that we want.
                            </p>

                            <p> Peter Norvig urges us to <a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html">teach ourselves programming in ten
                                    years</a>. In this spirit, after several years of working with embeddings,
                                foundational data structures in deep learning models, I realized it&#39;s not trivial to
                                have a good conceptual model of them. Moreover, when I did
                                want to learn more, there was no
                                good, general text I could refer to as a starting point. Everything was either too deep
                                and academic or too shallow and content from vendors in the space selling their
                                solution.
                                
                                So I started a project to understand the
                                fundamental building blocks of machine learning and natural language processing,
                                particularly as they relate to recommendation systems today. The results of this
                                project are the PDF on this site, which is aimed at a generalist audience and not trying
                                to sell you anything except the idea that vectors are cool. I&#39;ve also been working on <a href="http://viberary.pizza">Viberary</a> to implement these ideas in practice.</p>

                            <p> In addition to his art, Picasso also left us with the quote,

                            <p> I wrote this text for my own learning process. But it&#39;s my
                                hope that this
                                document puts embeddings in a business and engineering context so that others including
                                engineers, PMs, students, and
                                anyone
                                looking to
                                learn more about
                                fundamentals finds it useful.</p>

                            <p>Machine learning, like all good engineering and like good art, is
                                ultimately, a way for us to express ourselves, a craft made up of fundamental building
                                blocks and patterns that empower us and
                                allow us to build something
                                beautiful on strong foundations of those that came before us. and I hope you find as
                                much joy in exploring embeddings and using them
                                as I did.</p>
