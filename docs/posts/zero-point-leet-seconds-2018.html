  While computing certain round-trip times, here is a number I came
  across that is not easy to forget: It takes light 0.1337 seconds to
  travel once around the Earth&#39;s equator via vacuum or air. Let me
  repeat that. It takes light &#34;zero point leet&#34; seconds to travel once
  around the equator.
</p>
<p>
  The equatorial radius of the Earth is about 6378.137 km. The
  equatorial circumference of the Earth then is about 40075 km. The
  speed of light in vacuum is 299792.458 km/s by definition. The speed
  of light in air is about 299705 km/s. Therefore, it takes light
  about 40075/299792.458 seconds in vacuum and about 40075/299705
  seconds in air to travel once around the equator. Both values can be
  written as 0.1337 seconds accurate up to 4 decimal places.
