Will it be able to cope with climate change?</b></p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Cecilia Tortajada recalls making her way down a long staircase and into of one of Japan’s engineering marvels, an enormous water tank that crowns Tokyo’s defences against flooding. When she finally reached the tank’s ground, she stood among the dozens of 500-tonne pillars supporting the ceiling. In the cavernous, shrine-like cistern, she felt humbled.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>If Japan is a pilgrimage destination for disaster and risk-management experts like her, this is one of its main temples. The floodwater cathedral hidden 22 meters underground is part of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Area_Outer_Underground_Discharge_Channel">the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC),</a> a 6.3 km long system of tunnels and towering cylindrical chambers that protect North Tokyo from flooding.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>In the past several decades, the Japanese capital perfected the art of coping with typhonic rains and moody rivers, and its intricate flood defence system is a global wonder. But the future seems uncertain as the climate changes and rain patterns shift.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Tokyo’s battle with flooding stretches back through its history. The city sits on a plain crossed by five rowdy river systems and dozens of individual rivers that naturally swell each season. Intense urbanisation, rapid industrialisation and imprudent water extraction that caused some regions to sink have exacerbated the city’s vulnerability.</p></div></div><div data-component="video-block"><figure><div><div></div></div><p><figcaption>Inside Tokyo&#39;s floodwater cathedrals</figcaption></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><i id="view-a-stunning-tour-of-the-floodwater-cathedral-above">View a stunning tour of the floodwater cathedral above</i></p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>“I don’t know who decided to set-up Tokyo there,” Tortajada, who’s worked in water management for over two decades, says only half-jokingly.  </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Even if Japan has dealt with floods for centuries, Tokyo’s current system truly started to take shape in the post-war years. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_Pacific_typhoon_season#Typhoon_Kathleen">Typhoon Kathleen</a> hit in 1947, destroying around 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people; one decade later Typhoon Kanogawa (also known as Ida) devastated the city when around 400mm of rain in a week. Streets, homes and businesses were inundated.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Amidst the chaotic aftermath, the Japanese government stepped up its monetary commitment.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>“Even in the 1950s and 1960s, when the Japanese were recovering from the war, the government was investing 6-7% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction,” explains <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jica.go.jp/usa/english/office/others/newsletter/2013/1307_08_04.html">Miki Inaoka</a>, a disaster expert at the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Tokyo’s planners must be wary of serveral different kind of floods. If heavy rain falls upstream, maybe a river breaks it banks and inundates a centric neighbourhood downstream. Perhaps a downpour in the city overpowers that area’s drainage system or a high tide or tsunami could threaten the coastline. What if an earthquake destroys a dam or a levee?</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>After decades of planning for these scenarios and non-stop construction, the Japanese capital now boasts dozens of dams, reservoirs and levees. Cut into the city’s ground, as you would with a birthday cake, and you will find an underground maze of tunnels alongside the subway lines and gas pipelines that criss-cross the city.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The $2 billion Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC) and its ‘floodwater cathedral’ is one of the capital’s most impressive engineering feats. Completed in 2006 after 13 years of works, it is the world’s largest diversion floodwater facility and the result of Tokyo’s continuous improvement efforts.  </p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p06t5qt7.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p06t5qt7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p06t5qt7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p06t5qt7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p06t5qt7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p06t5qt7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p06t5qt7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p06t5qt7.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p06t5qt7.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p06t5qt7.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Tokyo&#39;s rivers - so beautiful for much of the year - can pose a danger in times of heavy rainfall (Credit: Getty Images)"/><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p><figcaption>Tokyo&#39;s rivers - so beautiful for much of the year - can pose a danger in times of heavy rainfall (Credit: Getty Images)</figcaption></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>“Japan is a country that believes in learning,”, says Tortajada, who visited the MAOUDC in 2017. “That makes it a very interesting case for study.”</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The Channel sucks in water from small- and mid-size rivers in Northern Tokyo and moves it to the bigger Edo River, which can handle the volume with more ease.</p></div></div><div data-component="quote-block"><div><div><div><p><span>Each of these tanks is big enough to accommodate a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty</span></p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>When one of these rivers overflows, the water falls to one of five enormous 70-meter tall cylindrical tanks spread across the Channel’s length. Each of these tanks is big enough to accommodate a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty and they are interconnected through a 6.3km long network of underground tunnels. As the water approaches the Edo River, the ‘floodwater cathedral’ Tortajada visited reduces its flow, so the pumps can push it to the river.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>A mental exercise can explain the potency of the Discharge Channel. Imagine a standard 25m pool, filled to the brim, connected to the 13,000 horse power pumps that release water from the Channel. If the pumps went on, if would only take them two to three seconds to empty the pool, as they can push 200 tons of water per second.</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p06t5qdw.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p06t5qdw.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p06t5qdw.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p06t5qdw.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p06t5qdw.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p06t5qdw.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p06t5qdw.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p06t5qdw.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p06t5qdw.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p06t5qdw.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The pumps in the Discharge Channel could empty a 25m swimming pool in less than three seconds (Credit: Getty Images)"/><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p><figcaption>The pumps in the Discharge Channel could empty a 25m swimming pool in less than three seconds (Credit: Getty Images)</figcaption></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>“It’s like a science-fiction kind of facility,” says JICA’s Inaoka, whose job involves collaborating with experts from developing countries to share Japan’s expertise.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Yet Inaoka also acknowledges that changing patterns in rainfall will challenge Tokyo’s infrastructure. Climate change makes it very hard to plan ahead, she says.  </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Based on historical rainfall records, the city planning authorities designed Tokyo’s defences to withstand up to 50 millimetres of rain per hour, particularly in areas were people and property are concentrated. But what was considered normal fifty years ago is not anymore.  </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Bureau of Construction <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kensetsu.metro.tokyo.jp/english/jigyo/river/03.html">claims to be aware of these shifts and has raised the rainfall criteria</a> in response. In at least three areas, projects are now built to withstand between 65 and 75mm of rain per hour. But experts like Nobukuyi Tsuchiya, former chief civil engineer of Tokyo’s Edogawa ward, say the authorities are lingering too long on discussing what to do.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>“Unfortunately, the flood control action in vision of climate change has not yet been established in Japan,” says Tsuchiya, director of the Japan Riverfront Research Centre. </p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p06t5pbv.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p06t5pbv.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p06t5pbv.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p06t5pbv.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p06t5pbv.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p06t5pbv.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p06t5pbv.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p06t5pbv.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p06t5pbv.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p06t5pbv.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge and its floodwater cathedral cost $2 billion to build (Credit: Getty Images)"/><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p><figcaption>The Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge and its floodwater cathedral cost $2 billion to build (Credit: Getty Images)</figcaption></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>In his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shuto-suibotsu-Nobuyuki-Tsuchiya/dp/4166609807">2014 book “Shuto Suibotsu”</a> (‘Capital Submerged’), Tsuchiya warns that Tokyo is not prepared to deal with the downpours that could arrive with with global warming. On the low-lying areas of Tokyo, around 2.5 million people could be affected by flooding in the event of record-high tides and their fate should be a major planning priority, says the Japanese expert. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Earlier in 2018, heavy rains in Western Japan killed hundreds of people and caused millions in economic damages as rivers burst their banks and overflowed.
