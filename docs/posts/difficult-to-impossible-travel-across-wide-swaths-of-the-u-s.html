                Two powerful winter storms will bring widespread areas of wintry precipitation from coast to coast. Heavy snow, significant icing, and blizzard conditions are possible in portions of the Upper Midwest eastward into the Northeast. Heavy rain, snow, wind, and cold temperatures will affect much of California through the end of the week. Dangerous travel conditions are expected.
