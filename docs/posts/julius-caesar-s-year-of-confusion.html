Looking at this calendar with modern eyes, you might feel a bit short-changed. There are only 10 months in it, starting in March in spring, and the tenth and final month of the year is what we now know as December. Six of those months had 30 days, and four had 31 days – <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-why-is-february-shorter-than-every-other-month-176915">giving a total of 304 days<!-- --></a>.

The Sun rises and falls but, according to the early Roman calendar, no day has officially passed. &#34;Which is where the complications start to come in.&#34;<!-- --></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="text-block"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-why-is-february-shorter-than-every-other-month-176915">In 731BC, the second King of Rome, Numa Pompilius<!-- --></a>, decided to improve the calendar by introducing extra months to cover that winter period. &#34;Because what&#39;s the point in a calendar that only covers part of the year?&#34; Parish says. Pompilius&#39; answer was to add 51 days to the calendar, creating what we now call January and February. This extension brought the calendar year up to 355 days.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>If 355 days seems like an odd number for Pompilius to aim for, that was on purpose. The number takes its reference from the lunar year (12 lunar months), <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/year#ref120292">which is 354 days long<!-- --></a>. However, &#34;because of Roman superstitions about even numbers, an additional day is added to make 355&#34;, says Parish.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>In this rejig, the months were arranged in such a way that all had odd numbers of days, except for February, with 28. &#34;Therefore it&#39;s considered unlucky and the time of social, cultural and political purification,&#34; says Parish. &#34;So that&#39;s the point at which you try and wipe the slate clean.&#34;<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>It&#39;s good progress, says Parish, but it&#39;s still around 11 days out from the Solar year of 365-and-a-bit days. &#34;Even with this souped-up calendar from Pompilius, it&#39;s very easy for the calendar to get out of synchronisation with the seasons.&#34;<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>By around 200BC things had got sufficiently bad that a near-total eclipse of the Sun was observed in Rome on what we would now consider to be 14 March, but is recorded as having taken place on 11 July.<!-- --></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="text-block"><p>Because the calendar had by this point gone &#34;so catastrophically wrong&#34;, Parish says, the Emperor and priests in Rome resorted to inserting <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/mercedonius/">an additional &#34;intercalary&#34; month, Mercedonius<!-- --></a>, on an ad-hoc basis to try to realign the calendar to the seasons.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>This did not work out very well. There was a tendency to add Mercedonius when favoured public officials were in power, for instance, rather than strictly to align the calendar with the seasons.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html">The classical writer and historian Suetonius complained<!-- --></a> that &#34;the negligence of the pontiffs had long since so disordered [the calendar], through their privilege of adding months or days at pleasure, that the harvest festivals did not come in summer nor those of the vintage in the autumn&#34;.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Which brings us back to Julius Caesar.

Then they start at seven – so seven, eight, nine, 10. So they&#39;re accidentally double-counting one of those years each time. It doesn&#39;t take long to realise that slippage is starting to occur.&#34;<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/home.html">This was corrected in the reign of Augustus<!-- --></a> and leap years happened every four years instead of every three, and then the Julian calendar was well on its way. &#34;Julius Caesar is getting it almost bang on where the calendar needs to be,&#34; says Parish.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>It might have been the only calendar needed for the job, if the Earth did in fact do a neat extra quarter-turn each year.
