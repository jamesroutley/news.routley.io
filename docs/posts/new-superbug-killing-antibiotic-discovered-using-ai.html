However, there has been a lack of new drugs for decades and bacteria are becoming harder to treat, as they evolve resistance to the ones we have. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2022-01-20-estimated-12-million-people-died-2019-antibiotic-resistant-bacterial-infections">More than a million people a year</a> are estimated to die from infections that resist treatment with antibiotics. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The researchers focused on one of the most problematic species of bacteria - <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, which can infect wounds and cause pneumonia.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>You may not have heard of it, but it is one of the three superbugs the World Health Organization has identified as <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-needed">a &#34;critical&#34; threat</a>. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is often able to shrug off multiple antibiotics and is a problem in hospitals and care homes, where it can survive on surfaces and medical equipment.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Dr Jonathan Stokes, from McMaster University, describes the bug as &#34;public enemy number one&#34; as it&#39;s &#34;really common&#34; to find cases where it is &#34;resistant to nearly every antibiotic&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>McMaster University </span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Dr Jonathan Stokes</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Artificial-intelligence"><span role="text">Artificial intelligence</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>To find a new antibiotic, the researchers first had to train the AI. They took thousands of drugs where the precise chemical structure was known, and manually tested them on <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> to see which could slow it down or kill it. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This information was fed into the AI so it could learn the chemical features of drugs that could attack the problematic bacterium. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The AI was then unleashed on a list of 6,680 compounds whose effectiveness was unknown. The results - <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01349-8">published in Nature Chemical Biology</a> - showed it took the AI an hour and a half to produce a shortlist. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The researchers tested 240 in the laboratory, and found nine potential antibiotics. One of them was the incredibly potent antibiotic abaucin.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Laboratory experiments showed it could treat infected wounds in mice and was able to kill <i>A. baumannii</i> samples from patients. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, Dr Stokes told me: &#34;This is when the work starts.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The next step is to perfect the drug in the laboratory and then perform clinical trials. He expects the first AI antibiotics could take until 2030 until they are available to be prescribed. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Curiously, this experimental antibiotic had no effect on other species of bacteria, and works only on <i>A. baumannii</i>. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Many antibiotics kill bacteria indiscriminately. The researchers believe the precision of abaucin will make it harder for drug-resistance to emerge, and could lead to fewer side-effects. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Bacteria being grown in the laboratory</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In principle, the AI could screen tens of millions of potential compounds - something that would be impractical to do manually.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;AI enhances the rate, and in a perfect world decreases the cost, with which we can discover these new classes of antibiotic that we desperately need,&#34; Dr Stokes told me.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The researchers tested the principles of AI-aided antibiotic discovery <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51586010">in E. coli in 2020</a>, but have now used that knowledge to focus on the big nasties. They plan to look at <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> next.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;This finding further supports the premise that AI can significantly accelerate and expand our search for novel antibiotics,&#34; said Prof James Collins, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He added: &#34;I&#39;m excited that this work shows that we can use AI to help combat problematic pathogens such as A. baumannii.&#34;</p></div></article></div></div>
