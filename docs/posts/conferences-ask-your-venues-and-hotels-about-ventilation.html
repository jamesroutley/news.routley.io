<p>(I also asked about masking policies in the hotels and in Salt Lake City, since <a href="https://whattoexpect.marriott.com/slcut">the Marriott hotel info</a> said their rules would depend on local laws/ordinances.)</p><p><b>Kudos to PyCon!</b> They asked their health consultant to look into these questions and updated <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/attend/health-safety-guidelines/">their health and safety page</a> with <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/documents/1/Updated_as_of_2.10.22.Covid-19_Report_Pycon_US_2.7.22.pdf">a report on the hotels, local rules, local statistics, and so on</a>. The Hilton attests to high filtration standards for their ventilation, and the consultant is looking into the situation at the Marriott.</p><p>Lots of companies try to impress you by saying they&#39;ve increased how often or how thoroughly they clean surfaces. That&#39;s great for catching fewer colds, but COVID is airborne, so we need to be asking how often and how thoroughly they&#39;re cleaning the air. I&#39;d love to see air exchange rates, CO2 monitoring, and similar statistics and thresholds in the &#34;please come back, look how clean and safe we are&#34; ads.</p><p>Feel free to copy my wording to ask your event organizers about ventilation!</p><p><code>*</code> And for several reasons -- health, fatigue, climate impact, national borders, cost, scheduling, etc. -- in-person may not be an option, for me and many others. This post isn&#39;t about that but I&#39;m aware.</p>
