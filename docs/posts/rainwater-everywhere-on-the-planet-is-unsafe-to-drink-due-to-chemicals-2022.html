																																	<p>Commonly known as &#39;forever chemicals&#39; because they disintegrate extremely slowly, PFAS (per- and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/polyfluoroalkyl+substances/" rel="tag">polyfluoroalkyl substances</a>) were initially found in packaging, shampoo or makeup but have spread to our entire environment, including water and air.</p>
<p>&#34;There is nowhere on Earth where the rain would be safe to drink, according to the measurements that we have taken,&#34; Ian Cousins, a professor at the university and the lead author of the study published in <i>Environmental Science and Technology</i>, told AFP.</p>
<p>A compilation of the data since 2010 that his team studied showed that &#34;even in Antarctica or the Tibetan plateau, the levels in the rainwater are above the drinking water guidelines that the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) proposed&#34;, he said.</p>
<p>Normally considered pristine, the two regions still have PFAS levels &#34;14 times higher&#34; than the US drinking water guidelines.</p>
<p>The EPA recently lowered its PFAS guidelines significantly after discovering that the chemicals may affect the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/immune+response/" rel="tag">immune response</a> in children to vaccines, Cousins noted.</p>
<p>Once ingested, PFAS accumulate in the body.</p>
<p>According to some studies, exposure can also lead to problems with fertility, <a href="https://phys.org/tags/developmental+delays/" rel="tag">developmental delays</a> in children, increased risks of obesity or certain cancers (prostate, kidney and testicular), an increase in <a href="https://phys.org/tags/cholesterol+levels/" rel="tag">cholesterol levels</a>.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Cousins said PFAS were now &#34;so persistent&#34; and ubiquitous that they will never disappear from the planet.</p>
<p>&#34;We have made the planet inhospitable to human life by irreversibly contaminating it now so that nothing is clean anymore. And to the point that&#39;s it&#39;s not clean enough to be safe&#34;, he said.</p>
<p>&#34;We have crossed a planetary boundary&#34;, he said, referring to a central paradigm for evaluating Earth&#39;s capacity to absorb the impact of human activity.</p>
<p>However, Cousins noted that PFAS levels in people have actually dropped &#34;quite significantly in the last 20 years&#34; and &#34;ambient levels (of PFAS in the environment) have been the same for the past 20 years&#34;.</p>
<p>&#34;What&#39;s changed is the guidelines. They&#39;ve gone down millions of times since the early 2000s, because we&#39;ve learned more about the toxicity of these substances.&#34;</p>
<p>Cousins said we have to learn to live with it.</p>
<p>&#34;I&#39;m not super concerned about the everyday exposure in mountain or stream <a href="https://phys.org/tags/water/" rel="tag">water</a> or in the food. We can&#39;t escape it... we&#39;re just going to have to live with it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;But it&#39;s not a great situation to be in, where we&#39;ve contaminated the environment to the point where background exposure is not really safe.&#34;</p>
