        A recent meta-analysis in this journal (Taylor et al 2025) produced ostensible evidence
of a negative correlation between fluoride exposure and intelligence in children, which garnered
major public attention. There has, however, been criticism of this undertaking and conclusions.
In order to address the controversy over this work, we in this special communication undertake
an independent forensic meta-science review of the methodology and statistical approaches
employed and inferences drawn by the authors, as well as an investigation of the underlying data
integrity of the constituent studies. We find that the authors employed unjustified methodological
and statistical errors which invalidate their conclusion, and demonstrate that the data cannot be
analysed as the authors assert. We further find major problems with the sources employed,
including reliance on studies from non-MEDLINE indexed publications with an anti-fluoridation
editorial stance, and major underlying issues with the data reported in several instances,
indicative of impossible or unreliable data. Taylor et al is not reliable nor are its errors
remediable. It should be retracted to avoid harms to public health and scientific discourse.
