    <h1>Interview gone wrong</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I have a very basic question which I usually ask in a interview which is to implement a tic tac toe game. I like this because the logic is straightforward and it helps to judge things like code quality / speed / conciseness etc.</p><p>The candidate this time was programming in python and had put a statement to figure out if we have a winner by checking if all the elements in the diagonal position are the same.</p><pre><code>if (cell[0][0] == cell[1][1] == cell[2][2]) {
    return Winner
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>cell[x][y]</code> can contain a char where the value would be either <code>&#39;-&#39;</code> or <code>&#39;X&#39;</code> or <code>&#39;Y&#39;</code></p><p>I didn&#39;t want to nit pick but it felt that the statement even though logical, is not technically right, because if we start from the left <code>cell[0][0] == cell[1][1]</code> would evaluate to <code>True</code> and then <code>True == cell[2][2]</code> would evaluate to <code>False</code> given that the cell contains a char.</p><p>And this is how it would definitely happen if the code was written in <code>javascript</code> </p><p>I told the candidate about the same and he agreed but he was confused at the same time stating that he has used / seen this expression multiple times in the existing codebase.</p><p>After the interview I found out Python has a thing called <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/25753528?ref=ashu1461.com" rel="noreferrer">chained expressions</a> when you write something like the above, it gets transformed to the later statement given below :</p><pre><code>if (cell[0][0] == cell[1][1] == cell[2][2]) {
    return Winner
}

if ((cell[0][0] == cell[1][1]) and (cell[1][1] == cell[2][2])) {
    return Winner
}
</code></pre><p>Well the code is indeed correct ðŸ¤·. Well done, Pythonâ€¦ for finding yet another way to confuse us all.</p>
