    <h1>America’s favorite family outings are increasingly out of reach</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>Earlier this summer, <strong>Steven Martinez</strong> made a promise to his two young kids: He’d finally take them to Disneyland, the “happiest place on Earth.”</p>



<p>But Martinez, a customer service specialist in Los Angeles, didn’t feel the magic when he saw the price tag.</p>



<p>“Just for one day in the park and one night at the hotel, we were looking at over $1k and that didn’t even include food,” he says. “I had to explain to the kids that Mickey was out of Daddy’s budget.”</p>



<p>Most families across the country can relate.</p>



<p>In the 1950s and ’60s — the so-called <a href="https://econreview.berkeley.edu/back-when-america-was-socialist/">Golden Age</a> of American capitalism — family outings were within the realm of affordability for most median income earners. Many blue-collar workers could afford new homes and cars and still take their kids to Disneyland.</p>



<p>Despite rising wages, many of those same activities are now out of reach for everyday Americans.</p>



<p><em>The Hustle</em> analyzed the cost of three family activities in 1960 vs. 2022:</p>



<ol><li>A baseball game</li><li>A movie at a theater</li><li>A one-day Disneyland visit</li></ol>



<p>We found that these family outings have increased in cost at <strong>2-3x</strong> the rate of inflation — and that, in order to afford them, today’s American families have to work up to <strong>2x as many hours</strong> as they did 60 years ago.</p>



<h4 id="h-wages-1960-vs-today"><strong>Wages: 1960 vs. today</strong></h4>



<p>Before we get into the numbers, let’s compare how much families earned in 1960 to what they earn today.</p>



<p>For this analysis, we used <strong>median family income </strong>data from the US Census Bureau, which skews higher than median <em>household</em> income. This measures the typical sum of all earnings of family members who live together.</p>

<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>In 1960, the median family <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1962/demo/p60-037.html#:~:text=For%20the%20country%20as%20a,the%20Census%2C%20Department%20of%20Commerce.">brought in</a> <strong>$5,620 </strong>($2.70/hr), or <strong>~$55.5k</strong> per year adjusted for inflation. Today’s median family earns considerably more, at <strong>$84k</strong> per year, or $40.38/hr.</p>



<p>But when it comes to traditional family outings, the purchasing power of that income has declined.</p>



<p>For each of these examples, we’ll calculate the cost for a <strong>family of four</strong> (two parents and two kids).</p>



<h4 id="h-baseball-games"><strong>Baseball games</strong></h4>



<p>First, let’s take a look at “America’s favorite pastime,” a Major League Baseball game.</p>



<p>We began with 2022 data from the <a href="https://teammarketing.com/fancostindex/">FanCostIndex</a>, which compiles the average price of tickets, food, beverages, and parking across all 30 MLB teams. Then, we calculated the total cost of the items a family of four  typically buys at the ballpark:</p>



<ul><li>Four Tickets</li><li>Two Beers</li><li>Two Sodas</li><li>Four Hot dogs</li><li>Parking</li></ul>



<p>At today’s ballgames, the total of these items varies regionally, from a whopping <strong>$324</strong> (Boston Red Sox) down to <strong>$126</strong> (Arizona Diamondbacks). </p>



<p>But across all teams, the average works out to <strong>$204.76 </strong>per family.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="1621" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/familyoutings-costbyteam2.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/familyoutings-costbyteam2-222x300.png 222w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/familyoutings-costbyteam2-758x1024.png 758w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/familyoutings-costbyteam2-768x1037.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/familyoutings-costbyteam2-1137x1536.png 1137w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/familyoutings-costbyteam2-37x50.png 37w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/familyoutings-costbyteam2.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>

<p>How’s that stack up to a baseball game in 1960?</p>



<p>We trawled through newspaper archives and baseball history books to piece together per-unit cost estimates for the same items.</p>



<p>The chart below shows the actual price per unit in 1960, that same price adjusted for inflation in 2022 dollars, the price in 2022, and the total cumulative cost for a family to attend a ballgame in each case.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="1212" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/baseball60v3.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/baseball60v3-297x300.png 297w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/baseball60v3-1014x1024.png 1014w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/baseball60v3-768x776.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/baseball60v3-50x50.png 50w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/baseball60v3-24x24.png 24w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/baseball60v3-48x48.png 48w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/baseball60v3-96x96.png 96w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/baseball60v3.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>Back in the day, four tickets cost a mere <strong>$1.91</strong> ($18.86 in 2022 dollars), two beers and four hot dogs could be had for <strong>$0.35</strong> ($3.46), and parking was the bargain of the century at <strong>$0.25</strong> ($2.47).</p>



<p>For a family of four in 1960, the average total would’ve come out to ~<strong>$10.35</strong>. Adjusted for inflation, that’s <strong>~$102</strong> — or half of what it costs today.</p>



<p>Where’s all that extra cost coming from?</p>



<p>Since 1960, the cumulative rate of inflation across <em>all</em> goods in the US has been <strong>888%</strong> (meaning $1 in 1960 is $9.88 today). By contrast, baseball tickets, ballgame beer, and hot dogs have gone up more than <strong>1,000%</strong>.</p>



<p>But where fans are really getting taken for a ride is in the parking lot.</p>



<p>At $16.79, the average cost to park a vehicle at a baseball game today is <strong>6,616%</strong> more than it was in 1960 — 7.5x the rate of inflation!</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="1098" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bballgame-peritem.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bballgame-peritem-300x275.png 300w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bballgame-peritem-1024x937.png 1024w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bballgame-peritem-768x703.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bballgame-peritem-50x46.png 50w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bballgame-peritem.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>This is partly a reflection of the increasing cost of land. But it’s also a result of simple supply and demand: At many stadiums, parking is a limited resource, and drivers are willing to shell out more than what is reasonable for a slice of asphalt. </p>



<p>Some teams are more inclined to gouge their fans than others.</p>



<p>The Texas Rangers, who have one of the most expensive parking lots in the MLB, hike up parking fees as a way to <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/investigates/experts-new-arlington-stadium-deal-among-the-worst-in-the-country/251473853">pass</a> new stadium construction costs on to their fans. Call it a nice little fan appreciation gesture.</p>



<p>But the practice of overcharging for ancillary offerings isn’t unique to baseball teams.</p>



<h4 id="h-the-movies"><strong>The movies</strong></h4>



<p>Taking the family to see a movie was once heralded as a cheap, fun way to spend an afternoon. Has that reputation held up over time?</p>



<p>Let’s assume a family of four goes to view an esteemed motion picture like <em>Minions: The Rise of Gru</em> at the local theater and buys the following:</p>



<ul><li>Four Tickets</li><li>Four Sodas</li><li>Two Popcorns</li><li>One Box of Candy</li></ul>



<p>For 2022 prices, we compiled average movie ticket data from <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/market/">The Numbers</a> and average concessions data from <a href="https://www.moviefoodprices.com/amc-concession-prices/">Movie Food Prices</a>’ AMC theaters list. For 1960 prices, we turned to newspaper archives from 10 cities across the US and created an aggregate estimate.</p>



<p>All in all, today’s family movie outing averages <strong>$68.73</strong>.</p>



<p>Back in 1960? About <strong>$3.76</strong> ($34.15, adjusted for inflation).</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="1088" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/movies60v22.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/movies60v22-300x272.png 300w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/movies60v22-1024x928.png 1024w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/movies60v22-768x696.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/movies60v22-50x45.png 50w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/movies60v22.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>As is the case with baseball games, the cost of seeing a movie with the kids today is <strong>2x</strong> the inflation-adjusted 1960 cost.</p>



<p>Also similar to ballgames, the ticket price itself is the least egregiously priced item on the list.</p>



<p>Adjusted for inflation, that $0.70 movie ticket in 1960 would be about $6.17 today — not <em>too</em> far off from the modern-day average of $9.17. As <em>The Hustle</em> has <a href="https://thehustle.co/why-is-movie-theater-popcorn-so-outrageously-expensive/">previously explained</a>, it’s the concessions stand where the theaters really get you.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1024" height="825" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/movies-peritem-1.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/movies-peritem-1-300x242.png 300w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/movies-peritem-1-1024x825.png 1024w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/movies-peritem-1-768x619.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/movies-peritem-1-50x40.png 50w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/movies-peritem-1.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>In 1960, movie treats were pretty modestly priced.</p>



<p>A popcorn or candy bar would set you back <strong>~$0.20</strong> ($1.97, adjusted for inflation), and soda ran a few cents cheaper.</p>



<p>Today, that wouldn’t even get you an extra pump of processed butter: Candy (+1,210%), soda (+2,145%), and popcorn (+3,845%) have all outpaced inflation by <strong>3-4x</strong>.</p>



<p>The reasons for this have a lot to do with the ailing business model of movie theaters.</p>



<p>Theaters have to fork over ~70% of all ticket sales to the distributor, leaving them with little to cover expenses. They tend to think of movies as a loss leader, and make their profits on food and drinks.</p>



<p>The markup on a tub of popcorn, which costs less than $1 to make, is ~800%. At major chains like AMC and Cinemark, concessions only account for ~30% of total gross revenue, yet make up 45%-50% of gross profits.</p>



<h4 id="h-disneyland"><strong>Disneyland</strong></h4>



<p>Lastly, we wanted to take a look at the big daddy of all family outings: a trip to Disneyland in Anaheim, California.</p>



<p>We chose to keep this one simple and omit the cost of travel/airfare. We also didn’t include food, since the park permits guests to bring in their own snacks.</p>



<p>What we’ve laid out is a<strong> bare-bones </strong>Disneyland outing for a family of four, comprised of the following costs:</p>



<ul><li>Two child tickets (one-day)</li><li>Two adult tickets (one-day)</li><li>Parking</li><li>A one-night stay at Disneyland Hotel</li></ul>



<p>The 2022 prices come from Disney’s own websites, assuming a weekend day trip in June (Disney has dynamic ticket pricing). The 1960 prices were gleaned from old ticket stubs and newspaper archives.</p>



<p>(One important clarifying note: Back in 1960, you paid for the park admission ticket and the rides separately. We’ve combined those costs below.)</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="1136" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/disney-FINAL.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/disney-FINAL-300x284.png 300w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/disney-FINAL-1024x969.png 1024w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/disney-FINAL-768x727.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/disney-FINAL-50x47.png 50w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/disney-FINAL-24x24.png 24w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/disney-FINAL.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>In 1960, an adult ticket was $1.60, and a child’s ticket (ages 3-11) was just $0.60. A 10-ride pass was an additional $3.95 (adult) and $2.95 (child). Those combined costs would be <strong>$54.81</strong> for an adult and <strong>$35.06 </strong>for a child, adjusted for inflation.</p>



<p>Today’s prices today are far steeper: Tickets clock in at <strong>$149</strong> and <strong>$141</strong>, respectively.</p>



<p>Once $18/night ($178 in today’s money), a double-bed room at Disneyland Hotel will now set you back<strong> $445</strong>.</p>



<p>But like the ballgame, the real kick in the ass is the parking.</p>



<p>It used to be a mere <strong>$0.25</strong> ($2.47, adjusted) to park your car there. Today, it’s <strong>$30</strong>. That’s — wait for it — an 11,900% bump in price since 1960, or <strong>13.5x</strong> the rate of inflation.</p>



<p>Disney’s main parking lot, affectionately dubbed Mickey and Friends, cost $108m and was <a href="https://voiceofoc.org/2021/07/are-anaheim-taxpayers-subsidizing-disneyland-class-action-lawsuit-may-find-out/">subsidized</a> through government bonds. Disney leases the land from the city of Anaheim for a whopping $1/year and keeps all profits from the garage.</p>

<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>“If Walt [Disney] were alive today, he would probably be uncomfortable with the prices they’re charging right now,” <strong>Scott Smith</strong>, an assistant professor of hospitality at the University of South Carolina, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2015/06/12/how-theme-parks-like-disney-world-left-the-middle-class-behind/">told</a> the <em>Washington Post</em> in 2015. “They’ve priced middle-class families out.”</p>



<p>Of course, one could argue that a Disney goer is getting a better value than they would’ve 60 years ago. In 1960, the park had &lt;20 attractions (rides, shows, exhibits); today, it has 53.</p>



<p>Disneyland’s operating costs have also significantly increased over the years: ride maintenance, <a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2021/09/disney-parks-main-street-usa-hitching-posts-painted-every-day-rwb1/">daily painting</a>, landscaping, engineering, merchandising, parade float operations — you get the drift. The park’s annual attendance has increased threefold, to 18m, since 1960.</p>



<p>Still, for a park that has received <strong>~$500m in government handouts </strong>since 1991, one would expect a little more generosity when it comes to price sensitivity for guests.</p>



<h4 id="h-how-many-hours-do-families-have-to-work-to-afford-outings"><strong>How many hours do families have to work to afford outings?</strong></h4>



<p>Assuming 40-hour weeks and a standard 2,080 work hours per year, the median family wage in 1960 ($5,620) worked out to ~<strong>$2.70/hour</strong>. Today’s median ($84k) is <strong>$40.38/hr</strong>.</p>



<p>How many more hours do families have to work today to afford these activities?</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="1088" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hours-of-work.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hours-of-work-300x272.png 300w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hours-of-work-1024x928.png 1024w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hours-of-work-768x696.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hours-of-work-50x45.png 50w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hours-of-work.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>Though wages have gone up considerably since 1960, they’ve been outpaced by the growing cost of family activities.</p>



<p>These increases may look small (partly because they’re dwarfed by Disneyland’s figures), but spending 22%-96% more time at the office is pretty consequential when you have a family to take care of.</p>



<p>For those earning minimum wage, this struggle is especially pronounced.</p>



<p>In 1960, the federal minimum wage was $1/hr — higher, adjusted for inflation ($9.88/hr), than today’s $7.25.</p>



<p>Decades ago, some of these family outings were within grasp. But today, a family with two minimum wage earners would have to work <strong>173%-299% more hours </strong>to take their family out than two similar workers in 1960. For them, a one-day trip to Disneyland would require nearly two weeks of pay.</p>

<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>Recent research has shown that a family <a href="https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/reports/2022-county-health-rankings-national-findings-report">has to earn</a> at least <strong>$35.80/hour</strong> just to meet basic needs. The average two-kid family spends <strong>25%</strong> of its income on child care alone — and these figures don’t even fully take into account runaway inflation, which recently topped 9%.</p>
