	<ul>
		<li>The world is randomly generated with distinct civilizations spanning centuries of detailed history, hundreds of towns, caves and regions with various wildlife.</li>
		<li>The world persists as long as you like, over many games, recording historical events and tracking changes.</li>
		<li>Command your dwarves as they search for wealth in the mountain.
		<ul>
			<li>Craft treasures and furniture from many materials and improve these objects with precious metals, jewels and more.</li>

			<li>Lay out taverns, libraries, guildhalls and temples to enrich dwarven life and meet their needs.  Build a shrine to a volcano deity in a volcano.  Serve mushroom wine in the finest goblets.  What discoveries will your dwarves make?</li>
			<li>Accept non-dwarven residents from all over the world as your reputation grows.</li>
			<li>Surgery, sutures, splints, crutches and more:  care for your wounded dwarves instead of leaving them to fend for themselves.</li>
