<ol>
<li>Full access to JavaScript. Be one with the host.</li>
<li>No runtime. Participate in the library ecosystem.</li>
<li>Perfect is the enemy of good. Versions are infinite.</li>
<li>Be useful today. Survive to thrive.</li>
<li>Be fast. Stay fast.</li>
</ol>
<p>JavaScript is ubiquitous. It&#39;s ecosystem is diverse and populated. Dak attempts
to provide a path to leverage and participate in this ecosystem, as a modern
lisp like language. It is not a Lisp. It&#39;s still JavaScript, but wearing a Lisp
outfit. It&#39;s not Common Lisp or Scheme, but a bit more like Clojure or Fennel.
It doesn&#39;t hide it&#39;s true nature, and aims to provide access to every feature
JavaScript has.</p>
<h2 id="browser">Browser</h2>
<p>Browser output is an important goal. Specifically, small bundle size and tree
shaking for pay-as-you-go, are key considerations that determine the design
choices. If you are making a browser based application in Dak, a
<a href="https://github.com/daaku/dak/blob/main/packages/rollup">Vite based setup is the recommended choice</a>. ES Modules
support is virtually required and baked in.</p>
<h2 id="cli">CLI</h2>
<p>CLI tooling using <code>node</code> can be built using the <a href="https://github.com/daaku/dak/blob/main/packages/loader">ESM Loader</a>.
It provides a loader but otherwise doesn&#39;t get in your way. Maybe look at
<a href="https://github.com/daaku/dak/blob/main/make.dak"><code>make.dak</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/daaku/dak/blob/main/packages/website/build.dak"><code>build.dak</code></a> for
inspiration. For one off use <a href="https://github.com/daaku/dak/blob/main/packages/cli"><code>npx @daklang/cli</code></a> can do in a
pinch, though <code>npx</code> adds considerable overhead.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p>A language needs an ecosystem. Formatting, LSP, <a href="https://github.com/daaku/dak/blob/main/packages/vscode">VSCode</a>
extensions, REPL, unit testing, benchmarking and so much more. We don&#39;t have
much here.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.daklang.com/tour/macros/">Macros</a> and the programmable aspects of
Dak are what I consider to be it&#39;s selling points. It&#39;s much easier to achieve
this in a Lisp like language. These are still very much a work-in-progress.
Expect heavy iteration here.</p>
<p>Syntax in JavaScript is quite diverse. Much of it is already supported. What is
missing is probably easy to provide.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&#39;s Next?</h2>
<p>It&#39;s all a bit fuzzy, but a seemingly good near term goal is to provide a fun,
featureful and fast development experience to build browser based UX
applications that can use hiccup like syntax and leverage React, lit-html or
Solid.</p>
