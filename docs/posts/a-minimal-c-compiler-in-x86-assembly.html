Historically, June relied on Segment to support this function. </p><p>Today, we’re excited to announce that June customers can use Freshpaint to get data into June up to 14x faster.</p><p>At Freshpaint, we’re excited to offer a no-code alternative for powering tools like June. Freshpaint’s visual editor means anyone on the team can create and configure new events to share with June. </p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5dad2b1e508f04886d0245c3/626aa9802d23836cdf31f472_Clutch%20autotrack%20shop.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Freshpaint&#39;s visual editor empowers non-technical users to capture user actions on your site</figcaption></figure><p>Freshpaint also works retroactively, so you can explore behaviors and create events that measure them even after your launches occur. When you create a new event in Freshpaint you’ll be able to backfill and send the historical data to June to get new insights right away. </p><p>Because Freshpaint makes it easier for you to get data into June, you’ll get everything you need to start growing your business without having to choose between using technical resources to build your product or help analyze your product. </p><ul role="list"><li>Instead of requiring your engineering team to code every customer event, Freshpaint uses Javascript to detect customer clicks and actions on your site automatically.</li><li>Product and marketing teams can name and configure events using a visual editor, then send the data to June and other tools in your tech stack.</li><li>Ever get a great piece of customer insight only to spark a new question you can’t answer right away because you didn’t think to track it? Freshpaint gives you answers today by backfilling historical data from any new event and sending it to June.</li><li>For healthcare companies Freshpaint is HIPAA compliant thanks to a signed BAA and purpose-built features that help manage the flow of PHI to third party tools. </li></ul><h2><strong>Why We Love the June Integration with Freshpaint</strong></h2><p>Product teams need better data faster to keep up with their outrageous (I mean that in a good way) growth goals. But the way we capture and feed data to analytics tools is too slow and resource intensive.</p><p>We feel like the team at June are kindred spirits. We both recognize that up until now the way we implement customer data has been designed for engineers. That’s because instrumenting all our tools using SDKs &amp; APIs takes weeks if not months to get it right. You have to either manually configure each tool in your tech stack, or if you’re using a traditional customer data platform, engineering has to manually code every event on your site.</p><p>Freshpaint is a no-code solution for getting event data into tools like June in a day instead of weeks. And because June automatically creates the reports you need to create smart dashboards, you’re customer data implementation and iteration can finally keep up with your speed of growth. </p><ul role="list"><li>Go from no analytics to meaningful product analytics in less than a day</li><li>Keep your engineers and data scientists focused on building great products, not collecting data. </li><li>Get the insights you to make </li></ul><h2><strong>Documentation &amp; Implementation </strong></h2><p>Ready to get started?</p><p>Getting started is easy.
