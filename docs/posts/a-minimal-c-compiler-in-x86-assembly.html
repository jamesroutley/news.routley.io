    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>OneSignal is a customer engagement solution for push notifications, email, SMS &amp; in-app notification. Install OneSignal on your website or app and you can reap the benefits of better customer messaging and engagement throughout your customer’s entire journey. </p><p>We’re excited to partner with the OneSignal team to help you get the data you need to power even better messaging faster. With Freshpaint, instead of waiting weeks for engineers to manually set up event tracking, you can autotrack customer actions on your site and send customer data to OneSignal in days. Better customer data faster means even more targeted messaging.</p><h2><strong>Engage and Convert More Customers with OneSignal</strong></h2><p>OneSignal is an all-in-one customer messaging platform that allows you to send push notifications, in-app messages, SMS, and emails.</p><p>Engage and convert customers with OneSignal’s features:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Mobile Push: </strong>Delight customers with messaging on their phones.</li><li><strong>Web Push:</strong> Send web pushes to your customer, even after they leave your site.</li><li><strong>Email:</strong> Create beautiful, professional emails that convert and look great.</li><li><strong>SMS: </strong>Reach customers on their phone for higher engagement. </li><li><strong>In-App Messages:</strong> Create interstitials, carousels, and banners to convert customers.</li></ul><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5dad2b1e508f04886d0245c3/626afcce73f41564184a0a2c_project-ronin-choosing-onesignal%20(1).jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Create more timely and relevant messaging using OneSignal</figcaption></figure><h2>‍<strong>The OneSignal Integration with Freshpaint</strong></h2><p>OneSignal currently uses a REST API that allows your engineering team to send event data from your site to OneSignal. Another way to say this: any time someone clicks on your site, you can send that information to OneSignal to trigger communication like a text, email, or push notification. </p><p>However, getting valuable data to OneSignal can be an engineering intensive exercise that often faces delays due to prioritization and engineering sprint timing. That’s where Freshpaint comes in. </p><p>Freshpaint autotracks actions on your site and sends the customer data to your marketing and analytics tools using prebuilt integrations. The result: product and marketing teams can get the data they need to OneSignal without waiting for engineering sprint cycles.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5dad2b1e508f04886d0245c3/626afd14f25ea2b4442c13b7_Clutch%20autotrack%20video%20click.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Track video views with Freshpaint&#39;s visual editor then send data to OneSignal for messaging that drives conversions</figcaption></figure><p>Because Freshpaint makes it easier for you to get data into OneSignal, you can craft smarter and more relevant messages. It’s all about the right message and the right time. </p><ul role="list"><li>Instead of requiring your engineering team to code every customer event, Freshpaint uses Javascript to detect customer clicks and actions on your site automatically. Product and marketing teams can name and configure events using a visual editor, then send them to analytics tools like Mixpanel and advertising tools like Facebook using prebuilt integrations.</li><li>Ever get a great piece of customer insight only to spark a new question you can’t answer right away because you didn’t think to track it? Freshpaint gives you answers today instead of two weeks from now by backfilling the historical data from any new event and sending it to the tools in your tech stack.</li><li>For healthcare companies Freshpaint is HIPAA Compliant and gives you a purpose built toolset to help you manage PHI. </li></ul><h2><strong>Why We Love the OneSignal Integration with Freshpaint</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve got Freshpaint and OneSignal up-and-running, it’s time to turn your customer data into razor sharp messaging.</p><ul role="list"><li>Map out customized workflows at every touchpoint, pass those touchpoints from your site to OneSignal with Fresnhpaint, and send relevant messaging based on user attributes or behavior to drive activation, engagement, and ultimately LTV. </li><li>Separate free signups from paying customers and send tailored messages to get each group toward your business goals. </li><li>Collect information about your customer industry and tailor messaging to their personas for better conversion rates. </li></ul><h2>‍<strong>Documentation &amp; Implementation </strong></h2><p>Ready to get started?</p><p>You can trial OneSignal for free and upgrade your plan based on usage and desired features. </p><p>Getting started is easy.
