    <h2>A new tool to empower everyone on the web with privacy-respecting online identity and consent-based data sharing</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p id="below">Read <a href="#testimonials">testimonials from W3C Members and the industry</a></p> 
    
    <hr/>
    <p id="desc"><a href="https://www.w3.org/">https://www.w3.org/</a> — 19 July 2022 — The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has announced that Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 is now an official Web standard. This new type of verifiable identifier, which does not require a centralized registry, will enable both individuals and organizations to take greater control of their online information and relationships while also providing greater security and privacy.</p>
    <p>There is a historical analog to this announcement in the evolution of mobile phone numbers. Originally these were owned by the mobile carrier and &#34;rented&#34; to the individual. This required individuals to change numbers if they changed carriers. With the adoption of mobile phone number portability, individuals could now &#34;take their numbers with them&#34; when switching carriers.</p>
    <p>The same is true of most email addresses and social network addresses today—they are not “owned” by individuals and must be changed if the individual changes providers. By contrast, W3C Decentralized Identifiers can be controlled by the individuals or organizations that create them, are portable between service providers, and can last for as long as their controller wants to continue using them.</p>
    <p>Whatsmore, DIDs have the unique property of enabling the controller to verify ownership of the DID using cryptography. This can enable any controller of a DID—an individual, an organization, an online community, a government, an IoT device—to engage in more trustworthy transactions online. For individuals in particular, DIDs can put them back in control of their personal data and consent, and also enable more respectful bi-directional trust relationships where forgery is prevented, privacy is honored, and usability is enhanced.</p>
    <p>Fundamentally, Decentralized Identifiers are a new type of globally unambiguous identifier that can be used to identify any subject (e.g., a person, an organization, a device, a product, a location, even an abstract entity or a concept). Each DID resolves to a DID document that contains the cryptographic material and other metadata for controlling the DID. The foundational pillars of the DID specification are: 1) DIDs do not require a central issuing agency (decentralized), 2) DIDs do not require the continued operation of an underlying organization (persistent), 3) Control of DIDs, and the information they are associated with, can be proven cryptographically (verifiable), and 4) DID metadata can be discovered (resolvable).</p>
    <h3>Markets adopting DIDs</h3>
    <p>W3C Decentralized Identifiers, coupled with W3C Verifiable Credentials, are being used across a number of markets where identification and data authenticity is a concern:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Governments – The US, Canada, and the EU, are exploring the use of DIDs to provide privacy-protecting digital identity documentation for their businesses and residents, which enable those entities to choose how and when their data is shared.</li>
      <li>Retailers – convenience stores, grocery stores, restaurants, bars, and consumer goods companies in the US are utilizing DIDs for new digital age verification programs to increase privacy, checkout speed, and combat the use of fraudulent identity documents when purchasing age-gated products.</li>
      <li>Supply chain stakeholders — global government regulators, trade standards institutions, vendors, shippers, and retailers—are using DIDs to explore next generation systems that more accurately verify the origin and destination of products and services, which will streamline and enable the reporting designed to apply correct tariffs, prevent dumping, and monitor transshipment.</li>
      <li>Workforce – universities, job training programs, and education standards organizations are adopting DIDs in order to issue digital learning credentials that are controlled and shared by the graduate when applying for higher education or workforce positions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The Work Continues at W3C</h3>
    <p>W3C, composed of over 450 organizations, has made the investment in W3C Decentralized Identifiers and W3C Verifiable Credentials to ensure a more decentralized, privacy-respecting, and consent-based data sharing ecosystem. Official standards work will continue on these technologies through the newly re-chartered W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0 Working Group, which will focus on expanding functionality based on market feedback. Further incubation on future privacy-respecting technologies will occur through the W3C Credentials Community Group, which is open to participation by the general public.</p>

      <p id="igrantio">&#34;<span lang="en-gb">Decentralised Identifiers open a new world for individuals to share personal data (credentials) while protecting their privacy. One fundamental aspect of any data exchange is auditability and regulatory compliance. Through our work with NGI-Trust eSSIF-Lab, MyData and similar organisations, iGrant.io has contributed to defining and standardising data exchange agreements (did:mydata) that make every personal data transaction immutable, trustworthy and auditable. This will create new opportunities with seamless data sharing across public and private entities governed by new data regulations.</span>&#34;</p>

    <h3>I/O by Ayo</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p id="iobyayo">&#34;When I first read the W3C Decentralized Identifier specification, my response was twofold: 1. amazement at the robust, yet tractable, approach that it brings to bear on the problem of self-controlled identity 2. excitement for the universe of opportunity that lay ahead for individuals and organizations to reclaim control over their identity. In our work with organizations like the Digital Credentials Consortium and Gobekli Inc., we are using DIDs to help users prove control over academic and professional credentials that they have accumulated from different contexts. This novel specification goes a long way toward our mission of enabling agency through technology.&#34;</p>

    <h3>The National Association of Convenience Stores</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p id="nacs">&#34;In the Convenience Retail channel, age restricted items represent roughly 50 million transactions a day!  Restricted items traditionally have been limited within a single transaction, with the age checked using a driver’s license.  Regulatory scrutiny now extends to industry-wide sales of items to individuals no matter where they purchase them, and verifying age for the sale of those items using a driver&#39;s license presents a big privacy threat.  Addressing this issue, NACS has created the TruAge program using W3C Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials. Working with our partner Conexxus, NACS has been able to provide a system using open standards that gives a clear “on ramp” for additional participants in the ecosystem.  TruAge supports both in-store and on-line transactions, providing safe and responsible sales of age restricted goods while preserving consumer privacy.</p>

      <p id="pprf">&#34;Standardized DIDs are an essential first step toward empowering individuals to engage peers, institutions and service providers without having to trade platform surveillance for convenience. A standardized digital identifier empowers the individual by reducing their switching costs among service providers and platform intermediaries. The power of individual choice and self-determination will not be realized, however, unless the protocols that incorporate identity enable delegation in order to manage the burden of choice and the anxiety of self-determination.&#34;</p>
