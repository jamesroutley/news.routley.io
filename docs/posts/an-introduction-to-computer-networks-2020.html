              <p>Welcome to the website for <em>An Introduction to Computer
                  Networks</em>, a free and open general-purpose
                computer-networking textbook, complete with diagrams and
                exercises. It covers the LAN, internetworking and transport
                layers, focusing primarily on TCP/IP. Particular attention is
                paid to congestion; other special topics include queuing,
                real-time traffic, network management, security, mininet and the
                ns simulator. </p>
              <p> The book is suitable as the primary text for an undergraduate
                or introductory graduate course in computer networking, as a
                supplemental text for a wide variety of network-related courses,
                and as a reference work. </p>

              <p>As of the end of July 2020 I am pleased to introduce the <strong>second
                  edition</strong>. The first version of the second edition,
                2.0.1, is essentially identical to the final release of the
                first edition, 1.9.21, except that the chapters have been
                divided into more manageable size; see the discussion in the
                preface for more. Here are the versions for the second edition:</p>

              I have started a directory of <b><a href="https://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/contributions">
                  supplemental and contributed material</a></b>, such as
              powerpoints, slides and labs. Submissions are welcome!
              </p>
              <p>A <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1P32pBBd65ZY1U4AJ7gMbHiJgztZW3nL49HR-mSCt5dc/viewform?usp=send_form">comment
                  form</a> is now available. Let me know what you think!</p>
              <p>In the html versions the per-chapter table-of-contents sidebar
                is now collapsible, for better use of screen space on smaller
                devices. Unfortunately, this has broken the search feature.
                Repairs are underway, but progress has been slow.</p>
              <p>See the <a href="https://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/current1/html/preface.html#technical-considerations">preface</a>
                for more information on the unicode issues that have led to the
                unicode-safer versions above. </p>
              <p>Edition 1.0 of the book is permanently available as <a href="https://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/1/html">Online html</a>, <a href="https://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/1/ComputerNetworks.zip">Zipped html</a>, <a href="https://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/1/ComputerNetworks.pdf">pdf</a> and <a href="https://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/1/ComputerNetworks.epub">epub</a>
                although most users are more likely to want the current version
                above.</p>
