    <h1>Stopping thing-a-month</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, May 6, 2024</em></p><p>I&#39;m going to have to stop doing thing-a-month. I really love it as an idea, but it&#39;s not working out so well for me:</p><ul><li>it turns out I&#39;m pretty good at planning projects like this, but when I have such limited free time it&#39;s way too easy to overcommit.</li><li>trying to figure out how to build a business around a tiny idea in a month is a bit much.</li><li>doing that <em>and writing about it</em> is even more work.</li></ul><p>Taken together, it basically means I&#39;m overcommitting, then having to be accountable for it in public. Not a great combination for me mentally; I&#39;m avoiding building things that I want and that I think sound fun to make!</p><p>So something&#39;s gotta change.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p>Instead, I think I&#39;m going to drop the thing-a-month commitment and instead commit to writing weekly updates here. I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s better for me to be able to commit to steady progress than big epic effort. (That&#39;s probably true of a lot of people, but I think we&#39;re conditioned by storytelling to think that the epic efforts are the better choice.)</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been working on:</p><ul><li>I really love the idea of tinyping and I&#39;d like it to exist in some form in the world.<ul><li>As a reminder, there are a few apps that do this already (see a list at <a href="https://doc.beeminder.com/tagtime">Beeminder&#39;s page about this</a>) but none of them sync the data anywhere, making it harder to get pings during the time when you&#39;re doing what you&#39;re doing. In the interests of making the data entry easier, I&#39;m trying to solve this problem by using <a href="https://automerge.org/">automerge</a> as the storage layer (which also makes it local-first software!)</li></ul></li><li>Because of some trouble I had keeping types straight between Elm and TypeScript (as well as similar pains I had at work) I started making something I&#39;m calling elm-duet. It accepts an interop schema using <a href="https://jsontypedef.com/">JSON Type Definitions</a> and generates both the Elm and TypeScript code. I spent most of April working on this, and it&#39;s almost ready for release. It has some ergonomic issues in the generated code, but it&#39;s definitely a step up already.</li></ul><p>The plan going into this week is to (re)write the README for elm-duet and get that released. It&#39;s not the most polished piece of software yet, but I think it&#39;s worth getting out there as an idea. We&#39;ll see where we end up next Monday!</p></article></div>
