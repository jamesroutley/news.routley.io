    <h1>IKEA launches new smart home range with 21 Matter-compatible products</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-zgyzv6ok=""><!--[--><div containerclass="" data-astro-cid-zgyzv6ok="true"><div><!----><p><span>IKEA is launching 21 new smart home products focusing on lighting, sensors, and control — all built to work with Matter, the universal smart home standard. The launch marks a significant step in making smart home technology easier to use, more affordable, and better adapted to real-life needs in the home. </span></p><p><span>With this launch, IKEA is rebuilding its smart home system and product range from the ground up. The new launch reflects years of development and testing in real homes, and a growing understanding of how people want smart products to work in their daily life. </span></p><p><span>The launch includes both new products and updates to existing categories – now built to work with Matter. This means IKEA smart products can connect with a wider range of devices and platforms, making it easier for customers to build a smart home across different brands. </span></p><p><span>“Until now, smart home technology hasn’t been easy enough to use for most people — or affordable enough for many to consider. This launch brings us closer to helping everyone feel ready and confident to get started,” says David Granath, Range Manager at IKEA of Sweden. </span></p><p><span>The updated range focuses on three key segments*, that provide the building blocks of a smart home that’s flexible, intuitive, and easy to expand over time.  </span></p><ul><li><span><strong>Lighting</strong> – The new smart bulb range from IKEA. Comes in a variety of shapes, sizes, lumen levels and styles, including colour and white spectrum options, and dimmable features. </span></li><li><span><strong>Sensors</strong> – motion, air quality, humidity and water leakage sensors designed to support wellbeing and prevent damage </span></li><li><span><strong>Control </strong>– Remotes that make it easy to control devices from a distance, and a smart plug that can turn any product into a smart product. </span></li></ul><p><em><span>*</span></em><span>Full product list further down.   </span></p><p><span>“This launch is about making the smart home experience better and broader. We&#39;re upgrading our most-appreciated products while also adding new ones to solve even more everyday challenges. Our focus has been on keeping things simple from setup to daily use, so it’s easy for people to start, use and grow a smart home,” says Stjepan Begic, Product Developer at IKEA of Sweden. </span></p><p><span>All Matter-enabled products need a smart home hub to work — like IKEA’s DIRIGERA hub, or one from another brand. As a </span><a data-track-category="Text link" href="https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/sustainability/ikea-announces-new-chapter-in-designing-technology-for-the-home-250709/"><span>certified Matter controller</span></a><span>, DIRIGERA can also manage and control smart products from other manufacturers and brands. As a </span><a data-track-category="Text link" href="https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/innovation/ikea-dirigera-matter-bridge-240911/"><span>Matter Bridge</span></a><span>, it ensures that existing IKEA non-Matter smart products will also be compatible with platforms using the Matter standard. </span></p><p><span>This launch is the first step in a broader update of the IKEA Home smart range. Looking ahead, IKEA will continue expanding into new product categories. The strategy is to launch products that are easier to use and more affordable than existing ones.  </span></p><p><span>“Our goal is still the same as when we started exploring the smart home in 2012: to make it easy to use, easy to understand, and within reach for the many. We start with understanding life at home, where we continuously watch, listen and learn what makes a difference in everyday life. We believe technology should serve a purpose, not exist for its own sake. With more than 900 million store visits each year, I think we’re in a good place to help more people discover the benefits of a smarter home,” says David Granath. </span></p><p><span>Sales start and local pricing may vary between markets. Please contact your local IKEA market for more information. </span></p><h2><span><strong>Discover the new Matter-compatible IKEA Home smart range:</strong> </span></h2><p><span><strong>The KAJPLATS smart bulb range</strong> includes <strong>eleven variations</strong>, offering a mix of shapes, sizes, lumen levels, and styles — with options for both colour and white spectrum, as well as dimmable functionality.
