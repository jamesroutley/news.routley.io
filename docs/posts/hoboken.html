For those of you reading from outside the area, Hoboken is a small city in New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from New York. It’s about 5 km2 in size (small!) but has a population of 60,000 people. That places it as the fourth most dense city in the United States<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Hoboken is at best ignored and at worst scoffed at by New Yorkers. It’s on the other side of the Hudson. In New Jersey. You have to transfer to a different train system to get there. We assume it’s a people that worship different gods.</p>

<p>I haven’t spent much time in Hoboken aside from a high school engineering program at Stevens University and a couple of day trips. I decided to do a walk there the other day to take some photos and take in the urban landscape. Each time I end up there I get the sense that it’s a criminally underrated city, at least in terms of its urban design.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to many of my fellow New Yorkers, Hoboken has been quietly upgrading their street infrastructure to increase cycling and pedestrian safety. They haven’t had a traffic-related death since 2018.</p>

<p>This is practically unheard of in the United States. At least among cities of Hoboken’s population. If you read the city’s <a href="https://www.hobokennj.gov/news/city-of-hoboken-reaches-new-vision-zero-milestone-seven-consecutive-years-without-a-traffic-death">press release</a> about it, you’ll learn their secret: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_daylighting">daylighting intersections</a>, reducing speed limits, improving crosswalk visibility. These aren’t innovative or new techniques; we’ve known about their existence and effectiveness for a long time. Hoboken’s secret sauce is their ability to actually implement these boring-but-effective pieces of public policy.</p>

<p>As I was walking around I stumbled on a few blocks of a residential street that had been closed off to traffic. When I asked some people on the street what was going on, they told me they were throwing a block party and attempting to construct the longest continuous picnic table in Hoboken’s history.</p>

<p>A lot of the architecture felt like some of the prettier neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Or maybe I’ve been duped and the prettier neighborhoods in Brooklyn just look like Hoboken?</p>

<p>Either way, I like Hoboken more and more each time I end up there. I want to say that it’s in Hoboken’s best interest that New Yorkers scoff at it- best to keep the snooty crowds in Manhattan. Yet I know that it’s yet another instance of New York’s hubris being its Achilles heel. We have so much to learn from other cities, whether they be Amsterdam’s cycling infrastructure, Mexico City’s Metrobus, or our own neighbor’s daylighting of intersections. Yet we’re a city entirely unwilling to listen and learn from others’ success. If you’re interested in learning far more details than you’re likely to care about: Alon Levy <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2024/08/07/more-on-american-incuriosity-new-york-regional-rail-edition-part-1-european-history/">talks far more intelligently</a> about how this hubris manifests in New York’s transportation policy.</p>

<p>I won’t go too far into the frustrations of being a safe streets advocate in New York. Ironically, when I set out for this photo walk I had a goal in mind to avoid taking any photos where New York appeared in the background. It was hard to do - Hoboken’s entire waterfront is dominated by the Manhattan skyline. Yet while I succeeded at avoiding New York in the visuals, here I am framing my entire post about Hoboken in comparison to New York.</p>

<p>It seems I haven’t expunged as much of my New York hubris as I thought I had. Maybe it’s for the best that New Yorkers can’t get over themselves: more Hoboken for the Hobokenites.</p>
