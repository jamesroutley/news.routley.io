	<dt>1. What are instant payments?</dt>
	<dd>Instant payments allow individuals and businesses to send and receive payments within seconds at any time of the day, on any day of the year, such that the receiver of a payment can use the funds almost instantly. This immediacy differentiates instant payments from traditional retail payment methods, including those that appear to occur within seconds from the sender’s perspective but can take many days before funds become available to the receiver. There is broad consensus within the U.S. payment community and among other stakeholders that, just as real-time services have become standard for other everyday activities, instant payment services have the potential to become widely used, resulting in a significant and positive impact on individuals and businesses throughout the country and on the broader U.S. economy.</dd>

	<dt>6. In addition to the FedNow Service, what other actions has the Federal Reserve taken to support the development of instant payments in the United States?</dt>
	<dd>Since 2013, there have been several collaborative initiatives between the Federal Reserve and industry stakeholders on strategies for improving the speed, safety, and efficiency of the nation’s payment system. In 2015, the Federal Reserve convened the Faster Payments Task Force (FPTF), a 320-member group comprised of a broad range of industry participants, to identify and assess alternative approaches for implementing safe and ubiquitous instant payment capabilities in the United States. In its final report, the FPTF identified the need for ongoing industry collaboration to address infrastructure gaps; to develop models for governance, rules and standards; and to consider actions and investments that will contribute to a healthy and sustainable payments ecosystem.</dd>

	<dt>11. Why does the Federal Reserve believe it is important to develop the FedNow Service?</dt>
	<dd>In assessing its criteria for new payment services, the Federal Reserve Board (Board) considers input from the public, historical experience, and its own analysis to assess whether such services can be expected to generate public benefits that private-sector services alone may be unable to achieve. Based on its assessment, the Board concluded that private-sector real-time gross settlement services for instant payments alone were unlikely to provide an infrastructure for instant payments with reasonable effectiveness, scope, and equity. In particular, private-sector services are likely to face significant challenges in extending equitable access to the more than 10,000 diverse depository institutions across the country. By contrast, the Federal Reserve is well positioned to overcome the challenge of extending nationwide access to an infrastructure for instant payments, thanks in large part to its existing nationwide payment infrastructure and established customer service relationships with more than 10,000 depository institutions (or their agents). Moreover, the development of the FedNow Service will likely yield clear and substantial benefits to the safety and efficiency of instant payments in the United States, as suggested by the majority of comments in response to the Board’s <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-11-15/pdf/2018-24667.pdf">2018 request for comment</a>.</dd>

	<dt>17. How will the FedNow Service work?</dt>
	<dd>The FedNow Service will process and settle individual payments within seconds, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Like other payment and settlement services offered by the Federal Reserve, the service will settle obligations between depository institutions through debit and credit entries to balances in their master accounts at the Reserve Banks. Consistent with the goal of supporting instant payments, use of the FedNow Service will include, as a term of service, a requirement that participants make the funds associated with individual payments available to their end-user customers immediately after receiving notification of settlement from the service.
