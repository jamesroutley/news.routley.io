    <h1>Ask HN: Are there any good open source text-to-speech tools?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are paid services that offer this (e.g. resemble.ai), and a few colab notebooks that I haven&#39;t found very helpful, but I wanted to know whether anyone here has had any luck with free text to speech (tts, t2s) tools. Thank you!</p></div></div>
