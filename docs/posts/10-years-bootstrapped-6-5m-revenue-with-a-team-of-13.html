    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-datocms-content-link-group="">  <p>As 2025 comes to a close, it&#39;s once again time to reflect. It’s been another packed twelve months, and it’s great to look back at everything we achieved, day by day. (Yes, we&#39;re patting ourselves on the back. It&#39;s our blog, we&#39;re allowed to.)</p><p>Want to take a walk down memory lane? Here are previous editions: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://exclav.es/blog/a-look-back-at-2024">2024</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://exclav.es/blog/a-look-back-at-2023">2023</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://exclav.es/blog/a-look-back-at-2022">2022</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://exclav.es/blog/a-look-back-at-2021">2021</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://exclav.es/blog/a-year-in-review">2020</a>.</p><hr/><h2> <mark>Financials:</mark> <strong>Strong growth, with best-in-class margins</strong> <a data-anchor="financials-strong-growth-with-best-in-class-margins" id="financials-strong-growth-with-best-in-class-margins"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#financials-strong-growth-with-best-in-class-margins"></a></h2><p>This year, we reached <strong>€6.5 million in revenue</strong>, a solid 10% year-over-year growth. Not that many companies still have double-digit growth after ten years! Most are either dead, laying off half their teams, acqui-hired, or pivoting to AI-something.</p><p>With our continued focus on sustainable operations and disciplined execution, we achieved an <strong>EBIT margin of 65%</strong>. To put this in perspective: while most SaaS companies celebrate 20-30% margins, and industry leaders hover around 40%, DatoCMS has reached a level of profitability that places us in the <strong>top 5% of SaaS companies globally</strong>.</p><p>For those familiar with SaaS metrics, the &#34;Rule of 40&#34; states that growth rate plus profit margin should exceed 40%. Ours is 75%. We&#39;re not bragging (okay, we&#39;re bragging a little) but it turns out that not burning through VC cash on ping-pong tables and &#34;growth at all costs&#34; actually works.</p><figure data-datocms-content-link-boundary=""> <prose-island> <p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150539-annual-recurring-revenue.svg"/></p> </prose-island> <figcaption>Annual Recurring Revenue</figcaption> </figure><h2> <mark>Partners:</mark> More and more of you are joining us <a data-anchor="partners-more-and-more-of-you-are-joining-us" id="partners-more-and-more-of-you-are-joining-us"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#partners-more-and-more-of-you-are-joining-us"></a></h2><p>With <strong>185 agency partners</strong> now fully enrolled in our <a href="https://exclav.es/partners">partner network</a> (<strong>!!!</strong>), we&#39;re genuinely blown away. These are people who build websites for a living, with real deadlines and real clients breathing down their necks. They don&#39;t have time for tools that get in the way — and they chose us. We don&#39;t take that for granted.</p><p>This year, we doubled down on making your work more visible. All that real work for real clients? It adds up — we now have 340 projects in the showcase (<strong>63 added this year alone!</strong>), enough that we had to <a href="https://exclav.es/partners/showcase" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">revamp the page with proper filters</a> so people can actually find things.</p><p>And what projects they are.

Either way, never felt so loved.</p><p>If you&#39;re an agency and you&#39;re not in the <a href="https://exclav.es/partner-program" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">partner program</a> yet — come on. We&#39;re not collecting logos here. We want to build a real relationship, learn what&#39;s slowing you down, and give you the perfect tool to ship quality work fast and painlessly. Half the features we shipped this year came from partner feedback. You&#39;re literally shaping the product. That&#39;s the whole point. No awkward sales calls, promise, we hate those too.</p><h2> <mark>Product:</mark> Another incredible round of improvements <a data-anchor="product-another-incredible-round-of-improvements" id="product-another-incredible-round-of-improvements"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#product-another-incredible-round-of-improvements"></a></h2><p>2025 has been another year of <strong>relentless shipping</strong>.

At the same time, we executed the most ambitious engineering project in our history: <strong>a complete migration from Heroku to a custom Kubernetes cluster on AWS</strong>.</p><p>For almost ten years, managed hosting served us well — but by mid-2024, we had hit a ceiling. Costs were rising while our need for granular control grew. We realized we were paying a premium for convenience we no longer needed. It was time to build our own home.</p><p>The journey began back in October 2024, kicking off a <strong>nine-month marathon</strong>. We spent the winter prototyping (experimenting with everything from bare metal to alternative PaaS providers — some of which shall remain unnamed to protect the guilty), the spring architecting, and the early summer stress-testing.</p><p>After months of planning, we flipped the switch on Saturday, June 7th. We prepared for a battle, but we mostly ended up watching dashboards. Aside from a tiny detail that cost us exactly <strong>1 minute</strong> of downtime, the transition was flawless. By the time we turned the writes back on, every byte of data had been successfully secured in AWS.</p><p>The results were immediate and startling:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Response times for the Content Delivery API (CDA) were <strong>halved</strong> instantly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> We are now running on <strong>64GB RAM</strong> database instances on AWS that handle traffic better than the <strong>256GB</strong> instances we used on Heroku. Yes, you read that right. Four times less RAM, better performance.</p></li></ul><p>It was a massive bet, but looking at the metrics today, it is undeniably one of the best wins of our year.</p><figure data-datocms-content-link-boundary=""> <prose-island> <img-lightbox> <a href="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;w=2000"><picture data-datocms-image="true">  <source srcset="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;dpr=0.25&amp;w=1000 250w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5&amp;w=1000 500w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75&amp;w=1000 750w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;w=1000 1000w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5&amp;w=1000 1500w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;dpr=2&amp;w=1000 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"/> <img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;w=1000" alt="" title="Response time, before and after the switch" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-testid="img"/> </picture> </a></img-lightbox>  </prose-island> <figcaption>Response time, before and after the switch</figcaption> </figure><p>We didn&#39;t just move servers and DBs; while moving our core applications to <strong>AWS EKS </strong>was the main event, we executed a total overhaul of the ecosystem surrounding it:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Infrastructure as Code:</strong> We codified our entire environment using <strong>Terraform</strong>, giving us a reproducible, version-controlled blueprint of our infrastructure that eliminates manual configuration drift.</p></li><li><p><strong>CDN Caching:</strong> We switched from Fastly to <strong>Cloudflare </strong>for our CDN cache, implementing smarter caching rules that improved our hit ratio from 85% to 97%.</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> We migrated from AWS S3 to <strong>Cloudflare R2</strong>, eliminating massive egress fees and optimizing asset delivery.

Mostly.</p><h2> <mark>Beyond code:</mark> Taking control of the books <a data-anchor="beyond-code-taking-control-of-the-books" id="beyond-code-taking-control-of-the-books"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#beyond-code-taking-control-of-the-books"></a></h2><p>While liberating ourselves from managed hosting, we made another quiet move: <strong>we fully internalized our accounting</strong>. For years, we outsourced this to external firms — the typical setup where you hand over receipts and hope for the best. But as we grew, flying blind between quarterly reports became untenable.</p><p>Now we run everything in-house with full visibility into our finances at any moment. No more waiting for external accountants to reconcile things. Same philosophy as the infrastructure migration: <strong>control beats convenience</strong> when you&#39;re building for the long term.</p><h2> <mark>Team:</mark> Still small by design <a data-anchor="team-still-small-by-design" id="team-still-small-by-design"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#team-still-small-by-design"></a></h2><p>This year marked our <strong>10th anniversary</strong> — a decade of surviving frontend trends, CMS wars, and the occasional existential crisis about whether &#34;headless&#34; is still a cool term. To celebrate, we flew our entire team to the Tuscan countryside to eat, drink, and ride quad bikes. You can read the full story of our trip (and our &#34;25% Matteo concentration rate&#34;) here: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://exclav.es/blog/dato-turns-ten"><strong>Dato Turns 10</strong></a>.</p><figure data-datocms-content-link-boundary=""> <prose-island> <embla-carousel> <div> <div data-viewport="">  </div> </div> </embla-carousel>  </prose-island> </figure><p>Despite our growth in revenue and traffic, we remain a team of just <strong>13 people</strong>. This isn&#39;t an accident — it&#39;s a deliberate choice.</p><p>As we wrote in <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://exclav.es/blog/how-can-you-be-eight-people"><strong>&#34;How can you be eight people?&#34;</strong></a> (well, now thirteen), building a massive organization is optional. We choose to ignore the pressure to maximize headcount or chase VC funding. Instead, we focus on what actually matters: a solid product, a healthy work-life balance, and staying profitable on our own terms. We don&#39;t mind &#34;leaving a little water in the cloth&#34; if it means we get to keep building the software we love, the way we want to build it.</p><h2> What&#39;s next? <a data-anchor="what-s-next" id="what-s-next"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#what-s-next"></a></h2><p>No idea. And honestly, we like it that way.</p><p>We&#39;re not going to pretend we have a five-year vision carved in stone or a slide deck about &#34;the future of content.&#34; We&#39;ll keep shipping what matters, keep ignoring the hype cycles, and keep cashing checks instead of burning through runway.</p><p>That said... <strong>we </strong><em><strong>may</strong></em><strong> have a few things cooking</strong> that we&#39;re genuinely excited about. But we&#39;re not going to jinx it by overpromising — you&#39;ll see them when they ship.</p><p>Well, see you in 2026. We&#39;ll still be here. Probably still 13 people. Definitely still not taking ourselves too seriously. 🧡</p>  </div></div>
