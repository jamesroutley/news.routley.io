    <h1>I’m going to miss you, but I am taking a sabbatical</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Hello, everyone. I’m going to be taking an extended break from kottke.org, starting today.  I’ve been writing here for more than <a href="https://kottke.org/22/03/24-years">24 years</a>, <em>nearly half my life</em> — I need a breather. This is something I have been thinking about and planning for years<sup id="fnref:1651783490"><a href="#fn:1651783490" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and I’d like to share why I’m doing it, how it’s going to work, what I hope to accomplish, and how you can help.</p>

<p>This is a long post and was a hard one to write — I hope you’ll give it your thoughtful attention. But first, let me introduce you to my plant.</p>

<p>(This is going somewhere. Trust me.)</p>

<p>Eight years ago when I still lived in NYC, I bought a fiddle leaf fig tree from a store in the Flower District. Here it is a couple of years ago, thriving next to my desk here in Vermont:</p>

<p><img src="https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/home-office.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="overhead view of my home office with a fiddle leaf fig tree"/></p>

<p>I’d recently moved into my own apartment after separating from my wife and figured a large plant in my new place would add some liveliness to a new beginning that was feeling overwhelming, lonely, and sad. For the first couple of months, I didn’t know if my tree and I were going to make it. I’d never really had a plant before and struggled getting a handle on the watering schedule and other plant care routines. It started losing leaves. Like, an alarming number of leaves.</p>

<p>I’d brought this glorious living thing into my house only to kill it! Not cool. With the stress of the separation, my new living situation, and not seeing my kids every day, I felt a little like I was dying too.</p>

<p>One day, I decided I was not going to let my fiddle leaf fig tree die…and if I could do that, I wasn’t going to fall apart either. It’s a little corny, but my mantra became “if my tree is ok, I am ok”. I learned how to water &amp; feed it and figured out the best place to put it for the right amount of light. It stopped shedding leaves.</p>

<p>The fig tree was a happy plant for several years after that. And I was ok because my plant was ok — I found new routines and rhythms in my altered life, made new traditions with my kids, got divorced, met new people, moved to a new state (w/ my family and tree), rediscovered who I was as a person, and, wonderfully and unexpectedly, forged a supportive and rewarding parenting partnership and friendship with my ex. We made it through that tough time together, that plant and me.</p>

<p>Recently however, my fiddle leaf fig has been struggling again. It’s been losing leaves and has become lopsided — some branches are going gangbusters while others are almost bare and the plant is listing so badly to one side that the whole thing tips over without the weight of water in the pot. This is what it’s looking like these days:</p>

<p><img src="https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/fiddle-leaf-fig-lean.jpg" width="1000" height="1178" alt="a majestic fiddle leaf fig tree leans precariously to one side in a bedroom"/></p>

<p>My plant is not ok. And neither am I — I feel as off-balance as my tree looks. I’m burrrrned out. I have been for a few years now. I’ve been trying to power through it, but if you’ve read anything about burnout, you know that approach doesn’t work.</p>

<p>I appreciate <em>so much</em> what I’ve built here at kottke.org — I get to read and learn about all sorts of new things every day, create new ideas and connections for people, and think in public — and I feel incredibly lucky to be able to set my own schedule, be my own boss, and provide for my family. But if you were to go back into the archive for the past several months and read the site closely, you’d see that I’ve been struggling.</p>

<p>Does what I do here make a difference in other people’s lives? In <em>my</em> life? Is this still scratching the creative itch that it used to? And if not, what needs to change? Where does kottke.org end and Jason begin? Who am I without my work? Is the validation I get from the site healthy? Is having to be active on social media healthy? Is having to read the horrible news every day healthy? What else could I be doing here? What could I be doing somewhere else? What good is a blog without a thriving community of other blogs? I’ve tried thinking about these and many other questions while continuing my work here, but I haven’t made much progress; I need time away to gain perspective.</p>

<p>· · ·</p>

<p>So. The plan, as it currently stands, is to take 5-6 months away from the site. I will not be posting anything new here.  I won’t be publishing the newsletter. There won’t be a guest editor either — if someone else was publishing here, it would still be on my mind and I’m looking for total awayness here. I’m planning on setting up a system to republish some timeless posts from the archive while I’m away, but that’s not fully in place yet. If you send me email (<a href="mailto:jason@kottke.org?subject=kottke.org%20feedback">please do!</a>), it might take me awhile to read it and even longer to reply — I plan to ignore my inbox as much as I can get away with. I probably won’t be on Twitter but will be more active <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jkottke/">on Instagram</a> if you want to follow me there.</p>

<p>The goal of my time away from the site is resting, resetting, recharging, and figuring out what to do going forward. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/04/21/t-magazine/culture-issue-creative-life-artists.html">this NY Times feature</a>, <a href="http://www.alexandrabell.com/">Alexandra Bell</a> said this about how art is made: “I need some space to think and live and have generative conversations and do things, and then I’ll make something, but I can’t tell you what it is just yet.” That’s the sort of energy I need to tap into for a few months.</p>

<p>Here’s the way I’ve been thinking about it: there’s a passenger ferry that goes from Cape Cod to Nantucket and there’s a stretch of time in the middle of the journey where you can’t see the mainland behind you and can’t yet see the island ahead — you’re just out in the open water. That’s what I need, to be in that middle part — to forget about what I’ve been doing here for so many years without having to think about where I’m going in the future. I need open water and 5-6 months feels like the right amount of time to find it.</p>

<p>· · ·</p>

<p>This is probably a good time to admit that I’m a little terrified about taking this time off. There’s no real roadmap for this, no blueprint for independent creators taking sabbaticals to recharge. The US doesn’t have the social safety net necessary to enable extended breaks from work (or much of anything else, including health care) for people with <a href="https://kottke.org/20/03/weird-internet-careers">Weird Internet Careers</a>. I support a lot of individual writers, artists, YouTubers, and bloggers through Substack, Patreon, and other channels, and over the years I’ve seen some of them produce content at a furious pace to keep up their momentum, only to burn out and quit doing the projects that I, and loads of other people, loved. With so many more people pursuing independent work funded directly by readers &amp; viewers these days, this is something all of us, creators and supporters alike, are going to have to think about.</p>

<p>I’ve said this many times over the past 5 years: kottke.org would not be possible today without <a href="https://kottke.org/21/11/its-membership-time">the incredible membership support</a> I have gotten from the people who read this site. Members have enabled this site to be free for everyone to read, enriching the open web and bucking the trend towards paywalling information online. I hope you will continue to support me in taking this necessary time off.</p>

<p>If, for whatever reason, you would like to pause/suspend your membership until I return, <a href="mailto:jason@kottke.org?subject=kottke.org%20memberships">email me</a> and I would be happy to do that for you. You’re also free of course to <a href="https://kottke.org/members">raise or lower your membership support here</a> if you’d like. Regardless of what you choose to do, I hope I will see you back here in the fall.</p>

<p>· · ·</p>

<p>If you’re curious about what’s on my agenda for the next few months, so am I! I’m leaving on a long-planned family trip soon, but other than that, I do not have any set plans. <a href="mailto:jason@kottke.org?subject=kottke.org%20feedback">Suggestions and advice are welcome!</a> I’d like to spend some unrushed time with my kids, who too often see me when I’m stressed out about work. I want to read more books. Watch more good movies. Take more photos. Go on pointless adventures. I want to exercise a little more regularly and figure out how to eat a bit better. Maybe travel some, visit friends or the ocean or both. Bike more. Stare at the walls. I hope to get a little bored. I need to tend to my fiddle leaf fig tree — if my tree is ok, I will be too.</p>

<p>I’m going to miss this — and all of you — more than I probably realize right now, but I’m ready for a break. I’ll see you in a few months.</p>

<p><em>*deep breath*</em></p>

<p>Here I go!</p>
