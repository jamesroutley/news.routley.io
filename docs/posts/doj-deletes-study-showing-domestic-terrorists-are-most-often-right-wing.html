<p>The Department of Justice has removed a study showing that white supremacist and far-right violence “continues to outpace all other types of terrorism and domestic violent extremism” in the United States. </p><p>The study, which was conducted by the National Institute of Justice and hosted on a DOJ website was available there at least until September 12, 2025, according to an archive of the page saved by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250911165140/https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/306123.pdf"><u>Wayback Machine</u></a>.</p><p>“The Department of Justice&#39;s Office of Justice Programs is currently reviewing its websites and materials in accordance with recent Executive Orders and related guidance,” reads a message on the page where the study was formerly hosted. “During this review, some pages and publications will be unavailable. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.”</p>
