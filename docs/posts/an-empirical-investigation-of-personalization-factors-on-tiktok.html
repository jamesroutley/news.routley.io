      <span>Abstract:</span>  TikTok currently is the fastest growing social media platform with over 1
billion active monthly users of which the majority is from generation Z.
Arguably, its most important success driver is its recommendation system.
Despite the importance of TikTok&#39;s algorithm to the platform&#39;s success and
content distribution, little work has been done on the empirical analysis of
the algorithm. Our work lays the foundation to fill this research gap. Using a
sock-puppet audit methodology with a custom algorithm developed by us, we
tested and analysed the effect of the language and location used to access
TikTok, follow- and like-feature, as well as how the recommended content
changes as a user watches certain posts longer than others. We provide evidence
that all the tested factors influence the content recommended to TikTok users.
Further, we identified that the follow-feature has the strongest influence,
followed by the like-feature and video view rate. We also discuss the
implications of our findings in the context of the formation of filter bubbles
on TikTok and the proliferation of problematic content.
