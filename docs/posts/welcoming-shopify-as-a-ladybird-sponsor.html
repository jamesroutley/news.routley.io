    <h1>Welcoming Shopify as a Ladybird sponsor</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>Hello friends!</p><p><span>I&#39;m super excited to announce that </span><a href="https://www.shopify.com/" rel="">Shopify</a><span> has stepped up to become the first ever corporate sponsor of the </span><a href="https://www.ladybird.dev/" rel="">Ladybird browser project</a><span>, generously contributing $100,000 USD!</span></p><p>Here&#39;s a quote from Mike Shaver, Distinguished Engineer at Shopify, on why they decided to back us:</p><blockquote><p>“Ladybird is a love-letter to the web, and proof that open technologies enable innovation by organizations of all sizes. Shopify grew up on those technologies, and proudly contributes to them. We’re excited to add Ladybird to the set of projects we support.”</p></blockquote><p>As you can imagine, I&#39;m pretty hyped! Not just about the financial support, but also about the massive vote of confidence in what we&#39;re doing. Of course, this accomplishment isn&#39;t mine alone. It&#39;s a testament to the dedication and hard work of our entire team who put so much of their time and love into Ladybird. I&#39;m so incredibly proud of the work everyone is doing!</p><p>In a time where big tech companies are giving up on their own browsers and consolidating on Chromium, it&#39;s up to hackers &amp; web enthusiasts like us to reintroduce diversity into the browser market. And that&#39;s exactly what we hope to do with Ladybird: to create an independent browser from scratch, free of 3rd party code, in classical open-source spirit.</p><p>A massive thank you to Shopify for believing in Ladybird! I can&#39;t wait to put the funds to work and see how far we can propel this thing. :)</p><p><span>Follow </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ladybirdbrowser" rel="">@ladybirdbrowser</a><span> on Twitter for updates and please reach out if you&#39;re interested in getting involved. Thanks for reading!</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
