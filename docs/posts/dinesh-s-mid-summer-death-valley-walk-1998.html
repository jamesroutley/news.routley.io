<td><p>The following is an account of our walk through Death Valley National Park during July 1998. We wanted to find out how it feels to walk in extreme heat for days at a time. We had set a goal of walking the entire park, from its northern boundary to its southernmost point, a distance of about 180 miles. Our plan was to walk 15 miles a day and finish the walk in 12 days. </p></td>
