    <h1>Ask HN: Programmers who don&#39;t use autocomplete/LSP, how do you do it?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am totally fascinated by programmers who don&#39;t use many of the IDE features I take for granted today: autocomplete, language servers, and recently copilot</p><p>So to the devs who don&#39;t use these tools, how do you do it? Do you just remember every type and field in a codebase? What does your flow look like?</p><p>One example is that I cannot live without the language server go-to-definition feature. What do you do if you need to look up the definition/implementation of some function which is in some other file?</p></div></div></div>
