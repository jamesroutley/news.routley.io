        <p>Welcome to the home of <b>ACARS Drama</b>, the leading provider of aircraft based drama ingestion services.</p>
        
        <p>This small companion website is designed to provide a brief overview of the ACARS Drama project, along with some code snippets and other information regarding the project, and how you can contribute.</p>
        
        <p>The latest drama ingested is shown below:</p>

        <p>A question I’ve been asked a few times since I took a little project I had for a year or so operating privately under my desk, and turned it into a social media bot.</p>
  
        <p>Note: this post is designed as a more high-level overview of what ACARS/VDLM2 messages are, and what my bot they feed is. So, if you’re looking for a more detailed technical overview of how the bot works, check out <a href="https://mike-sheward.medium.com/slack-messages-from-the-skies-9ea8ea9366f0">this earlier post from when it was first created as a Slack app</a>.</p>
  
        <p>When an aircraft is flying overhead, various radio signals are being transmitted and received by said aircraft constantly. Some examples of the radio signals, of course, are voice communications between pilots and air traffic controllers, that most people are familiar with. These are, of course, critical for safety, and ensuring planes are at the right altitude, going in the right direction, and at the right speed.</p>
  
        <p>In addition to voice, there are also a boat-load, well, plane-load I guess, of data signals. Amongst these data signals are the two types of signal that feed the bot’s insatiable thirst for drama. They are ACARS and VDLM2.</p>
  
        <p><strong>ACARS</strong>, which stands for Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, is a 1970’s era protocol that is still used today. A bunch of ground stations around the world are used to translate messages between computers in dispatch, maintenance and operations control rooms of the various airlines and their aircraft, and vice-versa, from the aircraft cockpit back to those airline computers.</p>
  
        <p><strong>VDLM2</strong>, which stands for VHF Data Link Mode 2, is similar in that it is a data transmission protocol that works over very high frequency (VHF) radio-waves, but it’s a bit more modern, uses different frequencies, is a bit faster, and can also carry ACARS messages.</p>
  
        <p>So, in summary, ACARS is where the drama usually is, sometimes transmitted in raw ACARS form, other times it is encapsulated in VDLM2. Same result all round really, you just have to look in a slightly different place to decode the ACARS inside of VDLM2 messages.</p>
  
        <p>Because I am a massive nerd when it comes to both radio stuff and planes (I was a PPL, almost did commercial but got rejected by the flight school I wanted to train at age 17 because I was ‘too quiet’, a problem I later rectified), I was able to buy a few relatively cheap bits of equipment that can listen for these signals from planes flying over my house, and using some open source software that other, much smarter people than me wrote, I was able to decode them. I then wrote some extra bits of software that fixes up the message (extracts only the human readable interesting bits, removes bad formatting etc), and turns it into the posts you see on ACARS Drama. That software also does the job of finding the aircraft photo and adding the tracking link too.</p>

        <h2>Harvest your sky drama!</h2>
        <p>If you would like to contribute to ACARS Drama, we&#39;d love to have you! It&#39;s very easy to get started, all you need is a $30 SDR (like an RTL-SDR), an antenna, some open source software, and Internet access. This is how:</p>
        
        <h3>Quick Start</h3>
        <p>If you already have an instance of <b>acarsdec, dumpvdlm2, or acars_router</b> running, then all you need to do is include our ingestion endpoint in your configuration.</p>
        
        <p>Send <b>ACARS</b> messages to: <b>feedthe.acarsdrama.com:5550</b></p>
        <p>Send <b>VDLM2</b> messages to: <b>feedthe.acarsdrama.com:5555</b></p>
        <p>The connection can be either UDP or TCP (UDP is preferred), and should be in JSON format (the default for the three tools mentioned above).</p>
        <p>acars_router is required to be able to send acarsdec/dumpvdlm2 traffic to multiple servers, so if you are already feeding elsewhere directly from acarsdec or dumpvdlm2, you will need to introduce an acars_router instance in your pipeline to continue to feed both.</p>
        <p>If you do start feeding, be sure to DM @acarsdrama@infosec.exchange, and let us know where you are!</p>
        <h3>Need a bit more guidance?</h3>
        <p>For information about running your own acarsdec, dumpvdlm2 and acars_router containers, have a read through <a href="https://mike-sheward.medium.com/slack-messages-from-the-skies-9ea8ea9366f0">this earlier post</a>, but remember you only need to do the container bit.</p>
        
        <p>Check out our <a href="https://github.com/msheward287/acars-drama-feeder-configs/blob/main/docker-compose.yml" target="_blank">sample config on Github</a> for an example of how you can set up a minimal container setup to feed the drama engine.</p>
