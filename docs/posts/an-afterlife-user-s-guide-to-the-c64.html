<h2>Introduction: Part I</h2>

<p>
	The Commodore 64 shipped with an official User&#39;s Guide, and many aftermarket books have been
	written about how to use and get the most out of your C64. What else is there to write on
	this subject?
</p>
<p>	
	In the year 2021, not only is the Commodore 64 forty years old, but the modern computing 
	environments we&#39;re used to have made the C64 seem even more foreign than it would 
	have seemed to computer enthusiasts back in the 80s. In my discussions online, at trade 
	shows and in private correspondence, I have learned that although many people are 
	still interested in and passionate about their C64, many lack a deep or comfortable familiarity 
	with actually <em>using</em> one.
</p>
<p>
	The goal of this document is not to be a comprehensive guide to everything your C64 can do.
	Rather, it is to reorient a modern computer user to the most important ways that the C64 works.
	It gives simple tips and tricks to help you understand what your C64 is doing, and how you
	can approach it in order to accomplish common tasks.

	To use your C64 effectively, take this wisdom to heart:
