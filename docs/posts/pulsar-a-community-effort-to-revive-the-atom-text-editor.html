That includes the website, package repository and GitHub organisation as well as the editor itself.</p><p>The below is just some items that we are currently working on that might answer any questions you have at this early stage of the project.</p><h3 id="downloads-and-releases" tabindex="-1"><a href="#downloads-and-releases" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Downloads and Releases</h3><p>We are still working on the editor to get to our first stable release.

What this means is that new versions will have to be obtained via the Cirrus CI or Download links here on our website. This is something on our roadmap to change as soon as possible.</p><h3 id="packages" tabindex="-1"><a href="#packages" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Packages</h3><p>One of our first and biggest tasks was to replace the closed source Atom.io package repository with our own so that users would still be able to download from the huge package ecosystem</p><p>Currently searching and downloading from the <a href="https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">package repository<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span>open in new window</span></span></a> is fully functional but other functions for maintaining packages such as publishing/updating/deleting are not yet functional.</p><h3 id="pulsar" tabindex="-1"><a href="#pulsar" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pulsar</h3><p>The releases do seem to be working for most people and use cases but if you have any problems then please do let us know in one of our <a href="https://pulsar-edit.dev/community.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community areas<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span>open in new window</span></span></a> or as a <a href="https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug%2Ctriage&amp;template=bug-report.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub issue<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span>open in new window</span></span></a></p><h4 id="known-issues" tabindex="-1"><a href="#known-issues" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Known Issues</h4><ul><li>macOS Performance: Currently performance on MacOS isn&#39;t what we hope to achieve.

We are very aware of this but our main focus is getting everything functional first and sort out the design later as the Atom sunset is fast approaching. We are still waiting on a finalized design for the branding (color schemes, final logo colors etc.) so most of what you see are just placeholders and will likely be updated shortly - the website design will then follow.</p></div></div></div>
