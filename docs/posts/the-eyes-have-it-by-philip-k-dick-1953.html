	<p>
	    This etext was produced from <cite>Science Fiction Stories</cite> 1953.
        Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.
        copyright on this publication was renewed.

	<div id="frontmatter"><blockquote id="editors_note">
			<p>A little whimsy, now and then, makes for good balance. Theoretically,
	        you could find this type of humor anywhere. But only
	        a topflight science-fictionist, we thought, could have written this
	        story, in just this way….</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		
	</div>
	<div id="story">
		<p><span>It was</span> quite by accident I discovered this incredible invasion of
		Earth by lifeforms from another planet. As yet, I haven’t done anything
		about it; I can’t think of anything to do. I wrote to the
		Government, and they sent back a pamphlet on the repair and maintenance
		of frame houses. Anyhow, the whole thing is known; I’m not
		the first to discover it. Maybe it’s even under control.</p>

		<p>I was sitting in my easy-chair, idly turning the pages of a paperbacked
		book someone had left on the bus, when I came across the reference that
		first put me on the trail. For a moment I didn’t respond. It took some
		time for the full import to sink in. After I’d comprehended, it seemed
		odd I hadn’t noticed it right away.</p>

		<p>The reference was clearly to a nonhuman species of incredible properties,
		not indigenous to Earth. A species, I hasten to point out, customarily
		masquerading as ordinary human beings. Their disguise, however,
		became transparent in the face of the following observations by the
		author. It was at once obvious the author knew everything. Knew
		everything — and was taking it in his stride. The line (and I tremble
		remembering it even now) read:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… his eyes slowly roved about the room.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Vague chills assailed me. I tried to picture the eyes. Did they roll
		like dimes? The passage indicated not; they seemed to move through
		the air, not over the surface. Rather rapidly, apparently. No one in the
		story was surprised. That’s what tipped me off. No sign of amazement
		at such an outrageous thing. Later the matter was amplified.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… his eyes moved from person to person.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>There it was in a nutshell. The eyes had clearly come apart from
		the rest of him and were on their own. My heart pounded and my
		breath choked in my windpipe. I had stumbled on an accidental mention
		<a id="page129" title="129"> </a>of a totally unfamiliar race. Obviously non-Terrestrial. Yet, to the
		characters in the book, it was perfectly natural — which suggested they
		belonged to the same species.</p>

		<p>And the author? A slow suspicion burned in my mind. The author
		was taking it rather <em>too easily</em> in his stride. Evidently, he felt this was
		quite a usual thing. He made absolutely no attempt to conceal this
		knowledge. The story continued:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… presently his eyes fastened on Julia.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Julia, being a lady, had at least the breeding to feel indignant. She
		is described as blushing and knitting her brows angrily. At this, I sighed
		with relief. They weren’t <em>all</em> non-Terrestrials. The narrative continues:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… slowly, calmly, his eyes examined every inch of her.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Great Scott! But here the girl turned and stomped off and the matter
		ended. I lay back in my chair gasping with horror. My wife and family
		regarded me in wonder.</p>

		<p>“What’s wrong, dear?” my wife asked.</p>

		<p>I couldn’t tell her. Knowledge like this was too much for the ordinary
		run-of-the-mill person. I had to keep it to myself. “Nothing,” I gasped.
		I leaped up, snatched the book, and hurried out of the room.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p><span>In the</span> garage, I continued reading. There was more. Trembling, I
		read the next revealing passage:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… he put his arm around Julia. Presently she asked him if
	        he would remove his arm. He immediately did so, with a
	        smile.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>It’s not said what was done with the arm after the fellow had removed
		it. Maybe it was left standing upright in the corner. Maybe it
		was thrown away. I don’t care. In any case, the full meaning was there,
		staring me right in the face.</p>

		<p>Here was a race of creatures capable of removing portions of their
		anatomy at will. Eyes, arms — and maybe more. Without batting an eyelash.
		My knowledge of biology came in handy, at this point. Obviously
		they were simple beings, uni-cellular, some sort of primitive single-celled
		things. Beings no more developed than starfish. Starfish can do
		the same thing, you know.</p>

		<p>I read on. And came to this incredible revelation, tossed off coolly by
		the author without the faintest tremor:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… outside the movie theater we split up. Part of us went
			inside, part over to the cafe for dinner.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Binary fission, obviously. Splitting in half and forming two entities.
		<a id="page130" title="130"> </a>Probably each lower half went to the cafe, it being farther, and the
		upper halves to the movies. I read on, hands shaking. I had really stumbled
		onto something here. My mind reeled as I made out this passage:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… I’m afraid there’s no doubt about it. Poor Bibney has lost
			his head again.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Which was followed by:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… and Bob says he has utterly no guts.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Yet Bibney got around as well as the next person. The next person,
		however, was just as strange. He was soon described as:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… totally lacking in brains.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<hr/>

		<p><span>There</span> was no doubt of the thing in the next passage. Julia, whom I
		had thought to be the one normal person, reveals herself as also
		being an alien life form, similar to the rest:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… quite deliberately, Julia had given her heart to the young
			man.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>It didn’t relate what the final disposition of the organ was, but I didn’t
		really care. It was evident Julia had gone right on living in her usual
		manner, like all the others in the book. Without heart, arms, eyes, brains,
		viscera, dividing up in two when the occasion demanded. Without a
		qualm.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… thereupon she gave him her hand.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>I sickened. The rascal now had her hand, as well as her heart. I shudder
		to think what he’s done with them, by this time.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… he took her arm.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Not content to wait, he had to start dismantling her on his own. Flushing
		crimson, I slammed the book shut and leaped to my feet. But not
		in time to escape one last reference to those carefree bits of anatomy
		whose travels had originally thrown me on the track:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… her eyes followed him all the way down the road and
			across the meadow.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>I rushed from the garage and back inside the warm house, as if the
		accursed things were following me. My wife and children were playing
		Monopoly in the kitchen. I joined them and played with frantic fervor,
		brow feverish, teeth chattering.</p>

		<p>I had had enough of the thing. I want to hear no more about it. Let
		them come on. Let them invade Earth. I don’t want to get mixed up
		in it.</p>

		<p>I have absolutely no stomach for it.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&#34;Defects,&#34; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#34;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#34; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&#39;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation&#39;s EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
