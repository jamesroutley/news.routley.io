                    <p>Here’s a scenario. First, you download an app for a service that has some sort
of in-person component, like picking up an order or meeting a driver at the
curb. When using that app for the goal, be it that order or that meeting, it’s
very helpful to have notifications, since they give you the current status
and it can be important to coordinate.</p>
<p>You’d like to get a notification for when your order is ready, since that takes
away the need for you to repeatedly poll the app and refresh constantly. This
makes sense.</p>
<p>You get your notification, you meet your driver or pick up your order, and all’s
well. Those notifications helped you coordinate during the transaction, and
hopefully you were able to pick up your order before it got too cold.  Maybe you
get a follow up notification to rate your experience, but other than that, these
notifications were helpful. You probably don’t even think about disabling them,
since maybe the next time you use the app you’ll want those helpful pings again.</p>
<p>Now it’s a week later, and you haven’t used the app since. Your phone lights up
with a notification from the same app.</p>

<p>Ahh, tricky. You want notifications during the transaction, the goal sequence,
the thing you downloaded the app for. They’ve got you to enable notifications,
since they can be helpful, but now they’ve co-opted that notification consent to
send you marketing notifications.</p>
<p>I don’t want to be notified that there are only 9 days left to try Devin
Booker’s salad (no offense to Devin Booker). I want to be notified when there
are things that need my attention in real time during this business transaction
we’re engaged in.</p>
<hr/>
<p>What are you going to do? The only control available (for me, at the time of
writing) is to disable notifications at the app level. That seems coarse
grained, especially since I do want some of those notifications. Am I really
going to enable and disable them every time I use the app? Maybe, but that’s
additional toil, and maybe I won’t always remember to. It would be nice if there were finer grained or more accessible controls, like
if there was an option when long-pressing the app on the home screen to quickly
enable or disable notifications.</p>
<p>Better yet, it would be great to have some sort of “disable marketing
notifications” inside the app. Great for us users, but not as great for the
companies that are knowingly using this channel for both useful and unuseful
notifications and their business engagement metrics. I say “knowingly”, because
it’s pretty clear when you look at something like Starbucks’ notifications
options:</p>
