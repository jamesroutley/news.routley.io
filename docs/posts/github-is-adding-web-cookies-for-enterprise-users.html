      <p dir="auto">Is the change from &#34;Personal Data&#34; to &#34;personal data&#34; a stylistic change?</p>
<p dir="auto">I note that the paragraph above is still intact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">All capitalized terms have their definition in <a href="https://github.com/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service">GitHubâ€™s Terms of Service</a>, unless otherwise noted here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Presuming this capitalization change is unintentional, it has the unfortunate effect of decoupling &#34;Personal Data&#34; from the definition provided in the GitHub Terms of Service, which means that &#34;personal data&#34; is no longer as delineated there, but could well be anything.</p>
<p dir="auto">If this is an intentional change, it would seem better made as a visible change to the Terms of Service. If the intent is not to change the Terms of Service but to arbitrarily expand &#34;personal data&#34; without drawing attention, well, that seems evil.</p>
