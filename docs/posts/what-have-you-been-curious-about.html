And that set will change depending on the day of the week. Or, also like me, you may be having that sort of week where you (mistakenly) &#34;know for sure, beyond a shadow of doubt&#34; that you have lost the curiosity directive. Basically, you might immediately (and once again, mistakenly) feel like a flake or a failure or some horrid in-between. I sure do.</p><p>Luckily, arguably, a more interesting, revealing, and kinder question is; &#34;What <em>have you been</em> curious about?&#34;.</p><p>You see as it happens, days glom into weeks, weeks into months and maybe even years. Only in hindsight do I discover that I <em>have been</em> non-casually curious about &#34;X&#34;. That my mind kept returning to that &#34;X&#34;. That it drove me to action in some way; a blog post written, a book read, a long discussion had, a life experiment attempted, a tutorial followed, a behaviour tried, an experience opted into etc.</p><p>For me the last year-plus became about examining the contents of my mind, identifying observing and acknowledging personal traits and oddities, making the self do things that past-me would scoff at or shy away from or fear, articulating what I want my professional life to be, and so forth.</p><p>I can tell that this has been the &#34;curiosity drive&#34; that I was so convinced I had lost permanently, because I recently created a <a href="https://www.evalapply.org/now">&#34;now&#34; page</a> that publicly reflects some of that, and ended up writing <a href="https://www.evalapply.org/posts/software-demos/">this blog post</a> about what I want to do for fun and money(!) and ended up applying for a second batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> (starting soon!).</p><p>That sounded like heavy work, but I have honest-to-goodness been <em>playing</em> in the sense of <em>serious play</em>. Among other things, I have re-framed <em>&#34;adult&#34;</em> as <em>&#34;still an impish, wide-eyed, curious thirteen year old underneath sediments and crusty</em> <em>layers of accreted life experiences and beliefs and rules and… just <strong>stuff</strong>&#34;</em>.</p><p>And I feel a looking-back-to-curiosity exercise has power to shed light on where to look ahead (and why to do it). More so, I feel it has power to grant permission to that &#34;insatiably curious thirteen year old self&#34; to step out and <em>play</em>. Because it probably already has been up to something, while your attention was elsewhere.</p><p>So, here is a prompt (see what I just did there? ;-)) …</p><p><strong><em>What <em>have you been</em> curious about?</em></strong></p><p>LLAP _\\//</p><p>(NB: This is a lightly edited version of my newsletter that went out today.)</p></section></article></main></div></div>
