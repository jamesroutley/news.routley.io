    <h1>Ask HN: Is it possible to make FAANG salaries without working there?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The gap between FAANG and non-FAANG salaries is quite substantial. For example, a Staff Engineer at an avg startup might get $250k base salary, in a HCOL area and maybe a 10-20% bonus.</p><p>But a FAANG Staff Engineer will get a similar base, and then $1mil in stock for 4 years.</p><p>-- Are there people outside of FAANG and Big Banks / HFT firms making those kinds of monies?</p><p>-- if So who are they? and what do they do?</p></div></div></div>
