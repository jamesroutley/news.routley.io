<u><b>1) Mission of the Nike Computer</b></u></a></SPAN>

</p><blockquote>
<p>
The Nike Computer had the following main missions:
</p><ul>

<li>a) Provide Predicted Intercept Point and Predicted Flight Time 
      to Plotting Board - for human viewing

</li><li>b) Provide Predicted Intercept azimuth angle to missile during pre-launch
</li><li>c) Provide Missile Steering commands after launch
</li><li>d) Provide Missile Burst command at correct time after launch
</li><li>e) (The <a href="#About">Nike Hercules Computer</a> had an added Surface-to-Surface function.)
</li><li>f) And of course be easy to test,  highly reliable, accurate, testable and maintainable
</li><li>g) - and be compact enough to  fit into a van with other equipment and functions.
</li></ul>

<p>
There were three main modes:
</p><ol>
<li> Test
</li><li> Pre-Launch - Compute Predicted_Intercept_Point and Time_of_Flight to plotting boards
</li><li> Post-Launch - add Missile_Steering and Burst commands
</li></ol>

<p>
a) The <b>Predicted Intercept Point</b> is the point where the missile
   would intercept the aircraft if:
   </p><ul>
   <li>the aircraft continued in a straight path and at the same speed
   </li><li>the missile was fired right now
   </li></ul>

<dd>

   and the <n>Predicted Flight Time is the time from now for that meeting.</n></dd><dd>
The Missile Burst Command is sent via pulse codes through the missile tracking radar.
<p>


e) <b>And of course be  highly reliable, accurate, testable and maintainable.</b>

	</p><p>
The <b>only alternative that was reliable enough and accurate enough</b> was the 
electronic analog computer, which could
be implemented for the Nike with fewer than 500 vacuum tubes.  There were failures, but the
technology was maturing, the tubes were run in a different (not ON/OFF) manner,
 and the uptime exceeded 99% at most sites. (One failure a month was considered really 
poor.)

</p><p>
(<b>In the late 1970s, the analog computer was replaced by a digital computer,</b> a
 PDP-11 W (running the RT-11 operating system. Two of the 4 analog computer cabinets 
	became closets and storage space.)

<p>

From the deployment of Nike in <b>1954 to the mid 1970&#39;s</b>, the Nike Computer was an 
<b>analog computer</b>. 
 That means that distances, times, and other values were not digital bit representing 
numbers (like 12.3)  but were (in this case) voltage values (like 12.3 volts).
</p><p>
The values as stated above were voltages, and simple circuits 
(using 76 &#34;operational amplifiers&#34; of 2.5 tubes each)
could quickly <b>(1 microsecond)</b>:
</p><ul>

<li> add or subtract 2 or more variables 
</li><li> determine rate of change (of distance giving velocity)
</li><li> multiply or divide a variable by a constant 


</li><li> approximate a function to 1 %
</li></ul>

<dd>

but <b>slower motor driven potentiometers</b> were required to:
<ul>
<ul>

<li> multiply or divide a variable by a variable
</li><li> store a variable for a long time (minutes or hours) (not needed in anti-aircraft)
</li><li> generate a precision non-linear function 

</li></ul>

</ul>
Each amplifier had a nominal gain of 20,000

<ul>

<li> most amplifiers used &#34;semi-precision&#34; zero set switches with gains of 200, giving effective gains of 4 million.
</li><li> about 6 amplifiers used &#34;precision&#34; (re-entrant) zero setting, with gains of 3,000.
</li></ul>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
There were 2 operational amplifiers using a total of 5 tubes on a chassis.  The output
tube was a dual triode, 1/2 of the tube was the final amplifier for an amplifier.
The &#34;plate&#34; (where the electrons landed) of the final amplifier could be swung 
between -100 volts and +100 volts using the required external load resistor.

The Nike anti-aircraft problem did not require many slow motor driven circuits 
(about 7) and used about 100 of the simple fast circuits. It also used numerous
relays to change between the various modes of operation (test, pre-launch, post-launch).

<p>
An interesting characteristic of analog computers is that the <b>circuits tend to 
run in parallel</b>, The relatively slow circuits all working together easily  keep
up with the anti-aircraft problem in real time.

</p><p>
	An analog computer (distances and times were voltages) used
	analog (voltage) inputs from the Target Tracking and Missile Tracking Radars.<br/>

</p><p>
	
	These values (and derived target and missile velocities) were
	used to calculate the remaining flight time and Predicted 
	Intercept point.  The missile was guided to the predicted
	intercept point by the computer generated steering commands 
	sent through the Missile Tracking Radar.  <br/></p><p>

  In the late 1970&#39;s a <b>digital computer</b> was made available for the Nike.  These were sent to
  &#34;off-shore&#34; locations as all U.S. sites had been de-activated.  It is quite possible
  that this computer was a Norden PDP-11M.  This was a licensed version of the 
  DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation) PDP-11 that was housed in a tougher case
  and made more vibration resistant and in other ways made more suitable for
  a military environment. 

</p><p>
   It is known that the file system format on the floppy disks was RT-11M.
(I have two floppies reported to be from a Nike site, but cannot figure out the data/program.)  It had
  two 8 inch floppy disk drives, a printer, (and some I/O cards).
As as best I can determine, the tracking antenna potentiometers
       were retained - the analog voltages being converted to
       digital for digital computing. Maybe the same for the range pot??


</p><p>

Any information about a digital Nike much appreciated.

<div><pre><b>
&#34;  On the right hand side of the computer cabinet under
the computer power control panel, there was a little monitor
about 10 by 6 inches, and a keyboard.
There under a printer. The printer printed out sampled data
every 100 msec. During a sim track, data were sampled
every 100 msec and printed out.
For me it was heaven. I already re-calculated a lot
of the system capabilities and used the computer during
live ECM and T1 ECM exercises.

Finally I determined the radar cross section (RCS) of  targets and
found that the T1 was wrong by/in determining the radar resolution
cell LP/SP and therefor misinterpreted the amount of chaff that
could be fitted in a resolution cell.

Well,  that sounds academic but it was the greatest success
for me and the reason for many unsuccessful ratings of the
crew performances.
I found out what the real RCS was for a specific airplane
but that was secret.
The Airforce told (ordered) me not to talk about it.

<div>
Thought I would tell you a story that relates to the panel that one of your contributors asked about

{above}
<p>
When I was getting out of engineering school in 1978, I was working for a company in Buffalo, New York named Sierra Research. 
</p><p>
By the way, this is the same company that built the zero set switches that you have pictures of on the same page. The circuit boards have the Sierra federal company code (12115) and some of the potted transformers actually have the Sierra Research name on them. The way the part numbers worked at Sierra was that the first two digits of the first group of four digits was the year of the contract that the part was for. The second two digits for circuit boards and things that were developed that were contract specific were the contract number for that year. For special part, like the transformers, other codes were used. The circuit cards for the zero set switch all have 6900 as the first four digits - meaning that these were designed for the first contract in 1969. Way before I joined the company. But this should help you place when the motor driven zero set switches were replaced with the electronic version.
</p><p>
Anyhow, the story about the digital to analog converter panel in the picture. The panel was part of a modification to replace the range and angle pots with microprocessors. The RSPUs (Radar Signal Processing Units -one for the MTR and one for the TTR) were mounted in the cabinet where the original range pots lived in the radar van. The original range pots were no longer used, the return video being processed by some fast digital logic coupled to an 8080 microprocessor. The angle pots were modified to remove the sine and cosine potentiometers. These were replace with an 8 pole resolver mounted directly on the 9:1 shaft of the pot. This resolver signal along with an existing 1:1 resolver signal were fed into converters in the RSPUs and another 8080 computed the pointing angles from resolvers along with the sine and cosine of the azimuth and elevation. Another microprocessor in each RSPU (we are up to six now - but they were only operating at 2.0 megahertz) combined the range and angle data to compute the various things that the original analog pots computed - slant range, X and Y along with the velocities of these things. A single microprocessor in one of the RSPUs (that would be number 7) then packaged this all for a data link to the battery control van, via a single coax cable.
</p><p>
The panel that you show was on the other end of the data link. This box contained a temperature controlled compartment (ECU - heater/cooler switch lower right) which contained an 18 bit multiplexed digital to analog converter. The converter also included ramping between the updates by use of the velocity components computed in the RSPU. The output of the converter was fed into the original analog computer. The velocity ramps were needed to help keep the digital sampling noise out of the analog circuits.
</p><p>
These modifications were performed on many of the Nike sites in Germany around the 1979/1980 time frame. 
</p><p>
Anyhow, as a young engineer, I learned a bunch from helping put this equipment together. The documentation on the various signal flows along with the schematics of the radar equipment was top notch from my point of view, the organization of the actual equipment in racks and drawers supported trouble shooting even in a small space. A truly complex piece of equipment that was modularized to be maintainable. Not much that I have worked on since  has come close to this. 
</p><p>
Just thought I would give you some of the story on that panel.

<p>


    To <b>keep flight times down</b>, (and increase the effective range) 
    the <b>missile is aimed ahead of the target</b> at a calculated 
    <b>Predicted Intercept Point</b>.  If the aircraft flies a straight
    line, the missile horizontal flight path will also be straight.
    (A dog chasing a target runs directly toward the target,
     involving a longer run if the target runs straight.)


</p><p>

	A person can worry that assuming that airplane flying straight might not
	be a good assumption, but what better can you make?   One can wonder about
	the 10 million year success of dog-like creatures running directly toward the
	present position of their intended prey.  However their prey can change direction and
	percent speed much faster than an aircraft.  Dog chase path succeeds with a slightly
	different problem.

  </li><li> Using a Trial Missile Flight Time, the position of the plane at the

  </li><li> Using the same Trial Missile Flight Time, and a trial missile azimuth,
        the postion of the missile at the end of that time is estimated

	At longer ranges (flight times) the <b>Predicted Intercept Point can
	vary greatly</b> due to target aircraft maneuvers.  The battery commander
	must make allowances for many possibilities.

	The missile must not fly directly over the Missile Tracking Radar (MTR)
	because of limitions inherent in that type of antenna mount and the pointing system.
	To avoid flying directly over the MTR, special circuits are included in the computer
	to fly the missile in a path skirting around a flight path over the MTR.
	This situation is normally avoided by placing the launching area toward the expected
	direction of enemy aircraft - but the battery can be effective in any case.
	</p><p>
    A full dive command (7 g&#39;s) is sent to the missile to dive it 
    from vertical toward horizontal.    When the missile has reached a vertical angle
    that will be a good (1/2 g) flight path to the intercept point, the 
    full dive command is removed and normal steering begins.

  After the 7 g dive, the computer flies the missile on a
     <a href="https://www.ed-thelen.org/flight.html#end_dive">1/2 g flight path</a> to the predicted
   intercept point.
   For further details of the 1/2 g flight path, see  page 64 of

    The predicted intercept point is constantly being updated by 
    the computer from data from the target tracking radar and 
    the missile tracking radar. Using the missile position from the Missile Tracking Radar,
    missile velocity and attitude generated in the computer, and the Predicted Intercept
    Point, the <b>computer generates analog steering commands in gravity units
	(g&#39;s) </b> for the missile.  These
    commands are sent to the Missile Tracking Radar, where the analog commands are
    converted into radar pulse sequences indicating the command to the missile.

</p><p>
    
    About 0.1 seconds before the missile will be closest to the 
    target, a missile burst command is send by a coded pulse 
    sequence to the missile by the missile tracking radar.   
    This burst command is decoded and the missile warhead exploded.
    The goal is to <b>explode the missile just before</b> (10 meters) the missile
    would impact (or be at the closest point with)  the aircraft.
    This way, the expanding blast of fragements goes through the space where
    the target aircraft would be - giving <b>maximum damage even if a near miss</b>.

<u><b>7) Steering Command Details</b></u></a></SPAN><a name="Steering"><br/>
</a><blockquote><a name="Steering">

	The steering commands are basically to climb/dive and 
	turn left/right a given number of earth gravitational acceleration
	 units 	(g forces of fighter plane fame).  As an example,
 	the computer might command the missile to turn right at a
	rate of 1.0 g&#39;s.  The missile would adjust its fins to turn
	hard enough so that the left/right accelerometer would indicate
	1.0 g&#39;s right.<p>

	Actually the missile fins are 45 degrees from horizontal,
	 and the <b>accelerometers are also 45 degrees from horizontal</b>.
 	 The last stage of the <b>computer rotates the command</b> so that a 
	 1.0 g right command will be sent as 0.707 g up/right and 0.707 g down/right 
	 which will result in 1.0 g turn right. You do remember your high school
	 trig - don&#39;t you?  Oh yes, you must be a &#34;rocket scientist&#34;.
	</p></a><p><a name="Steering">

	The missile steering commands are sent in analog form to the 
	Missile Tracking Radar electronics where they are converted to
	radar pulse pairs which  are received by the missile.
	For a description of the commands as they are sent by the Missile Tracking
	Radar see </a><a href="https://www.ed-thelen.org/ifc_track.html#mtr">Missile Tracking Radar</a>.
</p><p>
	About 0.1 second before 	intercept, a burst command is sent 
	to explode the missile and hopefully disable the target.

	<u><b>9) How does the computer know the radar offsets? </b></u></a></SPAN>

</p><blockquote> 

The <b>Target Tracking Radar (TTR) is considered the center of the world</b>,
well at least as far as the computer and IFC people are concerned.
All distances are measured from the TTR.  Plotting board distances and elevations 
 are relative to the TTR.

<p>
The computer must know where the Missile Tracking Radar (MTR) is 
	relative to the Target Tracking Radar (TTR), 
and also the relative location of the Target Ranging Radar (TRR)
	relative to the Target Tracking Radar (TTR).
This permits the computer to subtract out the positional differences, so that
<b>all three radars are, for computational purposes, located at the same point
is space</b>. 

</p><p>
The offsets of the MTR and the TRR are dialed into potentiomenters located
on the computer.  The coordinates are as North/South, East/West, Up/Down from
the Target Tracking Radar.  Any errors dialed into these potentiometers will cause
errors in flying the missile to the exact position of the target.
</p><p>
The positional differences of the various acquisition radars are not important
because they are always within 50 yards of the TTR and errors in range and
parallax due to this offset do not affect operation (primarily the locking
on to the designated target by the TTR operators).   It is <b>important that 
the acquisition radars and the TTR (and any area supervision radars) have the 
same &#34;North&#34; reference</b> to within about a degree for more exact target designation.
(Which target is it?)


</p><p>

  	The Tracking Radars have the same North very precisely due to their
	alignment procedures.
