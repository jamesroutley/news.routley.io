    <h1>Ask HN: Any insider takes on Yann LeCun&#39;s push against current architectures?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>So, Lecun has been quite public saying that he believes LLMs will never fix hallucinations because, essentially, the token choice method at each step leads to runaway errors -- these can&#39;t be damped mathematically.</p><p>In exchange, he offers the idea that we should have something that is an &#39;energy minimization&#39; architecture; as I understand it, this would have a concept of the &#39;energy&#39; of an entire response, and training would try and minimize that.</p><p>Which is to say, I don&#39;t fully understand this. That said, I&#39;m curious to hear what ML researchers think about Lecun&#39;s take, and if there&#39;s any engineering done around it. I can&#39;t find much after the release of ijepa from his group.</p></div></div></div>
