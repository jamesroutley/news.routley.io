    <h1>The cottage industry of YouTube obituary pirates</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>While some YouTubers exclusively post obituary content, others intersperse obituary readings with summaries of other news. One of these channels, Event Click, recently posted photos of an orangutan throwing a possum from its enclosure in Australia’s Perth Zoo. “I would presume it did not survive the fall,” says a robotic voice narrating the video. Before I could watch that video, I had to watch an ad from Etsy. (WIRED reached out to several companies whose ads appeared before obituary videos for comment, including BetterHelp, 1-800-Flowers, and Etsy. As of this writing, none have responded.)</p><p>Anjali Bal, a marketing professor at Babson College in Massachusetts, finds these videos “morbid and weird” and views the business strategy as ultimately short-sighted. They play on a surge of interest in keywords related to recent deaths, pumping out low-effort content in an attempt to capitalize on this temporary flow of web traffic. “In the short term it boosts the page,” she says. “In the long term these things are uncomfortable for the consumer and will not lead to long-term engagement.”</p><p><span>This genre, while</span> bizarre, does have analogs, albeit ones that seem far more aligned with the public interest. Short-form video is an increasingly central source of news, including videos that repackage original reporting from elsewhere for viewers with shorter attention spans. This isn’t always a bad thing; a TikToker named Kelsey Russell, for instance, has gained an audience by <a data-offer-url="https://embedded.substack.com/p/gen-z-loves-the-newspaper-on-tiktok" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://embedded.substack.com/p/gen-z-loves-the-newspaper-on-tiktok&#34;}" href="https://embedded.substack.com/p/gen-z-loves-the-newspaper-on-tiktok" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recapping</a>  pieces from <em>The New York Times</em> for a younger generation. While the YouTube obituary videos lack Russell’s panache or thoughtfulness, the most generous reading is that they too recap information that audiences are seeking out in an easily-digestible form.</p><p>The rise of this type of video is also directly connected to a broad and enduring cultural fascination with mortality. Obituaries are big business because people are captivated by death; this is one reason serial-killer content has turned into such a reliably popular genre. “Reading obituaries seems like a budget version of the true crime format,” says Josh Cohen, founder of the creator-economy news website TubeFilter. As Cohen points out, YouTube is filled with people copying what works. “There’s tons of knockoffs,” he says.</p><p>In the past, obituary pirates have <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/afterlife-obituary-class-action-lawsuit-1.5119601">been punished</a> for their misdeeds. In 2019, for example, a Canadian website called Afterlife that scraped and republished obituaries was ordered to pay $20 million (CDN) in restitution to grieving families. In that case, the class action plaintiffs successfully argued that lifting the obituaries and accompanying photos they’d put online to honor their loved ones was copyright infringement. But in more recent examples, the YouTuber obituary pirates tend to summarize information they’ve found online, rather than repeating it verbatim. While distasteful, it’s not illegal to callously recount the details of other people’s misfortune. (If it were, several prominent true-crime podcasters would certainly be in jail.)</p><p>It seems unlikely that this trend will die down as long as there’s money to be made, even if it’s a modest sum—and the rise of AI tools may make the situation even more infuriating. Last week, Microsoft’s MSN news site was roundly castigated for an incoherent and <a data-offer-url="https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-brandon-hunter-useless-ai-obituary-432008" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-brandon-hunter-useless-ai-obituary-432008&#34;}" href="https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-brandon-hunter-useless-ai-obituary-432008" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">oddly hostile</a> obituary for former NBA player Brandon Hunter; critics assumed the garbled article was written by AI, as the company had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/30/microsoft-sacks-journalists-to-replace-them-with-robots">laid off</a> human staffers in favor of algorithmically generated content three years earlier. (Microsoft never confirmed whether the offending story was AI-generated, but it was removed nonetheless.)</p><p>My friend’s experience struck him as strange and crass enough to ask a tech reporter—me—if I’d ever heard of it. But what is viewed as creepy now may look quaint in the future. Considering how the obituary pirates on YouTube prioritize speed and volume above coherence and dignity, it’d be more surprising if they didn’t embrace artificial intelligence in their quest to profit off curiosity and heartache.</p></div></div></div></div>
