    <h1>Ask HN: What Happened to Pinboard (Dec &#39;22 edition)?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Well here we are again... it appears that the archiving function (to which I subscribe) is degraded - URLs crawled since about May 22 that landed on cache5.pinboard.in just return 404 (or in one case, garbage) when accessed; perhaps the drive is full? Anyone else noticed the same? Older links still seem to work OK.</p><p>I notice that idlewords is recently active on HN despite being impossible (for me at least) to get hold of by email - if you&#39;re reading this, would you resolve the above issue at least? Then I can finish manually scraping the archive I have built up, since I&#39;ve been unable to persuade you to prepare a backup of it for me and I&#39;m now concerned the site will go offline without warning.</p></div></div></div>
