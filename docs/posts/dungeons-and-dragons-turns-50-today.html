Consequently, if Jon opines that <a href="https://playingattheworld.blogspot.com/2013/12/when-dungeons-dragons-turns-40.html">January 26, 1974 is the day on which <i>D&amp;D </i>was released</a> – and, therefore, the game&#39;s birthday – I&#39;m inclined to trust his judgment. So, happy birthday <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>! For the last half-century, you&#39;ve entertained untold millions of people across the globe, providing them with a delightful means to exercise their imaginations together with their friends. </p><p><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </i>played an outsize role in popularizing fantasy literature, ideas, and themes, as well as inspiring many of its devotees to <a href="https://grognardia.blogspot.com/2023/11/be-creator-not-consumer.html">create their own</a>. Roleplaying, as a formal activity, owes nearly its entire existence to the phenomenal success of <i>D&amp;D. </i>Even more remarkable is the extent to which the computer and video game industry, which is bigger and more profitable than the music and movie industries <i>combined</i>, owes a huge debt to the example set by <i>D&amp;D. </i>If you play any game with classes or levels or experience or hit points today, that&#39;s because of <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</i></p><p>It&#39;s slightly crazy if you think about it. Two wargamers from the American Midwest created <a href="https://grognardia.blogspot.com/2023/12/a-new-genre-itself.html">an entirely new type of entertainment</a>, one that, over the course of five decades, <i>changed the world forever. </i>That&#39;s no small accomplishment – and it&#39;s certainly worth celebrating. </p>
