    <h1>Not quite a successful prediction about tracking Apple stuff</h1>
    
    
<p>
Just a hair over 10 years ago, I wrote a
<a href="/w/2011/12/25/telemetry/">post</a>
lamenting the fact that my WiFi-only original iPad (which was new at the 
time) was probably a mistake.  After all, if I took it outside my house 
and away from the one wireless network it knew, it was now cut off from 
the Internet.  If someone stole it or if I left it behind somewhere, 
there would be no way to track it down or wipe it.
</p><p>
Well, times change, and now that's no longer a concern.  Pretty much 
anything that Apple sells nowadays that is intended to be portable is 
also 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_My_network">trackable</a>, 
even if it's "off" (whatever that even means now).  Obviously I'm 
talking about AirTags, but the phones, watches, iPads, and yes, even 
laptops have the ability to be found in the same way if they are new enough.
</p><p>
When I thought about this at the time, I figured maybe they'd do some 
kind of one-way wifi and satellite-based "push" system where you could 
send "kill signals" for stolen devices.  Yeah, that was a pretty bad 
call.  It didn't end up even close to that.  Instead, now, just every 
other Apple device in the vicinity has the ability to hear a beacon 
from a missing device and report about where it was found.
</p><p>
That plus the whole activation lock thing where a device won't let you 
use it unless the previous owner releases it from their iCloud account 
hopefully put a pretty big dent in the utility of stealing these things.  
Even with that, you still hear about people knocking over Apple stores 
and stealing armloads of devices for some reason.  It must be for the 
non-serialized parts, since the rest of them will surely tattle if they 
are ever connected to the "mothership" again.
</p><p>
Looking at it another way, I no longer worry about this kind of thing.  
It's as if they saw something that might keep people from wanting to buy 
a certain class of device and then did something about it.  How about 
that?
