      redefined support for creatives and also embodied the spirit of ingenuity and generosity.</p> <p>From our first day to this graceful finale, you&#39;ve been the heart of our story. Your
      enthusiasm and belief in our mission transformed a simple idea into a thriving ecosystem for
      artists and innovators.</p> <p>This year, we briefly expanded our horizons with the Anti-adblock Pass service, aspiring to
      further empower your digital experience. Although this chapter was short, it was driven by our
      unwavering commitment to serve your needs and break new ground.</p> <p>As we draw the curtains on both ventures, we want to extend our deepest gratitude. Every
      donation you made was a testament to your faith in creativity.</p> <p>Thank you for walking this path with us, for sharing our vision, and for being the cornerstone
      of this remarkable journey. May the future bring you endless creativity, joy, and success.</p> <p>Until we meet again,</p> <p>The Flattr Team</p> </div></div></main>
