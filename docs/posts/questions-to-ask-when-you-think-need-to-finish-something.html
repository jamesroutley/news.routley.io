    <h1>Questions to ask when you think need to finish something</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-bvzihdzo="">  <p>I’ve written before about how I am sometimes <a href="https://cassidoo.co/post/side-project-haunting/">haunted by my own side projects</a> that I should finish, but I also want to pursue a shiny new thing instead.</p>
<p>After shipping some projects (like <a href="https://cassidoo.co/post/pocketcal-build-log/">PocketCal</a> and <a href="https://cassidoo.co/post/ductts-build-log/">Ductts</a>, among others), I think I’ve refined my list of questions that I ask myself when I want to avoid working on an existing project and pursue something else instead. And now… I give them to you.</p>
<h2 id="ask-yourself">Ask yourself…</h2>
<ul>
<li>Does this thing still align with my current goals?</li>
<li>Would I start this again if I hadn’t already invested time and resources into it?</li>
<li>Do I still want this, or am I trying to prove to myself that I can finish it?</li>
<li>What would happen if I let this go?</li>
<li>Am I trying to meet my own expectations, or someone else’s?</li>
<li>What would I actively pursue if I didn’t finish this thing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, doing a little “mental audit” around projects have helped me ship better when I realize some projects I pursue aren’t actually worth it to me.</p>
<p>And sometimes, the answers to these questions help me actually finish a project, because my answer reminds me of why I started it in the first place!</p>
<p>I hope this helps you!</p>  </div></div>
