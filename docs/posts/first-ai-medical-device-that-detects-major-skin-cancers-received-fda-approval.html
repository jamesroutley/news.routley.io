<h3 id="h-how-dermasensor-works"><strong>How DermaSensor Works</strong></h3>



<h4 id="h-1-non-invasive-scanning-process"><strong>1. Non-Invasive Scanning Process</strong></h4>



<p>DermaSensor looks similar to a smartphone with a pointed tip on the bottom that is used to scan skin lesions. When the tip touches the skin, it projects different wavelengths of light that penetrate the skin and interact with cells. Healthy cells absorb and reflect light differently than cancerous cells based on changes at the subcellular level. An integrated AI model can analyze these light interaction patterns and identify characteristics that can indicate the presence of melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma.</p>



<h4 id="h-2-ai-based-risk-assessment"><strong>2. AI-Based Risk Assessment</strong></h4>



<p>Within seconds of scanning a mole or lesion, DermaSensor provides physicians with an automatic risk assessment of either “investigate further” or “monitor”. This gives doctors an objective second opinion to aid biopsy decisions and diagnoses without having to rely solely on visual examination or their subjective judgment, which can sometimes miss subtle signs of cancer. The device does not make a formal cancer diagnosis but flags suspicious lesions for closer evaluation by a dermatologist.</p>

<h3 id="h-evidence-of-effectiveness"><strong>Evidence of Effectiveness</strong></h3>



<h4 id="h-1-results-from-clinical-trials"><strong>1. Results From Clinical Trials</strong></h4>



<p>The FDA approval was based on results from a multicenter <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/cls-20517097">clinical trial led by the Mayo Clinic</a> involving over 1,000 patients across 22 clinics. In this study, DermaSensor demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting 224 skin cancers, with a 96% true positive rate. It also showed excellent specificity, correctly identifying benign lesions 97% of the time to reduce unnecessary biopsies.</p>



<h4 id="h-2-performance-across-skin-types"><strong>2. Performance Across Skin Types</strong></h4>



<p>Interestingly, a sub-analysis presented results according to six skin phototypes defined by the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/fitzpatrick-skin-types">Fitzpatrick scale</a>. The AI technology maintained strong and consistent performance across all skin types, detecting 92-96% of skin cancers in patients with very light to very dark complexions. This suggests DermaSensor can be an effective skin cancer screening tool for all populations regardless of skin pigmentation.</p>



<h4 id="h-3-improving-physician-diagnostic-rates"><strong>3. Improving Physician Diagnostic Rates</strong></h4>



<p>In a related study, 108 physicians evaluated their clinical abilities with and without using DermaSensor. By providing an objective ‘second opinion’, the device helped reduce the doctors’ rate of missed skin cancers from 18% down to just 9%. This indicates it can help physicians make more informed decisions to improve patient care outcomes.</p>



<h3 id="h-benefits-of-dermasensor-for-providers-and-patients"><strong>Benefits of DermaSensor for Providers and Patients</strong></h3>



<h4 id="h-1-expanding-access-to-screening"><strong>1. Expanding Access to Screening</strong></h4>



<p>If approved for widespread use, DermaSensor has the potential to revolutionize skin cancer screening practices in several ways. As the first FDA-cleared device that can evaluate all three major skin cancer types, it allows primary care physicians (PCPs) to monitor high-risk patients more comprehensively during routine exams.</p>



<p>This is significant because PCPs see most patients but often lack speciality dermatology training. DermaSensor may help address this unmet need by giving doctors an easy-to-use AI assistant. </p>



<h4 id="h-2-enhancing-primary-care-capabilities"><strong>2. Enhancing Primary Care Capabilities</strong></h4>



<p>DermaSensor gives PCPs an automated “second opinion” on lesions to boost diagnostic confidence. It could reduce reliance on subjective visual assessment alone. This may lead to more skin cancers being caught at early, highly curable stages before becoming life-threatening. Regular monitoring with an objective AI tool like this may prove pivotal for reducing mortality rates from melanoma and other aggressive skin cancers.</p>



<p>Overall, by aiding the screening abilities of primary care providers nationwide, DermaSensor has the promise to expand access to quality skin cancer detection services significantly – ultimately helping more Americans to benefit from prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of these common malignancies. </p>

<h4 id="h-3-improving-patient-experience"><strong>3. Improving Patient Experience</strong></h4>



<p>For patients, DermaSensor offers a faster, less invasive screening method compared to traditional diagnostic methods like biopsies, which involve surgically removing skin samples for analysis. This spares individuals unnecessary medical procedures if their suspicious lesions are deemed low risk by the AI technology. It could also facilitate improved long-term skin cancer monitoring by enabling “arrive and scan” screenings during regular checkup visits versus scheduling separate dermatology appointments.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-roundup-january-16-2024">Note: Official Announcement by FDA</a></strong></p>



<p>On Friday, the FDA authorized for marketing the DermaSensor Inc. DermaSensor device. It is a prescription device, indicated for the evaluation of skin lesions suggestive of melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and/or squamous cell carcinoma in patients aged 40 and over to assist health care providers in determining whether to refer a patient to a dermatologist. The device should be used in conjunction with the totality of clinically relevant information from the clinical assessment, including visual analysis of the lesion, by physicians who are not dermatologists. The device should be used on lesions already assessed as suspicious for skin cancer and not as a screening tool. The device should not be used as the sole diagnostic criterion nor to confirm a diagnosis of skin cancer. The FDA is requiring that the manufacturer conduct additional post-market clinical validation performance testing of the DermaSensor device in patients from demographic groups representative of the U.S. population, including populations who had limited representation of melanomas in the premarket studies, due to their having a relatively low incidence of the disease</p>
