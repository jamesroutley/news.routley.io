<p><b>A few warnings:</b></p>
<ul>
<li> This is a 100 to 200 megabyte download, depending on what compression
your browser supports, in case you want to back out now.
</li><li> This is known to work on: 
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a>,

</li><li> This is known <SPAN color="#FF0000">NOT</SPAN> to work on:
Mobile Safari, Microsoft Edge before the Windows 10 Creators Update, Internet Explorer.
</li><li> This is just the intro flyby to show it works. The whole game is not
included because it&#39;s a big download and not mine to give out.
</li><li> Since there are files missing, the main menu crashes if you try to
start a game. This is known.
</li><li> The framerate could be much better with a rewritten renderer, but
right now it&#39;s using the original fixed-function OpenGL code here.
</li><li> This was built with

</li><li> This wasn&#39;t done by Epic Games, and no one is selling/shipping/supporting this.
It was just for fun. Don&#39;t bother Epic about it.

free-to-play open source? Check that out
