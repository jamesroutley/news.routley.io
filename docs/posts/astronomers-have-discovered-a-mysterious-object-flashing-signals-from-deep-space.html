<p>Astronomers have discovered a mysterious object flashing strange signals from deep space, and they have no idea what it is.</p><p>The object, named ASKAP J1832-0911, spits out pulses of radio waves and X-rays for two minutes straight, once every 44 minutes.</p><p>Detected by Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/nasa" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/nasa">NASA</a>&#39;s Chandra X-ray observatory, the strange repeating signals are currently unexplained — and unravelling this cosmic mystery could reveal new physics, according to the researchers who discovered it. The team published their findings May 28 in the journal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09077-w-" target="_blank" data-url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09077-w-" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>Nature</u></a>.</p><p>&#34;This object is unlike anything we have seen before,&#34; lead study author <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/andy-wang-57bc8acd/" target="_blank" data-url="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/andy-wang-57bc8acd/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>Andy Wang</u></a>, an astronomer at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1085338" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1085338" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>said in a statement</u></a>. &#34;ASKAP J1831-0911 could be a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/extreme-zombie-star-capable-of-ripping-human-atoms-apart-is-shooting-through-the-milky-way-and-nobody-knows-where-it-came-from" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/extreme-zombie-star-capable-of-ripping-human-atoms-apart-is-shooting-through-the-milky-way-and-nobody-knows-where-it-came-from"><u>magnetar</u></a> (the core of a dead star with powerful magnetic fields), or it could be a pair of stars in a binary system where one of the two is a highly magnetised white dwarf (a low-mass star at the end of its evolution).&#34;</p><p>&#34;However, even those theories do not fully explain what we are observing,&#34; Wang added. &#34;This discovery could indicate a new type of physics or new models of stellar evolution.&#34;</p><p>ASKAP J1832-0911 is a long-period transient (LPT), a class of rare and extreme astrophysical events that sweep out beams of radio waves like cosmic lighthouses. First discovered in 2022, thus far ten LPTs have been catalogued by astronomers.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/cosmic-cannonballs-exploding-out-of-dead-star-could-explain-mysterious-flicker-in-the-night-sky" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/cosmic-cannonballs-exploding-out-of-dead-star-could-explain-mysterious-flicker-in-the-night-sky"><u><strong>&#39;Cosmic cannonballs&#39; exploding out of dead star could explain mysterious flicker in the night sky</strong></u></a></p><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-M62AdnMmJKZS5oMCmQAfGE"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.</p></section></div></div></div><p>Unlike traditional pulsars, which are produced by neutron stars and spit out radio signals every few seconds or milliseconds, LPTs emit pulses at intervals of minutes or hours apart — a period previously thought to be impossible. This has made the cause of the signals, and how they are able to switch on and off at long and regular intervals, a mystery among astronomers.</p><p>After discovering the signals using the ASKAP telescope, the researchers turned to the Chandra X-ray observatory (which was coincidentally pointing at the same patch of sky) to double check what they had found. Chandra&#39;s observations confirmed ASKAP J1832-0911&#39;s presence, while also making the first-ever detection of an LPT in X-rays.</p><p>&#34;Discovering that ASKAP J1832-0911 was emitting X-rays felt like finding a needle in a haystack,&#34; Wang said. &#34;The ASKAP radio telescope has a wide field view of the night sky, while Chandra observes only a fraction of it. So, it was fortunate that Chandra observed the same area of the night sky at the same time.&#34;</p><p>The astronomers believe that the detection of an LPT emitting radio waves and X-rays simultaneously could offer them a valuable clue as to what&#39;s producing them, as any theory that explains the object must now account for both types of emission.</p><p>To assemble more of the puzzle, the researchers suggest that more detections using radio and X-ray telescope pairs should be made.</p><p>&#34;Finding one such object hints at the existence of many more,&#34; second author <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2177-6388" target="_blank" data-url="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2177-6388" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>Nanda Rea</u></a>, an astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute for Space Studies in Spain, said in the statement. &#34;The discovery of its transient X-ray emission opens fresh insights into their mysterious nature.&#34;</p>
