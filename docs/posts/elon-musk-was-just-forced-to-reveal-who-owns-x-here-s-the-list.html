    <h1>Elon Musk was just forced to reveal who owns X. Here&#39;s the list</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Bill Ackman and Sean “Diddy” Combs are among the list of owners of Elon Musk’s <a href="https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/twitter/">X</a>, the social media site <a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/14/x-ordered-to-pay-550000-to-irish-employee-fired-for-not-replying-to-elon-musk-yes-or-resign-extremely-hardcore-ultimatum/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/14/x-ordered-to-pay-550000-to-irish-employee-fired-for-not-replying-to-elon-musk-yes-or-resign-extremely-hardcore-ultimatum/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">formerly known as Twitter</a>.</p><div>



<p>The platform has been <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/21/elon-musk-x-twitter-must-disclose-full-ownership-structure-judge-rules/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/21/elon-musk-x-twitter-must-disclose-full-ownership-structure-judge-rules/">forced to disclose its investors</a> as <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/20/elon-musk-litigation-lawsuits-x-spacex-tesla-legal-federal-court/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/20/elon-musk-litigation-lawsuits-x-spacex-tesla-legal-federal-court/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">part of a lawsuit brought by former employees</a>, who are seeking payment of arbitration fees incurred following <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/15/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sale-twitter-x-advertiser-boycott-finances-bradford-ferguson/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/15/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sale-twitter-x-advertiser-boycott-finances-bradford-ferguson/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">Musk’s purchase of the site</a>. </p>



<p>Previously, X has argued that its investors were confidential as a matter of “routine practice and policy,” but this week, a federal judge in California ruled to unseal the list of the site’s owners.</p>



<p>Among the nearly 100 owners of the social media giant are some familiar names, both from the world of investment and within the X universe.</p>



<p>Previously, <span>high-profile investors like Fidelity have been connected with X, most notably because <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/02/elon-musk-twitter-value-72-percent-drop-fidelity/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/01/02/elon-musk-twitter-value-72-percent-drop-fidelity/" rel="noopener">the investment vehicle’s filings implied a 72% drop in the company’s value</a></span> since Musk took it over.</p>



<p>However, the latest filing reveals the investment behemoth’s backing of the platform, with almost 30 separate Fidelity-linked entities holding stakes in the brand.</p>



<p>This week’s unsealed documents also lay bare the lesser-known stakeholders in the company. </p>



<p><span>The list seen by <em>Fortune</em> reveals the Pershing Square Foundation owns a stake in X. </span>If the name sounds familiar, that’s because of its link to Pershing Square Holdings, founded by billionaire investor Bill Ackman 20 years ago.</p>



<p><span>Although the foundation of the same name is led by an independent senior leadership team, Ackman and his wife, Neri Oxman, <a href="https://pershingsquarefoundation.org/about-us/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://pershingsquarefoundation.org/about-us/" rel="noopener">are</a></span><a href="https://pershingsquarefoundation.org/about-us/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://pershingsquarefoundation.org/about-us/" rel="noopener"> co-trustees</a>.</p>



<p>Ackman is a vocal user of X and frequently uses the platform to address other <span>high-profile individuals and entities. He has used it to <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/05/mark-cuban-elon-musk-bill-ackman-tesla-twitter-dei-mavericks/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/01/05/mark-cuban-elon-musk-bill-ackman-tesla-twitter-dei-mavericks/" rel="noopener">debate <em>Shark Tank</em> star Mark Cuban</a> and raise<a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/11/bill-ackman-larry-summers-harvard-critics-student-israel-statement-palestine-solidarity-committee-psc/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/10/11/bill-ackman-larry-summers-harvard-critics-student-israel-statement-palestine-solidarity-committee-psc/" rel="noopener"> questions about the leadership of his alma mater, Harvard University</a></span>.</p>



<p>Elsewhere on the list of owners is <a href="https://fortune.com/company/oracle/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/oracle/">Oracle</a> founder Larry Ellison. <span>The stake in X comes via the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust, the principal business of which, per an SEC report filed in 2008 and seen by <em>Fortune</em>, is to “hold the assets and estate of Mr. Ellison.”</span></p>



<p>The interests of the trust and Oracle bear no relation to each other, the SEC filing adds. </p>



<p>Unlike Ackman, Ellison is not an avid user of the site. Despite having more than 130,000 followers, Ellison has posted twice—once in 2012 and once in 2023.</p>



<p>Another notable name on the list is Sean Combs Capital. </p>



<p>While SEC filings show no matches for the company, the business has previously been linked to the American rapper Diddy—previously known as Puff Daddy—who has launched a number of businesses under his birth name.</p>



<p>These have included the Sean Combs Foundation, Combs Investments, and more recently the umbrella brand for his holdings, Combs Global.</p>



<p>Musk has also managed to attract some royal attention for his endeavor, with HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud also featured on the list. </p>



<p>The Saudi prince has a net worth just shy of $19 billion, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-alsaud/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.forbes.com/profile/prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-alsaud/" rel="noopener">per </a><em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-alsaud/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.forbes.com/profile/prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-alsaud/" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>,</em> and also has holdings in the likes of luxury hotels the Four Seasons and the Savoy, as well as other technology firms like ride-sharing company <a href="https://fortune.com/company/lyft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/lyft/">Lyft</a>.</p>



<p>It also seems that despite his criticism of Musk’s leadership, Jack Dorsey still owns shares in the platform he founded via the Jack Dorsey Remainder LLC.</p>



<p>The Twitter cofounder previously backed the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/tesla/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/tesla/">Tesla</a> CEO in his takeover of the company but <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/29/elon-musk-twitter-jack-dorsey-criticism/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/04/29/elon-musk-twitter-jack-dorsey-criticism/">walked </a><span><a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/29/elon-musk-twitter-jack-dorsey-criticism/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/04/29/elon-musk-twitter-jack-dorsey-criticism/" rel="noopener">back his support earlier this year</a>, telling a member on rival social media platform Bluesky, “It</span> all went south.”</p>



<h2>Doubling down on investments</h2>



<p>Among the less eminent names are some organizations that not only hold stakes in X as a business but have also seen senior leaders pitch in.</p>



<p>Take the likes of Danilo Kawasaki and Ross Gerber. </p>



<p>According to the filing, the pair are named as individual investors in X but also have a stake in the business they lead, the wealth and investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki.</p>



<p>Elsewhere on the list are the Silicon Valley VCs one might expect: 8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia.</p>



<p>The list, of course, also features Musk himself. Via the Elon Musk Revocable Trust, the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/spacex/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/spacex/">SpaceX</a> founder is also listed.</p>



<p>Musk purchased the site for $44 billion in 2022, though the <span>filing did not make clear the proportion of his investment versus that of others. Since then, the business has been <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/elon-musk-declares-war-on-advertisers-lawsuit-x-boycott/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/elon-musk-declares-war-on-advertisers-lawsuit-x-boycott/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" rel="noopener">beleaguered by departing advertisers</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/11/07/elon-musk-learn-stripe-layoffs-twitter-patrick-collison/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2022/11/07/elon-musk-learn-stripe-layoffs-twitter-patrick-collison/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" rel="noopener">mass layoffs,</a></span> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/30/elon-musk-x-linda-yaccarino-twitter-advertisers-free-speech-dealbook/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/30/elon-musk-x-linda-yaccarino-twitter-advertisers-free-speech-dealbook/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">criticism of Musk’s strategy.</a></p>
