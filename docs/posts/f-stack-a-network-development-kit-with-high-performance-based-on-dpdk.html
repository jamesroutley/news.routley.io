                                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                <p>With the rapid development of NIC, the poor performance of data packets processing with Linux kernel has become the bottleneck. However, the rapid development of the Internet needs high performance of network processing, kernel bypass has caught more and more attention. There are various similar technologies appear, such as DPDK, NETMAP and PF_RING. The main idea of kernel bypass is that Linux is only used to deal with control flow, all data streams are processed in user space. Therefore, kernel bypass can avoid performance bottlenecks caused by kernel packet copy, thread scheduling, system calls and interrupt. Furthermore, kernel bypass can achieve higher performance with multi optimizing methods. Within various techniques, DPDK has been widely used because of its more thorough isolation from kernel scheduling and active community support.</p>
                                <p>F-Stack is an open source network framework with high performance based on DPDK， include an user space TCP/IP stack(port FreeBSD 11.0 stable), Posix API(Socket, Epoll, Kqueue), Progamming SDK(Coroutine) and some apps(Nginx, Redis) interface.</p>
