    <h1>I Fear for the Unauthenticated Web</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>LLM and AI companies seem to all be in a race to
<a href="https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html">breathe the last breath of air</a> in every room
they stumble into. This practice started with larger
websites, ones that already had protection from
malicious usage like denial-of-service and abuse in the form
of services like Cloudflare or Fastly.</p>

<p>But the list of targets has been getting longer.
At this point we&#39;re seeing LLM and AI scrapers
<a href="https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/">targeting small project forges</a> like the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME">GNOME GitLab server</a>.</p>

<p>How long until scrapers start hammering Mastodon servers? Individual websites?
Are we going to have to require authentication or JavaScript challenges on
every web page from here on out?</p>

<p>All this for what, shitty chat bots? What an awful thing that these companies are
doing to the web.</p>

<p>I suggest everyone that uses cloud infrastructure for hosting set-up
a billing limit to avoid an unexpected bill in case they&#39;re
caught in the cross-hairs of a negligent company.
All the abusers anonymize their usage at this point, so good luck trying to
get compensated for damages.</p>
