      <span>Abstract:</span>  In data from the Kepler mission, the normal F3V star KIC 8462852 (Boyajian&#39;s
star) was observed to exhibit infrequent dips in brightness that have not been
satisfactorily explained. A previous paper reported the first results of a
search for other similar stars in a limited region of the sky around the Kepler
field. This paper expands on that search to cover the entire sky between
declinations of +22 degrees and +68 degrees. Fifteen new candidates with low
rates of dipping, referred to as &#34;slow dippers&#34; in Paper I, have been
identified. The dippers occupy a limited region of the HR diagram and an
apparent clustering in space is found. This latter feature suggests that these
stars are attractive targets for SETI searches.
