    <h1>The work is never just “the work” (2022)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A deep dive on why projects always overrun and a framework to improve future estimation</p><div><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2> <p>If you’re like me, you’re maybe a jobbing dev taking on contracts and occasionally your own gigs (and by-and-large this works out OK) but <em>maybe</em> you secretly hate yourself for being <strong>terrible</strong> at estimation, and wish you were better at it.</p> <p>If that sounds like you, read on!</p> <h2 id="background">Background</h2> <p>Last year I took on what seemed like a short, easy-to-deliver project, which over the course of a year turned into the kind of “night of the living dead” slog and because of a variety of factors has <em>never</em> been easy to estimate.</p> <p>With the latest phase finally delivered, I wanted to conduct a detailed postmortem to understand why my perception of the <em>actual</em> work was so off, and in the process reevaluate everything I know about assumptions and estimation.</p> <p>In the rest of the article I’ll deep dive my own shortcomings around estimation, as well as present a framework to plan and visualise estimates, hopefully helping both of us clear those lurking feelings of confusion and guilt.</p> <!----> <h2 id="why-is-estimating-hard">Why is estimating hard?</h2> <p>Estimating is hard because you can’t predict the future.</p> <p>Some of the strategies I’ve heard or have tried:</p> <ul><li><p><em><strong>Add on 30% for project management.</strong></em> </p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Double or triple your estimate</strong></em> </p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Double it, then double it again (4x-it)</strong></em> </p></li></ul> <p>Note that in the above points I was careful to avoid using the word “overrun”.</p> <p>Overrun implies that the estimate was <strong>sound</strong> and it was the <em>execution</em> that was not. However, we know this is generally <strong>not</strong> the case; you don’t take on work just to do <strong>more</strong>, so the <strong>real</strong> problem is being unable to predict what you will need to do, and how long it will take you to do it.</p> <h2 id="breaking-it-down">Breaking it down</h2> <p>To uncover my estimation blind spots, I set out to dissect the previous months’ effort with clear and unbiased honesty.</p> <p>I aimed to:</p> <ul><li>review the work completed and contrast it to original estimates</li> <li>root out failings in areas such as planning, skills, communication, etc</li> <li>dig into the mental and technical incongruity between plan and eventuality</li> <li>ponder previous projects and compare previous failings</li> <li>identify generic patterns I could apply to future situations</li></ul> <p>I reviewed the project’s notes, files and code, mentally reliving the process of working on each, documenting what I remembered. Whilst recalling the overall thrust of each unit of work, I attempted to keep my observations generic – so specifics around a particular technology for example – wouldn’t muddy the underlying causes for any overrun.</p> <p>Building on my notes, I shared the observations on <a href="https://twitter.com/dave_stewart/status/1471112458341335041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a> and encouraged others to comment:</p> <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/davestewart/643ffc55aa7c173618d2707b776a1443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://davestewart.co.uk/assets/img/gist-screenshot.bc6ba8cd.png" alt="gist screenshot"/><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a></p> <p>Do click and have a read though; there’s lots of interesting recollections and observations. I’m sure you’ll be nodding along and thinking “yeah, that’s got me before too!”.</p> <h2 id="reviewing-the-findings">Reviewing the findings</h2> <p>The first major takeaway was that the actual process of <strong>writing the postmortem</strong> was extremely valuable.</p> <p>I had been aware during the project that there seemed to be a lot of “extra work”, but putting it down on paper highlighted the multitude of “invisible” tasks and challenges which every web development project has.</p> <p>There were two common threads:</p> <ul><li>much of the work was the “work to do the work” rather than the “actual” work</li> <li>most of the work was under- or un-estimated because it wasn’t the “actual” work</li></ul> <p><em><strong>This was in equal parts both <strong>shocking</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>enlightening</strong>.</strong></em></p> <p>I couldn’t believe I had been so blind to this, up until now:</p> <ul><li>perhaps I considered this unplanned work as just something you have to do?</li> <li>perhaps I thought my attention-to-detail style was somehow my cross to bear?</li></ul> <p>Reflecting on this, I think most likely it’s a mix of misplaced professional pride and a level of cognitive dissonance around how quickly I think professional work <em>should</em> be completed, rather than how long it takes to actually complete; I was effectively <em>ignoring</em> the additional time because “it didn’t feel correct”.</p> <p>An analogy that sprang to mind was that of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dark+matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dark matter<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>; it’s invisible (like much of a project’s work) but by its gravitational influence, scientists know it makes up the majority of the mass of the universe.</p> <p>But dark matter aside, the upshot is that this effort – my effort – was not being considered, estimated or paid for!</p> <h2 id="building-it-back-up">Building it back up</h2> <p>It was clear that this “happy path” thinking was not only costly in financial terms, but probably explained the various issues I’ve had with over-running or over-working over the years – at either mine or sometimes my client’s expense.</p> <p>And though the observations themselves felt extremely valuable, they needed fleshing out and pulling together.</p> <p>Moving forwards, I wanted to:</p> <ul><li>start thinking about some kind of “framework” to fit them in or around</li> <li>use them as building blocks to break down any future work, maybe even adding timings</li> <li>shine a light on the overall structure and nature of projects, and their estimation</li></ul> <p>The distinction of the work “before / between / around” the work felt like the beginnings of said framework, and I eventually settled on:</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Analogy</th> <th>Real world</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><span></span> The work around the work</td> <td><em><strong>Admin</strong></em></td></tr> <tr><td><span></span> The work to get the work</td> <td><em><strong>Acquisition</strong></em></td></tr> <tr><td><span></span> The work before the work</td> <td><em><strong>Preparation</strong></em></td></tr> <tr><td><span></span> The work</td> <td><em><strong>Execution</strong></em></td></tr> <tr><td><span></span> The work between the work</td> <td><em><strong>Iteration</strong></em></td></tr> <tr><td><span></span> The work beyond the work</td> <td><em><strong>Changes</strong></em></td></tr> <tr><td><span></span> The work outside the work</td> <td><em><strong>Problems</strong></em></td></tr> <tr><td><span></span> The work after the work</td> <td><em><strong>Support</strong></em></td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Whilst the above analogies roughly align with real world project phases, reframing the effort in such an abstract manner felt helpful in decoupling the true nature of the work from my idealised optimism.</p> <h2 id="visualisation">Visualisation</h2> <p>During this investigation, I had begun to wonder if I could represent the findings <strong>graphically</strong>.</p> <p>The following graphic is <strong>not</strong> an accurate representation of the work, or to scale regarding the work there was to do, but is an initial attempt to view “the work” compared to the <strong>overall</strong> scope of an entire project lifecycle:</p> <p><img src="https://davestewart.co.uk/assets/img/estimation.5de326c1.png" alt="infographic showing how a development project&#39;s phases can be broken down and estimated"/></p> <p>When I designed the graphic, I didn’t really have in my head how much effort each square represented, but in hindsight for a small or medium project, it could be a day. Each line could be a week, with the smaller grey dots as weekly meetings, and the smaller green dots evenings and weekends.</p> <p>But again, this isn’t scientific, more a “finger in the air” visualisation.</p> <p>Also, as someone <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36150105#36162646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a> on Hacker News, it’s worth remembering that a day is rarely 8 full-hours of work!

here are just a few:</p> <ul><li>could work be represented proportionally; that is, more complex tasks as bigger squares?</li> <li>could some kind of checklist help create charts which <em>actually</em> could help with estimation?</li> <li>could there be a formula for the “work between the work”?</li> <li>could multiple charts represent cumulative effort by UX, Design and Development?</li> <li>how would the shape of charts vary between project, discipline or person?</li></ul> <p>There are also myriad considerations and constraints regarding the <em>mechanics</em> of project management such as project size, duration, phase and maturity, or team size, experience, optimism or biases.</p> <p>Whilst I would love to spend more time on this, for now it will have to remain a thought experiment!</p> <h3 id="on-estimation">On estimation</h3> <p>As I’ve mentioned various times throughout this article, I’ve certainly taken some artistic and numerical license.</p> <p>However, the aim of this exercise was to get to grips with the distortion field around accurately estimating projects when our brains are wired to ignore the detail – and there is <em>so much</em> detail.</p> <p>Yes, there are estimation frameworks such as T-shirt Sizes, Planning Poker and we are all used to Agile, but the problem remains to be solved – as humans and developers, how can we take responsibility for more accurately gauging the work “between”, “beyond” and “outside” “the work”?</p> <h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2> <p>The key takeaway is that even a detailed estimate of “the work” can miss significant “invisible” work.</p> <p>Without a proper audit it is impossible to properly quantify how long work takes over the longer term, but given the breakdowns above “double it and double it again” doesn’t seem so farfetched; at the very least it makes a good first marker to sanity-check your next estimation, be it a sprint or a project.</p> <p>Some strategies and thoughts going forward:</p> <ul><li>Run postmortems on past projects to anchor yourself to reality</li> <li>Consider timing and logging future work to equip yourself for the future</li> <li>Get familiar with, and work to improve, your own estimation biases and weak spots</li> <li>Remember every project <em>will</em> have <em>most</em> of these invisible “work” types</li> <li>If you end up in trouble, prefer “raising a hand” to “doubling down”</li> <li>Beware fixed-price projects!</li></ul> <p>You may also want to check the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36150105#36159318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacker News thread<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a> which picked up this article;
