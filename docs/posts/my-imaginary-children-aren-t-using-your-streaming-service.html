    <h1>My imaginary children aren&#39;t using your streaming service</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody"><p>Whenever I start up Netflix, I&#39;m asked if I want to create an account for my children.</p>

<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Who-is-watching-Netflix.jpg.webp" alt="Screen asking &#34;Who is watching Netflix&#34; with a forced children option." width="800" height="600"/></p><p>I don&#39;t have children. I don&#39;t want children. I find most children annoying - not yours, obviously, yours are lovely. But I resent being asked <em>every single time</em> whether my imaginary kids want an account. It&#39;s just annoying.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine what it is like for bereaved parents who have recently lost a child. Or for those struggling with fertility issues. That constant reminder every time they try to numb the pain with a sitcom.</p>

<p>For some reason, all the streaming services are <em>desperate</em> for me to add accounts for my (imaginary) children. Are they worried about being sued if little Jimothy accidentally hears a swear word?  Thankfully, Netflix lets you delete this imaginary child.</p>

<p>The BBC&#39;s iPlayer is less enlightened. They recently forced an &#34;add child account&#34; setting to the front page.  It is impossible to remove it.</p>



<p>Apparently, it is technically impossible to remove an option which has recently appeared.</p>

<p>Amazon Prime has the same forced default child-profile. Although, thankfully, they allow you to remove it with a couple of clicks.</p>

<p>Channel 4 goes a step further. Any time I want to watch anything with sex, drugs, or violence - I have to confirm that I don&#39;t want to set up a parental lock.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Channel-4-Player.jpg.webp" alt="Channel 4 Player asking me to confirm if I&#39;m over 18." width="800" height="600"/></p><p>There&#39;s no way that I can find to dismiss the screen. That&#39;s an extra click for my RSI-ridden hands every time I want to watch a stupid game show.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing.  <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/bulletins/familiesandhouseholds/2019">The majority of households in the UK don&#39;t have kids</a>.</p>

<blockquote>  <p>London contained the highest proportion of families with dependent children in 2019; accounting for half of all families in London, compared with the UK average of 42.0%.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s this weird belief that everything needs to be made safe for children. Even if no children are present, we have to protect them. That has led to some <em>weird</em> antipatterns.</p>

<p>Frankly, if a child somehow makes it into my home, and is left unsupervised long enough to work out which of the 7 remote controls turns on the TV and surround sound system, and figures out how to access Netflix - I&#39;d say they&#39;re mature enough to watch whatever they want.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-solution"><a href="#whats-the-solution">What&#39;s the solution?</a></h2>

<p>I get that making your UI easy for harried parents is a priority.  They&#39;re a big market - and they can be vocal about any perceived harm to their little ones. But there&#39;s no reason to <em>keep</em> showing the option if someone doesn&#39;t engage with it.  You can ask if a child profile is necessary during set up. If you have a pop-up asking if a user wants a child-friendly account, make sure it has a &#34;never ask me again&#34; option.</p>

<p>The world doesn&#39;t revolve around children. It&#39;s OK to let people who don&#39;t have kids use your services without frustration.</p>
