    <div><p>November is usually a settled month with little bird movement, following the busy autumn migration period. This year hasn’t been a typical year though, with migration going on later than usual.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  <div itemprop="articleBody">
          <div><div><p>This meant that November saw the arrival of some of our winter visitors which would usually be here from October, as well as some later-than-usual departures.</p>
<p>The highlight of the month came on the 4<sup>th</sup>. Firstly, early in the morning two <strong>little egrets</strong> passed over, this species has been uncommon here this year, which is surprising considering that they breed only a couple of miles away at Walthamstow. Even more unusually, at lunchtime on the same day, we had a flyover <strong>great white egret</strong>. This was the third visit of the year by this former London rarity.</p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>The first returning <strong>common gull (above with black-headed gull)</strong> usually arrives in early October, but this year we had to wait until November 3<sup>rd</sup>. Numbers increased for the rest of the month, reaching around 25 by the end of the month. Wildfowl movement was also late. The <strong>shoveler</strong> flock which usually dwindles to single figures by the end of the October still numbered around fifty by that time this year. Numbers dropped through November but were still about ten by the end of the month. <strong>Teal (below)</strong> didn’t appear until the 24<sup>th</sup> when four birds arrived.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>Towards the end of November the reservoir water level dropped significantly, leading to muddy fringes forming around the edges of the reed-bed. Sightings of mud-loving birds increased during this time. A <strong>little egret</strong> became a daily visitor, and <strong>snipe</strong> started to be easier to see, with the highest count for the month being eight.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>Sightings of <strong>kingfisher (above)</strong> also increased at the end of November, with one bird finding a very regular perch along the channel between the reed-bed and the nearest island to the boardwalk.</p>
<p>A <strong>buzzard</strong> passed over southbound on the 19<sup>th</sup>, as usual with an entourage of the local crows. Other flyover highlights were a few late <strong>meadow pipits</strong> and fairly regular winter thrushes.</p>
<p>The total number of bird species seen here in November 2023 was 57, a figure about three lower than the average from the previous five years.</p>
