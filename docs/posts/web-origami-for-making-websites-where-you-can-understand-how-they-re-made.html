    <h1>Web Origami, for making websites where you can understand how they’re made</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>Origami is a new programming language that complements HTML and CSS for making small- to medium-scale websites.</p>
<p><strong>Everybody has something to say,</strong> and the web is a great place to say it, but creating interesting sites can be hard or expensive. Standard HTML and CSS let you define individual pages, but it’s hard to efficiently create a bunch of pages and organize them into a coherent site.</p>
<p>Corporate site hosting services offer nice drag-and-drop editors but impose creative limitations and high monthly costs. You could build something from scratch — if you master a full programming language like JavaScript and a pile of industrial development tools. The web needs better ways to create sizable, expressive sites at low cost and without entanglements.</p>
<p>Origami is designed for you: someone who wants to make a site for yourself or a small organization, who can HTML and CSS, who’s not a professional developer — or is, but wants to build sites more quickly. Someone who wants to understand how their site actually gets made.</p>
<p>The core idea is to describe the site you want at a high level as concisely as possible. If you can sketch your site like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://liquidbrain.net/assets/illustrations/Site%20Sketch.svg"/>
</figure>

<p>then you can turn that into a small Origami program that orchestrates the creation of your site:</p>
<pre><code>{
  
  <span>assets</span>

  
  <span>index.html</span> <span>=</span> <span>index.ori</span>(<span>products.yaml</span>)

  
  <span>products</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span>(<span>products.yaml</span>, <span>products.ori</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>Origami lets you describe how you want to transform your data and files into HTML and the other resources for your site. You can create many things without complex programming: a full-text search feature, RSS feeds for blogs, and so on. You don’t need to know JavaScript, but if you do, you can use it to easily extend what you can do in Origami.</p>
<p>A high-level site definition is enough to let you immediately view and iterate on your site without complex build tools. When you’re ready to publish, Origami turns your site into a collection of plain files you can deploy wherever you want, often for free.</p>

<p>Web Origami takes its name from the traditional paper folding art of origami, in which you can transform a flat square of paper into an artwork.</p>

<p>The steps may be simple but the end result can be complex and beautiful. In the same way, Origami lets you transform your content into something to share.</p>
<h2 id="aspects">Aspects</h2>
<p>The project includes several separate but interoperable tools and ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://liquidbrain.net/language/">Origami language</a> lets you concisely define a website or other structured using formulas similar to those in a spreadsheet.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://liquidbrain.net/cli/">ori command-line interface</a> (CLI) lets you use Origami expressions in a command terminal to manipulate files or get resources out of an Origami website in the command line. The CLI is also useful as a general tool in its own right for working with JavaScript in the shell.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://liquidbrain.net/builtins/">built-in functions</a> let you perform a number of common website development tasks in the Origami language.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://liquidbrain.net/async-tree/">async-tree library</a> lets JavaScript programmers use core Origami features in JavaScript applications.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://liquidbrain.net/pattern/">conceptual pattern</a> at the foundation of it all lets you represent a wide variety of data types as trees that can be easily traversed and transformed. There’s no code at this level; you can use the ideas in any project.</li>
</ul>
