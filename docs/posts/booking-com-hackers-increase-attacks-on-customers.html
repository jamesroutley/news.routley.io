Instead the link downloads malware on to staff computers and automatically searches the hotel computers for Booking.com access.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Then the hackers log into the Booking.com portal allowing them to see all customers who currently have room or holiday reservations. The hackers then message customers from the official app and are able to trick people into paying money to them instead of the hotel.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Hackers appear to be making so much money in their attacks that they are now offering to pay thousands to criminals who share access to hotel portals.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The scam is working and it&#39;s paying serious dividends,&#34; says Rafe Pilling, director of threat intelligence for Secureworks Counter Threat Unit.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The demand for credentials is likely so popular because it&#39;s seeing a high success rate, with emails targeting genuine customers and appearing to come from a trusted source. It&#39;s social engineering at its best,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Lucy Buckley was contacted through the Booking.com app in September by hackers using broken English, who convinced her to send them £200. She says they pretended to staff at the Paris hotel where she had booked a room, saying that she must pay the money or her reservation would be lost.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After she sent the money, the real hotel staff informed her they had no knowledge of the payment. Acting quickly, she managed to get a refund from her bank, which revealed her money had been sent to an account in Moldova.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A Booking.com spokesman said: &#34;While this breach was not on Booking.com, we understand the seriousness for those impacted, which is why our teams work diligently to support our partners in securing their systems as quickly as possible and helping any potentially impacted customers accordingly, including with recovering any lost funds.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Cyber-security expert and podcaster Graham Cluley was also nearly tricked into sending money to hackers.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He says Booking.com hotels should implement multi-factor authentication to make it harder for criminals to log in illegally.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Booking.com has started displaying a warning message on the bottom of chat windows, but they could be doing much more than this. For instance, not allowing any links to be included in chat which go to websites that are less than a few days old would prevent freshly-made fake sites being used to trick customers into paying,&#34; he said.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>Are you affected by the issues raised in this story?
