    <h1>Blue Prince (1989)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 1989, I turned nine.  For my birthday, my dad got me a copy of Blue
Prince for the Apple //e, which had been released earlier that year.
I fell in love with it, spending hours plumbing its secrets. So when
the remake was released this year, I decided to try out the new
version.  On reflection, I think I actually prefer the original.  You
can see a bit of gameplay that I recorded using RetroArch:</p>

A video showing a green-on-black screen, with the distortions typical
of a 1980s CRT. Everything is ASCII-art. First, a Blue Prince
Logo. Then the fountain and &#39;Day 13&#39; and then the manor scrolls into
view. The manor moves to the left of the screen, and the entrance
hall&#39;s text description appears to the right. Next, a drafting screen,
showing how the player would select among the Wine Cellar, Pump Room,
and Drawing Room. The player selects the Pump Room, and, after
showing the description of the room, a diagram of the pump
configuration.

<p>Here are some things I like about the original:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This is a bit of a spoiler, but one puzzle required you to reach an
object on the ceiling of one of the rooms.  To solve it, you had to
take the game’s actual floppy disk out of the drive and put it in
upside-down, which turned the whole room upside down. It’s perhaps the
best lateral-thinking puzzle in any game I’ve ever
played. (Admittedly, I didn’t fully solve it myself – my next-door
neighbor Stephen, who was year or two older, had to give me a hint).
Of course, the 2025 version can’t have that puzzle (well, I guess it
could use a laptop’s accelerometer, but it might be a bit hard to turn
a desktop computer upside-down), and the replacement, which I won’t
spoil, isn’t as good.</p></li>
<li><p>Rooms directly described their contents. So the Security Room’s
feature which tells you what objects you missed was much less
necessary (it’s still there because of spreading, but you only need it
later in the game). Does someone actually enjoy using the metal
detector to hunt around every room for coins, at least after the first
time?</p></li>
<li><p>The game was much quicker to play. Instead of having to wander
around a (beautifully rendered, admittedly) 3d space in order to
explore a room, you could just read a few lines of text, and press an
arrow key.  The keyboard is, of course, <a href="https://danluu.com/keyboard-latency/">wonderfully
responsive</a>. This is my main
complaint with the 2025 remake: why use all of this 3d technology just
to make the game take longer to play?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, if you bounced off the Blue Prince remake because of the slow
pace, do yourself a favor and try the 1989 version.  Once you get used
to the minimalist aesthetic, you might like it better. The floppy-disk
image is available on any of the usual sites, and it can be played on an
Apple emulator.</p>
