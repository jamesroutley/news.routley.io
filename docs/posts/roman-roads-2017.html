<p>It’s finally done. A subway-style diagram of the major Roman roads, based on the Empire of ca. 125 AD.</p>
<p>Creating this required far more research than I had expected—there is not a single consistent source that was particularly good for this. Huge shoutout to: 
  <a href="http://orbis.stanford.edu/">Stanford’s ORBIS model</a>, 
  <a href="http://pelagios.org/maps/greco-roman/">The Pelagios Project</a>, and the Antonine Itinerary (found a full PDF online but lost the url).</p>
<p>The lines are a combination of actual, named roads (like the Via Appia or Via Militaris) as well as roads that do not have a known historic name (in which case I creatively invented some names). Skip to the “Creative liberties taken” section for specifics.</p>
<p>How long would it actually take to travel this network? That depends a lot on what method of transport you are using, which depends on how much money you have. Another big factor is the season – each time of year poses its own challenges. In the summer, it would take you about two months to walk on foot from Rome to Byzantium. If you had a horse, it would only take you a month.</p>
<p>However, no sane Roman would use only roads where sea travel is available. Sailing was much cheaper and faster – a combination of horse and sailboat would get you from Rome to Byzantium in about 25 days, Rome to Carthage in 4-5 days. Check out 
  <a href="http://orbis.stanford.edu/">ORBIS</a> if you want to play around with a “Google Maps” for Ancient Rome. I decided not to include maritime routes on the map for simplicity’s sake.</p>
<h3 id="creative-liberties-taken">Creative liberties taken</h3>
<p>The biggest creative element was choosing which roads and cities to include, and which to exclude. There is no way I could include every Roman road, these are only the main ones. I tried to include cities with larger populations, or cities that were provincial capitals around the 2nd century.</p>
<p>Obviously to travel from Petra to Gaza you would take a more or less direct road, rather than going to Damascus and “transferring” to the Via Maris. The way we travel on roads is very different from rail, which is a slight flaw in the concept of the map. But I think it’s still aesthetically pleasing and informative.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the roads that have authentic names and paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Via Appia</li>
<li>Via Augusta</li>
<li>Via Aurelia</li>
<li>Via Delapidata</li>
<li>Via Domitia</li>
<li>Via Egnatia</li>
<li>Via Flaminia</li>
<li>Via Flavia (I, II, III)</li>
<li>Via Julia Augusta</li>
<li>Via Lusitanorum</li>
<li>Via Militaris</li>
<li>Via Popilia</li>
<li>Via Portumia</li>
<li>Via Salaria</li>
<li>Via Tiburtina</li>
<li>Via Traiana</li>
<li>Via Traiana Nova</li>
</ul>
<p>Some roads have real names but were modified somewhat:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Via Latina I combined with the Via Popilia. In reality the Popilia ended at Capua, and the Latina went from Capua to Rome.</li>
<li>Via Aquitania only referred to the road from Burdigala (Bordeaux) to Narbo (Narbonne).</li>
<li>Via Asturica Burdigalam similarly only refers to the Astrurica-Burdigala section.</li>
<li>“Via Claudia” is not a real name, but refers to a real continuous road built by Claudius.</li>
<li>Via Hadriana was a real road in Egypt, but it refers to a slightly different section than the green route.</li>
<li>The name “Via Maris” is considered to be a modern creation, referring to real ancient trade road whose real name has been lost to history.</li>
<li>Via Valeria only referred to a section of the yellow Sicilian loop.</li>
<li>The roads around Pisae, Luna and Genua had several names for different sections, including <em>Via Aemilia Scauri</em>. Sometimes “Via Aurelia” referred to the entire road from Rome to Arelate.</li>
<li>Via Sucinaria is the Latin name for the Amber Road, a trade route from the Baltic region to Italy that carried amber as a valuable good. It probably was not used to refer to a single literal road.</li>
<li>Via Gemina and Via Claudia Augusta are real names that referred to small parts of the routes marked on the map.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other roads have relatively uncreative names that I invented, usually based on a place that they pass through. I have never formally studied Latin and I’ll admit that I am somewhat confused by the distinction between <em>-a</em> and <em>-ensis</em> endings, so there’s a chance I may have messed that up.</p>
<h2 id="update">Update</h2>
<p>I got numerous comments following the release of my Roman roads map. Acting by the mantra of “OP delivers”, I decided to take this feedback into account and create an updated version of the map. The new map is featured here, and I have also replaced the map in the original post with the new version.</p>
<p>Several changes were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The typo in <em>Gesoriacum</em> is fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Via Agrippa</em> is now properly named. For some reason I had typed <em>Via Flavia</em> by mistake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Via Flavia</em> now refers to the road along the Dalmatian coast, in reference to the actual <em>Via Flavia</em> in what is now Croatia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have included <em>Berytus</em>, present-day Beirut, in the map. It was the capital of Roman Phoenicia and one of the most important cities in the Eastern Mediterranean at the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The town of <em>Vindonissa</em> has been added. It was a prominent fort in what is now Switzerland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The road in Sardinia now goes from <em>Caralis</em> to <em>Tarrae</em>. This was (and still is) the most prominent land linkage on the island.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Road names ending in <em>-ensis</em> have been changed to more classical names:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Via Sarda</em> now uses the proper Latin adjective for the island.</li>
<li><em>Via__Augusta Nova</em> is named after the emperor who established the proconsular government in Asia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other geographically-named roads have had name changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Via Domitiana</em> is named after Domitian, who conquered Moesia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Via Tiberia</em> in Cappadocia is named after Tiberius, who established the province.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The British Isles are now displayed in full, and the British road network has been expanded a tiny bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Lucus</em> (Lugo) is now moved inland, and the road from Bracara Augusta to Asturica has been separated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
