    <div><div><p>This is a collection of ultra-short Thumbnail Nature pieces from a workshop I co-led on 18 December 2021 with Rebecca Gibson, wildlife writer and photographer. Some of these writers have had their work published previously but many were new to creative nature writing. I hope you’ll agree after reading them that there is a vast untapped talent out there.</p></div></div>

          <div><div><h3>From a December garden near Southampton</h3>

<p>Snap, crackle, pop! Twiggy branches trashed by size seven boots which continue scrunching on frost stricken leaves. Wrapping paper over dank, bleak earth, still weighted by late wet and shivering now, under a raw north wind, oblivious to the low, milky sun.</p>

<p><em>Helen Weber. Busy in retirement: budding artist, writer, gardener and lover of all things green; recycling nerd, and Greyhound mum.</em></p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>Rocks, trees and moor muted in tone by moist vaporous overlays, everything greyed out, soft focus. The all pervading dampness has penetrated my boots, chilling toes whose crackling tracks vanish into white. Each breath comes as mist and drifts away, integrating with the atmosphere. Insignificance and oneness blend together.</p>

  <div>
          <div><div><p>Small diamonds of ice clutch to a blade of western wheatgrass, catching light from a mottled December sky. The frond is weighed down by the crystallized burden, but remains buoyant still. Strong, unbreaking, and awaiting the relief of an impending thaw.</p>

          <div><div><p>Snow of hard cold peaks</p>
<p>creeps along granite gullies</p>
<p>slivers of white</p>
<p>lacing edges fray</p>
<p>Transformed in secret evergreen shade</p>
<p>Softer falling</p>
<p>slowly riverwards</p>
<p>to tumble together</p>
<p>excitedly rushing onwards</p>
<p>carrying sharp memories of bitter frozen peaks</p>
<p>I touch the water and am transported</p>
<p>myself involuntarily icy</p>
<p>rigid as rock.</p>

          <div><div><p><strong>PHEASANT</strong></p>
<p>Not ice, just a crust of frost baked mud, rutted with the memory of rain. Warmth forgotten, beaten down by broken bracken, distant snap of dog frozen in the air.</p>
<p>Helmeted green, duck sleek and red eyed, hop-strutting towards us. Wise guy this one; canny enough not to fly.</p>

  <div>
          <div><div><p>A magpie perches on the naked apple tree, searching for grubs hidden</p>
<p>in the tightly folded buds. Its head is no more than a black smudge,</p>
<p>its tail a scribble, its belly already dissolving against the grey</p>
<p>sky. With a raucous caw, it lifts off into the winter’s afternoon.</p>

<p><em>Angi Holden has been writing most of her life, most recently at a desk so covered in leaves and feathers collected by her grandchildren that it resembles a nature table. @josephsyard</em></p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>There&#39;s nothing barren about this bare winter. Cold peacefulness is found in an opal sky, marked by faint cirrus clouds. A brushing of winter feathers. The piercing caw of crow splinters garden silence, demands hierarchy; every branch his throne. Surviving leaves quiver in the aftershock of vibration. Crow grates again.</p>

          <div><div><p><strong>A Wintered Retreat</strong></p>
<p>The birdsong has thinned, harvested by the recent freeze. Only the broken gargle of pheasants now, and murmurings scribed by the bone-bleach breeze. Voices which may not be human. Words unclear. A blackbird startles away, distressed, disappearing into the scant leaves. The rising mist ghosts us all.</p>

<p><em>E. E. Rhodes is an archaeologist who lives in Wales and Wiltshire. She writes a range of prose which is published all over the place.</em></p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>There is no ice this year: the western wind’s too warm. No snowy footprints, either, telling tales of wildness and wonder. Only a soundscape marred by human imprints: distant vehicles, an orchard chainsaw…my presence itself a trespass, met not with birds’ songs, but by their escalating cries: Alarm?... Alarm! …ALARM!!</p>

      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>Water in two forms here: frozen footpath puddles, a languidly flowing river. Willows whisper, footsteps shuffle, cycles shiver past. Gulls overhead evoke summer’s seaside songs, momentarily dispelling winter’s thrall. I am chilled, but my senses are honed. I walk beside the Mersey, slipping on ice and I embrace it all.</p>

<p><em>Based in north-west England, Jennifer Jones writes passionately about soils, birds, and landscapes.</em></p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>Iced breaths wisp away from me in the pre-dawn glimmer. In the distance, the wheezy rattles of crows back a shouty robin. Is there a quiet flutter before I see the incomer? A dunnock - preening in our leafless crab - ticks me off with tail flicks and a sharp alarm.</p>

          <div><div><p>Sun squawks. Winds hush. Tis the season. White lush. Thickets form: billowing towards the sensitive fingertips of year-round members. “Look, mam! Can’t you see the cold shooting up?” “What, dear? See with my eyes?” “No. With your feel.” Young fingertips slot into the aged grasp. “To keep warm,” he explains.</p>

  <div>
          <div><div><p>I walked with my mother on a winter’s night.</p>
<p>Caught in a snowstorm without warning she gripped my hand tightly. I felt her fear creeping.</p>
<p>And a sense of the streets being deserted.</p>
<p>Her silence as loud as the white flakes.</p>
<p>We trudged like distant figures on a Christmas card.</p>

<p>Colour and sound are muted by a frosty layer</p>
<p>Nostrils tighten with cold air</p>
<p>Ears strain for creaks and crunches</p>
<p>Skin pulls taut across cheekbones</p>
<p>The frozen stillness intensifies</p>
<p>Tiny crystals glint, the air sparkles</p>
<p>Snow crumps, revealing a footprint</p>

<p>Balls of root feet</p>
<p>Snug deep in snow</p>

<p>Soft satisfying crunch of my snow boots</p>
<p>Slice through the silence</p>
<p>Behind</p>
<p>I leave soul footprints</p>
<p>Playful breathy vapour ghosts</p>
<p>Floating in the crisp cold air</p>
<p>I was there</p>

<p>My foot crunches the stories of a morning.</p>
<p>Neatly layered hours,</p>
<p>snow on snow,</p>
<p>now compressed into a size 8 pancake of ice.</p>
<p>Who came first? The robin? The deer?</p>
<p>Waterproof boots edit events,</p>
<p>have the last word until…</p>
<p>Snow on snow,</p>
<p>my footprints disappear</p>
<p>under the duvet.</p>

<p>My breath, a foggy mix of warmth and cold.</p>
<p>Sun glistens on snow-clad trees.</p>
<p>Blankets of white against rock and trunk.</p>
<p>Snowdrifts everywhere.</p>
<p>Scattered tracks of fox and field mice.</p>
<p>Blue sky sheds its cloak of clouds.</p>
<p>Beauty and stillness.</p>

<p>I’m the first footprint</p>
<p>Alone but not lonely</p>

Blistering breeze, crackling trees, crumpling leaves all give way to the new dawn. Enlightenment awaits.</p>

<p>The witching hour: Nature raged – wind slashed limbs; rain pelted earth. Blush and</p>
<p>cornflower swept the horizon. The orchards wore crispy white. The slumbering</p>
<p>peach trees adorned with iridescent jewels stood proud. A single court aches for</p>
<p>him. Tangerine kisses the sky – The Sun King returns.</p>

          <div><div><p>Saturnalia and solstice, when nature seems frozen. I live where mid-winter linnets used to lunch. Where do they do this now? In the nearby woodland fruits are desiccated, little creatures hunker down, fungi retreats. But on this still morning leaves tinkle beneath my feet, and I spot a fox’s footprints.</p>

I lay down, bring a soft snow angel to life. The city is quietly transformed, the mundane magical. A wonderland without restriction, accessible to all.</p>

Savouring the smell of frost. Catching snowflakes on your tongue, taste gone in seconds, but never forgotten. Who does not miss their childhood winters?</p>

<p>But it’s not that first icy gulp of air.</p>
<p>Or the chatter of fieldfares plucking berries.</p>
<p>Or the glimmer of aurora over the sea.</p>
<p>It doesn’t line the vein of each leaf with crusted silver.  </p>
<p>It’s not snow, slush, drift, powder, flake or icicle.</p>
<p>It’s not winter.</p>
