<p>Well folks, they’re finally here: after a spate of delays, AMD has unveiled its shiny new laptop processors, the Ryzen 7040U series. Designed to power a new wave of next-generation ultra-thin devices, these chips could take laptop performance to a whole new level - and AMD is clearly feeling confident about it.</p><p>Why do I say this? Well, Team Red isn’t messing about with its promotional material: we’ve got direct comparisons not just to Intel’s competing 13th-gen CPUs, but also Apple’s powerhouse M2 chip.</p><p>AMD doesn’t beat around the bush; the Ryzen 7 7840U, the initial flagship APU of the new series, apparently offers 9% better 3D rendering performance, 14% better responsiveness, and a whopping 72% better multiprocessing performance than the standard M2. That’s the one you’ll find in the latest <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022"><u>MacBook Air</u></a> - we can probably expect the M2 Pro and M2 Max chips found in this year’s <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-2023"><u>MacBook Pro</u></a>.</p><p>Packing up to 8 Zen 4 cores and AMD’s Radeon 780M integrated graphics as well as XDNA AI architecture, these new chips - previously codenamed ‘Phoenix’ - are purpose-built for the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-ultrabook-18-top-thin-and-lights-1054355"><u>best ultrabooks</u></a> around. With that in mind, they use impressively tiny amounts of power; even the flagship 7840U uses just 15W of power at base, almost half that of the base TDP of the competing Intel Core i7-1360P.</p><p>The RDNA 3 iGPUs are hugely improved here too, apparently crushing Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics, with performance as much as 139% better than the i7-1360P’s graphics. That’s at 1080p Low settings, but still impressive for a system without a dedicated GPU!</p><p>There will be four new chips: the aforementioned Ryzen 7 7840U, the midrange Ryzen 5 7640U and 7540U, and the affordable Ryzen 3 7440U. No Ryzen 9 chip just yet - we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s not planned, or if AMD is holding it in reserve for a later release.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-gaming-laptops">The future of gaming laptops?</h2><p>I’ve already noted that AMD’s new chips <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/look-out-nvidia-amds-new-cpus-could-kill-graphics-cards-for-good"><u>could be a huge blow to Nvidia </u></a>and the discrete graphics card market as a whole, and while the performance figures shown here don’t exactly blow me away (showing percentage comparisons rather than real-world framerates is telling), it’s still impressive.</p><p>AMD is really committing to its integrated graphics, and I couldn’t be happier about that: I’ve long believed that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/opinion/macs-arent-the-future-of-pc-gaming-but-integrated-graphics-are"><u>discrete graphics cards should be left in the past</u></a>, and processors like this are a step in the right direction.</p><p>After all, AMD already makes the chips that power our modern consoles, from the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nintendo-switch"><u>Nintendo Switch</u></a> to the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5"><u>PS5</u></a>. More recently, Team Red has pushed its new <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-z1-handheld-gaming-chips-lay-down-gauntlet-for-the-nintendo-switch-2"><u>Z1-series APUs</u></a>, which will be powering the intriguing new PC gaming handheld from Asus - the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/asus-rog-ally-gaming-handheld-everything-we-know-so-far"><u>ROG Ally</u></a>.</p><p>Low-power processors with impressive integrated graphics could prove to be the future of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-gaming-laptops-top-5-gaming-notebooks-reviewed-1258471"><u>gaming laptops</u></a> - if you’ve ever used a gaming laptop, you’ll probably know that most of them are big, bulky, heavy machines. That’s because they need to pack in a whole graphics card; and not just that, but a cooling solution and a large battery to support it.</p><p>Cut out the dedicated GPU, and you end up with laptops like the gorgeous <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/dell-xps-13-2022"><u>Dell XPS 13</u></a>: sleek, lightweight, and without the jet-engine fan whine of a beefy gaming rig. This is the future, folks! I’m tired of lugging around my chunky old Razer Blade! I want something slim and light, dammit! Let’s go, AMD!</p>
