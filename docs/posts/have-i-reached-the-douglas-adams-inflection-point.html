    <h1>Have I reached the Douglas Adams Inflection point?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
<p>The all-knowing sage <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Salmon_of_Doubt/xU3m_s5O7yMC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;bsq=normal%20and%20ordinary">Douglas Adams had this to say about technology</a>:</p><ol><li>Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.</li><li>Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.</li><li>Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.</li></ol><p>I grew up with a BBC micro. My earliest memories are of playing games and fiddling with BASIC.</p><p>I wasted my teens online. I could bind Trumpet Winsock with the best of them.</p><p>I did a degree in computer science.</p><p>I spent my twenties and thirties working on GPRS, UMTS, LTE, and all the other acronyms associated with mobile phones.</p><p>I dedicated the last half-decade to dispensing technology advice to the state.</p><p>I fricking <em>live</em> technology. My house is full of gadgets, I&#39;ve written code that&#39;s run all over the world, and I&#39;m currently studying for an MSc in technology.</p><p>But modern technology is <em>rubbish!</em></p><p>I&#39;ve been <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2021/12/certified-blockchain-professional-part-1/">studying Blockchain</a> and - while the maths behind it is nifty - it&#39;s clearly a solution in search of a problem. It&#39;s so far away from being consumer-ready - and has no obvious path to mass adoption. And that&#39;s before we get to all the scams surrounding it.</p><p>Augmented Reality still hasn&#39;t actually dropped into the hands of consumers. Even eight years ago when I <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2014/04/quick-thoughts-on-google-glass/">reviewed Google Glass</a>, it wasn&#39;t clear <em>what</em> it would be used for. Nothing in the subsequent decade has shown any practical use. I had a play with hololens and - while interesting - the effect was pretty unconvincing. <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2010/11/augmented-reality-games-how-far-have-we-come-in-7-years/">Augmented Reality games have been on phones for close to twenty years</a>. There&#39;s been the odd breakout hit like Pokemon Go - but it has hardly changed the world.</p><p>VR is actually here - although I remember the first wave in the 1990s. But it still hasn&#39;t got around the fact that you have to wear a cumbersome headset and try to focus a couple of cm from your eyes. And the videos coming out of Zuck&#39;s &#34;Metaverse&#34; look like N64 games - without the fun.</p><p>Self-Driving Cars seem to be as hyped as the Internet fridge. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-61080666">They can&#39;t even work out how to turn their lights on at night</a>! I&#39;m pretty well served by public transport - and there&#39;s no shortage of taxis. So I can&#39;t quite work out what a self-driving car is <em>for</em>. The world-sensing tech is cool - but it clearly isn&#39;t anywhere close to being good enough for real-world use.</p><p>Voice Assistants. I&#39;d say Alexa understands me about 75% of the time. That&#39;s nowhere close to good enough. And it&#39;s impossible to use unless you remember the exact syntax for every interaction. Yes, I love being able to turn on my lights by reciting a spell - but for anything more complicated they&#39;re just a flop.</p><p>5G. This was the moment I got out of the mobile industry. All the promises made about 5G were ludicrous. It&#39;s faster Internet. It isn&#39;t going to love you or save your dog. It just makes things a bit faster with slightly lower latency. Just like 4G did.  You&#39;re still going to have coverage issues because your provider doesn&#39;t care about your unprofitable area.</p><h2 id="counterpoints"><a href="#counterpoints">Counterpoints</a></h2><p>It isn&#39;t all doom and gloom though!</p><p>MRNA vaccines are <em>amazing</em>. I&#39;ve got them in my bloodstream right now. I can&#39;t wait for someone to use them to inoculate against HIV or to cure my lactose intolerance.</p><p>Fake meat is interesting. I&#39;m particularly fascinated by <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2018/04/synthetarianism/">Synthetarianism</a>. Sure, it&#39;s possible to live on a traditional vegan diet - but I can&#39;t wait to see what innovative new foods we can eat.</p><p>Contactless / NFC. I was an absolute <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2011/03/the-problem-with-rfid/">NFC sceptic</a> - and still am when it comes to &#34;tap to interact&#34; stuff. But for payments it has been incredible. Wave my phone near a vending machine and a can of cola pops out. Even if I&#39;m in a different country, it works. It&#39;s devilishly complicated behind the scenes - but so much effort has gone in to making it effortless for customers to use.</p><p>IoT is putting tiny sensors everywhere. Home monitoring is nice - but industrial monitoring is changing the world.</p><p>It has never been cheaper to manufacture bespoke circuit boards. You can custom build <a href="https://twitter.com/ancient_james/status/1534002794726031360">screens small enough to fit in a Lego block</a>.</p><p>Open Source has comprehensively won. Anyone can examine the code that runs their life. And, anyone can pick up world-class code and use it to power their new inventions.</p><h2 id="cutting-through-the-hype"><a href="#cutting-through-the-hype">Cutting Through The Hype</a></h2><p>Perhaps what I&#39;m bored of is <em>hype</em>.  I lived through the next-big-thing being 3D TV. I was sold on the idea that every home would own an Additive Printer. EInk is lovely, but hasn&#39;t broken out of the small-form-factor. No one is using social TV. Hydrogen powers precisely zero domestic vehicles.</p><p>I guess I have a low tolerance for over-hyped gimmicks which are forever doomed to change the world <em>next year</em>.</p></div></div>
