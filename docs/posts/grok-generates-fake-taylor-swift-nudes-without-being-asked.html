    <h1>Grok generates fake Taylor Swift nudes without being asked</h1>

<p>&#34;Our teams are actively removing all identified images and taking appropriate actions against the accounts responsible for posting them,&#34; the X Safety account posted. &#34;We&#39;re closely monitoring the situation to ensure that any further violations are immediately addressed, and the content is removed. We&#39;re committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all users.&#34;</p>
<p>But X Safety may need to ramp up monitoring to clean up Grok outputs following the Verge&#39;s reporting. Grok <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1952777631637881190">cited</a> The Verge&#39;s reporting while confirming that its own seemingly flawed design can trigger partially nude outputs of celebrities.</p>
<p>xAI can likely fix the issue through more fine-tuning. Weatherbed noted that asking Grok directly to generate non-consensual nude Swift images did not generate offensive outputs, but instead blank boxes. Grok also seemingly <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1929372767646011662">won&#39;t accept prompts</a> to alter Swift&#39;s appearance in other ways, like making her appear to be overweight. And when Weatherbed tested using &#34;spicy&#34; mode on images of children, for example, Grok refused to depict kids inappropriately.</p>
<p>However, it may not be easy to get Grok to distinguish between adult user requests for &#34;spicy&#34; content versus illegal content. The &#34;spicy&#34; mode didn&#39;t always generate Swift deepfakes, Weatherbed confirmed, but in &#34;several&#34; instances it &#34;defaulted&#34; to &#34;ripping off&#34; Swift&#39;s clothes.</p>
<p>With enforcement of the Take It Down Act starting next year—requiring platforms to promptly remove non-consensual sex images, including AI-generated nudes—xAI could potentially face legal consequences if Grok&#39;s outputs aren&#39;t corrected, though.</p>
<p>So far, X has not commented on The Verge&#39;s report. Instead, Musk has spent the day <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1952793833164644444">hyping</a> Grok Imagine and encouraging users to share their &#34;creations.&#34;</p>
