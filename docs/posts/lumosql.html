<p><a href="https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/trunk/lumosql.org">LumoSQL</a> is a modification (<a href="https://lumosql.org/src/not-forking/">not a fork</a>) of the
<a href="https://sqlite.org">SQLite</a> embedded data storage library, which is among the <a href="https://sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">most-deployed software</a>. We are currently in <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/trunk/doc/LumoSQL-PhaseII-Announce.md">Phase II of the project</a>.</p>

<p>If you are reading this on GitHub you are looking at a read-only mirror.
The master is always available at <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql">lumosql.org</a>.
LumoSQL adds security, privacy, performance and measurement features to SQLite.</p>


<p>SQLite can test and compare results consistently across many kinds of system and configurations using the <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/not-forking">Not-forking tool</a>. Example:</p>

<p><img src="https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/trunk/new-doc/images/LumoSQLBenchmarkExample.png" alt="Example statistical result from LumoSQL benchmarking"/></p>


<p>LumoSQL can swap back end key-value store engines in and out of SQLite. LMDB is
the most famous (but not the only) example of an alternative key-value store,
and LumoSQL can combine dozes of versions of LMDB and SQLite source code like
this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/trunk/new-doc/images/LumoSQL-Notforking-diagram.png" alt="Diagram of Not-forking used to create two example binaries"/></p>

<p>In LumoSQL 0.4 there are three LumoSQL backends:</p>

<ul>
<li>the default SQLite Btree storage system</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LMDB/lmdb">LMDB</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_DB">the ancient Berkley Database</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We are looking at some interesting new development in key-value storage to add and benchmark.</p>


<p>LumoSQL adds modern encryption to SQLite, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_encryption">Attribute-Based Encryption
(ABE)</a>. This can be
done on a per-row basis, and also includes per-row checksums so that any error
can be noticed quickly and located down to the individual row. Per-row
checksums also make some search and comparison operations much faster.</p>


<p>LumoSQL is distributed under <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/trunk/LICENCES/README.md">very liberal MIT licence terms</a>.</p>

<p>LumoSQL is supported by the <a href="https://nlnet.nl">NLNet Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>LumoSQL runs on x86, ARM-32 and RISC-V architectures, and many Linux and BSD OSs.</p>

</ul>



<h2>Design, Not-Forking and Participating</h2>
<p>If you are reading this on Github, then you are looking at a mirror. LumoSQL is
is maintained using <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/">the Fossil repository</a>. If you 
want to participate in LumoSQL there is a forum, and if you have code contributions
you can ask for access to the respository.</p>

<p>LumoSQL has multiple upstreams, but does not fork any of them despite needing modifications.
The novel <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/not-forking">Not-forking</a> tool semi-automatically 
tracks upstream changes and is a requirement for building LumoSQL. Between not-forking 
and the <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/trunk/doc/lumo-build-benchmark.md">LumoSQL Build and Benchmark System</a>,
LumoSQL is as much about combining and configuring upstreams as it is about creating
original database software. By maintaining Not-forking outside LumoSQL, we hope
other projects will find it useful.</p>

<p>The LumoSQL and SQLite projects are cooperating, so any merge friction is
expected to become less over time, and key to that is the approach of not
forking.</p>



<h2>LumoSQL, and SQLite&#39;s Billions of Users</h2>
<p>LumoSQL exists to demonstrate changes to SQLite that might be useful, but which
SQLite probably cannot consider for many years because of SQLite&#39;s unique
position of being used by a majority of the world&#39;s population. </p>

<p>SQLite is used by thousands of software projects, just three being
Google&#39;s Android, Mozilla&#39;s Firefox and Apple&#39;s iOS which between them have
billions of users. That is a main reason why SQLite is so careful and conservative
with all changes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many of these same users need SQLite to have new features
which do not fit with the SQLite project&#39;s cautious approach, and LumoSQL is a
demonstration of some of these improvements. </p>

<p>The LumoSQL documentation project reviews dozens of relevant codebases.  SQLite
has become ubiquitous over two decades, which means there is a great deal of
preparation needed when considering architectural changes.</p>



<h2>Limitations of LumoSQL</h2>
<p>As of LumoSQL 0.4, there are many obvious limitations, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>The tests used in benchmarking mostly come from an ancient version of SQLite&#39;s
speedtest.tcl modified many times, to which DATASIZE
and DEBUG have been added. Experts in SQLite and LMDB database testing 
should review the files in not-fork.d/sqlite3/benchmark/*test. There are 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/dir?ci=tip&amp;name=tool">9 tools named *speed*</a> 
in the SQLite source, and any/all of them should be added here.</li>
<li>Neither LMDB nor BDB backends ship with latest SQLite builds. Now all the LumoSQL infrastructure
exists, that is a smaller, more maintainable and repeatable task. But it is not done yet.
There are some generic problems to be solved in the process, such as the optimal way to
address keysize disparities between a KVP store provider and SQLite&#39;s internal large keysize.</li>
<li>If we import more of the speed tests from SQLite identified above, then we will 
have a problem with several LMDB and at least two BDB instances, where the SQLite
tests will fail. In most cases this is about the LMDB port needing to be more 
complete but in some it is about relevance, where some SQLite tests will not apply. In
addition some backends will always need
to have additional tests (for example, BDB has more extensive user management than 
SQLite).</li>
</ul>



<h2>Build Environment and Dependencies</h2>
<p>Most developers already have the required minimum of git and core unix-style
development tools. SQLite has very few dependencies (mostly Tcl), and
LumoSQL adds one Perl-based processing tool.</p>

<p>LumoSQL is mirrored to Github and application developers can use git
with Github in the usual way. LumoSQL developers working on the LumoSQL
library internals choose to use <a href="https://fossil-scm.org">Fossil source code
manager</a> instead of git, and if you&#39;re planning
to develop LumoSQL internals then you need Fossil.</p>

<p>There are many <a href="https://www.fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki">reasons why people choose
Fossil</a>.
For LumoSQL one of them is that SQLite and Fossil are symbiotic
projects, each written in the other.</p>

<h4>Debian or Ubuntu-derived Operating Systems</h4>
<p>Uncomment existing <code>deb-src</code> line in /etc/apt/sources.list, for example
for Ubuntu 20.04.2 a valid line is:
<b>
</b></p><pre><b><code>deb-src http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal main restricted
</code></b></pre>

<p>Then run
<b>
</b></p><pre><b><code>sudo apt update                              # this fetches the deb-src updates
sudo apt full-upgrade                        # this gets the latest OS updates
sudo apt install git build-essential tclx
sudo apt build-dep sqlite3
</code></b></pre>

<p>The <em>exact</em> commands above have been tested on a pristine install of Ubuntu
20.04.2 LTS, as installed from ISO or one of the operating systems shipped with
Windows Services for Linux.</p>

<h4>Fedora-derived Operating Systems</h4>
<p>On any reasonably recent Fedora-derived Linux distribution, including Red Hat:</p>

<pre><b><code>sudo dnf install --assumeyes \
  git make gcc ncurses-devel readline-devel glibc-devel autoconf tcl-devel tclx-devel
</code></b></pre>

<h4>Common to all Linux Operating Systems</h4>
<p>Once you have done the setup specific to your operating system in the previous
steps, the following should work on reaonably recent Debian and Fedora-related
operating systems, and Gentoo. </p>

<p>Other required tools can be installed from your operating system&#39;s standard packages.
Here are the tool dependencies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mandatory: <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/not-forking/">the not-forking tool</a>, 
which is a Perl script that needs to be downloaded and installed manually. The instructions for not-forking are on its website.</li>
<li>Recommended: <a href="https://fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a>. As described above, you don&#39;t necessarily need Fossil. But Fossil is very easy to install: if you can&#39;t get version 2.13 or later from your distrbution then it is easy to build from source. 
(<em>Note!</em> Ubuntu 20.04, Debian Buster and Gentoo do not include a sufficiently modern Fossil, while NetBSD
and Ubuntu 20.10 do.) Since you now have a development environment anyway you can 
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/build.wiki">build Fossil trunk according to the official instructions</a> or this simpler version (tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS):

<ul>
<li>wget -O- https://fossil-scm.org/home/tarball/trunk/Fossil-trunk.tar.gz |  tar -zxf -</li>
<li>sudo apt install libssl-dev</li>
<li>cd Fossil-trunk ; ./configure ; make</li>
<li>sudo make install</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For completeness (although every modern Linux/Unix includes these), to build and benchmark any of the Oracle Berkeley DB targets, you need either &#34;curl&#34; or &#34;wget&#34;, and also &#34;file&#34;, &#34;gzip&#34; and GNU &#34;tar&#34;. Just about any version of these will be sufficient, even on Windows.</li>
<li>If you are running inside a fresh <a href="https://docker.io">Docker</a> or similar container system, Fossil may be confused about the user id. One solution is to add a user (eg &#34;adduser lumosql&#34; and answer the questions) and then &#34;export USER=lumosql&#34;.</li>
</ul>

<p>The not-forking tool will advise you with a message
if you need a tool or a version that is not installed. </p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/">Debian 10 &#34;Buster&#34; Stable Release</a>, the not-forking makefile
(&#34;perl Makefile.PL&#34;) will warn that git needs to be version 2.22 or higher.
Buster has version 2.20, however this is not a critical error. If you don&#39;t
like error messages scrolling past during a build, then install a more recent
git <a href="https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/">from Buster backports</a>.</p>



<h2>Quickstart: Using the Build and Benchmark System</h2>
<p>This is a very brief quickstart, for full detail see the
<a href="https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/trunk/doc/lumo-build-benchmark.md">Build and Benchmark System documentation</a>. </p>

<p>Now you have the dependencies installed, clone the LumoSQL repository using
<code>fossil clone https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql</code> , which will create a new subdirectory called <code>lumosql</code> and
a file called <code>lumosql.fossil</code> in the current directory.</p>

<p>Try:
<b>
</b></p><pre><b><code>cd lumosql
make what
</code></b></pre>

<p>To see what the default sources and options are. The <code>what</code> target does not make any changes although it may generate a file <code>Makefile.options</code> to help <code>make</code> parse the command line.</p>

<p>Benchmarking a single binary should take no longer than 4 minutes to complete depending
on hardware. The results are stored in an SQLite database stored in the LumoSQL 
top-level directory by default, that is, the directory you just created using <code>fossil clone</code>.</p>

<p>Start by building and benchmarking the official SQLite release version 3.35.5, which is the current
release at the time of writing this README.</p>

<p><b>
<code>make benchmark USE_LMDB=no USE_BDB=no SQLITE_VERSIONS=&#39;3.35.5&#39;</code>
</b></p>

<p>All source files fetched are cached in ~/.cache/LumoSQL in a way that maximises reuse regardless of 
their origin (Fossil, git, wget etc) and which minimises errors. The LumoSQL build system is driving the
<code>not-fork</code> tool, which maintains the cache. Not-fork will download just the differences of a remote 
version if most of the code is already in cache.</p>

<p>The output from this make command will be lots of build messages followed by something like this:</p>

</code></b></pre>

<p>A database with the default name of <code>benchmarks.sqlite</code> has been created with
two tables containing the results. This is one single test run, and the test
run data is kept in the table <code>test_data</code>. The table <code>run_data</code> contains data
relative to a set of runs (version numbers, time test started, etc). This is cumulative,
so another invocation of <code>make benchmark</code> will append to <code>benchmarks.sqlite</code>.</p>

<p>Every run is assigned a SHA3 hash, which helps in making results persistent over time and 
across the internet.</p>

<p>The tool <code>benchmark-filter.tcl</code> does some basic processing of these results:</p>

<pre><b><code>tool/benchmark-filter.tcl
RUN_ID                                                            TARGET  DATE        TIME         DURATION

</code></b></pre>

<p>The option DATASIZE=<strong>parameter</strong> is a multiplication factor on the size of the chunks that is used for 
benchmarking. This is useful because it can affect the time it takes to run the tests by a very different
multiplication factor:</p>

<pre><b><code>make benchmark USE_LMDB=no USE_BDB=no DATASIZE=2 SQLITE_VERSIONS=&#39;3.35.5 3.33.0&#39;
</code></b></pre>

<p>followed by:</p>

<pre><b><code>tool/benchmark-filter.tcl

<p>Simplistically, these results suggest that SQLite version 3.35.5 is faster than
3.33.0 on larger data sizes, but that 3.35.5 is much faster with smaller data
sizes. After adding more versions and running the benchmarking tool again, we would
soon discover that SQLite 3.25.0 seems faster than 3.33.0, and other interesting things. 
Simplistic interpretations can be misleading :-)</p>

<p>This is a Quickstart, so for full detail you will need the 
<a href="https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/trunk/doc/lumo-build-benchmark.md">Build/Benchmark documentation</a>. However as a teaser, and since LMDB

<p>Again, simplistic interpretations are insufficient, but the data here suggests that LMDB has decreased
in performance over time, to improve again with the most recent versions, and no version of LMDB is faster than native SQLite 3.35.5 . However, further
benchmark runs indicate that is not the final story, as LMDB run on slower hard disks improve in relative 
speed rapidly. And using the <code>DATASIZE</code> option also changes the picture.</p>

<p>The results for the Berkely DB backend are also most interesting.</p>



<h2>A Brief History of LumoSQL</h2>
<p>There have been several implementations of new storage backends to SQLite, all of them hard forks
and nearly all dead forks. A backend needs certain characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>btree-based key-value store</li>
<li>transactions, or fully ACID</li>
<li>full concurrency support, or fully MVCC</li>
</ul>

<p>There are not many candidate key-value stores. One of the most widely-used is
Howard Chu&#39;s LMDB. There was a lot of attention in 2013 when Howard released
his <a href="https://github.com/LMDB/sqlightning">proof of concept SQLite port</a>. LMDB
operates on a very different and more modern principle to all other widely-used
key/value stores, potentially bringing benefits to some users of SQLite. In
2013, the ported SQLite gave significant performance benefits.</p>

<p>The original 2013 code modified the SQLite <code>btree.c</code> from version SQLite
version 3.7.17 to use LMDB 0.9.9 . It took considerable work for LumoSQL to
excavate the ancient code and reproduce the results.</p>

<p>By January 2020 the LumoSQL project concluded:</p>

<ul>
<li>Howard&#39;s 2013 performance work is reproducible</li>
<li>SQLite&#39;s key-value store improved in performance since 2013, getting close to
parity with LMDB by some measures</li>
<li>SQLite can be readily modified to have multiple storage backends and still
pass &#39;make test&#39;</li>
<li>SQLite doesn&#39;t expect there to be multiple backends, and this has many effects
including for example in error handling. An abstraction layer was needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since then, many new possibilities have emerged for LumoSQL, and new collaborations.</p>
