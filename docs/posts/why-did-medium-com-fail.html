    <h1>Ask HN: Why did medium.com &#34;fail&#34;?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Medium.com is still up and running so it hasn&#39;t failed exactly, but it&#39;s not the best platform to go to anymore when it comes to blogging.</p><p>The post quality has deteriorated, and it feels like I&#39;m reading the same posts over and over again. Not to mention the stupid paywall which is infuriating.</p><p>Why did Medium end up like this? In the beginning it was pretty good but then it started to wither. Is there any way for a platform like Medium to keep up with high quality posts while also paying their writers well?</p><p>Substack has done a good job at competing in the blogging market but it&#39;s different from Medium. Medium is more of a social blogging platform while Substack is more of a newsletter platform. Substack doesn&#39;t have an algorithm that recommends you content, but instead shows you exactly who you follow. This is nice, but I can&#39;t deny that I also like finding new content through a recommendation engine, which Medium <i>also</i> sucks at.</p></div></td></div></div>
