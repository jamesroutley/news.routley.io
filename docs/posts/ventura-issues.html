    <h1>Ventura Issues</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">

    <p>Tuesday, <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2022/12/">December</a> <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2022/12/27/">27</a>, <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2022/">2022</a> [<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Amjtsai%20since%3A2022-12-27%20until%3A2022-12-28&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">Tweets</a>] [<a href="https://pinboard.in/search/u:mjtsai?query=%22Dec+27%2C+2022%22">Favorites</a>]</p>
	
<div>

<h2>General</h2>

<ul>
<li>If a Save panel opens showing the most recently used folder, clicking <strong>Save</strong> will instead save to the <tt>Documents</tt> folder unless I specifically navigate to the already displayed folder manually.</li>
<li>Throughout Finder, apps, and the Dock, documents are shown with <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2022/12/01/blank-file-icons-in-ventura/">generic icons</a>.</li>
<li>Apple Watch login now fails most of the time for me.</li>
<li>Various operations, such as <code>rsync</code> over SSH, sometimes get really slow, perhaps related to high CPU use in <code>secd</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Finder</h2>

<ul>
<li>Revealing files in Finder (either from the title bar menu or a command in another app) sometimes doesn’t work, revealing an ancestor folder instead of the actual file, or sometimes doing nothing at all.</li>
<li>Finder sometimes loses all of its sidebar items.</li>
<li>Finder sometimes forgets which sidebar sections are expanded.</li>
<li>Sometimes mounted drives disappear from the <strong>Computer</strong> view, even though they are still mounted and in use.</li>
<li>Finder windows sometimes don’t get focus when I click on them, even though Finder does become the frontmost app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mail</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mail now loses the mailbox selection when you start a search, instead changing the selection to <strong>All Mailboxes</strong>, which is rarely the scope that I want.</li>
<li>Mail sometimes continues to show the <strong>×</strong> button in the search field when no search is in effect.</li>
<li>Arrow-keying through messages in Mail is slower, seemingly because secondary metadata is now lazily fetched from the database</li>
<li>Initially loading a mailbox when clicking on it is slower, seemingly because the sorting is now done in-memory rather than using a database index.</li>
<li>When composing a message, Mail sometimes mixes in rich text (e.g. different pasted fonts) when it’s in plain text mode.</li>
<li>Indentation is stripped from text when pasting.</li>
<li>Replying to a message in plain text mode sometimes inserts raw CSS code at the top of the quoted text.</li>
<li>Mail sort indicators still don’t match the direction (or sometimes even the column) that it’s actually sorting by.</li>
<li>The Mail rule editor sheet still has layout glitches when you add lots of criteria and can take over a minute to open.</li>
<li>Mail still sometimes freezes for several seconds when switching to it or doesn’t display the selected message (showing <strong>No Message Selected</strong>) until I click on another one and then back, or sometimes until I wait a minute or so.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Storage</h2>
<ul>
<li>External drives still take minutes to mount or sometimes never mount automatically. Sometimes I can manually mount them from Disk Utility. Other times I need to reboot or disconnect other drives first.</li>
<li>While a drive is in the process of mounting, various other apps beachball when trying to open or save a file (even if on the internal SSD that’s already mounted).</li>
<li>Finder often shows a drive as ejected before it is actually unmounted, so that if I turn it off or disconnect it when the icon disappears I get a <strong>Disk Not Ejected Properly</strong> notification about unexpectedly disconnecting the drive.</li>
<li>Finder often shows a drive as still mounted even after I’ve ejected it and it’s spun down and gone from <tt>/Volumes</tt>.</li>
<li>Sometimes encrypted drives prompt for the passphrase even though it’s in the keychain (a longstanding issue across several macOS releases).</li>
<li>Regularly connected drives don’t always mount at login before restoring apps, so apps can&#39;t restore state that depends on those drives.</li>
<li>Apps <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2022/12/01/long-app-hangs-due-to-spotlight">hang for long periods of time</a> when saving a file while it waits on Spotlight.</li>
<li>My spinning Time Machine drives are active all day compacting the Spotlight index, even after resetting it to make sure it wasn’t damaged. There <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2017/10/19/you-cant-turn-off-spotlight-on-your-time-machine-backup/">remains</a> no way to turn off indexing of APFS Time Machine drives.</li>
</ul>

<h2>System Settings</h2>
<ul>
<li>System Settings doesn’t show available software updates, even though they show up with <code>softwareupdate --list</code>.</li>
<li>System Settings shows <strong>Software Update Available</strong> in the sidebar when there’s no update if there’s an error contacting the update server.</li>
<li>Sometimes all the System Settings panes are blank.</li>
<li>Sometimes searching in System Settings doesn’t show any search results; it just continues showing the full list of panes.</li>
<li>I get <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2022/07/28/ventura-notifies-user-of-new-login-items/">notifications for new login items</a> that <a href="https://mastodon.social/@lapcatsoftware@mstdn.plus/109557964299658620">haven’t actually changed</a>. For example, checking a box in app A that adds a login item sometimes triggers a notification for app B (which hasn’t changed) and <em>no</em> notification for app A. I also get notifications for app B when deleting the plist file for app A. Sometimes I even get <em>multiple</em> notifications for app B (the wrong app) all at once.</li>
<li>The information in <strong>Login Items ‣ Allow in Background</strong> is inconsistent and unreliable. Sometimes, using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/713493">AssociatedBundleIdentifiers</a> works to display the name of the app instead of the name on the signing certificate; sometimes it doesn&#39;t; and sometimes it reverts to (part of) the name of the plist file even though nothing has changed. Some items change back and forth from verified to <strong>from an unidentified developer</strong> seemingly for no reason.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
<li>Safari sometimes gets really slow or stops responding entirely, so that some pages are only fully scrollable if I disable JavaScript.</li>
<li>QuickTime Player videos that I pause sometimes can&#39;t be resumed until I quit and relaunch the app.</li>
<li>Git Tower no longer remembers the width of the file list pane in the <strong>Working Copy</strong> view.</li>
</ul>
