    <h1>The SNESticle Liberation Project</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><article itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><div itemprop="articleBody text">
    <h2>Background</h2>
<p>SNESticle was the much requested, much anticipated, much rumoured, but never
released follow-up to NESticle, the legendary NES emulator programmed by Sardu
and released by Bloodlust Software in 1997. Sardu instead went on to create the
excellent Genecyst and Callus emulators and was eventually hired by Electronic
Arts.</p>
<p>Years later, EA released Fight Night Round 2, a boxing game that is supposedly
pretty good, but what is way more interesting is that the Gamecube version of it
contains an emulated version of Nintendo&#39;s Super Punch-Out!! (exclamation marks
part of the title, not for effect!!).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9a48z3/the-story-of-nesticle-the-ambitious-emulator-that-redefined-retro-gaming">Data
mining</a>
revealed the strings &#34;SNESticle&#34; and &#34;Copyright (c) 1997-2004 Icer Addis&#34; (Addis
being Sardu&#39;s real name) on the game disc. This raises a lot of questions,
perhaps most importantly (and unanswerably): did he really have SNESticle ready
to go back in 1997 and then chose to sit on it just to spite the people who were
bugging him for it? Or is the 1997 date just a joke, to spite the very same
people now? Or is the whole thing a joke? Who knows, but it&#39;s clear that there
is a working SNES emulator called SNESticle locked up inside Fight Night Round 2
and something has to be done about it!</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal of this project is to extract the SNESticle code from Fight Night
Round 2, to allow it to run on its own and to run other games than Super
Punch-Out!!. Mostly this goal has been met, it is now possible to create a
Gamecube ISO containing SNESticle and a single SNES ROM of your choice.</p>
<p>Some possible stretch goals that have not yet been reached (and possibly never
will be):</p>
<ul>
<li>A frontend for choosing between multiple SNES ROMs</li>
<li>Saving SRAM to a GC Memory card</li>
<li>Joypad 2 support</li>
<li>A standalone DOL file release</li>
<li>A native Wii port</li>
<li>A full disassembly</li>
</ul>
<h2>Non-goals</h2>
<p>It&#39;s important to note that SNESticle remains a Gamecube-exclusive program. This
hack will not allow it to run on your PC (except through a Gamecube emulator).</p>
<p>While it certainly would be possible to use this as a starting point for
further SNESticle development, bug-fixing, etc, I have little interest in doing
so. What I find interesting about this is that we finally get to explore Sardu&#39;s
SNESticle. If you just want SNES emulation on your Gamecube, you&#39;re probably
better off with Snes9x.</p>
<h2>How to run SNESticle</h2>
<p>First, get your Fight Night Round 2 ISO ready. It must be the US version and the
ISO file should have the md5 hash 1f6264dabc522271dbc5e3cd5fb6593b. Then grab
the scripts over at <a href="https://github.com/jolmberg/fn22snesticle">the github
repo</a>.</p>
<p>The README.md file explains how to generate your very own SNESticle ISO. It will
run in Dolphin, but obviously the real fun is in running it on a real console. On a
Gamecube, <a href="https://github.com/emukidid/swiss-gc">Swiss</a> is probably the way to
go. On a Wii, The Homebrew Channel and
<a href="https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont">Nintendont</a> or a Nintendont-enabled
loader will work fine.</p>
