That&#39;s a 14.7% rise in just six months.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It gives a real sense of what we&#39;re all facing at the tills, wherever you shop, and also gives a little glimpse into what the November figures will show us when they are published next month. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>If anyone was hoping for a reduction in food inflation then it doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s happening just yet.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, gas and electricity prices were still the main drivers of inflation after bills climbed again last month.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The government&#39;s Energy Price Guarantee scheme did mitigate those rises, limiting the average household bill to around £2,500 a year. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the ONS said gas and electricity prices were still up by nearly 130% and 66% respectively compared with a year ago.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Without the government&#39;s support, however, it said overall inflation would have risen to as high as 13.8%. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Greg Pilley is the founder of the Stroud Brewery &amp; Taproom in Gloucestershire, which supplies beer to pubs and shops. He told the BBC his business has been hit by a 10% rise in costs. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Electricity has doubled over the last year,&#34; he said. &#34;We&#39;re paying £70,000 a year compared to £30,000 in the previous year, but also raw materials are going up by between 10-15%.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He said he&#39;d had to put his prices up, while he was also paying much more in wages.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The future is fairly unpredictable,&#34; Mr Pilley said. &#34;We&#39;ve got to sell three times as much beer... just to stay in the same place.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Energy and food prices have been rising since last year because of the war in Ukraine and the impact of the Covid pandemic. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Rising prices have led to workers across a number of sectors calling for pay increases in line with the higher cost of living, with some industries such as the railways, staging strikes.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>How are you being affected by the rising cost of living?
