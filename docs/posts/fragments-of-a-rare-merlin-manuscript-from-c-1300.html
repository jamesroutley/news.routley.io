                  <p><span>A fragile 13th century manuscript fragment, hidden in plain sight as the binding of a 16th-century archival register, has been discovered in Cambridge and revealed to contain rare medieval stories of Merlin and King Arthur.</span></p>
                  <p><span>The manuscript, first discovered at </span><a href="https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><span>Cambridge University Library</span></a><span> in 2019, has now been identified as part of the <em>Suite Vulgate du Merlin</em>, a French-language sequel to the legend of King Arthur. The story was part of the Lancelot-Grail cycle, a medieval best seller but few now remain.</span></p>
                  <p><span>There are less than 40 surviving manuscripts of the <em>Suite Vulgate du Merlin</em>, with each one unique since they were individually handwritten by medieval scribes. This latest discovery has been identified as having been written between 1275 and 1315.</span></p>

                  <p><span>The manuscript had survived the centuries after being recycled and repurposed in the 1500s as the cover for a property record from Huntingfield Manor in Suffolk, owned by the Vanneck family of Heveningham. </span></p>
                  <p><span>It meant the remarkable discovery was folded, torn, and even stitched into the binding of the book - making it almost impossible for Cambridge experts to access it, read it, or confirm its origins.</span></p>
                  <p><span>What followed the discovery has been a ground-breaking collaborative project, showcasing the work of the University Library’s </span><a href="https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/chil" target="_blank"><span>Cultural Heritage Imaging Laboratory</span></a><span> (CHIL) and combining historical scholarship with cutting-edge digital techniques, to unlock the manuscript&#39;s long-held secrets - without damaging the unique document. </span></p>

                  <p><span>The text is written in Old French, the language of the court and aristocracy in medieval England following the Norman Conquest and this particular fragment belongs to the genre of Arthurian romances which were intended for a noble audience, including women. </span></p>

Traditional methods of conservation might have involved physically removing the binding to unfold the fragment, but this risked causing irreparable damage. </span></p>

                    <blockquote><span>“This project was a fabulous opportunity to employ all possible advanced imaging techniques from our photographic arsenal. And each of them brought something very important to light. This resulted in the creation of a set of unique digital objects which placed the original fragment in a whole new context and has transformed our understanding of it.”</span>

                  <p><span>Dr. Fabry-Tehranchi described the process as “like solving a puzzle.” &#34;If this had been done 30 years ago, the fragment might have been cut, unfolded, and flattened. But today, preserving it in situ gives us a crucial insight into 16th-century archival practices, as well as access to the medieval story itself.&#34;</span></p>
                  <h3><span><strong>A model for the future</strong></span></h3>
                  <p><span>Beyond revealing the fragment’s story of Merlin, this project has established a new benchmark for the conservation and digitisation of medieval fragments. </span></p>
                  <p><span>&#34;This project was not just about unlocking one text—it was about developing a methodology that can be used for other manuscripts. Libraries and archives around the world face similar challenges with fragile fragments embedded in bindings, and our approach provides a model for non-invasive access and study.&#34;</span></p>
                  <p><span>The discovery has already sparked interest among researchers and conservators, including those at the UK’s National Archives, who are keen to explore how these techniques might be applied to their own collections.</span></p>
