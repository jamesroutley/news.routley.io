    <h1>Fedora considers “privacy-preserving” telemetry</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
The Fedora project is considering <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/fedora-devel/CAJqbrbeOZrHvYjvMCc=qGZD_VXBs3-qReeirr+F8t01Eq1sYhw@mail.gmail.com/">a
Fedora 40 change proposal</a> to add limited, opt-out telemetry to the
workstation edition.  The proposal is detailed; it is clear that the
developers involved understand that this will be a hard sell in that
community.
</p><blockquote>
	We believe an open source community can ethically collect limited
	aggregate data on how its software is used without involving big
	data companies or building creepy tracking profiles that are not in
	the best interests of users. Users will have the option to disable
	data upload before any data is sent for the first time. Our service
	will be operated by Fedora on Fedora infrastructure, and will not
	depend on Google Analytics or any other controversial third-party
	services. And in contrast to proprietary software operating
	systems, you can redirect the data collection to your own private
	metrics server instead of Fedora&#39;s to see precisely what data is
	being collected from you, because the server components are open
	source too.
