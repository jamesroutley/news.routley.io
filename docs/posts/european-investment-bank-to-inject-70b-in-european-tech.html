    <h1>European Investment Bank to inject €70B in European tech</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The European Investment Bank (EIB) will invest <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/press/news/president-calvino-tech-firms-innovators-handelsblatt">€70 billion</a> into Europe&#39;s technology sector by 2027, aiming to close the innovation gap with the United States. This initiative seeks to strengthen Europe&#39;s position in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and military drones and to draw increased private investment, potentially unlocking €250 billion for the sector. EIB President Nadia Calviño emphasizes the bank&#39;s willingness to take more risks, notably speeding up the venture capital financing process, which could be pivotal for startups in a fast-moving market</p><p>The EIB plans to launch this initiative, dubbed TechEU, later this year, creating a centralized hub for financing requests from researchers and companies. This initiative aims to streamline the process, making EU funding processes faster and simpler. A quicker decision-making process can differentiate between the survival and failure of startups navigating tight cash flows and competitive markets.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/international/eu-foerderbank-eib-will-70-milliarden-fuer-tech-firmen-und-forscher-bereitstellen/100127812.html">interview</a> with German business newspaper <em>Handelsblatt,</em> Calviño has emphasized a newfound willingness to embrace risk within the EIB&#39;s financing strategies. The bank aims to process startup financing applications within six months, significantly improving from the current 18-month timespan. Calviño describes this accelerated timeline as a &#39;gamechanger,&#39; pointing out that the high-paced nature of tech innovation requires nimble response times to keep up with market dynamics.</p><h2>Investment climate in Europe</h2><p>Drawing on the current geopolitical landscape, Calviño sees the uncertainty generated by US President Donald Trump&#39;s economic policies as an opportunity for Europe. This environment increasingly attracts international investors interested in the stability and potential offered by the European market. The EIB aims to position itself as a beacon of stability and innovation, leveraging Europe&#39;s large market and academic prowess to bolster technological advancement.</p><p>Furthermore, the EIB has prioritized defense and security within its portfolio, recognizing its synergies with technological advancements. This approach acknowledges that investments in these sectors can stimulate technological development and fortify Europe’s technological agenda. As the EIB funds projects across various tech domains, it develops a comprehensive ecosystem where tech innovation is both shielded and nurtured.</p><p>With plans to co-invest with private investors, the EIB aspires to inspire confidence and mitigate risk through its backing, potentially catalyzing up to €250 billion in the European tech ecosystem. As the EIB awaits approval from the 27 EU finance ministers, this initiative underscores Europe&#39;s commitment to closing the innovation gap with the US and asserting its role as a global tech leader. The approval is expected to take place next month.</p><div><div><p><img alt="deeptech " loading="lazy" width="400" height="300" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fmedia%2Ffile%2F_W2_1466%2520(1)-min.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fmedia%2Ffile%2F_W2_1466%2520(1)-min.jpg&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 2x" src="http://tinylogger.com/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fmedia%2Ffile%2F_W2_1466%2520(1)-min.jpg&amp;w=828&amp;q=75"/></p><div><div><h4>Why deeptech can be Europe’s competitiveness flywheel</h4><p>According to several experts, the EU has an edge in deeptech and a key to the bloc’s future competitiveness. </p></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
