He did receive an honorary Academy Award in 2017. <!-- --></p><p>Sutherland was known for his political activism throughout his career, and protested against the Vietnam war alongside Fonda. <!-- --></p><p>He also channelled his beliefs into some of his roles, including The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, where he played the tyrannical President Snow.<!-- --></p><p>Sutherland told the BBC in 2015 that he hoped the film&#39;s socio-political message would help young fans become more aware of the world around them. <!-- --></p><p>He also told the BBC that the biggest changes he&#39;d noticed in the industry was that actors were making &#34;a lot of money&#34;. <!-- --></p><p>&#34;I don&#39;t think anybody of my generation became an actor to make money. It never occurred to me. I made £8 a week here [on stage in London]. When I starred in a play at the Royal Court, I made £17 a week, that was in 1964,&#34; he said. <!-- --></p><p>At the time, he said he had no plans to retire from acting.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a passionate endeavour.
