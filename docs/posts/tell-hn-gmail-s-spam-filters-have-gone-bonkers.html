    <h1>Tell HN: Gmail&#39;s spam filters have gone bonkers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I don&#39;t know what is happening with Gmail but lately Gmail&#39;s aggressive spam filtering created a huge problem for me.</p><p>It was a reply I sent to an email yet Gmail somehow figured out it was spam and the other person never got it (which I learned after 1 week)</p><p>Two weeks before they sent the property tax notice (from the govt) in spam and had I missed that email there would  have been a  penalty.</p><p>This is a very old Gmail address almost 10 years or more so I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening but I&#39;ve stopped trusting Gmail altogether after this.</p><p>This spam thing is such a black box, so don&#39;t be like me and check your spam folder just like you check your inbox if you&#39;re on Gmail.</p><p>P.S. Also looking for a good alternative to gmail if anybody has some suggestions. Right now I&#39;ve just created a filter to send all email to inbox.</p></div></div></div>
