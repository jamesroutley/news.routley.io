</p></div><div id="cc-m-7934490111"><p>
    All MIGALOO Private Submersible Superyachts are custom designed to meet the desires and preferences of the Owner.
</p>



<p>
    The preliminary design of the <span><a href="https://www.migaloo-submarines.com/m5-1-of-1/" title="M5 - 165M Submarine">165M MIGALOO M5</a></span> serves as an initial
    source of inspiration. The Owner is encouraged to modify and customize the design based on specific preferences and requirements. Therefore, the MIGALOOs Owner-centric approach begins with a
    comprehensive briefing, followed by the development of a General Arrangement (GA) plan and an initial design indication.
