That website, judyrecords.com, used a “unique access method” to pull the confidential records from its database and publish them, the bar said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">A representative for Tyler Technologies said Tuesday that the company is investigating the issue. A representative for judyrecords.com could not be reached.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">“Our obligation and responsibility are to the respondents and witnesses whose nonpublic information may have been shared, and again I apologize to them for this breach,” California Bar executive director Leah Wilson said in a statement.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">Wilson said the bar, which is responsible for licensing California attorneys and investigating those accused of wrongdoing, is working with judyrecords.com to remove all confidential attorney discipline data from the site.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">The state bar said it was notified on Feb. 24 by a complaining witness in one disclosed case that confidential attorney discipline records were available on judyrecords.com, which purports to have more than 630 U.S. courts cases in its free database. The administrator of judyrecords.com, who runs the site anonymously, later confirmed to the bar that those confidential records had been available to users since Oct. 15, 2021 until they were taken down on Feb. 26.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Under California law, attorney discipline cases are confidential until formal charges are filed. The information on judyrecords.com included case numbers, file date, case types and names of respondents and complaining witnesses. It did not include full case records, according to the state bar.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">“We thank judyrecords for quickly removing the files and look forward to similarly working expeditiously with Tyler Technologies to take the necessary steps to address this issue,” Wilson said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Read more:</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/california-bar-says-hack-exposed-1000s-attorney-discipline-cases-2022-02-28" target="_blank">California Bar says &#39;hack&#39; exposed 1,000s of attorney discipline cases</a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-10"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/calif-bar-hires-law-firm-probe-handling-tom-girardi-complaints-2022-01-24" target="_blank">Calif. bar investigates itself over &#39;Real Housewives&#39; husband Girardi</a></p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Karen Sloan</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p><div><address><a href="https://www.reuters.com/authors/karen-sloan/"></a><div><p><a rel="author" href="https://www.reuters.com/authors/karen-sloan/">Karen Sloan</a></p><p>Karen Sloan reports on law firms, law schools, and the business of law.
