    <h1>Unifi Travel Router</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><article><p>Slip it into your pocket, power it on, and your UniFi network follows you wherever you land. No reconfiguring, no rethinking, just the same environment you trust, now mobile.</p>
</article></div></div><div><div><article><h2>Your Network, Instantly Recreated</h2>
<p>Wherever you arrive, your network identity comes with you. Location aware policies, routing rules, and WiFi broadcasts light up the moment the router connects, giving you continuity instead of compromise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic geo based policy and Teleport activation</li>
<li>Instant routing and VPN enforcement</li>
<li>Bind to a UniFi site to automatically configure WiFi and Teleport.</li>
</ul>
</article></div></div><div><div><p>Familiar networking, even on first boot.</p></div></div><div><div><article><h2>Familiar Devices, Zero Friction</h2>
<p>Bring your UniFi gear and the tools you already rely on. The moment they power up, everything links together as if it never left home.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plug and play pairing with existing UniFi devices</li>
<li>Consistent LAN behavior across locations</li>
<li>No reconfiguration or manual adoption</li>
</ul>
</article></div></div><div><div><p>Connections stay consistent, even when the location changes.</p></div></div><div><div><article><h2>Small Form, Serious Uplinks</h2>
<p>The Travel Router may be compact, but it is engineered for flexibility. Ethernet, WiFi, or 5G connections via USB can all serve as uplinks, while captive portal logins on hotel networks are handled quietly in the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi uplink support including Ethernet, WiFi, and 5G from a tethered smartphone</li>
<li>Automatic handling of captive portal authentication</li>
<li>High performance routing in a pocket sized device</li>
<li>Multiple uplinks, one unified control plane.</li>
</ul>
