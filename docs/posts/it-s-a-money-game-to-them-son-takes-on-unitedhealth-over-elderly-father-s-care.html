    <h1>&#39;It&#39;s a money game to them&#39;:son takes on UnitedHealth over elderly father&#39;s care</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p><span>T</span>wo years ago, Robby Martin got an unsettling call from his father, Jackie. The 82-year-old told his son that a representative of the insurance giant UnitedHealth Group had barged into his nursing home room at 2.30 in the morning, announcing that he was going to be checked out at the end of the week.</p><p>Jackie Martin – who had been getting rehab at the nursing home after suffering a back fracture – still could not take more than a few steps without being out of breath.</p><p>But Jackie’s care there, which had started two weeks earlier, was eating into UnitedHealth’s bottom line.</p><p>The retired paper plant foreman was enrolled in UnitedHealth’s Medicare Advantage program, a federal privatization initiative that offers insurers a lump sum to cover services <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/basics/get-started-with-medicare/get-more-coverage/your-coverage-options/compare-original-medicare-medicare-advantage" data-link-name="in body link">comparable</a> to those under traditional Medicare. But the program’s pay structure means that the more care insurers deny, the more in taxpayer dollars they get to keep for themselves. </p><p>Jackie and his son appealed UnitedHealth’s decision and won. But the corporate giant issued another coverage termination letter the following week, then another one the week after that.</p><p>Martin was a quiet man who didn’t like conflict. The repeated denials left him exhausted.</p><p>“We talked and he said, ‘You know, I’m tired of this process every week. Let me just go home and see how I do,’” Robby recalled.</p><p>Soon after returning home, Jackie told his family he was no longer getting better and needed to find another care option. The next day – five days after UnitedHealth had cut off his nursing home coverage – he died alone in his bathroom.</p><hr/><p><em><strong>Send us a tip</strong></em></p><p><em>If you are a current or former United Healthcare or Optum employee and have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about nursing home care, please use a non-work device to call or text investigative reporter George Joseph via the <a href="https://signal.org/" data-link-name="in body link">Signal messaging app</a> at 929-486-4865.</em></p><hr/><p><span>J</span>ackie’s battle with UnitedHealth during the final days of his life is now part of a lawsuit accusing the healthcare conglomerate of wrongfully denying elderly patients care owed to them under Medicare Advantage.

But in a statement, Optum said its “number one priority is ensuring patients receive the care they need”.</p><p>“We believe this lawsuit has no merit and should be dismissed, as we have asked the court to do,” the statement declared, arguing that the company’s coverage decisions “are made by medical directors in accordance with Medicare coverage criteria for Medicare Advantage Plans ”.</p><p>Martin’s struggle to access care after a hospital visit is not a rare occurrence for older people enrolled in UnitedHealth’s Medicare Advantage program.</p><p>In recent years, UnitedHealth has ramped up its efforts to deny care for older patients following strokes, falls and injuries that require rehab, according to an October 2024 <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024.10.17-PSI-Majority-Staff-Report-on-Medicare-Advantage.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">investigation</a> by the US Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations. The federal inquiry found that UnitedHealth’s prior authorization denial rate for post-acute care for older people on Medicare Advantage shot up from 8.7% in 2019 to 22.7% in 2022. For Medicare Advantage seniors seeking post-acute care in nursing homes specifically, UnitedHealth’s denial rate jumped up dramatically during that period, from 1.4% to 12.6%, amounting to more than 34,000 denials.</p><p>The corporate spokesperson also added that the company “ultimately” pays “98% of all claims” it receives, when they are submitted in “a timely manner with complete, non-duplicate information”.</p><p>UnitedHealth’s past coverage denials caught renewed attention after the December killing of Brian Thompson, a top executive who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/health/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare.html" data-link-name="in body link">helped establish</a> one of its subsidiaries as the <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-in-2024-enrollment-update-and-key-trends/" data-link-name="in body link">dominant player</a> in the Medicare Advantage market. </p><p>In public statements, Trump’s pick to head CMS, Dr Mehmet Oz, and Republican policy leaders associated with the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 have <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/dr-oz-trump-nominee-journey-from-medicine-to-daytime-tv-to-cms-administrator/" data-link-name="in body link">shown</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2020/06/11/medicare-advantage-for-all-can-save-our-health-care-system/?sh=7d3194b24d12" data-link-name="in body link">more</a> <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-14.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">interest</a> in expanding Medicare Advantage than in curbing coverage denials under the program.</p><p>Republican senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the new chair of the Senate’s permanent subcommittee on investigations, did not respond to requests for comment about whether he planned to have his committee continue to investigate United Healthcare and other Medicare Advantage insurers.</p><p>“For Jackie, his family, and the countless other Medicare Advantage enrollees, we must fight denials of post-acute care,” Blumenthal said. “I will continue to speak out and hold private insurers accountable for putting profits over people.”</p><h2 id="the-process">The process</h2><p>Before he suffered a fall on the hardwood floor of his kitchen that left him with a back fracture, Jackie Martin walked two to three miles a day and ran on the treadmill at his local Y in Kingsport, Tennessee.</p><p>Jackie’s subsequent recovery in the nursing home was slow, but he was making progress.

(The social worker did not respond to requests for comment for this story.)</p><p>After that, Robby arranged a conference call with a manager from the UnitedHealth subsidiary, who said the notices would keep coming every week, Robby recalls.</p><p>“This is our process and this is what we do,” he recalls her saying.

You feel powerless.”</p><p>Robby and Jackie had successfully appealed UnitedHealth’s first two denial letters. But the week after the conference call with the manager, UnitedHealth sent Martin a third coverage termination letter.

Hours later, he got up to go to the bathroom.
