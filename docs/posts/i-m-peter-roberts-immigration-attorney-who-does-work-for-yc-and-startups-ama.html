    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I&#39;ll be here for the rest of the day. As usual, there are countless immigration-related topics to discuss and I&#39;ll be guided by whatever you&#39;re concerned with. Please remember that I can&#39;t provide legal advice on specific cases because I won&#39;t have access to all the facts. Please stick to a factual discussion in your questions and comments and I&#39;ll try to do the same in my answers.</p></div></div>
