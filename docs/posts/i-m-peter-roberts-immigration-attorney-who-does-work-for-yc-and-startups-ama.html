    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><p>I&#39;ll be here for the next 6 hours. As usual, there are countless possible topics and I&#39;ll be guided by whatever you&#39;re concerned with but as much as possible I&#39;d like to focus on the recent changes and potential changes in U.S. immigration law, policy, and practice. Please remember that I am limited in providing legal advice on specific cases for obvious liability reasons because I won&#39;t have access to all the facts. Please stick to a factual discussion in your questions and comments and I&#39;ll try to do the same in my responses. Thank you!</p></td></div></div>
