    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello HN! It&#39;s been about 9 months since we&#39;ve done one of these and it seems like time for another. Previous threads we&#39;ve done:  https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=proberts.</p><p>I&#39;ll be here for the next 2-3 hours and then after a break of about 1 hour for another 2-3 hours. As usual, there are many possible topics and I&#39;ll be guided by whatever you&#39;re concerned with. Please remember that I can&#39;t provide legal advice on specific cases for obvious liability reasons because I won&#39;t have access to all the facts. Please stick to a factual discussion in your questions and comments and I&#39;ll try to do the same in my answers!</p></div></div></div>
