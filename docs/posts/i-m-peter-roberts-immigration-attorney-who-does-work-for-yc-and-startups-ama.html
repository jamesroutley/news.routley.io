    <h1>I&#39;m Peter Roberts, immigration attorney, who does work for YC and startups. AMA</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ll be here for the next 3 hours and then again at around 4 pm EST for another 3 hours. As usual, there are many possible topics and I&#39;ll be guided by whatever you&#39;re concerned with but as much as possible - because we&#39;ve received so many questions about this the past few months - I&#39;d like to focus on the impact of the new administration on U.S. immigration law and policy. Please remember that I can&#39;t provide legal advice on specific cases for liability reasons because I won&#39;t have access to all the facts. Please stick to a factual discussion in your questions and comments and I&#39;ll try to do the same in my answers. Thanks!</p><p>Edit: Thank you again for the great questions and discussion. I&#39;m taking a break now and will return in about an hour. If I miss any questions before the AMA ends today, I&#39;ll do my best to respond tomorrow</p></div></div></div>
