As usual, there are many possible topics and I&#39;ll be guided by whatever you&#39;re concerned with or interested in. Please remember that I can&#39;t provide legal advice on specific cases for obvious liability reasons since I won&#39;t have access to all the facts. Please stick to a factual discussion in your questions and comments and I&#39;ll do the same.
