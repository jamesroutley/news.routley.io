As usual, there are many possible topics and I&#39;ll be guided by whatever you&#39;re concerned with. Please remember that I can&#39;t provide legal advice on specific cases for obvious liability reasons because I won&#39;t have access to all the facts. Please stick to a factual discussion in your questions and comments and I&#39;ll try to do the same in my answers!</p><p>Previous threads we&#39;ve done: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=proberts" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=proberts</a>.</p></div></div></div>
