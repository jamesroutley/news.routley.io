    <h1>Launch HN: Nomi (YC X25) – Copilot for Sales</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN, we’re Swan and Ethan, and we’re building <a href="https://heynomi.com">https://heynomi.com</a>, a real-time AI that helps you sell better while you&#39;re actually in the call.
Demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/XFxDCP8jdY8?si=CGnPM1zT4wxAvadJ" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/XFxDCP8jdY8?si=CGnPM1zT4wxAvadJ</a></p><p>Most of us aren’t trained in sales. We weren’t either. But in the early days, it’s the founders who have to sell, and learning that on live calls is brutal. After one particularly painful deal we lost, we joked that we needed an AI cofounder who could talk in our ear and save us from ourselves. That joke turned into a prototype, then a product.</p><p>Nomi joins your video calls and gives you phrase suggestions when it matters most:
– when someone pushes back,
– when there’s a hidden signal worth digging into,
– when it’s time to close (and how to do it without sounding pushy).</p><p>Then after the call, it auto-generates clean CRM notes, action items, and sends you a short email breaking down what went well, what didn’t, and how to improve next time—based on your actual conversation.</p><p>We’re also rolling out some features to make every call a learning opportunity and unlock revenue potential:
– A/B testing different sets of objections during calls and comparing results in real time
– Auto-update of your company’s sales playbook based on what’s actually working
– Upsell opportunity spotting and predictive revenue estimates driven by what people say on calls</p><p>The real-time part was the hardest. If advice shows up 2 seconds late, or it&#39;s off-topic, it&#39;s worse than useless. So we built a system with:
- a Thinking Model to track the call’s momentum;
- a tactic selector trained with reinforcement learning;
- a lightweight LLM (boosted with RAG) that delivers custom phrase suggestions under 500 ms.</p><p>Each user gets a private copilot trained on their own calls (with permission), plus simulated data and sales best practices. It gets sharper with every interaction, no manual tuning needed.</p><p>Right now, we’re live with 30 teams. One company went from $200K to $360K in just a few weeks. Another brought on a new rep who closed their first deal with Nomi on week one.</p><p>We also offer a free AI note-taker and free sales-coaching post-call emails. Just shoot us an email if you want to try it: founders@heynomi.com</p><p>We’re launching on HN to meet other folks who’ve felt this pain, founders doing sales, builders figuring things out on the fly. If that’s you, we’d love your feedback. Or if you just want to geek out about fast-inference LLMs, streaming RAG, or real-time UX, happy to go deep.</p><p>Let us know what you think!</p></div></td></div></div>
