    <h1>Tools I Use: firefox</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="Tools-I-Use-firefox">

<p>Firefox is my daily use browser. I’ve tried a number of browsers over the years, but I keep coming back to Firefox. Here’s a bunch of tools and features I use in Firefox:</p>
<section id="Bookmark-Keywords">
<h2>Bookmark Keywords</h2>
<p>Firefox allows me to add keywords to bookmarks. I can type these abbreviated shortcuts into the address bar instead of the full link. I can add keywords to bookmarks from the bookmark manager.<label for="fn1"></label><span></span><label for="fn2"></label><span></span></p>
<p>For example, I’ve set the shortcut <code>e</code> for my website (<code>erikarow.land</code>), since I use my own website as reference notes.</p>
<p>Now I can type <code>e</code> in the address bar and go directly to my website.<label for="fn3"></label><span></span></p>
<section id="Text-substitution">
<h3>Text substitution</h3>
<p>In addition to setting a keyword for a static bookmark, I can also use <code>%s</code> in the bookmark url for text substitution.</p>
<p>For example, I can set a bookmark for</p>
<pre><code>https://bookshop.org/search?keywords=%s
</code></pre>
<p>with a keyword of <code>bk</code>. Then I can type <code>bk data feminism</code> in the address bar to search for that book.<label for="fn4"></label><span></span></p>
<p>While working on a project, I could use bookmark keywords and text substitution to search through tickets or code forge issues.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="Address-bar-search-tab-search">
<h2>Address bar search (tab search)</h2>
<p>The Firefox address bar can be used to quickly access a search engine. But Firefox also has alternate search shortcuts that can be used to narrow the  suggestions that the address bar gives as autocompletions.<label for="fn5"></label><span></span></p>
<p>The autocomplete search I use most often is tab search. If I open the address bar and type <code>%</code> followed by a space, it autocompletes on only my open tabs. It’s often easier for me to search for an open tab than to manually scan for it, especially if I have a large number of open tabs.</p>
<p>There are a number of these built in:<label for="fn6"></label><span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
Add <code>^</code> to show only matches in your browsing history.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>*</code> to show only matches in your bookmarks.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>+</code> to show only matches in bookmarks you’ve tagged.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>%</code> to show only matches in your currently open tabs.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>#</code> to show only matches where every search term is part of the title or part of a tag.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>$</code> to show only matches where every search term is part of the web address (URL). The text “https://” or “http://” in the URL is ignored, but not “file:///”.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>?</code> to show only search suggestions.
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="Screenshot-Tool">
<h2>Screenshot Tool</h2>
<p>Firefox has a built in screenshot tool which I wrote about <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/notes/firefox-screenshot-tool">here</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="Process-Manager">
<h2>Process Manager</h2>
<p>Firefox has a built in process manager that allows me to see the CPU and Memory usage of every tab that I have open. With the browser acting as application platform, this is quite useful.</p>
<p>The process manager gives me the ability to unload tabs and kill the process for a specific website. When I want to do something memory intensive on my computer, I can unload a bunch of expensive browser applications.</p>
<p>The process manager can be opened with <code>shift+escape</code></p>
</section>
<section id="Developer-Tools">
<h2>Developer Tools</h2>
<p>Firefox has a suite of web developer tools. There’s way more than I know how to use, but I use some of the tools often:</p>
<section id="Mobile-View">
<h3>Mobile View</h3>
<p>Firefox has a responsive design mode, which allows me to see what my website would look like at different resolutions. I use the response design mode to see what my website would look and act like on a mobile screen. My sidenotes wouldn’t work unchanged on a mobile screen, so they turn into expandable notes.</p>
</section>
<section id="Inspector">
<h3>Inspector</h3>
<p>I often use the inspector tool to see how a specific element of a screen was formatted or styled. What HTML did they use? What CSS styles are active on that component?</p>
</section>
<section id="Developer-Tool-Keyboard-shortcuts">
<h3>Developer Tool Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Developer Tools | <code>F12</code> or <code>ctrl+shift+i</code><label for="fn7"></label><span></span>
</li>
<li>
Mobile View | <code>ctrl+shift+m</code>
</li>
<li>
Inspector | <code>ctrl+shift+c</code>
</li>
<li>
Console | <code>ctrl+shift+k</code>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="Pinned-Tabs">
<h2>Pinned Tabs</h2>
<p>I like to pin tabs that I refer to frequently, typically social media<label for="fn8"></label><span></span> and chat applications<label for="fn9"></label><span></span> that I use from the browser.<label for="fn10"></label><span></span></p>
<p>A pinned tab shows only an icon instead of a title, stays to the left of the browser window it’s pinned to, and does not get closed when using <code>ctrl+f4</code> or <code>ctrl+w</code> to close a tab.<label for="fn11"></label><span></span></p>
<p>I can pin a tab by right clicking that tab, and selecting “Pin Tab” from the menu.</p>
</section>
<section id="Always-Show-Scroll-Bars">
<h2>Always Show Scroll Bars</h2>
<p>By default, Firefox will autohide scroll bars after a short while. There is a setting to have scrollbars always show. I wrote an article about that <a href="https://erikarow.land/notes/firefox-always-show-scrollbar">here</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="Tab-Settings">
<h2>Tab Settings</h2>
<p>I have Firefox set to “Open previous windows and tabs” on startup. This restore makes it easier to close Firefox when I need to reboot or free up the memory firefox uses for something else.</p>
<p>I also turn <em>off</em> the setting for “Ctrl+Tab cycles through tabs in recently used order”. I want my tab cycling to be predictable.<label for="fn12"></label><span></span></p>
</section>
<section id="Extensions">
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>The extensions I use are:</p>
<section id="uBlock-Origin">
<h3>uBlock Origin</h3>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin</a> is a memory efficient ad blocker. It works, no complaints.<label for="fn13"></label><span></span></p>
</section>
<section id="ClearURLs-and-Privacy-Badger">
<h3>ClearURLs and Privacy Badger</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.clearurls.xyz/1.26.1/">ClearURLs</a> automatically removes tracking elements from URLs. When I click links that have tracking components, this extension will automatically strip them out.</p>
<p><a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger</a> detects any remaining third-party trackers that follow me from site to site, and stops them.</p>
<p>Both of these extensions work to improve my privacy, but when they’re working correctly I don’t notice them.</p>
</section>
<section id="DF-YouTube-Distraction-Free">
<h3>DF YouTube (Distraction Free)</h3>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/df-youtube/">DF Youtube</a> strips nearly everything from the YouTube UI. No comments. No sidebar. No recommended videos.</p>
<p>I’m left with a search bar and the playing video and description, and my focus.</p>
<p>I use DF YouTube to view videos on YouTube without getting distracted or stuck in a YouTube rabbit hole.</p>
</section>
<section id="OneTab">
<h3>OneTab</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.one-tab.com/">OneTab</a> will compress open tabs into a simple list with much smaller memory usage. It allows me to archive what I was working on without using all of my computer’s memory.</p>
<p>All tabs get saved to the same list, separated into groups based on when they were added to the “One Tab”. This list format is convenient for text search.</p>
<p>Previously, I would “archive” things I wanted to read by bookmarking them to come back to later, now I use OneTab for this purpose.<label for="fn14"></label><span></span></p>
</section>
<section id="Block-Site">
<h3>Block Site</h3>
<p><a href="https://webextension.org/listing/block-site.html">Block Site</a> allows me to restrict access to specific domains. When navigating to a blocked domain, instead of seeing that site, I see a specific “Restricted Access” screen created by the extension.</p>
<p>I use this to circuit break websites that I check compulsively. I can temporarily disable the extension at any time to navigate to those websites, but having the restricted screen is enough of a mental block that I usually stop checking those websites as often.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="aboutrobots">
<h2><code>about:robots</code></h2>
<p>Firefox has a hidden <code>about:robots</code> page with references to pop culture.<label for="fn15"></label><span></span></p>
