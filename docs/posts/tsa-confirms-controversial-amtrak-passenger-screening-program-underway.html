					The Transportation Security Administration has confirmed for the first time that the controversial screening of some rail passengers&#39; past travel records against a terrorist watchlist &#34;has already occurred,&#34; amid calls from Congress for greater oversight and demands from civil liberties advocates for an immediate halt to the program. The vetting, first revealed by the Hearst Television National Investigative Unit on Wednesday before it was known to have begun, is part of an Amtrak Rail Passenger Threat Assessment to determine if known or suspected terrorists have been riding America&#39;s rails. Initially, the watchlist searches are only being done with &#34;several months&#34; of past travel records from trips in the Northeast Corridor, the busiest in Amtrak&#39;s 46-state route network. The TSA is turning over to Amtrak statistical information on any matches and not the names of the individuals found, according to a Privacy Impact Assessment that had not been previously reported. &#34;The collection of data and analysis has already occurred,&#34; the agency said in a statement, its first comment on this week&#39;s reporting. &#34;This assessment is for research purposes. This is not in real time; we are not vetting people while they travel. This assessment only involves historical travel, meaning we do not get the data until after the passenger has traveled.&#34;The agency declined an interview request submitted before the original story was published.Reaction on Capitol Hill A spokesperson for Sen. Gary Peters, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, told Hearst Thursday night that the lawmaker &#34;represents some of the nation&#39;s largest Arab and Muslim American communities, and his constituents have raised a lot of issues with secondary travel screening from TSA and .&#34; &#34;He&#39;s requested more details from TSA on this Amtrak news,&#34; the spokesperson added.Amtrak, in its first statement on the matter — issued seven days after the National Investigative Unit first contacted the railroad — said, &#34;The safety and security of passengers and employees is Amtrak&#39;s highest priority, and we are always looking to take prudent action to improve security. The tests being done in conjunction with TSA are designed to evaluate how a system that has proven to be highly effective in providing safe travel in the airline industry will work most effectively in passenger rail operations.&#34;&#34;The assessment is an early step,&#34; the nation&#39;s largest passenger railroad said, &#34;in the development of further mitigation measures to proactively identify and act on potential threats to public safety on Amtrak.&#34;Amtrak also declined an interview request.Lawsuit threatenedGadeir Abbas, a senior litigation attorney at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, had warned on Thursday before TSA confirmed the program was already active that if the screening were to begin, his organization &#34;will file a lawsuit to challenge it.&#34; On Friday, CAIR&#39;s national deputy director, Edward Ahmed Mitchell said, &#34;We are reviewing TSA&#39;s latest announcement. Nothing we&#39;ve read so far changes our concerns about this program and our opposition to it.&#34;            Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, and Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX), who sits on a railroad subcommittee, both called for additional congressional oversight.Thompson said in a statement Thursday, &#34;TSA&#39;s plans to create this program without engaging Congress are extremely troubling.&#34;            Congressman Troy Nehls said in an interview he wants &#34;a little bit more oversight from Congress,&#34; but supports added security measures, as did Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.) who said, &#34;Americans deserve to feel safe when they’re traveling.&#34;WATCH NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE UNIT COVERAGE OF RAIL SAFETY:       2022: Group vows to sue Amtrak over screening of rail passengers against terrorist watchlist       2022: Amtrak Asks TSA to Start Screening Rail Passengers Against Terrorist Watchlist for First Time        2020: After decades of delay, rail safety deadline nears       2019: Delayed &#39;lifesaving&#39; technology added to NTSB ‘most wanted’       2019: Amtrak failing to spot, stop impaired employees       2018: Passenger railroads struggle to implement &#39;lifesaving&#39; technologyMark Albert is the chief national investigative correspondent for the Hearst Television National Investigative Unit, based in Washington D.C.
