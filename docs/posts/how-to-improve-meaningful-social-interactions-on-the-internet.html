<p>Perhaps we could make video chats more like the good parts of in person social interactions?</p>
<h2 id="could-i-make-it-more-like-meeting-a-friend-while-out-on-a-walk">Could I make it more like meeting a friend while out on a walk?</h2>
<p>For that approach, I’d want to build a “friend-finder” where you click that you have an hour free, and any of your friends can one-click jump into a video chat.</p>
<p>Several people have said they would value a serendipitous low-friction video chat organizer thing.</p>
<h2 id="could-i-make-it-more-like-an-in-person-conversation">Could I make it more like an in-person conversation?</h2>
<h3 id="fix-the-network">fix the network?</h3>
<p>I could decrease packet loss and latency by writing user-friendly network testing tools.</p>
<p>The goal there would be to figure out if the user device is overloaded, or the WiFi is too busy, or the user ISP is dropping packets.</p>
<p>If the goal is low latency peer to peer connections, perhaps a VPN like WireGuard (TailScale?) would help with that? I will elide technical details of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal">NAT traversal</a> for voice calls.</p>
<p>Perhaps network problems aren’t visible to end users? I’ve heard WebRTC has some sort of statistics reported, and my previous job experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">VoIP</a> suggests that’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol">RTP</a> based reporting.</p>
<h3 id="fix-the-user-facing-experience">fix the user facing experience?</h3>
<p>Sometimes I’m in a video call with several users and one of them is much quieter than the others, and my brain listens to the loudest person first.</p>
<p>Perhaps a volume equalizer audio mixer would help there?</p>
<p>Or what about just improving the inputs and outputs?</p>
<p>I recently bought a <a href="https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti-x/">better microphone</a> to record a <a href="https://anchor.fm/cofree-coffee/episodes/Shae-Erisson-e1f3o16">podcast episode</a>, and noticed that improved the way other participants experienced our video calls.
I used headphones on video calls so I don’t have to worry about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_suppression_and_cancellation">echo cancellation</a>.
I do not yet have a <strong>real</strong> camera, but I have seen the benefits when others used them.</p>
<p>So perhaps a webpage that lists these recommendations and links to a youtube video that shows the experience with and without each?</p>
<h3 id="fix-the-user">fix the USER?</h3>
<p>I personally have so much going on in my head that it’s hard for me to remember to STOP TALKING and listen.</p>
<p>Maybe conversational training would help people like me? I could put a card in front of my screen that says “ask the other people about themselves”.</p>

<p>Today I’m obsessed with several ambient music tracks that were submitted at Recurse Center’s Music Consumption Group.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chopped up cello in <a href="https://olivercoates.bandcamp.com/track/butoh-baby">butoh baby</a>, and the rest of the album is good too.</li>
<li>I asked the submitter of the above track for related music and heard about <a href="https://caterinabarbieri.bandcamp.com/album/ecstatic-computation">Caterina Barbieri</a>.</li>
<li>This math-named <a href="https://hallowground.bandcamp.com/album/dedekind-cut-the-expanding-domain-ded005">album</a>.</li>
</ul>
