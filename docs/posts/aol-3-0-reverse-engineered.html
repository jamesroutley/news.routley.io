    <h1>AOL 3.0 reverse engineered</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I&#39;ve recently joined the <a href="https://discord.gg/reaol" target="_blank"><strong>RE-AOL</strong></a> team - which has just<strong> successfully reverse engineered aolserver</strong> for AOL 3.0. It was done by a Canadian programmer named Zip. It&#39;s written in Python, a language he taught himself for this project — making it his first Python project ever.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR </strong>It&#39;s now possible to &#34;Sign On&#34; to AOL 3.0 in 2022. Here&#39;s a screen shot:</p>

<p>The backend of AOL, or rather the forms embedded in its client, are written in a scripting language from 1991 aptly named FDO91. It is poorly documented but we work with what we&#39;ve got. We&#39;re actively trying to get VPD/Rainman running for easy form design, but using notepad in the meantime with assets pulled from various <em>main.idx</em> files from old C:\AOL30\ installs. It&#39;s a challenging process overall.</p>

It contains installers for both 16 and 32 bit versions of AOL 3.0 with the tcp.ccl files modified to point at our Python aolserver, as well as applying the necessary compatibility settings. We&#39;re currently in the Alpha phase of development and non-Guest account logins are presently restricted to early adopters. There are currently only a handful of registered Screen Names.</p>
