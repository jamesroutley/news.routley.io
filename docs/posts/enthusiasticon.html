      <p>As a few of you know, I’m co-organizing <a href="http://enthusiasticon.de/">Enthusiasticon</a> this year. If you don’t know already, however, this blog post is for you.</p>
<p>Enthusiasticon is a small conference happening on March 31st in Berlin, and it’s free! The basic idea is that the speakers are talking for a maximum of ten minutes about a topic that excites them—or should I say “makes them enthusiastic”? The <a href="https://www.enthusiasticon.de/cfp/">CFP</a> is still open for another week; sorry for not telling you sooner. We’d be delighted to receive your proposals!</p>
<p>Our keynote speaker, Rachel Uwa from the <a href="http://schoolofma.org/">School of Machines, Making, And Make-Believe</a>, will tell us about what makes her excited, and deliver a little call to action. I’m especially excited about this part; I got to know Rachel briefly when I attended the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/123-rc-pop-up-two-weeks-of-collaboration-and-focused-work-on-generative-art">RC Popup</a> in Berlin—<a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/RC_Popup,_Project_I:_A_Ring.html">see also</a>—, and found her to be an incredibly welcoming person with interesting ideas, and I want to hear more of that.</p>
<p>We’ve also created a <a href="https://www.enthusiasticon.de/#keep-me-posted">newsletter</a> for you to subscribe to if you want to stay in the loop.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to thank our sponsors. My ever-gracious employer <a href="https://port-zero.com/">Port Zero</a> has been kind enough to help us out, and so has the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, who I’m sure you’re familiar with if you’re reading this blog—if not, check the bottom of the page!</p>
<p>I’d be thrilled to see you there!</p>
