<p>My friend @technekai and I always go on crazy adventures.</p>



<p>She suggested we go on a “vision quest” in the New Jersey Pine Barrens this year. I did not read the fine print and ended up spending 108 hours in a 10-foot circle surrounded by shrubby oaks, blueberry bushes, and pitch pines with no food and 4 gallons of water.</p>



<p>I logged my experience in 70 journal pages and counting, but I find it challenging to articulate what I did and how I changed.</p>



<p>Here are some reflections:</p>



<h2>I don’t want a frappuccino</h2>



<p>Our first stop after the ques was a Starbucks in Ocean Township New Jersey.</p>



<p>I looked at the pictures of frappuccinos and thought how delicious it would be to have a crushedwith sugar and – and with caffegone I had done without sugar and caffeine for at least two weeks.</p>



<p>Suddenly I felt this not for me. The frappuccino is not for me. I was offered all these options that look so appealing, but I didn’t want any of them.</p>



<p>The world gives us many options and tries to sell us them. But these options are not for us. We don’t want them.</p>



<h2>Seeing with my heart</h2>



<p>I would sit in the morning and watch the birds as they drifted down from the top of the pitch pines like leaves on the wind.</p>



<p>In my nonduality practice, I observe without labeling. For example, I watch a bird but do not label it a bird, or watch a leaf without calling it a leaf. I want to label and analyze everything, so this practice is hard.</p>



<p>To shift out of an analytic mode, I look with my heart. I set my intention in my chest and feel out – not look out. To feel with the heart. It to feel it is not to think. What does it feel like to be with a lover, a child, or an old friend?</p>



<p>Listening to nature is relational not analytic.</p>



<h2>Mirrors</h2>



<p>“Mirror mirror on the wall who’s the fairest one of all.’ said the evil queen in the Snow White fairy tYou cannot escape yourself when</p>



<p>You cannot escape yourself when you are in a 10-foot circle in the woods. All of nature is a mirror and just like in the fairy tale, the mirror does not always show you what you expect.</p>



<p>I had a hand mirror that I used for my twice-a-day tick check. One day I looked in the mirror and found a tick on my upper thigh. I should not have needed a mirror to see the tick – it was in plain sight. But I could only see the tick in the mirror.</p>



<p>If we see with our eyes, tools help reorient us.</p>



<h2>What does it mean?</h2>



<p>I will not spend my life on a vision quest in the woods. I have a family, a job, an artistic practice, and a community. But I wonder, what is my relationship with nature and with technology? The dichotomy seems bright to me; maybe everything is natural, but not everything is nature.</p>



<p>Right now, I have more questions than answers, but I have an open space inside that I don’t feel compelled to fill with false desires.</p>
