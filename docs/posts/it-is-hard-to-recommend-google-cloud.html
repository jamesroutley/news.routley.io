    <h1>It is hard to recommend Google Cloud</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><h2 id="google-domains">Google Domains</h2><p>A year back, I had to migrate my domain after Google decided to shut down Google Domains decided to <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/google-domains-to-shut-down/">shut down</a>.
I had to, not only, painfully setup multiple side-projects sub-domain mappings again on a new domain registrar but also re-verify my domain and re-create those mappings on <a href="https://ashishb.net/tech/how-to-deploy-side-projects-as-web-services-for-free/">Google Cloud Run</a>.</p><h2 id="google-container-registry">Google Container Registry</h2><p>Google Container Registry is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/prepare-gcr-shutdown">shutting down</a> in 2025.
It has been replaced with a new project called Artifact Registry.
So, why is Container Registry being shut down?
Probably because it 10X cheaper than Artifact Registry.</p><p>I just spent multiple hours migrating side-projects from GCR to GAR.
It wasnâ€™t easy.
Some <a href="https://decksaver.ashishb.net/">projects</a> were deployed multiple years back and are working perfectly fine.
Some other are <a href="https://musicsync.ashishb.net/">single-page homepages</a>.</p><p>The two migrations have been laborious.
While Google Cloud has made me jump hoops, there has been little upside in doing these migrations.</p><h2 id="google-cloud---great-engineering-good-product-terrible-strategy">Google Cloud - great engineering, good product, terrible strategy</h2><p>I strongly believe Google Cloud is a superior product to both AWS and <a href="https://ashishb.net/programming/how-to-deploy-docker-images-on-microsoft-azure/">Microsoft Azure</a>.</p><p>The UX is much simpler.
The primitives are much nicer and evolved compared to AWS.
The reliability while not as high as AWS is pretty close.</p><p>However, the continuous churn that I have experienced has made it hard to recommend it.</p></div></article></div></div>
