<h3><a name="Description"></a>Description</h3>
<p>Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. When the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a StackOverflowError that will terminate the process. This is also known as a DOS (Denial of Service) attack.</p></section><section>

<h3><a name="History"></a>History</h3>
<p><b>Severity is now Critical</b></p>
<p>The original severity of this CVE was rated as Moderate; since this CVE was published security experts found additional exploits against the Log4j 2.15.0 release, that could lead to information leaks, RCE (remote code execution) and LCE (local code execution) attacks.</p>
<p>Base CVSS Score changed from 3.7 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) to 9.0 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).</p>
<p>The title of this CVE was changed from mentioning Denial of Service attacks to mentioning Remote Code Execution attacks.</p>
<p>Only Pattern Layouts with a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) are vulnerable to this. This page previously incorrectly mentioned that Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) in the layout would also allow this vulnerability.</p>
<p>While Log4j 2.15.0 makes a best-effort attempt to restrict JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default, there are ways to bypass this and users should not rely on this.</p>
<p><b>Older (discredited) mitigation measures</b></p>
<p>This page previously mentioned other mitigation measures, but we discovered that these measures only limit exposure while leaving some attack vectors open.</p>
<p>Other insufficient mitigation measures are: setting system property log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups or environment variable LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS to true for releases &gt;= 2.10, or modifying the logging configuration to disable message lookups with %m{nolookups}, %msg{nolookups} or %message{nolookups} for releases &gt;= 2.7 and &lt;= 2.14.1.</p>
<p>The reason these measures are insufficient is that, in addition to the Thread Context attack vector mentioned above, there are still code paths in Log4j where message lookups could occur: known examples are applications that use Logger.printf(&#34;%s&#34;, userInput), or applications that use a custom message factory, where the resulting messages do not implement StringBuilderFormattable. There may be other attack vectors.</p>
<p>The safest thing to do is to upgrade Log4j to a safe version, or remove the JndiLookup class from the log4j-core jar.</p></section><section>
<h3><a name="Release_Details"></a>Release Details</h3>
<p>From version 2.16.0 (for Java 8), the message lookups feature has been completely removed. Lookups in configuration still work. Furthermore, Log4j now disables access to JNDI by default. JNDI lookups in configuration now need to be enabled explicitly. Users are advised not to enable JNDI in Log4j 2.16.0. If the JMS Appender is required, use Log4j 2.12.2.</p>
<p>From version 2.12.2 (for Java 7), the message lookups feature has been completely removed. Lookups in configuration still work. Furthermore, Log4j now disables access to JNDI by default. JNDI lookups in configuration now need to be enabled explicitly. When enabled, JNDI will only support the java protocol.</p></section><section>

<h3><a name="Description"></a>Description</h3>
<p>In Apache Log4j2 versions up to and including 2.14.1 (excluding security release 2.12.2), the JNDI features used in configurations, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.</p></section><section>
<h3><a name="Mitigation"></a>Mitigation</h3><section>
<h4><a name="Log4j_1.x_mitigation"></a>Log4j 1.x mitigation</h4>
<p>Log4j 1.x does not have Lookups so the risk is lower. Applications using Log4j 1.x are only vulnerable to this attack when they use JNDI in their configuration. A separate CVE (CVE-2021-4104) has been filed for this vulnerability. To mitigate: Audit your logging configuration to ensure it has no JMSAppender configured. Log4j 1.x configurations without JMSAppender are not impacted by this vulnerability.</p></section><section>
<h4><a name="Log4j_2.x_mitigation"></a>Log4j 2.x mitigation</h4>
<p>Implement one of the following mitigation techniques:</p>
<ul>

<li>Java 8 (or later) users should upgrade to release 2.16.0.</li>
<li>Java 7 users should upgrade to release 2.12.2.</li>
<li>Otherwise, in any release other than 2.16.0, you may remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that only the log4j-core JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability. Applications using only the log4j-api JAR file without the log4j-core JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.</p>
<p>Also note that Apache Log4j is the only Logging Services subproject affected by this vulnerability. Other projects like Log4net and Log4cxx are not impacted by this.</p></section></section><section>
<h3><a name="History"></a>History</h3><section>
<h4><a name="Older_.28discredited.29_mitigation_measures"></a>Older (discredited) mitigation measures</h4>
<p>This page previously mentioned other mitigation measures, but we discovered that these measures only limit exposure while leaving some attack vectors open.</p>
<p>The 2.15.0 release was found to still be vulnerable when the configuration has a Pattern Layout containing a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}). When an attacker can control Thread Context values, they may inject a JNDI Lookup pattern, which will be evaluated and result in a JNDI connection. While Log4j 2.15.0 makes a best-effort attempt to restrict JNDI connections to localhost by default, there are ways to bypass this and users should not rely on this.</p>
<p>A new CVE (CVE-2021-45046, see above) was raised for this.</p>
<p>Other insufficient mitigation measures are: setting system property log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups or environment variable LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS to true for releases &gt;= 2.10, or modifying the logging configuration to disable message lookups with %m{nolookups}, %msg{nolookups} or %message{nolookups} for releases &gt;= 2.7 and &lt;= 2.14.1.</p>
<p>The reason these measures are insufficient is that, in addition to the Thread Context attack vector mentioned above, there are still code paths in Log4j where message lookups could occur: known examples are applications that use Logger.printf(&#34;%s&#34;, userInput), or applications that use a custom message factory, where the resulting messages do not implement StringBuilderFormattable. There may be other attack vectors.</p>
<p>The safest thing to do is to upgrade Log4j to a safe version, or remove the JndiLookup class from the log4j-core jar.</p></section><section>
<h4><a name="Release_Details"></a>Release Details</h4>
<p>As of Log4j 2.15.0 the message lookups feature was disabled by default. Lookups in configuration still work. While Log4j 2.15.0 has an option to enable Lookups in this fashion, users are strongly discouraged from enabling it. A whitelisting mechanism was introduced for JNDI connections, allowing only localhost by default. The 2.15.0 release was found to have additional vulnerabilities and is not recommended.</p>
<p>From version 2.16.0 (for Java 8), the message lookups feature has been completely removed. Lookups in configuration still work. Furthermore, Log4j now disables access to JNDI by default. JNDI lookups in configuration now need to be enabled explicitly. Users are advised not to enable JNDI in Log4j 2.16.0. If the JMS Appender is required, use Log4j 2.12.2.</p>
<p>From version 2.12.2 (for Java 7), the message lookups feature has been completely removed. Lookups in configuration still work. Furthermore, Log4j now disables access to JNDI by default. JNDI lookups in configuration now need to be enabled explicitly. When enabled, JNDI will only support the java protocol.</p></section></section><section>

<h2><a name="Summary_of_security_impact_levels_for_Apache_Log4j"></a><a name="Security_Impact_Levels"></a> Summary of security impact levels for Apache Log4j</h2>
<p>The Apache Log4j Security Team rates the impact of each security flaw that affects Log4j. We’ve chosen a rating scale quite similar to those used by other major vendors in order to be consistent. Basically the goal of the rating system is to answer the question “How worried should I be about this vulnerability?”.</p>
<p>Note that the rating chosen for each flaw is the worst possible case across all architectures. To determine the exact impact of a particular vulnerability on your own systems you will still need to read the security advisories to find out more about the flaw.</p>
<p>We use the following descriptions to decide on the impact rating to give each vulnerability:</p><section>
<h3><a name="Critical"></a>Critical</h3>
<p>A vulnerability rated with a Critical impact is one which could potentially be exploited by a remote attacker to get Log4j to execute arbitrary code (either as the user the server is running as, or root). These are the sorts of vulnerabilities that could be exploited automatically by worms.</p></section><section>
<h3><a name="Important"></a>Important</h3>
<p>A vulnerability rated as Important impact is one which could result in the compromise of data or availability of the server. For Log4j this includes issues that allow an easy remote denial of service (something that is out of proportion to the attack or with a lasting consequence), access to arbitrary files outside of the context root, or access to files that should be otherwise prevented by limits or authentication.</p></section><section>
<h3><a name="Moderate"></a>Moderate</h3>
<p>A vulnerability is likely to be rated as Moderate if there is significant mitigation to make the issue less of an impact. This might be because the flaw does not affect likely configurations, or it is a configuration that isn’t widely used.</p></section><section>
<h3><a name="Low"></a>Low</h3>
<p>All other security flaws are classed as a Low impact. This rating is used for issues that are believed to be extremely hard to exploit, or where an exploit gives minimal consequences.</p></section></section>
