    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article dir="ltr"><div><p>WASHINGTON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said late Saturday it has closed some airspace in Montana for Defense Department activities.</p><p>The FAA issued a notice barring flights in an area about 50 by 50 nautical miles around Havre, Montana, near the Canadian border and classifying the area as “national defense airspace.”</p><p>The FAA declined to say if it was in relation to another balloon or another object. The FAA issued similar actions in response to a suspected Chinese spy balloon that crossed the continental United States from Montana to South Carolina and was shot down earlier this month.
