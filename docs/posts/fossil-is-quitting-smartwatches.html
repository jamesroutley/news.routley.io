    <h1>Fossil is quitting smartwatches</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Fossil Group has decided to call it quits on smartwatches.</p><p>The company announced this afternoon that it would leave the smartwatch business and redirect resources to its less-smart goods instead. The company has been one of the most prolific makers of Wear OS smartwatches over the years, and its absence will leave a large gap in the market.</p><p>“As the smartwatch landscape has evolved significantly over the past few years, we have made the strategic decision to exit the smartwatch business,” Fossil spokesperson Amanda Castelli tells <em>The Verge</em>. “Fossil Group is redirecting resources to support our core strength and the core segments of our business that continue to provide strong growth opportunities for us: designing and distributing exciting traditional watches, jewelry, and leather goods under our own as well as licensed brand names.”</p><p>This means that the Gen 6, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22764448/fossil-gen-6-smartwatch-review">first launched in 2021</a>, will be the last Fossil smartwatch. Castelli says the company will continue to keep existing Wear OS watches updated “for the next few years.”</p><p>This shouldn’t come as a huge shock if you’ve been paying attention to Fossil the past few months. Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/18js0zt/there_will_be_no_new_fossil_gen7/">Reddit</a> users had been reporting Fossil retail employees as saying Fossil was pulling out of the business, while others on the platform claiming “insider” knowledge said the company was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/18js0zt/comment/kdnjd1w/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">waiting for a new chipset</a>. The company regularly put out smartwatches through Wear OS’s toughest years and was often a permanent fixture at CES. However, the company was notably absent from the show earlier this month. What’s more, Fossil was expected to announce news of a new Gen 7 featuring the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/19/23268272/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-wearables-processor">Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Plus</a> platform in 2023 — however, it was nothing but crickets the entire year. Well, now we know why.</p></div></div></div>
