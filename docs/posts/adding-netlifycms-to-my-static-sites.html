    <h1>Adding NetlifyCMS to My Static Sites</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><header><p><date>Thursday, February 24th 2022</date></p></header><p>I started writing this post over a year-and-a-half ago. I wanted to kick the tires on <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">NetlifyCMS</a> and see if it was something I&#39;d feel confident recommending to people.</p><p>I was also curious if it might encourage me to write more. I&#39;ve found sometimes it&#39;s nice to allow yourself a means to publish that&#39;s less immersed in the code. It allows me to focus on the words I&#39;m writing and resist the urge to fiddle with the templates, CSS, the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> configuration and other things.</p><p>Also, despite loving <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, writing out the links has always felt a little cumbersome to me, and barely better than just writing out the raw HTML. It took me out of the illusion I was writing an article and always makes me extra aware I&#39;m writing something that&#39;s going to be transpiled into HTML further down the chain.</p><p>So here we are... a blog post written in Netlify&#39;s CMS!</p><p><strong>Installation</strong></p><p>It was very easy to get NetlifyCMS up and running. All you have to do is provide a YAML config file and a page somewhere on your site that pulls in the NetlifyCMS JavaScript files. It should just work, providing you&#39;ve described structured your <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/collection-types/">collections</a> and fields correctly. Some of the built-in <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/widgets/">widgets</a> you can associate the fields with are kind of useful and interesting. In particular I like the <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/widgets/#map">map</a> option.</p><p>The trickiest part for me was getting the Identity and authentication setup the way I wanted. Kind of confusing. Gets expensive in a hurry. I had to enable sign-ups, sign-up and then disable it? Seems kind of weird.</p><p><em>[Note: I wrote that in July 2020 and can&#39;t recall exactly what I did or vouch for that being normal. I cannot ever rule out user error</em> ðŸ™‚*]*</p><p><strong>Writing</strong></p><p>Once you setup your collections, it&#39;s pretty slick. I never bothered setting up a proper preview template, though I understand why you might want to.</p><p>I kind of like the minimal preview while I&#39;m actively writing.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/abbacfad765f2c2aabfdd0a6291f9b815cf2e4c5/64bb6/media/screen-shot-2022-02-23-at-7.33.48-pm.jpg" alt="A screenshot of my NetlifyCMS implementation"/></p><p>It&#39;s also nice to be able upload an image with a few clicks. I know that&#39;s been a solved problem for 20+ years ðŸ˜‚</p><p>The last, interesting bit to me is that way you can easily add interfaces to update other pieces of metadata for your posts. I added a few fields to handle the meta description, publish date, tags, featured image (for social media) and an optional &#34;country&#34; tag that I&#39;ve secretly (barely) used to try and group my travel posts together.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/999a9c347a15a11a22daed3bc83533053d82e052/a4976/media/screen-shot-2022-02-23-at-7.38.30-pm.jpg" alt=""/></p><p><strong>Publishing</strong></p><p>I&#39;m using the &#34;<a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/#publish-mode">Editorial Workflow</a>&#34; as it allows for drafts. It&#39;s designed to work with Git, with different editorial status steps being committed to different branches (I think), however the docs say it only works with GitHub repositories.</p><p>Without this workflow, it seems all content you write is immediately published to the main branch.</p><p><strong>Verdict</strong></p><p>All-in-all, it&#39;s fun and quirky, but I would have a hard time recommending it for a real project. It feels like a tool still very much geared towards developers, and a bit of a &#34;hobby&#34; tool as well. I&#39;d recommend it to developers still learning and experience developers who want a fun way to publish their blog, perhaps. I&#39;m not sure who else I might recommend it to?</p><p>I&#39;d be curious to see larger examples in the wild. Maybe I&#39;m my thinking here is too small.</p></section></article></div></div>
