<p><strong>A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by Energy Northwest and Curio sees Energy Northwest as an industry partner and potential off-taker of products produced through Curio&#39;s NuCycle nuclear waste recycling process. </strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/BlankSiteASPX/media/WNNImported/mainimagelibrary/corporate%20branded/Curio-Energy-Northwest-(Energy-Northwest).jpg?ext=.jpg"/><cite>(Image: Energy Northwest)</cite></p><p>The MoU is part of Curio&#39;s plans to deploy the USA&#39;s first state-of-the-art commercial nuclear fuel recycling facility that will provide a variety of in-demand commodities and products, the companies said. These include domestically produced low-enriched uranium fuel for the current US reactor fleet, as well as HALEU (high-assay low-enriched uranium) and transuranic-based TRUfuel for advanced reactors under development.</p>

<p>Curio announced its novel NuCycle process for used fuel recycling in February. According to the company, the process leverages &#34;decades of American research and development&#34; in a compact, modular, and proliferation-resistant design to recycle used nuclear fuel and develop off-take isotopes for a wide variety of industries. It has submitted a patent for the process to the US Patent and Trademark Office.</p>

<p>&#34;Yesterday&#39;s nuclear waste is holding back tomorrow&#39;s reactors,&#34; Curio CEO Edward McGinnis said. &#34;It&#39;s time to tap this enormous stockpile of unused energy and repurpose it into non-carbon-emitting fuel that will help power our future clean electricity generation needs. Curio&#39;s partnership with such an important nuclear utility leader as Energy Northwest represents an important step in realising the full potential of our NuCycle technology.&#34;</p>

<p>Bob Schuetz, Chief Executive Officer of Energy Northwest - whose generation portfolio includes the Columbia nuclear power plant in Washington State - said the partners&#39; exploration of the potential to recycle used low-enriched uranium fuel would represent a &#34;game-changing development&#34; for the commercial nuclear energy industry. &#34;Leveraging used fuel as a resource has numerous benefits: from reducing US reliance on foreign fuel and increasing US energy security and independence, to demonstrating the nuclear industry&#39;s long-term commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship,&#34; he said, adding that the development of Curio&#39;s NuCycle recycling process would be an &#34;invaluable tool as we embark on a promising new phase for carbon-free nuclear energy&#34;.</p>

<p>Reprocessing of used fuel from commercial reactors has been prohibited in the USA since 1977, with all used fuel being treated as high-level waste. However, the nation has more thanÂ 250 plant-years of reprocessing operational experience, mostly from reprocessing oxide fuels at government-operated defence plants as part of its military programme. A civil reprocessing plant at West Valley, New York, operated successfully from 1966-1972: a second one at Morris, Illinois, failed to work successfully and was declared inoperable in 1974. A third civil reprocessing plant was built at Barnwell, South Carolina but was not commissioned due to the changed government policy.</p>
