    <h1>Veo</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p data-block-key="6gb7v">Veo is our most capable video generation model to date. It generates high-quality, 1080p resolution videos that can go beyond a minute, in a wide range of cinematic and visual styles.</p><p data-block-key="c6nlk">It accurately captures the nuance and tone of a prompt, and provides an unprecedented level of creative control — understanding prompts for all kinds of cinematic effects, like time lapses or aerial shots of a landscape.</p><p data-block-key="a5heq">Our video generation model will help create tools that make video production accessible to everyone. Whether you&#39;re a seasoned filmmaker, aspiring creator, or educator looking to share knowledge, Veo unlocks new possibilities for storytelling, education and more.</p><p data-block-key="8rfgr">Over the coming weeks some of these features will be available to select creators through <a href="http://labs.google/videofx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VideoFX</a>, a new experimental tool at labs.google. You can join the <a href="http://labs.google/VideoFX" rel="noopener" target="_blank">waitlist</a> now.</p><p data-block-key="5veag">In the future, we’ll also bring some of Veo’s capabilities to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube Shorts</a> and other products.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="6gb7v">Greater understanding of language and vision</h2><p data-block-key="ecr6v">To produce a coherent scene, generative video models need to accurately interpret a text prompt and combine this information with relevant visual references.</p><p data-block-key="6mpal">With advanced understanding of natural language and visual semantics, Veo generates video that closely follows the prompt. It accurately captures the nuance and tone in a phrase, rendering intricate details within complex scenes.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="penxw">Controls for film-making</h2><p data-block-key="eg3us">When given both an input video and editing command, like adding kayaks to an aerial shot of a coastline, Veo can apply this command to the initial video and create a new, edited video.</p>
</div><div>
  <p data-block-key="40xdi">In addition, it supports masked editing, enabling changes to specific areas of the video when you add a mask area to your video and text prompt.</p><p data-block-key="8tcfm">Veo can also generate a video with an image as input along with the text prompt. By providing a reference image in combination with a text prompt, it conditions Veo to generate a video that follows the image’s style and user prompt’s instructions.</p>
</div><p data-block-key="u0m94">The model is also able to make video clips and extend them to 60 seconds and beyond. It can do this either from a single prompt, or by being given a sequence of prompts which together tell a story.</p><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="hx1qs">Consistency across video frames</h2><p data-block-key="dl81n">Maintaining visual consistency can be a challenge for video generation models. Characters, objects, or even entire scenes can flicker, jump, or morph unexpectedly between frames, disrupting the viewing experience.</p><p data-block-key="77hdm">Veo&#39;s cutting-edge latent diffusion transformers reduce the appearance of these inconsistencies, keeping characters, objects and styles in place, as they would in real life.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="t4vz1">Built upon years of video generation research</h2><p data-block-key="5icm9">Veo builds upon years of generative video model work including <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/neural-scene-representation-and-rendering/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Generative Query Network</a> (GQN), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06571" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DVD-GAN</a>, <a href="https://imagen.research.google/video/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Imagen-Video</a>, <a href="https://phenaki.video/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phenaki</a>, <a href="https://walt-video-diffusion.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WALT</a>, <a href="https://sites.research.google/videopoet/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VideoPoet</a> and <a href="https://lumiere-video.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lumiere</a>, and also our <a href="https://research.google/blog/transformer-a-novel-neural-network-architecture-for-language-understanding/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Transformer architecture</a> and <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gemini</a>.</p><p data-block-key="3mt37">To help Veo understand and follow prompts more accurately, we have also added more details to the captions of each video in its training data. And to further improve performance, the model uses high-quality, compressed representations of video (also known as latents) so it’s more efficient too. These steps improve overall quality and reduce the time it takes to generate videos.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="wdxqg">Responsible by design</h2><p data-block-key="conb7">It&#39;s critical to bring technologies like Veo to the world responsibly. Videos created by Veo are watermarked using <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/synthid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SynthID</a>, our cutting-edge tool for watermarking and identifying AI-generated content, and passed through safety filters and memorization checking processes that help mitigate privacy, copyright and bias risks.</p><p data-block-key="5bgom">Veo’s future will be informed by our work with leading creators and filmmakers. Their feedback helps us improve our generative video technologies and makes sure they benefit the wider creative community and beyond.</p>
