    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback"><main><p><b>Easel</b> is a 2D game programming language that makes <b>multiplayer</b> as easy as singleplayer.</p><div><div><div><p>With <b>Easel</b>, you can code as if all your players are inside one shared game world. Easel takes care of all the hard stuff like networking and synchronization, completely automatically! Multiplayer has never been so easy!</p></div><div><p><b>Easel</b>&#39;s <b>hierarchical</b> programming language, along with its <b>behaviors</b> model and <b>reactive</b> style, allow you to express complex game logic in a refreshingly simple way. Coding &#34;the Easel way&#34; is so fast and fun that you&#39;ll never want to go back!</p></div><div><p><b>Easel</b> is a great choice for your first programming language because its powerful enough to be <b>interesting</b>, but simple enough to be <b>accessible</b>. Plus, what&#39;s more fun than making multiplayer games you can actually play with your friends?</p></div></div></div><p>&#34;can i just say that i absolutely [...] love easel&#34;</p><div><p>Making games is fun, but it is even more fun when you can play them with other people! Unfortunately, online multiplayer games are <b>difficult</b> to make. They require managing networking, synchronization, authorities and prediction. That is a lot of work when you just want to get straight into making a game!</p><p><a href="https://easel.games/docs/learn/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> is <b>baked in</b> to the <b>Easel</b> programming language. Code as if all your players are inside one shared game world, and Easel will take care of the rest. While other game engines give you the building blocks to make multiplayer, Easel has already built it into the foundations of the engine itself so you don&#39;t even have to think about it!</p><p>Not only does Easel make multiplayer effortless, Easel&#39;s advanced <a href="https://easel.games/docs/learn/multiplayer/prediction">rollback netcode</a> implementation will give your game a smooth and responsive multiplayer experience, even with players across the globe.</p><p>With <b>Easel</b>, making a multiplayer game is as easy as making a singleplayer game!</p></div><div><p>Most game engines require you to organize code for the computer that runs it, not for the humans who read it. Often you are forced to invert your logic to fit their frame-by-frame update model, which can be difficult to follow and understand.</p><p><b>Easel</b> lets you structure your game logic in a more natural way:</p><p>Easel&#39;s innovative approach to game programming lets you express complex game logic in a refreshingly simple way. Coding &#34;the Easel way&#34; is so fast and fun, you&#39;ll never want to go back!</p></div><div><p><b>Easel</b> is a fully-featured end-to-end system for making games. It includes all the subsystems you need to make a 2D game, including graphics, audio, physics, user interfaces and more. There is an online game editor that lets you create and edit your game immediately without any setup. Then once you&#39;ve made your game, you can instantly make it available to the world. Easel&#39;s servers will host your game and make it available to anyone with a web browser.</p><p>Easel makes a great learning tool for <b>first-time coders</b> because it has everything you need to make a game in one place. If you are an <b>experienced developer</b>, you can use your own external editor and tools to work with Easel, while enjoying all the benefits of Easel&#39;s multiplayer and hosting features.</p></div><div id="testimonials"><div><div><div><p>can i just say that i absolutely ******* love easel, the programming language. i don&#39;t know how you did it ray, but you did it. you created the ultimate language. things that take days of effort and dozens of files in Java/Python/JS/whatever, here it&#39;s just, well i need to do a thing. how do i do a thing. oh okay so i do this this this. a component here. delete it here. indirect this via a generic signal, listen to it here. does it work? holy **** it works.</p><p>i think the unsung hero of this whole thing is <!-- --> &lt;Id=auto&gt; <!-- --> which makes all the automatic replacement possible. it&#39;s wonderful. it&#39;s the ultimate programming language</p></div></div><div><div><p>bruh how the hell does a game engine make me think &#34;oh **** i can&#39;t fix this, imma ask for help&#34; then doodle around with the logic then you fix the problem that was thought to be impossible 3 minutes ago</p><p>i love easel</p></div></div></div></div></main></div></div>
