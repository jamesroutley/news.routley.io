    <h1>Petition to stop Google from restricting sideloading and FOSS apps</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As Google will allow only apps from verified developers to be installed on Android (previous discussion): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45017028</p><p>A developer started a petition to stop Google from limiting app installation on Android devices unless developers provide personal identity documents.</p><p>Even though Google has not revoked similar controversial policies in the past, we do our best as much as we can. This change particularly threatens the freedom to build, share, and use software without giving away sensitive personal information. It affects independent developers, FOSS contributors, and even regular users who want to install apps outside of Google Play.</p><p>``Just imagine giving sensitive personal, government-issued ID to a corporation to install an app outside Google Play``</p><p>Letâ€™s stand together to protect our freedom to create and use software without handing over personal information to a corporation. Every signature, share, and voice counts here</p><p>Support the petition here: https://chng.it/MsHzSXtJnw</p></div></div></div>
