    <p data-block-key="m59qc">The podcasts feature a narrator, Laura, who guides you through the session, explaining when you need to run and when it&#39;s time to walk. </p><p data-block-key="10395">The podcasts also feature music to motivate you through the workout. They&#39;re designed to take you on 3 runs each week, leaving at least 1 day of rest in between each run.</p><p data-block-key="8jdxk">There&#39;s 1 podcast for every week of the plan – except in weeks 5 and 6, which feature 3 podcasts in each.</p><p data-block-key="kecko">This is because weeks 5 and 6 act as transitional weeks, which aim to progress you from a mix of running and walking into running for longer blocks of time.</p>

    <h2 data-block-key="9holn">How do I get started?</h2><p data-block-key="79txn">1. Download the Couch to 5K podcasts to your mobile device or computer. If downloading to a computer, you&#39;ll then need to copy the podcast on to your mobile device.</p><p data-block-key="ex9dw">2. When will you run? The best way to ensure you stick with your running plan is to carefully work out how to fit Couch to 5K into your day.  </p><p data-block-key="xb55f">3. Plan your route. You may want to look at a map to plan your route first so you can focus on running. There are lots of great websites out there to help you with this.</p><p data-block-key="n97rm">4. Think about safety. If you&#39;re planning to run outdoors, bear in mind that you may be less aware of your surroundings if you&#39;re wearing headphones. Watch out for other pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles. When running in the dark, make sure you can see where you&#39;re going and that other road users can see you. Consider running along routes with adequate lighting or wearing reflective clothing.</p><p data-block-key="f339m">5. What gear? The most essential piece of kit is a pair of running trainers.</p>
