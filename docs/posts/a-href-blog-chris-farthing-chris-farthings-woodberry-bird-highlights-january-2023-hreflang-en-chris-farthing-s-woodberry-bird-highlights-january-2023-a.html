    <div><p>January is typically a quiet month here with few surprises, though our regular winter birds still put on a good show for most of the month.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  <div itemprop="articleBody">
          <div><p>In some years <strong>kingfishers</strong> are seen frequently in early winter but have moved on by the new year, but this year sightings continued throughout January. At least two birds were seen, often giving very good views close to the boardwalk. Both <strong>water rail</strong> and <strong>snipe (below)</strong> were present all month but were mostly difficult to see. Exceptions were a short period of cold weather when water rails could be seen walking on ice, and a period of low water levels when snipe were easier to see on the mud.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>Past years have often thrown up a few more unusual ducks in January, but not this year. We did have a peak count of ten <strong>teal </strong>on the 21<sup>st</sup>. <strong>Shoveler</strong> were unusually not a regular fixture, being confined to a few sightings of a flyover pair.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>As the days start to lengthen, breeding-related activity starts to pick up. <strong>Great spotted woodpeckers (above)</strong> were busy, with males drumming in various trees, particularly along the woodland trail. <strong>Song thrushes</strong> were singing all month and <strong>chaffinches</strong> started singing by the end of the month.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>A flock of <strong>redwing (above)</strong> were on site throughout January. They were most often found feeding on ivy berries or resting at the top of the large oaks, but would sometimes feed on the ground along the woodland trail. At least one <strong>reed bunting (below)</strong> was seen a few times feeding high up in the reed-bed.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>Warbler species increasingly overwinter in the UK and we had a male <strong>blackcap (below)</strong> as well as at least two <strong>chiffchaff</strong> all month. With <strong>Cetti’s warblers</strong> being a year-round bird, it was fairly easy to see three warbler species on any day through January.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>The total number of bird species seen here in January 2023 was 56, exactly the same number as the previous two years, but well down on years with some very cold weather when the total has been in the mid-60s.</p></div>
