<p>You should start a blog. Having your own little corner of the internet is good for the soul!</p>
<p>But what should you write about?</p>
<p>It’s easy to get hung up on this. I’ve definitely felt the self-imposed pressure to only write something if it’s new, and unique, and feels like it’s never been said before. This is a mental trap that does nothing but hold you back.</p>
<p>Here are two types of content that I guarantee you can produce and feel great about producing: TILs, and writing descriptions of your projects.</p>
<h4>Today I Learned</h4>
<p>A TIL—Today I Learned—is the most liberating form of content I know of.</p>
<p>Did you just learn how to do something? Write about that.</p>
<p>Call it a TIL—that way you’re not promising anyone a revelation or an in-depth tutorial. You’re saying “I just figured this out: here are my notes, you may find them useful too”.</p>
<p>I also like the humility of this kind of content. Part of the reason I publish them is to emphasize that even with 25 years of professional experience you should still celebrate learning even the most basic of things.</p>
<p>I learned the “interact” command in <code>pdb</code> the other day! <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/python/pdb-interact">Here’s my TIL</a>.</p>
<p>I started publishing TILs <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/">in April 2020</a>. I’m up to 346 now, and most of them took less than 10 minutes to write. It’s such a great format for quick and satisfying online writing.</p>
<p>My collection lives at <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net">https://til.simonwillison.net</a>—which publishes content from my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til">simonw/til</a> GitHub repository.</p>
<h4>Write about your projects</h4>
<p>If you do a project, you should write about it.</p>
<p>I recommend adding “write about it” to your definition of “done” for anything that you build or create.</p>
<p>Like with TILs, this takes away the pressure to be unique. It doesn’t matter if your project overlaps with thousands of others: the experience of building it is unique to you. You deserve to have a few paragraphs and a screenshot out there explaining (and quietly celebrating) what you made.</p>
<p>The screenshot is particularly important. Will your project still exist and work in a decade? I hope so, but we all now how quickly things succumb to bit-rot.</p>
<p>Even better than a screenshot: an animated GIF screenshot! I capture these with <a href="https://www.cockos.com/licecap/">LICEcap</a>. And a video is even better than that, but those take a lot more effort to produce.</p>
<p>It’s <em>incredibly</em> tempting to skip the step where you write about a project. But any time you do that you’re leaving a huge amount of uncaptured value from that project on the table.</p>
<p>These days I make myself do it: I tell myself that writing about something is the cost I have to pay for building it. And I <em>always</em> end up feeling that the effort was more than worthwhile.</p>
<p>Check out my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects/">projects tag</a> for examples of this kind of content.</p>
<p>So that’s my advice for blogging: <strong>write about things you’ve learned, and write about things you’ve built!</strong></p>
