    <h1>iPhone 15: users of Pro and Pro Max models complain of overheating issues</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>Apple is facing complaints from users about overheating in relation to its new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">iPhone</a> 15 models, with some customers claiming the titanium frame becomes too hot to hold.</p><p>The iPhone maker’s community forum is carrying customer feedback about the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, claiming that the handsets are overheating.</p><p>“I’ve had the new iPhone 15 Pro and it’s so hot, it’s too hot to hold,” <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255154584" data-link-name="in body link">wrote one user</a>. Another wrote: “My skin hurts!!! What is going on with iPhone 15 Pro Max??”</p><p>There are multiple posts on the Apple forum referring to overheating of the iPhone 15 Pro series, with one user posting a photo of their iPhone 15 next to a thermometer recording a temperature of <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255147042" data-link-name="in body link">111F</a> (44C). There are also posts on <a href="https://twitter.com/itz_mohitverma/status/1706201557921083816" data-link-name="in body link">X</a> and Reddit.</p><p>Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst at TF International Securities, <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/the-iphone-15-pro-series-overheating-issues-are-unrelated-to-tsmcs-advanced-3nm-node-iphone-15-5f354b1ab155" data-link-name="in body link">said</a> any overheating issue was probably due to “compromises” in the phone’s design as the company attempted to reduce the product’s weight.</p><p>The iPhone Pro model has a frame made from titanium, a poor conductor of heat, which could hamper the handset’s ability to disperse heat. Previously, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Apple</a> has used stainless steel for its high-end phones.</p><p>Kuo wrote: “The primary cause is more likely the compromises made in the thermal system design to achieve a lighter weight, such as the reduced heat dissipation area and the use of a titanium frame, which negatively impacts thermal efficiency.”</p><p>He said Apple would probably address the problem through software updates. Kuo said the reported problem was unlikely to have been caused by a new Taiwan-made chip deployed in the Pro models.</p><p>However, the analyst indicated that the problem could affect iPhone Pro sales if it was not addressed. The iPhone 15 went on sale last week. In the UK, it costs from £799 for the basic model to £999 for the Pro and £1,199 for the larger Pro Max.</p><p>“If Apple does not properly address this issue, it could negatively impact shipments over the product life cycle of the iPhone 15 Pro series,” said Kuo.</p><p>Apple has been contacted for comment.</p><p>The company’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201678" data-link-name="in body link">customer support pages</a> state that devices might get warm when being set up for the first time, when they are being charged wirelessly or if customers are using graphics-intensive or processor-intensive apps such as games.</p></div></div></div>
