<p>I was in an electronics store that doesn&#39;t exist anymore, like Radio Shack or Circuit City. I was just in there to look around, wasn&#39;t intending to buy anything, when one of the clerks approaches me and asks if they can help. As a joke, I asked if they had a Lappy 486, one of the computers Strong Bad used to check his emails in Homestar Runner.</p>

<p>The clerk smirked. &#34;You&#39;re in luck, we still have one in stock.&#34; They unlocked a glass case behind the counter and pulled out a box. It was $450, which I could not afford, but I bought it because it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. &#34;This thing doesn&#39;t exist,&#34; I reassured myself, &#34;Once I&#39;m done messing with it I can probably sell it on ebay for twice that.&#34;</p>
<p>I got it home and started looking at the documentation. It was released as limited-edition H*R merch in 2011. It was an all-plastic beige box that was quite a bit chunkier than the Lappy from the cartoons, although it was much lighter than it looks, because it had modern-for-2011 components inside. It looked like one of the old Tandy laptops that are almost too big to actually use on one&#39;s lap:</p>

<p>Except instead of an LCD, it had an intense green LED display meant to evoke the green phosphor display of old monochrome CRTs. On the built-in screen you could play a number of Homestar Runner-themed text adventures, with crude but charming ASCII graphics and short PC speaker ditties.</p>

<p>If you flip the &#34;TV&#34; switch, to my astonishment, it used a built-in RF modulator to broadcast a signal to your TV. No wires needed, just turn your TV to channel 3 and the picture would appear. I speculated that this is why the device was so rare, the FCC surely wouldn&#39;t allow this sort of thing to be sold. But I was sure that in present-day nobody would care about the interference. In TV mode, the games had graphics but they were still crude, on par with what you see in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjxWTSaUVvs">Mario Paint animations</a> (youtube.com.) It had full MIDI sound and occasional digitized speech samples.</p>
<p>Wondering what else I could do with the computer, I booted up a thumb drive with a linux installer --- the only inputs or outputs were a 3¬Ω&#34; floppy drive and a USB port --- and got to the step of the installer where it was preparing to partition the hard drive. I realized with a sudden shock that I needed to image the drive before I did <em>anything</em> else with the computer, I might have the only one of these in existence, there were zero references to the computer online, not even on the H*R wiki... but I didn&#39;t have the tools I needed to image the drive and I spent all my money on the computer. I was dismayed at the thought that my only choice would be to sell the computer, and I couldn&#39;t guarantee that whoever bought it would release the contents of the drive. The world might never see the lost H*R games that were on it. In despair, I woke up ü¶ù</p>
