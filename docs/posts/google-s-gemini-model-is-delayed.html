    <h1>Google&#39;s Gemini model is delayed</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google’s next-generation ‘Gemini’ AI model is reportedly delayed.</p><p>Earlier this year, Google combined two AI teams <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23691468/google-ai-deepmind-brain-merger">into one group</a> which is working on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23610427/chatbots-chatgpt-new-bing-google-bard-conversational-ai">new model to compete with OpenAI’s GPT-4</a>. Its leader, Demis Hassabis, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23778745/demis-hassabis-google-deepmind-ai-alphafold-risks#:~:text=And%20we%E2%80%99re%20already,impressive%20to%20see.">discussed</a> the combo <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/79LbAd3Yc8lyeLQms0WQTL?t=1410">on <em>Decoder</em></a>:</p><blockquote><p>And we’re already feeling, even a couple of months in, the benefits and the strengths of that with projects like Gemini that you may have heard of, which is our next-generation multimodal large models — very, very exciting work going on there, combining all the best ideas from across both world-class research groups. It’s pretty impressive to see.</p></blockquote><p>Now, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-delays-cloud-release-of-gemini-ai-that-aims-to-compete-with-openai"><em>The Information</em></a> cites two sources saying its launch is expected in Q1 of 2024, not this month as they were previously told. It also reports Google co-founder Sergey Brin has been spending “four to five days a week” with the developers.</p><br/></div></div>
