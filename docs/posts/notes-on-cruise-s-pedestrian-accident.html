    <h1>Notes on Cruise&#39;s pedestrian accident</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>This is a set of notes on the Quinn Emanuel report on Cruise&#39;s handling of the 2023-10-02 accident where a Cruise autonomous vehicle (AV) hit a pedestrian, stopped, and then started moving again with the pedestrian stuck under the bottom of the AV, dragging the pedestrian 20 feet. After seeing some comments about this report, I read five stories on this report and then skimmed the report and my feeling is that the authors of four of the stories probably didn&#39;t read the report, and that people who were commenting had generally read stories by journalists who did not appear to read the source material, so the comments were generally way off base. <a href="https://github.com/dunning-kruger/">As we previously discussed, it&#39;s common for summaries to be wildly wrong, even when they&#39;re summarizing a short paper that&#39;s easily read by laypeople</a>, so of course summaries of a 200-page report are likely to be misleading at best.</p> <p>On reading the entire report, I&#39;d say that Cruise both looks better and worse than in the articles I saw, which is the same pattern we saw when we looked at the actual source for <a href="https://github.com/elon-twitter-texts/">Exhibits H and J from Twitter v. Musk</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/us-v-ms/">United States v. Microsoft Corp. docs</a>, etc.; just as some journalists seem to be pro/anti-Elon Musk and pro/anti-Microsoft, willing to push an inaccurate narrative to dunk on them to the maximum extent possible or exonerate them to the maximum extent possible, we see the same thing here with Cruise. And as we saw in those cases, despite some articles seemingly trying to paint Cruise in the best or worst light possible, the report itself has material that is more positive and more negative than we see in the most positive or negative stories.</p> <p>Aside from correcting misleading opinions on the report, I find the report interesting because it&#39;s rare to see any kind of investigation over what went wrong in tech in this level of detail, let alone a public one. We often see this kind of investigation in safety critical systems and sometimes see in sports as well as for historical events, but tech events are usually not covered like this. Of course companies do post-mortems of incidents, but you generally won&#39;t see a 200-page report on a single incident, nor will the focus of post-mortems be what the focus was here. In the past, <a href="https://github.com/wat/">we&#39;ve noted that a lot can be learned by looking at the literature and incident reports on safety-critical systems</a>, so of course this is true here as well, where we see a safety-critical system that&#39;s more tech adjacent than the ones we&#39;ve looked at previously.</p> <p>The length and depth of the report here reflects a difference in culture between safety-critical systems and &#34;tech&#34;. The behavior that&#39;s described as unconscionable in the report is not only normal in tech, but probably more transparent and above board than you&#39;d see at most major tech companies; I find the culture clash between tech and safety-critical systems interesting as well. I attempted to inject as little of my opinion as possible into the report as possible, even in cases where knowledge of tech companies or engineering meant that I would&#39;ve personally written something different.

Review Plan Methodology and Limitations</h3> <ul> <li>205k &#34;documents&#34;, including &#34; including e-mails, texts, Slack communications, and internal Cruise documents&#34;</li> <li>Interviewed 88 current and former employees and contractors</li> <li>Reviewed a report by Exponent Inc., 3rd party firm</li> <li>Internal review only; did not interview regulators and public officials</li> <li>A number of employees and contractors were not available &#34;due to personal circumstances and/or the wide-scale Reduction in Force&#34;, but these interviews were not deemed to be important</li> <li>Report doesn&#39;t address broader issues outside of mandate, &#34;such as the safety or safety processes of Cruise AVs or its operations, which are more appropriately evaluated by those with engineering and technical safety expertise&#34;</li> </ul> <h3 id="d-summary-of-principal-findings-and-conclusions">D. Summary of Principal Findings and Conclusions</h3> <ul> <li>By morning of <strong>10-03</strong>, leadership and 100+ employees knew the pedestrian had been dragged ~20ft. by the Cruise AV during the secondary movement after the AV came to a stop.</li> <li>Plan was to disclose this happened by playing the full video, &#34;letting the &#39;video speak for itself.&#39;&#34; <ul> <li>Cruise assumed that regulators and government officials would ask questions and Cruise would provide further info</li> </ul></li> <li>&#34;Weight of the evidence&#34; is that Cruise attempted to play the full video, but in 3 meetings, internet issues prevented this from happening and Cruise didn&#39;t point out that the pedestrian dragging happened</li> <li>On <strong>10-02</strong> and <strong>10-03</strong>, &#34;Cruise leadership was fixated on correcting the inaccurate media narrative&#34; that Cruise&#39;s AV had caused the accident <ul> <li>This led Cruise to convey information about the Nissan and omit &#34;other important information&#34; about the accident to &#34;the media, regulators, and other government officials&#34;</li> </ul></li> <li>&#34;The reasons for Cruise’s failings in this instance are numerous: poor leadership, mistakes in judgment, lack of coordination, an &#39;us versus them&#39; mentality with regulators, and a fundamental misapprehension of Cruise’s obligations of accountability and transparency to the government and the public. Cruise must take decisive steps to address these issues in order to restore trust and credibility.&#34;</li> <li>&#34;the DMV Suspension Order is a direct result of a proverbial self-inflicted wound by certain senior Cruise leadership and employees who appear not to have fully appreciated how a regulated business should interact with its regulators ... it was a fundamentally flawed approach for Cruise or any other business to take the position that a video of an accident causing serious injury provides all necessary information to regulators and otherwise relieves them of the need to affirmatively and fully inform these regulators of all relevant facts. As one Cruise employee stated in a text message to another employee about this matter, our &#39;leaders have failed us.&#39;&#34;</li> </ul> <h2 id="ii-the-facts-regarding-the-october-2-accident">II.

October 12 Call</h5> <ul> <li>NHTSA regulator called Cruise employee and informed them that NHTSA was planning Preliminary Evaluation; employee sent the following to Cruise NHTSA team: <ul> <li>&#34;She shared that there was a lot of consternation in the front office about last week&#39;s incident. It is going to be a pretty broad investigation into how vehicles react to pedestrians out in the street and people in the roadway. But questions about last week&#39;s incident will be included in the IR questions and analysis. I offered an additional briefing about last week&#39;s incident, but she said that we were quite upfront and shared the video and told them everything they need to know.&#34;</li> <li>&#34;it [is] difficult to believe that they could find fault with our reaction to the pedestrian in Panini [Panini is the name of the specific AV] that would extend beyond asking us additional questions in a follow-up…&#34;</li> </ul></li> </ul> <h5 id="b-october-13-meeting">b. October 13 Meeting</h5> <ul> <li>&#34;Despite the severe consequences that could result from a PE, including a recall, Cruise’s Chief Legal Officer and Senior Vice President of Government Affairs did not attend&#34;</li> <li>From meeting agenda: &#34;We’re just a little confused by this. We met with you about the Panini incident last week, and the team didn’t express any remaining concerns about it, even when asked if you had any additional concerns. Was there really remaining concern about AV behavior regarding Panini? If yes, why did they not request another briefing? We’ve been extremely cooperative with the Agency and have always provided information that the agency requested. What will be gained by this escalation that we are not already providing? Offer briefing on any of these topics in lieu of PE.&#34;</li> <li>Also planned to state: &#34;Regarding last week’s incident we briefed the agency within hours of the event, provided video, and offered repeatedly to share additional information, including around the topic of pedestrian safety broadly. None was requested, which makes us question the motivations behind opening a PE. PEs are punitive means to gather information, and are reputationally harmful, particularly in a nascent industry.&#34;</li> </ul> <h5 id="c-october-16-pe">c.

NHTSA 1-Day Report</h5> <ul> <li>Original draft forwarded from paralegal to Deputy General Counsel <abbr title="Deputy General Counsel">Alicia Fenrick</abbr>, Director of Communications Erik Moser, and Managing Legal Counsel <abbr title="Managing Legal Counsel">Andrew Rubenstein</abbr>: &#34;A Cruise autonomous vehicle (&#34;AV&#34;), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on southbound Cyril Magnin Street at the intersection with Market Street. A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of Market Street across from the vehicles and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed through the AV&#39;s lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in the adjacent lane. Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, launching the pedestrian in front of the AV. The AV braked aggressively but, shortly thereafter, made contact with the pedestrian. This caused no damage to the AV. The driver of the Nissan Sentra left the scene shortly after the collision. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene. The pedestrian was transported by EMS.&#34; <ul> <li>LGTM&#39;d [approved] by <abbr title="Deputy General Counsel">Fenrick</abbr> and Moser; <abbr title="Managing Legal Counsel">Rubenstein</abbr> said &#34;the GA folks have suggested some additional edits&#34;, which included adding that the &#34;completely&#34; pass through AV&#39;s lane of travel, changing &#34;launching&#34; to &#34;deflecting&#34;, and removing &#34;this caused no damage to the AV&#34;; no discussion of possible inclusion of pullover and dragging</li> </ul></li> <li>Cruise employee who established NHTSA reporting system believed that full details, including pullover and dragging, should&#39;ve been included, but they were on vacation at the time</li> <li>In later, <b>10-24</b>, employee Q&amp;A on DMV suspension order, an employee asked &#34;Why was the decision made not to include the post-collision pull-over in the written report to the NHTSA? At least, this seems like it must have been an intentional decision, not an accidental oversight.&#34; <ul> <li><abbr title="Managing Legal Counsel">Rubenstein</abbr> drafted this prepared response for <abbr title="Deputy General Counsel">Fenrick</abbr>: &#34;The purpose of the NHTSA reporting requirement is to notify the agency of the occurrence of crashes. Consistent with that objective and our usual practice, our report notified NHTSA that the crash had occurred. Additionally, we had already met with NHTSA, including showing the full video to them, prior to submission of the report. That meeting was the result of our proactive outreach: we immediately reached out to NHTSA after the incident to set up a meeting to discuss with them. Our team met with NHTSA in the morning following the incident, including showing the full video to NHTSA. We then submitted the report and sent a copy of the full video later that afternoon.&#34;</li> <li><abbr title="Deputy General Counsel">Fenrick</abbr> LGTM&#39;d the above, but the response ended up not being given</li> </ul></li> <li>Quinn Emanuel notes, &#34;It is difficult to square this rationale with the plain language of the NHTSA regulation itself, which requires “a written description of the pre-crash, crash, *and post-crash details….*” (emphasis added)&#34;</li> </ul> <h5 id="b-nhtsa-10-day-report">b.

Conclusions Regarding Cruise’s Communications with the DMV</h4> <ul> <li><abbr title="Chief Legal Officer">Bleich</abbr>: &#34;[T]he main concern from DMV was that our vehicle did not distinguish between a person and another object under its carriage originally, and so went into an MRC. Second, they felt that we should have emphasized the AV’s second movement right away in our first meeting. In fact, in the first meeting -- although we showed them the full video -- they (and we) were focused on confirming that we were not operating unsafely before the collision and we did not cause the initial contact with the pedestrian. They did not focus on the end of the video and -- because they did not raise it -- our team did not actively address it&#34;</li> <li><abbr title="CEO, CTO, President, and co-founder">Vogt</abbr>: &#34;I am very much struggling with the fact that our GA team did not volunteer the info about the secondary movement with the DMV, and that during the handling of the event I remember getting inconsistent reports as to what was shared. At some point bad judgment call must have been made, and I want to know how that happened.&#34;</li> <li><abbr title="Chief Legal Officer">Bleich</abbr>: &#34;ACP -- I share your concern that the second movement wasn’t part of the discussion. I don’t know that there was a deliberate decision by the team that was doing the briefings. I believe they were still in the mode from the previous evening where they were pushing back against an assumption that we either were responsible for hitting the pedestrian or that we did not react fast enough when the pedestrian fell into our path. But as I’ve probed for basic information about what we shared and when I’ve had the same frustration that dates get pushed together or details are left out. I don’t know if this is deliberate, or people are simply having difficulty recalling exactly what they did or said during the immediate aftermath of that event.&#34;</li> <li>&#34;these Slacks convey that the three senior leaders of the company – the CEO, CLO, and COO – were not actively engaged in the regulatory response for the worst accident in Cruise’s history.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS</h2> <ul> <li>&#34;By the time Cruise employees from legal, government affairs, operations, and systems integrity met with regulators and other government officials on October 3, they knew or should have known that the Cruise AV had engaged in a pullover maneuver and dragged the pedestrian underneath the vehicle for approximately 20 feet&#34; <ul> <li>&#34;Cruise’s passive, non-transparent approach to its disclosure obligations to its regulators reflects a basic misunderstanding of what regulatory authorities need to know and when they need to know it&#34;</li> </ul></li> <li>&#34;Although neither Cruise nor Quinn Emanuel can definitively establish that NHTSA or DMV were shown the entirety of the Full Video, including the pullover maneuver and dragging, the weight of the evidence indicates that Cruise attempted to play the Full Video in these meetings; however, internet connectivity issues impeded or prevented these regulators from seeing the video clearly or fully.&#34; <ul> <li>&#34;in the face of these internet connectivity issues that caused the video to freeze or black- or white-out, Cruise employees remained silent, failing to ensure that the regulators understood what they likely could not see – that the Cruise AV had moved forward again after the initial impact, dragging the pedestrian underneath the vehicle&#34;</li> </ul></li> <li>&#34;Even if, as some Cruise employees stated, they were unaware of the pullover maneuver and pedestrian dragging at the time of certain regulatory briefings (which itself raises other concerns), Cruise leadership and other personnel were informed about the full details of the October 2 Accident during the day on October 3 and should have taken corrective action.&#34;</li> <li>&#34;While Cruise employees clearly demonstrated mistakes of judgment and failure to appreciate the importance of transparency and accountability, based on Quinn Emanuel’s review to date, the evidence does not establish that Cruise employees sought to intentionally mislead government regulators about the October 2 Accident, including the pullover maneuver and pedestrian dragging&#34;</li> <li>&#34;Cruise’s senior leadership repeatedly failed to understand the importance of public trust and accountability&#34;</li> <li>&#34;Cruise’s response to the October 2 Accident reflects deficient leadership at the highest levels of the Company—including among some members of the C-Suite, legal, governmental affairs, systems integrity, and communications teams—that led to a lack of coordination, mistakes of judgment, misapprehension of regulatory requirements and expectations, and inconsistent disclosures and discussions of material facts at critical meetings with regulators and other government officials. The end result has been a profound loss of public and governmental trust and a suspension of Cruise’s business in California&#34; <ul> <li>&#34;There was no captain of the ship. No single person or team within Cruise appears to have taken responsibility to ensure a coordinated and fully transparent disclosure of all material facts regarding the October 2 Accident to the DMV, NHTSA, and other governmental officials. Various members of the SLT who had the responsibility for managing the response to this Accident were missing-in-action for key meetings, both preparatory and/or with the regulators. This left each Cruise team to prepare for the meetings independently, with different employees attending different regulatory meetings, and with no senior Cruise official providing overall direction to ensure consistency in approach and disclosure of all material facts.&#34;</li> <li>&#34;There was no demonstrated understanding of regulatory expectations by certain senior Cruise management or line employees&#34;</li> <li>&#34;Cruise’s deficient regulatory response to the October 2 Accident reflects preexisting weaknesses in the Company, including ineffectual Cruise leadership with respect to certain senior leaders. Two out of many examples illustrate these weaknesses.&#34; <ul> <li>No coordinated or rigorous process for what needed to be discussed with DMV, NHTSA, etc., nor did leadership or employees in meetings take steps to ensure they were informed of what had happened before the meetings (such as asking their direct reports for updates); &#34;To underscore Cruise’s lack of coordination in its briefings to regulators and other government officials on October 3, senior leadership never convened a meeting of the various teams to discuss and learn how these meetings went, what questions were asked, and what discussions took place. Had they done so, they should have realized that in only one of the four meetings did government officials ask questions about the pullover maneuver and pedestrian dragging, requiring corrective action&#34;</li> <li>&#34;Cruise lawyers displayed a lack of understanding of what information must be communicated to NHTSA in these reports, and misapprehended the NHTSA requirement ... Cruise leadership gave a paralegal the primary responsibility for preparing and filing such reports with the Cruise legal department exercising little oversight&#34;</li> </ul></li> </ul></li> </ul> <h2 id="vi-recommendations">VI. RECOMMENDATIONS</h2> <ul> <li>New senior leadership</li> <li>Consider creating a dedicated, cross-disciplinary Regulatory Team which understands regulations, has experience dealing with regulators, and proactively improves Cruise&#39;s regulatory reporting processes and systems, reporting directly to CEO with board oversight</li> <li>Training for remaining senior leadership</li> <li>Create a streamlined Crisis Management Team <ul> <li>200 people in a war room can&#39;t manage a crisis; also need to have a &#34;captain&#34; or someone in charge</li> </ul></li> <li>Review incident response protocol and ensure that it is followed</li> <li>&#34;There is a need to reform the governmental affairs, legal, and public communications functions within Cruise&#34;</li> <li>&#34;Cruise should file its reports about any accident involving a Cruise vehicle with regulators by having a designated Chief Safety Officer or senior engineer, as well as a regulatory lawyer, within Cruise review and approve the filing of each report&#34;</li> </ul> <h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2> <ul> <li>The report by Exponent, mentioned above, is included in the Appendix. It is mostly redacted, although there is a lot of interesting non-redacted content, such as &#34;the collision detection system incorrectly identified the pedestrian as being located on the side of the AV at the time of impact instead of in front of the AV and thus determined the collision to be a side impact ... The determination by the ADS that a side collision occurred, and not a frontal collision, led to a less severe collision response being executed and resulted in the AV performing the subsequent outermost lane stop maneuver instead of an emergency stop ... The root cause of the AV’s post-collision movement, after the initial brief stop, was the inaccurate determination by the ADS that a side collision had occurred ... the inaccuracy of the object track considered by the collision detection system and the resulting disparity between this track and the pedestrian’s actual position, the ADS failed to accurately determine the location of the pedestrian at the time of impact and while the pedestrian was underneath the vehicle&#34;</li> </ul> <h2 id="back-to-danluu-com">back to danluu.com</h2> <p>I don&#39;t have much to add to this. I certainly have opinions, but I don&#39;t work in automotive and haven&#39;t dug into it enough to feel informed enough to add my own thoughts. In one discussion I had with a retired exec who used to work on autonomous vehicles, on incident management at Cruise vs. tech companies Twitter or Slack, the former exec said:</p> <blockquote> <p>You get good at incidents given a steady stream of incidents of varying severity if you have to handle the many small ones. You get terrible at incidents if you can cover up the small ones until a big one happens. So it&#39;s not only funny but natural for internet companies to do it better than AV companies I think</p> </blockquote> <p>On the &#34;minimal risk condition&#34; pullover maneuver, this exec said:</p> <blockquote> <p>These pullover maneuvers are magic pixie dust making AVs safe: if something happens, we&#39;ll do a safety pullover maneuver</p> </blockquote> <p>And on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231024184429/https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2023/a-detailed-review-of-the-recent-sf-hit-and-run-incident/">the now-deleted blog post, &#34;A detailed review of the recent SF hit-and-run incident&#34;</a>, the exec said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Their mentioning of regulatory ADAS test cases does not inspire confidence; these tests are shit. But it&#39;s a bit unfair on my part since of course they would mention these tests, it doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have better ones</p> </blockquote> <p>On how regulations and processes making safety-critical industries safer and what you&#39;d do if you cared about safety vs. the recommendations in the report, this exec said</p> <blockquote> <p>[Dan,] you care about things being done right. People in these industries care about compliance. Anything &#34;above the state of the art&#34; buys you zero brownie points. eg for [X], any [Y] ATM are not required at all. [We] are better at [X] than most and it does nothing for compliance ... OTOH if a terrible tool or process exists that does nothing good but is considered &#34;the state of the art&#34; / is mandated by a standard, you sure as hell are going to use it</p> </blockquote> <p> <b><a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/freshpaint/bfe56523-bff4-4ca3-936b-0ba15fb4e572?utm_source=dl"> If you&#39;re looking for work, Freshpaint is hiring a recruiter, Software Engineers, and a Support Engineer</a></b>. I&#39;m in an investor, so you should consider my potential bias, but they seem to have found product-market fit and are growing extremely quickly (revenue-wise)</p> <p><i> Thanks to an anonymous former AV exec, Justin Blank, and 5d22b for comments/corrections/discussion.</i></p> <h2 id="appendix-a-physical-hardware-curiosity">Appendix: a physical hardware curiosity</h2> <p>One question I had for the exec mentioned above, which wasn&#39;t relevant to this case, but is something I&#39;ve wondered about for a while, is why the AVs that I see driving don&#39;t have upgraded tires and brakes. You can get much shorter stopping distances from cars that aren&#39;t super heavy by upgrading their tires and brakes, but the AVs I&#39;ve seen have not had this done.</p> <p>In this case, we can&#39;t do the exact comparison from an upgraded vehicle to the base vehicle because the vehicle dynamics data was redacted from section 3.3.3, table 9, and figure 40 of the appendix, but it&#39;s common knowledge that the simplest safety upgrade you can make on a car is upgrading the tires (and, if relevant, the brakes). One could argue that this isn&#39;t worth the extra running cost, or the effort (for the low-performance cars that I tend to see converted into AVs, getting stopping distances equivalent to a sporty vehicle would generally require modifying the wheel well so that wider tires don&#39;t rub) but, as an outsider, I&#39;d be curious to know what the cost benefit trade-off on shorter stopping distances is.</p> <p>They hadn&#39;t considered it before, but thought that better tires and brake would make a difference in a lot of other cases and prevent accients and explained the lack of this upgrade by:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think if you have a combination of &#34;we want to base AV on commodity cars&#34; and &#34;I am an algorithms guy&#34; mindset you will not go look at what the car should be.</p> </blockquote> <p>And, to be clear, upgraded tires and brakes would not have changed the outcome in this case. The timeline from the Exponent report has</p> <ul> <li><strong>-2.9s</strong>: contact between Nissan and Pedestrian</li> <li><strong>-2s</strong>: Pedestrian track dropped</li> <li><strong>-1.17s</strong>: Pedestrian beings separating from Nissan</li> <li><strong>-0.81s</strong>: [redacted]</li> <li><strong>-0.78s</strong>: Pedestrian lands in AV&#39;s travel lane</li> <li><strong>-0.41s</strong>: Collision checker predicts collision</li> <li><strong>-0.25s</strong>: AV starts sending braking and steering commands (<code>19.1 mph</code>)</li> <li><strong>0s</strong>: collision (<code>18.6 mph</code>)</li> </ul> <p>Looking at actual accelerometer data from a car with upgraded tires and brakes, stopping time from <code>19.1mph</code> for that car was around <code>0.8s</code>, so this wouldn&#39;t have made much difference in this case. If brakes aren&#39;t pre-charged before attempting to brake, there&#39;s significant latency when initially braking, such that <code>0.25s</code> isn&#39;t enough for almost any braking to have occurred, which we can see from the speed only being <code>0.5mph</code> slower in this case.</p> <p>Another comment from the exec is that, while a human might react to the collision at <code>-2.9s</code> and slow down or stop, &#34;scene understanding&#34; as a human might do it is non-existent in most or perhaps all AVs, so it&#39;s unsurprising that the AV doesn&#39;t react until the pedestrian is in the AV&#39;s path, whereas a human, if they noticed the accident in the adjacent lane, would likely drastically slow down or stop. The exec was also not surprised by the <code>530ms</code> latency between the pedestrian landing in the AV&#39;s path and the AV starting to attempt to apply the brakes although, as a lay person, I found <code>530ms</code> surprising.</p> <p>On the advantage of AVs and ADAS, as implemented today, compared to a human who&#39;s looking in the right place, paying attention, etc., the exec said</p> <blockquote> <p>They mainly never get tired or drink and hopefully also run in that terrible driver&#39;s car in the next lane. For [current systems], it&#39;s reliability and not peak performance that makes it useful. Peak performance is definitely not superhuman but subhuman</p> </blockquote> </div></div>
