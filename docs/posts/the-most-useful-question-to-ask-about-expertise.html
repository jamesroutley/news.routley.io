    <h1>The Most Useful Question to Ask About Expertise</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2022/07/most_useful_question_expertise.jpg" alt="The Most Useful Question to Ask About Expertise"><p>One of the nice things about reading a lot of expertise research is that you learn to pay <em>very</em> special attention to questions of the form &#x201C;what differentiates a top &lt;x&gt; from one who is merely good?&#x201D; So, for instance, you should listen carefully when a high performance salesperson is asked &#x201C;what differentiates a top salesperson from one who is merely good?&#x201D; and &#x201C;what would an expert do here that a novice wouldn&#x2019;t?&#x201D; and also &#x201C;what mistake would you have made here, were you less experienced?&#x201D;</p><p>The technical term for these questions is that you are &#x2018;probing for expert-novice differences&#x2019;, but the overall approach is known as the &#x2018;expert-novice research paradigm&#x2019; within the expertise literature. There are some criticisms levelled against this research approach &#x2014; which we&#x2019;ll get to in a bit &#x2014; but it is, broadly speaking, a highly effective tool for getting at the heart of expertise.</p><p>I want to talk a little about why this approach works, and why you might want to ask these questions. To do this, I&#x2019;ll have to explain the nature of expertise in a specific skill domain.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll illustrate with one in-depth example.</p><p>About a week ago, I was listening to the Acquired LP podcast, when I heard host Ben Gilbert ask pricing expert Patrick Campbell: &#x201C;For someone who&#x2019;s never been around an A-plus growth person, and they kinda feel like a lot of people that they&#x2019;ve worked with are good &#x2026; <em>how do you know?</em>&#x201D;</p>
