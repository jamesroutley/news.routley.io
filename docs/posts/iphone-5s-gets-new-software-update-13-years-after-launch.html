    <h1>iPhone 5s Gets New Software Update 13 Years After Launch</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div role="main" id="maincontent"><article expanded="true"><div><div data-io-article-url="/2026/01/26/iphone-5s-software-update/"><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-releases-ios-26-2-1/">Alongside iOS 26.2.1</a>, Apple today released an updated version of iOS 12 for devices that are still running that operating system update, eight years after the software was first released.</p>

<p>According to Apple&#39;s release notes for the update, iOS 12.5.8 extends the certificate required for features like iMessage, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and device activation, so they will continue to work after January 2027.</p>
<p>Originally, certificate-limited functions like device activation would have ceased when the certificate expired, but now key features on the two older iPhones will continue to work in the years to come.</p>
<p>Prior to now, the ‌iPhone‌ 5s and ‌iPhone‌ 6 last received software updates in January 2023, when Apple released important security fixes.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-iphone-security-updates-five-year-minimum/">has publicly committed</a> to providing a minimum of five years of security updates for an ‌iPhone‌ from the time that it launches, but it often offers vulnerability fixes for an even longer period of time.</p>
<p>The ‌iPhone‌ 6s, for example, was released 11 years ago, but it received a security update in September 2025 with the launch of iOS 15.8.5. The device received an iOS 15.8.6 update just today, adding the same certificate extension.</p>
<p>Apple also released new versions of iOS 18 and iOS 16.</p>
