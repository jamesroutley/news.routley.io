<p>TuneD is a system tuning service for Linux. It:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        monitors connected devices using the <code>udev</code> device manager
    </li>
    <li>
        tunes system settings according to a selected profile
    </li>
    <li>
      supports various types of configuration like <code>sysctl</code>,
      <code>sysfs</code>, 
        or kernel boot command line parameters, which are integrated
        in a plug-in architecture
    </li>
    <li>
        supports hot plugging of devices and can be controlled from
        the command line or through D-Bus, so it can be easily integrated
        into existing administering solutions: for example, with Cockpit
    </li>
    <li>
        can be run in no-daemon mode with limited functionality (for example, no
        support for D-Bus, <code>udev</code>, tuning of newly created
        processes, and so on) for systems with reduced resources
    </li>
    <li>
        stores all its configuration cleanly in one place – in the
        TuneD profile – instead of having configuration on multiple places 
        and in custom scripts
    </li>
</ul>

<p>TuneD profiles:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>can be defined hierarchically, which reduces duplication 
        and simplifies maintenance:</p>
        <p>More specialized profiles can inherit generic profiles and just
        change what is needed instead of duplicating the code.
        For example, you can built a generic profile for HTTP server upon
        the <code>throughput-performance</code> profile and later create two 
        more specialized profiles for the Apache server and the Nginx server, 
        basing both profiles on the generic HTTP server profile.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>support full rollback:</p>
        <p>The system can be easily returned to the
        state before the profile was applied. This can be handy for testing,
        benchmarking, experimenting, and so on.
        For example, you can set up a <code>cron</code> rule 
        to apply a certain profile during business hours and 
        a different one at night. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>include a number of predefined profiles for common use cases:</p>
        <p>For example, presets for high throughput, low latency, or powersave
        are distributed. Profiles optimizing performance for various products
        like SAP, dBase servers, and so on are also provided, and it is possible
        to fully customize them.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
