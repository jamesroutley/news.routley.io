    <h1>OpenAI Pleads It Can&#39;t Make Money Without Using Copyrighted Materials for Free</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="incArticle"><h2>&#34;It would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials.&#34;</h2><h2>Please Sir</h2><p>OpenAI is begging the British Parliament to allow it to use copyrighted works because it&#39;s supposedly &#34;impossible&#34; for the company to train its artificial intelligence models — and continue growing its <a href="https://qz.com/openai-is-set-to-see-its-valuation-at-80-billion-makin-1850950928">multi-billion-dollar business</a> — without them.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/01/07/openai-warns-copyright-crackdown-could-doom-chatgpt/"><em>The Telegraph</em> reports</a>, the AI firm said in a filing submitted to a House of Lords subcommittee that using only content from the public domain would be insufficient to train the kind of large language models (LLMs) it&#39;s building, suggesting that the company must therefore be allowed to use copyrighted material.</p><p>&#34;Because copyright today covers virtually every sort of human expression — including blog posts, photographs, forum posts, scraps of software code, and government documents — it would be impossible to train today&#39;s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials,&#34; the company wrote in the evidence filing. &#34;Limiting training data to public domain books and drawings created more than a century ago might yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today&#39;s citizens.&#34;</p><p>OpenAI went on to insist in the document, submitted before the House of Lords&#39; communications and digital committee, that it complies with copyright laws and that the company believes &#34;legally copyright law does not forbid training.&#34;</p><h2>Rank and File</h2><p>There&#39;s a growing chorus of interested parties who strongly disagree with OpenAI&#39;s assertion that it&#39;s chill and legal to use copyrighted work to train AI.</p><p>Just a few weeks ago, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html"><em>New York Times</em> sued OpenAI</a> and Microsoft, its biggest investor, for profiting from allegedly &#34;massive copyright infringement, commercial exploitation and misappropriation&#34; of the paper&#39;s intellectual property.</p><p>The paper of record is far from alone in its legal overtures against OpenAI. A few months prior, the <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/authors-guild-to-add-microsoft-in-its-lawsuit-against-openai/">Authors Guild sued the firm</a> on behalf of some of the biggest names in fiction — including John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, Jonathan Franzen, David Baldacci, and George R.R. Martin — over objections to those writers&#39; work being used to train ChatGPT.</p><p>Without using copyrighted work, OpenAI &#34;would have a vastly different commercial product,&#34; Rachel Geman, one of the attorneys in the guild&#39;s class action suit, said in a <a href="https://authorsguild.org/news/ag-and-authors-file-class-action-suit-against-openai/">press release about the filing</a>. As such, the company&#39;s &#34;decision to copy authors&#39; works, done without offering any choices or providing any compensation, threatens the role and livelihood of writers as a whole.&#34;</p><p>On OpenAI&#39;s end, the company claims that it&#39;s seeking to broker new publisher partnerships, <em>The Telegraph</em> reports. All the same, it&#39;s hard to imagine every newspaper, website, or publishing house accepting such terms wholesale, much less <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-analytics-books-shutdown">independent writers</a> who rely on their copyrights to <a href="https://futurism.com/ai-writing-scammers-amazon">make a living</a>.</p><p><strong>More on authors and AI:</strong> <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-companies-hiring-authors-poets-fix-writing"><em>AI Companies Desperately Hiring Authors and Poets to Fix Their Crappy Writing</em></a></p></div></div>
