    <h1>Write the damn code</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article data-namespace=""><div><div><header></header><p>Here&#39;s some popular programming advice these days:</p><blockquote><p>Learn to decompose problems into smaller chunks, be specific about what you want, pick the right AI model for the task, and <strong>iterate on your prompts</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Don&#39;t do this.</p><p>I mean, &#34;learn to decompose the problem&#34; — sure. &#34;Iterate on your prompts&#34; — not so much. Write the actual code instead:</p><ul><li>Ask AI for an initial version and then refactor it to match your expectations.</li><li>Write the initial version yourself and ask AI to review and improve it.</li><li>Write the critical parts and ask AI to do the rest.</li><li>Write an outline of the code and ask AI to fill the missing parts.</li></ul><p>You probably see the pattern now. Get involved with the code, don&#39;t leave it all to AI.</p><p>If, given the prompt, AI does the job perfectly on first or second iteration — fine. Otherwise, stop refining the prompt. Go write some code, then get back to the AI. You&#39;ll get much better results.</p><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong: this is not anti-AI advice. Use it, by all means. Use it a lot if you want to. But don&#39;t fall into the trap of endless back-and-forth prompt refinement, trying to get the perfect result from AI by &#34;programming in English&#34;. It&#39;s an imprecise, slow and terribly painful way to get things done.</p><p>Get your hands dirty. Write the code. It&#39;s what you are good at.</p><p>You are a software engineer. Don&#39;t become a prompt refiner.</p><p><a href="https://antonz.org/subscribe/">★ Subscribe</a> to keep up with new posts.</p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
