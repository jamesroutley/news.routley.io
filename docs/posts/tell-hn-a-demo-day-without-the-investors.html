    <h1>Tell HN: A Demo Day without the investors</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When Harry (my co-founder) and I started Trevor.io we obviously needed customers.  We&#39;d often bonded over Paul Graham&#39;s &#34;Do Things That Don&#39;t Scale&#34;, so it was a no-brainer that every month, like clockwork, we&#39;d get on that â‚¬50 Ryanair flight to London, to spend a week pitching potential customers / partners / anyone who would listen.  We tried as best we could to rotate which lucky friend or family members&#39; sofa we would be sleeping on each time, so as not to out-stay our welcome.</p><p>One event that we ended up doing again and again was called TechHub Tuesday Demo Night.  It was an epic monthly event (first Tuesday of every month) hosted by the most sought after startup co-working space on London&#39;s famous &#34;Silicon Roundabout&#34; (yes, us English can&#39;t quite fill a valley yet with our startup scene, but we sure can fill a roundabout!).  The event was an opportunity for up-and-coming startups to show (not tell) what they had built, and get instant feedback from the community.  Importantly, you had to have built something (an app / website / platform / etc.) and, unlike competing events, it wasn&#39;t about trying to pitch for investment.  It was a welcoming, enthusiastic audience of fellow entrepreneurs, builders and product lovers.  Pitching your product here was always a buzz.</p><p>Unfortunately, like many other great ventures, TechHub London was one of the unlucky victims of Covid 19.  In the summer of 2020 they slipped into administration, and with it TechHub Tuesday Demo Night.  We&#39;ve very much missed it - both presenting and attending - so we have decided to do something about it.</p><p>We are pumped to announce that next Tuesday we are launching our very own Tuesday Demo Day with a twist:</p><p>- it will be 100% virtual,
- and 100% free.</p><p>This means that you can join us from the comfort of your couch.  Bring a beverage of your choice and be ready to be give our startups the feedback and advice they need to take themselves to the next level.</p><p>We would be absolutely delighted if you would join us (<a href="https://hopin.com/events/trevor-demo-day-global" rel="nofollow">https://hopin.com/events/trevor-demo-day-global</a>).</p></div></div></div>
