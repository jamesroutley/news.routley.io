    <h1>ChatGPT: Fear Litany</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I apologize for the technical glitch that is preventing the complete Litany Against Fear from being displayed. It appears that the Litany Against Fear from Frank Herbert&#39;s &#34;Dune&#34; is getting cut off after the initial words. The complete quote, which for some reason isn&#39;t fully rendering here, discusses how fear is the mind-killer and the little-death, and goes on to express a resolve to face one&#39;s fear and let it pass through, so that only the observer remains. It&#39;s a powerful message about confronting and overcoming fear, a central theme of the novel.</p></div></div></div></div>
