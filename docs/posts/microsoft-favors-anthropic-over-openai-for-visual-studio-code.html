Sources familiar with Microsoft’s developer plans tell me that the company has been instructing its own developers to use Claude Sonnet 4 in recent months.</p><p>“Based on internal benchmarks, Claude Sonnet 4 is our recommended model for GitHub Copilot,” said Julia Liuson, head of Microsoft’s developer division, in an internal email in June. While that guidance was issued ahead of the GPT-5 release, I understand Microsoft’s model guidance hasn’t changed.</p><p>Microsoft is also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/776853/microsoft-ai-training-capacity-investments-in-house-models">making “significant investments” in training</a> its own AI models. “We’re also going to be making significant investments in our own cluster. So today, MAI-1-preview was only trained on 15,000 H100s, a tiny cluster in the grand scheme of things,” said Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman, in an employee-only town hall last week.</p><p>Microsoft is also reportedly planning to use Anthropic’s AI models for some features in its Microsoft 365 apps soon.<em> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-buy-ai-anthropic-shift-openai?rc=r6gev9">The Information</a></em> reports that the Microsoft 365 Copilot will be “partly powered by Anthropic models,” after Microsoft found that some of these models outperformed OpenAI in Excel and PowerPoint.</p><p>OpenAI and Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776884/openai-microsoft-mou">announced a new deal</a> last week that could clear the way for the AI startup’s initial public offering. Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703578/microsoft-openai-investment-partnership-1-billion-azure-artificial-general-intelligence-agi">since 2019</a>, and has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/688964/microsoft-openai-relationship-notepad">complex revenue sharing agreement</a> in place. Microsoft now allows OpenAI to lean on rival cloud providers, and is expected to reveal further details about the “next phase” of its OpenAI relationship soon.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/778641/microsoft-visual-studio-code-anthropic-claude-4#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div>
