    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div> <div>    <h3>Hello! <em>Welcome to my net home.</em></h3> <h4>I don&#39;t know if you have a website or not <em>but let me tell you something...</em> writing an intro is hard.</h4> <p>Instead of putting up flashy pictures all over the place or nothing worth reading I have decided to make a page that will explain a little about myself. <em>Anyway, since you were brave enough to enter here’s a little about me:</em></p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td>搜尋引擎網站!</td> <td> Yahoo! </td> </tr><tr> <td>Hobbies:</td> <td> everything including daydreaming. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Friends:</td> <td> I’ve swapped friends about a hundred times since the last major update </td> </tr> <tr> <td>What I’m doing at the moment (Not Literally!):</td> <td> I’m collecting rainbows and I play the fool! Are you smiling yet?? --- I hope so! </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Quotes:</td> <td> “Is a Sunset . . . The End or a Begining?”. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>I never planned on making a page. However I need something to show for all the time I spend on this computer. So why not?? Well that’s all I can think of for now. Be sure to visit again, this page is always changing!</p> <p>I wish all of you happy net surfing!!</p> </div> </div>     </div></div>
