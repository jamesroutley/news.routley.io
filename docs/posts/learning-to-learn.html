    <h1>Learning to Learn</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article"> <p>In the past 3 years, I’ve run over 300 interviews.  On average, I meet someone
new every 3-4 days to understand if they’re the right fit for an early-stage
startup.</p>
<p>I especially like capping interviews with an open-ended question that really
lets great candidates shine. One of my favorite now-retired questions is,
<a href="https://www.safegraph.com/blog/why-the-famous-peter-thiel-interview-question-is-so-predictive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in Thielian fashion</a>:
“What’s something you’ve learned that you believe gives you an edge - something
that you’re almost surprised more people don’t know about?”</p>
<p>One of the all-time best answers I heard was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you’re starting something new, the most important thing is knowing what to learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Followed by unpacking an optimal learning flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Very quickly identify what the foundational knowledge is.</li>
<li>Build a personal curriculum to become an expert and avoid the trap of
the <a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">expert beginner</a>.</li>
<li>Sprint hard the first 15-20 hours to impress initial memory, then decelerate to a
more regular pace.</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 and #2 are common structured approaches to learning, whereas #3 is a
relatively novel interpretation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spaced repetition</a>.
But at a more meta level, the unexpected takeaway is the vast majority of people
likely haven’t updated their mental model for learning in decades. (Stop and
think for a moment on the last time you did this.)</p>
<p>Learning to learn is extremely high leverage. 40 hours at 25% efficiency does is
the same as 12.5 hours at 80% efficiency. And it turns out that being
<em>productively honest</em> is one of the most effective and kindest things you can do
for yourself.</p> </article></div>
