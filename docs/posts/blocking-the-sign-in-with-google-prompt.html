<p>On many websites that require login, those annoying Google login prompts appear:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/gY1Yj.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/gY1Yj.png" alt="&#34;Sign in to unlock deals and discounts!&#34; popup"/></a></p>
<p>There are several tutorials on the Internet on how to avoid this, for example, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/735152/how-to-turn-off-the-sign-in-with-google-prompt-on-websites/" rel="noreferrer">this one on How-To Geek</a>, which suggest disabling an option in the Google account.

<p>Note, that this only happens with Firefox (110.0.1 (64-bit), AdBlocker ultimate v 3.7.21 installed); if I use the Brave browser (version 1.49.120 Chromium: 111.0.5563.64 (Official Build) (64-bit)), which is known to block ads by default, they are not displayed. I&#39;m on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#Ubuntu_22.04_LTS_(Jammy_Jellyfish)" rel="noreferrer">Ubuntu 22.04.2</a> LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) with Linux kernel 5.19.0-35-generic x86_64.</p>
