    <h1>Working with A Large Code Base</h1>

<p>
The bigger a code base, the more tooling we need.
Think about Hack at Meta, Basel or Protocol Buffers at Google, and Kafka at LinkedIn.
Big tech is big on tooling.
Their tooling.
It helps them scale.</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/08/13/navigating-cities-of-code-with-norris-numbers/">Navigating Cities of Code</a>, the author puts forward the idea that at successively larger LOC, a code base requires us to adopt more sophisticated techniques and practices.
Documentation, testing, and expressive strong static types are some concrete examples <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a>.</p>
<p>
The idea is great <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>, but some of the techniques and practices listed (for working with code) are ambiguous, and the author’s personal experience.
If we just observe the industry, I think we can all see that tooling is hugely important, and that it should be listed there too.</p>
<p>
At one end of the scale, big tech has entire departments dedicated to (internal) tooling.
A significant part of their organisation is dedicated to improving software development for all of their organisation.
On the other side of the spectrum, it’s common for lots of smaller shops to have at least a platform team.</p>
<p>
Day to day, I think we can all take inspiration from this observation to build-out more modest tooling, more frequently.</p>
