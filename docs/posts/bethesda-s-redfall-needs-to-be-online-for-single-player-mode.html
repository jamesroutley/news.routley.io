<p>Bethesda&#39;s upcoming supernatural shooter <em>Redfall</em> will require &#34;a persistent online connection,&#34; even for the single-player experience. That&#39;s according to <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/redfall-faq">an FAQ posted by Bethesda last week</a>, which also confirms that players will need an active Bethesda.net account to play the game.</p>
<p>Many modern single-player games require an online check-in (or even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/modern-warfare-ii-players-will-need-to-provide-a-unique-phone-number/">a text message confirmation</a>) the first time they&#39;re launched, and some require periodic online anti-piracy checks. Games that require a <em>persistent</em> online connection for solo play are rarer, though <a href="https://www.thefpsreview.com/2020/04/01/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-campaign-remastered-doesnt-have-multiplayer-but-its-always-online-anyway/">significant exceptions</a> do <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/12/ubisofts-for-honor-is-an-always-online-experience-even-single-player/">exist</a>.</p>
<p>While Bethesda has not responded to a request for comment on the decision, game publishers often cite piracy or cheating concerns as reasons to require players to connect to the Internet for solo play. In 2013, for instance, Blizzard&#39;s Mike Morhaime <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/07/blizzard-co-founder-addresses-players-diablo-iii-concerns/">said</a> an online connection was &#34;critical to the long-term integrity of the game experience&#34; for <em>Diablo III</em> and its controversial (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/diablo-3-to-permanently-remove-its-auction-houses-in-march-2014/">later removed</a>) real-money auction house.</p>
<p>But such online requirements can cause problems when the servers inevitably face problems or go down, as we saw recently with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/server-issues-lock-gran-turismo-7-owners-out-of-single-player-races/"><em>Gran Turismo 7</em>&#39;s extended outage</a> and less recently with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/03/clogged-streets-simcity-launch-plagued-by-server-problems/"><em>SimCity</em>&#39;s massive server congestion issues</a> at launch. Such requirements can also be a major hindrance to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/modern-gaming-is-a-challenge-for-those-without-high-speed-internet/">players without stable Internet service</a>, including those in rural or international settings.</p>
<p>The always-online requirement from Microsoft-owned Bethesda also brings to mind Microsoft&#39;s initial decision to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/06/microsoft-details-xbox-one-used-games-always-online-and-privacy-policies/">require daily online check-ins</a> to play games on the Xbox One. While Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/06/rumor-microsoft-set-to-reverse-controversial-game-licensing-policies/">famously reversed that decision</a> before the console launched, the damage was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/06/xbox-one-eighty-microsoft-fails-to-sell-the-future-retreats-to-the-past/">largely already done</a> from a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/microsoft-xbox-one-licensing-plan-was-a-little-ahead-of-consumers/">public messaging perspective</a>.</p>
<p>These decisions aren&#39;t set in stone, though. Zombie shooter <em>Back 4 Blood</em> launched with an online connection requirement in 2021, but a completely offline mode <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211220015958/https://back4blood.com/en-us/news/december-2021-update">was added just two months later</a>. And EA&#39;s <em>SimCity</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/simcity-belatedly-getting-a-dedicated-offline-mode/">finally got an offline mode</a> nearly a year after its disastrous online-only launch.</p>
<p><em>Redfall</em> is set for a May 2 release on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available through a Game Pass subscription.</p>
