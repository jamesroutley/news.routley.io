    <h1>Ask HN: Offline resources during internet outages?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have a feeling that the risk for different infrastructure problems has increased here in Europe. Assuming internet outage for somewhat extended time, what would be good resources/tools to keep locally just in case? Some that I can think quickly from the top of my head  might be:</p><p>- offline wikipedia</p><p>- offline stackoverflow</p><p>- youtube-dl</p><p>- libgen (are there tools to download e.g. only some genres?)</p></div></div></div>
