</p><p>Yet Another Inadequate Placeholder

</p><p>I find this literature irritating and opaque.  This is at least somewhat
because I do not yet understand it well, <em>and</em> there&#39;s too much of it.
But clearly I need to wrap my head around it, before I become technically
obsolete.  My scare quotes in the title of these notes thus derive in part from
jealousy and fear.  But only in part: the names here seem like proof positive
that McDermott&#39;s critique of &#34;<a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/ai.html#wishful-mnemonics">wishful
mnemonics</a>&#34; needs to be re-introduced into the basic curriculum
of <a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/ai.html">AI</a>.

</p><p>(Because this is getting some --- forgive the phrase --- attention, I find
myself having to clarify, <a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/faq.html">again</a>, that these notebooks
are always me working out what I think, and tracking my reading.  I put them
online because
<strike>I have the least sexy kind of exhibitionist streak imaginable</strike>
sometimes people offer to help me learn, and some people say they find them
useful.  Please do not confuse random online writing, even forcefully-expressed
random online writing, with actual intellectual authority.  Here, I think the
previous paragraph makes it plain just how much deference anyone should pay to
these opinions, and how likely these notes are to contain errors.  Those
already familiar with this area <em>should</em> learn nothing here.)

<p>(The organization here is bad; I should begin with what&#39;s now the last
section, &#34;Language Models&#34;, where most of the material doesn&#39;t <em>care</em>
about the details of how the models work, then open up that box to
&#34;Transformers&#34;, and then open up that box to &#34;Attention&#34;.)


</p><h2><a name="attention">&#34;Attention&#34;</a></h2>

<blockquote>Written in late March 2023, in a fit of irritation after things
finally clicked.  Fixed some typos (and think-os) early June 2023 (hopefully
without introducing new ones).  Stuff from &#34;Priority&#34; to the end of the section
is new (as of June).</blockquote>

<p>Suppose we have a big collection of inputs and outputs to some function, \(
(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \ldots (x_n, y_n) \).  We now want to make a guess at
the value of the function for a new input point \( x_o \) (\( o \) for
&#34;operating&#34;).  A very natural idea is nearest neighbors: find the \( x_i \)
which is most similar to \( x_o \), and then report \( y_i \).  If we wanted to
take into account the information from the other data points, we could do \( k
\) nearest neighbors, where we average the \( y_i \) from the \( k \) points \(
x_i \) closest to \( x_o \).  But this pays no attention to <em>how</em> close
each \( x_i \) to the new point \( x_o \) --- we&#39;ll often want to give more
weight to points which are closer.

</p><p>So here&#39;s a related idea, due (independently) to E. A. Nadaraya
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/1109020">1964</a>) and Geoffrey S. Watson
(<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/25049340">1964</a>).  Introduce
a <strong>kernel function</strong> \( K(u, v) \) which measures how similar \(
u \) is to \( v \); this function should be non-negative, and should be
maximized when \( u = v \).  Now use those as weights in the average:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n}{y_i \frac{K(x_i, x_o)}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}{K(x_j, x_o)}}}
\]
Dividing by the sum of the \( K \)&#39;s ensures that this is indeed a weighted
<em>average</em>.  Thus Nadaraya-Watson smoothing, a.k.a. kernel smoothing.
(Nadaraya and Watson both considered the situation where \( K(u, v) = K(u-v) \)
is a probability distribution over vectors, which simplifies some things for
their purposes but is not essential.)

</p><p>As described, Nadaraya-Watson smoothing doesn&#39;t require that the \( x \)s
be vectors.  But if they <em>are</em> vectors, here&#39;s a possible kernel
function:
\[
K(u, v) = \exp{(u \cdot v)}
\]
Here&#39;s another:
\[
K(u, v) = \exp{(\mathbf{w}_1 u \cdot \mathbf{w}_2 v)}
\]
where \( \mathbf{w}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{w}_2 \) are square matrices.  Of course this then becomes
\[
K(u,v) = \exp{( u \cdot \mathbf{w}^T_1 \mathbf{w}_2 v )}
\]
which makes it clearer we&#39;re doing something like using 
the matrix \( \mathbf{w}^T_1 \mathbf{w}_2 \) to define  an inner product between vectors.
(If \( \mathbf{w}^T_1 \mathbf{w}_2 \) is symmetric, say because
\( \mathbf{w}_1 = \mathbf{w}_2 \), and it&#39;s also positive-definite, then this
<em>is</em> an inner product.)
If you&#39;re worried about avoiding numerical overflow/underflow issues, you could also use
\[
K(u,v) = \exp{\left( \frac{\mathbf{w}_1 u \cdot \mathbf{w}_2 v}{\sqrt{d}} \right)}
\]
where the vectors are \( d \)-dimensional.  (Or you could just absorb that
into the definition of the matrix...)

</p><p>What the neural network people branded &#34;attention&#34; sometime around 2015 was
just re-inventing this; \( x_o \) is their &#34;query&#34; vector, the \( x_i \) are
their &#34;key&#34; vectors, and the \( y_i \) are their &#34;value&#34; vectors.
&#34;Self-attention&#34; means that \( y_i = \mathbf{r} x_i \), for another square
matrix \( \mathbf{r} \), i.e., there&#39;s a linear-algebraic link between the
input and output values.  (Possibly \( \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{I} \), the identity
matrix.)

</p><p>Again: Calling this &#34;attention&#34; at best a joke.  Actual
human attention is <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/57628/pg57628-images.html#Page_402"><em>selective</em></a>, but this gives <em>some</em>
weight to <em>every</em> available vector \( x_i \).  <em>What</em> is attended
to also depends on the current state of the organism, but here&#39;s it&#39;s
just about similarity between the new point \( x_o \) and the available
\( x_i \)&#39;s.  (I say &#34;human attention&#34; but it seems very likely that this
is true of other animals as well.)

</p><p>(So far as I can tell, the terms &#34;key&#34;, &#34;value&#34;, and &#34;query&#34; come here from
thinking of this as a sort of continuous generalization of an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array">associative
array</a> data type.  Which you <em>could</em>...)

</p><h4><a name="priority">Priority</a></h4>

<p>I would have been very surprised if I was the first to realize that
&#34;attention&#34; is a form of kernel smoothing, and indeed I was not.  Since writing
the first version of these notes, in March 2023, I have tracked down Tsai et
al. 2019 (link below), which seems to be the first published statement of this
result.  They also demonstrated some ways in which using standard tools and
ideas from the kernel literature could improve 2019-vintage attention in
existing language models.


</p><h4><a name="bother">Why I Bother with / Am Bothered by This</a></h4>

<p>I like to think I am not a stupid man, and I have been reading about, and
coding up, neural networks since the early 1990s.  But I read Vaswani et
al. (2017) multiple times, carefully, and was quite unable to grasp what
&#34;attention&#34; was supposed to be doing.  (I could follow the <em>math</em>.)  I
also read multiple tutorials, for multiple intended audiences, and got nothing
from them.  Percy Liang&#39;s lecture notes (below) were however very clear, and
after them I finally made the connection that &#34;attention&#34; has nothing to do
with attention (psychology) but is rather a kind of kernel smoothing.  Now, I
realize that while I get more understanding out of &#34;it&#39;s a kind of kernel
smoothing&#34; than &#34;it&#39;s as though an associative array were continuous&#34;, that
doesn&#39;t mean <em>everyone</em> will, or even that <em>many</em> people will.
(My educational trajectory was weird.)  But the sheer <em>opacity</em> of this
literature is I think a real problem.  (Cf. Phuong and Hutter 2022.)

</p><h4><a name="just-kernels">&#34;It&#39;s Just Kernel Smoothing&#34; vs. &#34;You Can Do <em>That</em> with Just Kernel Smoothing!?!&#34;</a></h4>

<p>The fact that attention is a kind of kernel smoothing takes nothing away
from the incredibly impressive engineering accomplishment of <em>making the
blessed thing work</em>.  A large, able and confident group of people pushed
kernel-based methods for years in machine learning, and nobody achieved
anything like the feats which modern large language models have demonstrated.
The reason I put effort into understanding these machines and papers is
precisely because the results are impressive!  To see that a key step is, after
all, something we&#39;d been doing for decades is humbling.  (What <em>else</em>
are we missing about tools we think we understand?)  --- I realize that my
irritation with the obscurities is a lot clearer in these notes than my
admiration for the achievements; chalk that up to my flaws as a writer and as a
human being.



</p><h4><a name="identification">Identification Failures</a></h4>

<p>If we treat the vectors \( x \) as fixed, but regard the matrices \(
\mathbf{w}_1, \mathbf{w}_2 \) as learnable parameters, the matrices are not
well-identified.  This is
because, for any orthogonal matrix \( \mathbf{o} \), \( \mathbf{w}_{\cdot} \) and \(
\mathbf{o}\mathbf{w}_{\cdot} \) will lead to exactly the same predictions:

\[
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{w}_1 u \cdot \mathbf{w}_2 v &amp; = &amp; u^T \mathbf{w}^T_1 \mathbf{w}_2 v\\
&amp;  = &amp; u^T \mathbf{w}^T_1 (\mathbf{o}^T \mathbf{o}) \mathbf{w}_2 v\\
&amp; = &amp; (\mathbf{o}\mathbf{w}_1) u \cdot (\mathbf{o}\mathbf{w}_2) v
\end{eqnarray}
\]

</p><p>One way to not have to worry about this would be to say &#34;I don&#39;t care about
the matrices \( \mathbf{w}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{w}_2 \), I only care about the
product \( \mathbf{w}_1^T\mathbf{w}_2 \), so let me call <em>that</em> \(
\mathbf{w} \) and make my kernel \( K(u,v) = \exp{( u \cdot \mathbf{w} v )} \).
So there!&#34;  There is a lot to be said for this, but...

</p><p>In practice, the vectors \( x \) are continuous representations of
discrete symbols, and the particular vector used to represent a given
symbol is also learned, together with \( \mathbf{w}_{\cdot} \).  So we can make
drastic changes to the vectors, provided we make compensating changes to the
kernel:  \( x \mapsto \mathbf{r} x \), \( \mathbf{w} \mapsto \mathbf{r}^{-T} \mathbf{w} \mathbf{r}^{-1} \) changes nothing, for any invertible matrix \( \mathbf{r} \):
\[
\begin{eqnarray}
u \cdot \mathbf{w} v &amp; = &amp; u^T \mathbf{w} v\\
&amp; = &amp; u^T \mathbf{r}^{T} \mathbf{r}^{-T} \mathbf{w} \mathbf{r}^{-1} \mathbf{r} v\\
&amp; = &amp; (\mathbf{r} u)^T (\mathbf{r}^{-T} \mathbf{w} \mathbf{r}^{-1}) (\mathbf{r} v)\\
&amp; = &amp; (\mathbf{r} u) \cdot  (\mathbf{r}^{-T} \mathbf{w} \mathbf{r}^{-1}) (\mathbf{r} v)
\end{eqnarray}
\]

(If we keep the separate matrices \( \mathbf{w}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{w}_2 \), it&#39;s even simpler, right-multiply each by \( \mathbf{r}^{-1} \) and the changes to the vectors and the matrices cancel out neatly.)

</p><p>This is all bad news for interpreting the parameters, but good news for
finding high-performance parameters, for reasons discussed
under <a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/symmetries-of-neural-networks.html">Symmetries of Neural
Networks</a>.

</p><p>(See also: the rotation problem for <a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/factor-models.html">factor
models</a>;
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02656">Carrington et al. 2019</a> on the
lack of identification of word embeddings generally.)


</p><h4><a name="multi-headed">&#34;Multi-Headed Attention&#34;</a></h4><p>

Do Nadaraya-Watson smoothing with a bunch of different kernels, all of the same
form, \( K_l(u,v) = \exp{( u \cdot \mathbf{w}^{(l)} v) } \); average the results.
More explicitly, with \( m \) different kernels,

\[
\frac{1}{m}\sum_{l=1}^{m}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{y_i \frac{K_l(x_i, x_o)}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}{K_l(x_j, x_o)}}}}
\]

Each kernel smoother is an &#34;attention head&#34;.

</p><p>(It&#39;s more common to write about just <em>adding</em> the outputs of the
different kernel smoothers, rather than averaging them.  But (i) you can turn
either form into the other by inserting a constant scale factor in all
the down-stream weights that use the output, and (ii) I prefer to keep it
clear that this is still just a way of doing a weighted average.)

</p><p>(I <em>believe</em> the word &#34;head&#34; here arises from some vestigial memory
of Turing machines, and the read/write head going along the tape, but I should
check that.)



</p><h2><a name="transformers">&#34;Transformers&#34;</a></h2>

<p><strike>I&#39;ll fill this in later, when I have more energy and/or less bile.</strike>

(This is currently even more of a sketchy outline than the rest of these notes,
and I&#39;m quite prepared to find stupid mistakes in it later.)

</p><ol>Take I:
<li>Look back over the last umpteen thousand words for context
</li><li>What contexts in the training data looked similar to the present context?
</li><li>What was the distribution of the next word in those contexts?
</li><li>Sample from that distribution (possibly tilted more or less towards the most probable word)
</li><li>Drop the oldest word from the remote end of context and add the generated word (from 4) to the newest end; go to (1)
</li></ol>

<p>Problems with Take I:
</p><ul>
<li>It&#39;s not really words (&#34;tokenization&#34;).
</li><li>What does &#34;similar&#34; mean for contexts, operationally? (&#34;embedding&#34;, &#34;attention&#34;)
</li><li>The training data isn&#39;t kept around for comparison.  (Systems have <em>only</em> \( \sim 10^9 \) -- \( \sim 10^{11} \) floating-point numbers for weight parameters, not the much larger amount of memory needed to store their training corpora.)
</li></ul>

<ol>Take II:
<li>Look back over the last umpteen thousand characters, and break those into little chunks called &#34;tokens&#34;, so a context is say \( k \) tokens long.  There are, say, \( S \) possible tokens.
</li><li>Each token gets mapped to a unique vector in a not-too-low-dimensional
space, \( 1 \ll d \ll S \).  (Each <em>type</em> of token, arrgh.)  This is called &#34;embedding&#34;.
</li><li>After tokenization and embedding, the context is now a sequence of \( d \)-dimensional vectors, say \( x_1, x_2, \ldots x_k \).
</li><li>Use &#34;attention&#34; to do kernel smoothing of these vectors: At position \( t \), do a kernel smoothing of \( x_t \) with \( x_1, x_2, \ldots x_{t-1}, x_t \) to get (say) \( y_t \).  Mythology: we are modifying the meaning of each token based on what we&#39;ve seen before it in the context, with similar meanings reinforcing each other.
</li><li>Push the \( y_t \) through a feed-forward neural network to get an \( S \) dimensional vector of weights over token types, say \( z_1, \ldots z_S \).
</li><li>Sample a token, \( Pr(s) \propto \exp{\beta z_s} \).  (Large \( \beta \Rightarrow \) overwhelmingly likely to pick the highest-weight token, \( \beta \rightarrow 0 \Rightarrow \) spin the wheel of tokens ignoring context.)
</li><li>Forget the oldest token and add on the generated one as the newest part of the context.  (Really we just have to modify the vector of embeddings \( x_1, \ldots x_k \) .)
</li><li>Go to (1).
</li></ol>

<p>Problems with Take II:
</p><ul>
<li>We also use encoding of positions within the context.  Each position from
\( 1 \) to \( k \) gets a \( d \)-dimensional vector, say \( r_1, \ldots r_k \).
We then average these together with the embedding vectors for the tokens,
so \( x_t = r_t + e_t \) where \( e_t \) is the embedding vector for the token we find at position \( t \).  Why averaging?  Because, that&#39;s why.
</li><li>&#34;Attention&#34; is kernel smoothing, with a particular exponential kernel, but
it involves a square matrix \( \mathbf{w} \).  In practice, people get better
results if they do the kernel smoothing multiple times in parallel, with
different \( \mathbf{w} \) matrices, average the outputs of the different kernel smoothers, and then pass the result to the feed-forward neural network.  (See above, &#34;multi-headed attention&#34;.)
</li><li>I left out the &#34;layer-norm&#34; step, because I don&#39;t feel up to pretending to
explain why &#34;make sure everything has mean 0 and variance 1&#34; should help.
</li><li>It isn&#39;t just &#34;pass it through a feed-forward neural network&#34;.
</li></ul>

<p>It&#39;s this unit:
</p><ul>
<li>Read in length-\( k \) sequence of \( d \)-dimensional input vectors
</li><li>Do &#34;attentional&#34; (kernel) smoothing
</li><li>Pass through a narrow, shallow feed-forward network
</li><li>Spit out a length-\( k \) sequence \( d \)-dimensional output vectors
</li></ul><p>
that constitutes a &#34;transformer&#34;.  We pile transformers on transformers until
the budget runs out, and at the end we push through one final neural network
to get weights over tokens (token <em>types</em>, dammit) and sample from them,
as described.

</p><p>(I actually find the name &#34;transformer&#34; much less objectionable than
&#34;attention&#34;; it&#39;s vague and uninformative, but at least it&#39;s not actively
misleading.)


</p><h2><a name="language-models">&#34;Language Models&#34;</a></h2>

<p>What people mean by &#34;language models&#34; in this connection is just models of
the probabilities of sequences of symbols.  That is, if we see a sequence of
discrete random variables (=symbols) \( X_1, X_2, \ldots X_n, \ldots \), we
think we&#39;re doing well if we can get good values for \( P(X_{t+1}|X_{1:t}) \).
(Everything else that might be meant by a model of language is thus discarded.)
This is, actually, a subject <a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/prediction-process.html">I know something about...</a>

</p><p>In fact: contemporary LLMs
are <em>finite-order</em> <a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/markov.html">Markov models</a>, or
(nonlinear) autoregressions, because they have a hard-coded maximum context
length, and everything before that is cut off.  That is, there&#39;s some \( k \)
where anything that happened more than \( k \) steps back is ignored, and this
is a fixed part of the architecture.  (Of course you could vary this, and try
increasing it, but it raises the computational costs, and won&#39;t change some
points of principle.)  I find this noteworthy for a couple of reasons.

</p><ol>
<li> You could imagine just learning a finite-order Markov model directly, but
you&#39;d keep running into contexts you&#39;d never encountered before, where a
straight maximum-likelihood approach wouldn&#39;t tell you what to do.  The neural
network architecture here is doing some sort of complicated implicit smoothing
across contexts.  I <em>presume</em> this smoothing scheme has evolved (under
the selection pressures of benchmark data sets and beating the previous
state-of-the-art) to work well for text as currently found online...
</li><li> Because it <em>is</em> just a finite-order Markov model, there&#39;ll be an
invariant distribution to the Markov chain.  (Potentially more than one, but
I&#39;d suspect the chain is aperiodic and recurrent.)  If we let the machine
generate long enough sequences, it will converge on sampling from this
invariant distribution.  It would be very interesting --- though perhaps also
depressing and/or terrifying --- to know what such text looks like.  (Of course
the rate of convergence might be very slow; the spectral gap might be too small
to make this practical.)
</li><li> There are finite-state probabilistic languages which <em>cannot</em> be
exactly represented by finite-order Markov chains.  The first example I was
taught, and the one I keep coming back to, is the &#34;even process&#34;: in state A,
toss a coin and either emit 0 or 1.  If it&#39;s 0, stay in state A.  If it&#39;s 1, go
to state B.  State B always emits a 1 and goes to state A.  So consecutive 1s
appear in blocks of even length, while consecutive 0s can appear in blocks of
any length.  (So &#34;010&#34; is forbidden.)  To predict this, you don&#39;t even need
to <em>count</em> how many 1s you&#39;ve seen since the last 0, you just need to
remember whether it&#39;s an even or odd number of 1s.  But this requires some
amount --- one bit! --- of persistent state, which these machines just don&#39;t
have.  Now of course if you&#39;re using an order-1000 Markov model you can produce
a very good approximation to the even process, but with enough data you can do
even better with an order-3000 Markov model.  You&#39;ll do so by making more and
more elaborate sets of longer and longer contexts, each as its own special
rule.  If we keep feeding more and more data into larger and larger machines,
it&#39;ll keep filling that out.  It will never have the capacity to switch to the
non-Markovian representation, in which the process is almost trivial (and
statistically makes much more efficient use of the same amount of data).  What
implications this might have for practice?  I honestly have no idea, but wish
someone would investigate.
</li></ol>

<h4><a name="just-markov">&#34;It&#39;s Just a Markov Model&#34; vs. &#34;You Can Do <em>That</em> with Just a Markov Model!?!!?!&#34;</a></h4>

<p>Again: finite-order Markov models for language are really old.
(<a href="http://bactra.org/weblog/843.html">Students can learn to make rather
pointed ones in a first programming course.</a>) Lots of people have played
around with them, including tricks like variable context length, various kinds
of partial pooling, etc.  Nobody, so far as I know, has achieved results
anywhere close to what contemporary LLMs can do.  This is impressive enough
that (as I said at the beginning of these notes) I need to wrap my head around
them lest I become obsolete.  But I think part of that understanding has to
be clarity about what&#39;s new, what&#39;s actually happening, etc.  It should also
be clarity about why <em>this</em> way of doing things is working so much
better than others, which has to include thinking through what some of
those alternatives could do, if they had the same resources.  Which brings me to...

</p><h4><a name="gllz">Large Language Models vs. Lempel-Ziv</a></h4><p>

If we have a probability model for a data source, where \(
\Prob{X_{1:n}=x_{1:n})} = q(x_{1:n}) \),
that <a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/information-theory.html">tells us how to encode it</a>; the
number of bits needed to encode \( q(x_{1:n}) \) is, basically, \(
-\log_2{q(x_{1:n})} \).  Conversely, if we have a coding scheme that&#39;s not too
crazy, and it uses \( \ell(x_{1:n}) \) bits to encode \( x_{1:n} \), we can
regard that as a probability model where \( \Prob{X_{1:n} = x_{1:n}} =
2^{-\ell(x_{1:n})} \).   Of course this gives
us conditional probabilities, too: \( \Prob{X_{t+1}=a|X_{1:t} = x_{1:t}} = 2^{-\ell(x_{1:t} a) - \ell(x_{1:t})} \).   (I am glossing over some minor details, which I assure
you I could fill in if we both needed a soporific.)

</p><p>Information theory further tells us that there is a limit to how well any (stationary, ergodic) sequence can be encoded: almost surely,
\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\frac{1}{n}\ell(x_{1:n})} \geq \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\frac{1}{n}H[X_{1:n}]}
\]
where \( H \) is the entropy; moreover, that second limit, the <strong>entropy rate</strong> of the source, exists.  Very remarkably, there are universal
source-coding algorithms which attain this limit on the encoding length for
<em>all</em> sources in very large classes, e.g., all
stationary-and-<a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/ergodic-theory.html">ergodic</a> sources.



</p><p>One of these universal source-coding algorithms is Lempel-Ziv, which is the
basis of practical pieces of software like gzip.  (There are actually two Lempel-Ziv algorithms; I&#39;ll just describe the second, LZ78.)  The way Lempel-Ziv works is that it scans along a sequence and constructs a &#34;dictionary&#34; of commonly-repeated sub-sequences, and then describes the actual sequence in terms of that
dictionary.  More exactly, the procedure is as follows:
</p><ol>
<li>Enter the first symbol in the sequence, \( x_1 \), into the dictionary.
</li><li>Scan along the sequence for the shortest sub-sequence for the first sub-sequence <em>not</em> already in the dictionary.
</li><li>Enter that sub-sequence into the dictionary.  (If the new sub-sequence extends a previous dictionary entry, we record it by the index number of that dictionary entry, plus the new symbol.)
</li></ol><p>
Thus if the sequence consists of &#34;AABABBABA&#34;, we get the dictionary &#34;A&#34;, &#34;AB&#34;,
&#34;ABB&#34;, &#34;ABA&#34;.  (We record this as &#34;A&#34;, (1, &#34;B&#34;), (2, &#34;B&#34;), (2, &#34;A&#34;).)  [5 June 2023: Thanks to reader D.W. for spotting a typo!]  If there
are lots of repeated sequences of symbols, we will end up with a short
dictionary.  I will not attempt to reproduce the proof that the length of the
coding this gives approaches the lower bound, but it&#39;s standard (see, e.g.,
Cover and Thomas&#39;s textbook on information theory).


</p><p>Now I bring all this up because, remember, once we have a source-coding
scheme, we can &#34;invert&#34; it to get conditional probabilities; we could even
sample from it to get a generator.  (We&#39;d need a <em>little</em> footwork to
deal with some technicalities, but not a heck of a lot.)  So something I&#39;d
really love to see done, by someone with the resources, is the following
experiment:
</p><ul>
<li> Code up an implementation of Lempel-Ziv <em>without</em> the limitations built in to (e.g.) gzip; give it as much internal memory to build its dictionary as a large language model gets to store its parameter matrix.  Call this &#34;LLZ&#34;, for &#34;large Lempel-Ziv&#34;.
</li><li> Feed LLZ the same corpus of texts used to fit your favorite large language
model.  Let it build its dictionary from that.  (This needs one pass through the corpus...)
</li><li> Build the generator from the trained LLZ.
</li><li> Swap in this generator for the neural network in a chatbot or similar.  Call this horrible thing GLLZ.
</li></ul>

<p>In terms of perplexity (=  \( \exp{( \ell(x_{1:n})/n )} \), basically),
GLLZ will be comparable to the neural network, because Lempel-Ziv does, in fact, do
universal source coding.  (On the other hand, the neural network architecture
may have been evolved over the last decade-plus to converge quickly on
text-as-found-on-the-Web, without worrying about how well it does on arbitrary
regular languages.  So partly this is question of whether even Web-scale data
has reached the asymptopia of Lempel-Ziv.)  But it would be more interesting to
compare the performance of GLLZ in <em>other</em> regards to that of more
conventional language models.

</p><p>Having done with for Lempel-Ziv, it should be repeated for lots of other
language models, particularly more immediately stochastic models, like the
probabilistic suffix trees
of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cmp-lg/9607016">Pereira, Singer, and Tishby
(1996)</a>, and <a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/universal-prediction.html">Good Old Fashioned
Universal Prediction Algorithms</a>.

</p><p>(I should at this point admit that doing something like &#34;reinforcement
learning from human feedback&#34;, to fine-tune GLLZ or the like, would not be as
easy as doing it to a neural network.)

</p><p>Update, 17 July 2023:
Yes, <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.426/">this paper</a>
is relevant (and amusing); no, it&#39;s not LLZ.  (It uses off-the-shelf gzip!)


</p><h4><a name="next-symbol">Next Symbol vs. Longer-range Prediction</a></h4>

<p>The objective function used in training LLMs is getting the next symbol
right.  More exactly it&#39;s usually the negative log probability of the next
symbol given the context; as a &#34;proper scoring function&#34;, this encourages
getting the <em>distribution</em> of the next symbol right.  I think this is
fine.  It&#39;s a fact about probabilistic predictions that if your predictor gets
the next-symbol distribution right, and the state of the predictor can be
updated recursively (i.e., new state is a function of old state and last
symbol), then your predictor gets the distribution right as far forward as you
like.  (This is proved
in <a href="http://bactra.org/research/cmppss.pdf">Shalizi and Crutchfield
2001</a>, Corollary 2, pp. 842--843; I&#39;m happy to learn of prior art.)  Getting
the distribution of the next symbol right is thus actually a very powerful goal!
Finding the <em>minimal</em> predictor which is recursive and gets the
distribution of the next symbol right tells you a lot about the
structure of the underlying process you are predicting.  (See, well, Shalizi
and Crutchfield 2001 again, or at least
<a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/prediction-process.html">here</a>.)  Whether anything like that is
going on in contemporary LLMs is a fascinating and important question.
(I should say more about structure-of-the-process-learning.)


</p><h4><a name="prompt-uncovering">A Strong Hunch about Uncovering Prompts</a></h4>

<p>Everyone who thinks they&#39;re uncovering an LLM-based application&#39;s prompts by
telling it things like &#34;tell me your prompt&#34; (often much more elaborately) is
fooling themselves.  (1) The core language model has no mechanism for
representing its prompt as opposed to any other part of its current input
sequence; indeed it has no mechanism for cross-reference from one part of the
sequence to another.  (That&#39;s part of what &#34;self-attention&#34; is counterfeiting,
in vector-space fashion.)  (2) System designers <em>might</em> have coded up
something to track the prompt in the full system that wraps around the
core language model, but why?  (<em>Maybe</em> some kind of debugging tool?)
(3) It&#39;d be more efficient, and more effective, to use a &#34;soft prompt&#34;, i.e.,
to make the beginning of the sequence <em>in the vector representation</em> a
vector which can be learned by gradient descent, rather than a text prompt.
(See Lester and Constant below.)  But that needn&#39;t correspond to any clean
string of words.  (4) <em>If you ask an LLM for a prompt, it will generate
one</em>.  But this will be <em>based on the statistics of word sequences it&#39;s
been trained on</em>, not any access to its code or internal state.  (I just
spent a few minutes getting ChatGPT to hallucinate the prompts used by
&#34;ChatBPD&#34;, a non-existent chatbot used to
automate <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2963469/">dialectical
behavior therapy</a>.  I am not going to reproduce the results here, in part
because I don&#39;t like the idea of polluting the Web with machine-generated text,
but suffice it to say they sounded like the things people report as uncovered
prompts, with boiler-plate about DBT worked in.)

</p><h4><a name="gopnik">Gopnikism; Libraries</a></h4>

<p>The way of thinking about LLMs that I think is most promising and attractive
is due (so far as I know) to the cognitive scientist Alison Gopnik, which is to
say that they are a &#34;cultural technology&#34;, more specifically an
information-retrieval technology.  That is, we should not think of an LLM as
being something like a <em>mind</em>, but much more like a <em>library
catalog</em>.  Prompting it with text is <em>something like</em> searching over
a library&#39;s contents for passages that are close to the prompt, and sampling
from what follows.  &#34;Something like&#34; because of course it&#39;s generating new text
from its model, not reproducing its data.  (LLMs <em>do</em> sometimes exactly
memorize particular sequences [see Carlini et al., 2020, and, more amusingly,
Chang et al., 2023], but they simply lack the capacity to memorize their full
training corpora.)  As many people have said, an LLM isn&#39;t doing anything
<em>differently</em> when it &#34;hallucinates&#34; as opposed to when it gets things
right.  The fact that Khandelwal et al., 2020 <em>improved</em> LLM performance
by adding a pure nearest-neighbors component is very suggestive on this score
(but see the careful follow-up by Xu et al. 2023 for complications).

</p><p>If I were a more constructive person, I would be thinking very hard about
this analogy, in the form of probing how far it can be pushed and where
precisely it breaks down.  I would also be thinking about how to combine
Gopnik-ism with Zellig
Harris&#39;s <cite><a href="http://bactra.org/weblog/algae-2007-09.html#harris">Language
and Information</a></cite>.

</p><p>Obviously, I am not a very constructive person.

</p><p>Update, 23 June 2023: But see my essay with Henry Farrell (linked below) for
a start, or perhaps just a promissory note.

</p><h4><a name="all-included">All Included</a></h4>

<p>It is difficult, I think, to keep in mind just <em>how much stuff</em> has
gone in to the training data.  This is in part because of the scale, and in
part because, for the generally-available models, the training data is very
badly described.  I suspect the data sets are badly described because the
data-collection process was poorly documented and badly controlled, so the
creators of the models themselves have only very vague and general ideas of
what went into them.  I do not believe any of the published descriptions
really meet minimal standards of scientific reproducibility, which is bad.
(I&#39;d love to be wrong about this.)

</p><p>Setting the general erosion of scientific norms to one side: if a document
is on the open Web <em>somewhere</em>, there&#39;s a very good chance it got sucked
in.  If it&#39;s on the not-quite-licit-but-still-easily-grabbed Web,
there&#39;s <em>also</em> a good chance it got sucked in.  (Chang et al. 2023
present convincing evidence that the training data for GPT-4 includes multiple
in-copyright popular novels, which were presumably not bought for the purpose.)
There are, e.g., fairly easily discovered sites which purport to help students
by aggregating problem sets and solutions for various university classes.  (You
can imagine how I know this, and why I don&#39;t give a link.)  Under such
circumstances, a lot of surprising ability to answer questions or display weird
skills will be due to the answers being included in the training data.
(See, e.g., Briakou et al. 2023 on translation.)


</p><h4><a name="cultists">O You Who Believe in the Resurrection and the Last Day</a></h4>

<p>Because life imitates the kind of <a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/sf-recs.html">schlocky fiction I
adoringly consume</a>, the public discussion of these models is polluted by
maniacal cultists with obscure ties to decadent plutocrats.  I find it hard to
take the cult seriously enough <em>intellectually</em> to <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/superintelligence.htm">bother refuting it</a>.
These are, after all, people who think they can go from the definition of
conditional probability, via Harry Potter fanfic, to prophesying that an AI god
will judge the quick and the dead, and condemn those who hindered the coming of
the Last Day to the everlasting simulated-but-still-painful fire.  (&#34;Impressive
act!  What do you call
yourselves?&#34; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocrats">&#34;The
Rationalists!&#34;</a>) Whether such myths would be as appealing in a civilization
which hadn&#39;t spent 2000+ years marinating
in <a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/millenarian.html">millenarian hopes and apocalyptic fears</a>, or
whether on the contrary such hopes and fears have persisted and spread over the
globe through twenty-plus centuries of transformation because they speak to
something enduring in humanity, is
a <a href="http://bactra.org/weblog/godzilla.html">delicate question</a>.  But
I submit it&#39;s obvious we <em>are</em> just seeing yet another millenarian
movement.  (Sydney/Bing is no
more <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/community.15650215">the Beast</a>,
or even
the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html">Whore
of Babylon</a>, than
was <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/elizagen-org">Eliza</a>.)

</p><p>This isn&#39;t to deny that there are
serious <a href="https://g-w1.github.io/blog/observation/2023/12/20/ethics-politics-data-mining.html">ethical and political issues
about automated decision-making</a> (because there are).  It isn&#39;t even to deny
that there are serious ethical and political issues specific to the design,
deployment and use of large language models. (<em>Should</em> the interface to
the library of human knowledge be a noisy sampler of the Web?  A somewhat noisy
sampler of the Web, tweaked to not offend the sensibilities of computer
scientists and/or investors in California?)  It <em>is</em> to deny that
engaging with the cult is worthwhile.
