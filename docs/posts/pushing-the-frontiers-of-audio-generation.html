This technology powers single-speaker audio in many Google products and experiments — including <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/made-by-google-gemini-ai-updates/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gemini Live</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/project-astra/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Project Astra</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Journey Voices</a> and <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/made-on-youtube-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube’s auto dubbing</a> — and is helping people around the world interact with more natural, conversational and intuitive digital assistants and AI tools.</p><p data-block-key="7838d">Working together with partners across Google, we recently helped develop two new features that can generate long-form, multi-speaker dialogue for making complex content more accessible:</p><ul><li data-block-key="5j7f7"><a href="https://notebooklm.google/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NotebookLM Audio Overviews</a> turns uploaded documents into engaging and lively dialogue.

  <h2 data-block-key="auxvk">Pioneering techniques for audio generation</h2><p data-block-key="2rhdn">For years, we&#39;ve been investing in audio generation research and exploring new ways for generating more natural dialogue in our products and experimental tools. In our previous research on <a href="https://research.google/blog/soundstorm-efficient-parallel-audio-generation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SoundStorm</a>, we first demonstrated the ability to generate 30-second segments of natural dialogue between multiple speakers.</p><p data-block-key="ecfnq">This extended our earlier work, <a href="https://research.google/blog/soundstream-an-end-to-end-neural-audio-codec/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SoundStream</a> and <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/audiolm/examples/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AudioLM</a>, which allowed us to apply many text-based language modeling techniques to the problem of audio generation.</p><p data-block-key="7m7rr">SoundStream is a neural audio codec that efficiently compresses and decompresses an audio input, without compromising its quality. As part of the training process, SoundStream learns how to map audio to a range of acoustic tokens. These tokens capture all of the information needed to reconstruct the audio with high fidelity, including properties such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">prosody</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre" rel="noopener" target="_blank">timbre</a>.</p><p data-block-key="3bngd">AudioLM treats audio generation as a language modeling task to produce the acoustic tokens of codecs like SoundStream. As a result, the AudioLM framework makes no assumptions about the type or makeup of the audio being generated, and can flexibly handle a variety of sounds without needing architectural adjustments — making it a good candidate for modeling multi-speaker dialogues.</p>

              <p data-block-key="6qplr">Building upon this research, our latest speech generation technology can produce 2 minutes of dialogue, with improved naturalness, speaker consistency and acoustic quality, when given a script of dialogue and speaker turn markers. The model also performs this task in under 3 seconds on a single <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/v5e" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) v5e chip</a>, in one inference pass. This means it generates audio over 40-times faster than real time.</p>

  <h2 data-block-key="uq3en">Scaling our audio generation models</h2><p data-block-key="du2ro">Scaling our single-speaker generation models to multi-speaker models then became a matter of data and model capacity. To help our latest speech generation model produce longer speech segments, we created an even more efficient speech codec for compressing audio into a sequence of tokens, in as low as 600 bits per second, without compromising the quality of its output.</p><p data-block-key="g9ht">The tokens produced by our codec have a hierarchical structure and are grouped by time frames. The first tokens within a group capture phonetic and prosodic information, while the last tokens encode fine acoustic details.</p><p data-block-key="7vshj">Even with our new speech codec, producing a 2-minute dialogue requires generating over 5000 tokens. To model these long sequences, we developed a specialized <a href="https://research.google/blog/transformer-a-novel-neural-network-architecture-for-language-understanding/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Transformer</a> architecture that can efficiently handle hierarchies of information, matching the structure of our acoustic tokens.</p><p data-block-key="8djch">With this technique, we can efficiently generate acoustic tokens that correspond to the dialogue, within a single autoregressive inference pass. Once generated, these tokens can be decoded back into an audio waveform using our speech codec.</p>

  <p data-block-key="269cj">To teach our model how to generate realistic exchanges between multiple speakers, we pretrained it on hundreds of thousands of hours of speech data. Then we finetuned it on a much smaller dataset of dialogue with high acoustic quality and precise speaker annotations, consisting of unscripted conversations from a number of voice actors and realistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_disfluency" rel="noopener" target="_blank">disfluencies</a> — the “umm”s and “aah”s of real conversation. This step taught the model how to reliably switch between speakers during a generated dialogue and to output only studio quality audio with realistic pauses, tone and timing.</p><p data-block-key="8shit">In line with our <a href="https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AI Principles</a> and our commitment to developing and deploying AI technologies responsibly, we’re incorporating our SynthID technology to watermark non-transient AI-generated audio content from these models, to help safeguard against the potential misuse of this technology.</p>

From enhancing learning experiences to making content more universally accessible, we’re excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with voice-based technologies.</p>
