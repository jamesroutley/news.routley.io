    <h1>Petnames: A humane approach to secure, decentralized naming</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-2-1">
<p>
One system that is already very similar to a petnames system is a
smartphone&#39;s contact list application.
Contact list applications use phone numbers as a global namespace
without making phone numbers the primary user experience.
Human meaningful names are mapped to phone numbers with no pretense
that the names have global experience; the names are chosen by each
human operator according to what is useful to them.<sup><a id="fnr.not-just-phone-numbers" href="#fn.not-just-phone-numbers" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
The UI uses this mapping both to search and select entities from a
contact list to display a name in an incoming call, or to review call
history.
The rendering it done in terms of a live mapping; should an entity&#39;s
petname be updated, that petname will be retroactively updated on the
call history.
</p>

<p>
So a smartphone contact list brings us reasonably far, but not quite
far enough.
Let&#39;s consider a scenario in which we can explore the rest of the
pieces to complete this puzzle.
</p>

<p>
Alyssa receives a phone call from 1-324-555-8953.
However, when she checks her phone to answer it, she does not see
the phone number itself, she sees &#34;Mom&#34;, which is the petname she has
bound locally to the phone number.
</p>


<p><img src="https://files.spritely.institute/papers/imgs/petnames-pictures/incoming-call-mom.svg" alt="incoming-call-mom.svg"/>
</p>

<p>
Alyssa answers the call and her mother, Dr. Nym, mentions that she&#39;s
giving a special lecture on mathematics that she would like help
organizing, and wonders if any of Alyssa&#39;s friends may be interested
in attending or assisting.
Alyssa offers to help and suggests that her long-time friend Ben
Bitdiddle may be interested in both attending and helping.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Nym says goodbye to her daughter and hangs up the phone.
She searches for &#34;Ben&#34; in her contact list:
</p>


<p><img src="https://files.spritely.institute/papers/imgs/petnames-pictures/search-interface.png" alt="search-interface.png"/>
</p>

<p>
The &#34;personal contacts&#34; section shows <b><b>petnames</b></b> of people she knows,
and &#34;Ben Grossmeier&#34; is a research colleague of Dr. Nym&#39;s.
The &#34;network contacts&#34; shows <b><b>edge names</b></b> published by entities
Dr. Nym has stored locally as<sup><a id="fnr.sorting-in-petname-systems" href="#fn.sorting-in-petname-systems" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup></sup>
petnames.
Dr. Nym has stored her daughter as &#34;Alyssa&#34;, and so when she sees
&#34;Alyssa ⇒ Ben Bitdiddle&#34; (&#34;Ben Bitdiddle&#34; being the edge name supplied
by Alyssa) she is confident this must be her daughter&#39;s friend.
She clicks this entry and dials Ben.
</p>

<p>
Ben hears an incoming call and sees that the caller is labeled
&#34;Alyssa ⇒ Jane Nym&#34; and in smaller text &#34;Faculty ⇒ Dr. Nym&#34;.
</p>


<p><img src="https://files.spritely.institute/papers/imgs/petnames-pictures/incoming-call-edge-names.png" alt="incoming-call-edge-names.png"/>
</p>

<p>
While Ben did not have Dr. Nym saved with a local petname, he
has both Alyssa and the university&#39;s Faculty directory saved as local
petnames, and from the both of those remembers that Alyssa&#39;s mother
is named Jane Nym and that she is a professor on campus.
Ben accepts the call and enthusiastically agrees to help Dr. Nym
set up the event.
Ben offers to coordinate food for the event, and Dr. Nym
enthusiastically states that while she will place an order for pizza,
she would not have time to pick it up beforehand, and so help there
would be greatly appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Ben decides that since he is helping out that he should store
Dr. Nym&#39;s contact information permanently in his address book.
Ben checks the call history and sees that the first item says
a call from &#34;Alyssa ⇒ Jane Nym&#34;.
He selects &#34;Save Contact&#34; from a menu.
</p>

<p>
On the edit screen that appears, a &#34;local name&#34; widget is immediately
selected with a suggested entry of &#34;Jane Nym&#34; highlighted in such
a way that if Ben were to begin typing he could override this text.
</p>


<p><img src="https://files.spritely.institute/papers/imgs/petnames-pictures/edit-contact.png" alt="edit-contact.png"/>
</p>

<p>
Ben decides this name is good enough; since he knows Alyssa&#39;s mother
on a personal basis through Alyssa, he is comfortable thinking about
her as Jane Nym.
Ben decides that he would also like to share this contact as an edge
name with the rest of his contacts, and so presses the &#34;share with
contacts&#34; button.
Once again Ben is presented with an editable field with the name
&#34;Jane Nym&#34; preselected, but Ben decides to edit this edge name to
be called &#34;Dr. Nym&#34;.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://files.spritely.institute/papers/imgs/petnames-pictures/edit-contact-with-edgename.png" alt="edit-contact-with-edgename.png"/>
<img src="https://files.spritely.institute/papers/imgs/petnames-pictures/edit-contact-with-edgename-dr-nym.png" alt="edit-contact-with-edgename-dr-nym.png"/>
</p>

<p>
While Ben knows Dr. Nym on a first name basis in a personal context,
Ben and Dr. Nym both work in an academic setting, and in such contexts
he thinks it would be respectful for others to hear Dr. Nym referred
to with her full title.
Dr. Nym&#39;s phone number is already entered, and with the mapping
established, Ben presses save.<sup><a id="fnr.composite-values" href="#fn.composite-values" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>
Returning to the recent calls page, he sees that the contact list&#39;s
display has been updated to saying simply &#34;Jane Nym&#34; for the most
recent call.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Dr. Nym is wasting no time in placing the order for the
pizzas for the event.
She finds on her desk an advertisement for &#34;Pizza Piano&#34;, a local
pizza chain, which includes a QR code that she can scan.<sup><a id="fnr.why-a-qr-code" href="#fn.why-a-qr-code" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>
The QR code only supplied the number to be called for the local
restaurant, but Dr. Nym&#39;s phone supplies the identifier
&#34;bizdir ⇒ Pizza Piano East&#34;.
&#34;bizdir&#34; is a business directory naming hub that Dr. Nym uses which
independently verifies that local businesses are who they say they
are.
Dr. Nym is satisfied enough by this to be confident calling the
establishment and paying for pizzas.
She calls, pays, and tells the cashier who is taking the order that
Ben will be the one picking up the pizzas and handling any additional
details and supplies them with Ben&#39;s number.
</p>

<p>
Time passes, and just hours before the event Ben gets an incoming
phone call from a number he has not saved as a petname and for which
none of his contacts have provided a petname (including that Ben does
not have the same business directory Dr. Nym does as a contact
either).
&#34;Caller ID&#34; does provide an <b><b>proposed name</b></b> of &#34;Pizza Piano&#34; for this
context (though there is no guarantee that &#34;caller ID&#34; provides the
same proposed name to others for this phone number), however since this
is a contextual name and Ben&#39;s contact and phone applications do not
want Ben to be confused, this renders as &#34;Pizza Piano.2&#34;.
</p>


<p><img src="https://files.spritely.institute/papers/imgs/petnames-pictures/incoming-call-self-proclaimed-name.png" alt="incoming-call-self-proclaimed-name.png"/>
</p>

<p>
&#34;Pizza Piano&#34; is the proposed name, but Ben has already had contact with
one of the other Pizza Piano franchise locations, and so the system
distinctively marks this one as entry 2.
Ben&#39;s petname system will automatically increment this number until it
exceeds 9, at which case any new encounters with a proposed name of
&#34;Pizza Piano&#34; will simply render as &#34;Pizza Piano…&#34;
</p>

<p>
Ben answers the call; the pizza parlor employee merely wanted to let
Ben know that they were all out of olives and wanted to know if another
ingredient would be acceptable.
Even though Ben is trusting that caller ID is correct, he can&#39;t
imagine any reason why someone would be trying to phish him to
authorize a topping change, so he suggests changing from olives to
mushrooms.
Now all that&#39;s left for Ben to do is pick up the pizzas!
