    <h1>NSO group iPhone zero-click, zero-day exploit captured in the wild</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody">


                  
<p>Apple has <strong><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just issued an update for Apple products</a></strong> including iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, and Apple Watches. We encourage all users to immediately update their devices.</p>

<p>We urge all at-risk users to consider enabling Lockdown Mode as we believe it blocks this attack.</p>
<p><span>Last week, while checking the device of an individual employed by a Washington DC-based civil society organization with international offices, Citizen Lab found an actively exploited zero-click vulnerability being used to deliver NSO Group’s Pegasus mercenary spyware. </span></p>
<h2>The BLASTPASS Exploit Chain</h2>
<p>We refer to the exploit chain as BLASTPASS. The exploit chain was capable of compromising iPhones running the latest version of iOS (16.6) <em>without any interaction from the victim</em>.</p>
<p>The exploit involved <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/walletpasses/building_a_pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PassKit</a> attachments containing malicious images sent from an attacker iMessage account to the victim.</p>
<p>We expect to publish a more detailed discussion of the exploit chain in the future.</p>
<h2>Disclosure to Apple &amp; CVEs</h2>
<p>Citizen Lab immediately disclosed our findings to Apple and assisted in their investigation.</p>
<p>Apple issued two CVEs related to this exploit chain (CVE-2023-41064 and CVE-2023-41061)</p>
<h2>Update Apple Devices Now</h2>
<p><span> </span>We urge everyone to immediately update their devices.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage everyone who may face increased risk because of who they are or what they do to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT212650" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enable Lockdown Mode</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We believe, and Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture team has confirmed to us, that Lockdown Mode blocks this particular attack.</p>
<p>We commend Apple for their rapid investigative response and patch cycle, and we acknowledge the victim and their organization for their collaboration and assistance.</p>
<h2>Heavily-Targeted Civil Society: A Cybersecurity Early Warning System</h2>
<p>This latest find shows once again that civil society is targeted by highly sophisticated exploits and mercenary spyware.</p>
<p>Apple’s update will secure devices belonging to regular users, companies, and governments around the globe. The BLASTPASS discovery highlights the incredible value to our collective cybersecurity of supporting civil society organizations.</p>

<p><em>Note: Post updated 5:42PM Eastern Time Sept 7th to reflect that Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture team and Citizen Lab believe that Lockdown Mode blocks this particular attack.</em></p>
