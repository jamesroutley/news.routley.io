    <h1>Implementing the Builder Pattern in Carp</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Initializing complex objects can be a pain. Unintuitive data dependencies and aggregate members can make your life hard. As so very often, there is a design pattern that helps simplify that process: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern">the Builder pattern</a>.</p>
<p>Although the builder pattern comes from object-oriented design, it’s also useful for functional languages; in fact, today I’m going to talk about it in the context of Carp!</p>
<p>We’re going to look at how building complex data types works in idiomatic Carp, and how we can make it even better using macros. Sound good? Alright, let’s go!</p>
<h2 id="building-things-in-carp">Building things in Carp</h2>
<p>When defining a type in Carp, the compiler already creates getter, setter and update functions automatically. Combined with the threading macro <code>=&gt;</code>, this makes for a nice interface already:</p>
<pre><code>(deftype MyType [
  int Int,
  str String,
])

(defn main []
  (println*
    &amp;(=&gt; (MyType.init 1 @&#34;&#34;)
         (MyType.set-str @&#34;string&#34;)
         (MyType.update-int Int.inc)
     )
  )
)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 1: Building a simple type in Carp.
</p>
<p>But this falls short in several respects. The most obvious problem is that this only works on all-or-nothing data types. If you had an array or map as members, for instance, the ergonomics get thrown overboard. If you wanted to append to an array or add a new key-value pair to a map, the best we can do with what Carp provides us is something like this:</p>
<pre><code>(deftype (MyType2 a b c) [
  l (Array a),
  m (Map b c),
])

(defn main []
  (println*
    &amp;(=&gt; (MyType2.init [] {})
         (MyType2.update-l
           (fn [l] (Array.push-back l @&#34;elem&#34;)))
         (MyType2.update-m
           (fn [m] (Map.put @&#34;key&#34; @&#34;value&#34;)))
     )
  )
)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 2: Building a complected type in Carp.
</p>
<p>And already ergonomics get thrown overboard. That’s the first case we’d like to fix with our builder. The next problem is the classical builder problem: we have to provide a set of initial values. Ideally, we’d like to provide them bit by bit and maybe even have values that weren’t supplied to the builder be <code>zero</code>.</p>
<p>Ideally, we’ll end up with this:</p>
<pre><code>(deftype (MyType3 a b c) [
  i Int,
  l (Array a),
  m (Map b c),
])
(builder-for &#39;MyType3)

(defn main []
  (println*
    &amp;(=&gt; (MyType3Builder.init)
         (MyType3Builder.set-i 1)
         (MyType3Builder.add-to-l @&#34;elem&#34;)
         (MyType3Builder.emit))))
; =&gt; (MyType3 1 [@&#34;elem&#34;] {})</code></pre>
<p>Fig. 3: Building a complected type using the builder pattern.</p>
<p>As always with my blog posts, the solution to this problem is based on macros. First, we’re going to write macros that create setters for arrays and maps, as a kind of warm-up exercise. Once we’ve gotten this to work, we’ll try and write a macro emits a builder for a datatype passed to it.</p>
<h2 id="emitting-setters">Emitting setters</h2>
<p>For the sake of this blog post, we’re only going to emit array and macro updaters that add items. If you want to try your hands on a little challenge later, you can try to add removal or transmutation functions yourself.</p>
<p>What should the interface look like? The way that would lead to the simplest code would pass both the type and the property to us, like this:</p>
<pre><code>(array-builder MyType3 l)
(map-builder MyType3 m)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 4: A setter emission API.
</p>
<p>This makes it easy for us to figure out what to wrap. The next question we should ask ourselves is what the generated code should look like. Let’s look at the code that <code>map-builder</code> has to emit—the array version would be extremely similar.</p>
<pre><code>(defmodule MyType3
  (defn add-to-m [obj k v]
    (update-m obj &amp;(fn [map] (Map.put map k v))))
  (defn add-to-m! [obj k v]
    (Map.put! (m obj) k v)))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 5: A desugared version of the builder.
</p>
<p>We emit both in-place and functional updaters, because its cost is close to zero. The code should be pretty self-explanatory: in both cases we reuse existing functionality—<code>Map.put</code>—on our property.</p>
<p>Now that we have an API and a template, let’s get to generating!</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro map-builder [md prop]
  (list &#39;defmodule md
    (list &#39;defn (Symbol.join [&#39;add-to- prop])
                (array &#39;obj &#39;k &#39;v)
      (list (Symbol.join [&#39;update- prop]) &#39;obj
        &#39;(ref (fn [map] (Map.put map k v)))))
    (list &#39;defn (Symbol.join [&#39;add-to- prop &#39;!])
                (array &#39;obj &#39;e)
      (list &#39;Array.push-back! (list prop &#39;obj) &#39;e))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 6: The <code>map-builder</code> macro, in full.
</p>
<p>I decided to show you the whole code rather than building it up iteratively as I usually do, just because we have so much material to get through. If you look at the code we want to emit in Figure 5, however, it should be pretty clear what this macro does: it is basically just a template.</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness, let’s look at <code>array-builder</code> as well, although it is extremely similar.</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro array-builder [md prop]
  (list &#39;defmodule md
    (list &#39;defn (Symbol.join [&#39;add-to- prop])
                (array &#39;o &#39;e)
      (list (Symbol.join [&#39;update- prop]) &#39;o
            &#39;(ref (fn [a] (Array.push-back a e)))))
    (list &#39;defn (Symbol.join [&#39;add-to- prop &#39;!])
                (array &#39;o &#39;e)
      (list &#39;Array.push-back! (list prop &#39;o) &#39;e))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 7: The <code>array-builder</code> macro, in full.
</p>
<p>And that’s all the code we need for making the API of array and map building better! If you want a bit of a deeper dive into this piece of code, look at <code>builder.carp</code> in <a href="https://github.com/carpentry-org/snippets">the Carp snippets repository</a>. It’s almost exactly the same code, and it’s heavily commented for your convenience.</p>
<p>So, where are we at? We can already make code like this work now:</p>
<pre><code>(defn main []
  (println*
    &amp;(=&gt; (MyType3.init 0 [] {})
         (MyType3.add-to-m @&#34;key @&#34;value&#34;)
         (MyType3.add-to-l @&#34;elem&#34;))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 8: Setters in action.
</p>
<p>This is a huge improvement, but I think we can do better! Let’s look at how to emit a builder for the entire type!</p>
<h2 id="rummaging-through-types">Rummaging through types</h2>
<p>We’ll have to go through the type’s members, similar to what we did in <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Carp_and_derive.html">my blog post about <code>derive</code></a>. As I explained there as well, we’ll have to use <code>members</code> to get the member names and types, but, unlike last time, we’re actually going to use the type this time.</p>
<p>But before we get ahead of ourselves, we should probably dream up an API again. We want to emit a new module for each type that we hand to the macro, emitting the code we need to incrementally create that type. So the API looks a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>(builder-for &#39;MyType3)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 9: Our ideal builder API.
</p>
<p>And the code that should be generated looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>; this type should be the same as the original,
; but all fields are optional
(deftype MyType3Builder [
  i (Maybe Int),
  l (Maybe (Array a)),
  m (Maybe (Map b c)),
])

(defmodule MyType3Builder
  ; we’re adding setters that accept direct values
  (defn build-i [b e] (set-i b (Maybe.Just e)))
  (defn build-l [b e] (set-l b (Maybe.Just e)))
  (defn build-m [b e] (set-m b (Maybe.Just e)))

  ; we also build a generator
  (defn emit [b]
    (MyType3.init
      (Maybe.get-or-zero (i b))
      (Maybe.get-or-zero (l b))
      (Maybe.get-or-zero (m b))
    )
  )
)

; we’ll also emit type builders if applicable
(array-builder MyType3 l)
(map-builder MyType3 m)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 10: A large pile of generated code.
</p>
<p>That’s a lot of code to generate, but most of it is fairly formulaic. Let’s build a macro that generates this code!</p>
<h3 id="the-main-macro">The main macro</h3>
<p>The main macro is the glue that holds everything together. It will defer most of its work to dynamic functions, and will thus be relatively simple.</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro builder-for [t]
  (do
    (generate-builder-type t)
    (cons &#39;defmodule
      (cons (generate-builder-name t)
        (cons (generate-emitter t)
              (generate-setters (members t)))))
    (generate-type-builders t))
)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 11: The <code>builder-for</code> macro.
</p>
<p>The structure of this macro closely follows the structure of the generated code in Figure 9, so it should be relatively easy to figure out which function does what.</p>
<p>We’re going to go through the helper functions in order of appearance, but immediately break that rule by starting with <code>generate-builder-name</code>. We did something similar above in the map and string builders, so generating the name should be fairly simple. Let’s take a look:</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic generate-builder-name [t]
  (Symbol.join [t &#39;Builder]))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 12: The <code>generate-builder-name</code> macro.
</p>
<p>This will generate the name <code>MyType3Builder</code> from <code>MyType3</code>.</p>
<p>Next up: generating the builder type.</p>
<h3 id="generating-the-builder-type">Generating the builder type</h3>
<p>Generating the builder type should be fairly straighforward as well. We can reuse the <code>generate-builder-name</code> helper function to generate the type name, and then iterate through the original members to get our new members.</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic generate-builder-type [t]
  (list &#39;deftype (generate-builder-name t)
    (generate-builder-type-body (members t))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 13: The <code>generate-builder-type</code> macro.
</p>
<p>Once again we defer to a helper to generate the members. It should recursively build an array of members, wrapping the old members inside <code>Maybe</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic generate-builder-type-body [ms]
  (if (= (length ms) 0)
    []
    (append [(caar ms) (list &#39;Maybe (cadar ms))]
            (generate-builder-type-body (cdr ms)))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 13: The <code>generate-builder-type-body</code> macro.
</p>
<p>And we just generated a type! One down, three to go!</p>
<h3 id="generating-the-emitter">Generating the emitter</h3>
<p>The emitter is also relatively simple. We need to go through the members again, this time wrapping each of them in a function call, in order. As before, we’re going to use a combination of two dynamic functions, one for the skeleton and one that recurses over the members.</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic generate-emitter [t]
  (list &#39;defn &#39;emit (array &#39;b)
    (cons (Symbol.prefix t &#39;init)
      (generate-emitter-body (members t)))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 14: The <code>generate-emitter</code> macro.
</p>
<p>While this is a little bit more involved than the type shim, there is no magic involved. We’re using a new function, <code>Symbol.prefix</code>, that adds a module to a function—e.g. <code>(Symbol.prefix &#39;Maybe &#39;apply)</code> would evaluate to <code>Maybe.apply</code>.</p>
<p>The function that generates the emitter body looks a lot like <code>generate-builder-type-body</code> in Figure 13. They both go through the members recursively, and generate some code. The code is arguably even simpler, though.</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic generate-emitter-body [ms]
  (if (= (length ms) 0)
    ()
    (cons (list &#39;Maybe.or-zero (list (caar ms) &#39;b))
          (generate-emitter-body (cdr ms)))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 15: The <code>generate-emitter-body</code> macro.
</p>
<p>These two functions are all we need to generate the emitter body. We have the type and the emitter, now we just need to emit the setters and finally the type builders.</p>
<h3 id="generating-the-setters">Generating the setters</h3>
<p>You know the drill by now. We’re going through the members and generate some code.</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic generate-setters [ms]
  (if (= (length ms) 0)
    ()
    (cons
      (list &#39;defn (Symbol.join [&#39;build- (caar ms)])
                  [&#39;b &#39;e]
            (list (Symbol.join [&#39;set- (caar ms)])
                  &#39;b
                  &#39;(Maybe.Just e)))
      (generate-setters (cdr ms)))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 16: The <code>generate-setters</code> macro.
</p>
<p>No news here. The emitter pattern is a little more complex, but other than that we’re not doing anything new.</p>
<h3 id="generating-the-type-builders">Generating the type builders</h3>
<p>Alright, the last element on our list, and we’re mixing it up a little, too! For this part we’re going to have to check the type and only emit things when we encounter types we know how to treat.</p>
<p>Firstly, we write an entrypoint that extracts the members and calls our recursive function. You know the deal by now.</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic generate-type-builders [t]
  (generate-type-builder t (members t)))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 17: The <code>generate-type-builders</code> macro.
</p>
<p>In our recursive function we’re going to call a helper called <code>generate-type-builder-for</code> for each element in the list. In the end we’re going to return an empty list, and <code>cons</code> everything together. So far, this is pretty similar to what we did before.</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic generate-type-builder [t ms]
  (if (= (length ms) 0)
    ()
    (cons (generate-type-builder-for t (caar ms) (cadar ms))
          (generate-type-builder t (cdr ms)))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 18: The <code>generate-type-builder</code> macro.
</p>
<p>The function <code>generate-type-builder-for</code> is the only original piece of plumbing. It will match on the type of the member and generate a builder for it if we know how to do that. In this blog post, we’ve only looked at how to generate builders for maps and arrays, so that’s what we’re matching on.</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic generate-type-builder-for [t m typ]
  (if (list? typ)
    (if (= (car typ) &#39;Map)
      (list &#39;map-builder t m)
      (if (= (car typ) &#39;Array)
        (list &#39;array-builder t m)
        ()))
    ()))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 19: The <code>generate-type-builder-for</code> macro.
</p>
<p>And, finally, all of our code works! We’re able to generate the entire <code>MyType3Builder</code> module, and it works as expected!</p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>What we did in this blog post was generate a lot of very straightforward code by going through a type definition. This is what macros excel at, and we were able to cover a lot of ground in only very little code. And the macros don’t have to be incredibly clever to be useful either!</p>
<p>Generally, using macros to reduce the amount of boilerplate is a prime use case, and you’ll be able to create a lot of APIs that would otherwise be tedious to write using this technique, and learn a lot in the process!</p>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>As always, I hope you’ve enjoyed digging into macros with me. If you have any suggestions for future blog posts—no matter whether they’re macro-related or not—, please <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/blog/issues">let me know</a>!</p>
