<p><span>27 Oct 2023</span></p><p>This blog post is part of a series on file formats research. See <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2023/08/04/researching-file-formats-library-of-congress-sustainability-of-digital-formats/">this introduction post</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Digital Forensics XML, XML for your digital forensics.</p>

<p>This had me thinking about <a href="https://bitcurator.net/">BitCurator</a>, which is a toolkit that had several years of public funding, and some institutional tie-in, but now has a community group and I wasn’t sure about what the sustainability model for the project was? There’s a <a href="https://bitcuratorconsortium.org/">consortium</a>, but is the membership model sustainable?</p>

<p>So while working on this format, I spent a lot of time thinking about the fragility of grant-funded projects that don’t have a clear path to financial sustainability, to the intense instability of links (y’know, linkrot) and general web maintenance concerns. I don’t want to imply that any of the (often always wonderful) people working on these efforts are to blame; it’s just a massive amount of work that doesn’t receive a lot of attention or acknowledgement, and it’s often a very slow build-up over time. Hardly the first person to have these thoughts, just what’s been on my mind as I receive bounce-back emails or hit broken URLs with no direct replacement or backup copy.</p>

<p>I’m a bit worried about <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1aiVUMP18H3eg5cUu-3y7fiKxdvVc4Jf7YIKRh5s5ZEQ/pub?output=html">this google doc</a>, because gdocs are really sensitive to being randomly deleted from someone who doesn’t realize its useful and then disappear from the web. (It wasn’t on wayback until I manually chose for it to be captured)</p>

<p>(<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aiVUMP18H3eg5cUu-3y7fiKxdvVc4Jf7YIKRh5s5ZEQ/edit#gid=0">Here</a>is a version that you can copy and save to your own gdrive, if you’re interested.)</p>

<p>I also don’t know the date on this doc, or if it’s still useful/applicable. This was true for a lot of the content produced in-the-moment about DFXML or BitCurator.</p>

<p>There was also a good amount of information on the Forensics Wiki, which seems to have <del>gone under</del> …gone under… <a href="https://osdfir.blogspot.com/2022/11/transitioning-forensics-wiki-to-github.html">a renovation</a>, with the <a href="https://forensics.wiki/">new site here</a>. There’s still a good bit from <a href="https://forensicswiki.org/wiki/Main_Page">what’s captured</a> that is available (which is probably a lot). This only fueled my muddled thoughts around what disappears not through a death but just through not being able to be found.</p>

<p>Final unrelated thought: This talk from Alex Nelson, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bXmiy5yfO4">Enumerating and Analyzing Storage Data with DFXML</a>”, from 2015 is both educational and entertaining.</p>
