                <p>Pidgin is a chat program which lets you log into accounts on multiple chat
                    networks simultaneously. This means that you can be chatting with friends on
                    XMPP and sitting in an IRC channel at the same time.</p>
                <p>Pidgin runs on Windows, Linux, and other UNIX-like operating systems. Looking
                    for Pidgin for macOS? Try <a href="https://adium.im">Adium</a>!</p>
                <p>Pidgin is compatible with the following chat networks out of the box:
                    Jabber/XMPP, Bonjour, Gadu-Gadu, IRC, Novell GroupWise Messenger, Lotus
                    Sametime, SILC, SIMPLE, and Zephyr. It can support many more with
                    <a href="https://pidgin.im/plugins/">plugins</a>.</p>
                <p>Pidgin supports many features of these chat networks, such as file transfers,
                    away messages, buddy icons, custom smileys, and typing notifications. Numerous
                    plugins also extend Pidgin’s functionality above and beyond the standard
                    features.</p>
                <p>Pidgin is under constant development. Releases are usually frequent and driven
                    by user contributions, such as
                    <a href="https://issues.imfreedom.org/issues/PIDGIN?u=1">issues</a> and
                    <a href="https://pidgin.im/development/contributing/">contributions</a>.</p>
