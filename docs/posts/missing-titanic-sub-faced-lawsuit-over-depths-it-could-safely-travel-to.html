    <h1>Missing Titanic Sub Faced Lawsuit over Depths It Could Safely Travel To</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="app-root"><div><p><span><main id="main"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Article"><span></span><div><div><div><p>The tourist submersible that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/19/us/missing-submarine-titanic-who-is-on.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>went missing</span></a> while exploring the <i>Titanic</i> wreck was previously the target of safety complaints from an employee of OceanGate, the parent company that owns the sub and runs tourist expeditions of the wreck. That employee complained specifically that the sub was not capable of descending to such extreme depths before he was fired.</p><p><span>That’s according to legal documents obtained by </span><span><i>The New Republic</i></span><span>. According to the court documents, in a 2018 case, OceanGate employee David Lochridge, a submersible pilot, voiced concerns about the safety of the sub. According to a press release, Lochridge was director of marine operations at the time, “responsible for the safety of all crew and clients.”  <br/></span></p></div></div><div><p><span>The concerns Lochridge voiced came to light as part of a breach of contract case related to Lochridge refusing to greenlight manned tests of the early models of the submersible over safety concerns. Lochridge was fired, and then OceanGate sued him for disclosing confidential information about the Titan submersible. In response, Lochridge filed a compulsory counterclaim where he alleged wrongful termination over being a whistleblower about the quality and safety of the submersible. <br/></span></p></div><div><div><p><span>Lochridge, in his counterclaim, alleged that “rather than addressing Lochridge’s concerns, OceanGate instead summarily terminated Lochridge’s employment in efforts to silence Lochridge and to avoid addressing the safety and quality control issues.” <br/></span></p><p><span>The counterclaim said that:</span></p></div></div><div><div><blockquote><p><span>Given the prevalent flaws in the previously tested 1/3 scale model, and the visible flaws in the carbon end samples for the Titan, Lochridge again stressed the potential danger to passengers of the Titan as the submersible reached extreme depths. The constant pressure cycling weakens existing flaws resulting in large tears of the carbon. Non-destructive testing was critical to detect such potentially existing flaws in order to ensure a solid and safe product for the safety of the passengers and crew.<br/></span></p></blockquote><p><span>The counterclaim also details a meeting at OceanGate’s Everett, Washington, facility with engineering staff where “several individuals had expressed concerns over to the Engineering Director.” The OceanGate CEO, Stockton Rush, asked Lochridge to conduct a quality inspection of the Titan. Per the complaint:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Over the course of the next several days, Lochridge worked on his report and requested paperwork from the Engineering Director regarding the viewport design and pressure test results of the viewport for the Titan, along with other key information. Lochridge was met with hostility and denial of access to the necessary documentation that should have been freely available as part of his inspection process.<br/></span></p></blockquote><p><span>Lochridge initially verbally expressed concerns about the safety and quality of the Titan submersible to OceanGate executive management, but those concerns were ignored. Lochridge “identified numerous issues that posed serious safety concerns, and offered corrective action and recommendations for each.” Lochridge was particularly concerned about “non-destructive testing performed on the hull of the Titan” but he was “repeatedly told that no scan of the hull or Bond Line could be done to check for delaminations, porosity and voids of sufficient adhesion of the glue being used due to the thickness of the hull.” He was also told there was no such equipment that could conduct a test like that. <br/></span></p><p><span>After Lochridge issued his inspection report, OceanGate officials convened a meeting on January 19, 2018, with the CEO, human resources director, engineering director, Lochridge, and the operations director. Per the complaint:</span></p></div></div><div><div><blockquote><p><span>At the meeting Lochridge discovered why he had been denied access to the viewport information from the Engineering department—the viewport at the forward of the submersible was only built to a certified pressure of 1,300 meters, although OceanGate intended to take passengers down to depths of 4,000 meters. Lochridge learned that the viewport manufacturer would only certify to a depth of 1,300 meters due to experimental design of the viewport supplied by OceanGate, which was out of the Pressure Vessels for Human Occupancy (“PVHO”) standards. OceanGate refused to pay for the manufacturer to build a viewport that would meet the required depth of 4,000 meters.<br/></span></p></blockquote><p>For reference, the <i>Titanic</i> is estimated to sit on the ocean floor at a depth of nearly 13,000 feet.</p><p><span>Paying passengers wouldn’t know or be informed about Lochridge’s concerns, according to his complaints. They also wouldn’t be informed “that hazardous flammable materials were being used within the submersible.” Lochridge expressed concerns about the Titan again. But OceanGate didn’t address those concerns, and Lockridge was fired. <br/></span></p><p><span>The case between Lochridge and OceanGate didn’t advance much further, and a few months later the two parties settled. <br/></span></p></div></div><div><p><span>As of Tuesday, the Coast Guard </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/americas/live-news/titanic-submersible-missing-search-06-20-23/h_d09fa9cbdf6ddf6db97dc8bdba35fb73" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>said</span></a><span> that 10,000 square miles have been searched since the Titan submersible went missing Sunday afternoon. Five people are said to be on board, and the submarine had the capability to be underwater for about 96 hours, according to </span><i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/19/titanic-tourist-submarine-missing-north-atlantic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>The Guardian</span></a></i><span>.  <br/></span></p></div></div></article><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Article"><div><div><div><p><span>Donald Trump just keeps making his own legal troubles worse.</span></p><p><span>In a damning interview with Fox News on Monday, the twice-impeached, </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/173506/trump-indictment-phenomenal-self-own"><span>twice-indicted</span></a><span>, and liable for sexual abuse former president pretty much confessed to stealing and hoarding classified documents.</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>In the interview, Fox host Bret Baier asked Trump directly about several claims in the federal indictment against him.</span></p></div><div><div><p><span>First, Baier asked Trump why he ignored a May 2022 Justice Department subpoena to hand over any remaining classified documents in his possession. This is a key point in the case against Trump, and Trump’s lawyers had reportedly advised him to hand over all the documents and avoid charges (</span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/173665/trump-get-jail-free-card-chose-not-use-classfied-documents"><span>advice that he ignored</span></a><span>).<br/></span></p><p><span>Trump’s response was to pretty much admit he kept classified documents … but it was only because his golf shirts were in the same boxes.</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span>“Because I had boxes, I want to go through the boxes and get all my personal things out,” Trump said. “I don’t want to hand that over to [the National Archives and Records Administration] yet. And I was very busy, as you’ve sort of seen.”</span></p><p><span>Baier went on to cite the indictment against Trump, which found that the former president directly interfered to hide the documents from the Justice Department in response to the subpoena. <br/></span></p><p><span>As the indictment notes, Trump ordered an aide to move the boxes of classified documents to another location and asked his lawyers to tell the Justice Department he had fully complied with the subpoena when he hadn’t. (The indictment even says Trump </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/173500/trump-indictment-even-damning-expected"><span>told his lawyers</span></a><span> things like, “Wouldn’t it be better if we just told them we don’t have anything here?”)</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span>Trump didn’t comment on these charges, but instead replied, “Before I send boxes over, I have to take all of my things out. These boxes were interspersed with all sorts of things. Golf shirts, clothing, pants, shoes, there were many things.”</span></p><p><span>In other words, Trump may have committed a crime, but it was only because he was busy and needed to find his golf shirts and shoes … which he kept in the same boxes as highly classified national secrets, as one does.</span></p><figure><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Baier: Why not just hand them over? Trump: Because I had boxes, I want to go through the boxes and get all my personal things <a href="https://t.co/PwW85wlTzH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/PwW85wlTzH</a></p>— Acyn (@Acyn) <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1670917466036269057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">June 19, 2023</a></blockquote>  </figure><p><span>Later in the interview, Baier asked Trump about a classified Pentagon document he allegedly kept, which details a potential attack on Iran. The Justice Department has an </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/173455/trump-blew-big-hole-defense-classified-docs-probe"><span>audio recording</span></a><span> of Trump in July 2021—months after he had left the White House—bragging to other people in the room about keeping this national security document, and even admitting it was classified.</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span>“You were recorded saying that you had a document detailing a planned attack on another country that was prepared by the U.S. military for you when you were president,” Baier said. “The Iran attack plan. You remember that? You were recorded—”</span></p><p><span>“You ready?” Trump responded. “It wasn’t a document. I had lots of paper. I had copies of newspaper articles, I had copies of magazines.”</span></p><figure><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">There’s a lot going on here and this is going to reviewed: Trump on the recording of him <a href="https://t.co/JpohMqb2Li" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/JpohMqb2Li</a></p>— Acyn (@Acyn) <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1670919463837769729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">June 19, 2023</a></blockquote>  </figure><p><span>“I know,” Baier replied. “This is specifically a quote. You’re quoted on the recording saying the document was secret, adding that you could have declassified it while you were president, but ‘Now I can’t, you know this is still secret, highly confidential.’ And the indictment cites the recording and the testimony from the people in the room that you showed it to people there that day. So you say on tape that you can’t declassify it, so why have it?”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“When I said I couldn’t declassify it now, that’s because I wasn’t president,” Trump said at first, again admitting that a document existed. “When I’m not president, I can’t declassify.”</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span>When further pressed by Baier, Trump backtracked, saying no document existed and “I didn’t have a document per se.” Trump, in other words, was saying that he was lying to his guests—one of the rare times he said something that had a ring of truth.</span></p><p><span>Again, there is an audio recording of </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/173455/trump-blew-big-hole-defense-classified-docs-probe"><span>Trump bragging</span></a><span> about this document, and the indictment cites </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/173506/trump-indictment-phenomenal-self-own"><span>corroborating testimony</span></a><span> of those who were there in the room with him that day.</span></p><p><span>The second half of the Fox interview is set to be aired Tuesday evening—and Trump’s bumbling, incoherent statements may very well come up at trial, when he faces <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/173488/exact-charges-donald-trump-classified-docs-case">37 criminal charges.</a></span></p></div></div></div></article><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Article"><div><div><div><p>Joe Biden—now campaigning in earnest for president—made a pitch to climate voters on a windy stretch of California wetland on Monday.

Another $67 million is being allocated for upgrades to the electrical grid in California, where investor-owned utility PG&amp;E has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/11/business/energy-environment/pge-wildfire-settlement.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">found responsible</a> for a number of deadly fires over the last several years.</p><p>“Resiliency matters,” Biden said in a short, muted speech at the Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center and Preserve in Palo Alto. “I’ve toured many sites across the country that clearly show climate change is <i>the</i> existential threat to humanity.” </p></div></div><div><p>Much of his time at the podium was spent listing off climate-related investments provided for by the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, taking a victory lap for having defended the former from recent Republican attacks. </p></div><div><div><p>“We didn’t just protect some of the climate money and clean energy provisions. We protected every single solitary one,” Biden said. </p><p>Climate voters aren’t the only<b> </b>people Biden is trying to win over in the Golden State: Biden seems particularly eager to court Bay Area tech magnates,<b> </b>per <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-19/biden-california-climate-change-campaign-case" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reports</a> about his West Coast visit.

Later today Biden is scheduled to attend a <a href="https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/national_news/president-biden-to-visit-los-gatos-atherton-for-fundraising-events-with-tech-luminaries/article_671c4d61-2d8e-5347-8056-bdaee4a7375d.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$6,600-per-head</a> reception at the Atherton home of venture capitalist Steve Westly and his wife, Anita Yu. Biden will also meet LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott, along with prospective donors in climate tech and private equity. </p></div></div><div><div><p>Last week, the president secured <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/14/climate/environmental-groups-endorse-biden.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">early 2024 endorsements</a> from some of the country’s biggest green groups: the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and NextGen America. Despite the inarguably historic passage of the IRA last year, which marked America’s first major climate-related spending package, he may have to do more to win over climate voters angered by the White House’s support for fossil fuel projects ranging from the Mountain Valley Pipeline—bolstered by the recent debt ceiling deal—to new <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/secretary-energy-says-lng-exports-222155357.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">liquefied natural gas export facilities</a>, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/172394/willow-project-emissions-drilling">drilling in Alaska</a>, and a <a href="https://prospect.org/environment/2023-05-17-rahm-emanuels-gas-pipeline/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">gas pipeline</a> in Japan. </p><p>Recent <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/13/biden-climate-record-climate-voter-enthusiasm-gap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">polling</a> from Data for Progress found that 48 percent of likely voters under 34 are somewhat or much less likely to vote for Biden because of his “approval of new oil and gas drilling projects on public lands, such as the Willow project in Alaska.” Hours before Biden’s speech, <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2023/06/19/granholm-energy-michigan-future-gas-stoves-activists-climate-defiance/70334972007/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">protesters</a> attempted to interrupt Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm during an event in Michigan. “No MVP, no LNG, Granholm you are killing me,” activists with the group Climate Defiance chanted before being ejected from the hotel where Granholm was speaking. </p></div></div></div></article><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Article"><div><div><div><p><span>U.S. Secretary of State </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/173652/antony-blinken-can-make-peace-china">Antony Blinken</a><span> met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday, in what many hope is a sign of improving diplomatic relations. But China may be hoping for something more.</span></p><p>China’s economy is struggling after three years of strict Covid-19 restrictions. The past few weeks have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/19/business/economy/china-economy-stimulus.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">particularly bleak</a>, with investment slowing and exports shrinking. The housing market has taken a hit, and young people are struggling to find jobs, a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/15/economy/china-rate-cut-youth-unemployment-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">long-standing and growing problem</a> in the country. Neither China’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/19/business/economy/china-economy-stimulus.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">rollback</a> of Covid-19 restrictions nor its continued economic stimulus has jump-started its economy.</p></div></div><div><p><span>The meeting between Blinken and Xi could open the door to economic talks between the two countries. Former President Donald Trump imposed steep </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/168951/folly-sanctions">tariffs</a><span> on Chinese goods, making it more expensive for U.S. companies to import from China. President Joe Biden not only left those tariffs in place, but he also convinced Congress to provide large subsidies for the U.S.-based production of certain goods, further weakening China’s economy. Other countries also diversified supply chains away from China during the pandemic.</span></p></div><div><div><p><span>The growing economic and geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China led to a nadir of diplomatic relations between the countries. After months of sky-high tensions between Beijing and Washington—over alleged </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/170567/chinese-spy-balloon-furor-gop">spy balloons</a><span>, </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/173752/what-happened-biden-human-rights-agenda-modi">human rights</a><span> issues, and even </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/171372/tiktok-not-congress-biggest-social-media-problem">TikTok</a><span>—both sides seem ready to come to the table. China’s main diplomat for the Western hemisphere, Yang Tao, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-china-blinken-xi-biden-ce8bf13e5a02977a5291c001761ae0b3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">said</a><span> Blinken’s visit “marks a new beginning.”</span></p><p><span>But China did not concede to the U.S.’s main point: improved communication between their militaries. The U.S. considers better military-to-military communication key to avoiding international conflict, particularly over Taiwan. Chinese officials, however, said they are not yet ready to resume contact.</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Whatever happens next will prove to be a delicate balancing act for the </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/165497/biden-administration-declares-war-china">Biden</a><span> administration. One of Trump’s most-repeated attacks was accusing Biden of being “soft” on China. This has continued to be a major talking point among Republicans and will no doubt figure heavily during the GOP presidential primary. Biden faces a difficult political task in the coming months: Improve relations with Beijing without damaging his reelection chances. </span></p></div></div><div><div id="ContainerPlacement1"><div><section><div><p>More on U.S. Foreign Policy</p></div></section></div></div></div></article><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Article"><div><div><div><p>The case against Ron DeSantis from a Democrat’s perspective is straightforward and uncomplicated. For one thing, he’s a Republican. And not just any Republican: DeSantis has been one of the most odious and destructive governors in America since January 2019. He has been a vocal opponent not just of <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/23682263/ron-desantis-covid-19-vaccines-joseph-ladapo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">efforts to end the Covid-19 pandemic</a> but of the vaccine that did more to control it than anything else; <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/03/desantis-antivax-florida-trump" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">his anti-vaccine advocacy</a> has also spurred on anti-vaccine activists’ assault on safe, protective measures to control diseases like mumps and polio. He has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/desantis-signs-dont-say-gay-expansion-gender-affirming-care-ban-rcna84698" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">relentlessly attacked his state’s LGBTQ population</a>, signing draconian bills into law that aid the false, dangerous idea that these people are “groomers.” His efforts in Florida have practically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/22/books/book-ban-florida.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">single-handedly brought back book banning</a> to America, an extremely troubling development. On top of that, he is, on most issues, a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/politics/kfile-ron-desantis-privatize-social-security-medicare/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bog-standard Republican</a>: He wants to cut benefits for the poor and pass massive tax cuts for the rich. He is also, it almost goes without mentioning at this point, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/171102/ron-desantis-media-trump-2024">grotesque and charismaless</a>, and a phenomenally unappealing figure. He has no juice. </p><p>Writing in <i>The Orlando Sentinel </i>on Monday, William Cooper—a Democrat and author of <i>Stress Test: How Donald Trump Threatens American Democracy,</i> a book with one of the most non–[citation needed] titles in the history of American publishing—<a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2023/06/18/democrats-case-for-desantis/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">made the case</a> that none of that actually matters because DeSantis went to Harvard and Yale. Here’s Cooper: </p></div></div><div><div><blockquote><p>But unlike Biden and Trump, DeSantis passes the litmus test. He’s very competent. A Yale- and Harvard-educated lawyer, DeSantis served in the Navy (including on a tour in Iraq) before entering Congress and then becoming Florida’s governor. And he’s effectively achieved his objectives in Florida—regarding both politics and policy.</p><p>DeSantis’ competence matters. Why? Because the most important quality to have in a U.S. president is competence. The biggest questions facing the country do not fall comfortably along some left-right axis but instead require prudent and empirically effective leadership to address. How should we approach our global rivalry with China? How should we regulate artificial intelligence? How should we participate in an international economy complicated by dysfunction and violence around the world? And so on.…</p><p>A simple question establishes the point. Which candidate would be better at the helm in a global crisis: an 80-year-old who can’t walk straight (Joe Biden); a 76-year-old with the emotional intelligence of a 10-year-old (Donald Trump); or a 44-year-old Harvard-law-trained Navy vet who skillfully runs his home state (Ron DeSantis)?</p></blockquote><p>This is an argument that reduces politics to pure aesthetics—there is no mention of anything DeSantis could do that affects people’s lives in any way. Cooper produces no evidence that DeSantis <i>is </i>“skillfully” managing his home state; he addresses none of the policies that DeSantis has pursued in Florida. The office of the presidency is reduced to an almost symbolic one in which DeSantis is effective simply because he fits some sort of preordained model of what a president should look like (and also because, unlike Trump and Biden, he is not old). Similarly, there is no mention that Biden <i>has</i> skillfully managed an international crisis—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ron DeSantis has spent most of the last two years losing a war against Disney. </p></div></div><div><div><p>It gets worse: </p><blockquote><p>Indeed, domestic issues matter less and less the more interconnected the world gets—and it’s getting exponentially more interconnected as time marches on. This, in turn, decreases the relevance of a president’s political party and increases the importance of a president’s competence. Far better to get the culture wars wrong but get China right than vice versa. Same with taxation: Better to tilt the code a little more toward the rich if it means we also get smarter regulations protecting humanity from the downside of artificial intelligence. Appoint conservative judges all day long if it means America’s international effectiveness and leadership improves. America’s domestic squabbles just don’t mean as much as they used to. And it’s a sign of our national decadence and complacency that our political focus is nonetheless still insular and myopic. The world is a dangerous and complicated place and the president of the United States should be—above all else—very good at dealing with global challenges.</p></blockquote><p>Setting aside the myopia of this argument—issues that don’t interest Cooper, like gay rights, are reduced to baubles to be cast aside so that we can “regulate artificial intelligence,” whatever he means by that—none of this actually applies to DeSantis. There is no evidence that he could manage foreign affairs any better than Biden or, for that matter, Trump. There is significant evidence that he would arguably make lives for vulnerable people—LGBTQ people and poor people, in particular—worse than Trump.  </p></div></div><div><p>DeSantis’s appeal has largely always been this abstract. He does <i>seem</i> more normal than Trump. There are no tweetstorms at three in the morning. There are no indictments about mishandling classified information. And yet, despite the fact that he’s young and possesses his faculties, DeSantis remains a damaging political force. All you have to do is look at what he’s actually doing and saying. </p></div></div><div><div id="ContainerPlacement1"><div><section><div><p>More on the Interminable 2024 GOP Primary</p></div></section></div></div></div></article><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Article"><div><div><div><p><span>Donald Trump is </span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/donald-trump-evidence-safe-boxes-trial-1234774253/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">banned</a><span> from talking on social media about evidence in the classified documents case, thanks to a protective order issued Monday.</span></p><p><span>Trump pleaded not guilty last week to </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/173488/exact-charges-donald-trump-classified-docs-case">37 counts</a><span> of keeping classified information without authorization, making false statements, and conspiring to obstruct justice.

Podcaster and conspiracy theorist Joe Rogan and profoundly unfunny Twitter CEO Elon Musk spent the weekend trying to bully him into debating Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the efficacy of vaccines. </p><p>The saga started on Saturday, when Hotez <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7zz9z/spotify-rogan-rfk-vaccine-misinformation-policy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">shared a Vice article</a> about how Spotify—which signed Rogan to a multiyear exclusive contract in 2021 that is rumored to be worth $200 million—has stopped “even trying to stem” the podcast host’s “vaccine misinformation,” which was focused on Rogan’s three-hour-long interview with Kennedy. “Peter, if you claim what RFKjr is saying is ‘misinformation’ I am offering you $100,000.00 to the charity of your choice if you’re willing to debate him on my show with no time limit,” Rogan <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-peter-hotez-says-he-wont-debate-rfk-jr-after-weekend-of-rogan-musk-taunts-fd02055d" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tweeted</a>.

Given the popularity and influence of Rogan’s show, there are persuasive arguments for appearing, if only to correct the wild statements that are frequently shared about not just the Covid-19 vaccine but <i>all</i> vaccines. But appearing with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would likely only legitimize those views. Kennedy has spent more than a decade spouting conspiracy theories with no basis in fact about vaccines.
