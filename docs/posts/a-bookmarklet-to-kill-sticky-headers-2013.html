    <h1>A bookmarklet to kill sticky headers (2013)</h1>

    <p>There is currently a trend for using sticky headers on websites. There&#39;s even <a href="http://www.hellobar.com/">a sticky header web startup</a>.</p>
<p>I hate sticky headers. <em>I want to kill sticky headers.</em></p>
<p>So I made this bookmarklet. Drag the link to your bookmarks bar:</p>
<p>Kill Sticky</p>


<p>I use an 11&#34; MacBook Air, which means that I don&#39;t have much vertical screen space. The 50 pixels taken up by the sticky header could have been three lines of text.</p>
<p>I also normally scroll down using the space key, which scrolls just less than one full viewport at a time. When you cover up part of your content with a sticky element, that means that the space key scrolls too far down. Then I lose my position and have to scroll back up.</p>
<p>Finally, I just don&#39;t care right now about navigating your website, or following you on Twitter. I&#39;m trying to read. Let me focus on that for now, please.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-bookmarklet-works">How the bookmarklet works</h2>
<p>It&#39;s really simple, because <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api/#examples"><code>querySelectorAll</code></a> is awesome. <a href="https://gist.github.com/alisdair/5670341">Here&#39;s the source</a>:</p>
<pre><code>(<span><span>function</span> (<span></span>) </span>{ 
  <span>var</span> i, elements = <span>document</span>.querySelectorAll(<span>&#39;body *&#39;</span>);

  <span>for</span> (i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; elements.length; i++) {
    <span>if</span> (getComputedStyle(elements[i]).position === <span>&#39;fixed&#39;</span>) {
      elements[i].parentNode.removeChild(elements[i]);
    }
  }
})();
</code></pre>
<p>The bookmarklet just finds all fixed-position elements on the page, and removes them. This might remove the navigation, but if you need it back, just hit refresh. That&#39;s why I created a bookmarklet and not a custom user-stylesheet or browser plugin: this is the simplest way to solve the problem.</p>
