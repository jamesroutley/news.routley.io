    <h1>Teach, Don&#39;t Tell (2013)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-blog-entry"><article><p>Posted on September 3rd, 2013.</p><p>This post is about writing technical documentation.  More specifically: it&#39;s
about writing documentation for programming languages and libraries.</p>

<p>I love reading great documentation.  When I have a question and the
documentations explains the answer almost as if the author has magically
anticipated my problem, I get a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.  I feel a connection
with the writer that makes me smile.</p>

<p>I also love writing documentation.  Being able to rewire the neurons in
someone&#39;s brain so that they understand something they didn&#39;t understand before
is extremely satisfying.  Seeing (or hearing about) the &#34;click&#34; when a bunch of
concepts suddenly fall together and make sense never fails to make my day.</p>

<p>This post is going to be about what I think good documentation is and how
I think you should go about writing it.  I&#39;m not perfect, so you should take
everything with a grain of salt, but I hope you&#39;ll find it useful and
thought-provoking even if you don&#39;t agree with me about everything.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to say thanks to <a href="http://craigzheng.com/">Craig Zheng</a> and <a href="http://honza.ca/">Honza Pokorny</a> for
proofreading this.</p>

<h2 id="s1-prior-reading"><a href="#s1-prior-reading">Prior Reading</a></h2>

<p>Before you read this post there are two other things I think you should read
first.</p>

<p>The first is Jacob Kaplan-Moss&#39; <a href="http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/">Writing Great Documentation</a> series.  He&#39;s
certainly more qualified than I am to write about this stuff, so you should
check that out if you haven&#39;t already.  A lot of what I say here is going to
agree with and build on the ideas he talked about.</p>

<p>The other thing you should read is <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.877,y.0,no.,content.true,page.1,css.print/issue.aspx">The Science of Scientific Writing</a> by
George Gopen and Judith Swan.  Don&#39;t be put off by the fact that it&#39;s written
for scientists publishing papers in journals.  Everything in that article
applies equally well to programmers writing technical docs.  Read the entire
thing.  It&#39;s worth it.</p>

<h2 id="s2-why-do-we-document"><a href="#s2-why-do-we-document">Why Do We Document?</a></h2>

<p>Let&#39;s get started.  The first thing to nail down is <em>why</em> we&#39;re documenting
a programming language or library in the first place.  There are many things you
might want to accomplish, but I&#39;m going to boil them down into a single
statement:</p>

<p><strong>The purpose of technical documentation is to take someone who has never seen
your project, teach them to be an expert user of it, and support them once they
become an expert.</strong></p>

<p>At first glance this probably doesn&#39;t seem too controversial or interesting.
But there&#39;s one word in there that makes <em>all</em> the difference, and it frames my
entire perspective on documentation.</p>

<h2 id="s3-teaching"><a href="#s3-teaching">Teaching</a></h2>

<p>If you want to take a person who has never played the guitar and turn them into
a virtuoso guitarist, how can you do that?</p>

<p>You <em>teach</em> them.</p>

<p>If you want to take a high school student and turn them into a computer
scientist, how can you do that?</p>

<p>You <em>teach</em> them.</p>

<p>If you want to take a programmer who has never seen your library before and turn
them into an expert user of it, how can you do that?</p>

<p>You <em>teach</em> them!</p>

<p>Guitar lessons are usually taught in person, one-on-one, with a teacher.
Computer Science is usually taught by professors in classrooms.  Programming
library usage is usually taught by documentation.</p>

<p>If the goal of documentation is to turn novices into experts, then <em>the
documentation must teach</em>.  You should think of your documentation as a lesson
(or series of lessons) because <em>that&#39;s what it is</em>.</p>

<p>When writing technical documentation you (usually) don&#39;t have the advantage of
having a one-on-one dialog with the learners.  This makes it a bit more
difficult, but not impossible as long as you&#39;re careful.  Your documentation
needs to fill the role of both the in-person lessons <em>and</em> the textbook.</p>

<p>The rest of this post will be almost entirely about how to apply the
&#34;documentation is teaching&#34; mindset to writing programming docs.</p>

<h2 id="s4-a-play-in-seven-acts"><a href="#s4-a-play-in-seven-acts">A Play in Seven Acts</a></h2>

<p>I&#39;m going to break up the content of this post with some venting about <em>bad</em>
documentation.  If you want to skip these little rants, go ahead.</p>

<p>Each act in our play has two characters: a teenager and a parent.  The teenager
has just turned sixteen and would like to learn to drive so they can hang out
with their friends without relying on their parents to drive them everywhere.</p>

<p>Each act will demonstrate a caricature of a particularly <em>bad</em> form of
documentation.  I hope these little metaphors will help show why certain forms
of documentation are ineffective cop-outs and why you should write <em>real</em>
documentation instead.</p>

<h2 id="s5-act-1-read-the-source"><a href="#s5-act-1-read-the-source">Act 1: &#34;Read the Source&#34;</a></h2>

<p>Our play starts with a son and father sitting at the breakfast table.  The son
is munching on some cereal before school while the father reads his iPad before
leaving for work.</p>

<p>The son says: &#34;Hey Dad, you said you were going to teach me how to drive after
school today.  Are we still going to do that?&#34;</p>

<p>The father, without looking up from his iPad, replies: &#34;Of course, son.  The car
is in the garage and I laid out a set of wrenches on the workbench.  Take the
car apart and look at each piece, then put it back together.  Once you&#39;ve done
that I&#39;ll take you to the DMV for your driving test.&#34;</p>

<p>The son quietly continued eating his cereal.</p>

<p>If you use many open source libraries you&#39;ve undoubtedly encountered some whose
README says something like &#34;read the source&#34;.  Every time I see one, I die
a little bit inside.</p>

<p>Source code is <em>not</em> documentation.  Can you learn to be a guitarist by simply
listening to a piece of music intently?  Can you become a painter by visiting
a lot of museums?  Of course not!</p>

<p>Let me be clear: I&#39;m not trying to say that reading source code isn&#39;t a valuable
thing to do.  It is!</p>

<p>Looking at other artists&#39; paintings is extremely useful <em>once you know how to
paint</em>.  Learning how the brakes of a car are constructed can save your life,
<em>once you know how to drive</em>.</p>

<p>Once your library&#39;s users know how to work with it, reading its source is
absolutely worth their time.  But you can&#39;t look at the finished product and
understand the perspective and ideas that went into it without additional
guidance.  That&#39;s a job for documentation.</p>



<p>Writing good documentation doesn&#39;t take much in the way of tools.</p>

<p>For example: you don&#39;t need a thesaurus.  Don&#39;t try to avoid using the same
words by substituting synonyms.  Just talk to your users like you would talk to
another human being in real life!</p>

<p>If you use the same word ten times in a row your readers probably won&#39;t even
notice.  But I guarantee they&#39;re going to notice if you throw in strange,
uncommon words for no good reason.</p>

<p>There are two tools I <em>will</em> recommend before moving on.  The first isn&#39;t
actually a tool, but a skill.</p>

<p>To write great documentation, you need to be able to type.</p>

<p>When you write docs you&#39;ll inevitably write yourself into a corner and realize
you need to take a new direction.  If you don&#39;t type quickly, you might be
hesitant to throw away writing that doesn&#39;t really work.  You need to learn to
type well so you don&#39;t feel bad throwing away a chunk of a thousand words that
don&#39;t fit.</p>

<p>Steve Yegge&#39;s article <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html">Programming&#39;s Dirty Little Secret</a> is
a great rant on this topic.</p>

<p>You should also get yourself a nice keyboard.  A good keyboard won&#39;t make you
a good writer (just like a good guitar won&#39;t make you a good guitarist), but it
<em>will</em> make you want to write more just for the sheer joy of using
a well-designed piece of equipment.</p>

<p>I started practicing guitar a lot more after I got a new guitar that was much
nicer than my old one.  If you spend a hundred dollars, get a nice keyboard, and
end up wanting to write more, it was worth it!</p>

<p>Be thankful that a nice keyboard only costs $100 to $300 and not several
thousand dollars like a nice instrument.</p>

<h2 id="s7-act-2-read-the-tests"><a href="#s7-act-2-read-the-tests">Act 2: &#34;Read the Tests&#34;</a></h2>

<p>The next scene opens with a mother picking her daughter up from high school.</p>

<p>&#34;Hi Mom&#34;, she says, &#34;are you still going to teach me to drive today?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yep!&#34; she replies.  &#34;Let&#39;s get going.&#34;</p>

<p>After ten minutes of driving they arrive at the Chevrolet factory.</p>

<p>The girl looks around, puzzled.  She asks: &#34;What are we doing here?&#34;</p>

<p>The mother smiles and says: &#34;You&#39;re in luck, honey, my friend Jim works here at
the Chevy plant, and he&#39;s gonna let you watch a few crash tests of the new
Malibu!  Once you see a few cars smash into each other, I&#39;ll take you down to
the DMV for your driving test.&#34;</p>

<p>Another common form of &#34;documentation&#34; is the README instructing users to &#34;read
the tests&#34;.</p>

<p>Tests aren&#39;t docs.</p>

<p>Again, let&#39;s be clear: once you already know how to use a library, reading the
tests is <em>very</em> useful.  But you need documentation to make you an expert user
first!</p>

<p>You don&#39;t learn to drive by watching crash tests.  But learning how your car
behaves during a crash can save your life <em>once you know how to drive</em>.</p>

<p>A common argument I see goes something like this:</p>

<p>&#34;The tests use the library, so they&#39;re a good example of how to use it!&#34;</p>

<p>This is true in some very superficial sense, but completely misses the mark.</p>

<p>Most of the tests are probably going to deal with edge cases.  Edge cases are
things a normal user won&#39;t be encountering very often (otherwise they wouldn&#39;t
be edge cases!).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re lucky, you might get a test that verifies the library works correctly
on a normal set of input.  But a &#34;normal set of input&#34; is what the users are
going to be working with the majority the time!</p>

<p>Tests simply aren&#39;t a good guide to what a user is going to be encountering on
a day-to-day basis.  They can&#39;t teach a novice to be an expert.</p>

<h2 id="s8-how-to-teach"><a href="#s8-how-to-teach">How to Teach</a></h2>

<p>If you accept my idea that the purpose of documentation is to <em>teach</em> users, the
next question is obviously: &#34;How do I teach my users?&#34;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been lucky enough to have the chance to teach dancing semi-formally for
around 6 or 7 years, and lots of various other things informally for a long
time.  The only way to <em>really</em> learn how to teach is to <em>do it</em>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no substitute for sitting down with someone face-to-face and teaching
them something.  <strong>If you want to write better documentation, you need to
practice teaching</strong>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about writing out lesson plans or anything nearly so formal.  Do
you have a hobby (not programming)?  If so, spend a couple of hours on a weekend
teaching a friend about it.  You&#39;ll get some practice teaching and they&#39;ll get
to learn something new.</p>

<p>(If you don&#39;t have any non-programming hobbies, maybe you should find some.)</p>

<p>If you like photography, teach someone the basics of exposure and composition.
If you dance, teach them some basic steps.  If you play an instrument, teach
them how to play a simple song.  If you like camping, teach them what all the
gear is for.  You get the idea.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t go overboard.  You don&#39;t need to give someone a degree, you just need to
practice teaching a little bit.  You need to practice the art of rewiring
someone&#39;s neurons with your words.</p>

<p>Once you jump into teaching something (even something simple) you&#39;ll probably
realize that although you know how to do it yourself, it&#39;s a lot harder to teach
someone else.</p>

<p>This is obvious when you&#39;re working face-to-face with someone.  When you tell
them how to play a C major chord on the guitar and they only produce a strangled
squeak, it&#39;s clear that you need to slow down and talk about how to press down
on the strings properly.</p>

<p>As programmers, we almost <em>never</em> get this kind of feedback about our
documentation.  We don&#39;t see that the person on the other end of the wire is
hopelessly confused and blundering around because they&#39;re missing something we
thought was obvious (but wasn&#39;t).  Teaching someone in person helps you learn to
anticipate this, which will pay off (for your users) when you&#39;re writing
documentation.</p>

<p>With all that said, I do want to also talk a little about the actual process of
teaching.</p>

<p>The best description of how to teach that I&#39;ve seen so far is from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/069111966X/?tag=stelos-20">How
to Solve It</a>.  Everyone who wants to teach should read this book.  The passage
that really jumped out at me is right in the first page of the first chapter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best [way for the teacher to help their student] is to help the student
naturally.  The teacher should put himself in the student&#39;s place, he should
see the student&#39;s case, he should try to understand what is going on in the
student&#39;s mind, and ask a question or indicate a step that <em>could have
occurred to the student himself</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, right here, is the core of teaching.  This is it.  This is how you do it.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t learn by simply absorbing lots of unstructured information as it&#39;s
thrown at them.  You can&#39;t read a Spanish dictionary to someone to teach them
Spanish.</p>

<p>When you want to teach someone you need to put yourself in their shoes and walk
along the path with them.  Hold their hand, guide them around the dangerous
obstacles and catch them when they fall.  <em>Don&#39;t</em> carry them.  <em>Certainly
don&#39;t</em> just drive them to the destination in your car!</p>

<p>The process needs to go something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Figure out what they already know.</li>
<li>Figure out what you want them to know after you finish.</li>
<li>Figure out a single idea or concept that will move state 1 a little bit
   closer to state 2.</li>
<li>Nudge the student in the direction of that idea.</li>
<li>Repeat until state 1 becomes state 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>Too often I see documentation that has very carefully considered step 2, and
then simply presents it to the reader as a pronouncement from God.  That isn&#39;t
teaching.  That&#39;s telling.  People don&#39;t learn by being <em>told</em>, they
learn by being <em>taught</em>.</p>

<h2 id="s9-act-3-literate-programming"><a href="#s9-act-3-literate-programming">Act 3: &#34;Literate Programming&#34;</a></h2>

<p>The third act opens with a daughter talking to her mother the day before her
sixteenth birthday.</p>

<p>&#34;Hey Mom,&#34; she says, &#34;I don&#39;t know if you got me a present yet, but if not, what
I&#39;d <em>really</em> like for my birthday are driving lessons.&#34;</p>

<p>The mother smiles and says: &#34;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s all taken care of.  Just wait for
tomorrow.&#34;</p>

<p>The next day at her birthday party she unwraps the present from her mom.  Inside
is a DVD of the show How It&#39;s Made.  She looks quizzically at her mother.</p>

<p>&#34;That DVD has an episode about the factory that builds your car!  Once you watch
the whole thing I&#39;ll take you for your driving test.&#34;</p>

<p>A horrible trend I&#39;ve noticed lately is using &#34;literate programming&#34; tools like
Docco, Rocco, etc and telling users to read the results for documentation.</p>

<p>Programming languages and libraries are tools.  Knowing how a tool was made
doesn&#39;t mean you know how to use it.  When you take guitar lessons, you don&#39;t
visit a luthier to watch her shape a Telecaster out of Ash wood.</p>

<p>Knowing how your car was built can help you, <em>once you know how to drive</em>.</p>

<p>Knowing how your guitar was built can help you, <em>once you know how to play</em>.</p>

<p>A common theme throughout these acts/rants is that all of these things I&#39;m
picking on (source, tests, literate programming, and more) are good things with
real benefits <em>once you have actual documentation in place to teach users</em>. </p>

<p>But until that happens, they&#39;re actually <em>bad</em> because they let you pretend
you&#39;ve written documentation and your job is done (JKM mentions this in his
series).  Your job is not done until you&#39;ve taught your users enough to become
experts.  <em>Then</em> they can take advantage of all these extras.</p>

<h2 id="s10-the-anatomy-of-good-documentation"><a href="#s10-the-anatomy-of-good-documentation">The Anatomy of Good Documentation</a></h2>

<p>The rest of this post is going to be about the individual components that make
up good documentation.  My views are pretty similar to JKM&#39;s, so if you haven&#39;t
read the series I mentioned in the first section you should probably do that.</p>

<p>In my mind I divide good documentation into roughly four parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>First Contact</li>
<li>The Black Triangle</li>
<li>The Hairball</li>
<li>The Reference</li>
</ol>

<p>There don&#39;t necessarily have to be four separate documents for each of these.
In fact the first two can usually be combined into a single file, while the last
two should probably be split into many pieces.  But I think each component is
a distinct, important part of good documentation.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at each.</p>



<p>When you release a new programming language or library into the wild, the
initial state of your &#34;users&#34; is going to be blank.  The things they need
to know when they encounter your library are:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is this thing?</li>
<li>Why would I care about this thing?</li>
<li>Is it worth the effort to learn this thing?</li>
</ol>

<p>Your &#34;first contact&#34; documentation should explain these things to them.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to explain things from first principles.  Try to put yourself in
the shoes of your users.  When you&#39;re teaching your teenager to drive, you don&#39;t
need to explain what a &#34;wheel&#34; is.  They probably have some experience with
&#34;things on wheels that you move around in&#34; like lawn mowers or golf carts (or
even video games).</p>

<p>Likewise: if you&#39;re creating a web framework, most of the people that stumble on
to your project are probably going to know what &#34;HTML&#34; is.  It&#39;s good to err
a little bit on the side of caution and explain a little more than to assume too
much, but you can be practical here.</p>

<p>Your &#34;first contact&#34; docs should explain what, in plain words, your thing does.
It should show someone why they should care about that.  Will it save them time?
Will it take more time, but be more stable in exchange?  Is it just plain fun?</p>

<p>For bonus points, you can also mention why someone might want to <em>not</em> use your
project.  Barely anyone ever mentions the tradeoffs involved with using their
work, so to see a project do this is refreshing.</p>

<p>Finally, the user needs to know if it&#39;s worth spending some of their finite
amount of time on this planet learning more about your project.  You should
explicitly spell out things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>What license the project uses (so they know if it&#39;s practical to use).</li>
<li>Where the bug tracker is (so they can see issues).</li>
<li>Where the source code is (so they can see if it&#39;s (relatively) recently
  maintained).</li>
<li>Where the documentation is (so they can skim it and get an idea of the effort
  that&#39;s going to be involved in becoming an expert).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="s12-act-4-read-the-docstrings"><a href="#s12-act-4-read-the-docstrings">Act 4: &#34;Read the Docstrings&#34;</a></h2>

<p>Scene four.  A father is finally making good on his promise to give his daughter
driving lessons.</p>

<p>&#34;Okay Dad,&#34; she says, &#34;I&#39;m ready.  I&#39;ve never driven a car before.  Where do we
start?&#34;</p>

<p>A woman in her mid-forties walks through the door.  &#34;Who&#39;s this?&#34; the daughter
asks.</p>

<p>&#34;This is your driving teacher, Ms. Smith.&#34; the father replies.  &#34;She&#39;s going to
sit in the passenger seat with you while you drive the two hour trip to visit
grandpa.  If you have any questions about a part of the car while you&#39;re
driving, you can ask her and she&#39;ll tell you all about that piece.  Here are
the keys, good luck!&#34;</p>

<p>In languages with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring">docstrings</a> there&#39;s a tendency to write great docstrings
and call them documentation.  I&#39;m sure the &#34;doc&#34; in the word &#34;docstrings&#34;
contributes to this.</p>

<p>Docstrings don&#39;t provide any organization or order (beyond &#34;the namespace they
happen to be implemented in&#34;).  Users need to somehow know the name of the
function they need to even be able to <em>see</em> the docstring, and they can&#39;t know
that unless you <em>teach</em> them.</p>

<p>Again, docstrings are great <em>once you know the project</em>.  But when you&#39;re
teaching a novice how to use your library, you need to guide them along they
way and not sit back and answer questions when they manage to guess a magic
word correctly.</p>

<h2 id="s13-the-black-triangle"><a href="#s13-the-black-triangle">The Black Triangle</a></h2>

<p>The next important piece of documentation is <a href="http://rampantgames.com/blog/2004/10/black-triangle.html">the &#34;black triangle&#34;</a>.  It
should be a relatively short guide to getting your project up and running so the
user can poke at it.</p>

<p>This serves a couple of purposes.  First, it lets the user verify that yes, this
collection of bytes is actually going to run and <em>do something</em> on their
machine.  It&#39;s a quick sanity check that the project hasn&#39;t bit rotted and is
still viable to use at that point in time.  More importantly, it lets your
prospective user <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/#react">get some paint on the canvas</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine if you went to your first guitar lesson and the teacher said: &#34;Okay,
we&#39;re going to start by learning 150 different chords.  Then in about six months
we can play some songs.&#34;  No guitar teacher does that.  They teach you three
chords and give you a couple of cheesy pop songs to play.  It helps the student
get a feel for what being a guitarist as a whole is going to be like, and it
gives them something to help keep their interest.</p>

<p>Your &#34;black triangle&#34; documentation should be a short guide that runs the user
through the process of retrieving, installing, and poking your project or
language.</p>

<p>&#34;Short&#34; here is a relative word.  Some projects are going to require more setup
to get running.  If the benefits are enough to justify the effort, that&#39;s not
necessarily a problem.  But try to keep this as short as possible.  <em>Just get

<p>Our next scene opens a year after the last, with the father from the last scene
talking to his son.</p>

<p>(Sadly, the daughter in that scene died in a car crash because she didn&#39;t know
to ask Ms. Smith about seatbelts before getting on the expressway.  Ms.  Smith
was wearing hers, of course.)</p>

<p>&#34;Okay son, I know you&#39;re a little scared of driving because of what happened to
your sister, but I&#39;ve fixed the problem.&#34;</p>

<p>He hands the young man an inch-thick book.  &#34;Asking Ms. Smith questions along
the way clearly didn&#39;t work, so we had her write out a paragraph or two about
each piece of your car.  Go ahead and read the entire manual cover to cover and
then drive down to see grandpa.&#34;</p>

<p>API documentation is like the user&#39;s manual of a car.  When something goes wrong
and you need to replace a tire it&#39;s a godsend.  But if you&#39;re learning to drive
it&#39;s not going to help you because <em>people don&#39;t learn by reading alphabetized
lists of disconnected information</em>.</p>

<p>If you actually try to teach someone to use your project face-to-face, you&#39;ll
probably find yourself talking about things in one namespace for a while, then
switching to another to cover something related, then switching back to the
first.  Learning isn&#39;t a straight path through the alphabet, it&#39;s a zig-zaggy
ramble through someone else&#39;s brain.</p>

<h2 id="s15-the-hairball"><a href="#s15-the-hairball">The Hairball</a></h2>

<p>This brings me to the next type of documentation: &#34;the hairball&#34;.  By now the
user has hopefully seen the &#34;first contact&#34; docs and the &#34;black triangle&#34; docs.
You&#39;ve got them hooked and ready to learn, but they&#39;re still novices.</p>

<p>The &#34;hairball&#34; is the twisted, tangled maze of teaching that is going to take
these novices and turn them into expert users.  It&#39;s going to mold their brains,
one nudge at a time, until they have a pretty good understanding of how your
project works.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll usually want to organize the &#34;hairball&#34; into sections (unless this is
a very small project).  These sections will probably <em>kind of</em> line up with
namespaces in your project&#39;s public API, but when it makes sense to deviate you
should do so.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be afraid to write.  Be concise but err on the side of explaining a bit
too much.  Programmers are pretty good at skimming over things they already
know, but if you forget to include a crucial connection it can leave your users
lost and stumbling around in the woods.</p>

<p>You should have a table of contents that lists each section of the &#34;hairball&#34;.
And then each section should have its own table of contents that lists the
sections inside it.  A table of contents is a wonderful way to get a birds-eye
view of what you&#39;re about to read, to prepare your brain for it.  And of
course it&#39;s also handy for navigating around.</p>

<p>This is where your hobby-teaching practice and your reading of How to Solve It
are going to come in handy.  Put yourself in a user&#39;s brain and figure out each
little connective leap they&#39;re going to need to make to become an expert.</p>

<h2 id="s16-act-6-read-the-wiki"><a href="#s16-act-6-read-the-wiki">Act 6: &#34;Read the Wiki&#34;</a></h2>

<p>In the penultimate scene, a mother has signed her teenage son up for an
after-school driving class.</p>

<p>On the first day, the teacher hands them a syllabus detailing what they&#39;re going
to cover, talks about grading, and sends them home a bit early.</p>

<p>On the second day, she gives them a brief overview of the various pieces of
a car and how they work together.  She also talks about a few of the most
important laws they&#39;ll need to be aware of.</p>

<p>On the third day, the teacher calls in sick and they have a substitute.  He
covers the material for half of the fifth day in the syllabus.  He has to leave
early, so he brings in his nineteen year old daughter to finish the class.
She covers the first half of the fourth day&#39;s material.</p>

<p>The fourth day the students arrive to find a note on the door saying the class
has been cancelled because the teacher is still sick and they can&#39;t find
a substitute.  There&#39;s a note saying &#34;TODO: we&#39;ll talk about the material
later.&#34;</p>

<p>The fifth day the teacher has partially recovered, so she returns and covers the
material for the fifth day.  It&#39;s a bit hard to understand her because she&#39;s had
half a bottle of Nyquil and is slurring most of her words and keeps saying
&#34;cat&#34; instead of &#34;car&#34;.</p>

<p>All the students fail the driving test.</p>

<p>Wikis are an abomination.  They are the worst form of &#34;documentation&#34;.</p>

<p>First of all: assuming they work as intended, they have no coherent voice.</p>

<p>Have you ever taken a class with multiple teachers at once?  Probably not,
because it doesn&#39;t work very well (with exceptions for things like partnered
dancing where there are distinct lead/follow parts).</p>

<p>Worse still: have you ever taken a class where there&#39;s one jackass in the room
who keeps constantly raising his hand and offering his own (often incorrect)
opinions?  Wikis are like that, except they <em>actively encourage</em> random people
to interrupt the teacher with their own interjections.</p>

<p>I can hear the objections now: &#34;But putting our docs on a wiki means <em>anyone</em>
can fix typos!&#34;</p>

<p>Jesus.  Christ.</p>

<p>&#34;It makes it easy to fix typos&#34; is a horrible argument for using a wiki.</p>

<p>First of all, as JKM says, you should have an editor (or at least someone to
proofread) which will catch a lot of the typos.</p>

<p>And even if there <em>are</em> typos, they&#39;re one of the least important things you
need to worry about anyway.  Misspelling &#34;their&#34; isn&#39;t going to impact the
effectiveness of your teaching very much.  Your lessons being a disorganized
mess because they were written by three different people across six months <em>is</em>
going to make them less effective.</p>

<p>Keeping your documentation in a wiki also makes it hard or impossible to keep it
where it belongs: in version control right alongside your code.</p>

<p>But all that is irrelevant because aside from Wikipedia itself and video game
wikis, <em>they don&#39;t fucking work</em>.</p>

<p>The project maintainer sets up a wiki, sits back and pats herself on the back
saying: &#34;I have set up a way for other people to do this boring job of writing
documentation for me.  Now we wait.&#34; </p>

<p>Maybe one or two people fix some typos.  A dude who thinks he understands
a topic but actually doesn&#39;t writes some completely wrong docs.  Maybe they get
reverted, maybe they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>The project changes.  A new user reads some of the (sparse) documentation which
is now out of date.  Eventually they discover this and complain only to be met
with: &#34;Well it&#39;s a wiki, fix it yourself!&#34;</p>

<p>It is not the responsibility of the student to fix a broken lesson plan.  For
fuck&#39;s sake, <em>the entire point of having a teacher</em> is that they know what the
students need to learn and the students don&#39;t!</p>

<p>It&#39;s completely okay to ask your students for criticism so you can improve your
lesson plan.  Asking &#34;what parts did you find difficult?&#34; is fine.  It&#39;s another
thing entirely to ask them to <em>write your lesson plan for you</em>.</p>

<p>Seriously: fuck wikis.  They are bad and terrible.  Do not use them.  Take the
time and effort to write some real documentation instead.</p>

<h2 id="s17-the-reference"><a href="#s17-the-reference">The Reference</a></h2>

<p>The final type of documentation is &#34;the reference&#34;.  This section is for the
users who have traveled through the &#34;hairball&#34; and made it to the other side.
They&#39;re now your experts, and the reference should support them as they use your
project in their daily work.</p>

<p>This section should contain things that experienced users are likely to need,
such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#34;API documentation&#34; for every user-facing part of your project.</li>
<li>A full changelog, with particular attention to backwards-incompatible changes
  between versions.</li>
<li>Details about the internal implementation of the project.</li>
<li>Contribution policies (if your project accepts outside contributions).</li>
</ul>

<p>Tools like JavaDoc can produce something that looks like the first, but I share
the same opinion as Jacob Kaplan-Moss:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Auto-generated documentation is almost worthless. At best it&#39;s a slightly
improved version of simply browsing through the source, but most of the time
it&#39;s easier just to read the source than to navigate the bullshit that these
autodoc tools produce. About the only thing auto-generated documentation is
good for is filling printed pages when contracts dictate delivery of a certain
number of pages of documentation. I feel a particularly deep form of rage
every time I click on a &#34;documentation&#34; link and see auto-generated
documentation.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no substitute for documentation written, organized, and edited by
hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you can probably find a tool to read your project&#39;s source and shit out
some HTML files with the function names in them.  Maybe it will even include the
docstrings!</p>

<p>I would still urge you to write your API docs by hand.  It&#39;s going to be
a little more typing, but the results will be much better for a number of
reasons.</p>

<p>API docs and docstrings, while similar, serve different purposes.  Docstrings
have to provide what you need in the heat of coding in a REPL-friendly format.
API docs can afford the luxury of a bit more explanation, as well as links to
other things the user might want to know while browsing them on their couch.
API docs should also be Google-friendly.</p>

<p>A common objection here is that you&#39;re going to be retyping a lot of words.
Copy and paste mostly solves that problem, and learning to type makes the rest
a non-issue.</p>

<p>Some will say: &#34;But copy and pasting is evil!  You&#39;re duplicating effort!  How
will you keep the changes in the docstrings and the API docs in sync if they
change?&#34;</p>

<p>My opinion here is that if your public-facing API is changing often, you&#39;re
probably going to be making your users&#39; lives harder when they need to
constantly update their code to work with yours.  So the least you can do is
make <em>your</em> life a little harder to provide them with the best documentation
possible to help ease the pain.</p>

<p>Auto-generated documentation has no coherent voice.  It pulls in everything in
the code without regard for overall structure and vision.  You can <em>probably</em>
get away with it for the API docs in your &#34;reference&#34; documentation, or you
could take some pride in your work and write the best docs possible!</p>

<h2 id="s18-act-7-a-new-hope"><a href="#s18-act-7-a-new-hope">Act 7: &#34;A New Hope&#34;</a></h2>

<p>The final act of our play is set in a mall parking lot on a Sunday afternoon.
A single car is in the parking lot.  Inside is a family: a mother and father who
are teaching their son to drive.</p>

<p>They start by driving the car into the middle of the lot, away from any
obstacles.  The son gets into the driver&#39;s seat, and the parents explain briefly
what the main controls do.  They let him drive around the empty lot a bit to get
a feel for how the car works.</p>

<p>When it&#39;s time for him to park he shifts to park and takes off his seatbelt.
His mom reminds him of the control called a &#34;parking brake&#34;.  He realizes that
he should use this when parking.  A set of neurons is now linked in his brain
and he will remember to use the parking brake properly for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Over time the parents take their son driving many times, always being sure that
they&#39;re putting him into situations he can handle (but will still learn from).
He drives on a road, then learns to parallel park, then drives on a highway.</p>

<p>He has questions along the way.  Sometimes the parents are ready with an answer.
Sometimes the questions reveal something else missing deeper down in his
knowledge which the parents correct.</p>

<p>Over time he learns more and more.  He gets his license and begins driving on
his own.</p>

<p>When he gets a flat tire he reads the owner&#39;s manual and fixes it.</p>

<p>He watches the How It&#39;s Made episode about his car because he&#39;s curious how the
brakes which saved his life at a stop sign last week actually work.</p>

<p>His windshield wipers stop working one day.  He opens up the hood and figures
out the problem, fixing it himself.</p>

<p>One day he is hit by a drunk driver.  He walks away with only bruises.  He never
saw the countless crash tests the engineers performed to create the airbag
system, but they saved his life.</p>

<p>In the last scene we see the son many years later.  His hair is a bit gray now,
but otherwise he looks a lot like the teenager who forgot to use the parking
brake.</p>

<p>He&#39;s in a car with his teenage daughter, and he&#39;s teaching her how to drive.</p>
