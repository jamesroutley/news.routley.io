    <h1>The 1993 Murder She Wrote VR episode (2014)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Soon a hardboiled detective arrives to string together odd insults about tech culture in what he calls &#34;the Valley of the Klingons.&#34; &#34;I&#39;ve been working in this Valley for 17 years. Everyone once in a while one of you guys will flip out and attack somebody with a spinach salad or a floppy disc,&#34; gruffs the detective. He goes on to describe the murder as the sort of thing that would happen &#34;up on the Embarcadero in Frisco by the wise guys,&#34; a phrase no one from San Francisco has ever said.</p><p>After Kevin Sorbo is wrongly accused of the crime, Jessica decides that the answer lies behind that locked virtual door, so she enlists Alex the intern to help her. Although we&#39;re told Alex is currently on probation because he hacked into the New York Stock Exchange when he was 11 and has never met a password he can&#39;t crack, Alex can&#39;t seem to get past the encryption on the door.</p><p>Fortunately, Jessica Fletcher&#39;s homespun wisdom prevails. She muses that Dead Jerkboss was a genius, and that one of the characteristics of genius is the ability &#34;to reduce the complex to the simple, to the obvious. What about something basic, like OPEN DOOR?&#34; asks Jessica. &#34;That&#39;s it!&#34; exclaims the intern. &#34;We&#39;re in!&#34;</p><p>Jessica Fletcher laughs.</p><figure><p><span>Image: CBS</span></p></figure><p>Behind the door, a virtual version of the Dead Jerkboss is floating cross-legged in the clouds, unctuously announcing that they have found a door into his paranoid mind. He reveals that he&#39;s added hidden programs like this to everything he&#39;s ever created, and says that his true genius will be revealed if they can solve a riddle: &#34;What purpose can be served by the mind of man that cannot be better served by the binary brain?&#34;</p><p>It&#39;s less a riddle and more the literal theme of the entire episode spoken aloud, which is probably why they never solve it. Instead, Alex makes up a completely different riddle to trap the killer, who turns out to be one of the women in love with Kevin Sorbo. During her confession, she speechifies (in a perfectly on-theme way) about how her motivation for murder is inspired by the binary system. &#34;Zero or one,&#34; she says. &#34;I promised myself I&#39;d never live in the gray world between. It&#39;s either everything or nothing to me. I really had no choice.&#34;</p></div></div></div></div>
