    <h1>Writing a Text Editor</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m writing a text editor. Until I can think of a better name, it’s called <a href="https://github.com/davidbalbert/Watt">Watt</a>.</p><p><img src="https://dave.is/worklog/2023/05/24/writing-a-text-editor/watt.6c3872d78df69a47ab5377956d8a639e441fd473acec0d1847b76822d845ca2f.png" alt="A screenshot of Watt"/></p><p>Watt is for my own use. I want to have something that I can use as a daily driver, but that’s a tall order given that I’m used to having syntax highlighting, auto-complete, debugging, project-wide search, GitHub Copilot, etc. We’ll see how far I get.</p><p>One way I can simplify is by supporting extensions. Because Watt is just for me, if there’s a feature I need, I can build it in.</p><p>I use a Mac, so Watt is a Mac app. A GUI editor is more complicated than a CLI editor, but it’s what I like, and it’ll give me an excuse to learn more about text layout, rendering, and editing. I’m using Core Text, Apple’s low-level text layout and rendering API. There are higher level frameworks, most interestingly TextKit 2, but <a href="https://github.com/davidbalbert/TextKit-2-Playground">after spending time with it</a> last year, I think it’s a bit too buggy. Plus, using Core Text lets me learn more about text layout and rendering.</p><p>After ~3 weeks of work, Watt can render text into a scroll view at acceptable speed, and supports text selection and caret movement with the mouse. The next step is actually editing text.</p><p>I’m hoping to have text editing, including support for system-provided IMEs, done by tomorrow. That would normally be unrealistic, but I can scavange most of the code from last year’s TextKit 2 experiments.</p></div></div>
