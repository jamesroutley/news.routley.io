    <h1>Google restricts Android sideloading</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="5:1-5:530">Google has recently implemented new restrictions on sideloading Android apps, citing growing security concerns. In a pilot program launched in Singapore, the tech giant now blocks the installation of certain sideloaded apps—particularly those requesting sensitive permissions such as SMS access or accessibility services—if they are downloaded via web browsers, messaging apps, or file managers. The move, developed in partnership with Singapore’s Cyber Security Agency, is designed to prevent fraud and malware-enabled scams.</p><p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="7:1-7:398">In parallel, Google has rolled out its Play Integrity API, which allows developers to limit app functionality when sideloaded, effectively pushing users to install apps only through the Google Play Store. These policies reinforce Google’s control over Android’s ecosystem under the guise of security but have sparked renewed concern over digital autonomy, innovation suppression, and user rights.</p><p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="9:1-9:377">Critics argue that while these measures may reduce malicious activity, they also further consolidate Google’s monopolistic grip over app distribution—restricting user freedom, innovation, and competition. Sideloading, a longstanding pillar of Android’s openness, is now being marginalized, placing the Android platform closer to the walled-garden approach of Apple’s iOS.</p><h2>A Secure, Private Alternative: Purism’s PureOS, Secure Apps, and Librem Phones</h2><p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="11:1-12:398">In response to the increasing surveillance, manipulation, and corporate overreach embedded in mainstream mobile ecosystems, Purism offers a privacy-respecting solution. Powered by PureOS, a Debian-based Linux operating system, the Librem 5 and Liberty Phones enable full user autonomy, privacy, and data sovereignty—free from the predatory surveillance capitalism that fuels targeted advertising.</p><p><img src="https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/l5-front-apps-shadow-crop.png" alt="" width="700" height="438" srcset="https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/l5-front-apps-shadow-crop.png 700w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/l5-front-apps-shadow-crop-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"/></p><p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="14:1-14:318">PureOS supports secure, free and open source applications that do not rely on exploitative data mining, addictive algorithms, or behavioral manipulation. With no forced reliance on corporate app stores or intrusive APIs, Purism’s ecosystem restores control to the user while ensuring high levels of security and transparency.</p><p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="16:1-16:198">As Google further locks down Android and Big Tech doubles down on user exploitation, Purism stands as a beacon for those seeking ethical, secure, and open alternatives in the mobile computing space.</p></div></div></div></div>
