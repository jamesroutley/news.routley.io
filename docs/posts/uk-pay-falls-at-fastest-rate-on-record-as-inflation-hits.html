    <h1>UK pay falls at fastest rate on record as inflation hits</h1>

For the public sector the figure was 1.5%.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Pay including bonuses was down 0.9% when adjusted for inflation. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Unions are calling for wages to reflect the cost of living - but ministers have signalled the pay deal will not match price rises, warning this would push inflation even higher. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61891649">hit 9.1% in May</a>, the highest level in 40 years, and is expected to climb further by the autumn. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>James Reed, chairman of Reed, one of the UK&#39;s largest recruitment businesses, said the UK was seeing &#34;a two-speed workforce&#34;, with big pay offers being made to people with certain skills. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;So you might be seeing 25% plus pay offer increases to get people to move jobs. But then we&#39;re seeing other parts of the economy where pay hasn&#39;t moved much at all and that is concerning because more and more people will end up living in in-work poverty,&#34; he told the BBC&#39;s Today programme. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Virgin Money is the latest company to offer a one-off payment to help employees cope with the rising cost of living, with all staff on a salary of £50,000 or less to get a £1,000 lump sum in August. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Firms including Lloyds Bank have also offered similar payments. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Max Poynton says his doughnut firm is finding it difficult to recruit new staff</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>With job vacancies at near record highs, many sectors are struggling to recruit.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Max Poynton, operations director at Project D, a doughnut firm in Derby, said it was particularly hard to find experienced people. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I think a lot of people after the pandemic have gone and retrained, upskilled themselves and the same pool of people that was there before maybe isn&#39;t there anymore.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He knows staff are struggling, with some ride-sharing on their way into work to save money. Some have asked directly for a pay rise but with the business facing increased costs on everything from electricity to diesel to flour and icing, he says it is simply not an option.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I&#39;d love to be able to say yes but at the moment it&#39;s tough to offer any sort of pay rises, especially with the uncertainty of not knowing how much our costs are going to increase over the next six months.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Dan Bond is feeling the impact of rising prices</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Dan Bond, who works in the doughnut factory, said his last pay rise was in April when the minimum wage went up. Since then Dan, who drives to work, has seen a huge rise in the cost of filling up his tank. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, he is unsure whether he would ask his employer for a pay rise. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I know they&#39;re also experiencing hard times,&#34; he said. &#34;So do I put that pressure on as well?&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Business groups, including the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and Make UK, which represents manufacturers, said companies were struggling with higher wage demands from staff and that salary increases were beginning to hold back growth and investment. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Jane Gratton, from the BCC, told the Commons Business Committee small businesses were losing candidates to other employers offering higher pay and were worried about how they could compete with bigger firms. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The jobs market is still hot, with unemployment down and vacancies up near records. However, the ONS says it doesn&#39;t see evidence of the dreaded &#34;wage-price&#34; spiral that would entrench the current high rates of inflation. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Indeed the flip side of that is the biggest real squeeze on pay since these records were first collected two decades ago, and probably for significantly before that too.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Pay settlements are not &#34;inflationary&#34; as they are not exceeding inflation. Though there is some evidence in certain sectors and local settings, with worker shortages, of unionised workplaces securing double digit pay rises. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Other workplaces in construction and manufacturing see employers paying retention bonuses and cost of living lump sums. On average, while not inflationary, these settlements are high in cash terms.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is notable too that from March to May, average total pay including bonuses was up 7.2% in the private sector compared to the previous year, but up just 1.5% in the public sector. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Little wonder that those in the public sector say that some of the visible chaos seen in social care and the health system reflects low-paid public sector workers jumping ship to better paid jobs at the likes of supermarkets and Amazon. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This reduction in the social care workforce is crippling the sector enough to cause queues of ambulances unable to offload patients into hospitals unable to discharge their patients. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Much of this boils down to a singular factor, not even discussed in the current contest to run the country - significant shortages of labour.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Job vacancies continued to increase between April and June - up 6,900 compared to the previous quarter - although the rate is slowing. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The accommodation and food service sectors saw the biggest rise but this was offset by falls in other industries, including wholesale and retail trade and motor vehicle repairs.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>ONS head of labour market and household statistics, David Freeman, said demand for labour was &#34;clearly still very high&#34;, with unemployment falling again and another record low for redundancies. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>For March to May, the unemployment rate was estimated at 3.8%, a fall of 0.1 percentage points compared to the previous three-month period. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the figures &#34;underline how strong our jobs market continues to be&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But he added: &#34;I am acutely aware that rising prices are affecting how far people&#39;s hard-earned income goes, so we are providing help for households through cash grants and tax cuts.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, Labour&#39;s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said the Conservatives had &#34;failed to grow the economy, which has left people more exposed to inflation and the cost-of-living crisis&#34;. </p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
