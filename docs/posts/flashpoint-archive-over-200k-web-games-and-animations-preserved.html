Flashpoint Archive is a community effort to preserve games and animations from the web.</p><p>

Internet history and culture is important, and the web is evolving at such a rapid pace that what might be commonplace today could be obsolete tomorrow. This project is dedicated to preserving as many experiences from these platforms as possible, so that they aren&#39;t lost to time. Since December 2017, <a href="https://flashpointproject.github.io/flashpoint-database/statistics/">over 200,000 games and animations</a> have been preserved across more than a hundred browser plugins and web technologies.</p><p>

In addition to our preservation efforts, we also provide a highly flexible software package for reliable navigation and playback of preserved content. Among the software that powers Flashpoint is <a href="https://github.com/FlashpointProject/launcher">a fully-featured launcher</a> that acts as a frontend for the collection, <a href="https://github.com/FlashpointProject/FlashpointProxy">a proxy</a> that tricks games into thinking they&#39;re running on the live web, and <a href="https://github.com/FlashpointProject/FlashpointSecureTools">a sandbox</a> that allows for secure playback of plugin-enabled content - all of which are <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/source">open-source software</a>.</p>

The project <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/news#starting-date">was originally started</a> by BlueMaxima in an attempt to outrun the disappearance of webgames prior to the death of Flash. It has since evolved into a major undertaking involving hundreds of community contributors from around the world, encompassing both games and animations created for numerous internet plugins, frameworks, and standards.</p><p>

Flashpoint Archive operates as non-profit with the goal of furthering efforts in the preservation and accessibility of games, animations and other digital interactive experiences from the web.
