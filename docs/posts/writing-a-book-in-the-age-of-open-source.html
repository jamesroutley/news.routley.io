A book for aspiring </span><strong>Engineering Managers</strong><span>.</span></p><p>We quickly realized that writing was a much larger undertaking than we had anticipated. We also found ourselves overwhelmed by the numerous tools used in the industry.</p><p><span>As engineering managers, we knew one thing for certain: we wanted to </span><strong>optimize the process</strong><span> to make it as seamless as possible, allowing us to focus solely on the content.</span></p><p>Since committing to this colossal task, we&#39;ve conducted extensive research on the best tools and ways to improve our workflow. In our quest for efficiency, we&#39;ve discovered various methods that others use to achieve the same goal.</p><p><span>In this article, we will share our journey through various tools and explain how we chose </span><strong><a href="https://asciidoc.org/" rel="">Asciidoc</a></strong><span> as our &#34;</span><strong>chisel</strong><span>.&#34; We will also discuss the tools we&#39;ve developed to quickly and efficiently transform our content into a publishable asset.</span></p><p>As you can imagine, writing a book involves a significant amount of time spent with your chosen writing tools. Your desk, chair, keyboard, and software all contribute to how smooth (or challenging) your writing experience will be.</p><p>If you select a tool with several shortcomings—such as an inability to layout the book as desired—a significant portion of your time will be spent overcoming those challenges.</p><p>We did extensive preliminary research before we started where we talked to a couple of friends and family to ask about the tools they used to write their books in.</p><p><span>The most common answer was; </span><strong>Microsoft Word</strong></p><p><span>We knew up front that, whatever solution we picked, it should be </span><strong>accessible</strong><span>, </span><strong>easy-to-use</strong><span>, </span><strong>free</strong><span> and preferably </span><strong>open-source</strong><span>. That way, we would be able to have a repeatable and shareable setup. So </span><strong>Microsoft Word</strong><span> was a </span><strong>no-go</strong><span> for us.</span></p><p><strong>Google Docs</strong><span> was the next best choice. A fair bit of publishing companies as well as many authors do use it. It has the all the features which you would expect from a text editor and it’s </span><strong>free</strong><span> (if you exclude the fact that you’re data is being processed by a tech giant).</span></p><p><strong>Google Docs</strong><span> does not provide a great experience when it comes to writing but it definitely is accessible. It’s very easy to just pop open your browser and start typing.</span></p><p><span>As developers, quite often, we make use of </span><strong><a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/" rel="">Markdown</a></strong><span> to write our </span><strong>README</strong><span>s. This has given us a certain affinity with the language. We are engineers after all!</span></p><p><span>Therefore, after having experimented with </span><strong>Google Docs</strong><span>, we quickly decided that the workflow we have to manage our READMEs would work way better. We get to use our favorite text editor (</span><strong><a href="https://neovim.io/" rel="">Neovim</a></strong><span>, </span><strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="">Visual Studio Code</a></strong><span>, etc.) which makes it very easy-to-use and accessible. Most editors are free and quite few of them are also open source.</span></p><p><strong>Markdown</strong><span> does satisfy all the conditions we initially had in mind.</span></p><p>What we didn’t know at the time, however, is the fact that, to self-publish a book, it is not sufficient to just have the content ready. The book needs to be laid out. It has to adhere to common conventions about structure, such as from and back matters, book index, table of content. All of which, is very difficult to do in Markdown, since it’s not really built for such tasks.</p><p><span>Frustrated by </span><strong>Markdown</strong><span>&#39;s limitations, we found ourselves searching once again for a better solution—something that could offer the simplicity of Markdown while also providing the advanced features needed to prepare text for publication.</span></p><p><span>That&#39;s when we discovered </span><strong><a href="https://asciidoc.org/" rel="">Asciidoc</a></strong><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Asciidoc</strong><span> offers a rich feature set, encompassing everything you need to write a book. It includes not just the basics but also advanced tools like index generation and book covers. Additionally, </span><strong><a href="https://asciidoctor.org/" rel="">Asciidoctor</a></strong><span> enhances the experience with a robust suite of publishing tools.</span></p><p><span>All the way from custom type faces (allowing us to use our favourite typefaces from </span><strong><a href="https://connary.com/fonts.html" rel="">Connary Fagen</a></strong><span>) to being able to easily generate the front and back matter, including the covers as well as a index.</span></p><p><span>We also considered another option: </span><strong><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/\" rel="">LaTeX</a></strong><span>. While </span><strong>LaTeX</strong><span> would have certainly provided the flexibility we needed (and more), it would come at the expense of accessibility.</span></p><p><span>The memory of countless hours spent during university writing our first scientific paper with </span><strong>LaTeX</strong><span> quickly reminded us why it wasn&#39;t the right choice for this project. We decided to look elsewhere.</span></p><p>You&#39;ll spend most of your time typing, and before long, your backspace key might start wearing out. That&#39;s why we strongly recommend investing in the right setup. A proper desk that supports good posture will help you work more efficiently and reduce the risk of injury.</p><p><span>One of the most important components of the equation is your keyboard. </span><strong></strong></p><p><span> prefers to use a </span><strong><a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager" rel="">ZSA Voyager</a></strong><span>, which allows him to have an open posture thanks to the split form factor. It also allows him to spend less energy moving his fingers around the board, </span><strong>keeping his wrists happy</strong><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg" width="1456" height="658" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:658,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:1185744,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Where you sit or stand is as important (if not more) than your keyboard. </span><strong></strong></p><p><span> is more old school in the sense that he prefers to sit whilst writing.
