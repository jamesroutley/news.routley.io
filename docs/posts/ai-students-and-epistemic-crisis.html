Weird interaction with a student this week. They keep coming up with weird “facts” (“Greek is actually a combination of four other languages”) that left me baffled. I said let’s look this stuff up together, and they said <small><strong>OK</strong></small>, I’ll open a search bar, and they opened … Ch*tGPT. And I was like “this is not a search bar” and they were like “yes it is, you can search for anything in here”.
      </p><p>
The thing that made me feel crazy is like, every kid that’s using this as a browser is getting new <strong>bespoke</strong> false “facts”. This isn’t “a widespread misconception about <small><strong><em>X</em></strong></small> that stems from how it’s taught in schools.” Each individual kid is now hooked into a Nonsense Machine. 
      </p><p>
With the “widespread misconception about <small><strong><em>X</em></strong></small>” you can start at a baseline. Like, <small><strong>OK</strong></small>, in tenth grade we talk about <small><strong><em>X</em></strong></small> thing from history, and that leaves us with some misguided concepts about <small><strong><em>X</em></strong></small>, but we can correct that as students get broader understandings of the world. But with this, each child is getting <strong>unique</strong> wrong facts they are <strong>sure</strong> are correct … because they did what we told them to do! They “looked it up”! They got it from somewhere! It’s not a kid making up a belief on hearsay and assumption … it’s something they think they <strong>learned</strong>.   
       </p><p>
This kid was extremely combative with me, and I understood why. I was sitting in front of him telling him that the internet, a computer, technology, all these supposedly authoritative things … were wrong. And that I, one person, was right. He basically <em>couldn’t</em> believe me. He decided that I was simply a teacher who’d made a mistake. He could check it, after all! He could look it up! He could find the <strong>real</strong> facts. I obviously hadn’t done that, I was just an adult who’d decided I was smarter than him. Hence the defensiveness. Like I said: I understood.
      </p><p>
It was so fucking rough. I did my best, but I am one person trying to work against a campaign of misinformation so vast that it fucking terrifies me. This kid is being set up for a life lived entirely inside the hall of mirrors.

Transcribed from Twitter. The author took it down because of harassment, so I am not going to point to who they were. Not that I know anything about them anyway. So you have to make your own tricky call about whether and how it is relevant.
