      <blockquote>
        <p>The answer is both. Technology is making life more convenient and
        enjoyable, and many of us healthier, wealthier, and wiser. But it is
        also affecting work, family, and the economy in unpredictable ways,
        introducing new forms of tension and distraction, and posing new threats
        to the cohesion of our physical communities.
        </p><p>Despite the complicated and often contradictory implications of
        technology, the conventional wisdom is woefully simplistic. Pundits,
        politicians, and self-appointed visionaries do us a disservice when they
        try to reduce these complexities to breathless tales of either high-tech
        doom or cyber-elation. Such polarized thinking leads to dashed hopes and
        unnecessary anxiety, and prevents us from understanding our own culture.
        </p><p>Over the past few years, even as the debate over technology has been
        dominated by the louder voices at the extremes, a new, more balanced
        consensus has quietly taken shape. This document seeks to articulate
        some of the shared beliefs behind that consensus, which we have come to
        call technorealism.
        </p><p>Technorealism demands that we think critically about the role that
        tools and interfaces play in human evolution and everyday life. Integral
        to this perspective is our understanding that the current tide of
        technological transformation, while important and powerful, is actually
        a continuation of waves of change that have taken place throughout
        history. Looking, for example, at the history of the automobile,
        television, or the telephone -- not just the devices but the
        institutions they became -- we see profound benefits as well as
        substantial costs. Similarly, we anticipate mixed blessings from today&#39;s
        emerging technologies, and expect to forever be on guard for unexpected
        consequences -- which must be addressed by thoughtful design and
        appropriate use.
        </p><p>As technorealists, we seek to expand the fertile middle ground
        between techno-utopianism and neo-Luddism. We are technology
        &#34;critics&#34; in the same way, and for the same reasons, that
        others are food critics, art critics, or literary critics. We can be
        passionately optimistic about some technologies, skeptical and
        disdainful of others. Still, our goal is neither to champion nor dismiss
        technology, but rather to understand it and apply it in a manner more
        consistent with basic human values.
        </p><dl>
          <dt><b>1. Technologies are not neutral.</b><br/>
          </dt><dd>A great misconception of our time is the idea that technologies
            are completely free of bias -- that because they are inanimate
            artifacts, they don&#39;t promote certain kinds of behaviors over
            others. In truth, technologies come loaded with both intended and
            unintended social, political, and economic leanings. Every tool
            provides its users with a particular manner of seeing the world and
            specific ways of interacting with others. It is important for each
            of us to consider the biases of various technologies and to seek out
            those that reflect our values and aspirations.
            
          </dd><dt><b>2. The Internet is revolutionary, but not Utopian.</b><br/>
          </dt><dd>The Net is an extraordinary communications tool that provides a
            range of new opportunities for people, communities, businesses, and
            government. Yet as cyberspace becomes more populated, it
            increasingly resembles society at large, in all its complexity. For
            every empowering or enlightening aspect of the wired life, there
            will also be dimensions that are malicious, perverse, or rather
            ordinary.
            
          </dd><dt><b>3. Government has an important role to play on the electronic
            frontier.</b><br/>
          </dt><dd>Contrary to some claims, cyberspace is not formally a place or
            jurisdiction separate from Earth. While governments should respect
            the rules and customs that have arisen in cyberspace, and should not
            stifle this new world with inefficient regulation or censorship, it
            is foolish to say that the public has no sovereignty over what an
            errant citizen or fraudulent corporation does online. As the
            representative of the people and the guardian of democratic values,
            the state has the right and responsibility to help integrate
            cyberspace and conventional society.
            <p>Technology standards and privacy issues, for example, are too
            important to be entrusted to the marketplace alone. Competing
            software firms have little interest in preserving the open standards
            that are essential to a fully functioning interactive network.
            Markets encourage innovation, but they do not necessarily insure the
            public interest.
            </p>
          </dd><dt><b>4. Information is not knowledge.</b><br/>
          </dt><dd>All around us, information is moving faster and becoming cheaper
            to acquire, and the benefits are manifest. That said, the
            proliferation of data is also a serious challenge, requiring new
            measures of human discipline and skepticism. We must not confuse the
            thrill of acquiring or distributing information quickly with the
            more daunting task of converting it into knowledge and wisdom.
            Regardless of how advanced our computers become, we should never use
            them as a substitute for our own basic cognitive skills of
            awareness, perception, reasoning, and judgment.
            
          </dd><dt><b>5. Wiring the schools will not save them.</b><br/>
          </dt><dd>The problems with America&#39;s public schools -- disparate funding,
            social promotion, bloated class size, crumbling infrastructure, lack
            of standards -- have almost nothing to do with technology.
            Consequently, no amount of technology will lead to the educational
            revolution prophesied by President Clinton and others. The art of
            teaching cannot be replicated by computers, the Net, or by
            &#34;distance learning.&#34; These tools can, of course, augment
            an already high-quality educational experience. But to rely on them
            as any sort of panacea would be a costly mistake.
            
          </dd><dt><b>6. Information wants to be protected.</b><br/>
          </dt><dd>It&#39;s true that cyberspace and other recent developments are
            challenging our copyright laws and frameworks for protecting
            intellectual property. The answer, though, is not to scrap existing
            statutes and principles. Instead, we must update old laws and
            interpretations so that information receives roughly the same
            protection it did in the context of old media. The goal is the same:
            to give authors sufficient control over their work so that they have
            an incentive to create, while maintaining the right of the public to
            make fair use of that information. In neither context does
            information want &#34;to be free.&#34; Rather, it needs to be
            protected.
            
          </dd><dt><b>7. The public owns the airwaves; the public should benefit from
            their use.</b><br/>
          </dt><dd>The recent digital spectrum giveaway to broadcasters underscores
            the corrupt and inefficient misuse of public resources in the arena
            of technology. The citizenry should benefit and profit from the use
            of public frequencies, and should retain a portion of the spectrum
            for educational, cultural, and public access uses. We should demand
            more for private use of public property.
            
          </dd><dt><b>8. Understanding technology should be an essential component of
            global citizenship.</b><br/>
          </dt><dd>In a world driven by the flow of information, the interfaces --
            and the underlying code -- that make information visible are
            becoming enormously powerful social forces. Understanding their
            strengths and limitations, and even participating in the creation of
            better tools, should be an important part of being an involved
            citizen. These tools affect our lives as much as laws do, and we
            should subject them to a similar democratic scrutiny.</dd>
