    <h1>Enjoyed Jason Scott’s BBS documentary</h1>

		<p>Like many young programmers of my age, before I could use the Internet, there were BBSs.  I eventually ran one, though in my small town there were few callers.  </p>
<p>Some time back, I downloaded a copy of Jason Scott’s <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/">BBS Documentary</a>.  You might know Jason Scott from <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/">textfiles.com</a> and his work at the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>The documentary was released in 2005 and spans 8 episodes on 3 DVDs.  I’d watched parts of it before, but recently watched the whole series.</p>
<p>It’s really well done, and it’s not just about the technology.  Yes, that figures in, but it’s about the <i>people</i>.  At times, it was nostalgic to see people talking about things I clearly remembered.  Often, I saw long-forgotten pioneers interviewed.  And sometimes, such as with the ANSI art scene, I learned a lot about something I was aware of but never really got into back then.</p>
<p>BBSs and the ARPANet (predecessor to the Internet) grew up alongside each other.  One was funded by governments and universities; the other, by hobbyists working with inexpensive equipment, sometimes of their own design.</p>
<p>You can download the DVD images (with tons of extras) or watch just the episodes on Youtube following the links on the <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/order/">author’s website</a>.</p>
<p>The thing about BBSs is that they never actually died.  Now I’m looking forward to watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OwGSX2IiQ">Back to the BBS</a> documentary series about modern BBSs as well.</p>
