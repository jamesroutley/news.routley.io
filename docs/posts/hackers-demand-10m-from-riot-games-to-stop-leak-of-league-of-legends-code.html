We understand the significance of these artifacts and the impact their release to the public would have on your major titles, <em>Valorant </em>and <em>League of Legends</em>. In light of this, we are making a small request for an exchange of $10,000,000.”</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>As evidence, the hackers provided Riot Games with two large PDFs they said would prove they had access to Packman and the <em>League of Legends </em>source code. Motherboard also obtained these files; they appear to show directories related to the game’s code. If paid, the hackers promised to scrub the code from their servers and “provide insight into how the breach occurred and offer advice on preventing future breaches,” according to the ransom note.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In the message, the hackers included a link to a Telegram chat where they said Riot Games<em> </em>could speak with them. Motherboard joined this channel. Its members included usernames that matched those of names of Riot Games<em> </em>employees.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“We do not wish to harm your reputation or cause public disturbance. Our sole motivation is financial gain,” the ransom note said. The message has a deadline of 12 hours. “Failure to do so will result in the hack being made public and the extent of the breach being known to more individuals.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Riot Games<em> </em>first announced news of a <a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1616548651823935488" target="_blank"><span>compromise last week in a series of tweets</span></a>. The exact nature of the hack isn’t known, but Riot Games referred to it as a “social engineering attack”. It also said it had no indication that user data had been affected. On Tuesday, Riot Games <a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1617900234734198787" target="_blank"><span>said in a tweet</span></a><em> </em>it had confirmed hackers stole the source code for <em>League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, </em>and its “legacy” anticheat platform. <a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1617900236172857345" target="_blank"><span>Another tweet said</span></a> that on Tuesday “we received a ransom email. Needless to say, we won’t pay.” </p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“We also want to remind you that it would be a shame to see your company publicly exposed, especially when you take great pride in your security measures,” the hackers said in their ransom note. “It is alarming to know that you can be hacked within a matter of hours by an amateur-level hack.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In response to a request for comment from Motherboard, Riot declined to add anything further beyond the already published tweets. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The full note, minus the link to the Telegram chat, is printed below.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><em>Dear Riot Games,</em></p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><em>We have obtained your valuable data, including the precious anti-cheat source code and the entire game code for League of Legends and its tools, as well as Packman, your usermode anti-cheat.
