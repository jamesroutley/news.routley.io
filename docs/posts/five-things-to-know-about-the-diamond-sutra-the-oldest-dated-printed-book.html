        <p>No one is sure who Wang Jie was or why he had <em>The Diamond Sutra</em> printed. But we do know that on this day in 868 A.D.—or the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong in Jie’s time—he commissioned a block printer to create a 17-and-a-half-foot-long scroll of the sacred Buddhist text, including an inscription on the lower right hand side reading, “Reverently made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents.” Today, that scroll is <a href="http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-diamond-sutra#sthash.Hl6gs0Bz.dpuf">housed at the British Library</a> and is acknowledged as the oldest dated printed book in existence.</p>

<p>Chances are you know a little something about the <a href="http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/gutenbergbible/">Gutenberg Bible</a>, the first book made with moveable type, which came along almost 600 years later. Bibliophiles might also have a working knowledge of other famous manuscripts like the <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/library/research-collections/book-of-kells.php">Book of Kells</a>, <a href="http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/">The Domesday Book</a>, and <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/shakespeares-first-folio-goes-tour-us-180957736">Shakespeare’s First Folio</a>. Well, <em>The Diamond Sutra </em>should be in that pantheon of revered books, as well. Here’s why:</p>

<p><strong>Origins</strong></p>

<p>In 1907, British-Hungarian archaeologist Marc Aurel Stein was on an expedition mapping the ancient Silk Road when he heard about the secret library. He bribed the abbot of the monastic group in charge of the cave and <a href="http://www.monkeytree.org/silkroad/stein.html">smuggled away thousands of documents</a>, including <em>The Diamond Sutra</em>. The <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/">International Dunhuang Project</a> is now digitizing those documents and 100,000 others found on the eastern Silk Road.</p>

<p><strong>Content</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why is it Diamond?</strong></p>

<p>A full translation of the document&#39;s title is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Diamond-That-Cuts-Through-Illusion/dp/1935209442"><em>The Diamond That Cuts Through Illusion</em></a>. As <a href="http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/podsusanwhitfield.html">Susan Whitfield, director of the Dunhuang Project explains</a>, the sutra helps cut through our perceptions of the world and its illusion. &#34;[W]e just think we exist as individuals but we don’t, in fact, we’re in a state of complete non-duality: there are no individuals, no sentient beings,” Whitfield writes. </p>

<p><strong>Why did Wang Jie commission it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is one quote I should know from <em>The Diamond Sutra?</em></strong></p>

<p>It’s difficult to translate the sutra word for word and still catch its meaning. But this passage about life, which Bill Porter, who goes by the alias &#34;<a href="https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/authors/bill-porter/#:~:text=Bill%20Porter%20assumes%20the%20pen,graduate%20school%20at%20Columbia%20University.">Red Pine</a>,&#34; adapted to English, is one of the most popular:</p>
