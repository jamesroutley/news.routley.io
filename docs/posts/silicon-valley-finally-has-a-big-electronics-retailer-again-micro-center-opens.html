    <h1>Silicon Valley finally has a big electronics retailer again: Micro Center opens</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p dir="ltr">After years of waiting, the ribbon has been cut and Micro Center Silicon Valley is officially open. </p>
<p dir="ltr">On a sunny Friday morning in Santa Clara, with hundreds of fans queued in a line wrapping down the block and around the corner, we welcomed the Silicon Valley community to our newest store, at <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/site/stores/santa-clara.aspx">5201 Stevens Creek Blvd</a>. </p>
<p dir="ltr">If you&#39;re a DIY PC builder, a serious gamer, a creator, a maker, or just someone who gets excited over the latest CPUs, GPUs, and 3D printers, then you already know what Micro Center is about</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Bay Area sets a high bar for all things tech, and here you&#39;ll find aisles stacked high with components, knowledgeable staff who actually know what they&#39;re talking about, and a hands-on experience you just can&#39;t replicate online. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The grand opening celebration also features special promotions, including 20% off Windows desktops and laptops and 20% off monitors. Additionally, the store has over 4,000 graphics cards in stock, including exclusive models, that will available for our grand opening event.
