      <p>In case you’ve been avoiding the news or don’t live in the Global
North: there is a war going on right now. A war started by Russia by
invading Ukraine, a sovereign nation. There are a multitude of political
and historical reasons for why this is happening, but aggression remains
just that.</p>
<p>Since the war started, my family and I have been involved in helping
Ukrainians from Berlin, and I wanted to document what I know about and
my experiences, in the hopes that it can do a little good and help a few
people get involved.</p>
<p>Because I do not know how to write gracefully about political and
divisive topics, the tone of this blog post might be different from what
you know if you’re a long-time reader.</p>
<p>I split this post in two parts: donating (financial, material, time),
and hosting.</p>
<h2 id="donating">Donating</h2>
<p>None of these are exhaustive. This is meant as a quick overview of
the things we did or know about.</p>
<h3 id="monetary">Monetary</h3>
<p>Monetary help is always needed. If you can afford to spend a few
bucks, then I suggest you go down that route first: it’s immediate and
it’s easy.</p>
<p>Depending on your sensibilities, you can donate to unpolitical or
political charities. If it fits your sensibilities, you can even donate
to the Ukrainian military directly. I haven’t done that. I personally
donated to the <a href="https://abcdd.org/en/2022/03/02/donation-page-for-solidarity-with-anarchist-and-anti-authoritarian-activist-from-ukraine/">Anarchist
Black Cross Dresden</a>. As the name suggests, this is a political
organization and might not fit your sensibilities, in which case you’ll
have to do your own research.</p>
<h3 id="material">Material</h3>
<p>Material donations are also appreciated. We’ve donated clothes
(though most places do not accept regular clothes anymore), a laptop,
and a stroller.</p>
<p><a href="https://instytutpolski.pl/berlin/2022/02/28/sammlung-von-sachspenden-fur-gefluchtete-aus-der-ukraine-hilfefurdieukraine-pomagamukrainie/">The
Polish Institute Berlin</a> is one of a few places that accept every-day
items (some places are looking for items such as combat tourniquets or
bullet-proof vests, which I don’t suppose most of us have lying around).
Scroll down for the English version.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.holzmarkt.com/">Holzmarkt in Berlin</a> is
housing Ukrainian refugees, and they’re looking both for material
donations and people who know Ukrainian to help coordinate. This is
where our stroller and laptop went, and the person we are currently
hosting (see below) is helping out there.</p>
<h3 id="time">Time</h3>
<p>At the moment, I am working full-time while my wife is on maternity
leave. As such, I’ve been trying to take care of child-care in my
off-time to help my wife free up time to help arrivals at Hauptbahnhof
and other places. When we were most active, these were organized
primarily through WhatsApp and Telegram groups, though I think it
“professionalized” over time. <a href="https://linktr.ee/michelledts">One potential starting point if
you’re interested could be here</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve also been helping the people we’re hosting figure out how and
where to get vaccinated, showed them the city, and are currently helping
them get their paperwork in order so that they can start a “new life”
here if they decide to do so. All of this is draining, because
bureaucracy is hard, but it’s also deeply rewarding.</p>
<p>Finally, when you are hosting someone, expect to spend some time just
being there, listening to stories and concerns, and maybe see a
troubling image—or many of them—on a phone screen.</p>
<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>
<p>The first time my wife went to the train station to help out she came
back with four kind Moroccan students who had just fled and were lucky
enough to come through before the great racial segregation at the
borders started. We hadn’t planned on hosting that many people, but
everyone just took in mothers and children, and the four of them were
“left over”—this might be telling already.</p>
<p>Inviting four strange men into your home might seem scary at first,
but I’d like you to consider that they’re refugees, fleeing from war,
trying to figure out where to go. They have better things to do than a
random burglary.</p>
<p>The four of them stayed with us for two nights while we helped them
figure out where they wanted to go next, and who would receive them
there. This meant joining a local Telegram group in another city and
writing a message explaining their situation and asking for
housing—really no skin off our backs.</p>
<p>As of now, we are hosting a Ukrainian who wants to stay in Berlin,
and we’ve helped him get his booster vaccination (easy, go to any place
that does COVID vaccinations) and tried to give him a safe space to
arrive. Now he’s helping out himself. We don’t know how long he will
stay with us—we’re happy to have him with us, and our baby has already
decided that he’s his new best friend.</p>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>When the war in Ukraine started I primarily felt two things: grief
and inertia. This war is clearly not about me, and yet I felt compelled
to do something. To come to grips with this, I decided to help where I
was, and however I could.</p>
<p>For some of us, getting active like this is giving energy. For some
of us, it’s draining energy. Only give however much you have to give,
and don’t burn yourself out. But please, at least get started.</p>
<p>UPDATE: an important thing to mention is that my wife is way more
active than I am, and for most of the organizing, planning, and
executing the credit goes to her. It’s a deeply troubling situation when
the woman in the relationship takes care of most of the emotional and
care work, and I want to at least acknowledge that. I hope that I
succeed in at least pulling my weight.</p>
