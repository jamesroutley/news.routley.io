		      came to operator command level, entered admin mode,

		    <strong>Multics</strong> (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service)
		    was a mainframe time-sharing operating system begun in 1965 and used until 2000. 
		    Multics began as a research project and was an important influence on operating system development. 
		    The system became a commercial product sold by Honeywell to education, government, and industry. 
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    Multics was a prototype of a <a href="https://probablydance.com/2025/08/04/installing-a-mini-split-ac-in-a-brooklyn-apartment/mgc.html#computerutility" title="glossary: A computer, its software, and staff set up to...">Computer Utility</a>, providing secure computing to remote users at their terminals.
		    Multicians still miss the elegant, consistent, and powerful programming environment;
		    some Multics features are only now being added to contemporary systems.
