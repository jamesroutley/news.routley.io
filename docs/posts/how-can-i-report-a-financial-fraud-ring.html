    <h1>Ask HN: How can I report a financial fraud ring?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>A scammer contacted me on reddit to invite me to join his carding ring. They are using people&#39;s stolen identities to open bank accounts in their name, making fraudulent Amazon purchases with that account, and then selling the Amazon goods on ebay before finally laundering the profits through crypto.</p><p>I think the scammer made an error though, which is that he posted his coinbase account url directly in the invitation email.</p><p>The scam is structured so that all of the &#34;students&#34; send crypto payments directly to the ringleader; seems fairly simple to find the ringleader&#39;s account and then find the rest of the ring by tracing who is sending money to that account.</p><p>Here&#39;s the intro video I was sent where you can see the coinbase account (I copied the video and made a youtube backup):</p><p>https://vimeo.com/user188604890?embedded=true&amp;source=owner_name&amp;owner=188604890</p><p>https://youtu.be/eZGqHx8NS1o</p><p>Here&#39;s also the original text message I was sent:</p><p>༺◍━═━═━◓━═━═━◍༻</p><p>The only time you&#39;ll be invited. Read thoroughly.</p><p>Online Carding is when you buy compromised credit card details for $10-$20 via autoshops (jstash, feshop, yalelodge, etc) and use it to place big orders on online sites like Amazon, BestBuy, etc.</p><p>Assuming you could navigate Amazon&#39;s fraud detection, you could place an $800 order using the card. What I do is simple, I provide a mentorship where I will (1-on-1) walk you through making at least $3,500 per week through routinely carding Amazon, start to finish, in exchange for less than 1/10th of the profit you make long-term. This is 100% digital.</p><p>ALL students make over $3,500 per week from this, some nearing up to $6,000.
What I&#39;m about to show you is heavily substantiated with mountains of indisputable proof.</p><p>◉⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⊰ LEGIT ⊱⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯◉
Over 1,100+ positive rep on Empire from when I used to sell guides. (omnision | 2,900+ total rep, 4.93  ). Teaching carding since 2017.</p><p>TWO vouching channels where students routinely post proof of their success.</p><p>Students follow thorough guidelines when vouching, providing objective proof that their success is REAL and CURRENT.</p><p>Students join via Selly, which means ALL students can rate me &amp; leave feedback, and you can see it prior to joining.</p><p>◉⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⊰ TIME ⊱⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯◉
MENTORSHIP: 5 days, 1 hour sessions per day.</p><p>AFTER TAUGHT: ~20 min to card an order. 1-4 orders per day. (20m- 1h20m).</p><p>◉⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⊰ SAFE ⊱⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯◉
The government convicts 1/13,698 online carders. 1/48 shoplifters for comparison. ANY associated risks will be methodically eliminated through proper digital OPSEC procedure. More detail in our Q&amp;A channel w/ sources provided.</p><p>༺◍━═━═━◒━═━═━◍༻</p><p>STATUS (11/12/2022): 4 out of 25 slots remaining.</p></div></td></div></div>
