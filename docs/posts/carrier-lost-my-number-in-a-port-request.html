    <h1>Ask HN: Carrier “lost” my number in a port request</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I tried switching from T-Mobile to US Mobile after parking it on a VoIP service for a year (was abroad). They botched the port request completely. Ended up gaslighted by both companies, both claimed they &#34;don&#39;t have the number&#34;.</p><p>Need my number for 2FA—literally can&#39;t move forward with a background check for my new job, can&#39;t send money to my family with my bank, etc. I&#39;m sure I could theoretically get a new number but it seems the admin cost of this would possibly be in the hundreds of hours.</p><p>Do I have any recourse?</p></div></div></div>
