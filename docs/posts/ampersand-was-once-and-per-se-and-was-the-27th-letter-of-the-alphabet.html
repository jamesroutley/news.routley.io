    <h1>Ampersand was once “and per se and” &amp; was the 27th letter of the alphabet</h1>

<p><span>is called
an ampersand. It’s derived from a handwritten combination of the letters E and T, as in <i>et</i>, <a href="http://www.shadycharacters.co.uk/2011/06/the-ampersand-part-1-of-2/" target="_blank">the Latin word for “and”</a>. <span>You might have already known that. But whether you did or you didn’t, the fact is that the swirly thing you
usually call an “and sign” </span><span>actually has a name. And if it has a name, then there’s
a </span><i>reason</i><span> for it having that name. Which is where we come in.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Up
until as recently as the mid 1900s, it was standard practice when reciting
the alphabet to use <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/per_se#Latin" target="_blank">the Latin phrase <i>per se</i></a> (literally “by itself”) to differentiate between individual
letters of the alphabet—like A, I, and O—and single-character homographic words—like
<i>a</i>, <i>I</i> and <i>O</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>So the letter A would be read as “A <i>per se </i>A”,
to ensure it was distinguished from the indefinite article <i>a</i>. The letter I, similarly, would be “I <i>per se </i>I” to differentiate it from the pronoun <i>I</i>. And the letter O would be “O <i>per se </i>O” to differentiate it from the interjection
<i>O!</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div>
<p><span>But
because it was just another character representing just another unit of the English language, the symbol &amp; was also once considered a letter
of the alphabet, and was included after Z in twenty-seventh place. And so to
differentiate &amp; from the conjunction <i>and</i>,
the alphabet once ended with a final “X, Y, Z, and &amp; <i>per se</i> &amp;”. <o:p></o:p></span></p></div>
