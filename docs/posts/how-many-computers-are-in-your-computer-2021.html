            <p>Why are there so many places for backdoors and weird machines in your “computer”? Because your computer is in fact scores or hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of computer chips, many of which host <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Turing-complete#security-implications" id="gwern-turing-complete-security-implications">weird machines</a> and are explicitly or implicitly capable of Turing-complete computations (many more powerful than desktops of bygone eras), working together to create the illusion of a single computer. Backdoors, bugs, weird machines, and security do not care about what you think—only where resources can be found and orchestrated into a computation.</p>

        <p>If ‘the network is now the computer’, it is equally true that ‘the computer is now <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/fgiesen.wordpress.com/81a7f5e44ec4e9a55df9bb2dbd5535302ba06acb.html" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2014/03/23/networks-all-the-way-down/" title="Networks all the way down (Original URL: https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2014/03/23/networks-all-the-way-down/ )">a network</a> (of computers)’. While perhaps the earliest computers like the Altair PC really did have just one ‘computer’ in them, one place where all Turing-complete tasks had to pass through, that era is long over, and a ‘computer’ is composed of countless components, many of which previously could have been an useful computer. The phrase “computer” is one of convenience, rather than a hard-and-fast distinction. What is important are the inputs and outputs: how capable is the system as a whole and what resources does it require and how can the components be reprogrammed?</p>

Any of these pieces of hardware could support multiple weird machines on many different levels of computation depending on their internal dynamics &amp; connectivity. The system can be seen on many levels, each equally invalid but useful for different purposes.

          <p>Here is an example of the ill-defined nature of the question: on your desk or in your pocket, how many computers do you currently have? How many computers are in your “computer”? Did you think just one? Let’s take a closer look—it’s computers all the way down. You might think you have just the one large CPU occupying pride of place on your motherboard, and perhaps the GPU too, but the computational power available goes far beyond just the CPU/​GPU, for a variety of reasons: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">mass-produced</a> transistors and processor cores are so cheap now that it often makes sense to use a separate core for realtime or higher performance, for security guarantees, to avoid having to burden the main OS with a task, for compatibility with an older architecture or existing software package, because a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">DSP</a> or core can be programmed faster than a more specialized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">ASIC</a> can be created, or because it was the quickest possible solution to slap down a small CPU and they couldn’t be bothered to shave some pennies<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>… (Halvar Flake dubs this phenomenon <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/rule11.tech/dbe98431625691329b546c08d12fe486a79af75f.pdf" id="flake-2018" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="http://rule11.tech/papers/2018-complexitysecuritysec-dullien.pdf" title="Security, Moore’s law, and the anomaly of cheap complexity (Original URL: http://rule11.tech/papers/2018-complexitysecuritysec-dullien.pdf )">“cheap complexity”</a>⁠.)

Further, many of these components can be used as computational elements even if they were not intended to be or try to hide that functionality. (For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Commodore 64’s</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_1541" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">floppy drive’s</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">CPU</a> running Commodore DOS was used as a source of spare compute power &amp; for defeating copy-protection schemes, because it was as powerful; one can offload to the ‘co-processor’ tasks like computing fractals, 3D math routines for animating demos, computer chess…)</p>

          <p>So a desktop or smartphone can reasonably be expected to have anywhere from 15 to several thousand “computers” (in the sense of a Turing-complete device which can be programmed in an usefully general fashion with little or no code running on the ‘official’ computer); which is computationally powerful enough to run many programs from throughout computing history; and which can be exploited by an adversary for surveillance, exfiltration, or attacks against the rest of the system.</p>
          <p>None of this is unusual historically, as even the earliest mainframes tended to be multiple computers, with the main computer doing batch processing while additional smaller computers took care of high-speed I/​O operations that would otherwise choke the main computers with interrupts.</p>
          <p>In practice, aside from the computer security community (as all these computers are insecure and thus useful attack routes), users don’t care that our computers, under the hood, are insanely complex and more accurately seen as a motley menagerie of hundreds of computers awkwardly yoked together; as long as it is working correctly, he perceives &amp; uses it as a single powerful computer.</p>
          <p>Until it stops working as expected.</p>
