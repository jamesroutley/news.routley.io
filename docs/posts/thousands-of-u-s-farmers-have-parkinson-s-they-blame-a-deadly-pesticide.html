    <h1>Thousands of U.S. farmers have Parkinson&#39;s. They blame a deadly pesticide</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="Z2M3ANX3OVHE7AJEJ2RHC4MRFM">Paul Friday remembers when his hand started flopping in the cold weather – the first sign nerve cells in his brain were dying.</p><p id="W2ZE2LIMJFE3ZJCXFF2QQIPBB4">He was eventually diagnosed with Parkinson’s, a brain disease that gets worse over time. His limbs got stiffer. He struggled to walk. He couldn’t keep living on his family farm. Shortly afterward, Friday came to believe that decades of spraying a pesticide called paraquat at his peach orchard in southwestern Michigan may be the culprit.</p><p id="P2JCXDFYURB55A2RQKEMJTSQZA">“It explained to me why I have Parkinson’s disease,” said Friday, who is now 83, and makes that claim in a pending lawsuit.</p><p id="VRUL3AZYOJBDFJBELVLBCNTMRQ">The pesticide, a weed killer, is extremely toxic.</p><p id="7YB674MWOVDNZKFFDB45BXCDII">With evidence of its harms stacking up, it’s already been banned in dozens of countries all over the world, including the United Kingdom and China, where it’s made. Yet last year, its manufacturer Syngenta, a subsidiary of a company owned by the Chinese government, continued selling paraquat in the United States and other nations that haven’t banned it. </p><p id="F7Y5O3TXPBBWDJKRETXF7URHF4">Health statistics are limited. Critics point to research linking paraquat exposure to Parkinson’s, while the manufacturer pushes back, saying none of it is peer-reviewed. But the lawsuits are mounting across the United States, as farmers confront Parkinson’s after a lifetime of use, and much of the globe is turning away from paraquat. </p><p id="JEDZRWYMBJAN3EAKC47BL4PVHA">It has many critics wrestling with the question: What will it take to ban paraquat in the United States? </p><p id="6T4XUVSTU5CNLCWQ4TQKRM4MFE">“What we’ve seen over the course of decades is a systemic failure to protect farmworkers and the agricultural community from pesticides,” said Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, an environmental law organization that advocates against paraquat.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/EJ3RBQFGF5G2LFFPFCFY6EXAFU.jpg?auth=ae690ec29f681597aa2e12b61d0031ce425e5438bbee41bcb55e54c6b8a086a4" srcset="https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/EJ3RBQFGF5G2LFFPFCFY6EXAFU.jpg?auth=ae690ec29f681597aa2e12b61d0031ce425e5438bbee41bcb55e54c6b8a086a4 300w, https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/EJ3RBQFGF5G2LFFPFCFY6EXAFU.jpg?auth=ae690ec29f681597aa2e12b61d0031ce425e5438bbee41bcb55e54c6b8a086a4 768w, https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/EJ3RBQFGF5G2LFFPFCFY6EXAFU.jpg?auth=ae690ec29f681597aa2e12b61d0031ce425e5438bbee41bcb55e54c6b8a086a4 1024w"/></p><p>Paul Friday was a lifelong peach farmer in Coloma, Michigan until he developed Parkinson&#39;s Disease in 2017.<span> <!-- -->Photo provided by Luiba Friday</span></p></div></div><h2>Thousands of lawsuits pile up</h2><p id="XOCKWDYSSVCTROU6MSMOVHZL64">It was hard for Ruth Anne Krause to watch her husband of 58 years struggle to move his hands.

His wife says he often donned a mask and yellow rubber boots to spray paraquat on the fields.</p><p id="SHSPPGDLPFEG7CEL22ZN7D6MAA">Krause, who had no family history of neurological disease as is typical, died in 2024.</p><p id="FZWEWOJ6LRGYZACOHVIQMH2NOU">“I want people to know what happened,” said Ruth Anne Krause, who is worried that paraquat is still being sold to American farmers. </p><p id="MWTSGRKFLBDYLCFSFHAUBOLL24">Krause is one of thousands of people who have sued Syngenta, a manufacturer, and Chevron USA, a seller, over paraquat exposure. They’re alleging the chemical companies failed to warn of the dangers of paraquat despite knowing it could damage human nerve cells and studies showing it’s linked to Parkinson’s disease. </p><div><div><p><img src="https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/2OM2ONNHWFA2ZB4UUQGMCDSZHQ.JPG?auth=0c437d8616589bd5f4c32418c1d30cc73a8982a82bbbdb912072db5a50483562" srcset="https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/2OM2ONNHWFA2ZB4UUQGMCDSZHQ.JPG?auth=0c437d8616589bd5f4c32418c1d30cc73a8982a82bbbdb912072db5a50483562 300w, https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/2OM2ONNHWFA2ZB4UUQGMCDSZHQ.JPG?auth=0c437d8616589bd5f4c32418c1d30cc73a8982a82bbbdb912072db5a50483562 768w, https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/2OM2ONNHWFA2ZB4UUQGMCDSZHQ.JPG?auth=0c437d8616589bd5f4c32418c1d30cc73a8982a82bbbdb912072db5a50483562 1024w"/></p><p>Between 11 million and 17 million pounds of paraquat are sprayed annually on American farms, according to the latest data from the U.S. Geological Survey.

Another 1,300 cases have been brought in Pennsylvania, 450 in California and more are scattered throughout state courts.</p><p id="T7FPVRRWXJDJ5AMXR6WPCVVYHM">“I do think it’s important to be clear that number is probably not even close to representative of how many people have been impacted by this,” said Christian Simmons, a legal expert for Drugwatch. </p><p id="FC6EJZHEKJDCHFCSMIPDAH6DWU">Syngenta <a href="https://www.syngenta.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Financial%20Report%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="">told its shareholders in March</a> that an additional 1,600 cases have been voluntarily dismissed or resolved.

The pesticide, originally developed by Syngenta and sold by Chevron, rips tissue apart, destroying plants on a molecular level within hours.</p><p id="TXJFF3ZCVBF6ZJZUZAF4QAEORU">“It’s used because it’s effective at what it does. It’s highly toxic. It’s very good at killing things,” said Geoff Horsfield, policy director at the Environmental Working Group. “And unfortunately, when a pesticide like this is so effective that also means there’s usually human health impacts as well.”</p><div><p><a href="https://www.al.com/news/2025/12/alabama-farmer-has-parkinsons-hes-among-thousands-who-say-weed-killer-is-to-blame.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-enhanced="true" data-thumbnail="true"><img src="https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/WATC7KQET5ELJBK6LFPHF4HHLQ.JPG?auth=594d4554dc475fb5d744ed072b7e431c78e841977876c79b2a9bc32820a8f25d&amp;width=500&amp;smart=true&amp;quality=90" alt="Opp farmer Mac Barlow-featured"/></a></p></div><p id="D3K2QBNFGRHMDK3UD4KKJJ7XEY">By the 1970s, it became a tool in the war on drugs, sprayed to kill Mexican marijuana plants.

And despite the alleged known risks, its use is increasing, according to the most current federal data, more than doubling from 2012 to 2018. </p><p id="CMG6JIUF7JBANGFWO4AH3BQSBA">The USGS says on its website new pesticide use data will be released in 2025. It hasn’t been published yet. </p><p id="Y7QVSR7FRZBGHP5236Q63IKFIQ">Because paraquat kills any growth it touches, it’s typically used to clear a field before any crops are planted. <a href="https://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/paraquat.html" target="_blank" rel="">Low levels of paraquat residue</a> can linger on food crops, but the foremost threat is direct exposure. </p><p id="MWQFYNAYI5HFBOUMIHN37OWRHM">Pesticides are among the most common means of suicide worldwide, <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/preventing-suicide-by-phasing-out-highly-hazardous-pesticides" target="_blank" rel="">according to the World Health Organization</a>, and paraquat is frequently <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3243009/" target="_blank" rel="">used because of its lethality.</a> After some nations, like South Korea and Sri Lanka, banned it, they saw a significant drop in suicides, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-abstract/45/2/470/2572538?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="">research shows</a>.</p><p id="X6TDAXHM3FEGJPMUFVJLWTAJAY">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency already restricts paraquat, labeling it as “registered use,” with a skull and crossbones, meaning it can only be used by people who have a license. Because of its toxicity, the federal government requires it to have blue dye, a sharp smell and a vomiting agent, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chemical-emergencies/chemical-fact-sheets/paraquat.html" target="_blank" rel="">U.S. Centers for Disease Control, CDC</a>. Sprayers are also told to wear protective gear. </p><p id="GRTLJOHETZHIDJAZMYX63EXFD4">Despite those safety measures, U.S. poison centers have gotten hundreds of paraquat-related calls in the past decade, their annual reports show.</p><p id="Z6S3OILK2FATJETFWTXM5CLP7A">Swallowing is the most likely way to be poisoned by paraquat, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chemical-emergencies/chemical-fact-sheets/paraquat.html" target="_blank" rel="">according to the CDC</a>, but skin exposure can also be deadly. In fact, if it spills on someone, health officials say they should wash it off immediately and quickly cut off their clothes. That way they don’t risk spreading more deadly pesticide on their body as they pull their shirt over their head. </p><p id="PW3QJZ22SVDLRHGVV4Q4RLAFIE">In one 2023 case <a href="https://poisoncenters.org/annual-reports" target="_blank" rel="">documented by America’s Poison Centers</a>, a 50-year-old man accidentally sipped blue liquid from a Gatorade bottle that turned out to be paraquat.

He died within three days.</p><p id="TUH5ANIKXVE3HDZE2RKBJLS4VI">In another poison center report, a 65-year-old man spilled paraquat on his clothes and kept working. Ten days later, he went to the emergency room with second-degree burns on his stomach.

One by one, more countries followed suit. In 2007, the European Union <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/eu-court-reimposes-ban-on-paraquat-weedkiller-idUSL11666800/" target="_blank" rel="">approved a blanket ban</a> for all 27 member countries, according to media reports. </p><p id="DF5YBLFXR5H7PGK2G4RJXJV4KQ">Yet Syngenta is still allowed to manufacture paraquat in countries that have banned its use.

SinoChem posted <a href="https://fortune.com/company/sinochem-holdings/" target="_blank" rel="">$3.4 billion</a> in profits last year, but it’s unclear how much came from paraquat sales because the company doesn’t make earnings reports public. <a href="https://www.syngenta.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Financial%20Report%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="">Syngenta reported</a> $803 million in sales of its “non-selective herbicides,” the class that includes paraquat-containing Gramoxone, according to its 2024 financial report. </p><p id="HHGMRJMUP5GU3JY3G6FGHXB7DQ">While Chinese companies supply paraquat to American farmers, the report points out China is also a big purchaser of crops, like soybeans, that are grown with help from the pesticide.</p><p id="RSBBWQ5DLJDOXLNWJQ2SRW3PVE">“In these two ways, China economically benefits from the application of paraquat in the U.S., where it outsources many of its associated health hazards,” the report said.</p><p id="764KX4XJJ5GRDMKSZTE6QVPBVU">Paraquat, now prohibited in more than 70 countries, <a href="https://www.ewg.org/areas-focus/toxic-chemicals/paraquat" target="_blank" rel="">according to the Environmental Working Group</a>, was reauthorized by the EPA in 2021 when it passed a regularly scheduled 15-year review — a move challenged by critics. </p><p id="2Q3265P3B5G75MRS6LQ7VPOELU">“EPA has the same information that those countries have,” said Kalmuss-Katz, the attorney with EarthJustice. “EPA has just reached a fundamentally different, and what we believe is a legally and scientifically unsupported position, which is: massive amounts of paraquat can continue to be sprayed without unreasonable risk.”</p><p id="43QS4VGRE5EHPODA5PWMI53J2Y">The federal agency determined paraquat remains “an effective, inexpensive, versatile, and widely used method of weed control,” and any risks to workers are “outweighed by the benefits” of farms using the weed killer.</p><p id="HJPUMSSU5NBHPDMFC4D5BIEY5M">“It is one of the mostly highly regulated pesticides available in the United States,” the agency said in a statement.</p><p id="34QDSAGPFFGZLJAGBAEU6DG5JA">This decision allowed it to be used with “new stronger safety measures to reduce exposure,” like requiring buffer zones where pesticides can’t be sprayed. </p><p id="VGLT7MCGHFD2ZEWWSWWRBROO6A">For plants like cotton, alfalfa, soybeans and peanuts, the EPA wrote in its decision “growers may need to switch to alternative (weed-killers), which could have financial impacts.” Unlike other pesticides, paraquat works well in low temperatures and early in the season, according to the agency.</p><div><div><div><p>“What we’ve seen over the course of decades is a systemic failure to protect farmworkers and the agricultural community from pesticides.”</p></div><p>Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz from EarthJustice</p></div></div><p id="2JUORFJJCJGV3FHSBIL4RL2PPM">More than 200,000 public comments have been submitted to the EPA’s docket on paraquat over the years. Industry groups, farmers, advocacy organizations and others have all chimed in, arguing for or against the weed killer.</p><p id="KDQMEVORGFAS3N7SVIWSJFJAPE">One submitted by a North Dakota farmer, Trey Fischbach, urged the EPA to continue allowing paraquat to fight resistant weeds like kochia, writing it’s the “last tool in the toolbox.” </p><p id="HOO2H3BTHNGCHNY34WIRMNU4OA">The EPA also noted there weren’t many other options. “The chemical characteristics of paraquat are also beneficial as a resistance management tool, where few alternatives are available.” </p><p id="ANVFXM4LIZBUVDBEXGLE75CAMI">But farmers can get trapped on what critics call the “<a href="https://www.panna.org/resources/the-pesticide-treadmill/" target="_blank" rel="">pesticide treadmill</a>,” in which broad pesticide use leads to “superweeds” that require stronger and stronger pesticides to be knocked down.</p><p id="WMHATQ6VW5D5VJ6WZL7D5XIMD4">A comment submitted by Kay O’Laughlin, from Massachusetts, urged instead: “Do your job and ban paraquat because it is killing people. I speak as someone who lost a brother to Parkinson’s. People should not be disposable so that big agro can make ever greater profits!”</p><p id="ST7LZTJNG5D7BLMJN7BLZDWUX4">The EPA’s 2021 decision was challenged within two months by environmental and farmworker groups who sued the EPA. Kalmuss-Katz said the groups challenged the EPA over reapproving paraquat without “truly grappling” with the connection to Parkinson’s.</p><p id="7TQ6CZ24SNDTPET5JMIE2CBIDE">“The EPA here failed to adequately protect farmworkers,” he said.</p><p id="N5FTKEU5GBHW7C6IJW3HWAHAHA">After that, the environmental agency shifted under President Joe Biden. </p><p id="GAYRCOE5WNFINGLHJSQRJOLB5Q">The EPA decided to consider the issues raised in the lawsuits and started seeking additional information last year. In early 2025, it asked the courts for more time to assess the human health risks of paraquat.</p><p id="EVK5BC2DOVH6ND2ZIXAQ3AVMNQ">But the EPA wasn’t focused on Parkinson’s, saying in its decision the “weight of evidence was insufficient” to link paraquat exposure to the neurological disease. Rather, the federal question was over how the weed killer turns into a vapor that could harm people when inhaled or touched. “Parkinson’s Disease is not an expected health outcome of pesticidal use of paraquat,” the EPA said in its review. </p><p id="NE5I2W6LO5BYNNLYCBLZBHK2LY">The study could take up to four years, according to the EPA, saying it’s “complex, large scale and is conducted under real world conditions,” while paraquat remains on the market. The <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OPP-2011-0855-0554" target="_blank" rel="">agency in October</a> updated the review, saying it’s now seeking additional information from Syngenta. </p><p id="5AT4THVERJGOLMIZJSEAS63CNQ">Meanwhile, the EPA has shifted again. The Trump administration this year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/climate/from-industry-to-epa-lobbyist-now-oversees-pesticide-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="">put four former industry lobbyists</a> or executives, from the agricultural, chemical and cleaning industries, in charge of regulating pesticides at the EPA. </p><p id="2BCAIDNAJRDIVHNCVNYDD3ZT3E">And while it’s not clear where the agency stands on paraquat, there has been an early sign of backing away from opposition to controversial pesticides. Shortly after Kyle Kunkler, a recent American Soybean Association lobbyist, was tapped to lead pesticide policy, the EPA moved to reapprove the use of <a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/pesticides/EPA-allow-new-dicamba-herbicides/103/web/2025/07" target="_blank" rel="">a different, controversial weed killer</a> that had previously been banned by federal courts.</p><h2>Growing pressure to ban it</h2><p id="KIE4VEVGPFAYFEAXHJ7PT74PPM">But grassroots pressure to ban paraquat continues to mount.</p><p id="YRPVDBB45FHV3JDLWBID2RHIGY">“This is a pivotal time for whether paraquat is going to remain active in the United States,” said Simmons, a legal expert for Drugwatch.</p><p id="YZHJ4EKKUJAJ5LD6DMQD3O7FIY">Last year, more than 50 Democratic lawmakers, expressing “grave concern” in letters, urged the EPA to ban paraquat.</p><p id="NIAR7O7LD5AUBDL3NLGQWZCG2Y">“Due to their heightened exposure to paraquat, farmworkers and rural residents are hardest hit by the harmful health effects of paraquat like Parkinson’s,” said <a href="https://casar.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/casar.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/casar-paraquat-epa-letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="">an Oct. 7, 2024</a>, letter signed by U.S. representatives.
