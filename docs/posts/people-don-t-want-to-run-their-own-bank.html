    <h1>People don&#39;t want to run their own bank</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
<p>When I was young, I had a piggy bank. A piggy bank is <em>incredibly</em> secure. It&#39;s fairly big  - so it is hard to lose. It is brightly coloured - so you can find it easily. No one else can see how much money there is in there. The only way to get money out is to smash it - providing visible evidence if someone has robbed you. And smashing makes a noise - deterring would-be thieves.</p><p>A piggy bank is close to <strong>perfect</strong> security. If you are seven and your adversary is a younger sibling.</p><p>Storing your own money is a mug&#39;s game. Having a fiver on you for emergencies might be sensible - but stuffing cash under your mattress is not advisable. Loss, theft, and fire are all real concerns.</p><p>The world is moving away from cash. Just before the pandemic, <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/01/a-year-of-going-cashless-and-where-it-hasnt-worked/">I went a year without using cash</a>. Since then, I haven&#39;t withdrawn any notes.</p><p>Holding on to cash is like running your own bank. You have to check that the money you&#39;re given isn&#39;t counterfeit, store it safely, insure against loss, protect against theft, project future needs, etc. It is a <em>massive</em> faff.</p><p>So people use banks. In the UK, they&#39;re mostly free. I give an institution my money and, due to a combination of their size, insurance, and regulators, I&#39;m confident that my money will still be there tomorrow. They are unlikely to give me fake notes, and they can refund me if I&#39;ve been defrauded. I trust them.</p><p>Enter the crypto-dudes with their plaintive cry &#34;<em>But I shouldn&#39;t <strong>have</strong> to trust anyone!</em>&#34;</p><p>Sure. I fully support your <em>right</em> to get paid in cash and to store all of it in a lockable box guarded by your dog.</p><p>But don&#39;t come running to me when the dog eats all over your notes and shits them out in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>As Moxie wrote a few weeks ago that <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">most people don&#39;t want to run their own servers</a>. I&#39;m a massive nerd and run a few servers. And it is a pain in the arse! This website runs on someone else&#39;s cloud infrastructure so it doesn&#39;t break too often. I don&#39;t have the time, energy, or skill to <em>securely</em> run important servers all by my self.</p><p>Do people want to <a href="https://twitter.com/rabbyte/status/1479940112477831173">manage their own cryptographic keys</a>? I doubt it. It&#39;s complicated and fragile.</p><p>The complexity can be magically managed away with better technology and usability. Up to a point. You no longer need a degree in electronics to tune in to a radio station. But look at the number of people who don&#39;t know how to re-tune their car radio&#39;s presets.</p><p>So people will gather around big institutions. Those which have the funds, insurance, and regulatory oversight to provide a reasonable degree of trust.</p><p>Sure, some people will hold on to their own cryptokeys - just like some people only want to be paid in cash. But, just as now, they&#39;ll be the minority.</p><p>There&#39;s an inherent fragility built into cryptocurrencies. If your physical bank notes are damaged, <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/damaged-and-contaminated-banknotes">the bank will replace them</a>. If you are defrauded, <a href="https://www.lendingstandardsboard.org.uk/crm-code/">the bank will reimburse you</a>.  If your loved one dies, and you inherit their assets, the bank is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/probate-estate">legally obliged to give you access</a>.</p><p>Cryptocurrency has <em>none</em> of that.</p><ul><li>If your hardware wallet or keys are destroyed, you&#39;ve lost everything.</li><li>If you are defrauded, you&#39;ve lost everything.</li><li>If your loved one dies and didn&#39;t give you access, you&#39;ve lost everything.</li></ul><p>Would you carry around your life savings in your wallet? Would you store everything of value in your home in a safe? Would you want to run your own banking infrastructure?</p><p>I doubt it.</p><p>The &#34;not-your-keys-not-your-crypto&#34; folk want us to return to an almost prehistoric means of storing and transporting money.  Thankfully, most people realise how backwards that is.</p></div></div>
