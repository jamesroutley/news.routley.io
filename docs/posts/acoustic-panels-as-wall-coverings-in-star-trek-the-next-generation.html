    <h1>Acoustic Panels as Wall Coverings in Star Trek: The Next Generation</h1>

<p>Acoustic panels can be seen on the walls of several rooms in Star Trek: The Next Generation. As the sets of the series were re-used for &#34;Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country&#34;, the wall panels appear in the movie as well. The following table provides an overview of the panel or tile types that were used and of the locations where they are visible.</p>

			<p><span>Nitpicking</span> While the panels on the port side of Ten Foward remained the same for the whole run of the series, the starboard panels were turned 90 degrees for the fifth season after the set had been used for the President&#39;s office in &#34;Star Trek: &#34;The Undiscovered Country&#34;. We can see the old orientation in &#34;In Theory&#34; (left) and the new one in &#34;Ensign Ro&#34;.</p>
			<p>The change of the tiles in Ten Forward leads to an error in ENT: &#34;These Are The Voyages&#34;. The episode combines <a href="https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/observations/ent_vs_tng.htm">stock footage of Ten Forward from &#34;Ménage à Troi&#34;</a> (left) with newly filmed scenes in the reconstructed set with Troi and Riker (right). The reconstruction correctly reproduces the tiles as they looked at the time of &#34;The Pegasus&#34; in the seventh season. The stock footage still shows the old orientation as in the third season.</p>

<h2>Annotations</h2>

<p>Overview originally compiled by <a href="https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#096b607d7d6c7b61666f49646c6e687a6a7b6c6c67276d6c">Frank Bitterhof</a>. The list may not yet be complete, other uses of SONEX and/or CONTOUR acoustic products on Star Trek will be added once these have been spotted.</p>

<p>Different size indications for the USA and Europe reflect different industry standards (e.g. European SONEX One panels can be assembled seamlessly without any extra need for cutting panels prior to assembling a uniform pattern because each element is 125mm², i.e. European SONEX One is exactly 5 elements wide and 10 elements long).</p>

	<p>You are a home theater owner who is looking forward to improve his room acoustics? You would like to give your home theater a Star Trek theme on a tight budget? You are a Star Trek fan who&#39;d like to use / display some &#34;authentic&#34; 24th century materials for room decoration or your collection?</p>

	<p>In either case, you&#39;d probably want to consider the acoustic SONEX® panels and CONTOUR® tiles the producers of television&#39;s renowned series <i>Star Trek - The Next Generation </i>chose for various decoration purposes.</p>

	<p>The different SONEX® panels and CONTOUR® tiles used in TNG will allow an infinite abundance of combinations to convert each room into a Starfleet interior and thus create a perfect environment to re-experience your favorite TNG episodes (since 2012 available in breathtaking high definition <a href="https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/observations/tng-r-review.htm">Blu-ray disc quality</a>).</p>
