<p>Security researchers hacked a Tesla Modem and collected awards of $722,500 on the first day of Pwn2Own Automotive 2024 for three bug collisions and 24 unique zero-day exploits.</p>
<p>Synacktiv Team (<a href="https://twitter.com/Synacktiv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">@Synacktiv</a>) took home $100,000 after successfully chaining three zero-day bugs <a href="https://twitter.com/thezdi/status/1750009207724916989" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">to get root permissions on a Tesla Modem</a>.</p>
<p>They also used two unique two-bug chains to hack a <a href="https://twitter.com/thezdi/status/1750040225320202441" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ubiquiti Connect EV Station</a> and a JuiceBox 40 Smart EV Charging Station, earning an additional $120,000.</p>
<p>A third exploit chain targeting the <a href="https://twitter.com/thezdi/status/1750074555266404374" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ChargePoint Home Flex EV charger</a> was already known but still brought them $16,000 in cash, with a total of $295,000 in prizes during the first day of the contest.</p>
<p>Security researchers also successfully hacked multiple fully patched EV charging stations and infotainment systems, with the NCC Group EDG team taking the second place on the leaderboard after winning $70,000 for zero-days exploited to hack the <a href="https://twitter.com/thezdi/status/1750032135363383725" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Pioneer DMH-WT7600NEX infotainment system</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/thezdi/status/1750092629885460966" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Phoenix Contact CHARX SEC-3100 EV charger</a>.</p>
<p>After the zero-day bugs are exploited and reported during the Pwn2Own competition, vendors have 90 days to develop and release security fixes before TrendMicro&#39;s Zero Day Initiative publicly discloses them.</p>

<p>â€‹The Pwn2Own Automotive 2024 hacking contest focuses on automotive technologies and takes place this week in Tokyo, Japan, during the <a href="https://www.automotiveworld.jp/tokyo/en-gb.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Automotive World</a> auto conference between January 24 and January 26.</p>
<p>Throughout the competition, security researchers will be able to target Tesla in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems, electric vehicle (EV) chargers, and car operating systems (i.e., Automotive Grade Linux, BlackBerry QNX, Android Automotive OS).</p>
<p>They&#39;ll also demo zero-day exploits targeting Tesla Model 3/Y (Ryzen-based) or Tesla Model S/X (Ryzen-based) systems, including the infotainment system, modem, tuner, wireless, and autopilot.</p>
<p>The top prize will be awarded for VCSEC, gateway, or autopilot zero-days, with a cash award of $200,000 and a Tesla car.</p>
<p>You can find the complete schedule of this year&#39;s automotive hacking contest <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2024/1/23/pwn2own-automotive-2024-the-full-schedule" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. The full schedule for the first day and the results for each challenge are available <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2024/1/24/pwn2own-automotive-2024-day-one-results" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-earn-1-035-000-for-27-zero-days-exploited-at-pwn2own-vancouver/" target="_blank">the Pwn2Own Vancouver 2023 competition</a> in March, security researchers earned $1,035,000 and a Tesla Model 3 car after demoing 27 zero-day (and several bug collisions).</p>
