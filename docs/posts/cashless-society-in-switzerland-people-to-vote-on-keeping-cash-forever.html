    <h1>Cashless society in Switzerland? People to vote on keeping cash forever</h1>

    </time></p></div><div><p>Swiss citizens will get the chance to try to ensure their economy never becomes cashless, a pressure group said, after collecting enough signatures on Monday to trigger a popular vote on the issue.</p><p>The Free Switzerland Movement (FBS) says cash is playing a shrinking role in many economies, as electronic payments become the default for transactions in increasingly digitised societies, making it easier for the state to monitor its citizens&#39; actions.</p><p>It wants a clause added to Switzerland&#39;s currency law, which governs how the central bank and government manage the money supply, stipulating that a &#34;sufficient quantity&#34; of banknotes or coins must always remain in circulation.</p><p>There is no evidence of moves towards a cashless society by Swiss authorities.</p><p>FBS said it had garnered over 111,000 signatures in support of the measure, above the 100,000 needed to trigger a popular vote. </p><h2>In defence of cash</h2><p>Under Switzerland&#39;s system of direct democracy, the proposal would become law if approved by voters, though government and parliament would decide how that law was implemented.</p><p>&#34;It is clear that... getting rid of cash not only touches on issues of transparency, simplicity or security... but also carries a huge danger of totalitarian surveillance,&#34; FBS president Richard Koller said on the group&#39;s website.</p><p>He also views Switzerland as a European standard-bearer for the defence of cash, as pushing through such guarantees in the European Union would entail the &#34;almost impossible&#34; process of securing approval from all 27 member states.</p><p>Accelerated by the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns, the trend towards increased cashless payments was evident as far back as 2017, when an Ipsos study found more than a third of Europeans and Americans would happily go without cash and 20 per cent pretty much did so already.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
