      <p>
        This page measures the concentration of the <a href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse</a> and the <a href="https://atproto.com/">Atmosphere</a> according to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index">Herfindahlâ€“Hirschman
          Index</a> (HHI),
        an indicator from economics used to measure competition between firms in
        an industry.
        Mathematically, HHI is the sum of the squares of market shares of all servers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Values close to zero indicate perfectly competitive markets (eg. many servers, with users
        spread evenly), while values close to 10000 indicate highly concentrated monopolies (eg.
        most users on a single server). In economics, values below 100 are considered
        &#34;Highly Competitive&#34;, below 1500 is &#34;Unconcentrated&#34;, and above 2500 is
        considered &#34;Highly Concentrated&#34;.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site currently measures the concentration of user data for active users: in the
        Fediverse, this data is on <a href="https://w3c.github.io/activitypub/#server-to-server-interactions">servers</a> (also known as instances);
        in the Atmosphere, it is on the
        <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#pds-personal-data-server">PDSes</a>
        that host users&#39; <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#data-repo">data repos</a>. Other metrics and
        comparisons are possible, and I&#39;m interested in exploring them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Code and data are available <a href="https://github.com/ricci/distributed-social-networks/">on
          GitHub</a>.
        Comments and pull requests, including other metrics for measuring
        distribution and resiliency, are welcome!
