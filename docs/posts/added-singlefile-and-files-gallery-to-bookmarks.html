    <h1>Added SingleFile and files.gallery to bookmarks</h1>

    <p>I’ve discovered a couple of small projects: SingleFile and files.gallery that merited inclusion in my bookmarks section: <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202312091215.html">Projects &amp; companies</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile">SingleFile</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A browser extension (and CLI utility) that converts complex webpages into self-contained html files for archival purposes. The 2024 archive.org takedown made me realize that, for pages that I might want to reference far into the future, it’s safer to archive things on my own rather than rely on a third party. SingleFile makes this easy and (hopefully) outputs to a durable file format that I can rely on in the long term.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://files.gallery">files.gallery</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A single-file PHP application that you can drop into a directory on a web server which creates a rich listing of the files within. I’ve ended up purchasing a license because this is by far the best option I’ve found for self-hosting galleries of photos to share with friends/family.</p>

<p>Separately, I’ve also updated my <a href="http://localhost:4000/wiki/202406161417.html">adopt-or-avoid evaluation</a> for Bluesky to reflect their <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a">recent Series A raise</a> from Blockchain Capital. Spoiler alert: it’s a red flag!</p>
