<p><span>O</span>n the occasion of the 200th year of Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev’s birth, we survey his works on mechanical linkages. Let us first explain the main object considered in this paper. A <i>mechanical linkage</i> is a set of rigid bars connected with each other at the ends by revolving hinges. This construction can move and bend in the hinges and take different <i>configurations</i>. A natural example of a linkage is an arm of a human or a leg of an animal with its bones as bars and joints as links. The main purpose of  linkages is to produce different kinds of motions, and humankind has been using them in engineering since antiquity.</p>

For example, the pantograph—a tool for copying and scaling writings and drawings—was invented in the beginning of the 17th century by Christoph Scheiner (an illustration from his book <i>Pantografice</i> is represented in Fig. 1). But the most remarkable progress in the study and creation of mechanical linkages was made in Europe in the 19th century, when all branches of mechanics and engineering started developing rapidly as part of the Industrial Revolution. The geometrical and analytical properties of these mechanisms also gave a new impetus for research in purely mathematical fields, and this process was continued later in the 20th century. In the rest of this paper we survey the work in this field made by Chebyshev, one of the most influential 19th century mathematicians, and examine the connections between these results and the work of other scientists. For the convenience of the reader, we shall avoid technical details. Most of the illustrations are taken from Chebyshev’s original papers.</p>
<p>Chebyshev was interested in mechanics from a young age, but his research in this field started only after a voyage to Europe which he undertook in June–October 1852. It was a scientific trip sponsored by the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. During this journey, Chebyshev established connections with famous European mathematicians and, alongside with his theoretical research, observed factories and workshops, learning about the latest achievements in engineering and machinery. After his return, in the period 1852–1856, he gave lectures on applied mechanics at the Alexandrovsky Imperial Lyceum, in addition to his work at the University of Saint Petersburg.</p>

These papers were written either in Russian or in French. All these works can be found in the French version of Chebyshev’s Collected Works <a id="link-3" data-trigger="focus" href="#!" data-toggle="popover">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>These works can be considered as multiple parts of one long line of research. The word “parallelogram” that appears in several titles of these papers was first used to denote a specific mechanism, namely, Watt’s parallelogram, and its improvements. In later works, it was used by Chebyshev to denote linkages somehow related to this mechanism. The titles of the papers have a mechanical connotation, but the content of most of them is purely mathematical. It is worthwhile to say that Chebyshev used linkages to develop the theory of approximations of functions.</p>
<p>The bars of a linkage are related via algebraic relations between the coordinates of the links or chosen points on the bars. Therefore, if the position of some points of the linkage on the plane are fixed, then the trajectories of the other moving points are algebraic curves. The natural questions that arise here are: What kind of algebraic curves can be obtained by these motions? What curves on the plane can be approximated by the curves traced out by chosen points on the linkages? Although Chebyshev turned his attention to the general theory of approximations, these questions remained important. William Thurston and Nikolai Mnev turned the gaze back to these questions in the last quarter of the 20th century, resulting in proving a series of universality theorems for linkages. For an exposition of the modern history of this question see~<a id="link-2" data-trigger="focus" href="#!" data-toggle="popover">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Now we shall say a few words about Watt, since Chebyshev refers to him in several of his papers. James Watt (1736–1819) was a Scottish engineer, and one of the pioneers of the Industrial Revolution. One of his famous inventions was an improvement of the steam engine (the first steam engine invented by Thomas Newcomen was extremely inefficient). Watt’s name is also used to denote a SI unit of power.</p>

Formally, there are two linkages which are denoted by this name, the reduced one (“Watt’s linkage”) being a part of the full one (“Watt’s parallelogram”). We shall explain first the reduced one (Fig. 4).</p></div></div>
