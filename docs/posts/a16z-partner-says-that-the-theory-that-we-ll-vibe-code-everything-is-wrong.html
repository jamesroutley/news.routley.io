Relying on AI to write code also carries risks, he said.</p><p>&#34;You have this innovation bazooka with these models. Why would you point it at rebuilding payroll or ERP or CRM,&#34; Acharya said, referring to enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management software. Salesforce, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP are among the top providers of such software.</p><p>Instead, companies are better off using AI to develop their core businesses or optimize the remaining 90% of their costs, said the venture capitalist of six years.</p><p>&#34;Of course, there will be secular losers. There are specific business models that are now going to be disadvantaged,&#34; he said. &#34;But the general story that we&#39;re going to vibe code everything is flat wrong, and the whole market is oversold software.&#34;</p><p>Acharya&#39;s comments follow a brutal week for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-today-tech-selloff-oil-prices-spike-nvda-avgo-2026-2?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:software stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">software stocks</a>, which dragged down tech and broader markets. The sell-off started when already-wary investors panicked about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-cowork-legal-plugin-publishing-stocks-legalzoom-thomson-reuters-relx-2026-2?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anthropic&#39;s new AI tool;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"><u>Anthropic&#39;s new AI tool</u></a>, which can perform a range of clerical tasks for people working in the legal industry.</p><p>The A16z partner joins famed investor Vinod Khosla in saying that stock prices should be ignored when evaluating the future of tech companies.</p><p>On a podcast last month, Khosla dismissed talks of an AI bubble and said investors should not be concerned as long as API call volume, a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vinod-khosla-looks-at-this-metric-to-gauge-ai-bubble-2026-1?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:benchmark of AI usage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">benchmark of AI usage</a>, remains high.</p><p>&#34;If that&#39;s your fundamental metric of what&#39;s the real use of your AI, usefulness of AI, demand for AI, you&#39;re not going to see a bubble in API calls,&#34; he said. &#34;What Wall Street tends to do with it, I don&#39;t really care. I think it&#39;s mostly irrelevant.&#34;</p><p>Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/a16z-partner-says-businesses-cannot-vibe-code-everything-tech-stocks-2026-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Business Insider;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Business Insider</a></p></div></div>
