Performance Trends by Percentiles</h3><div><div><h4>Reading scores decline at all selected percentiles since 2020 </h4><p>NAEP reports scores at five selected percentiles to show changes over time by lower- (10th and 25th percentiles), middle- (50th percentile), and higher- (75th and 90th percentiles) performing students. Percentiles are useful for understanding how overall score gains or losses are distributed across the student population and provide context for the national average score.</p><p>The 2023 reading scores for age 13 students at all five selected percentile levels declined compared to 2020. The declines ranged from 3 to 4 points for middle- and higher-performing students to 6 to 7 points for lower-performing students, though the score declines of lower performers were not significantly different from those of their middle- and higher-performing peers. </p></div></div><div><div data-figure="percentile-reading-13-nation"><div><h5 data-figure-title="" id="percentile-reading-13-nation"><span>Figure</span> <span>Trend in NAEP long-term trend reading scores at five selected percentiles for 13-year-old students</span></h5></div><div><div><div><div><p>Legend</p><p><span><svg height="30" width="30" viewBox="0 0 30 30"><g transform="translate(15, 15)"><path d="M8.64121720680551,0L4.320608603402755,-7.48351362071278L-4.320608603402755,-7.48351362071278L-8.64121720680551,0L-4.320608603402755,7.48351362071278L4.320608603402755,7.48351362071278Z"></path></g></svg></span><span><span>90th Percentile</span></span></p><p><span><svg height="30" width="30" viewBox="0 0 30 30"><g transform="translate(15, 15)"><path d="M-6.96419413859206,-6.96419413859206h13.92838827718412v13.92838827718412h-13.92838827718412Z"></path></g></svg></span><span><span>75th Percentile</span></span></p><p><span><svg height="30" width="30" viewBox="0 0 30 30"><g transform="translate(15, 15)"><path d="M0,-12.961825810208264L7.48351362071278,0L0,12.961825810208264L-7.48351362071278,0Z"></path></g></svg></span><span><span>50th Percentile</span></span></p><p><span><svg height="30" width="30" viewBox="0 0 30 30"><g transform="translate(15, 15)"><path d="M-9.343446901438462,-3.1144823004794873L-3.1144823004794873,-3.1144823004794873L-3.1144823004794873,-9.343446901438462L3.1144823004794873,-9.343446901438462L3.1144823004794873,-3.1144823004794873L9.343446901438462,-3.1144823004794873L9.343446901438462,3.1144823004794873L3.1144823004794873,3.1144823004794873L3.1144823004794873,9.343446901438462L-3.1144823004794873,9.343446901438462L-3.1144823004794873,3.1144823004794873L-9.343446901438462,3.1144823004794873Z"></path></g></svg></span><span><span>25th Percentile</span></span></p><p><span><svg height="30" width="30" viewBox="0 0 30 30"><g transform="translate(15, 15)"><path d="M7.858251581595959,0A7.858251581595959,7.858251581595959,0,1,1,-7.858251581595959,0A7.858251581595959,7.858251581595959,0,1,1,7.858251581595959,0"></path></g></svg></span><span><span>10th Percentile</span></span></p><p><span><span>NOTE: <!-- -->The NAEP long-term trend (LTT) assessment results are reported by the year in  which the school year ends.

In mathematics, scores declined compared to 2020 for most student groups; for example, scores were lower for Black, Hispanic, and White 13-year-olds, for students attending schools in all regions of the country, for students eligible and not eligible for the NSLP, and for students at all reported levels of parental education. </p><p>See average score results for selected student groups through the drop-down menu selection below. Symbols in the figure indicate the score change between two sets of assessment years: from 2012 to 2020 and from 2020 to 2023. For example, in the figure below for race/ethnicity, the gray diamonds indicate that the 2020 reading score was not significantly different from the 2012 score for any racial/ethnic group with reportable results, and the down arrows indicate that 2023 reading scores declined for White and Black students and for students of Two or More Races in comparison to 2020.</p><p>In mathematics, the 11-point score decrease for female students compared to the 7-point decrease for male students resulted in a widening of the Male−Female score gap in comparison to 2020. Also, the 13-point score decrease among Black students compared to the 6-point decrease among White students resulted in a widening of the White−Black score gap from 35 points in 2020 to 42 points in 2023. In reading, there were no statistically significant changes in these score gaps in 2023 compared to 2020.</p></div></div><div><div><div><h5 data-figure-title=""><span>Figure</span> <span>Changes in NAEP long-term trend reading and mathematics average scores for 13-year-old students, by race/ethnicity: 2012, 2020, and 2023</span></h5></div><div><div><div><div><p>Legend</p><p><span><svg height="30" width="30" viewBox="0 0 30 30"><g transform="translate(15, 15)"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="30" height="30" viewBox="0 0 50 50" x="-15" y="-15" aria-label="up arrow"><path d="M35.52,27.91a2.42,2.42,0,0,0,3.42.15L39,28l1.1-1.11a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,0-3.41h0L26.7,10.05a2.41,2.41,0,0,0-3.41,0h0L9.92,23.43a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,0,3.41h0L11,28a2.42,2.42,0,0,0,3.42,0l0,0,7.3-7.61V38.71a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,2.4,2.42h1.63a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,2.42-2.4s0,0,0,0V20.3l7.3,7.61Z" direction="up"></path><path d="M25,50A25,25,0,1,1,50,25,25,25,0,0,1,25,50ZM35.52,27.91a2.42,2.42,0,0,0,3.42.15L39,28l1.1-1.11a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,0-3.41h0L26.7,10.05a2.41,2.41,0,0,0-3.41,0h0L9.92,23.43a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,0,3.41h0L11,28a2.42,2.42,0,0,0,3.42,0l0,0,7.3-7.61V38.71a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,2.4,2.42h1.63a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,2.42-2.4s0,0,0,0V20.3l7.3,7.61Z" direction="up"></path></svg></g></svg></span><span><span>Score increase</span></span></p><p><span><svg height="30" width="30" viewBox="0 0 30 30"><g transform="translate(15, 15)"><path d="M0,-13.228756555322954L13.228756555322954,0L0,13.228756555322954L-13.228756555322954,0Z"></path></g></svg></span><span><span>No significant change</span></span></p><p><span><svg height="30" width="30" viewBox="0 0 30 30"><g transform="translate(15, 15)"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="30" height="30" viewBox="0 0 50 50" x="-15" y="-15" aria-label="down arrow"><path d="M35.52,22.09l-7.3,7.61V11.29a2.41,2.41,0,0,0-2.42-2.42H24.19a2.41,2.41,0,0,0-2.42,2.42V29.7l-7.3-7.61A2.42,2.42,0,0,0,11,22l-1.1,1.11a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,0,3.42L23.29,39.95a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,3.42,0L40.08,26.57a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,0-3.42L39,22a2.42,2.42,0,0,0-3.46,0Z" direction="down"></path><path d="M50,25A25,25,0,1,1,25,0,25,25,0,0,1,50,25ZM35.52,22.09l-7.3,7.61V11.29a2.41,2.41,0,0,0-2.42-2.42H24.19a2.41,2.41,0,0,0-2.42,2.42V29.7l-7.3-7.61A2.42,2.42,0,0,0,11,22l-1.1,1.11a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,0,3.42L23.29,39.95a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,3.42,0L40.08,26.57a2.41,2.41,0,0,0,0-3.42L39,22a2.42,2.42,0,0,0-3.46,0Z" direction="down"></path></svg></g></svg></span><span><span>Score decrease</span></span></p><p><span><svg width="30" height="30"><line x1="0" y1="15" x2="30" y2="15"></line></svg></span><span><span>NAEP long-term trend performance levels for age 13</span></span></p><p><span><span>NOTE: <!-- -->Results are not shown for Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander students because reporting standards were not met.

Student Learning Experience</h3><div><div><p> Students who took the long-term trend assessments in reading and mathematics during the 2022–23 school year also responded to a survey questionnaire. Students taking the long-term trend reading assessment were asked how often they read for fun on their own time; students taking the long-term trend mathematics assessment were asked which type of mathematics course they were currently taking; and all students were asked about the number of days they had been absent from school in the previous month.</p><p>Students’ responses to survey questions provide information with which to compare performance based on their self-reported characteristics and educational experiences. This information may be valuable in helping parents, educators, and policymakers understand what aspects of students’ experiences are related to achievement. Survey questionnaire results, however, do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the characteristic or experience and student achievement. NAEP is not designed to identify the causes of performance differences. Numerous factors interact to influence student achievement, including local educational policies and practices, the quality of teachers, and available resources. Such factors may change over time and vary among student groups.</p><h4>Percentage of students missing 5 or more days of school monthly has doubled since 2020</h4><p>Students who took the 2023 long-term trend reading and mathematics assessments were asked how many days of school they had missed in the last month. Responses to the survey question for both subjects indicate a decrease in the percentages of 13-year-old students reporting having missed none to 2 days in the past month compared to 2020. Conversely, there were increases in the percentages of 13-year-old students who reported missing 3 or 4 days and students who reported missing 5 or more days in the last month.

More About the Age 13 Assessment Content and Sample</h3><div><div><p>Since the 1970s, the NAEP long-term trend assessments have been administered to monitor the academic performance of students across three age levels (9-, 13-, and 17-year-old students). This report mainly focuses on the comparison of age 13 students (typically in grade 8) between 2020 and 2023. A report card summarizing results for 9- and 13-year-old students across all administrations back to the 1970s is forthcoming.</p><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><div><div><div><p>There are several differences between long-term trend and main NAEP assessments in reading and mathematics.</p>
<ul>
<li>LTT reading was first administered in 1971 and LTT mathematics was first administered in 1973. Main NAEP assessments in reading and mathematics date back to the 1990s; frameworks for these assessments are periodically revised to reflect curricular changes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>LTT assessments in reading and mathematics are administered to students sampled by age, while main NAEP assessments are administered to students sampled by grade.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>LTT assessments in reading and mathematics are less frequently updated than main NAEP assessments in these subjects and are less reflective of changes in curriculum.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>LTT assessments are paper-based, while main NAEP assessments are digitally-based.</li>
</ul>
<p>The instruments and methodologies of LTT and main NAEP assessment programs are different; therefore, direct comparisons between the LTT results presented in this report and the assessment results presented in other main NAEP reports are not possible.

</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><div><div><p>Although the LTT assessments are typically administered every four years, NCES decided to administer the long-term trend assessments to provide data on post-pandemic student performance. The assessments at age 13 were administered from October to December of the 2022–23 school year. Results are based on a nationally representative sample of approximately 8,700 students in each subject. Of the 460 schools that participated in 2023, eighty-two percent had participated in 2020. The LTT data collection at age 13 complements the data previously collected and reported for age 9.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><div><div><div><p>The long-term trend (LTT) assessment in reading requires age 13 students to read a variety of short texts (expository pieces, poems, riddles, advertisements, and story excerpts) and to respond to questions about what they read. Students participating in the 2023 LTT reading assessment read passages and responded to questions in three 15-minute sections. Each section contained three or four short passages and approximately 10 questions. The majority of questions were presented in a multiple-choice format, though most sections included one constructed-response question.</p>
<p>Assessment questions are designed to measure reading comprehension skills, primarily to</p>
<ul>
<li>locate specific information in the text provided;</li>
<li>make inferences based on information in two or more parts of the text; and</li>
<li>identify the main idea in the text.</li>
</ul>
<p>The LTT assessment in mathematics requires age 13 students to respond to a variety of questions designed to measure</p>
<ul>
<li>knowledge of basic mathematical facts;</li>
<li>ability to carry out computations using paper and pencil;</li>
<li>knowledge of basic measurement formulas, as they are applied in geometric settings; and</li>
<li>ability to apply mathematics to daily living skills, such as those involving time and money.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students participating in the LTT mathematics assessment responded to questions in three 15-minute sections. Most sections contained between 22 and 26 questions. The majority of questions students answered were presented in a multiple-choice format, but some constructed-response questions were included in each of the sections.</p>

Because the scales were developed separately for each subject, comparisons cannot be made from one subject to another. Black includes African American. Hispanic includes Latino. Race categories exclude Hispanic origin. The information about National School Lunch Program (NSLP) variable is based on available school records. If school records were not available, the student was classified as &#34;Information not available.&#34; The category &#34;students with disabilities&#34; includes students identified as having either an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or protection under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The results for students with disabilities and English learners are based on students who were assessed and cannot be generalized to the total population of such students. See more information about <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/ltt/interpreting_results.aspx#repgroups">student group variables</a>. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding or the omission of categories. Although the estimates (e.g., average scores or percentages) are shown as rounded numbers in the charts, the positions of the data points in the graphics are based on the unrounded numbers. Unrounded numbers were used for calculating the differences between the estimates, and for the statistical comparison test when the estimates were compared to each other. Not all apparent differences between estimates are statistically significant. NAEP reports results using widely accepted statistical standards; findings are reported based on a statistical significance level set at .05, with appropriate adjustments for multiple comparisons. Only those differences that are found to be statistically significant are referred to as &#34;higher&#34; or &#34;lower.&#34;</p><p>SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Statistics, National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), various years, 1971–2023 Long-Term Trend (LTT) Reading and Mathematics Assessments.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
