    <h1>Debian switches to 64-bit time for everything</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Venerable Linux distribution Debian is side-stepping the Y2K38 bug – also known as the Unix Epochalypse – by switching to 64-bit time for everything but the oldest of supported hardware, starting with the upcoming Debian 13 &#34;Trixie&#34; release.</p>
<p>&#34;[We will] use 64-bit time_t on 32-bit architectures to avoid the &#39;year 2038 problem&#39; when the existing 32-bit signed int rolls over (potentially setting time back to 1900),&#34; the Debian maintainers say of the move and the problem it aims to fix.</p>

<p>&#34;This is now less than 15 years away and plenty of systems that will have problems have already been shipped. We should stop adding to the problem.&#34;</p>
<p>Readers of a certain vintage will remember well the &#34;Y2K problem,&#34; caused by retrospectively shortsighted attempts to save a couple of bytes by using two-digit years – meaning that &#34;2000&#34; is represented as &#34;00&#34; and assumed to be &#34;1900.&#34; While predictions of aircraft falling from the skies and bank balances being wiped out by negative-decades of interest did not, thankfully, come true, that was purely due to the tireless behind-the-scenes work of software developers who were able to patch affected systems before celebrating the turn of the century.</p>
<p>There&#39;s another, less well-known clock problem looming, however: the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/17/bbc_iplayer_expires_2038/">Unix Epochalypse</a>,which affects any systems that measure time the Unix way – in seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970. Come the very precise time of 03:14:07 UTC on January 19, 2038, the number of seconds elapsed will be larger than can be represented by a signed 32-bit integer. This would be fine if the decision hadn&#39;t been made all those years ago to store the number of seconds in exactly such a format.</p>

    

<p>Rather than the last-minute scramble of the Y2K fix, software developers are already working on its upcoming cousin. Any software written for and running on 64-bit hardware is already safe, but Debian – which was launched by founder Ian Murdock back in 1993, and is the second-oldest actively developed Linux distribution behind the one-month-older Slackware – is the distro of choice for older and resource-constrained embedded devices based on 32-bit processors.</p>

        


        

<p>&#34;There is quite a lot of cost-sensitive 32-bit computing still out there, and still shipping new devices (automotive, IoT, TVs, routers, plant control, building monitoring/control, cheap Android phones),&#34; the Debian developers explain. &#34;Most such new hardware will be running build-from-source OSes like OpenEmbedded, or Alpine, Android, or Gentoo, but the Debian-based niche is likely to remain for some years, and some stuff built with it is likely to be in use/installed for long enough to hit Jan 2038.&#34;</p>

</ul>
<p>The fix is to move to a 64-bit integer, even when running on 32-bit hardware. It&#39;s no small change: Debian&#39;s maintainers found the relevant variable, time_t, &#34;all over the place,&#34; spread across a total of 6,429 packages. As the move requires a breaking change to the application binary interface (ABI), it also has to happen across all affected libraries simultaneously.</p>
<p>While that was a chunk of work, Debian is confident it is now complete and tested enough that the move will be made after the release of Debian 13 &#34;Trixie&#34; – at least for most hardware.</p>
<p>&#34;The i386 port will be left with the existing 32-bit time_t, as a compatibility architecture for existing x86 binaries,&#34; the maintainers say. &#34;A new &#39;i686&#39; x86 ABI/architecture using 64-bit time, and potentially newer ISA features, could be created if there was sufficient enthusiasm for dragging 32-bit x86 into its now very limited future. The hurd-i386 port is not going to be switched, as its kernel lacks support, and efforts are underway instead to switch to hurd-amd64.&#34;</p>
