        <p>This month I sold my 2021 M1 Max Macbook Pro and bought a Framework 13 DIY Edition laptop. After I got everything setup I sat down to write about the experience. Some ~4500 words later I realized I needed to break my thoughts into multiple posts.</p>

</ul>

<p>My new Framework 13 laptop just arrived. After I finally set everything up I started writing a post about the experience. I thought I&#39;d write a <em>little bit</em> about my previous laptops, but a lot of fond memories I had forgotten about came flooding back. The tinkerings and many openings of laptops past. If you will indulge me, I&#39;ve been feeling nostalgic. This is for the other laptop weirdos out there that that feel the same.</p>

<p>In 2008, I managed to get my hands on a Samsung NC10 Netbook in a fancy metallic blue color. [^ Back when netbooks where a thing circle 2007-2013] Prior to this I only had desktops. The specs were pretty humble (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_NC10?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">from wikipedia</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>A single core 1.6 GHz Intel Atom N270</li>
<li>Integrated Intel GMA 950 graphics</li>
<li>1 GB DDR2 RAM</li>
<li>10.2 inch 1024x600 screen and a <em>VGA connector</em> of all things.</li>
<li>83-key keyboard rather than the usual 87 or 88 keys on a laptop.</li>
<li>A 160 GB HDD</li>
</ul>
<p>Something could be done about that though! You could <a href="https://replacethatpart.com/how-to-upgrade-memory-ram-of-the-samsung-nc10-a-complete-guide-2/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">upgrade</a> the RAM to a powerful 2GB. You could replace the slow HDD with an SSD. You could <a href="https://liliputing.com/touchscreen-kit-for-the-samsung-nc10-and-other-netbooks/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">add a touch screen</a>. You could <a href="https://www.atmasphere.net/archives/2009/01/15/the-samsung-nc10-hackintosh?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">make a Hackintosh</a> out of it if you replaced the wifi card. If you wanted to, you could do those things and I was a weirdo, so I did!</p>
<p>I found a lot of fun in trying to get as much as I could out of that hardware. In fact I&#39;d say the act of doing all that was far more enjoyable than actually using the laptop once the tinkering was done. After the novelty and slowness of a Hackintosh wore off I put Linux on the Netbook. I still sought the thrill of the hunt.</p>
<p>I installed a lite weight distro <a href="https://crunchbang.org/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">CrunchBang</a> [^ or just #!] and messed around. I read more about different minimalist distros and came across two others I could hop to: Arch and Gentoo. This feels like an inflection point in my life, I choose to try Arch since I wouldn&#39;t have to compile everything on a single core. [^ Who know what would have happened if I picked Gentoo. I might have a beard now.] The screen was small and I wanted to maximize its usefulness so I started trying tiling WMs. Why not <a href="https://xmonad.org/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">XMonad</a>?</p>
<p>It turns out the GMA950 was undervolted on the NC10. Someone made a shareware tool called the GMABooster that could restore the max clock rate. The original website <a href="http://www.gmabooster.com/home.htm?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">http://www.gmabooster.com/home.htm</a> is long toast and not on wayback. This <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=81429&amp;ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">Arch forum thread</a> has details though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It allows a user, not a manufacturer to choose the desired GMA speed. It combines a sophisticated assembler-level technology and the user-friendly graphic user interface, offering You to near double the GMA core perfomance without even a need to restart a computer..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The package was on AUR so I could squeeze out a little more performance. I could finally watch 480 YouTube videos instead of 360. At some point, long after I had stopped using the netbook, the AUR package became abandoned. I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802113711/https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gmabooster/">adopted it as maintainer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ciferkey/GMABooster_Linux?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">mirrored</a> the binary in GitHub. This was the first time I ever was a package maintainer. [^ I am on a couple random packages in nixpkgs now.] Nowadays the package is memorialized in the the <a href="https://github.com/aur-archive/gmabooster?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">AUR archive</a>.</p>
<p>I had a device that I could repeatedly break and remake. Did I do anything productive or meaningful with it? Absolutely not. Did I learn a lot in the process? I&#39;d say so!</p>

<h3 id="in-the-past-you-could-do-terrible-things-to-macbooks-too">In the past you could do terrible things to Macbooks too</h3>
<p>When I went to College I got a 2011 Macbook Pro. The kind that would overheat and desolder the GPU. [^ Some clever people have found hardware hacks to repair the problem <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/fixing-2011-macbook-pro-booting-grey-screen-amd-radeon-video-glitch?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/fixing-2011-macbook-pro-booting-grey-screen-amd-radeon-video-glitch</a>] Mine managed to last a long time and didn&#39;t need replacing until 2019. The RAM was not built-in yet on Macbooks. Apple said the model could only support up to 8GB total RAM, but you <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/259351?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">could actually</a> get 16GB to work. Also, this was back when Macbooks had CD drives. I replaced the my drive with an <a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/item/Western%20Digital/DDMB5KT1.0/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">Other World Computing DIY Optical Drive to HDD Upgrade Kit</a>. [^ And you could put the drive into an &#34;OWC SuperSlim&#34; enclosure to turn it into a USB CD drive.] and installed SSDs in both slots. With two drives I was able to install rEFInd as a boot manager and triple boot:</p>
<ul>
<li>OSX as a stable install for my course work</li>
<li>Windows for games</li>
<li>Linux so I could break my install repeatedly</li>
</ul>
<p>I iterated on my Arch install so many times that I started to keep a checklist about my setup process to help me remember everything. Certain stylistic choices were set and still used to this day. [^ This is when I started using Inconsolata for a monospace font and Zenburn for a color scheme.] I couldn&#39;t change quite as many things about this laptop, but I still made an effort to change what I could.</p>

<h3 id="as-laptops-grew-thinner-they-grew-more-boring">As laptops grew thinner they grew more boring</h3>
<p>When it came time for a new laptop I was not looking at Macbook Pros anymore. Apple had made changes, like the touch bar and removing magsafe, that felt like they were targeting a different audience. So instead I had been eyeing a ThinkPad.</p>
<p>So I bought a Gen 7 X1 Carbon and... I just used it. No mods were possible on this laptop. When I had an SSD failure I asked Lenovo if they could mail me the drive so I could do the install. They said they had to send someone to confirm the issue. So a technician came out and replaced the drive.</p>

<h3 id="the-gift-and-curse-of-a-free-macbook-pro">The gift and curse of a free Macbook Pro</h3>
<p>Finally in 2023 I was <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/company-news/a-message-from-hubspot-ceo-yamini-rangan?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">laid off by HubSpot</a>. Part of severance was the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Laptops &amp; WFH Set-Up: Impacted employees may keep their HubSpot laptops (it will be cleaned of any company data remotely), as well as any work from home gear like monitors and keyboards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus a pretty high spec 2021 M1 Max Macbook Pro fell into my lap. I gave my X1 Carbon to a friend to avoid creating yet more ewaste that sits in my closet.</p>
<p>The 2021 version was a bit of return to form: touch bar was gone, magsafe was back, etc. However even the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown?utm_source=M1MBPTD&amp;utm_medium=Annotation&amp;utm_campaign=YouTube">iFixit review</a> said the &#34;design represents a major move in the right direction&#34; but still only rated the laptop a 4/10  for repairability. [^ The score was eventually updated to a 5/10 when Apple later released a service manual and access to parts.]</p>
<p>I felt some dissonance though. If I was looking to buy a laptop, I wouldn&#39;t have picked this one. macOS was getting less enjoyable to use with each update. Likewise the Linux Desktop experience was really coming into its own. [^ By 2023 essentially all my games were playable!] However I felt bad about buying a new laptop when I now had a perfectly good one. So I held onto it and once again, no mods were done or could be done with this laptop.</p>

<h3 id="finally-buying-a-framework-13">Finally buying a Framework 13</h3>
<p>I had waited on getting a Framework laptop because I wanted to see them go through a couple iterations. I wanted to see if the promise of repairing, replacing and upgrading actually came true. From what I read it mostly has! [^ People with Framework 15 do seem to be waiting though.]</p>
<p>What changed the decision for me was the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lugging around a powerful 16 inch laptop was a drag. Having a laptop when traveling is nice if I need to hurriedly rebook something. Mobile sites and apps tend to restrict you in weird ways.</li>
<li>Despite being a couple years old, the laptop was still worth a lot. People probably want Macbooks for local LLM inference. So I felt pretty good a buyer will actually use the laptop.</li>
<li>The Framework release a refresh of the 13 with the new AMD chips.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I had a friend get Laptop 13 and attest to liking it. That was the last push I needed to finally buy one. Now I can be a laptop weirdo again.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t change the RAM on laptops now.</p>
<p>You can do all that and more with a Framework laptop.</p>
<p>Weirdo typically has two interpretations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A possibly dangerous person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To both of those I say: all us laptop weirdos can now put a <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/the-snack-drawer-store-now-made-with-real-snacks/43101?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">snack drawer</a> in our laptops.</p>
