By this stage of the conference, you may be tired of hearing the word &#34;agent&#34;. </p><p>You hear the word frequently. However, it appears that everyone is using this term loosely without a clear understanding of what it means or how these coding agents operate internally. It&#39;s time to pull back the hood and show that there is no moat.</p><p>Learning how to build a coding agent is one of the best things you can do for your personal development in 2025, as it teaches you the fundamentals. Once you understand these fundamentals, you&#39;ll move from being a consumer of AI to a producer of AI who can automate things with AI.</p><p>Let me open with the following facts:</p><figure><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.002.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.002.png 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.002.png 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.002.png 1600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.002.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>it&#39;s not that hard</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.003.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.003.png 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.003.png 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.003.png 1600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.003.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>to build a coding agent</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.004.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.004.png 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.004.png 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.004.png 1600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.004.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>it&#39;s 300 lines of code</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.005.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.005.png 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.005.png 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.005.png 1600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.005.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>running in a loop</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.006.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.006.png 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.006.png 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.006.png 1600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/07/how-to-build-a-agent.006.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>With LLM tokens, that&#39;s all it is. </p><p>300 lines of code running in a loop with LLM tokens.

This is one of the things that&#39;s changing in our industry, because work can be done concurrently and whilst you are away from your computer. </p><p>The days of spending a week or a couple of days on a research spike are now over because you can turn an idea into execution just by speaking to your computer. </p><p>The next time you&#39;re on a Zoom call, consider that you could&#39;ve had an agent building the work that you&#39;re planning to do during that Zoom call.

If your coworkers are hopping between multiple agents, chewing on ideas, and running in the background during meetings, and you&#39;re not in on that action, then naturally you&#39;re just going to fall behind.</blockquote><figure><a href="https://ghuntley.com/ngmi/"><div><p>What do I mean by some software devs are “ngmi”?</p><p>At “an oh fuck moment in time”, I closed off the post with the following quote.

It has been eight months since the release of the first coding agent, and most people are still unaware of how straightforward it is to build one, how powerful this loop is, and its disruptive implications for our profession.</p><p>So, my name&#39;s Geoffrey Huntley.

The first digital robot chases tool calls.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Sonnet is a robotic squirrel that just wants to do tool calls. It doesn&#39;t spend too much time thinking; it biases towards action, which is what makes it agentic. Sonnet focuses on incrementally obtaining success instead of pondering for minutes per turn before taking action.</p><p>It seems like every day, a new model is introduced to the market, and they&#39;re all competing with one another. But truth be told, they have their specialisations and have carved out their niches. </p><p>The problem is that, unless you&#39;re working with these models at an intimate level, you may not have this level of awareness of the specialisations of the models, which results in consumers just comparing the models on two basic primitives:</p><ol><li>The size of the context window</li><li>The cost</li></ol><p>It&#39;s kind of like looking at a car, whether it has two doors or three doors, whilst ignoring the fact that some vehicles are designed for off-roading, while others are designed for passenger transport. </p><p>To build an agent, the first step is to choose a highly agentic model. That is currently Claude Sonnet, or Kimi K2. </p><p>Now, you might be wondering, &#34;What if you want a higher level of reasoning and checking of work that the incremental squirrel does?&#34;. Ah, that&#39;s simple. You can wire other LLMs in as tools into an existing agentic LLM. This is what we do at Amp.</p><p>We call it the Oracle.

It&#39;s best to think of them as a Commodore 64, and as such, you should be treating it as a computer with a limited amount of memory. The more you allocate, the worse your outcome and performance will be.</p><p>The advertised context window for Sonnet is 200k. However, you don&#39;t get to use all of that because the model needs to allocate memory for the system-level prompt. Then the harness (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Amp) also needs to allocate some additional memory, which means you end up with approximately 176k tokens usable.</p><p>You probably heard a lot about the Model Context Protocols (MCPs). They are the current hot thing, and the easiest way to think about them is as a function with a description allocated to the context window that tells it how to invoke that function.</p><p>A common failure scenario I observe is people installing an excessive number of MCP servers or failing to consider the number of tools exposed by a single MCP tool or the aggregate context window allocation of all tools.</p><p>There is a cardinal rule that is not as well understood as it should be. The more you allocate to a context window, the worse the performance of the context window will be, and your outcomes will deteriorate.</p><p>Avoid excessively allocating to the context window with your agent or through MCP tool consumption. It&#39;s very easy to fall into a trap of allocating an additional 76K of tokens just for MCP tools, which means you only have 100K usable. </p><blockquote>Less is more, folks.

Due to time constraints, we didn&#39;t delve into the notion of the harness prompt. The harness prompt is where your tool registrations go. It contains information such as the operating system you&#39;re running, so it knows whether to use PowerShell (Windows) or bash (Linux or macOS). </p><p>It also contains instructions on how the agent should operate. I say should is because LLMs are non-deterministic. You can include the guidance, and it&#39;s just guidance. However, through prompt evaluation, tuning, and spending time playing with the models to understand how they behave, you can develop effective prompts.</p><p>Drop by the blog post below if you want to see an example of a fully fledged coding agent:</p><figure><a href="https://ghuntley.com/amazon-kiro-source-code/"><div><p>source code analysis of Amazon Kiro</p><p>It’s an uncertain time for our profession, but one thing is certain—things will change.
