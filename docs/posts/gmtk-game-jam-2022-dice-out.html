    <h1>GMTK Game Jam 2022: Dice Out</h1>
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
        <p>I’ve made a game! Well, a small one and in just 48 hours, but still a game.</p>

<p>You can play it in the browser:</p>

<p>Here are my observations.</p>

<h2 id="game-engine">Game engine</h2>

<p>Using a game engine helps a lot. It solves a lot of problems that you don’t want to deal with in 48 hours or, probably, never.</p>

<p>I chose Godot and liked it a lot: Python-like language seems like a better fit for casual scripting than C#, and apparently it has much better HTML export than Unity.</p>

<p>A game engine also gives you a visual editor for many resources you’ll need for a game: tilesets, sprites, animations, levels, and state machines. You don’t want to tune all that in JSON.</p>

<h2 id="game-programming">Game programming</h2>

<p>Game programming is quite different from standard web- or whatever type of programming we do.</p>

<p>In games they prefer ECS over OOP (data and behavior separation, components instead of inheritance), encourage global mutable state, like simple solutions, and dislike abstractions.</p>

<h2 id="art-pipeline">Art pipeline</h2>

<p>Figma feels a great fit for 2D sprites because of the components. In the case of our dice, I designed dots and faces separately and then combined them into dice. When I wanted to tune colors or shapes, I changed them in one place and they updated everywhere.</p>

<figure><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/figma.png" /></figure>

<p>Feels like programming!</p>

<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>

<p>Any game is better with a character. We made a pretty abstract roll-the-dice-in-a-labyrinth game which by itself would be inherently boring:</p>

<figure><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/boring.png" /></figure>

<p>That’s why we introduced Gnargle! Look how he follows the dice with his eyes:</p>

<figure><video autoplay="" muted="true" loop="true" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls=""><source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/fun.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></figure>

<p>Much more lively, isn’t it?</p>

<h2 id="juice">Juice</h2>

<p>Juice are small effects that add the feeling of “impact” to the actions. In the example above, it’s a puff of smoke after the dice, a little jump, screen shake, and dynamic camera position.</p>

<p>Compare it to the version without all that:</p>

<figure><video autoplay="" muted="true" loop="true" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls=""><source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/no_juice.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></figure>

<p>Still functional, but much less fun.</p>

<h2 id="level-design-spoilers">Level design (spoilers!)</h2>

<p>I’m pretty proud of our level design. Each level tries to explore an interesting property that’s inherent to the dice as a mathematical object.</p>

<p>I’m going to go through each level explaining its purpose, so if you want first to experience it yourself, open our <a href="https://tonsky.itch.io/dice-out" target="_blank">Itch.io page</a> and play the game. It shouldn’t take you more than 10-15 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="level-1">Level 1</h3>

<p>A pretty standard tutorial level that explains how the game works and what your goal is:</p>

<figure><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/level1.png" /></figure>

<p>On top of that, it shows that returning dice exactly the same way changes nothing, or that any path is completely reversible.</p>

<h3 id="level-2">Level 2</h3>

<p>Still tutorial, it demonstrates that if you take another path you might get a different result. It also shows that the solution from level 1 won’t work, so you have to adapt:</p>

<figure><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/level2.png" /></figure>

<h3 id="level-3">Level 3</h3>

<p>This teaches an interesting property: rotation around one vertex.</p>

<figure><video autoplay="" muted="true" loop="true" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls=""><source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/level3.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></figure>

<p>Notice how 1 travels from the top left to bottom left to bottom right. That’s because only three faces are touching one vertex which makes a cycle of three (1, 2, and 3 in that case). But there are four tiles on the board, so using this rotation you can move any top-facing face to any of the four squares you want.</p>

<h3 id="level-4">Level 4</h3>

<p>This is pretty much an extended version of level 3, but now, given more than four tiles, you can get faces that weren’t previously possible:</p>

<figure><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/level4.png" /></figure>

<h3 id="level-5">Level 5</h3>

<p>This was supposed to demonstrate that now that you can get any face with 3-by-3 tiles, you can get them anywhere. This is the level how it went to the game:</p>

<figure><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/level5.png" /></figure>

<p>But after the release I thought of a better way to demonstrate the point:</p>

<figure><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/level5_better.png" /></figure>

<h3 id="level-6">Level 6</h3>

<p>This is a tiny aha moment (hopefully). You thought your goal is to move your dice somewhere, but here’s no goal. How come?</p>

<figure><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/level6.png" /></figure>

<p>Of course, because the target tile is under your starting position!</p>

<h3 id="level-7">Level 7</h3>

<p>To be honest, designing puzzles for this wasn’t easy because you can get absolutely anything given 3x3 and almost anything given 2x2, as we’ve explored before.</p>

<figure><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/level7.png" /></figure>

<p>So in this case you don’t get a single 2x2 configuration and instead get a cycle that you need to run multiple times to get the dice in the correct position.</p>

<h3 id="level-8">Level 8</h3>

<p>This is in some sense a re-iteration of level 5, again illustrating that you can pretty much get anything anywhere.</p>

<figure><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/level8.png" /></figure>

<p>The gotcha in this one is, I guess, that an easy-looking tile configuration doesn’t mean the solution will be equally straightforward.</p>

<h3 id="level-9">Level 9</h3>

<p>Finally, level 9, which could be best described with the video:</p>

<figure><video autoplay="" muted="true" loop="true" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls=""><source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/dice-out/level9.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></figure>

<p>Again, this is a non-verbal joke that is communicated entirely through level design.</p>

<p>But beyond that, the missing tile is located so inconveniently that players will (hopefully) figure out a way to predict the value they will get there (which is quite simple, because going in a straight line is a simple 4-cycle).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you liked the game! I for sure had a lot of fun!</p>
