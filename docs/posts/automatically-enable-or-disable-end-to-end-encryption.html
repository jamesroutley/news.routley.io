<p>In general, I&#39;d say the PGP integration is a step forward,  but the design decision that encryption can only be globally enabled or disabled seems, with all due respect, brain dead. For 20 years, I had a very hard time getting non tech savvy users to adopt PGP, and thus when TB announced their built-in support, I was received.  But this is a real bummer, because I know that most users I am interacting with will not think of having to enable encryption for the current message.</p>
<p>One compromise would be that TB, whenever it finds a matching key, it should, prior to sending the message, ask the user whether or not encryption should be enabled.</p>

<p>This is just about attaching the pubkey, not about automatically encrypting when a pubkey for the recipient is available, right?</p>
</div></div><div id="c99"><p>Yes, it&#39;s a totally different issue. I used it as an example to show that there are different/easier options than implementing a full-fledge UI to realize what probably most of those following this issue are looking for: Basically a simple option, to turn on encryption automatically only when there are public keys available for all recipients. Currently there is only on and off. What we need is a third option: &#34;On if there is a known public key for all recipients - otherwise off&#34;. That would solve perhaps not all situations, but would massively alleviate the current problems and disappointment many have after upgrading from the old Thunderbird with Enigmail.</p></div><div id="c100"><div id="ct-100" data-comment-id="15143121" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>(In reply to Magnus Melin [:mkmelin] from <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135636#c96" title="RESOLVED FIXED - Automatically enable or disable end-to-end encryption (OpenPGP or S/MIME) if it&#39;s possible based on existing user and recipient configuration.">comment #96</a>)</p>

<p>This is deplorable, because, even though TB 78 provides the technical underpinnings for making end-to-end encryption easier, this limitation, according to the feedback I get, make it very unlikely for anyone to effectively start using PGP if they haven&#39;t, because they will always just forget to check the box, and for anyone who has been using enigmail in the past, this is a major nuisance. As much as I appreciate that TB is committed to making PGP use more common, I have again downgraded to 68 because of this.</p>
<p>So, this should really get priorised, I feel. Again, I really value the efforts you are making here. I just feel that abolishing Enigmail at this stage was premature.</p>

<p>thanks for your offer to help. I&#39;m not a developer myself, but I&#39;m managing Thunderbird within my organization (80+ staff), advocate for it for 10+ years, and an author of a small TB addon.</p>
<p>I think what gave this bug renewed attention is not only the fact that it is 20 years old, but also the fact that sending unencrypted emails with encryption enabled in TB78+ (still the case in TB91) is more complex than with TB68 and enigmail.</p>
<p>There is are quite some discussions, bugs about this e.g.:</p>
<p>I&#39;m just a person trying to keep my colleagues motivated to continue using encryption, and Thunderbird. The introduction of TB78 severely complicates sending unencrypted emails (which is the majority) while having encryption enabled (some emails per day to certain people, and those emails must be encrypted, so no way to make it optional, as my colleagues will simply forget to check the (hidden) checkbox).</p>
<p>So if you have time, and motivation to help improving the workflow of sending (un)encrypted emails, and it doesn&#39;t have to be this bug, I think there are many other possibilities.</p>
<p>As TB91 is out since a couple of days and it retained the complex workflow of TB78, I fear that any improvement could only come with TB2022 (in one year?).</p>
<p>Some practical examples to improve the workflow in the meantime:</p>
<ol>
<li>an addon/setting which simplifies user-interaction to disable/enable encryption in the composer (right now, the &#34;do not encrypt&#34; button is hidden behind a small arrow - this is already a big obstacle for the majority of users).</li>
<li>an addon/setting which improves the error messages when you miss public keys of recipients (right now, there are 2 popups, and no way to simply click &#34;send unencrypted&#34;)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m sure there is more, these are just my ideas.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

<p>I do wonder why this has been released in the first place. Enigmail has served us really well for many years, it did everything we needed.</p>
<p>For me, convincing any of my peers to use PGP has become not only not easier but more difficult, and the absence of an &#34;encrypt whenever possible&#34; switch is a big part of the problem. Another is that  Thunderbird hasn&#39;t made it easier to exchange keys. This is the greatest showstopper. In any other trusted channels, key exchange happens without user interference in the background. With email this isn&#39;t possible because encryption is tagged on, rather than built in. But Thunderbird could at least work to make it as seamless as possible. But ok, this is for another bug report. Anyway, I hope we don&#39;t have to wait another full year for a fix.</p>

<p>The NSA spends millions of dollars per year specifically to corrupt &#34;security by default&#34; and their biggest enemy is PGP because it uses secure and quantum resistant RSA, so it&#39;s no coincidence that this ticket exists for a &#34;security by default&#34; problem in the most used PGP email implementation.</p>
<p>A similar &#34;security by default&#34; corruption was the multi-million dollar PR campaign to remove DHE from browsers because services started using custom generated parameters, which was replaced by ECC with unexplained fixed parameters and DUAL-EC-DRBG which has been confirmed to have an NSA backdoor.  The internet is littered with government paid articles claiming ECC is more secure when all of the evidence says RSA/DHE is more secure and mathematically 521-bit ECC will be broken by quantum computers years before RSA-2048.</p>
<p>The explanation is an organized infiltration of OSS communities to weaken security standards.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not discussing implementing a feature, my ticket was for an introduced security vulnerability related to an already existing feature which has been merged into this 19 year old &#34;dump ticket&#34; as a duplicate.</p>
<p>I add information related to other intentionally introduced security vulnerabilities because it links them together for future investigations, especially when a big company gets behind the accusation of NIST curves being backdoored, like when Microsoft got behind the accusation of DUAL EC DRBG being backdoored after 7 years of people drawing attention to it just like this.</p>

<p>Explained like this, it seems quite straightforward, but could you at least post a few screen shots with the new desing during the change, so that there is feedback from this community of passionate people before it’s too late again.</p>
<p>You mentioned encryption, but cryptographic signing should be managed the same way. However, encryption without signing shouldn’t be allowed, like other software already do (the reasons are explained here <a href="https://k9mail.app/2017/01/30/OpenPGP-Considerations-Part-II.html" rel="nofollow">https://k9mail.app/2017/01/30/OpenPGP-Considerations-Part-II.html</a>)</p>
<p>I agree that encryption (or even signing) shouldn’t be disabled automatically without the user being able to make a decision. That is a risk indeed.</p>
<p>What will happen with the surrogate openpgp-alias-rules.json as described in bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1644085">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1644085</a> ?</p>
<p>May I let you know that there are instances when the encryption or signing appear or disappear randomly, which should be mended as well: see bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1744835">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1744835</a></p>

<p>About &#34;user in control&#34;: At least a part of the users (already the 81 here - CC-Size of this Bug), want control in that way, that they can say Thunderbird: &#34;Whenever I have the needed Keys, encrypt my messages.&#34; - In their situation, that&#39;s exactly the expected behavior.</p>

<p>I think it is very important that the user knows what will happen on send,</p>
<p>With old Enigmail I remember that I saw the following behavior:</p>

<p>If you think adding an &#34;Encryption if possible&#34; option would require that, I&#39;d much prefer those extra UI elements to not having an &#34;Encryption if possible&#34; option at all. I personally don&#39;t see this as absolutely necessary, since users who select that &#34;Encryption if possible&#34; option have to do so explicitly, and maybe another option would be to show a huge warning sign in the options when doing so, explaining why this is &#34;dangerous&#34;?</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to try this out once it&#39;s there, but I&#39;m sceptical. So far, the missing &#34;Encryption if possible&#34; option has been what has bothered me most since the Thunderbird 78 upgrade that made Enigmail non-working. For me a &#34;It may come back, we just didn&#39;t have the time to implement it yet&#34; perspective was more motivating to wait than &#34;We don&#39;t want to have it back&#34;. So personally, I&#39;m at least considering to try out alternative email clients (like KMail, which has a &#34;Encrypt whenever encryption is possible&#34;) in the meantime as well.</p>

<p>They say what is good for us users and what we don&#39;t want you to allow stupid users to do.</p>
<p>Your arguments (on safety) and ours (on usage) are both correct.</p>
<p>The point is that everyone has to decide for themselves. It&#39;s like a corona vaccination. Everyone can decide for themselves. But for that there has to be an option.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Install the option and, if in doubt, knowingly activate it via about: Config and everyone would be very happy. Bissel maybe even build in more configuration options -&gt; everyone can do it as they want. If you hack the Thunderbird settings, you will be able to read the email even after it is decrypted.

<p>I think it is very important that the user knows what will happen on send,</p>
<p>With old Enigmail I remember that I saw the following behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>I started to compose an email, and typed the first recipient.</li>
<li>I saw that the user interface showed the icon for &#34;encryption on&#34;,</li>
<li>I typed the email</li>
<li>I added another recipient</li>
<li>I didn&#39;t look at the message status agin, I was convinced that encryption</li>
<li>However, I didn&#39;t have a key for the other recipient</li>
<li>When I hit send, the message was sent without encryption,</li>
</ul>

<p>The old Enigmail, has an option, to show confirmation dialoge windows with info: send OpenPGP/S-MIME + signed/not signed + encrypted/unencrypted - Do you want to send ?</p>

<p>This is basically the plan for how it will work yes (with a notification bar, not confirm dialog). Like Kai wrote, we hope that the implementation will be easy/clear enough that there is no need for automatics. Yes, it will be one click more for some situations. I think that is a reasonable weigh-off though.</p>

<p>It would be great if encryption settings during composing would be available via an API, so a &#34;encrypt if possible&#34; would be an option after all via an addon. BTW: protonmail silently sends encrypted/unencrypted messages with one click of the send-button, with not even a warning. I&#39;m not agreeing with this behaviour myself, but it may give an indication how much one of the more secure email providers (I would say) compromises security in favor of workflow/usability.</p>

<p>Not only my privacy. Privacy of my teams.</p>
<p>Most of our external contact do not use pgp. My Teamates are awesome but most of them won&#39;t accept or bother to click on 80 percent of their mail to acknowledge that it won&#39;t be encrypted.</p>
<p>In UX point of view the implementation you want to set up add a quasi systematic click. Which add a huge usage cost on one of the primary feature of a mail client, in fact it double it as we pass from a simple click to 2 in most cases. I&#39;m pretty sure it won&#39;t help to democratize pgp feature.</p>
<p>In my case I send around fifty mail a day. around 30 can&#39;t be ciphered. With your implementation it means it add 30 popup and 30 click to do what I want. If you look at KMAIL it propose different behavior from automatic to ask anytime, letsencrypt extension let you do the same.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I&#39;m nobody to say that you should implement it this way or another. I&#39;m just saying for my philosophy and usage the orientation of Thunderbird is not the good one for my personal use. I&#39;m pretty sure that not even 1% of the user use pgp en half of them don&#39;t bother to understand how it to work and pick up a random mail provider such as protonMail.</p>
<p>Beside the usage cost. I think Mail client nowadays should focus on democratizing privacy technology. Democratization come with easiness not difficulties. Ones again it&#39;s just a personal opinion from a simple user..</p>

<p>Thanks, for the explanation, and for everyone&#39;s effort to discuss it and their attempt at improvement.</p>
<p>I find the solution you propose acceptable.</p>
<p>Silently encrypting only to a subset of recipients but not others is not a sound practice, leading to a false sense of security, because the same message which is believed to warrant encryption will still be sent on the wire unencrypted, thus defying the aim of encryption. The message is -- generally -- the determinant here, not the recipient.</p>
<p>It could be argued that each recipient&#39;s threat analysis could dictate different choices in regard to encryption, even when the message is the same, for example when one recipient is in political/legal environment where certain communications could criminalise them but not the sender or other recipients. However, approaching the complexity of cases such as these can be left to supplementary implementations, i.e. extensions, the likes of which did exist for previous versions of Thunderbird/Enigmail. So the proper thing to ask for here is a good API that would allow others to build such more complex and customisable functionality on top of this most likely use-case.</p>

<p>You are right, sorry for my little rant. It was just the most obvious point in the linked article and the one that raged me a bit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] there is absolutely no logical or cryptological reason to send encrypted email without signing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated above, I disagree. - Signing and encryption are measures to reach different security goals.</p>
<p>The primary security property reached by encryption is confidentiality. The primary security property reached with asymetric signatures is non-repudiation.</p>
<p>In the article they neglect the possibility of plausible deniability by making assumptions about the environment. While these assumptions are an option to decide which default settings to choose, this is imho no valid option when deciding which things to allow at all, because they are what they are - assumptions. And assumptions could, but don&#39;t have to be true - especially not always.</p>

Why can&#39;t the developers acknowledge that there are use cases where &#34;encrypt if possible&#34; is the desired and needed option.

If you want to avoid user errors, have a clear indicator next to the &#34;To&#34; field with the status of the email encryption with green and red colours. At the moment it&#39;s &#34;hidden away&#34; grey on grey in the far right corner of the status bar.</p>
<p>Other email clients/plugins like K-9 Mail, PGP4Win (GPGOL) and Thunderbird &lt;78 have the option to auto encrypt. Have a read how K-9 handles it.</p>

<p>If you think &#34;encrypt if possible&#34; is unsafe, just don&#39;t use that option for yourself. But don&#39;t make this decision for other users. If you wish, hide that option from the average user or have a big warning sign next to it.</p>
<p>If you stand by your decision, most users who use TB with encryption will have only 2 options, either stay with TB 68 or use another email client.</p>
<p>Let me know write about my use case which worked for many years until you broke it in two ways. I administer an office with about 20 users. All emails between these users should be encrypted. External emails are usually not encrypted, apart from emails to the accountant. I, as admin, set up all keys for the users and store all public keys in a read-only share. When the user logs in, all public keys get imported into the user&#39;s key ring. This way new keys will get populated automatically without user intervention.  Now you broke this workflow too by using your own key store without providing tools to automatically import new public keys. All users know that all internal email is encrypted by default. Now I can&#39;t use this option anymore without requiring a degree in computer science from my users.</p>

<p>Well, only in theory. Currently TB forgets the sign settings and it can send email the wrong way without user notice: see the case study in bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1744835%E2%80%83It">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1744835 It</a> happened to me that unsigned email was sent several times in spite of the identity requiring it. In this regard the automatic signature joins the current debate: if your settings require a signature, but it can’t be provided, then the user should be warned as well and offered to remedy it.</p>

<p>I can understand the developers latest decision from a fundamentalist point of view. However, on the long term, it won&#39;t benefit proliferation of e2e encryption in emails -- and thus I can understand why some think this is intentional, given the hassles of operating encryption in TB in recent versions. (I still find myself checking in the options menu and do up to four clicks to select the correct encryption setting... I know there are two rather unimposing icons in the status bar but never got used to look there first as this would be an additional step. It really would help me if the send button had a green padlock or certificate icon.)</p>
<p>I&#39;m extremely unhappy with the situation a.t.m. and I&#39;m curious about the planned GUI and how it will work out for me.</p>
<p>If this is really about space, remove the security button and move it left next to the send button, naming it &#39;send encrypted&#39; (maybe with a drop-down &#39;send encrypted and unsigned&#39; + &#39;unencrypted but signed&#39;) and show it only if encryption is possible.

<p>&#34;Unencrypted quote-reply to encrypted message&#34; is a separate issue. Replies to encrypted messages MUST be encrypted by default regardless of whether a global &#34;encrypt where possible&#34; feature is implemented.</p>
<p>I propose a compromise: that the encrypted/unencrypted state change should be asymmetric. If an MUA decides that encryption is possible, it MAY enable encryption without prompting the user, so long as it indicates this state change clearly in the UI. If the MUA later decides (e.g. if another recipient has been added) that encryption will no longer be possible, it MUST prompt the user to choose a resolution. This way, upgrades are smooth and downgrades are noisy.</p>

Imagine, one day your favorite e2e encrypted chat messenger starts to expect you to activate encryption for each message. This is, what Thunderbird feels like since the upgrade and this won&#39;t change, until it works without that click.</p>
<p>It worked perfectly fine with enigmail for years. Neither I nor the people I taught mail encryption had any serious problems. I can&#39;t remember to send or receive any accidentally unencrypted mail ever. If you had higher security requirements, it was easily possible to choose the &#34;always encrypt&#34; option, so you could be really sure that no information is leaked. This could still be the default setting to reach your goal of security by default, even if &#34;encrypt if possible&#34; is offered as another choice. With regards to that I don&#39;t get the &#34;we want the user to be in control&#34; part to be honest. I think, there&#39;s a reasonably save way to implement &#34;encrypt if possible&#34;, which does neither violate the user expectations nor put them at risk. At the risk of repeating, what others brought up so far and essentially describing, how enigmail worked - with some tweaks - I want to address your concerns on the basis of the former working solution.</p>
<p>With respect to the distinction of the indicators for &#34;want/can encrypt&#34; i differentiate between &#34;want encrypt&#34; and &#34;will encrypt&#34;:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &#34;<strong>want</strong>&#34; state could be determined once in the settings as default (maybe offered as wizard on first keypair generation and maybe additionally overwritable per mail in the current dropdown), which frames the user expectation with the choices
<ul>
<li>No encryption</li>
<li>Encrypt if possible</li>
<li>Force encryption</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The &#34;<strong>will</strong>&#34; state - indicating if it will be effectively encrypted (<em>on</em>) or not (<em>off</em>) - should be placed as prominent indicator icon with intuitive feedback (like green/red). It should be possible to check the state with one glance before sending and to be sure, that the indicated action will be performed. Clicking on this indicator will switch between forced encrypted (<em>on</em> state) or forced unencrypted (<em>off</em> state) sending (so there is no way back to <em>encrypt if possible</em>, which is ok, as user interaction means, that some behavior should be enforced). Maybe some additional Icon hint could be added to see, if the choice is made automatically, which would vanish on the first manual interaction (like a star in the corner or a border color). On mouseover, additional information could be provided, why some state was chosen (&#34;manually switched on/off&#34;, &#34;key for X missing/expired/revoked&#34;). To address your concerns about missing the state change, when the recipient list is changed, an Icon/Color/Bordercolor could be added to the recipient itself. Another way to mitigate this would be an optional additional dialog to confirm the state, as enigmail offered it with a checkbox in the settings to activate the confirmation. In my experience the dialog is not needed, if the indicator is good enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>There would be no need to place another <em>want</em> indicator on a prominent place, as</p>
<ul>
<li>users with <em>No encryption</em> setting don&#39;t expect mails to be encrypted, but could turn it on for each mail via the <em>will</em> indicator</li>
<li>users with <em>Encrypt if possible</em> setting expect it to work out of the box, can check the effective state with a glance, and can enforce encryption on demand with one click  (this would be the same user effort and outcome as in your current plans) or deactivate encryption with two clicks on the <em>will</em> indicator</li>
<li>users with <em>Force encryption</em> setting expect all mails to be encrypted, but could turn it off for each mail via the <em>will</em> indicator</li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing your further remarks about breaking the user expectation, there are two cases which should be handled differently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New mail</strong> / <strong>Reply to unencrypted mail</strong> (upgrading to encryption should never hurt)
<ul>
<li>No encryption: Nothing to do</li>
<li>Encrypt if possible
<ul>
<li><em>On recipient change</em>: Update <em>will</em> indicator (maybe recipient indicator), <em>on</em> if keys exist for all recipient emails, <em>off</em> otherwise</li>
<li><em>On send</em>: Provide resolution path if some key is expired/revoked, send encrypted mail otherwise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Force encryption:
<ul>
<li><em>On send</em>: Provide resolution path if some key is missing/expired/revoked, send encrypted mail otherwise</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reply to encrypted mail</strong>: Never downgrade to unencrypted. Provide resolution path, if some key is missing/expired/revoked, send encrypted mail otherwise</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>resolution path</strong> could include the options:</p>
<ul>
<li>try an update of the key via WKD / PKI</li>
<li>choose a key manually for each missing/expired/revoked key (a big enhancement here would be instructions, what to to - in my experience key expiration is the most confusing part for non-technical users some years after the workshop)</li>
<li>send unencrypted</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as i can tell, all of your concerns should be addressed with this approach. People with higher security standards could keep the default <em>force encryption</em> setting. The user expectations for the <em>encrypt if possible</em> are met in a save way, as replies to encrypted mails and all mails to recipients with expired/revoked keys never downgrade silently but lead to one general resolution dialog instead (where it could be sent unencrypted with one click). It would work perfectly well with your current plans of one prominent indicator and resolution path without additional UI changes. Am I missing something?</p>
<p>I also want to emphasize, that simplicity is the key to scale mail e2e encryption beyond the group of technical experienced people and firmly believe, that the option <em>encrypt if possible</em> will do way more good than harm. Please reconsider your decision and enable the user to choose a mostly frictionless encryption mode, which already has proven to work for years.</p>

<p>Doing proper security is first having a proper threat model (= what are the most likely attackers and flaws). A good part of this issue at stake seems to revolve around the fact that threat models appear to be wrong.</p>
<p>1/ The idea of never sending both encrypted and unencrypted relies on the hypothesis of an omniscient attacker, like a powerful state spying on people. It&#39;s a common scenario, but far from the only one. Your company, tech-savvy revengeful roommate, local restaurant with poor Wifi+poor server TLS... there are many credible scenarios without an omniscient attacker. If your recipient with encryption is the only possible victim amongst other recipients, it makes sense to still send it (now it gets trickier in multi-party discussions, but for a one-time send esp. Bcc the point is obvious) . In fact, <em>even if you don&#39;t know who are the most likely victims</em>, it still makes more sense to encrypt some than to encrypt none, statistically. Not to mention, of course, getting e2ee to the general public.</p>
<p>2/ The idea of never sending unsigned encrypted messages is a good one in theory, but relies on the hypothesis of an active attacker (= that can modify content). Same as previous point : it&#39;s common, but far from the only one. There are many (more) passive attacks, and if you consider the ergonomy problems we&#39;re having regarding encryption, you know you WILL find yourself in situations where you NEED to send an email immediately, but have no private key on the current computer for some reason. Better to send it encrypted than not encrypted at all : for all you know, the attacker may not be more than passive, and you can still confirm with your recipient via other channel that it&#39;s unsigned. STILL better than unencrypted.</p>
<p>There definitely IS value in not having all settings at mandatory maximum security all the time. All I&#39;m saying is &#34;false sense of security&#34; can&#39;t be an excuse for everything. <strong>Case in point</strong> : it has lead to less security.</p>
<p><strong>As for the GUI</strong> : it seems to me the encryption state (encrypted, signed, both or none) in the context of encrypt-if-possible CAN be displayed per recipient easily, in the autocomplete field. Look at how Vuetify does it : <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/autocompletes/#item-and-selection" rel="nofollow">https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/autocompletes/#item-and-selection</a></p>
<p>You shouldn&#39;t shy away from using colors, icons, and maybe tooltip for a full user help.</p>
<p>(Sorry I didn&#39;t mean to teach you security, more like get the point across for all participants)</p>
</div></div><div id="c185"><p>If I may reformulate : you need a better UI to dissipate the false sense of security &amp; clarify the situtation before sending, not block the feature (nor hide it behind dialogs).

So anyone <em>will</em> end up going &#34;never encrypted&#34; and then forget to encrypt.</p>
<p>Thus it is a regression from the former behaviour of Thunderbird (with Enigmail), even though I acknowledge the fact the latter was not perfect, however it worked better <em>on average</em>. To want a UI experience 100% perfect, you need to overhaul everything, I understand, but meanwhile you&#39;ll have thousands of people <em>deactivating</em> encryption because it is too much a hassle.</p>
<p>This regression is equivalent to put up a new notification after an upgrade that reads “now encryption is very difficult to use, would you like us to deactivate it for you?”</p>

</div></div><div id="c199"><div id="ct-199" data-comment-id="15986201" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>In the meantime we have released Thunderbird 102, which has the improvements that were previously announced.</p>
<p>Despite that, I understand that this doesn&#39;t yet address the request of this bug, which asks for fullly automated enabling or disabling of encryption.</p>
<p>I would like to make an attempt to offer this functionality, I have an experimental patch that I would like to offer for testing, and I&#39;m interested in feedback.</p>
<p>To enable the functionality, in account settings, besides the choices to enable or disable encryption for new message, the experimental patch adds a new third choice, which offers to automatically enable or disable encryption.</p>
<p>The thoughts behind the experimental implementation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user must be able to see on screen what will happen at the time the message will sent (prior to clicking the &#34;send&#34; button)</li>
<li>no prompts (the user shouldn&#39;t be required to perform any choice)</li>
<li>ensure the user can notice if encryption is automatically disabled</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is my primary concern of any solution that we consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>The user composes an email, and enters one initial email address.</li>
<li>We can encrypt, we automatically enable encryption. We show status in the UI that encryption is enabled.</li>
<li>The user notices that encryption is enabled, makes a mental note that it is enabled, and feels safe about typing sensitive information.</li>
<li>The user prepares the email, writes all the text, and the user is almost ready to send it.</li>
<li>In the last minute, the user decides to add another recipient. But we cannot encrypt to that recipient.</li>
<li>Because the user is in automatic mode, we automatically disable encryption.</li>
<li>However, the user might not notice that we automatically disabled encryption</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very important to me that we&#39;d use an implementation that strongly makes the user aware, whenever encryption was previously enabled, but Thunderbird decides to automatically disable encryption (because it isn&#39;t possible, and because of the configured mode to automatically decide).</p>
<p>WIth the experimental patch that I&#39;m providing, a warning notification will be shown on screen, in bright yellow, which says &#34;End to end encryption was automatically disabled, because you cannot encrypt to at least one recipient.&#34;</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>is this warning sufficient to address my concern? For users who had previously noticed that encryption was automatically turned on (visualized by the changing state of the encryption toolbar button), can we assume that this notification is sufficient for those users to realize that encryption turned off again?</li>
<li>can everyone asking for the full automatic behavior tolerate this notification?</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div id="c200"><p>(If you were reading this from the email notification, please read the updated comment in bugzilla, I&#39;ve fixed a few typos/mistakes.)</p></div><div id="c202"><div id="ct-202" data-comment-id="15986218" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>I like your approach in principle. I would just add that if a warning message is displayed, it should always be as specific as possible. “You cannot encrypt to at least one recipient” is good, but vague. “You cannot encrypt to the following recipients: &lt;foo&gt; &lt;bar&gt;” is much better. Warning messages that could have supplied more information but didn&#39;t are one of my pet hates. ;-) If there is too much detail to display at once, hide it under a dropdown or a link, but still make it available for those who really want it.</p>
<p>As a further enhancement, you could have hot buttons for remediation actions, e.g. &#34;remove these recipients&#34; or &#34;send without encryption&#34;, and refuse to send until the user explicitly picks one. This might be too intrusive for most though, so should probably be opt-in (and doesn&#39;t have to be addressed right away).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If there are many, the list can get long. We already have a way to communicate problematic recipients.</p>
<p>If the user explicitly enables encryption (either because that&#39;s the default setting for new messages, or because the user has explicitly clicked the &#34;encrypt&#34; toolbar button in an individal message), then we already give visual feedback about the encryption-incompatible recipients: We show the problematic email addresses with highlighting color.</p>
<p>But we do so, because in &#34;requested encryption&#34; mode, those really are causing a problem - cannot send encrypted.</p>
<p>Please remember that we&#39;re talking about this new mode, when the user has explicitly stated they simply want it to be handled automatically. If the user has said they want it to be automatically decided, then why should we highlight what the problematic recipients are? They are no problematic recipients in automatic mode, because we can send without encryption.</p>
<p>My impression is, the request for an automatic mode is &#34;don&#39;t bother me if encryption isn&#39;t possible&#34;. And highlighting problematic recipients, whether it&#39;s with a color, or listing them in a text message, could be considered as too much bothering. The user might still get the impression that something is wrong and must be fixed. But in automatic mode, there is no need to fix anything.</p>
<p>I see three scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user really doesn&#39;t care, then the user will be ok with not encrypting, and doesn&#39;t need the information what&#39;s causing the non-encryption</li>
<li>the user really wants to encrypt. In that case, the user should override the automatic decision and click the encryption button to require it. And that, already today in the production 102 version, will give the user the feedback you&#39;re asking for. Thunderbird will highlight all recipients that are problematic, will display a summary, and will offer to open a key assistant, which will show in detail which users are problematic, and will even attempt to assist the user to resolve this situation</li>
<li>the user doesn&#39;t think encryption is necessary, but the user is simply curious to learn what&#39;s causing the problem. In this scenario, I&#39;d prefer to avoid that we have to introduce an additional mechanism to give this feedback to the user, I&#39;d prefer to reuse the feedback described above. If the user is curious, they can enable encryption, look at the state, and if they decide they don&#39;t want to encrypt, they can manually turn it off again.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in order to fulfil your request, we&#39;d have to make the user aware of the above approach that can be used to see the list of problematic users.</p>
<p>Maybe this could be achieved by using a different notification message, like:</p>

<p>If sending to two recepients, and to one can be encrypted and to the other not, will in automatic mode the mail to the encrypt-possible recipient be encrypted but to the other recipient sent in plain text, or will be sent to both in plain text?

<p>Yes, and these are great for must-encrypt mode, as they clearly indicate problems that must be addressed. But do you intend that these will also be used in opportunistic-encryption mode? If so, they seem visually too strong for what we&#39;re talking about here, as they imply an error rather than a warning. Or do you mean a similar kind of notification with different (less urgent) styling?</p>
<p>If we want to remain consistent with the To: field notifications, maybe a better idea would be to highlight (subtly) which recipients <em>can</em> be encrypted to, rather than those which can&#39;t. This way, the user would still get visual feedback but in a much less intrusive manner. These could even be displayed regardless of the opportunistic-encryption setting (a gentle reminder of what is possible, rather than what is impossible).</p>
</div></div><div id="c206"><div id="ct-206" data-comment-id="15986442" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>After thinking about it a bit more, there are four classes of recipient in a 2x2 matrix of &#34;encryption possible&#34; (i.e. valid key available) vs &#34;encryption required&#34;. It is no longer possible to set &#34;encryption required&#34; per recipient, but the concept is still useful when thinking about visual cues in the (must|may|don&#39;t) encrypt operation modes.</p>
<p>If encryption is impossible but required, then the current yellow warnings are perfect. If encryption is impossible but not required, then the default styling is appropriate. Considering the other two possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>If encryption is possible but not required, then perhaps a subtle decoration (e.g. a lock badge) could be added to the name, similar to the address-book dot (and with a similar tooltip explanation).</li>
<li>If encryption is possible and required, then should the default styling be used (since no action need be taken), or something distinct (as a visual confirmation)?</li>
</ul>
<p>One big caveat is that putting a lock symbol of any kind in the To: field has a variety of possible (mis)interpretations. But relying solely on colours raises accessibility concerns.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m convinced that a message must be sent consistently. Either encrypt to everyone, or not encrypt to anyone.</p>
<p>If a recipient receives an encrypted message, and the client shows that the message is encrypted, the recipient should be safely able to conclude that the message content traveled with encryption to everyone.</p>

<p>Yes, and these are great for must-encrypt mode, as they clearly indicate problems that must be addressed. But do you intend that these will also be used in opportunistic-encryption mode? If so, they seem visually too strong for what we&#39;re talking about here, as they imply an error rather than a warning. Or do you mean a similar kind of notification with different (less urgent) styling?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. If encryption is optional, I do NOT want highlighting of missing-key-recipients, to avoid that the user perceives them as problematic/blocking. (They aren&#39;t in optional/automatic mode.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we want to remain consistent with the To: field notifications, maybe a better idea would be to highlight (subtly) which recipients <em>can</em> be encrypted to, rather than those which can&#39;t. This way, the user would still get visual feedback but in a much less intrusive manner. These could even be displayed regardless of the opportunistic-encryption setting (a gentle reminder of what is possible, rather than what is impossible).</p>

<p>As you say, there&#39;s the risk of misinterpretation. The user could falsely conclude that recipient-shown-with-lock means that the message WILL be encrypted to that recipient.</p>
<p>I think we shouldn&#39;t overload the UI. If the user wants that information, they can get it. FYI, I didn&#39;t mention this yet, but another way to get this information is by opening the &#34;Key Assistant&#34; from the OpenPGP/SMIME toolbar button, it will explain exactly what you have and what is missing.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never noticed such a &#34;dot&#34; and cannot even find it now. I think such subtle notifications cannot be understood (or even noticed) without a clear explanation.</p>
<p>However, what I&#39;m learning from your feedback, you really want some kind of feedback, that immediately answers the question &#34;WHO are the recipients that caused automatic encryption to get disabled?&#34;.</p>
<p>The solution that would require the least amount of new work, and reuse as much of what we already have, would be like this:</p>
<p>&#34;Automatic End-to-end encryption was disabled, because you cannot encrypt to at least one recipient. [Learn More...]&#34;</p>
<p>If the user clicks the &#34;Learn More&#34; button, we bring up the &#34;Key Assistant&#34; popup (the same one that you can access at any time from the toolbar button). That dialog already explains it in detail, and provides assistance, if desired.</p>

<p>No. Automatically disabling encryption without the user’s agreement is a bad idea, especially if you received the message encrypted. You take the responsibility of divulging it in spite of the sender putting trust in you. It can’t be the developer’s “fault”.</p>
<p>I totally agree with Kai’s experienced point of view: in case of an impossible automatic decision, the user should be the decision maker. Since the automatic mode is enabled, it’s not preposterous that the user knows encryption is still working and they can do something about improving the situation (like deciding to not send, but find the PGP key before another action or whatever they decide).</p>
<p>As with your home, no matter what kind of doors and keys you have, you still see your doors and windows; and sometimes there is something that makes that they don’t work properly.</p>

<p>It depends on what goals and assumptions you are making.</p>

<p>The majority of Thunderbird&#39;s encryption thinking is following the minimizing harm strategy.</p>

<p>This is the only correct approach. Consider the following scenario:</p>
<p>Alice sends an encrypted message to Bob. Mallory cannot read or modify the encrypted message body in transit, but may be able to modify the headers. If Mallory were to (say) add a Reply-to: header so that replies were directed to an address visually similar to Alice’s, Bob may inadvertently reply to that address instead, and is likely to quote-include Alice’s original plaintext. Silently disabling encryption for yhe reply enables a downgrade attack on Alice’s original message, regardless of Alice’s encryption preferences.</p>
<p>There are ways to mitigate this attack (signed headers etc) but there are no circumstances in which silent downgrades in the middle of conversation threads are desitable, so they should be made impossible in principle.</p>
<p>The same considerations also apply to forwarded messages, so the same downgrade protections should be enforced there also.</p>

<p>While we&#39;re waiting for test feedback, let me continue here with more general comments.</p>
<p>I would like to update the bug subject to make it more obvious that this ticket is NOT about opportunistic encryption.</p>
<p>Once we have that &#34;automation&#34; ability, we need to offer the ability to the user.</p>
<p>Currently, the initial experimental implementation in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1795981" title="NEW - Collect feedback on an experimental implementation for encrypt-if-possible (bug 135636)">bug 1795981</a> offers that through hidden preferences, only.</p>
<p>One option is to start with this limitation. Only offer it through hidden prefs, and allow interested parties (like you) to start experimenting with it, and identify bugs.</p>
<p>In a second step, we could eventually offer discoverable preferences in the standard Thunderbird settings.</p>
<p>An important question for that is:</p>
<p>In other words - do you think users might want this automation for their first email account, but not for their second email account?</p>
<p>(And we&#39;d need to make a decision. If we think that some users need different configuration per account, and we want to offer that flexibility, then it would be a per-account configuration for everyone.)</p>
<p>In a third step, we could consider to advertise this &#34;automation&#34; ability to the user, and make it easy to enable it.</p>
<p>For example, we have recently introduced reminder notifications, that can remind the user that encryption is possible.</p>
<p>Likewise, currently we have a notification if encryption is already enabled, but NOT possible. (This currently offers the choices &#34;disable encryption&#34; and &#34;resolve&#34; for OpenPGP, only.)</p>
<p>As explained further above, the current suggestion is, whenever we automatically disable encryption (after it was already enabled), we inform the user - in the initial experiment implemented using a prompt. This prompt could offer a checkbox for the third pref &#34;never notify me when encryption is automatically disabled&#34;.</p>
<p>If we decided to have those interactive ways to enable the prefs, here&#39;s a worry: If we make those prefs per-account, then users might be confused why in emails for another account those actions are not happening automatically.</p>
<p>To avoid this potential confusion we could make the prefs global (same automation configuration for all email accounts).</p>
<p>I would like to limit this bug to the &#34;first step&#34; that I described above, and start with hidden prefs for the initial implementation.</p>
<p>I would like to file follow-up bugs for step 2 (user visible configuration) and step 3 (interactively assist the user to enable encryption automation).</p>
<p>After, or in parallel to steps 2 and 3, we could also discuss if it makes sense to change the defaults (e.g. use the automation to enable encryption by default).</p>
<p>I&#39;ll file yet another bug to track the default decision.</p>
<p>So, we&#39;re still at step 1.

        Attachment description: WIP: Bug 135636 - Implement automatic enabling and disabling of encryption (still experimental). → Bug 135636 - Implement automatic enabling and disabling of encryption (turned off by default). r=mkmelin</p></div></div><div id="c239"><div id="ct-239" data-comment-id="16329032" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>I&#39;ve marked the attached patch for review, I think it&#39;s ready for landing it (pending code review).</p>
<p>I suggest to initially keep the functionality disabled by default, and require the user to explicitly turn it on.</p>
<p>Following is a description of the current behavior.</p>
<pre><code>If the new feature is enabled,
  (global pref: mail.e2ee.auto_enable)
AND
the user has configured end-to-end encryption for themselves,
AND
  the user has already received/obtained valid S/MIME certificates
  for ALL recipients of an email the user is composing,
  OR
  the user already has obtained valid OpenPGP public keys
  for ALL recipients of an email the user is composing,
  and the user has already marked all required public keys
  as accepted,
only then:
  The mail composer UI will automatically turn on
  end-to-end encryption for this message,
  and automatically select the technology that is usable,
  OpenPGP or S/MIME.
</code></pre>
<p>This should make it clear that this is NOT &#34;opportunistic encryption&#34;.</p>
<p>For other users, who do NOT have the new pref enabled,</p>
<p>If the user then makes further modifications to the list of email</p>
<p>There&#39;s an additional new pref to influence that scenario:</p>
<p>If the user has both auto_enable and auto_disable set to true,</p>
<p>(The pref mail.e2ee.auto_disable has no effect if the user has manually turned</p>
<p>Automatically disabling has the following risk:</p>
<p>The user might have started composing the email,</p>
<p>To prevent this fatal mistake, based on not having paid</p>
<p>A third pref mail.e2ee.notify_on_auto_disable can be used to disable this notification.</p>
<p>As a reminder of existing behavior: We already enable encryption automatically,</p>
<p>Besides changing the list of recipients, there&#39;s another action that could</p>
<p>Depending on the configuration state of the identities (e2ee is activated in account settings, or isn&#39;t),</p>
<p>Here is one related change, which ALL e2ee users will get, even if the new</p>
<p>If the user has manually enabled encryption for the message, or we&#39;re replying</p>
<p>When saving a draft, we&#39;ll remember whether the user has manually enabled</p>
<p>If encryption was explicitly enabled by the user (or automatically enabled because</p>
<p>Here is a visible change that users will get who have the new auto_enable pref turned on:</p>
<p>Today, in e2ee account settings, we have the following old pref:</p>
<p>&#34;Default settings for sending messages&#34; with choices &#34;disable&#34; or &#34;enable encryption for new messages&#34;.</p>
<p>This pref makes no sense when turning on the global new pref &#34;mail.e2ee.auto_enable&#34;.</p>
<p>With the new code, if auto_enable is turned on, that pref will be hidden from the UI.</p>
<p>Instead, at the same position in the pref UI, the following explanation text will be shown:</p>
<p>&#34;Encryption will be automatically enabled, based on available recipient keys or certificates. You may override the automatic decision.&#34;</p>
<p>If, in addition, the pref auto_disable is turned on, too, then the following, slightly different text will be shown:</p>
<p>&#34;Encryption will be automatically enabled or disabled, based on available recipient keys or certificates. You may override the automatic decision.&#34;</p>
<p>If you wish to try the current state of this work yourself, there are test builds here:</p>

<p>I&#39;ve commented in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1675737" title="NEW - OpenPGP and S/MIME: Preferred encryption technology, automatic selection is not yet implemented">bug 1675737</a>, which is a duplicate of <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1806328" title="RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Switching encryption technology should change when switching sender identity based on its preference">bug 1806328</a>.</p>
<p>The current patch of this <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135636" title="RESOLVED FIXED - Automatically enable or disable end-to-end encryption (OpenPGP or S/MIME) if it&#39;s possible based on existing user and recipient configuration.">bug 135636</a> uses the technology preference configuration to automatically switch to the configured preferred technology, if encryption is possible with two technologies, and a preferred technology is configured.</p>
<p>However, the current patch will switch technology if only one technology can be used with encryption. Maybe that&#39;s wrong. Maybe we should never automatically switch to the non-preferred technology.</p>
<p>We can handle that in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1675737" title="NEW - OpenPGP and S/MIME: Preferred encryption technology, automatic selection is not yet implemented">bug 1675737</a>, but preferably after the work here has completed, because of likely code overlap. (The fix will also have to handle the scenario, where the new auto_enable pref is set to false.)</p>
