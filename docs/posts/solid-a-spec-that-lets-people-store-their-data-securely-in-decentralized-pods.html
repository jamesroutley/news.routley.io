              <b>Solid</b> is a 
              <a href="https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol">specification</a> 
              that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores 
              called <b>Pods</b>. Pods are like secure personal web servers for 
              data. When data is stored in someone&#39;s Pod, they control which 
              people and applications can access it.

            <p>
              
              Any kind of data can be stored in a Solid Pod, from structured
              data to regular files that you might store in a Google Drive
              or Dropbox folder. People can
              grant or revoke access to any slice of their
              data as needed.

            <p>
              All data in a Solid Pod is stored and accessed using standard, 
              open, and <b>interoperable data formats and protocols</b>. 
              Solid uses a common, shared way of describing things
              and their relationships to one another that
              different applications can understand. This gives
              Solid the unique ability to allow different applications to
              work with the same data.

            <h2>Share it safely</h2>
            <p>
              Anyone or anything that accesses data in a Solid Pod uses a 
              unique ID, authenticated by a decentralized extension of OpenID 
              Connect. Solid&#39;s access control system uses these IDs to 
              determine whether a person or application has access to a 
              resource in a Pod.

        Data stored in Solid Pods can power ecosystems of
        interoperable applications where individuals are free to use their data 
        seamlessly across different applications and services.</p>
