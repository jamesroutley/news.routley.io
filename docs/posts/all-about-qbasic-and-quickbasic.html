      <h3>QBasic / QuickBASIC - an excellent Introduction in programming for Beginners</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Best way to learn programming is to start with a lightweight programming language and a simple compiler.
        <strong>Qbasic</strong> (short: QB) has great advantages for pros and beginners that other compilers can&#39;t offer:</p>
        <h4>Helpful on typing proper Code</h4>
        <p>Code is checked for errors while typing; each expression will be evaluated immediately after typing.
        By the way, this extraordinary feature is an important reason for the great popularity of QB: the ability to check expressions while typing.
        This saves a tremendous amount of time when checking the code, in particular for large projects; just because a comma is missing somewhere.</p>
        <h4>QBasic with modern Windows OS&#39;s</h4>
        <p>Back then, when DOS was the most widely used operating system, QB IDE enjoyed great popularity.
        On current Windows systems, QBasic / QuickBASIC requires a DOS emulator, e.g. <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1"><b>DOSBox</b></a>.</p>
        <h4>Some more Features</h4>
        <p>No installation necessary, QBasic / <b>QuickBASIC</b> is portable and does&#39;t affect the systemâ€™s registry.
        When launching QB, a command line window opens that displays a couple of menus with access to standard functions such as editing, searching and debugging, just to name a few.
        Qbasic is ideally suited to all users, from beginners to experts; it&#39;s an impressive code interpreter including a powerful IDE.</p>
