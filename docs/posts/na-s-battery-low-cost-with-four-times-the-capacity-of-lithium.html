			<p>Led by <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/shenlong-zhao.html">Dr Shenlong Zhao</a> from the University’s <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-chemical-and-biomolecular-engineering.html">School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering</a>, the battery has been made using sodium-sulphur – a type of molten salt that can be processed from sea water – costing much less to produce than lithium-ion.</p>
<p>Although sodium-sulphur (Na-S) batteries have existed for more than half a century, they have been an inferior alternative and their widespread use has been limited by low energy capacity and short life cycles.</p>
<p>Dr Zhao’s Na-S battery has been specifically designed to provide a high-performing solution for large renewable energy storage systems, such as electrical grids, while significantly reducing operational costs.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://assets.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/documents/resources/reports/clean-energy-australia/clean-energy-australia-report-2022.pdf">Clean Energy Council</a>, in 2021 32.5 percent of Australia’s electricity came from clean energy sources and the industry is accelerating. Household energy storage is also growing. According to a recent <a href="https://www.sunwiz.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SunWiz-Australian-Battery-Market-2021-Purchasers_Redacted.pdf">report</a> a record 33,000 batteries were installed in 2021.</p>
<p>“Our sodium battery has the potential to dramatically reduce costs while providing four times as much storage capacity. This is a significant breakthrough for renewable energy development which, although reduces costs in the long term, has had several financial barriers to entry,” said lead researcher Dr Zhao.</p>
<p>“We hope that by providing a technology that reduces costs we can sooner reach a clean energy horizon. It probably goes without saying but the faster we can decarbonise -- the better chances we have of capping warming.</p>
<p>“Storage solutions that are manufactured using plentiful resources like sodium – which can be processed from sea water – also have the potential to guarantee greater energy security more broadly and allow more countries to join the shift towards decarbonisation.”</p>
