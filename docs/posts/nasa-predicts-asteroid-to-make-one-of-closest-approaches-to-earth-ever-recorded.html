    <h1>NASA predicts asteroid to make one of closest approaches to Earth ever recorded</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p data-block-key="7un8c">On Thursday, Jan. 26, a small near-Earth asteroid will have a very close encounter with our planet. Designated 2023 BU, the asteroid will zoom over the southern tip of South America at about 4:27 p.m. PST (7:27 p.m. EST) only 2,200 miles (3,600 kilometers) above the planet’s surface and well within the orbit of geosynchronous satellites.</p><p data-block-key="ct0g5">There is no risk of the asteroid impacting Earth. But even if it did, this small asteroid – estimated to be 11.5 to 28 feet (3.5 to 8.5 meters) across – would turn into a fireball and largely disintegrate harmlessly in the atmosphere, with some of the bigger debris potentially falling as small meteorites.</p><p data-block-key="6ug72">The asteroid was discovered by amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, discoverer of the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newly-discovered-comet-is-likely-interstellar-visitor">interstellar comet</a> 2I/Borisov, from his MARGO observatory in Nauchnyi, Crimea, on Saturday, Jan. 21. Additional observations were reported to the Minor Planet Center (<a href="https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/">MPC</a>) – the internationally recognized clearinghouse for the position measurements of small celestial bodies – and the data was then automatically posted to the <a href="https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/NEO/toconfirm_tabular.html">Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page</a>. After sufficient observations were collected, the MPC <a href="https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/mpec/K23/K23B72.html">announced the discovery</a>. Within three days, a number of observatories around the world had made dozens of observations, helping astronomers better refine 2023 BU’s orbit.</p></div></div></div></div>
