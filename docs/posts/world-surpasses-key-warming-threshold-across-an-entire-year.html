If passed, tipping points can lead to dramatic shifts or <a href="https://blog.metoffice.gov.uk/2023/09/11/what-do-we-mean-by-a-climate-tipping-point/" target="_blank">potentially irreversible changes</a> to some of Earth&#39;s largest systems.</p><p>Matt Patterson, a postdoctoral research assistant in atmospheric physics at the University of Oxford, described the findings of C3S as a &#34;significant milestone,&#34; but cautioned that they do not mean the Paris Agreement has failed.</p><p>&#34;A single year above the 1.5C threshold is not enough to breach the Paris climate agreement as the agreement concerns temperatures averaged over 20 to 30 years,&#34; Patterson said.</p><p>&#34;However, exceeding 1.5C in one year underlines the rapidly shrinking window of time humanity has to make deep emissions cuts and avoid dangerous climate change.&#34;</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107370643" data-test="InlineImage"><div><div><p>A farmstead is seen in a valley with little snow near Prags, Italy, on February 6, 2024.</p><p>Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div><p>The U.N. notes that the world has already warmed by <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/mythbusters" target="_blank">around 1.1 degrees Celsius</a>, fueling a series of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/04/south-america-argentina-and-chile-gripped-by-extreme-mid-winter-heat.html">extreme weather events</a> around the world.</p><p>Brian Hoskins, chair of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, said the C3S findings were a &#34;stark warning of the urgency for the action that is required to limit climate change at anything like the Paris targets.&#34;</p></div></div></div>
