    <h1>Questions about construction trucks on train tracks</h1>
    
    
<p>
Another day, another bit of local flavor, but this time it's something I 
wish I didn't have to write about.
</p><p>
In August 2012, I
<a href="/w/2012/08/26/caltrain/">wrote</a>
about seeing a maintenance truck rolling down the Caltrain line in 
Mountain View.  It had a special attachment to let it stay on the rails.  
At no point did the arms come down for the crossing.  It managed to 
approach, then the people inside looked around and went through, and the 
arms never budged.  There were no flashing lights or bells.
</p><p>
Based on my understanding of how those crossings work, that says 
"whatever holds that truck to the rails does not manage to connect them 
in whatever way that a train does to trigger the crossing arms".
</p><p>

</p><p>
This is not great.  Then today happened.  Earlier this morning, Caltrain 
hit *two* different trucks on the rails north of Millbrae.  Then it 
<em>caught fire</em>.  A bunch of people were hurt.  More were shaken 
up.
</p><p>
These weren't random trucks from some random idiots gallavanting up and 
down the lines.  These were their own construction trucks which have 
been working to install overhead power for the future electric trains.
</p><p>
I'm assuming their construction trucks don't trigger the "short the 
rails together to signal various things" logic, either.  This would 
mean that crossing arms stay up... and I have to assume it also means 
the signals along the way stay green instead of going red.
</p><p>
We will presumably hear more about whatever the signals said, and 
whether the train went past a red signal or not.  I just have a bad 
feeling that they saw a green and kept on going.
