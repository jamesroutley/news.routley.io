    <h1>Ask HN: Why are there no open source NVMe-native key value stores in 2023?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi HN,
NVMe disks, when addressed natively in userland, offer massive performance improvements compared to other forms of persistent storage. However, in spite of the existence of projects like SPDK and SplinterDB, there don&#39;t seem to be any open source, non-embedded key value stores or DBs out in the wild yet.</p><p>Why do you think that is? Are there possibly other projects out there that I&#39;m not familiar with?</p></div></div></div>
