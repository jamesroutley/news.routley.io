    <h1>Driver hack lets you run Linux after Windows BSODs, no reboot required</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>Normally, a blue screen of death crash (BSOD) in Windows would cause your PC to automatically restart, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/NSG650/BugCheck2Linux" data-url="https://github.com/NSG650/BugCheck2Linux">programmer NSG650</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUsfSQPrqrM&#39;" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUsfSQPrqrM&#39;">NTDEV</a>) has created a driver that instead makes your PC boot up a Linux emulator. While this driver is more of a novelty than it is actually useful, it&#39;s an ingenious showcase of how to exploit features in software by simply using them in an unintended way.</p><p>The way this driver works is actually pretty simple — it just uses the built-in bug check callback feature in Windows. A bug check is just the technical name for a crash or BSOD, and when a bug check happens, Windows wants to know why. As part of the bug check callback routine, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/drivers" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/drivers">drivers</a> can &#34;reset a device to a known state,&#34; per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=tomshardware-us-7045992698224310000&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows-hardware%2Fdrivers%2Fkernel%2Fwriting-a-bug-check-callback-routine" data-url="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/writing-a-bug-check-callback-routine" target="_blank" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows-hardware%2Fdrivers%2Fkernel%2Fwriting-a-bug-check-callback-routine" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="microsoft.com" data-merchant-id="1855" data-merchant-url="microsoft.com" data-merchant-network="LS">Microsoft&#39;s Windows coding handbook</a>. In other words, it can still run code after a crash.</p><div data-nosnippet=""><p><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XUsfSQPrqrM" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>While most drivers would use this opportunity to add diagnostic data to the crash dump file, NSG650&#39;s driver inserts a RISC-V Linux emulator, which might be a slight misuse of the bug check callback function in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a>&#39;s eyes. To be clear, this is not to be confused with a PC with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/dual-boot-linux-and-windows-11" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/dual-boot-linux-and-windows-11">dual booting</a>, which means it has both Windows and Linux installed.</p><p>You won&#39;t be able to do much in this emulator because it&#39;s basically just DOS or a command line operating system rather than something fully fleshed out like Ubuntu or Arch Linux. You can&#39;t even backspace if you make a typo, and you have to use caps lock instead of shift to capitalize; that&#39;s how limited this emulator is.</p><p>However, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima" data-url="https://github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima">RISC-V Linux emulator</a> is incredibly tiny and only clocks in at 400 lines of code. By contrast, the full Linux kernel alone has millions of lines. It would seem that either it wasn&#39;t possible to run a full Linux distro, or it was simply too much of a hassle to get it to work, which would be a fair reason given that this isn&#39;t something anyone is likely to seriously use.</p><p>While this driver is more or less just a funny joke about Windows and Linux, it does bring up the possibility of doing more with the same bug check callback feature. It&#39;s not clear what you can and can&#39;t do, but if it&#39;s possible to run an emulator after crashing, then surely it&#39;s possible to do other things, too. That&#39;s all assuming Microsoft doesn&#39;t revisit this feature of Windows and concludes it&#39;s just a bit too easy to exploit.</p>
