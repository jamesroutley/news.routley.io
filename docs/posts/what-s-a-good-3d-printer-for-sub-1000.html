    <h1>Ask HN: What&#39;s a good 3D Printer for sub $1000?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>At least a 256x256x256mm print volume. Needs to be enclosed or enclosable. Need to be able to print with more durable, temperature/chemical resistant materials such as PC/Nylon/ABS or infused materials. I do not need to print multi material models. I would prefer something that doesn&#39;t phone home and can work offline. Opensource firmware/software and repairability are important.</p><p>I am ok assembling the machine and learning how to dial it in. I can do CAD work and make models by hand; I was a machinist in a past life. But, I am not very familiar with &#39;slicer&#39; software yet.</p></div></div></div>
