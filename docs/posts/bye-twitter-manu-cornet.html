<p>2022.11.01</p>




<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>I hereafter relate the facts from my point of view, but the interpretation is
speculation and educated guesses.</p>

<h2 id="short-version">Short version</h2>

<p>Since I was one of the early layoffs after the Oct 2022 acquisition of Twitter,
some people have been curious about the reasons. My current understanding is that I was too much of a potential troublemaker for the new management.</p>

<h2 id="main-story">Main story</h2>

<h3 id="most-likely-direct-reason">Most likely direct reason</h3>

<p>After the layoff rumors, many Twitter employees wanted
to save some important documents before potentially losing access.
For example: statements from their stock broker (company goes
private ‚Äì&gt; no more stock, which can be a big part of compensation),
things from WorkDay (outsourcedd HR management), etc. This may also include
emails important to one‚Äôs future career if considered from a self-protection standpoint (good
performance reviews, proof of key achievements, etc.). Think about it: if you
thought you may lose access to all your work email tomorrow,
is there <em>anything</em> in there that you may need?</p>

<p>Earlier, I had made for myself a tiny browser extension. All it did was to
automatically do this on a single conversation:
<img src="https://ma.nu/blog/img/2022-11-01_bye_twitter/gmail_download.gif" alt=""/>
That‚Äôs it. (This is only relevant if your company uses ‚ÄúGoogle Workspace‚Äù,
which includes Gmail, and if your administrator has disabled IMAP access.)</p>

<p>Was this a violation of a corporate policy? Not unless it could be proven that
the downloaded message file was moved away from the corporate computer. I had
been learning from my years at Google (working on Gmail, heh)
where an ‚Äúemail retention policy‚Äù was implemented to auto-delete emails older
than 18 months.</p>

<p>On 1À¢·µó Nov 2022 I decided to help out other concerned employees by
publishing this extension on the Chrome Web store
(<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmail-message-downloader/dpginnmbipdjncnfgbnnbemhjfpmnolm">here it is</a> ‚Äî and
<a href="https://ma.nu/blog/img/2022-11-01_bye_twitter/gmail_downloader_extension_page.png">here is a screenshot</a>
in case it ever gets taken down). I then posted a link to the extension on an
internal Slack channel. On the same day, I was fired and that post was taken down.</p>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The extension does something that anybody can do manually without it.</li>
  <li>Google approved the extension onto its store (manual process).</li>
  <li>The immediate reason for the firing is in essence my wanting
to help others by sharing a tool I had been using myself for a while.</li>
  <li>I wasn‚Äôt asked to take the extension down before termination.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="poor-performance-unlikely">Poor performance: unlikely</h3>

<p>I hope those never come or remain minimal, but the ‚Äúpoor performance‚Äù layoffs
haven‚Äôt started yet. Prior to my termination I had volunteered
to work on some newly urgent changes and worked through the weekend (slept on
a couch at the office on Sat evening), and on Monday (Oct 31) was brought over to three
‚Äúsecret‚Äù
and high priority projects. In the various ‚Äústack-ranking‚Äù lists to (naively) compare engineers, I was in the top 5 or 10%.</p>

<h3 id="better-explanation">Better explanation</h3>

<p>A couple of people much smarter than me have suggested that
that this may be an excuse to fire me over a ‚Äútroublemaker‚Äù vibe coming from me.
I don‚Äôt deny that, and I don‚Äôt blame
the new management for preferring not to have to deal with that liability. More
history on this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In Oct 2021, Twitter HR had asked me to take down a cartoon I
had posted. I took down the internal post, but I took issue with the fact that
they also asked me to take down my public Twitter post (which should have been outside
of their authority). The then-CEO Jack Dorsey had sent me a very
short question about that:
<img src="https://ma.nu/blog/img/2022-11-01_bye_twitter/jack_message.jpg" alt=""/>
All such cartoons have been public since then, <a href="https://twittoons.com">on this site</a>).</li>
  <li>In July 2022, as I had been sharing some broad statistics (tenure, location) about
Twitter employees
(all internally, and made from data accessible to anyone internally), I got some amount of scrutiny
from HR. I toned it down but didn‚Äôt stop updating my existing pages.</li>
  <li>In Oct 2022, as Elon Musk was visiting the San Francisco office, I made a
printed version of <a href="https://twittoons.com/22">this cartoon</a> with a short inscription and handed it to him:
<img src="https://ma.nu/blog/img/2022-11-01_bye_twitter/elon_note.jpg" alt=""/>
(He took the print and said ‚ÄúWell I bought it anyway‚Äù, replying to the line in
the cartoon).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>I am doing fine. I am very lucky: I have citizenship of another country with
good health insurance, I have a green card, I am fine financially (that may have
allowed me to speak up more than others). I don‚Äôt
hold any grudges against people who were just doing their job when confronted
with a naive and mildly idealistic troublemaker like me, and I loved my time at
Twitter, especially my coworkers. üíô</p>

<h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>

<p>Adding questions as I get them. Questions not answered here? Drop me a direct message <a href="https://twitter.com/lmanul">on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What exactly did they say to you?</strong></p>

<p>A: Just this email (hiding names as it came from someone I actually quite like (still): <img src="https://ma.nu/blog/img/2022-11-01_bye_twitter/termination_email.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>My reply: ‚ÄúThanks [redacted]! I‚Äôd love to know what ‚Äúrecent behavior‚Äù is, but let me
know if someone else can provide more context. Regardless, it was a pleasure working with you :-) @[Redacted] I assume I can ask you about off-boarding instructions? I have
this big expensive Twitter-provided Mac laptop that I‚Äôd love to return
properly. I‚Äôm near the SF office, is there an easy way for me to
return it in person? That would avoid expensive FedEx-ing fees :-D
Thanks!‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Q: What do you mean by stack-ranking engineers? What were the criteria?</strong></p>

<p>A: Raw number of lines of code over a certain period (a year I think).</p>

<p><strong>Q: Which cartoon were you asked to take down?</strong></p>

<p>A: It was <a href="https://twittoons.com/4">episode number 4</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Will you get a severance package?</strong></p>

<p>A: I doubt it.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are you going to fight this?</strong></p>

<p>A: Maaaaaaybe? But likely not. Yes, I know that‚Äôs what they want. I have
better things to do :-D</p>

<p><strong>Q: Will you keep making cartoons? About Twitter? About Google again? About other things, too?</strong></p>

<p>A: Yes, yes, yes and yes. :-)</p>

<p><strong>Q: What‚Äôs next for you?</strong></p>

<p>A: I don‚Äôt know yet. I might do drawings (and other creative and unlucrative endeavours)
full time. Or I might try to go back to work at Google if they‚Äôll have me back.
I am extremely lucky not to be under any pressure.</p>

<!--
* Was thinking about leaving, but they were faster
* Others less lucky. Financial safety means I could speak up more. I have
  health insurance. But not painting myself as a knight, still just silly cartoons.
* Not really anything against Musk. Right-leaning okay, but otherwise, sound
  business. Overpaid. And doesn't take himself too seriously.
* Not gonna plug. Ukraine, Iran, Pakistan. Climate.
