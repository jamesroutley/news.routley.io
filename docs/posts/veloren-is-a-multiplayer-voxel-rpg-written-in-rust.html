    <p>
      Veloren is a multiplayer voxel RPG written in Rust. It is inspired by games such
      as Cube World, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Dwarf Fortress and
      Minecraft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Veloren is fully open-source, licensed under GPL 3. It uses original graphics,
      musics and other assets created by its community. Being contributor-driven, its
      development community and user community is one and the same: developers,
      players, artists and musicians come together to develop the game.

      developers working on the game, with another 20 artists, writers, designers, and
      composers contributing as well. Over 150 people have contributed to the
      project. Veloren currently has builds for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
