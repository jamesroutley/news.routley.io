    <h1>Indie Hackers is indie again</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="ember255270">    <p>Exactly six years ago (to the day!), Stripe acquired Indie Hackers to help us grow and inspire millions of people building online businesses.</p>
<p>Today, I&#39;m happy to announce that <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/channingallen">@channingallen</a> and I are indie hackers again!</p>
<p>Specifically, this means we&#39;re back to running Indie Hackers as a standalone business, owned by the founders. Although we&#39;re no longer part of Stripe, Stripe continues to be supportive of IH as an investor to help us get going.</p>
<p>This has been about four months in the making. Branching out on our own is something we mutually decided on with Stripe, and we&#39;re excited about it!</p>
<p>It goes without saying that I&#39;m incredibly grateful for Stripe&#39;s belief and support of Indie Hackers over the years. It still blows my mind that <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/patrickc">@patrickc</a> reached out and took a chance on us when we were just a tiny bootstrapped company ourselves, that we were able to run freely and autonomously despite being part of a much bigger company, and that we now have the chance to own Indie Hackers again. Stripe couldn&#39;t have handled things any better, and I want to personally thank <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/patrickc">@patrickc</a> and everyone else at Stripe for their support through the years.</p>
<p>So what now?</p>
<p>Well, if we want to survive and thrive, we&#39;re going to have to generate revenue just like any other business! I&#39;m an entrepreneur at heart and always have been. In fact, working at Stripe was my first and only salaried job.</p>
<p>Right now we&#39;re sitting at exactly $0 in MRR, so the journey is just now (re)starting.</p>
<p>I&#39;m fired up!!! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥</p>
