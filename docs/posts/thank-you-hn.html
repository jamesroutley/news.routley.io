      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Thank you HN and particularly YCombinator, admins and its founders. I found YCombinator at the age of 18-19 when I was going through my own way, I started my Bachelors university studies 4 years before I graduated from school, Computer Science has been my curiosity field ever since and YCombinator has had always fresh news, interesting content and startups (I found about it at the time through Daniel Gross who&#39;s at my age). I gave up on people on other forums such SOF, FB, LinkedIn and reddit, I&#39;ve come across your forums for the first time just now and they are such sane, it&#39;s so pleasant to read your content. I&#39;d not known about any place to be able to talk to any place with other people like me besides traveling to US to YCombinator startup combinator, and I like my job and now when I found this forum it feel such a warm place (I found it while looking for information about dbus) and it feels like I finally can talk to people who are just like me and write posts and post comments like THIS without being threatened. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!! Mr. Graham, founders, admins you rock!!!! &lt;3 ^_^ :)</td></tr>
