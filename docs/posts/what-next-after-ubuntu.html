    <h1>Ask HN: What Next After Ubuntu?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have been running Ubuntu on servers and desktops for around twenty years, but ongoing changes to their platform have shaken my faith in its future. The first serious breach of trust was forcing their users to use their untrustable snaps (e.g. Firefox on 22.04), but the last straw for me has been breaking apt upgrades on 20.04 LTS in order to push their Pro agenda.</p><p>I am looking to replace Ubuntu with something that will be stable and supported for the next twenty years, without being ruined by corporate interests.  What are my best options?</p></div></div></div>
