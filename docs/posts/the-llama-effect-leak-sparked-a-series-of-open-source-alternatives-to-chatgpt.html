In the text-to-image domain, the release of Stable Diffusion clearly signaled that open source was a viable distribution mechanism for foundational models. However, the same cannot be said in the large language model (LLM) space, in which the biggest breakthroughs are coming from models like GPT-4, Claude, and Cohere, which are only available via APIs. The open source alternatives to these models haven’t shown the same level of performance, specifically in their ability to follow human instructions. However, an unexpected research breakthrough and a leaked release are starting to change that.</p><p>A few weeks ago, Meta AI announced Llama, an LLM designed to advance research in the space. Llama was released in different versions, including 7B, 13B, 33B, and 65B parameters, and despite being notoriously smaller than alternative models, was able to match the performance of GPT-3 across many tasks. Llama was not initially open-sourced, but a week after its release, the model was leaked on 4chan, sparking thousands of downloads.</p><p><span>What could have been seen as an unfortunate incident has become one of the most interesting sources of innovation in the LLM space in the last few weeks. Since the leak of Llama, we have seen an explosion of innovation in LLM agents built on it. Just to cite a few examples:</span><a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html" rel="">Stanford University released Alpaca</a><span>, an instruction following model based on LLama 7B model.</span></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://vicuna.lmsys.org/" rel="">Researchers from  UC Berkeley, CMU, Stanford, and UC San Diego open sourced Vicuna</a><span>, a fine-tuned version of LLama that matches GPT-4 performance.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2023/04/03/koala/" rel="">Berkeley AI Research Institute(BAIR) released Koala</a><span>, a version of LLama fine-tuned using internet dialogs.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebullvm/tree/main/apps/accelerate/chatllama" rel="">Nebuly open sourced ChatLLama</a><span>, a framework for creating conversational assistants using your own data.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://freedomgpt.com/" rel="">FreedomGPT is an open source conversational agent</a><span> based on Alpaca which is based on LLama.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://medium.com/@yangyou_berkeley/colossalchat-an-open-source-solution-for-cloning-chatgpt-with-a-complete-rlhf-pipeline-5edf08fb538b" rel="">The Colossal-AI project from UC Berkeley released ColossalChat</a><span>, a ChatGPT type model with a complete RLHF pipeline based on LLama.</span></p></li></ul><p>Several other projects are worth mentioning in this list, and I am sure more will be released soon. One thing is certain: the accidental leak of Llama might have turned out to be one of the biggest sparks of innovation in the open source LLM space.</p><p><strong>OpenAI Safety</strong></p><p><span>OpenAI published a detailed blog post outlining some of the principles used to ensure safety in their models.
