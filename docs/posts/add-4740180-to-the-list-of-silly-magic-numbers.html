    <h1>Add 4740180 to the list of silly magic numbers</h1>
    
    
<p>
Oh dear.  The software fungus where bits of code take the
<a href="/w/2016/02/21/malloc/">literal characters "HTTP" as a number</a>
has expanded.  Now it has a variant: 4740180.
</p><p>
What's that?  4740180 is 0x485454... that's "HTT".
</p><p>
Where does this one come from?  
<a href="https://kennethjenkins.net/posts/go-nginx-grpc/">Go and gRPC, apparently!</a>
</p><p>
Again, it comes down to "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request" being parsed as part 
of some binary protocol.
</p><p>
I found this while searching the web for "1213486160" to see how things 
have been going in the past few years.  Unfortunately, it's still biting 
people all over the place.  There are far too many posts asking people 
to upgrade their software, or restart things, or do any number of 
useless rubber-chicken-waving techniques which ultimately will 
accomplish nothing.
</p><p>
When you see a funny-looking number, figure out where it comes from.
That's the only way to have any chance of understanding what's actually 
going on.
