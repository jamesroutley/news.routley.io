But, of course, any time a new app launches it’s impossible to predict exactly how audiences will respond.

The problem stems from the CEO’s efforts earlier this month to be the trendy “</span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTREdBgmd/" rel="">cool mom</a><span>” rather than address the company’s underlying issues. </span></p><p><span>I don’t claim to be a PR pro but there is an existing framework that brands can consult when they become </span><strong>TikTok’</strong><span>s character of the day, so let’s get into it so I can exorcise this from my timeline.</span></p><p><strong>What’s Happening:</strong><span> Tarte was accused of bias. Again. This time surrounding their influencer trips to the Turks and Caicos and Miami’s Formula 1 race. </span><strong><a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/icymi/2023/05/tarte-cosmetics-miami-f1-influencer-trip-drama-explained" rel="">Rolling Stone</a></strong><span> and </span><strong><a href="https://time.com/6279894/tarte-brand-trips-influencer-marketing/" rel="">Time</a></strong><span> both did excellent explainer pieces, detailing how the brand failed creators of color earlier this month — whether it was assigning them smaller rooms or staggering their visits so that they weren’t included in key activities. The incidents appeared to be part of a broader pattern of inadequate representation within the company which extended from the leadership team to their employees and the creators invited on coveted brand trips.</span></p><p><strong>Remember When:</strong><span> Tarte’s </span><a href="https://liahaberman.substack.com/p/tartes-influencer-trip-what-they" rel="">Dubai trip</a><span> earlier this year also drew criticism for the significant lack of diversity among the influencers included (valid) and for accusations of being economically tone deaf (not as valid, IMO, since every brand has a different marketing mix and no one seems to be criticizing other companies on how they spend their marketing budgets).</span></p><p><strong>In Case of Emergency:</strong><span> When shit hits the fan, there’s a framework brands can use to determine whether a situation constitutes unwarranted criticism or a legitimate crisis they need to address.</span></p><ol><li><p>Is there a noticeable shift in online sentiment or conversation?</p></li><li><p>Could this situation have a material or legal impact on the company overall?</p></li></ol><p><strong>Why We’re Still Talking About This:</strong><span> Given Tarte’s </span><a href="https://youtu.be/4cXsgT3ZcL8" rel="">prior track record</a><span>, the minute the claims of “second-tier” treatment surfaced online, CEO </span><strong>Maureen Kelly</strong><span> should not have recorded a light hearted, and now-deleted, GRWM (get ready with me) TikTok video minimizing the complaint and chalking it up to a miscommunication. Responding defensively and dismissively to the immediate complaint and not grasping that it was a symptom of a larger company issue became the story.</span></p><p><span>It’s now been almost three weeks and the recaps, breakdowns, and explainer content continue on TikTok and </span><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/everything-know-backlash-against-tarte-162541762.html" rel="">in the media</a><span>.     </span></p><p><span>In the meantime, Tarte has posted a </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/director-of-diversity-equity-inclusion-at-tarte-cosmetics-3601576216/" rel="">job</a><span> on </span><strong>LinkedIn</strong><span> for a Director of Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion position — ​​not to make a problem go away, but rather to “start conversations that can lead to a better solution,” Kelly told </span><strong><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/tarte-cosmetics-ceo-apology-pledge-diversity-equity-inclusion-rcna83735" rel="">NBC News</a></strong><span>. </span></p><p><span>However, that’s sharply at odds with concurrent actions of the company and its CEO in blocking online critics (like </span><strong><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRKKTwMc/" rel="">@CultureWork</a></strong><span> and </span><strong><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRKERtf4/" rel="">@SaraJMcCord</a></strong><span>) on TikTok. Tarte might not appreciate their cultural commentary but it’s valid criticism. Ignore it if you want to, but don’t block them as if they’re trolls, especially if you’re claiming that open conversations are part of your solution. That’s just throwing gas on a raging fire.</span></p><p><span>Instead, </span><strong>acknowledge</strong><span> your mistake; </span><strong>apologize</strong><span> sincerely; and take genuine </span><strong>action</strong><span> on corrective measures. </span></p><p><strong>Related</strong><span>: Tarte was actually crushing it in April, according to </span><strong>Creator IQ:</strong><span> </span><strong>Tribe Dynamics</strong><span>’ EMV (Earned Media Value) report of </span><a href="https://21030792.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21030792/TTT%20April%202023.pdf?__hstc=7639341.aead13c1560ac8a3ed064c0a0ee08068.1684443644703.1684443644703.1684443644703.1&amp;__hssc=7639341.2.1684443644703&amp;__hsfp=1223513178" rel="">Beauty and Fashion Brand Rankings</a><span> — making it into the top 10 EMV cosmetics brands. And that number hasn’t dropped. Yet.</span></p><p><span> “Usually, if an event is truly perceived negatively, you’ll see a drop in conversations from the creators as they don’t want to be associated with the brand,” </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Conor_Begley_/status/1658826913115443200" rel="">tweeted</a><span> Creator IQ CSO </span><strong>Conor Begley</strong><span>.
