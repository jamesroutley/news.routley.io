    <h1>Womens Sizing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--[--><p><!---->To highlight the median body proportions of the adult women in the U.S., we relied on anthropometric reference data for children and adults that is regularly released by the National Center for Health Statistics within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.<!----></p><p><!---->For this story, we pulled data on the median waistline circumference of women and girls that was <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/174595">gathered between 2021-2023</a>. For girls and women under 20 years old, measurements were recorded in two-year age ranges (ex: 10–11 years, 14–15 years), with a median of 141 participants per age range. For women over 20, measurements were recorded in nine-year age ranges (ex: 20–29 years, 30–39 years) and collectively for all women 20 and older. Each nine-year age range had a median of 465 participants. Overall, measurements were recorded for 3,121 women ages 20 and older.  Those who were pregnant were excluded from the data.<!----></p><p><!---->HHS also provides a breakdown of measurements within set percentiles for each age range, which includes figures for the 5th, 10th, 15th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 85th, 90th, and 95th percentiles. We then used that percentile data to extrapolate the waistline measurements of all women and girls within each respective age group.<!----></p><p><!---->We also compared figures to those recorded by HHS from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_11/sr11_249.pdf">1988-1994</a>. There, 7,410 women ages 20 and older participated in the study. Measurements were originally recorded in centimeters, so we converted to inches.<!----></p><p><!---->Brands included in the size chart comparisons represent a diverse cross-section of popular apparel brands and retailers in the U.S., including a mix of mass market, fast fashion, premium and luxury labels.<!----></p><p><!---->For each brand, we focused on collecting body measurements for “regular” or “standard” size ranges, as well as “plus” sizes when available. Sizing information for “petite,” “tall,” or “curve” clothing lines were not included. Size charts reflect the body measurements for garments categorized as general “apparel.” In a select few cases where that category was unavailable, “dresses” were used as the default garment type.<!----></p><p><!---->Within each size range, we focused on collecting three main body measurements: Bust, waist, and hip. Some were presented as a range from minimum to maximum values, while others were single measurements. All numeric U.S. women’s sizing labels and descriptions were recorded, as well as their corresponding alpha sizes, when available.<!----></p><p><!---->Size chart data was last manually captured in July 2025 and may not reflect a brand’s current size chart. Brands frequently change their size charts, and more often than not, shoppers aren’t even aware when measurements or sizes are updated.<!----></p><p><!---->The standardized size charts refer to ASTM International’s regular release of its Standard Table of Measurements for Adult Female Misses Figure Type. The 1995 release (designated as D 5585-95) reflects sizes 2-20. ASTM updated its standards in 2021 (designated as <a href="https://store.astm.org/d5585-21.html">D5585-21</a>) to include sizes 00-20.<!----></p><p><!---->Ransom note letters are from <a href="https://indieground.net/product/ransom-note-letters/">Indieground.</a><!----></p><!--]--></div></div>
