<p>&#34;This will be an important supplement to our already existing network of air filter stations in Norway, and particularly important for nuclear preparedness in the North,&#34; says Markus Ottosen, section leader for the High North at the DSA.</p><p>&#34;The stations are used to monitor radioactivity in the air, and to assess the size and composition in the event of possible accidents and incidents,&#34; Ottosen continues.</p><p>The relevant station near Ny-Ålesund has been in operation since 2000.</p><p>The DSA also has access to data from a similar station on Platåfjellet outside Longyearbyen. This is operated by the research institute NORSAR on behalf of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization.</p></div>
