        <p>In the early 20th century, the British <a href="https://mollybrown.org/history-of-the-white-star-line/">White Star Line</a> set out to make the largest and most luxurious ocean liners the world had ever seen. Between <a href="https://www.history.com/articles/titanic-facts-construction-passengers-sinking-discovery">1909</a> and 1914, the shipping line built a trio of upscale vessels: the <em><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Olympic">Olympic</a></em>, the<em> <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/tag/titanic/">Titanic</a></em> and the <em><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Britannic">Britannic</a></em>.</p>

<p>Within a decade of the <em>Olympic</em>’s maiden voyage in June 1911, two of the three sister vessels had met tragic ends: the<em> Titanic</em>, which <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/after-the-titanic-sank-families-and-friends-of-people-on-the-ship-anxiously-waited-to-see-who-survived-and-who-perished-180984989/">famously sank</a> after striking an <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/this-historic-photograph-may-depict-iceberg-that-sank-the-titanic-180984255/">iceberg</a> in April 1912, and the lesser-known <em><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/100-years-ago-today-titanics-sister-ship-became-casualty-world-war-i-180961167/">Britannic</a></em>, which sank in November 1916 after hitting a naval mine in the Aegean Sea during World War I.</p><div>

Some of <a href="https://archives.novascotia.ca/titanic/list/">the bodies</a> were buried at sea, while others were brought back to land.
    </p></div>
</div><p>This week, Greece’s Ministry of Culture <a href="https://www.facebook.com/culturegr/posts/pfbid0LpCb8Nsd9kjZ64mmhUmcetyrrD7s7ovuwGkm2qk9KnVozqbRBtg9kcYvDNQg2MRPl?ref=embed_post">announced</a> that deep-sea divers have recovered artifacts from the wreck of the <em>Britannic </em>for the very first time. The finds include the ship’s bell, a pair of binoculars and a navigation lamp.</p>

<p>In May, an 11-member team embarked on a weeklong expedition to the wreck site, which rests at a depth of nearly 400 feet, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/britannic-titanic-shipwreck-recovery-9a525f9831bc0d67c1c9604cc7155765">Associated Press</a> reports. The highly skilled group of divers used closed-circuit <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/question632.htm">rebreather equipment</a> to safely survey the ship. “Conditions at the wreck site were particularly challenging due to currents, depth and low visibility,” the ministry says in a <a href="https://www.culture.gov.gr/el/Information/SitePages/view.aspx?nID=5451&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawM2adZleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFySlExVU8zYmRMV0hlUDViAR74MOb7P8vftLIaWm2YEk5yCvCamob-WvpEdZlQ6NZIhx5oggbCSTAJJQQ0RA_aem_6KC9KREPS7sxc3dLW7CC-A#prettyPhoto">statement</a>, per a translation by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/15/objects-retrieved-hmhs-britannic-wreck-titanic-sister-ship-greece">Agence France-Presse</a>.</p>

</figure><p>British historian Simon Mills, who <a href="https://thehistorypress.co.uk/article/qa-with-simon-mills-owner-of-the-hmhs-britannic-wreck/">purchased the wreck</a> in 1996, organized the recovery operation. Artifacts raised from the depths include both practical objects and luxury items, like silver-plated trays used in first class, ceramic tiles from a Turkish bath, and a porcelain sink from the ship’s second-class cabins.</p>

<p>The items are currently undergoing conservation in Athens. Afterward, they will be prominently displayed at the National Museum of Underwater Antiquities, which is <a href="https://www.greece-is.com/maritime-legacy-reborn-greeces-new-underwater-antiquities-museum/">slated to open</a> in Greece’s largest port city, Piraeus, in 2026.</p>

<p>Unlike the <em>Titanic </em>and the <em>Olympic</em>, the <em>Britannic </em>was never actually deployed as a luxury cruise liner. Instead, the vessel was requisitioned in 1915, operating as the largest hospital ship in the world for almost a year. As Mills explains <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/discover/articles/interviews/shipwrecks-like-the-britannic-are-inevitably-living-on-borrowed-time/">in an interview</a> with Bloombsbury:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the time the <em>Britannic</em>’s keel was being laid, the <em>Titanic</em> was still several months from completion, and the <em>Olympic </em>had been in commercial service for almost six months, but the building and operational experience gained by observing the earlier vessels meant that even at this early stage, there would have been countless improvements incorporated into the <em>Britannic</em>’s designs.</p>
</blockquote><center></center>
<p>These safety measures weren’t enough to save the ship from the disaster. While traveling toward the Greek island of Lemnos, the <em>Britannic</em> hit a German naval mine and sank off the island of Kea on November 21, 1916. Of the 1,066 people on board, 30 lost their lives.</p>

<p>“<em>Britannic</em> was the largest vessel to sink during the Great War, [but] there was no catastrophic loss of life, unlike with the <em><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/8-famous-people-who-missed-the-lusitania-49564938/">Lusitania</a></em>, and no deliberate targeting of a hospital ship was evident,” notes the Western Front Association on <a href="https://www.westernfrontassociation.com/world-war-i-articles/the-loss-of-the-britannic-21-november-1916/">its website</a>. “As a result, the story of the <em>Britannic </em>is now largely forgotten.”</p>

<p>The <em>Titanic</em>’s sinking has long held immense <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-the-titanic-still-fascinates-us-98137822/">cultural fascination</a>. Last year, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/coal-recovered-from-the-titanic-and-thousands-of-other-historic-shipwreck-artifacts-are-going-to-auction-180985384/">coal</a> from the shipwreck sold for <a href="https://news.justcollecting.com/the-1500-lump-of-coal-a-titanic-buy-of-course/">£1,500</a>, while the controversial floating board from James Cameron’s 1997 film <em>Titanic</em><em> </em><em>fetched </em><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/controversial-titanic-door-sells-at-auction-180984050/">$718,750</a> at auction.</p>

<p>The <em><a href="https://www.whitestarhistory.com/olympic">Olympic</a></em>, the White Star Line’s lead ship, sailed for 24 years before its retirement in 1935. It served as a troopship during World War I, then returned to passenger service after the war.</p>
