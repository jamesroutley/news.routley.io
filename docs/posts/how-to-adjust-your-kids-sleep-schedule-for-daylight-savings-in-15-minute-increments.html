		<h3>How to Adjust Your Kids Sleep Schedule for Daylight Savings in 15 Minute Increments</h3>		<h4>by <span>Malte Skarupke</span></h4>

				<div>
			
<p>Daylight savings just ended so this post is coming exactly too late. But I was talking to a friend about how we just adjust 15 minutes per day, which is quite easy. She was saying “oh I wish I had that kind of foresight.” But we were talking Friday evening, and daylight savings didn’t end until Sunday, so there was plenty of time for adjustment. So since people don’t seem to realize that, here is the very simple plan for ending daylight savings:</p>



<h2>Autumn</h2>



<p>Lets say your kids bedtime is at 8pm (I wish) then</p>



<ul>
<li>On Friday go to bed 15 minutes late, 8:15pm</li>



<li>On Saturday go to bed 30 minutes late, 8:30pm</li>



<li>On Sunday go to bed 15 minutes early, 7:45pm</li>



<li>On Monday go to bed at your usual time, 8pm</li>
</ul>



<p>And with that you’re done. If you realize too late and it’s Saturday already, you can just do 20 minute increments:</p>



<ul>
<li>On Saturday go to bed 20 minutes late, 8:20pm</li>



<li>On Sunday go to bed 20 minutes early, 7:40pm</li>



<li>On Monday go to bed at your usual time, 8pm</li>
</ul>



<h2>Spring</h2>



<p>When daylight savings starts again in the spring, you just do the opposite each day:</p>



<ul>
<li>On Friday go to bed 15 minutes early, 7:45pm</li>



<li>On Saturday go to bed 30 minutes early, 7:30pm</li>



<li>On Sunday go to bed 15 minutes late, 8:15pm</li>



<li>On Monday go to bed at your usual time, 8pm</li>
</ul>



<p>Getting the kids to bed early is more difficult than getting them to bed late, so make sure to tire them out during the day by having plenty of activities. You may also want to combine this with waking them up early:</p>



<ul>
<li>On Friday wake up 15 minutes early, 6:45am</li>



<li>On Saturday wake up 30 minutes early, 6:30am</li>



<li>On Sunday wake up 15 minutes late, 7:15am</li>



<li>On Monday you’re back to normal, 7am</li>
</ul>



<h2>How well does this work?</h2>



<p>Not going to lie, it doesn’t work that well. But it works better than if you just switch 1 hour all at once. And before writing this I did some quick googling to see what others are advising, and for some reason the top results recommend schedules that start on <a href="https://www.takingcarababies.com/blogs/travel-and-holidays/daylight-savings-babys-sleep">Tuesday</a>, or god forbid <a href="https://creators.yahoo.com/lifestyle/story/the-15-minute-daylight-saving-time-hack-to-keep-kids-sleep-on-track-153023026.html">Monday</a>, which sounds much worse than this schedule… If you try to drag it out over that many days you’ll just have more conflict and more confusion around nap time or daycare or other activities. So I think mine is a pragmatic simple schedule that is better than doing nothing and doesn’t take that much effort.</p>



<p>It’s a real benefit that you need almost no planning. You can do it entirely over the weekend. You still have time when you realize Friday after work “oh crap, daylight savings is starting/ending, we need to adjust.”</p>



<p>So when daylight savings starts again in the spring you can look at this blog post again (or re-derive the plan, it’s not that hard) and do the adjustment in a short amount of time.</p>
