    <h1>Russian-manufactured armored vehicle vulnerability in urban combat (1997)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>	 Shoulder-fired antitank weapons and antitank grenades knocked out the bulk of armored
vehicles and each destroyed vehicle took an average of three to six lethal hits.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>     Fuel cells and
engines are favorite aiming points for Chechen antitank gunners. The following illustrations have
a grey area imposed which shows the area where 90% of the lethal hits occurred.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

<p>The BMD-1 is a personnel carrier assigned to airborne forces.  As such, it is lightly armored.</p>

<p>It was vulnerable to front, rear, flanking and top-down fire.  The front portion of the turret is
reinforced and,  consequently, not vulnerable, but the rear of the turret is.</p>

<p>There is more armor on the BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicle.  However, its top armor is weak, its
fuel tanks are within the rear doors and the driver&#39;s compartment is vulnerable.

<p>The BTR-70 wheeled armored personnel carrier showed many of the same vulnerabilities as the
BMD and BMP.  </p>

</div><div>	The Chechen forces developed effective techniques to defeat Russian armored vehicles
on the streets of a large city.  Many of their techniques can be adapted by other armed forces
which might fight Russian-manufactured armored vehicles (or other types of armored vehicles)
in urban combat.  These techniques are:

<ol>
<li>Organize anti-tank hunter-killer teams which include a machine gunner and a sniper to
protect the anti-tank gunner by suppressing infantry which is accompanying the armored
vehicles.

</li><li>Select anti-armor ambush areas in sections of the city where buildings restrict and
canalize the movement of armored vehicles.

</li><li>Lay out the ambush in order to seal off vehicles inside the kill zone.

</li><li>Use multiple hunter-killer teams to engage armored vehicles from basements, ground
level and from second- or third-floor positions.  A problem with the RPG-7 and RPG-18 antitank
weapons are the backblast, signature and time lapse between shots.  The Chechens solved the
time lapse problem by engaging each target simultaneously with five or six anti-tank weapons
(obvious requirements for a future anti-armor weapon for urban combat  is a low-signature,
multi-shot, recoil-attenuated, light-weight weapon which can be fired from inside enclosures. 
The AT-4 and Javelin do not appear to meet these requirements).

</li><li>Engage armored targets from the top, rear and sides.  Shots against frontal armor
protected by reactive armor only serve to expose the gunner.

</li><li>Engage accompanying air-defense guns first.

For the same period of time, forward-support Russian maintenance personnel repaired 217 armored vehicles, while depot maintenance repaired another 404 armored vehicles according to Sergey Maev and Sergey Roshchin, <strong>&#34;STO v Grozny&#34; (Technical Maintenance Stations in Grozny), <em>Armeyskiy sbornik (Army digest),</em></strong> December 1995, 58.  These were not all combat-induced losses, but it seems to indicate that 846 of 2221 armored vehicles (38%) were out of action for some period of time during the two-month battle for Grozny.
