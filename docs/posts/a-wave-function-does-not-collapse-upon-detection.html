    <h1>A wave function does not collapse upon detection?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>A particle always has an associated wave function. When we talk of a wave function &#39;collapsing&#39;, what we mean is that the form of the wave function changes as a consequence of a physical interaction- it doesn&#39;t mean that the wave function disappears. Also, you should not suppose that a particle such as an electron actually is a wave when its position is undetermined and suddenly switches to becoming a particle as a consequence of the wave function collapsing.</p>
<p>If you take the case of an electron that has been passed through some form of two slits experiment and is detected by a photographic plate, say, (I like old fashioned physics!), the position of the electron is narrowed down to a very large extent, but it is not a &#39;dead certainty&#39;, to use the terminology in your comment, that the electron is in a position that can be specified with unlimited precision. If an electron&#39;s position could be more and more precisely confined, then its associated wave function would become more and more to resemble a spike.</p>
<p>You might like to google the &#39;Dirac delta function&#39;, which is an idealised from of a wave function which has an infinitesimal spatial spread, so it is just a single spike giving a probability of 1 (ie certainty) for the electron being at one point in space and zero for the electron being anywhere else. That is an idealised extreme case- in reality you could not design an experiment that would localise an electron to that extent.</p>
<p>The other idealised extreme is a wave function that is a plane wave with a specific frequency. In theory such a wave has to be spread throughout space, which is not a realistic proposition. So a wave function in reality will always be something in between those two idealised extreme- either very spread out with a reasonably well-defined frequency, or very localised with a poorly defined frequency, or anywhere in between.</p>
<p>So, if you think of the wave function as just being a mathematical function that doesn&#39;t have to look like our everyday conception of a nicely periodic wave, and if you take &#39;collapse&#39; as meaning just &#39;change abruptly&#39; you might find some of the ideas of quantum mechanics easier to digest.</p>
