    <h1>My Favorite Software Subreddits</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>If you are an experienced software developer whose only exposure to
reddit is dank memes, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/proggit">proggit</a> or even
language-specific subreddits like
<a href="https://reddit.com/r/python">/r/python</a>, you&#39;re missing out.</p>
<p>What follows are my favorite subreddits in tech. My criteria is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subreddit topic is relevant to advancing as a programmer</li>
<li>Posts generally go into good depth</li>
<li>The comments stay on topic</li>
<li>And the shit-posting is minimal</li>
</ul>
<p>This list isn&#39;t hard to guess at if you consider advanced topics
in software. But I wanted to share because I think it&#39;s worth
explicitly supporting high-quality subreddits.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/">/r/EmuDev</a><ul>
<li>My favorite sub of all. Also has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/comments/9mop2q/join_the_official_remudev_chat_on_discord/">phenomenal Discord group</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programminglanguages">/r/ProgrammingLanguages</a><ul>
<li>Focuses a little more on PLT topics (parsing techniques, syntax, type systems) than on compiling and interpreting techniques, but still good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DatabaseDevelopment/">/r/DatabaseDevelopment</a><ul>
<li>Full disclosure: I started this subreddit last week, it&#39;s at 400+ members at time of publishing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/">/r/ReverseEngineering</a><ul>
<li>The largest subreddit on this list but still has pretty good posts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/esolangs/">/r/EsoLangs</a><ul>
<li>One of the best/most fun intros to programming languages/compilers/interpreters is through languages like Brainfuck. This sub does a good job of keeping the fun going.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UniKernel/">/r/UniKernel</a><ul>
<li>The smallest on this list but given its size they&#39;ve done a pretty good job of sharing good posts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GraphicsProgramming/">/r/GraphicsProgramming</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="special-mention">Special mention</h3><p>These subreddits are on great topics but haven&#39;t been maintained
well. They either need new moderators to revitalize them or there
needs to be a good alternative I can point you to.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retroprogramming/">/r/RetroProgramming</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DistributedSystems/">/r/DistributedSystems</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="networking?">Networking?</h3><p>I&#39;m still looking for a high-quality subreddit on networking
internals, software-defined networking, etc. Most of the existing
networking subreddits are oriented toward system/network
administrators.</p>
<p>If there is a good one already, send me it! If there&#39;s not, consider starting it!</p>
<h3 id="what-am-i-missing?">What am I missing?</h3><p>Am I missing other amazing subreddits? Just don&#39;t say language-specific ones!</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wrote a new blog post on my favorite subreddits; ones I think any experienced programmer would benefit from following. It starts with my favorite of all: /r/EmuDev.</p>â€” Phil Eaton (@phil_eaton) <a href="https://twitter.com/phil_eaton/status/1467536007448965129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2021</a></blockquote>
