<p><em>Seeking to understand others and communicate honestly is an essential democratic virtue. Can it be maintained in the digital age? </em></p><p ;="">Decades of culture war have degraded civic discourse, putting many open societies in a tailspin of bad faith public communications. Politicians, journalists, and everyday people on all sides intentionally mislead with facts, mischaracterize opposing views, and dehumanize those with whom they disagree.<sup id="textref-1"><a href="#fn-1" title="go to footnote">[1]</a></sup> Social media has started to change our basic habits of communication by amplifying and incentivizing bad faith tactics. Every day, whole populations are exposed to powerful forms of computational propaganda and other manipulative information.<sup id="textref-2"><a href="#fn-2" title="go to footnote">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>People are being deskilled in the art of good faith communication, while refining skills in bad faith tactics.</p>
<p ;="">Despite the new normal of widespread bad faith communication, good faith communication is always already available to all parties (see Box 1 below). But the choice to engage in good faith is an especially difficult choice to make in today’s culture. Powerful disincentives and barriers to making this choice have been put in place during many decades of escalating cultural conflict. Understanding why it has become so hard to engage in good faith communication is the first step towards shifting the cultural balance back in its favor.<sup id="textref-3"><a href="#fn-3" title="go to footnote">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<figure><img src="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/02/Bad-Faith_Box-1_3.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="3486" srcset="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/Bad-Faith_Box-1_3.jpg 600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/Bad-Faith_Box-1_3.jpg 1000w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/Bad-Faith_Box-1_3.jpg 1600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/02/Bad-Faith_Box-1_3.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>©Adaptive Cultures</figcaption></figure><p ;="">The situation has degraded to the point where it is widely believed that calls to good faith (such as this paper) are themselves acts of bad faith, undertaken only by those interested in controlling the discourse. Calls for good faith communication are understood at best as naive requests to calm the outrage and conflict that now runs rife in political discourse. Both ends of the political spectrum (the far left and the far right) express this view. Both sides believe that “the other side” simply can’t be trusted and therefore cannot be engaged in good faith. To do so would be to fall into a trap, serving only to validate the dangerous views of groups known to be acting in bad faith. </p>
<p>There should be no illusion: today’s culture war cannot be won by any side.</p>
<p ;="">All sides agree that in the absence of good faith communication the last resort is some form of violence. Despite this knowledge, many still assert that it is actually unethical to engage “the other side” in good faith. The result is that people are earnestly doing something they believe to be right—refusing to engage in good faith with those they disagree with—which is nevertheless leading towards a result they do not actually want. Meanwhile some parties actively seek to benefit from this dynamic, such as social media companies that leverage conflict for attention capture.<sup id="textref-5"><a href="#fn-5" title="go to footnote">[5]</a></sup> The culture war, like most wars, is a source of profit, and is therefore perpetuated despite the dangers. </p>
<p>When institutions that depend on public trust indulge in bad faith communications repeatedly, the legitimacy of these institutions declines.</p>
<p ;="">While insincere and manipulative communications have always been a part of human societies, our modern communications environment surpasses most recent historical periods in terms of the scale of its dysfunction. Comparisons may only be drawn with epochs characterized by failed states, civilizational collapse, and total war. Widespread inability to reach mutual understanding between members of the same society leads inevitably to social breakdown. When institutions that depend on public trust indulge in bad faith communications repeatedly, the legitimacy of these institutions declines. Unreliable communication compounds already complex social problems competing for citizens’ limited attention, including ecological, economic, health, and education crises.</p>
<figure><img src="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/02/Bad-Faith_Box-2_3.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="7808" srcset="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/Bad-Faith_Box-2_3.jpg 600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/Bad-Faith_Box-2_3.jpg 1000w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/Bad-Faith_Box-2_3.jpg 1600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/02/Bad-Faith_Box-2_3.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Box 2</figcaption></figure><p ;="">In the wake of digital communication technologies—especially social media—manipulative information has become vastly more powerful. As demonstrated elsewhere, social media enables <em>undue influence</em>.<sup id="textref-7"><a href="#fn-7" title="go to footnote">[7]</a></sup> What this means is that group membership established on social media can result in states akin to “brainwashing,” in which allegiance to the norms of the group and fear of ostracism cause extreme behaviors, both online and offline.</p>
<p>A &#34;post-truth” culture is a culture of bad faith.</p>
<p ;="">A key feature of escalating extremism is a belief that group membership requires bad faith engagements with out-groups. In these contexts, bad faith behavior is often justified to maintain in-group membership and consensus. The normalization of bad faith communication contributes to the creation of extreme in-group pressures, which can rupture identities and exacerbate mental health crises. Personal instabilities usually lead to a doubling down on the need for group membership, increasing rationalizations and amplifications of bad faith practices.<sup id="textref-8"><a href="#fn-8" title="go to footnote">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The remedy for ongoing bad faith communication is not more bad faith communication.</p>
<figure><img src="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/02/Bad-Faith_2-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="721" srcset="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/Bad-Faith_2-1.jpg 600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/Bad-Faith_2-1.jpg 1000w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/02/Bad-Faith_2-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>©Adaptive Cultures</figcaption></figure><p ;="">Good faith communication is both a complex skill and a value commitment that shapes personal identity. In other words: doing it is sufficiently difficult that getting good at it will change the kind of person that you are. But good faith engagement is often misconceived as a simple emotional stance leading to an overzealous search for agreement. In part, this is because naive good faith interactions can often be based on an innocent orientation towards peacemaking and the avoidance of conflict. This can be seen in the good faith engagement of a child who does not know that some people are untrustworthy. Unskillfully engaging in good faith can be a danger when others are acting in bad faith. </p>
<p>This is faith in a dynamic of communication that makes it possible to change positions, learn, and improve mutual understanding about essential shared realities.</p>
<p ;="">Designing technologies that enable good faith communication is not enough; also required is a culture that emphasizes its value as a shared social good. Once underway, good faith communication creates a self-reinforcing dynamic of mutual understanding—<em>even during disagreements</em>—that keeps open possibilities for learning and coordinated action. This is the reverse of the downward spiral of mutual distrust created by bad faith communication. Quick returns of social benefit result from investments in good faith communication across disagreements.</p>
<figure><img src="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/02/Bad-Faith_1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/Bad-Faith_1.jpg 600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/Bad-Faith_1.jpg 1000w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/02/Bad-Faith_1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>©Adaptive Cultures</figcaption></figure><p ;="">Finally, even though most contexts do not currently support it, there is some personal responsibility that can be taken. Despite the escalating culture war, individuals can cultivate the skills of good faith communication and demonstrate its value as a social good. You can practice disagreeing in ways that maintain relational integrity and respect. Reflect on values. Notice bad faith tactics. Hold politicians, officials, journalists, your friends, and yourself to a higher standard of communication. </p>
