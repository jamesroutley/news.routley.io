John Kavanagh made it illegal to record <a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/new-arizona-bill-would-prevent-people-from-filming-police-officers-closer-than-15-feet-away" target="_self">within 15 feet</a> of an officer interacting with someone unless the officer gave permission. The <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/2R/summary/H.HB2319_022322_HOUSEENGROSSED.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revised bill was approved </a>on a 31-28 party-line vote Feb. 23 and lowers the distance to 8 feet.</p>  <!----> <!----> <p>It also now allows someone who is in a car stopped by police or is being questioned to tape the encounter and limits the scope of the types of police actions that trigger the law to only those that are possibly dangerous.</p> <!----> <!----> <p>Kavanagh said <a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/house-panel-oks-revised-ban-on-videotaping-police1" target="_self">he made the changes</a> to address constitutional issues. He said the new 8-foot limit was based on a U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case involving abortion protesters.</p> <!----><!----> <!---->  <!----><!----> <!----> <p>Democratic Minority Leader Reginald Bolding said that the measure is the wrong way to boost transparency and ease the perception in minority communities that they are not safe from police misconduct.</p> <!----><!----> <!----> <p>&#34;One way to not do that is telling them that they cannot use their cellphones or do any type of recording unless it’s within a specific set of guidelines,&#34; Bolding said during the vote.</p> <!----><!----> <!----> <p>Media groups including The Associated Press said the measure raises serious constitutional issues. They signed onto <a href="https://nppa.org/sites/default/files/HB%202319%20Opposition%20Letter%2002-18-22%5B3%5D.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a letter from the National Press Photographers Association </a>in opposition to the bill. Letting an officer decide on the spot what First Amendment-protected activity should be allowed would be problematic in many situations, the letter said.</p> <!----><!----> <!----> <p>Kavanagh’s bill makes a violation a petty offense, the lowest-level Arizona crime that can bring a fine but no jail time. Refusing to stop recording when an officer orders it would be a low-level misdemeanor subject to a 30-day jail sentence.</p> <!----><!----> <!----> <p>The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration.</p> <!----><!----> <!----> <h2>More Arizona politics</h2> <!----><!----> <!----> <ul data-v-03e8ff79=""><li data-v-03e8ff79=""><span data-v-03e8ff79=""><a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-house-oks-gop-bill-backing-gun-businesses1" target="_self"><strong>Arizona House OKs GOP bill backing gun businesses</strong></a></span></li><li data-v-03e8ff79=""><span data-v-03e8ff79=""><a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/allister-adel-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-controversies-surrounding-the-maricopa-county-attorney" target="_self"><strong>Allister Adel: Here&#39;s what you need to know about the controversies surrounding the Maricopa County Attorney</strong></a></span></li><li data-v-03e8ff79=""><span data-v-03e8ff79=""><a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/expanded-parental-rights-fight-brews-at-arizona-legislature1" target="_self"><strong>Expanded parental rights fight brews at Arizona Legislature</strong></a></span></li></ul> <!----><!----> <!----> <p><a href="https://fox10phoenix.onelink.me/9Eg5?pid=Web&amp;c=in_article&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fox10phoenix.com%2Fapps" target="_blank"><i><strong>For the latest local news, download the FOX 10 News app.</strong></i></a></p> <!----><!----> <!----> <p>Tune in to FOX 10 Phoenix for the latest news:</p> <!----><!---->  <!----> <!---->  </div> <!----></div> </div></div>
