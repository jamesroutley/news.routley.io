				<div id="element-207"><div><div><h2>Penguin of the Year 2022 - Voting Now Open!</h2><p>The original Penguin of the Year is back for its fifth year. Last year saw our infamous ‘bad boy’ Mo taking out the title after three years as a finalist. It could be anyone’s crown to take and it’s up to you, their dedicated fans, to vote for your favourite.</p><p>Dora could be your fav for having a high profile this year appearing as Naughty Penguin of the Month more than most for stealing the limelight during keeper talks, having a continued vendetta against the male keepers and wanting to stay in bed all day. Martin and Dave like to squabble, and Marina and new arrival Kaewa have a made a name for themselves chasing the divers and leading others astray.</p><p>Whether it’s Pepper, Flip, Burny or any of our other wonderful kororā, YOU can get the chance to have your say. View the penguin profiles board and vote for your favourite below.</p><p>There’s a slight change of format for voting this year, it’s all about getting your votes in early, with a sneak peek at the polls part way through and going straight to the winner announcement on Wednesday 14 September.</p></div></div></div>
