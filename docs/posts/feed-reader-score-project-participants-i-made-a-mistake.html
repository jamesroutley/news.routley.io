    <h1>Feed reader score project participants: I made a mistake</h1>
    
    
<p>
A short note to my feed reader score project participants: I screwed up 
something fierce the other day.  I set some bad dates for 
the Last-Modified header.  It&#39;s all done in code, and it&#39;s not based on 
an actual file, so it&#39;s possible to set *nearly* any value in there.
</p>
<p>
It started when I either fat-fingered or stupid-houred this date the 
other day:
</p>
<p>
Thu, 08 Jun 2023 00:04:45 GMT
</p>
<p>
That was in the GET handler for the test feed for about a day.  Then, 
when I &#34;fixed&#34; it, I set it to something a few days in the future:
</p>
<p>
Thu, 20 Jun 2024 00:04:45 GMT
</p>
<p>
It was only June 16th when I did that.  Oops.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this started showing up as all kinds of crazy If-Modified-Since 
values being presented by clients, and I thought those clients were 
taking the value from my end and were &#34;clamping&#34; it to the current time.  
Instead, nope, it was all on my side.
</p>
<p>
Would you believe that Apache httpd will do that all by itself?  Yep.  
If you have a CGI program which emits a Last-Modified header in the 
future, it&#39;ll totally squish it down to the current date/time instead.
</p>
<p>
Further complicating the matter is that I logged the values that I 
*thought* were being served up, and then used them to run comparisons 
and generate warnings when they didn&#39;t match.
</p>
<p>
My sincere apologies to anyone who spent the last couple of days chasing 
after a problem that was totally created by me on this end.
</p>
<p>
Now I get to figure out how to clean up my mess.  Fun!
