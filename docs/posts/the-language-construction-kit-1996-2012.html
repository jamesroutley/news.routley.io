<p>The LCK is also available in a <a href="https://www.zompist.com/lckbook.html">print edition</a>, four times the length, published by Yonagu Books on Amazon.

</p><p>When you&#39;re done with that, you’ll want <b> <a href="https://www.zompist.com/lck2.html"><i>Advanced Language Construction</i></a></b>!  Does the LCK seem pretty basic to you, and you want to delve into morphosyntax, logographic languages, predicate logic, and more?  Get the sequel today! 

</p><p>Next is <b><a href="https://www.zompist.com/lexipedia.html"><i>The Conlanger’s Lexipedia</i></a></b>: everything you know to create words that aren’t a simple copy of English.  Creating the lexicon is the part of conlanging that takes the most time and requires the most real-world knowledge; you need this book to help.

</p><p>My latest book is <b><a href="https://www.zompist.com/syntax.html"><i>The Syntax Construction Kit</i></a></b>: all about modern Syntax, from Chomsky and many others. A deep dive into how language works, with an excursus into computer generation of languages.

<p><i>This set of webpages (what’s a set of webpages?  a webchapter?)  is intended for anyone who wants to create artificial languages— for a fantasy or an alien world, as a hobby, as an interlanguage.  It presents linguistically sound methods for creating naturalistic languages— which can be reversed to create non-naturalistic languages.  It suggests further reading for those who want to know more, and shortcuts for those who want to know less.

<p>The above is a sample of an artificial language of my own, Verdurian.  If you’re curious, it reads <b>Ďitelán mu cum pén veaďen er mësan so Sannam</b>, meaning “Go forth in peace to love and serve the Lord.”  The accented <b>Ď</b> sounds like the <i>th</i> in <i>then</i>; the vowels should be pronounced more or less as in Spanish.  <a href="http://www.zompist.com/sounds/Dhitelan1.mp3">Here’s a recording</a> of Joseph Fatula reading it.

</p><p><i>How about a </i>suite<i> of webpages?  Does that sound better?
</i>

</p><hr/>
<p>Before I could write this little inscription I had to:

</p><ul>
<li>Decide on the sounds of the language
</li><li>Create the lexicon
</li><li>Create the grammar
</li><li>Design an alphabet
</li><li>Decide how the alphabet is modified for cursive handwriting
</li><li>Translate the desired text
</li></ul>

<p><a name="dichotomy">You may have two reactions to this:</a>

</p><ol>
<li><a href="https://www.zompist.com/kitcool.html">“Cool!  <b>I</b> want to do that!”</a>
</li><li><a href="https://www.zompist.com/kitgeek.html">“What a geek you must be.  Get a life!”</a>
</li></ol>
	
The order of the steps above is significant.  Working backwards (e.g. creating a text and then devising a grammar to match) will lead to an inconsistent if not incoherent work.  

A bad example is Hergé’s Syldavian; since he basically made it up in pieces, as he needed it, it’s impossible to create a consistent phonology or morphology for it, based on the scraps of the language provided in the Tintin books.  (This didn’t prevent me from coming up with my best attempt at a <a href="https://www.zompist.com/syldavian.html">Syldavian grammar</a>.)
