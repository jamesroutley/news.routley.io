  <h2>You can&#39;t fork your own GitHub repo (but you can get pretty close)</h2>
  <time datetime="2025-06-25T00:00:00-04:00">25 Jun 2025</time>
  
  <p>I wanted to fork my own GitHub repo the other day, and it turns out you can’t. Instead, I got most of what I needed by duplicating the repo, and adding the original <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/managing-remote-repositories">as a second remote</a>.</p>

<p>Why would you even want to fork your own repo? Here’s my situation. In my <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2025/06/generating-infinite-sea-shanty-in-the-browser/">last blog post</a>, I embedded a small page with some javascript to play the audio I was describing. I’m actively working on that code, and to be able to look at it remotely or share it with friends, I’ve got a small Action that builds the single page and pushes to GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>I could’ve just embedded the resulting page, but it’s under active development and I don’t want to accidentally break something in the blog post. Really, I want a snapshot — but I also want to be able to deliberately pull in changes to that snapshot as necessary.</p>

<p>Usually that would mean you could just make a branch. But in this case I wanted a Pages environment, which is allotted at the repo level.</p>

<p>So instead, I cloned the repository, pushed it to a new GitHub repo, and then used <code>git remote add</code> to add back the Git URL of the original repo as a second remote. That preserves the shared history, and I can even commingle commits. You don’t quite get the interface sugar of pull requests across the two repos, but you can pull upstream changes into a downstream branch and open a PR that way.</p>

<p>One other option I considered: You <em>can</em> fork your own repo into one owned by an <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations">organization</a>, so if I were doing this workflow a lot, maybe I’d make an organization that just owns blog-embedding-related repos. For now, though, the duplicated repo did the trick.</p>
