    <h1>MSI confirms cyberattack, warns against unofficial firmware</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Owners of MSI-brand motherboards, GPUs, notebooks, PCs, and other equipment should exercise caution when updating their device&#39;s firmware or BIOS after the manufacturer revealed it has recently suffered a cyberattack.</p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Statement-141688">statement</a> shared on Friday, MSI urged users &#34;to obtain firmware/BIOS updates only from its official website,&#34; and to avoid using files from other sources.</p>
<p>While this may sound like common sense, it&#39;s not unusual to find custom BIOS firmware for PC hardware, particularly for GPUs, floating around enthusiast forums. However, the reason behind MSI&#39;s warning may have more to do with the kinds of data allegedly stolen during the attack.</p>

    

<p>As <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/money-message-ransomware-gang-claims-msi-breach-demands-4-million/">reported</a> earlier this week, a group of ne&#39;er-do-wells known as Money Message bragged on their dark-web site what they claimed to be screenshots of MSI&#39;s CTMS and ERP databases, as well as source code, private keys, and BIOS firmware.</p>

        


        

<p>That&#39;s material that really shouldn&#39;t fall into the wrong hands as it can be used to create malicious firmware clones, which folks could be tricked into trusting and installing.</p>
<p>Indeed, the gang claims to have all the tools necessary to develop a potentially malicious BIOS and then digitally sign it in a way that it appears legitimate and can be installed on victims&#39; PCs once they&#39;re lured into downloading it. Assuming the miscreants haven&#39;t poisoned MSI&#39;s downloads, you&#39;ll really want to avoid installing what turns out to be malware at the firmware level and instead stick to the official updates.</p>

        

<p>Additionally, the crew has threatened to release this data, allegedly totaling 1.5TB, unless MSI pays a $4 million ransom within the next few days.</p>

</ul>
<p>In its statement, MSI did not address the extent of the security breach, nor what was stolen, stating only that it &#34;detected network anomalies,&#34; and its IT department &#34;activated relevant defense mechanisms and carried out recovery measures.&#34;</p>
<p>The hardware maker said it reported the intrusion to the cops and cybersecurity agencies. It also downplayed any potential repercussions, stating that it had returned to normal operations and didn&#39;t anticipate any &#34;significant impact&#34; to its financials. However, it&#39;s not clear at this point whether customer data was compromised in the network breach.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> reached out to MSI for comment; we&#39;ll let you know if we hear anything back.</p>
<p>The apparent theft comes less than a month after Acer, another prominent PC maker, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/08/acer_confirms_server_breach/">suffered</a> a cyberattack of its own. In that case, a 160GB database containing confidential information was allegedly exfiltrated and offered for sale on the now <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/22/breachforums_shut_down/">defunct</a> hacker bazaar Breach Forums.
