    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, March 15, 2024</em></p><p>I’ve been pretty heads down trying to get the first version of tinyping done this week. Here are the highlights:</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><ol><li>Automerge is very cool, and it seems like it might even be able to do the encrypted syncing that I want. Data migrations are really tricky though, though.</li><li>I’m using Elm for this, since I’m super familiar with it, but the way I’m setting up the app right now means duplicating responsibility for data storage. Not great.</li><li>The hardest part has been figuring out how to schedule pings according to the right distribution when there is no central authority. I <em>think</em> I have a solution though: using the last ping’s timestamp as a random seed should allow all clients to converge on the same sequence of pings. (Assuming the lambda value does not change, anyway!)</li></ol><p>Despite the difficulties, I’m starting to see the bigger picture of how the app will work. That feels pretty encouraging!</p></article></div>
