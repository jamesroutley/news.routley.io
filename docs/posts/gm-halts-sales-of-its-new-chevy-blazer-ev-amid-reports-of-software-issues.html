    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GM has issued a stop-sale order for the Chevy Blazer EV just weeks after its release following reports of software problems that made the vehicle undrivable. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Edmunds;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6a686c6e-b7e2-4710-a51c-d3aa72b17ad0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Edmunds&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZG11bmRzLmNvbS9jYXItbmV3cy9jaGV2eS1ibGF6ZXItZXYtc3RvcC1zYWxlLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjI3YjNjMTg5LWI2MTItNGRmMC05YzUyLTcwYmNlMTg0YTBiNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZVMfuAojMqpxX1HwJGLL7rh7n4GQAzuXy2vumXTf_dR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fcar-news%2Fchevy-blazer-ev-stop-sale.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Edmunds;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Edmunds;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0"><em><ins>Edmunds</ins></em></a>, which received confirmation on Friday night that the company is halting deliveries, previously documented 23 issues during tests of the SUV, including the infotainment system repeatedly crashing and displaying a multitude of error messages. <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://insideevs.com/reviews/701169/2024-blazer-ev-stranded-broken/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Inside EVs;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0"><em><ins>Inside EVs</ins></em></a> writer Kevin Williams also tested the Blazer EV and not only encountered similar problems with the display, but was left stranded after the car broke down while charging.</p><p>In a statement to <em>Edmunds</em>, Chevrolet said, “We are aware that a limited number of Blazer EV owners have experienced some software quality issues. To ensure our customers have a great experience with their vehicle, we are temporarily pausing sales of Blazer EVs.” All new deliveries are on pause, VP Scott Bell said.</p><p>The Chevrolet Blazer EV is powered by GM’s Ultium battery system, which is being used in a slew of other vehicles including the GMC Hummer EV and the Cadillac Lyriq. Those, too, have been the subject of plenty of complaints, as <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://insideevs.com/news/702126/ultium-platform-owners-gm/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Inside EVs;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0"><em><ins>Inside EVs</ins></em></a> reported.
