    <h1>Nexus: An Open-Source AI Router for Governance, Control and Observability</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Today, we&#39;re excited to introduce <strong>Nexus</strong> - a powerful AI router designed to optimize how AI agents interact with multiple MCP tools and Large Language Models. Nexus serves as a central hub that aggregates Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers while providing intelligent LLM routing, security and governance capabilities.</p>

<p>Nexus is an AI router that solves two critical challenges in the AI ecosystem:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>MCP Server Aggregation</strong>: Instead of managing connections to multiple MCP servers individually, Nexus consolidates them into a single, unified interface</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent LLM Routing</strong>: Nexus intelligently routes requests to the most appropriate language model based on the task, cost considerations, and performance requirements</li>
</ol>

<p>As AI applications become more sophisticated, they increasingly need to interact with multiple external services, APIs, and different language models. This creates several pain points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context</strong>: Helps the LLM select from a potentially large number of MCP tools without overwhelming it</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: Lack of strategic model selection can lead to unnecessary expenses</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong>: Provides insights into the performance and behavior of the AI system, enabling better decision-making and troubleshooting</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Ensures that requests are routed securely and in compliance with governance policies</li>
</ul>

<p>Nexus acts as a proxy layer that connects to multiple MCP servers simultaneously. When your AI agent needs to access external tools or data sources, it makes a single request to Nexus, which then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helps the LLM to identify the appropriate MCP server(s) for the request</li>
<li>Handles authentication and connection management</li>
<li>Aggregates responses from multiple sources when needed</li>
<li>Provides a consistent API interface regardless of the underlying MCP implementations</li>
</ul>

<p>Nexus considers multiple factors when selecting the optimal language model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task Type</strong>: Different models excel at different tasks (reasoning, coding, creative writing)</li>
<li><strong>Latency Requirements</strong>: Route to faster models when speed is prioritized</li>
<li><strong>Context Length</strong>: Select models that can handle your context requirements</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>: Fallback to alternative models when primary choices are unavailable</li>
</ul>


<p>Replace complex point-to-point connections with a single integration point, reducing system complexity and maintenance overhead.</p>

<p>Monitor and analyze the performance of your models in real-time, identify bottlenecks, and optimize your routing strategy.</p>

<p>Add new MCP servers or LLM providers without changing your application code.</p>

<p>Built-in failover mechanisms ensure your AI agents stay operational even when individual services experience issues.</p>

<p>Nexus is designed to integrate seamlessly into your existing AI workflow. Whether you&#39;re building customer service bots, code generation tools, or complex reasoning systems, Nexus can help streamline your architecture while improving performance and reducing costs.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning for Nexus. We&#39;re working on additional features including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced routing algorithms</li>
<li>Real-time analytics and monitoring dashboards</li>
<li>Custom routing rules and policies</li>
<li>Client-based rate limiting and observability</li>
<li>Enhanced security and compliance features</li>
</ul>
<p>The future of AI applications lies in intelligent orchestration, and Nexus is our contribution to making that future more accessible and efficient for developers everywhere.</p>
