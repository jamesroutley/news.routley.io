    <p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="5">Urban 
    Legends Prevail when it comes to U.S. Army&#39;s Camouflage Improvement Effort </SPAN></b></p>
    <p><i><span>
    <SPAN size="3">(Vancouver, B.C. May 21, 2013)</SPAN></span></i><SPAN size="3"><span><span>Â </span></span></SPAN><span><SPAN size="3">The 
    U.S. Army’s Phase IV Camouflage Improvement Effort has come under heavy 
    criticism as the general public reads news stories that the Army is once again 
    considering changing their camouflage and that the costs are in the billions.</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">As an 
    expert in camouflage (I have worked with over 50 countries and currently over 2,300,000 military uniforms have been issued with 
    patterns I’ve developed and I teamed up with ADS Inc. of Virginia Beach and 
    our [ADS INc./Guy Cramer] US4CES family of camouflage was selected as a finalist in the Phase IV program), I will use 
    this opportunity to discuss many of the fallacies of the arguments which I 
    am seeing on the discussion boards and blogs which have started a frenzy of 
    opposition to programs which have been ongoing for a number of years with 
    very little interest until now.
    </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><b><span><SPAN size="5">
    Didn’t the Olive Drab (monotone) uniforms work, why did the U.S. military switch to 
    camouflage in the first place?</SPAN></span></b></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">Canada wore Olive Drab 
    fatigues up until the late 1990’s when their military research showed that 
    there is a 45 percent less chance of being detected from 50-300 meters away 
    with their new CADPAT (Canadian Disruptive Pattern). They also found that 
    the enemy had to be 35% closer to a soldier wearing CADPAT to detect him/her 
    over the soldier wearing a Monotone (Olive Drab) Uniform. </SPAN></span>
    </p>
    
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">Further NATO trials 
    among all camouflage uniforms used by all the countries that make up NATO 
    showed that CADPAT outperformed all other camouflages including U.S. 
    Woodland, British DPM, German Flectarn...</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><SPAN size="3"><span>Recent NATO studies in 
    2012 in Australia confirmed that CADPAT TW is one of the most effective 
    patterns in Tropical and Subtropical regions. </span></SPAN></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">CADPAT is the first 
    pixelated camouflage to be issued. The U.S. Army had experimented with 
    pixelated camouflage uniforms in the 1980&#39;s the biggest issue was people 
    outside of the testing could not understand how something so artificial 
    looking could be more effective than the standard blobby camouflage. The 
    Canadian and NATO studies changed that perception.<b> </b> </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><SPAN size="5"><b><span>MARPAT (USMC Pattern)</span></b></SPAN></p>
    <p><span>
    <SPAN size="3">The USMC became very interested in CADPAT once the pattern 
    had been validated by both Canada and NATO. With the permission of the 
    Canadian Government the USMC was granted permission to use the same pattern 
    (but in different colors). The USMC used the exact same print screens and 
    recolored the pattern to meet their requirements even going so far to call 
    the new coloration MARPAT (the Marines made a slight change to the print 
    screens adding a small USMC Globe and Anchor to print every few feet). (1)</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">The USMC conducted their 
    own objective trials on MARPAT and found that it outperformed Olive Drab in 
    detection taking more than 3 times longer to detect and once detected just 
    over 2.5 times longer to identify the target. The same study also showed 
    that the digital pattern outperformed the NATO camouflage (used to 
    camouflage vehicles and similar to the U.S. BDU Woodland pattern) – in both 
    detection and identification. (2)</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><SPAN size="3"><span>The USMC began to issue 
    Woodland MARPAT and Desert MARPAT in 2001</span></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="3"><span>The chart below on the 
    left is Detection (Where is it) and the chart below on the right is 
    Recognition (What is it).</span></SPAN></p>
    
    <p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="5">The U.S. Army Universal Camouflage Pattern</SPAN></b></p>
    <p><SPAN face="Arial" size="3">Rather than switching to a Woodland and 
    Desert like the Marines, the U.S. Army switch to a pixelated Universal 
    Camouflage Pattern (UCP) (all-in-one pattern) in 2004</SPAN></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">Â It turns out that field trials were never carried out on UCP before it was 
    issued. </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><SPAN face="Arial">
    <img src="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/UCP-Display.jpg" width="272" height="410"/></SPAN></p>
    <p><b><span><SPAN size="5">How did the idea of 
    All-In-One/Universal camouflage originate? </SPAN></span></b></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">There was a 
    study carried out by the Army between 2002-2004 to find a new camouflage to 
    replace the BDU Woodland Camouflage and DCU Desert camouflage uniforms with 
    something more effective. The program started out in 2002 with Phase 1 and 2 
    looking at Woodland, Desert, Urban and Desert/Urban environments in three 
    patterns developed by the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Center.</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/Natick-Patterns-2002.jpg">
    <SPAN face="Arial">
    <img src="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/Natick-Patterns-2002_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Natick-Patterns-2002.jpg" width="600" height="452"/></SPAN></a></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">Â In 
    2003 for Phase 3 of this particular test they merged common colors from each pattern 
    into an all-in-one environment coloration, this is when compromises were 
    made of colors to attempt to achieve one pattern, with one color scheme for 
    all environments.</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/All-Over-Brush-Phases.jpg">
    <SPAN face="Arial">
    <img src="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/All-Over-Brush-Phases_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="All-Over-Brush-Phases.jpg" width="600" height="449"/></SPAN></a></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">As the idea 
    of an all-in-one coloration began to take shape and a critical aspect began to 
    emerge with NIR (Near Infrared) colorations (many colors do not work well in 
    the NIR or SWIR [Short Wave Infrared] leading to high visibility of the 
    target under Night Vision technology. Note in the table below that none of 
    the desert colors worked well in the NIR spectrum (we will get to this 
    later), and the only acceptable colors from the other 
    environments were Black (Woodland), Medium Gray (Urban) and Medium Tan 
    (Desert/Urban).</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/Natick-NIR-Colors.jpg">
    <SPAN face="Arial">
    <img src="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/Natick-NIR-Colors_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Natick-NIR-Colors.jpg" width="600" height="450"/></SPAN></a></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">Remember 
    that in military operations, half of the time you are dealing with night 
    conditions, so the NIR and SWIR becomes close to half of the solution.
    </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><SPAN size="3"><span>At this time Multicam 
    entered the competition as the &#34;Contractor Developed Mod&#34;, </span></SPAN><span><SPAN size="3">
    Multicam like UCP also originated from the concept of a global palette: </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">Once the 
    final 4 patterns were tested in the 3 separate environments (Woodland, Urban 
    and Desert) in both daylight and nighttime with NIR scopes, all four showed 
    variable effectiveness across all terrains in daylight but were almost 
    identical in the Night (NIR) testing. Multicam (called Contractor Developed 
    Mod in the test) scored 43 out of 100 (100 being the best) at Ft. Pok 
    (Desert) in daytime and 77 out of 100 at Night (NIR), but in Woodland 
    environments at Ft. Benning Multicam only scored 57 out of 100 in daytime and 48 
    out of 100 at night. </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><SPAN size="3"><span>Note the Data Analysis - 
    Day chart on the left (below) shows effectiveness from 40 to 65 (out of 100) 
    whereas the Data Analysis - Night on the Right (below) shows effectiveness 
    from 40 to 90 (out of 100)</span></SPAN></p>
    
    <p><SPAN face="Arial" size="3">I&#39;ve redone the bar chart below based from 
    the Daytime results above but the difference in my chart below is with a 
    scale from 0-100% (100 being the best). The compromise across Woodland / 
    Urban / Desert in exchange for an All-In-One global color scheme can clearly 
    be seen.Â  </SPAN></p>
    <p>
    <img src="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/Natick-Day-Results-2004-Bar-Graph.jpg" width="628" height="478"/></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">The overall 
    winner of the competition was All-Over-Brush (Multicam &#34;Contractor Developed 
    Mod.&#34; placed 3<sup>rd</sup> out of the 4 final patterns but as you can see 
    from the chart above there was not a great deal of separation among the 4 
    patterns.). (3) </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/Natick-2004-Conclusions.jpg">
    <SPAN face="Arial">
    <img src="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/Natick-2004-Conclusions_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Natick-2004-Conclusions.jpg" width="600" height="449"/></SPAN></a></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">So the Army 
    had found a solution but the results were not encouraging, to get an 
    all-in-one pattern you needed to compromise and lose effectiveness in all 
    environments versus a more effective coloration for each environment. </SPAN>
    </span></p>
    <p><b><span><SPAN size="5">
    Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP)</SPAN></span></b></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">Shortly 
    after these results were obtained Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP) was 
    announced by the U.S. Army in 2004. However, UCP was not part of the 
    2002-2004 testing (it is a common misconception that UCP was derived from 
    these tests, probably because the name of the pattern is Universal 
    Camouflage Pattern (UCP) and the name of the test was Universal Camouflage 
    For The Future Force Warrior), while the Power Point that now accompanies 
    the test results (shown in the slides above) shows UCP on left side background of each 
    slide, the UCP pattern was in-fact not part of the test. </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><b><span><SPAN size="5">Where 
    did UCP come from?</SPAN></span></b></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">The U.S. 
    Army used the same screens as CADPAT/MARPAT and recolored them based on 
    three universal colors determined from the U.S. Army 2002-2004 tests to come 
    up with UCP, (two of the screens use the same color) again they picked 
    colors based off of the 2002-2004 study but did not actually test the UCP 
    pattern with those colors. The pattern itself was proven with the Canadians 
    and USMC so combining an effective pattern with a new color scheme should 
    provide a good all-in-one pattern? Wrong in the case of UCP. (we will see 
    later that in the case of the U.S. Navy&#39;s AOR-Universal - they managed to 
    get it close with different coloration)</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><SPAN face="Arial">
    <img src="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/cadpat-us-variations.jpg" width="824" height="674"/></SPAN></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">It didn’t 
    take long after soldiers were issued this new camouflage to notice that the 
    UCP was not working and with combat operations going on in both Iraq and 
    Afghanistan, the U.S. Congress began to receive complaints from soldiers 
    that the camouflage was jeopardizing their missions and their lives. The 
    U.S. Congress asked the Army for the research that led to the decision on 
    UCP and it was discovered that there was none. It appears that someone 
    circumnavigated the scientific process and forced UCP in. </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">The 
    decision to not use the All-Over-Brush (winner of 2002-2004 trials) and to 
    go with the untested UCP has not been fully disclosed but it appears that it 
    was not the fault of the Army groups involved who went to extreme lengths in 
    the 2002-2004 testing to find something which met the criteria.</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><b><SPAN size="5"><span>Testing UCP</span></SPAN><span><SPAN size="5">
    </SPAN></span></b></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">The U.S. 
    Army (Natick) then conducted the testing on UCP and 17 other patterns 
    between 2007-2008 and the results with the final 13 patterns showed UCP 
    performed poorly in Desert scoring 9<sup>th</sup> out of 13 patterns, Urban 
    (8<sup>th</sup> place) and Woodland (12<sup>th</sup> place). Multicam was 
    better scoring 6<sup>th</sup> out of 13 in Desert, Urban (4<sup>th</sup> 
    place) and Woodland (6<sup>th</sup> place). The two MARPAT patterns tested 
    extremely well: with Desert MARPAT scoring 3<sup>rd</sup> place out of 13 
    patterns in Desert, Urban (1<sup>st</sup> place) and the Woodland MARPAT 
    scored (2<sup>nd</sup> place in Woodland)</SPAN></span></p>

    <p><span><SPAN size="3">A trend was 
    starting to develop in the research – All-In-One color schemes were not proving as effective 
    as color specific camouflage (colored specific to the intended operating 
    environment). These graphs are based on the results of the NATICK 2007-2008 
    Study</SPAN></span></p>

    <SPAN size="5">U.S. Army Phase III Camouflage Improvement</SPAN></span></b></p>
    <p><span>
    <SPAN size="3">The U.S. Congress at this point had enough information to 
    have the U.S. Army begin the process to find a solution to the failed UCP, 
    but of critical importance were the ground troops in Afghanistan where UCP 
    was not working. A worldwide solution &#34;Phase IV&#34; would take much more time 
    to research properly so this Phase 3 focused on the specific environments 
    found in Afghanistan. </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span>
    <SPAN size="3">The U.S. Army Camouflage Improvement Phase 3 Effort (U.S. 
    Congressional Mandate) was to find a fast solution to those combat troops in 
    Afghanistan so another set of tests were done by Natick in environments 
    which would be found within this area.</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span>
    <SPAN size="3">In Afghanistan you didn’t have large areas that are either woodland or desert; it 
    was more of an in-between setting now referred to as “Transitional” 
    environments. All the testing up until this time had focused on Woodland, 
    Desert and Urban and yet a large part of the world is within Transitional.</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span>
    <SPAN size="3">The results of this Phase 3 testing concluded that within 
    Afghanistan type environments Multicam outperformed  the other 
    patterns within these environments</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span>
    <SPAN size="3">In Rocky Desert terrain </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span>
    <SPAN size="3">1st Place Multicam<span>Â </span></SPAN></span></p>

    <p><span><SPAN size="3">There are a 
    few noteworthy items we can pull out of these results.</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">Multicam 
    won the competition with an overall score of 80 out of 100 and this led to 
    it winning the Phase 3 trials and becoming the pattern known in the U.S. 
    Army as OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF). We can also see that it scored 
    72.5 out of 100 in Cropland/Woodland tests and 58.3 out of 100 in Sandy 
    Desert Terrain. It did not break the top 10 patterns tested in either of 
    these two critical environments. This confirmed to the Army that the 
    All-In-One concept was likely not achievable with conventional camouflage. 
    The results for Cropland/Woodland and Sandy Desert were similar to the 
    previous tests with Multicam but now it was placed within &#34;transitional&#34; 
    (Rocky Desert and Mountainous) environments which was specific to it&#39;s 
    coloration.Â  </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><SPAN face="Arial">
    <img src="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/Multicam-Scores-2009.jpg" width="628" height="478"/></SPAN></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">Also note 
    that the U.S. Navy AOR-2 placed second in Cropland/Woodland with a score 
    85.1 out of 100 (12.6% better than Multicam/OEF).
    MARPAT Woodland was beat by the Navy’s AOR2 (same pattern but recolored), 
    and the Navy’s AOR1 beat the MARPAT Desert in Sandy Desert Terrains. </SPAN>
    </span></p>
    <p><SPAN face="Arial">
    <img src="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/AOR2-Scores-2009.jpg" width="628" height="478"/>
    </SPAN> </p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">Digital DCU 
    placed first in the Sandy Desert with a score of at least 89.7 out of 100 
    (31% better than Multicam/OEF)(Note the table does not include scores for 
    Digital DCU with matching PPE (Personal Protective Equipment -in this case 
    the torso vest) - it does included Digitial DCU with Khaki PPE at 89.7 and 
    we are told that the winner was DigitaDCU witlh matching PPE, so we can 
    assume the score with matching gear - PPE was higher than 89.7%)</SPAN></span></p>

    <p><span><SPAN size="3">UCP was a 
    failure within this test scoring a dismal overall score of 27.8 out of 100 
    in all four environments confirming the previous testing. </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><SPAN face="Arial">
    <img src="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/UCP-Scores-2009.jpg" width="628" height="478"/></SPAN></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">UCP-C (not 
    shown) was 
    an attempt to fix the UCP pattern by adding Brown as a color – it 
    did help in the Cropland/Woodland tests where it placed 4<sup>th </sup>(it 
    beat Multicam), but it could not compete overall.</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">The Navy’s 
    AOR-Universal equaled Multicam in the mountainous terrain but did not do as 
    well in Rocky Desert or Cropland/Woodland backgrounds, it did 9% better in 
    Sandy Desert than Multicam. Remember that UCP and AOR-Universal use the same 
    screens - same pattern - different colors. UCP failure was not the pattern 
    but the colors used.</SPAN></span></p>
    <p>
    <SPAN face="Arial">
    <img src="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/Universal-AOR-Scores-2009.jpg" width="628" height="478"/></SPAN></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">The BDU 
    Woodland 
    pattern (used for over 20 years by the U.S. Military) which many people 
    expect is still a good pattern only scored at 59.8 out of 100 in 
    Cropland/Woodland testing and 1.3 out of 100 in Sandy Desert (you can&#39;t get 
    much worse than 1 out of 100). </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><SPAN face="Arial">
    <img src="https://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/BDU-Scores-2009.jpg" width="628" height="478"/></SPAN></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">So the 
    current baseline patterns for the U.S. Army Phase IV Camouflage Effort were 
    based off of the best patterns within this most current series of tests. 
    Both AOR1 and AOR2 outperformed both MARPAT Woodland and MARPAT Desert 
    patterns in Cropland/Woodland and Sandy Desert to become the baseline 
    patterns. </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span>
    <SPAN size="5">The U.S. Army Phase IV 
    Baseline patterns: </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">
    Woodland/Tropical = AOR2</SPAN></span></p>
    <p>
    <span>
    <SPAN size="3">Transitional= Multicam</SPAN></span></p>

    <span>
    <SPAN size="3">Desert/Arid= AOR1Â  Â Â Â Â </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><b><span><SPAN size="5">There 
    were patterns that tested better than AOR2 in Cropland/Woodland and AOR1 in Sandy 
    Desert, why not use those?</SPAN></span></b></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">While it 
    doesn’t show the (Experimental) Digital Woodland pattern on the chart that won the 
    Cropland/Woodland it could be similar to the Chinese Army&#39;s Woodland Digital pattern and for 
    obvious reasons you do not want to use something which is close to identical to 
    theirs or could cause confusion with the main Chinese Army.
    </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">The winner 
    of the Sandy Desert was the (Experimental) DCU Digital, however there is a large problem with 
    DCU (commonly referred to as 3 color desert) and DCU Digital, the colors 
    don’t work in the NIR or SWIR for night operations (there is no separation 
    of colors) and the base color your left with is a higher reflectance than 
    the background, the soldier is one brighter color than the entire background 
    (he/she shines like a light), so you have to eliminate both of these 
    patterns due to this issue. At least the UCP did have separation of colors 
    within these Night Vision spectrums. (5)</SPAN></span></p>

    <p><SPAN size="3"><span>You can fix this issue 
    with the addition of special polymers but this adds significant cost. (6)</span></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="5"><span>Digital 
    Pixel Patterns are Effective</span></SPAN></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">What we 
    also see from the Natick study is that <span>pixelated patterns</span> 
    still 
    dominate the top place finishers in all environments. Pixel’s within 
    camouflage are not a fad but a proven and effective form of camouflage. The 
    failure of UCP was not due to the pixelated pattern but the colors chosen for the 
    pattern. CADPAT/MARPAT/AOR1, AOR2 all come from the same print screens used 
    for UCP.Â  Â Â </SPAN></span></p>

    <p><span><SPAN size="3">The current 
    Phase IV U.S. Army Camouflage Improvement Effort was mandated by the U.S. 
    Congress when research on the U.S. Army’s current UCP (Universal Camouflage 
    Pattern) showed that it was ineffective in almost all environments tested. 
    It turns out that field trials were never carried out on UCP before it was 
    issued. </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><b><span><SPAN size="5">
    Where are we going from here and is it justified?</SPAN></span></b></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">So here 
    we are, late in the game, a decision has already been made and is about to 
    be announced (the Army is stating an announcement is due within the next few 
    weeks-many speculate this will come on the U.S. Army Birthday - June 14<sup>th</sup>, 
    which is when they have made announcements like this before) and people are 
    upset because they don’t understand why so much effort is being put into 
    this, why so much money is allocated to camouflage uniforms and gear, they 
    bring aesthetics into their opinion, they assume their ideas and concepts 
    are correct, when much of what I am reading on Social Media... has not been 
    based on facts.</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">The 
    Army has decided based on these previous studies that an All-In-One color scheme does 
    not effectively work around the world, thus they have decided on three major 
    environments for the Phase IV with each company submitting a family of 
    patterns to work in each one of the three environments. Each finalist needed 
    to equal or surpass the effectiveness of the baseline patterns; AOR1 for 
    Arid/Desert, Multicam for Transitional and AOR2 for Woodland/Tropical. All 
    of these patterns did extremely well within their respective environments, 
    but winner must somehow equal and outperform these three patterns. </SPAN>
    </span></p>
    <p><SPAN size="5"><b><span>T</span></b></SPAN><b><span><SPAN size="5">his 
    is just wasting more money? </SPAN></span></b></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">The 
    costs associated with changing are for the most part costs that will be 
    required regardless of changing or not, the average soldier goes through 
    four uniforms per year. The gear made from heavier Nylon does not wear out 
    that fast and so yes there will be some extra cost issues there.
    </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="5">Pattern Royalties</SPAN></b></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">The Phase IV program requested competing 
    companies to decide on a one lump royalty from the Military which range from below $100,000 to 
    over 6 million dollars between the four finalists, thus ending the pay as you print 
    royalty – the cost savings here for the U.S. military are substantial if the 
    winning patterns are used for more than one year. The company that wins will retain 
    the license for all commercial sales (not military) and thus is expected to 
    do well on their commercial royalties (in lieu of previous awarded 
    government [military] royalties).Â Â 
    </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><SPAN size="5">
    <span>With three different 
    environmental pattern uniforms, how many extra uniforms are they going to 
    issue the Army Soldiers?</span></SPAN></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">We have 
    heard that the transitional pattern (from the winning patterns – yet to be 
    announced) will be considered the garrison wear uniform as well as for 
    transitional environments, only if soldiers are deployed to Desert/Arid will 
    they be issued those Desert/Arid uniforms, if they are deployed to 
    Woodland/Tropical will they be issued just those Woodland/Tropical uniforms. 
    So soldiers will not be issued a library of three uniform colorations. They 
    will only be issued Arid and/or Woodland/Tropical uniforms if 
    they are deployed to those specific regions. </SPAN></span></p>
    <p><b><span><SPAN size="5">
    Conclusion:</SPAN></span></b></p>
    <p><span><SPAN size="3">What 
    we see with the U.S. Military research is not a repeated exercise in how many camouflage patterns can the 
    U.S. Military use at one time but an evolution of camouflage based on both 
    Subjective and Objective testing, which (for the most part) went from Olive 
    Drab into to the 1980’s to the BDU Woodland camouflage of over 20 years, to MARPAT in 2001 to the All-In-One concept with 
    All-Over-Brush in 2002 along with Multicam and UCP in 2004  
    back most recently to dedicated environments with AOR-1 and AOR-2. Many of these steps 
    showed improvement in effectiveness over the previous. Yes there were 
    mistakes and this contributed to some of the issues, I believe these mistake 
    have helped us understand more about camouflage than we otherwise would 
    have. The U.S. Army knowing that there was room to improve, conducted the largest camouflage study 
    ever on the 
    best patterns to find a long term effective camouflage which has culminated 
    with the Phase IV winner.</SPAN></span></p>
    <p><SPAN size="3"><span>It very 
    well could be that the Phase IV competing patterns were so close in daytime 
    testing (as they all use similar color palettes) that the decision came down 
    to the next most important factor which you cannot see; NIR and SWIR - how 
    the pattern works within the Night Vision and here we expect to see a big 
    difference between the four finalists based on what I have seen with color 
    and pattern choice among the competitors. DCU is an excellent Desert pattern 
    in the daytime it continues to score at the top of the testing, but it does 
    not work in the NIR and SWIR range, thus it has been eliminated from the 
    U.S. Military. </span></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="3"><span>So 
    before you decide that you know which pattern is best, based off of your 
    favorite looking, let the test results speak for themselves and it could be 
    that it&#39;s something that you&#39;re not seeing which has determined the winner.</span></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="3"><span>Do I 
    know who won? No, the Army has been very good about keeping this quiet.</span></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="3"><span>I do 
    believe that the winning pattern (which ever one wins) will provide 
    improvements to what is currently available and should ultimately save lives 
    of those who go into harms way on our behalf. </span></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="5">
    <span>US4CES (Pronounced U.S. 
    Forces)</span></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="3"><span>Many 
    people expected me to design something for Phase IV which was unique and I 
    believe I did just that (many were disappointed that it was not so different 
     
    in their view from what they had seen before), it was based off of 
    previous research showing what was working and what was not working. I 
    attempted to merge everything I had learned into the most effective 
    camouflage I could design based on the criteria put forward and while we may 
    not win on looks (the U.S. Army said from day one - &#34;this is not a fashion 
    show&#34;), I do believe that we have put forward a very effective solution for 
    the Visual (Day) and Infrared (Night) in all three environments. (7)</span></SPAN></p>
