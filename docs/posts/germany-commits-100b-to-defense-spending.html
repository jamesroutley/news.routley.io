    <h1>Germany commits €100B to defense spending</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Germany has announced a plan to prioritize military spending in light of Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. A &#34;special fund&#34; will be set up to better equip the Bundeswehr. </p><div>

<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a plan to <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/nato-how-useful-is-germanys-bundeswehr/a-60917464">beef up the German military</a> on Sunday, pledging €100 billion ($112.7 billion) of the 2022 budget for the armed forces and repeating his promise to reach the 2% of gross domestic product spending on defense in line with NATO demands.</p> <p>Scholz announced the new allocation in a speech during a special session of parliament on Germany&#39;s response to Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. He said the spending would include investments and armaments projects for the German military. </p> <p>Scholz also said <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-reversal-on-ukraine-weapons-policy-response-to-putins-aggression/a-60932652">Germany would supply the Ukrainian military with weaponry</a>, in a reversal of previous policy.</p>  <p>&#34;We need to support Ukraine in its hour of desperate need,&#34; the chancellor said. </p> <p>&#34;In attacking Ukraine, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin does not just want to eradicate a country from the world map, he is destroying the European security structure,&#34; Scholz told German lawmakers.</p> <h2>Why is the defense boost important?</h2> <p>&#34;It&#39;s clear we need to invest significantly more in the security of our country in order to protect our freedom and our democracy,&#39;&#39; Scholz said. </p> <p>Germany reported a record high in NATO defense spending for 2021, submitting a budget of €53 billion for the current year.</p> <p>That figure marks a 3.2% increase over the year before. In 2020, spending was capped at an estimated €51.4 billion.</p> <p>The €100 billion Scholz said would be dedicated for the armed forces this year is a one year boost though the move is significant, as Germany has often been criticized by the United States and other NATO allies for not investing enough in defense. </p>  <p>&#34;We are not alone in defending peace,&#34; Scholz said, adding Germany would be deploying more forces to NATO&#39;s eastern flank.</p> <p>Former German defense leaders have been publicly circumspect about the country&#39;s lack of military readiness since Putin gave a speech last Monday announcing his intentions and motivations for invading Ukraine.</p> <p>The decision to step up and meet NATO&#39;s target for defense spending of 2% of GDP came as <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-russia-policy-in-tatters-after-russian-invasion-of-ukraine/a-60874697"> bitter medicine to some lawmakers</a> , who could be heard reacted negatively to the chancellor&#39;s announcement during the Bundestag address.</p>  <p>ar/wmr (dpa,AP)</p>
