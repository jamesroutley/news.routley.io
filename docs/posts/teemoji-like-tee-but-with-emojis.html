<p>There is one episode of Seinfeld where George Costanza pitches his sitcom to Russell Darlymple who is the president of NBC.</p>
<p>Proposed sitcom is the show about nothing. Basically it’s a show where nothing happens and characters just do their everyday chores.</p>
<p>Perplexed Dalrymple asks: Well, why am I watching it?
George: It’s on TV.
Dalrymple: Not yet.</p>
<p><i>Not yet. </i>Such a powerful phrase. I wish we used it more.</p>
<p>It reminds me of Ukrainian anthem - “Ukraine is not dead yet.”</p>
<p>You see “not yet” allows us to refocus.</p>
<p>In Seinfeld Dalrymple takes George from future that is not there to the present moment.</p>
<p>In case of Ukraine the anthem can say “Ukraine exists now and is free now”, but that is not the point. <i>The point is to exist and be free in the future.</i></p>
<p>So “not yet” allows us to snap from rosy future back to reality or from reality to the negative version of the future.</p>
<p>In both cases it allows us to understand situation better and focus on the priorities.</p>
<p>It feels like we don’t use “not yet” enough in our modern Western world.</p>
<p>Think about it. We called United Nations organization - <i>United</i> Nations. What a terrible name. All those nations are not really united. There are so many disagreements and vetos and rarely do nations agree on something and act.</p>
<p>“Not yet United Nations” would be a better way to call that organization. It would imply that we have aspiration for the future and we didn’t achieve it yet.</p>
<p>We do the same a lot with products. Think about TurboTax or something. Is it really “turbo” at  this moment - not really, since you will still spend hours trying to report your taxes in the US.</p>
<p>Wishful thinking is good but at some point if the future never comes wishful thinking becomes almost like a parody at best and a lie at worst.</p>
<p>PS I just realized that Ukrainian anthem reminds me of Paul Graham essay <a href="https://paulgraham.com/aord.html">Default Dead or Default Alive?</a> Default Dead and “is not dead” are powerful tools to see the current state of things a bit differently.</p>
