    <h1>Proposal: JavaScript Structs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">Stage: 1</p>
<p dir="auto">Author: Shu-yu Guo (@syg)</p>
<p dir="auto">Champion: Shu-yu Guo (@syg), Ron Buckton (@rbuckton)</p>

<p dir="auto">This proposal introduces four (4) logical features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="#structs"><strong>Structs</strong></a>, or unshared structs, which are fixed-layout objects. They behave like <code>class</code> instances, with more restrictions that are beneficial for optimizations and analysis.</li>
<li><a href="#shared-structs"><strong>Shared Structs</strong></a>, which are further restricted structs that can be shared and accessed in parallel by multiple agents. They enable shared memory multithreading.</li>
<li><a href="#mutex-and-condition"><strong>Mutex and Condition</strong></a>, which are higher level abstractions for synchronizing access to shared memory.</li>
<li><a href="#unsafe-blocks"><strong>Unsafe Blocks</strong></a>, which are syntactic guardrails to lexically scope where racy accesses to shared structs are allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This proposal is intended to be minimal, but still useful by itself, without follow-up proposals.</p>
<p dir="auto">The motivations are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Enable new, high-performance applications to be written in JavaScript and on the web by unlocking shared memory multithreading.</li>
<li>Give developers an alternative to <code>class</code>es that favors a higher performance ceiling and statically analyzability over flexbility.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Like other shared memory features in JavaScript, it is high in expressive power and high in difficulty to use correctly. This proposal is both intended as an incremental step towards higher-level, easier-to-use (e.g. data-race free by construction) parallelism abstractions as well as an escape hatch for expert programmers who need the expressivity.</p>
<p dir="auto">The two design principles that this proposal follows for shared memory are:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Syntax that looks atomic ought to be atomic. (For example, the dot operator on shared structs should only access an existing field and does not tear.)</li>
<li>There are no references from shared objects to non-shared objects. The shared and non-shared heaps are conceptually separate, with direct references only going one way.</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">Unshared structs are a refinement on JavaScript <code>class</code>es. They are declarative, like classes, but layout of struct instances are fixed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Structs have the following properties:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>They are created with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/seal" rel="nofollow">integrity level sealed</a>. In other words, they have a fixed layout. Specifically, they cannot be extended with new properties. The value in their [[Prototype]] cannot change. Every syntactically declared field is writable, enumerable, and non-configurable.</li>
<li>They have &#34;one-shot initialization&#34;. Once a struct instance is accessible to JavaScript code, all their fields, including those of their superclasses, are already initialized to <code>undefined</code>.</li>
<li>Struct <code>constructor</code> methods have a usable <code>this</code> value, which is the one-shot initialize instance, on entry. As a result, return override is not expressible. <code>super()</code> is still allowed, but not required.</li>
<li>They can only extend other structs.</li>
<li>The struct constructor itself is also sealed.</li>
<li>Struct methods are non-generic. Their this value must be an instance of the struct or of a subclass.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Struct declarations use the <code>struct</code> keyword, and share their syntax with <code>class</code> declarations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some examples:</p>

<p dir="auto">Shared structs are structs with even more restricted behavior, so as to make them amenable to be shared between different agents. Their fields can be accessed in parallel by multiple agents.</p>
<p dir="auto">Shared structs, in addition to the properties listed for structs above, have the following additional properties:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>They can only extend other shared structs.</li>
<li>They have a <code>null</code> prototype.</li>
<li>They cannot contain instance methods or instance private names.</li>
<li>Their instances can be communicated to other agents without copying.</li>
<li>Their fields can only reference primitives or other shared structs. That is, they cannot point to unshared values.</li>
<li>They cannot be frozen, because that would change their shape, which must be immutable to be amenable for sharing.</li>

<p dir="auto">Correct multithreaded programs are difficult to write, because races are subtle and difficult to reason about. To decrease the likelihood of incorrect programs, accesses to shared structs are only allowed when lexically contained with in an <code>unsafe { }</code> block. Note that SharedArrayBuffer access remains allowed in all contexts for backwards compatibilty.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>unsafe</code> keyword is a clear signal of intent that a developer is choosing to work with shared memory multithreaded code. The presence of an <code>unsafe</code> block is an indication to code reviewers that special care must be taken during review. It also is acts as a syntactic marker that future tooling (linters, type checkers, etc.) could use to identify data races.</p>
<p dir="auto">An <code>unsafe {}</code> block is otherwise treated the same as a normal Block. Its only distinction is that it explicitly labels code within the block as potentially containing non-thread-safe (e.g., &#34;unsafe&#34;) code. The general expectation is that any thread safety concerns should be addressed by the developer as control flow exits the unsafe block. For example, you could utilize using to synchronize access to a shared struct via a lock:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="shared struct Counter {
  value = 0;
}

// normal JS code, outside of an &#34;unsafe&#34; context
const ctr = new Counter(); // allocations allowed
assertThrows(() =&gt; ctr.value = 1); // error (writes shared memory)
assertThrows(() =&gt; ctr.value);     // error (reads shared memory)

// &#34;unsafe&#34; JS code
unsafe {
  ctr.value = 1; // ok
  ctr.value;     // ok
}

function incrementCounter(ctr, mutex) {
  unsafe {
    using lck = Atomics.Mutex.lock(mutex);
    ctr.value++;

<p dir="auto">Here, when the control enters the <code>unsafe</code> block, we allocate a lock against the provided mutex via a <code>using</code> declaration. As control exits the <code>unsafe</code> block, the lock tracked by using is released.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>unsafe</code> keyword is a syntactic marker that applies to lexically scoped reads and writes of the fields of a shared struct instance. Within an <code>unsafe</code> block, any lexically scoped accesses are permitted, even if they are nested within another function declared in the same block. This special lexical context shares some surface level similarities with the lexical scoping rules for private names, or the runtime semantics of &#34;use strict&#34;.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since <code>unsafe</code> is lexically scoped, it does not carry over to the invocation of functions declared outside of an <code>unsafe</code> context:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="function increment(ctr) {
  ctr.value++; // error due to illegal read/write of `ctr.value` outside of `unsafe`
}
unsafe {
  const ctr = new Counter();

  <span>increment</span><span>(</span><span>ctr</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Thread-safe code may execute <code>unsafe</code> code without restriction, and <code>unsafe</code> code may do likewise. As <code>unsafe</code> already indicates a transition boundary between thread-safe and <code>unsafe</code> code, there is no need to declare all calling code <code>unsafe</code> as you might need to do for <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>. The <code>unsafe</code> keyword itself does not entail any implicit synchronization or coordination as that would be in opposition to our performance goals. Instead, the onus is on developers to be cognizant of thread safety concerns when they define an <code>unsafe</code> block. As such, a developer can choose the coordination mechanism that best suits the needs of their application, be that a <code>Mutex</code>, a lock-free concurrent deque, etc.</p>

<div dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Attaching methods to shared structs</h3></div>
<p dir="auto">Because functions are deeply unshareable, shared structs currently do not have methods. However, this is a severe ergonomic pain point. It is also counter to encapsulation, which may have real harm in encouraging more thread-unsafe code. The current direction being explored to enable methods, which is undergoing discussion, is to give shared structs the following additional features:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>A per-Realm prototype object, which is an ordinary object and thus can contain methods. This corresponds to making the [[Prototype]] internal field on shared structs thread-local storage.</li>
<li>A correlation mechanism to correlate evaluations of the same &#34;logical&#34; shared struct declaration across different agents.</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/blob/master/proposals/gc/Overview.md">WasmGC proposal</a> adds fixed layout, garbage-collected objects to Wasm. While the details of the type system of these objects are yet to be nailed down, interoperability with JavaScript is a requirement.</p>
<p dir="auto">WasmGC objects have opaque storage and are not aliased by linear memory, so they cannot be exposed as all Wasm memory is exposed today via <code>ArrayBuffer</code>s. We propose structs to be the reflection of WasmGC objects in JS.</p>
<p dir="auto">WasmGC objects exposed to JS should behave the same as structs, modulo extra type checking that WasmGC require that JS structs do not. JS structs is also a good foundation for reflecting into Wasm as WasmGC objects, but that is currently left as future work as it may need a typed field extensions to be worthwhile.</p>
<p dir="auto">Further, WasmGC itself will eventually have multithreading. It behooves us to maintain a single memory model between JavaScript and Wasm as we have today, even with higher-level object abstractions.</p>

<p dir="auto">This proposal does not intend to explore the space of overlaying structured views on binary data in an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>. This is a requirement arising from the desire for WasmGC integration, and WasmGC objects are similarly opaque.</p>
<p dir="auto">Structured overlays are fundamentally about aliasing memory, which we feel is both a different problem domain, has significant performance downsides, and sufficiently solvable today in userland. For example, see <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/buffer-backed-object">buffer-backed objects</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Notably, structured overlays in JavaScript essentially involves allocating unshared wrappers <em>per agent</em>. If an application has shared state with a complex structure, such as a large object graph, recreating that structure via a set of wrappers per agent negates the memory use benefits of <em>shared</em> memory. Structured overlays would work for specific application architectures where the structure of the shared state itself is simple, like a byte buffer.</p>


<p dir="auto">Structs are declared with fixed layout up front. Engines should make an immutable shape for such objects. Optimizers can optimize field accesses without worrying about deopts.</p>
<div dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Shared structs: make sure fields are pointer-width and aligned</h3></div>
<p dir="auto">Shared structs should store fields such that underlying architectures can perform atomic stores and loads. This usually eans the fields should be at least pointer-width and aligned.</p>
<div dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Shared structs: strings will be difficult</h3></div>
<p dir="auto">Except for strings, sharing primitives in the engine is usually trivial, especially for NaN-boxing implementations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Strings in production engines have in-place mutation to transition representation in order to optimize for different use ases (e.g. ropes, slices, canonicalized, etc). Sharing strings will likely be the most challenging part of the mplementation.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is possible to support sharing strings by copying-on-sharing, but may be too slow. If possible, lockfree mplementations of in-place mutations above is ideal.</p>

<p dir="auto">Production engines use moving garbage collectors, such as generational collectors and compacting collectors. If JS ynchronization primitives are implemented under the hood as OS-level synchronization primitives, those primitives most ikely depend on an unchanging address in memory and are <em>not</em> moving GC-safe.</p>
<p dir="auto">Engines can choose to pin these objects and make them immovable.</p>
<p dir="auto">Engines can also choose to implement synchronization primitives entirely in userspace. For example, WebKit&#39;s <code>ParkingLot</code>](<a href="https://webkit.org/blog/6161/locking-in-webkit/" rel="nofollow">https://webkit.org/blog/6161/locking-in-webkit/</a>) is a userspace implementation of Linux futexes. This may have other benefits, such as improved and tuneable performance.</p>
