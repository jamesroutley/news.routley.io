<h3 data-block-key="vvgyw">Ethics</h3><p data-block-key="627o9">I have some qualms about using Whisper.</p><p data-block-key="1ujtd">Whisper was <a href="https://openai.com/blog/whisper/">&#34;trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web&#34;</a>. Collected how? Did the speakers agree to this collection? Does Whisper claim that the legitimacy of its data collection stems from a clause buried in a clickthrough End User License Agreement that does not have any intelligible relationship to genuine human consent? Was copyright infringed? I don&#39;t know, and I did try to check.</p><p data-block-key="eickt">I know that there are people who make their livings captioning or transcribing audio. I have friends and acquaintances (<a href="http://www.keffy.com/hire-me/">example</a>) who make money doing so. I predict the easy availability of Whisper will shrink the market for their work. Now that I know how to use Whisper, I am using it to transcribe many pieces of audio that I would not have paid someone to transcribe, and assuming Whisper performs well on even bad-quality audio, I&#39;m likely to use it instead of paying someone in the future, although that hasn&#39;t come up yet.</p><p data-block-key="dph2e">But:</p><p data-block-key="9i0n">Whisper is free of cost and the code is open source (the authors do actually accept patches; <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper/pull/315">I landed one</a>). When I use it, it does not send data back home; me using it does not directly help train the next iteration or tell a corporate parent about things people said in private.</p><p data-block-key="eup4a">Transcripts and captions make audio more accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing people, people with ADHD, people with audio processing issues, and people who are learning English. And publishing polished transcripts makes search, linking, and citation far easier.</p><p data-block-key="3rueh">And I&#39;m influenced here by <a href="https://www.oblomovka.com/wp/2022/12/12/on-stable-diffusion/">what Danny O&#39;Brien says about Stable Diffusion</a>, a somewhat similar tool. It&#39;s worth reading the whole (short) post about relative power, copyright, capabilities, and empowerment, which ends:</p><blockquote data-block-key="6l77f">Artists should get paid; and they shouldn’t have to pay for the privilege of building on our common heritage. They should be empowered to create amazing works from new tools, just as they did with the camera, the television, the sampler and the VHS recorder, the printer, the photocopier, Photoshop, and the Internet. A 4.2GiB file isn’t a heist of every single artwork on the Internet, and those who think it is are the ones undervaluing their own contributions and creativity. It’s an amazing summary of what we know about art, and everyone should be able to use it to learn, grow, and create.</blockquote><p data-block-key="38kvc">How should I decide, not just about this, but about other tools of this type?</p><p data-block-key="cl2h5">Several people I know (such as <a href="https://www.openml.fyi/transparency-and-other-rules-2022-11-21/">Luis Villa</a>) are working on how to think about these kinds of ethical choices in the absence of clear, canonical, and thoughtful guidance from religious and spiritual leaders, trusted charities, governments, et alia. We have some guidance from ethicists and philosophers on whether to <i>make</i> particular kinds of tools (along the lines of the <a href="https://techautonomy.org/">Declaration of Digital Autonomy</a>); I am still looking for frameworks for deciding which tools to <i>use</i> (along the lines of <a href="https://www.franklinstreetstatement.org/">the Franklin Street Statement on Freedom and Network Services</a>).</p><p data-block-key="bp97j"><a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/feb/03/github-copilot-copyleft-gpl/">Software Freedom Conservancy has shared its thinking regarding GitHub Copilot</a>, which is an aid to writing software; their focus is particularly on &#34;AI-assisted authorship of software using copylefted training sets&#34;; they advise against using Copilot, and I haven&#39;t used it.</p><p data-block-key="a79du">More generally, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Aug/29/stable-diffusion/">Simon Willison has popularized a &#34;vegan&#34; analogy</a> for people who abstain from using these kinds of machine learning-trained tools. I want to dig into that a little more. Some people are vegans for personal health reasons, some as part of an organized political movement trying to improve animal welfare or working to reduce environmental damage, some as part of an organized movement aiming to decrease harm to <i>humans</i> (from factory farming, etc.), some because reverence/purity/disgust/sacredness make them viscerally averse to eating animal-based food, and some people want to fit in with vegan peers -- and I&#39;ve probably missed other reasons, and some folks have multiple reasons, and some people are just trying it out of curiosity.</p><p data-block-key="4lud0">So I&#39;m reviewing these rationales to check whether they apply here.</p><p data-block-key="1627j"><b>Personal health</b>: Will it harm me to use Whisper? Possibly. For instance, if I start to trust the output and let my guard down -- as I likely will over time, when I&#39;m in a hurry -- then I could read a biased inaccurate transcription and assume it&#39;s correct, and that could lead me to believe something false. There&#39;s also a tiny chance that courts could decide that, by publishing a Whisper-generated transcript, I am infringing the copyright of those who wrote the transcripts that researchers trained Whisper on, and then the courts could penalize me for that. I consider that risk negligible.</p><p data-block-key="efm6m"><b>Environmental advocacy</b>: Is there an organized political movement asking people to boycott Whisper as part of a push for carbon reduction or a similar environmental effort? If so, I&#39;m unaware of it, but please let me know if there is one. Whisper exists in the world whether I use it or not, and -- unlike with a paid or ad-supported commercial product -- my usage does not increase the likelihood it will continue. Me as a single person choosing not to use it would not be like a boycott and would not affect OpenAI&#39;s choices.</p><p data-block-key="52p9n"><b>Reducing harm to/exploitation of other humans</b>: As researchers collected data to use to train Whisper, they probably swept in data that the authors didn&#39;t mean to offer for that usage. As with the previous point, I am unaware of an advocacy group that asks me to boycott Whisper as part of a push for better consent standards for data collection that will be used for machine learning training. In the world of visual art, artists are banding together to campaign for limitations on scrapers using their art as fodder to train AI on (in particular, <a href="https://bixbythemartian.tumblr.com/post/700727788807864320">here&#39;s a thread about protest against a planned change by DeviantArt</a>). Please let me know if there is something like this regarding captions and transcripts.</p><p data-block-key="3rjlb">What about the decrease in work available for transcribers and captioners, or that work getting worse? Conversations <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/196808/Speech-to-text-with-Whisper">on MetaFilter</a> and elsewhere have helped me understand that there&#39;s a lot of nuance here, because, for instance, medical transcribers already do a lot of work with editing and fixing computer-generated transcripts rather than doing the whole transcription from scratch. There&#39;s a related ethical question here which is: under what circumstances should we take extraordinary steps to retain and sustain a particular occupation beyond what the market would do on solely economic grounds? Perhaps there&#39;s an argument that this is a skill we need to preserve in case we have need of it in the future, or there&#39;s a general social welfare argument about keeping people who cannot easily find another career from falling into poverty. Again, if there is a group (especially a workers&#39; guild) asking me to boycott Whisper for the sake of transcribers, I&#39;d like to know about that, but I don&#39;t yet.</p><p data-block-key="dlsd0"><b>Reverence</b>: I have tried to be assiduous in responsibly reusing clip art, music, etc. in work that I publish, partly for cerebral reasons but also partly because of a deep-seated, beyond-rational respect for creative work and a visceral distaste for broken attribution chains. The Creative Commons framework makes this easier, of course. When I reflect on the people who made transcripts that researchers trained Whisper on, and on how I reuse a derivative of their work using Whisper, I have a mix of emotions, including gratitude, worry, and a kind of eerieness, but not the kind of NO NO NO gut-level reaction that stops me from using some other products. I&#39;m guessing people often have more gut reactions to AI-prompted art -- artifacts laden with emotional meaning -- than to functional tools like transcripts. And, as my writing partner <a href="https://jacobian.org/">Jacob</a> mentioned as I was discussing this with him, programmers who identify with their work a lot will have pretty visceral feelings about tools like Copilot.</p><p data-block-key="6iqa8"><b>Fitting in</b>: Within the subset of my social circles where people have opinions on machine learning tools, people are split regarding really enjoying or really despising AI-prompted/generated visual art, and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">a GPT-enabled chatbot</a>. I haven&#39;t read anyone making arguments against using Whisper yet, and some people I know and like use it, but I also feel bad that my friends who make money from transcribing audio will know I am sometimes using this alternative.</p><p data-block-key="7q5f8">Given this assessment I am pretty sure I&#39;m going to continue to use Whisper. How ought I use it and similar classification tools responsibly? I figure I should try to be on my guard about inaccuracies, especially biased ones. If I publish output, I should be <a href="https://www.openml.fyi/transparency-and-other-rules-2022-11-21/">transparent</a> and acknowledge the provenance of the transcription, sharing authorship in the metadata. Maybe I should make sure to tell people I know about it, especially those who currently make captions and transcripts manually, especially those who do so for money, so they have a shot at automating the tedious work and spending their time on more valuable things. And I should try to be aware of social movements that articulate ethical frameworks for using or abjuring these tools, in case I ought to change my mind.</p>
