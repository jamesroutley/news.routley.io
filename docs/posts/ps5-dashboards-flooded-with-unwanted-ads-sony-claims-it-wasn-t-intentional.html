    <h1>PS5 Dashboards Flooded with Unwanted Ads–Sony Claims It Wasn&#39;t Intentional</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-47277" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope=""><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Looks like Sony’s doing a bit of damage control—again. So, if you’ve been seeing your PS5 dashboard suddenly littered with ads after the latest update, you’re definitely not alone. But don’t sweat it, Sony says it wasn’t supposed to happen. Yep, they’re blaming it on a “tech error.”</p><h2>Here’s what went down Yesterday</h2><p>After the PS5 system update, players started noticing their Game Hubs getting swarmed with ads.</p><p>You’d be minding your own business, just hovering over a game like <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em> or <em>Space Marine 2</em>, and boom!—in-your-face promos for games you already own.</p><p>Naturally, gamers were not amused. The internet had a field day, and Sony quickly pulled the plug on the ad flood. Crisis averted… sort of.</p><p>Now, I get why everyone thought this was intentional.</p><p>Ads creeping into our dashboards? That’s nothing new—just ask the Xbox crowd, who’ve been dealing with full-screen ads for a while now. And let’s not forget, the PS5 still doesn’t have those awesome dynamic themes we all loved on the PS4.</p><p>I mean, c’mon, Sony—what gives? So, yeah, when people saw these ads, it seemed like just another way to bombard us with more stuff we didn’t ask for.</p><p>But hey, according to Sony, it was all just a big ol’ bug. They didn’t <em>mean</em> to flood your screen with ads (at least this time).</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A tech error with the Official News feature on the PS5 console has since been resolved. There have been no changes to the way game news is displayed on PS5.</p>— Ask PlayStation (@AskPlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1840877005396722121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">September 30, 2024</a></blockquote> </div><figcaption>Sony’s tweet about this “Tech Error”</figcaption></figure><p>They’ve now reversed that part of the update, so we can all breathe a little easier—for now. PSN’s back online too, after a brief outage earlier in the day.</p><p>I don’t know about you, but I definitely don’t need a constant reminder of what games I own and what i need to buy—my backlog already haunts me enough!</p><p>And while Sony claims this was just a glitch, who’s to say what’s coming next? Is this just the beginning of a future filled with dashboard clutter?</p><p>I sure hope not, but at this point, nothing Sony does surprises me.</p><p>So yeah, fingers crossed that these “tech errors” don’t become a regular thing, because if I see another ad pop up for something I already bought, I might just throw my controller through the screen.</p></div></div></article></div>
