        <p>
          Last week, I created a chatbot that answers questions about AI safety.
          You can try it out here:
          <a href="https://ai-safety-conversational-agent.thomasbroadley.com/">https://ai-safety-conversational-agent.thomasbroadley.com/</a>
          The source code is
          <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/ai-safety-conversational-agent">on GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made the chatbot because of a
          <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SLRLuiuDykfTdmesK/speed-running-everyone-through-the-bad-alignement-bingo">bounty</a>
          on LessWrong, a website about rationality, AI safety, and existential
          risk. The chatbot answers easy questions about AI safety, such as
          &#34;what is AI safety?&#34;. It can also answer common objections like &#34;I
          don&#39;t think AGI would want to kill humans&#34;.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make the chatbot, I used
          <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/chat-langchain"><code>chat-langchain</code></a>, a starter kit for building chatbots with large language models
          (LLMs). First, <code>chat-langchain</code> uses
          <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain">LangChain</a> (a
          toolset for making apps with LLMs) to turn a set of documents into an
          embedding. The embedding represents each document as a relatively
          small vector (for example, 768 dimensions). When someone sends a
          question to the bot, a FastAPI backend uses the embedding to quickly
          look up documents related to the question. Then, it uses the documents
          to build a GPT-3 prompt and generates an answer through the OpenAI
          API.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made the bot in only a couple of hours. I forked
          <code>chat-langchain</code> and configured LangChain to ingest the
          FAQs from <a href="https://aisafety.info">aisafety.info</a>. Then, I
          generated an OpenAI API key. After that, the bot pretty much worked on
          my laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hardest part was making the bot work on my VPS. Iâ€™d forgotten how
          to use Apache and Systemd. Luckily, ChatGPT helped me set them up.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          This project is cheap to host so far. Testing the bot cost less than 1
          USD. However, GPT-3 generation requests cost about 1 cent each. If
          many people use the bot, this could become more expensive.
        </p>
        <p>Please try the bot and give me feedback!</p>
