    <h1>Apple Shares Full iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro Repair Manuals</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div role="main" id="maincontent"><article expanded="true"><div><div data-io-article-url="/2024/09/20/iphone-16-repair-manual/"><p>Following today&#39;s launch of the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, Apple has shared repair manuals for the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120652">iPhone 16</a>, the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120662">iPhone 16 Plus</a>, the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120803">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, and the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120828">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. The repair manuals provide technical instructions on replacing genuine Apple parts in the ‌iPhone 16‌ models, and Apple says the information is intended for &#34;individual technicians&#34; that have the &#34;knowledge, experience, and tools&#34; that are necessary to repair electronic devices.</p>

<p>Compared to prior <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus are easier to repair. Apple is using an electric battery removal process, and the steps for accessing a battery to replace it are outlined in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120642">separate support document</a>. Per Apple&#39;s instructions, a 9-volt battery and 9-volt battery clips can be applied to the ‌iPhone 16‌ battery to remove the adhesive that holds it in place.</p>
<p>Note that the simpler electricity-based battery removal process is limited to the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus. For the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and Pro Max, Apple is using standard adhesive tabs that need to be carefully pulled to release the battery.</p>
<p>Apple&#39;s instructions for all of the battery repairs include expensive equipment like an ‌iPhone‌ battery press to put a replacement battery back in place. The cost of the tools required for device repair and the cost of genuine components make self repair almost as expensive as getting a repair from an Apple retail location or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, so these manuals are really aimed at independent repair shops rather than individual consumers.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/18/iphone-16-repairability-changes/">made other changes</a> to the ‌iPhone 16‌ models this year to improve repairability, enabling on-device configuration for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> camera, allowing LiDAR Scanner repair, and offering support for swapping the TrueDepth camera modules between ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models.</p>
<p>In addition to offering repair instructions, Apple&#39;s manuals provide some insight into the internal structure of the new iPhones that we often don&#39;t see until there <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-16-pro-teardown-video/">are device teardowns</a>. The ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌, for example, has a metal casing for the battery, a change made for thermal reasons, and both Pro models have new casing structure that improves heat dissipation.</p>
