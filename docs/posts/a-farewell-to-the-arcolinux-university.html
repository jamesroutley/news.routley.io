<p>After eight years of dedication to the ArcoLinux project and the broader Linux community, the time has come for me to step away.</p>
<p>This decision wasn’t made lightly. But as I approach 60, I’ve found myself with less energy, less focus, and making small mistakes that remind me I’m no longer at my peak. I want to leave ArcoLinux <strong>while it’s still strong</strong>, and while I can look back with pride at everything we’ve accomplished together.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>What We’ve Achieved Together</h3>
<p>Since day one, ArcoLinux has stood for <strong>education, experimentation, and empowerment</strong>. I didn’t just want to build a distro — I wanted to help people <em>learn</em> Linux, <em>love</em> Linux, and <em>grow</em> into confident users, tinkerers, and developers.</p>
<p>Here are just a few milestones I’m proud of:</p>
<ul>
<li>🎓 <strong>Over 5,000 educational videos</strong> on YouTube — covering everything from Arch basics to advanced configurations.</li>
<li>🧰 The creation of <strong>ArcoInstall</strong>, a flexible and evolving installer experience for learning-by-doing.</li>
<li>🏗️ <strong>Carli (Custom Arch Linux ISO)</strong> – a full educational project teaching you how to build your own Arch-based ISO from scratch.</li>
<li>🌐 <strong>ALCI (Arch Linux Calamares Installer)</strong> – demonstrating how to combine Arch power with graphical simplicity.</li>
<li>🌀<strong> ArcoPlasma, ArcoNet, ArcoPro, Ariser</strong> – each tailored to different use cases and learning paths.</li>
<li>💬 Countless hours spent on forums, Discord, Telegram, and email, helping users solve problems, understand systems, and grow.</li>
<li>🧪 Encouraging people to try <strong>Bspwm, i3, Chadwm, Xmonad, Qtile, AwesomeWM</strong>, and many more tiling window managers.</li>
<li>📦 Teaching how to build <strong>AUR packages</strong>, create your own <strong>repos</strong>, and dive deep into <strong>pacman</strong>, <strong>zsh</strong>, <strong>bash</strong>, <strong>systemd</strong>, and beyond.</li>
</ul>
<p>We weren’t just maintaining a distro — <strong>we were teaching a mindset</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Why It’s Time to Step Back</h3>
<p>Aging is humbling. As I near 60, I’ve come to realize I simply don’t have the same mental sharpness or stamina I used to. I catch myself making little mistakes — the kind that matter when you’re maintaining an ecosystem with this many moving parts.</p>
<p>Rather than let that diminish the quality of ArcoLinux, I choose to leave it <strong>while it’s still stable, respected, and valuable.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<h3>What Comes Next?</h3>
<p>I don’t have big plans. I want to slow down, enjoy life, and maybe tinker with Linux just for fun again — without the pressure of running a large project.</p>
<p>The code, the videos, the documentation — <strong>they’ll remain online</strong> for others to learn from, fork, or remix. I truly hope others will take inspiration from it. Just as I was inspired by the community years ago.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Thank You</h3>
<p>To every user, contributor, tester, question-asker, and silent learner: <strong>thank you</strong>.</p>
<p>You kept me going on the hard days. You turned this from a solo effort into a true community.</p>
<p>Please… keep experimenting. Keep breaking things. Keep learning. And always:</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>ArcoLinux Team – ArcoLinux Betatesters</p></div>
