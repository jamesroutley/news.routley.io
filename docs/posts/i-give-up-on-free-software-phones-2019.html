    <h1>I give up on free software phones (2019)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
			<p>For over a year I have used a Google-free smart phone, at first with just
<a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a> and later with <a href="https://lineage.microg.org/">LineageOS+MicroG</a>. It was a nice
experiment but my phone was causing too much trouble and in the end I got
fed up and bought a new phone (Samsung Galaxy S10e). I hope one day to
have a free phone again (maybe if the Librem 5 will succeed) but
currently there isn’t a real alternative that is worth the sacrifice.</p>
<p>But why is it that hard to have a free<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> version of Android? It’s
because Google have slowly made it harder to have alternative versions
of Android without Google and made consumer think of Android as
AOSP+Play Services when in reality Play Services were not an integral
part of Android. The first example that I have of this is a <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/GlobalSearch/+/592150ac00086400415afe936d96f04d3be3ba0c">commit by
Anonymous Coward</a> that removed the ability to choose a search engine
in GlobalSearch and would crash if Google is not installed.</p>
<p>Since then, Google continued to slowly removing or deprecating features
that were not dependent on Google’s proprietary software. The Play Store
for example was not a big part of Android ten years ago. In a book about
Android from 2011<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> the author wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One way in which Android is quite different from other platforms is
the distribution of its apps. On most other platforms, such as iPhone,
a single vendor holds a monopoly over the distribution of
applications. On Android, there are many different stores, or markets.
Each market has its own set of policies with respect to what is
allowed, how the revenue is split, and so on. As such, Android is much
more of a free market space in which vendors compete for business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That paragraph did not age well, today it will be quite hard to find an
Android phone without the Play Store outside of China. Not because there
are no alternative stores but because you must install Play Store if you
want Google Play Services.</p>
<p>The result of tying Android with Google Play Services and the Google
play store is that application developers won’t target AOSP, they will
target AOSP+Play Services. The tying also allow Google to move features
from AOSP to a proprietary alternative without anyone caring (or even
cheering for it), there is no AOSP Calendar but instead you are supposed
to use Google Calendar.</p>
<p>Those examples are just the tip of the iceberg, Moovit for example
refused to work at all without the Play Services and Telegram showed me
a constant notification just so it will be able to send me push
notifications<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. All of those problems together made me install MicroG
which was a nice idea but in practice crashed a lot and didn’t support
some Play Services APIs. MicroG wasn’t the saviour I needed so I decided
to just buy a new phone<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
