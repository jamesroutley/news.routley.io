<p>A friend of mine had been using <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/beeper-mini-on-android-claims-to-have-reverse-engineered-imessage-compatibility/">Beeper&#39;s iMessage-for-Android app, Beeper Mini</a> to keep up on group chats where she was the only Android user. It worked great until last Friday, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/beeper-minis-imessage-app-for-android-is-broken-possibly-by-apple/">it didn&#39;t work at all</a>.</p>
<p>What stung her wasn&#39;t the return to being the Android interloper in the chats again. It wasn&#39;t the resulting lower-quality images, loss of encryption, and strange &#34;Emphasized your message&#34; reaction texts. It was losing messages during the outage and never being entirely certain they had been sent or received. There was a gathering on Saturday, and she had to double-check with a couple people about the details after showing up inadvertently early at the wrong spot.</p>
<p>That kind of grievance is why, after Apple on Wednesday appeared to have blocked what Beeper described as &#34;~5% of Beeper Mini users&#34; from accessing iMessages, both co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1735131934484029914">Eric Migicovksy</a> and the app told users <a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1735315504880123995">they understood if people wanted out</a>. The app had already suspended its plans to charge customers $1.99 per month, following the first major outage. But this was something more about &#34;how ridiculously annoying this uncertainty is for our users,&#34; Migicovsky posted.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Fighting on two fronts</h2>
<p>But Beeper would keep working to ensure access and keep fighting on other fronts. Migicovsky pointed to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/googles-android-app-store-monopoly-violates-antitrust-law-jury-finds/">Epic&#39;s victory at trial against Google&#39;s Play Store</a> (&#34;big tech&#34;) as motivation. &#34;We have a chance. We&#39;re not giving up.&#34; Over the weekend, Migicovsky reposted shows of support from Senators <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1734983766492184886">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) and <a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1734363711769546873">Amy Klobuchar</a> (D-Minn.), who have focused on reigning in and regulating large technology company&#39;s powers.</p>
<p>Apple previously issued a (somewhat uncommon) statement about Beeper&#39;s iMessage access, stating that it &#34;took steps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage.&#34; Citing privacy, security, and spam concerns, Apple stated it would &#34;continue to make updates in the future&#34; to protect users. Migicovsky previously denied to Ars that Beeper used &#34;fake credentials&#34; or in any way made iMessages less secure.</p>
<p>I asked Migicovsky by direct message if, given Apple&#39;s stated plan to continually block it, there could ever be a point at which Beeper&#39;s access was &#34;settled,&#34; or &#34;back up and running,&#34; as he put it in his post on X (formerly Twitter). He wrote that it was up to the press and the community. &#34;If there&#39;s enough pressure on Apple, they will have to quit messing with us.&#34; &#34;Us,&#34; he clarified, meant both Apple&#39;s customers using iMessage and Android users trying to chat securely with iPhone friends.</p>
<p>&#34;That&#39;s who they&#39;re penalizing,&#34; he wrote. &#34;It&#39;s not a Beeper vs. Apple fight, it&#39;s Apple versus customers.&#34;</p>
