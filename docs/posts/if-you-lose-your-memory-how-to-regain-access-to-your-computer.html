        This is a tool that encrypts files and splits the decryption key among trusted friends
        using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing" target="_blank">Shamir&#39;s Secret Sharing</a>.
        For example, you can give pieces to 5 friends and require any 3 of them to cooperate to recover the key.
        No single friend can access your data alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each friend receives a self-contained bundle with <code>recover.html</code>—a browser-based tool that works
        offline, with no servers or internet required. If this website disappears, recovery still works.
      </p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>Your file is encrypted, the key is split into shares, and friends combine shares to recover it.</p>

      

      <p>Different friend combinations can recover the file (any 3 of 5)</p>

      <p>
          <strong>Your File</strong> → <strong>Encrypt</strong> → <strong>Split key into 5 shares</strong> → <strong>Distribute to friends</strong></p>

        <div>
          <h3>It is:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>An offline tool that runs in your browser</li>
            <li>A way to split a recovery key among friends</li>
            <li>Open source (Apache-2.0)</li>
            <li>Self-contained—recovery works without this site</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>It isn&#39;t:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A service or a company</li>
            <li>An account system or cloud product</li>
            <li>Something that stores your data anywhere</li>
            <li>A backup solution by itself</li>

      <h2>Try it in 2 minutes</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/eljojo/rememory/releases/latest/download/demo-bundles.zip">Download the demo bundles</a> (contains 3 sample bundles)</li>
        <li>Open <code>bundle-alice/recover.html</code> in your browser</li>
        <li>Add Bob&#39;s and Carol&#39;s shares (drag their README.txt files onto the page)</li>
        <li>Watch the automatic decryption when threshold is met</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is the best way to understand what your friends would experience during a real recovery.</p>

      <h2>On trust and verification</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The code is open source—you can <a href="https://github.com/eljojo/rememory" target="_blank">read it on GitHub</a></li>
        <li>There&#39;s a <a href="https://github.com/eljojo/rememory/blob/main/docs/security-audit.md" target="_blank">self-audit document</a> explaining the cryptographic choices</li>
        <li>Everything runs locally in your browser; your files don&#39;t leave your device</li>
        <li>Try the demo bundles first to see exactly how it works before using it with real secrets</li>
        <li>Uses <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/age" target="_blank">age</a> for encryption—a well-regarded modern tool</li>

      <h2>Why I built this</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted a way to ensure trusted friends could access important files if something happened to me—without
        trusting any single person or service with everything. Shamir&#39;s Secret Sharing seemed like the right approach,
        but I couldn&#39;t find a tool that gave friends a simple, self-contained way to recover files together.
        So I built one. I&#39;m sharing it in case it&#39;s useful to others.
