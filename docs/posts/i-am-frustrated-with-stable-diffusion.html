    <h1>I am frustrated with Stable Diffusion</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I really want to make a game along the line of Myst.  I have been
collecting puzzles for years, and I have almost enough.  I am flexible
about the visual style.  I’ve considered making sets out of lego, or
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzikIwPPle0">cardboard</a>, or cut
paper.  And I’ve considered AI-generated art.</p>

<p>I am willing to accept compromises on precision: If the palm tree ends
up on the left side instead of the right, that’s OK.  It’s even OK if
it’s a date palm when I visualized a coconut palm.  I might even
settle for a willow.</p>

<p>But it’s important that it looks like a place you could be in, and
that the objects look like objects that could physically exist.  This
is why I’m so frustrated with Stable Diffusion.  It’s so close to
giving me what I want.  But it’s not there yet, because it does not
comprehend physical objects.</p>

<p>I asked for a dock at the bottom of a cliff. It gave me some stairs at
the bottom of a cliff (admittedly, some of the other images had some
vaguely dock-like things, but none had the perspective I wanted:
almost nobody takes a picture of a dock from the water).</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/dock1.jpg" alt="dock1" id="dock1"/></p>

<p>Ok, the stairs look great — I’ll just paint in where I want a dock,
and have it clean up that part. (I also rearranged the composition a
little to make room).</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/dock2.jpg" alt="dock2" id="dock2"/></p>

<p>Here’s what I got:</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/dock3.jpg" alt="dock3" id="dock3"/></p>

<p>OK, that’s sort of a dock.  Like, there’s nowhere to tie up your boat,
and it’s got weird protrusions, and it’s somehow below the waterline,
but I can work with that.  I’ll erase the protrusions, fix the rear,
and add some posts.</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/dock4.jpg" alt="dock4" id="dock4"/></p>

<p>Then I’ll tell Stable diffusion to just clean up those parts:</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/dock5.jpg" alt="dock5" id="dock5"/></p>

<p>Oh look, it decided to put a weird vertical line in the middle of my
dock.  Why?  And also, it keeps wanting to fuck up the right side of
the dock.  OK, I’ll clean it up with the clone tool:</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/dock6.jpg" alt="dock6" id="dock6"/></p>

<p>Sure, we lost a post, but at this point, I don’t care.  Stable diffusion,
please clean up the clonejunk….</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/dock7.jpg" alt="dock7" id="dock7"/></p>

<p>No!  You fucked up the right side of my dock again! Don’t you know how
solid objects work?</p>

<p>Aargh, I give up.  I’ll just hire
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Giraud">Mœbius</a> to do the artwork
for my game.  What’s that you say?  He’s dead?  Noooooo!</p>

<p>(Yes, I could pay an artist to make art for the game.  But I’m not yet
good enough at game marketing for this to make sense: The original,
1990s Myst had 2,500 images, which would cost me more than I expect to
make this year.  Also, it would take an absurd amount of time.  So
I won’t do that … yet.)</p>
