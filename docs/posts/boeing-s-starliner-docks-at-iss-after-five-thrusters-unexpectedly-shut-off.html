Five of the spacecraft thrusters failed during its approach, and four were subsequently recovered. As a result, NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore had to assume manual control of the crew capsule for a while before it went back into its autonomous mode. The capsule finally docked with the ISS at 1:34 p.m. ET following a nail-biting journey.</p><p><strong>Update: June 6, 1:27 p.m. ET: </strong>Starliner’s docking has not gone smoothly, the spacecraft developed trouble with its reaction control system thrusters.</p><p><strong>Update: June 6, 12:40 p.m. ET</strong>: NASA has waved off Starliner’s first docking opportunity and is now targeting a backup at 1:33 p.m. ET.</p><p><em>Original article follows.</em></p><p>Starliner is scheduled to autonomously dock to the forward-facing port of the space station’s Harmony module at approximately 12:15 p.m. on June 6, where it will remain for about a week.
