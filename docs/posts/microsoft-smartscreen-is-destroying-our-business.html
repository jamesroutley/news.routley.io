    <h1>Ask HN: Microsoft SmartScreen is destroying our business</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>About a month ago, Microsoft SmartScreen suddenly started flagging the login page of our SaaS dashboard as &#39;unsafe&#39;, scaring away our customers.</p><p>We understand false flags can happen. So we took to the official SmartScreen feedback site to report the false flag (as the website owner). Received an email that stated it would take up to 24hrs to analyse: &#39;If the status of your site has not changed after 24 hours, please contact us with a reply to this message&#39;.</p><p>Sep 8 - first ticket sent.
Sep 9 (24h later) - nothing. So we replied to the message as instructed.
Sep 12 - still nothing. One more reply sent. Asked some of our customers to report our site as safe.
Sep 15 - crickets. Tried calling phone support, impossible to get through; they just hang up on us. Reached out to MS support on Twitter, said they would look into the case.
Sep 22 - no changes - MS twitter support has been unable to find the correct person internally. We replied to the SmartScreen ticket once more. Opened two new tickets. Asked more customers to report the site as safe.
Sep 30 (Today) - now the warning has started to spread from our login page to our entire dashboard. Still no word from Microsoft.</p><p>We are totally baffed that MS allows a false flag to stay up this long, totally ignoring us for almost a full month, meanwhile destroying a business that did nothing wrong...</p><p>We suspect one of our competitors is responsible for falsely reported us. Is &#39;weaponized SmartScreen&#39; a thing?</p><p>Does anyone have a similar experience? Any advince on resolving this matter is greatly appreciated!</p></div></div></div>
