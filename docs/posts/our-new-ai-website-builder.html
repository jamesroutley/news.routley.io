<p>Imagine this: You have an idea—maybe it’s a side hustle, a passion project, or a bold new business. Instead of wrestling with site layouts and design choices, you just say the word…and your website appears.</p>



<p>Creating a website should be simple. And now it’s as simple as having a conversation.</p>



<p>That’s the magic of <a href="https://wordpress.com/ai-website-builder/?ref=blog">our new AI website builder</a>. <strong>It takes your input and instantly creates a fully designed, content-ready WordPress website</strong>, complete with text, layouts, and images, for you. Just you and your vision, with AI handling the rest.</p>







<h2>Who is it for?</h2>



<p>Our AI website builder is ideal for anyone who wants to launch a great-looking website quickly and easily, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Entrepreneurs and small business owners</strong> who need a professional online presence without building it all from scratch.</li>



<li><strong>Freelancers and creators</strong> who want a portfolio that looks great with little effort.</li>



<li><strong>Bloggers and side hustlers</strong> who want to quickly share their ideas online.</li>



<li><strong>Developers</strong> who want to spin up ideas quickly for clients without starting from zero.</li>
</ul>



<p>While it isn’t quite ready to create ecommerce sites or sites that require complex integrations (but stay tuned!), the builder will create beautiful, functional websites in minutes.</p>



<h2>How it works</h2>



<p>Rather than piecing everything together yourself, like picking a theme, adjusting colors, adding text, and finding images, the builder streamlines the process for you:</p>



<ol>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.com/ai-website-builder/?ref=blog">Head to this page</a> and tell us about your website idea.</li>



<li>Log into your existing WordPress.com account or sign up for free.</li>



<li>Watch AI build your site.</li>



<li>Make changes by manually editing the page or by asking for updates in the chat box.</li>



<li>Ready to share your site with others? <a href="https://wordpress.com/pricing/?ref=blog">A WordPress.com hosting plan</a> gives your AI-built site a secure, reliable home online with a free domain for the first year. Then <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/launch-your-website/#launch-your-website">you can go live when the timing is right</a>, or click the <strong>Launch</strong> button in the top-right corner to launch immediately.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Use the AI website builder like a pro</h2>



<p>Unlike other AI experiences that generate basic, one-size-fits-all templates, <em>our</em> AI website builder does things differently. Here are a few key tips to keep in mind when you use it:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Be as specific as possible in your first prompt</strong>: The more information you supply to the builder, the better. Provide your desired site name and a short description of the site (Is it a portfolio site, blog, or business website? What kind of content will you publish on the site?). Remember that you’ll be able to tweak colors, fonts, layouts, and images later, so don’t stress about this step too much!</li>



<li><strong>Create a new site to use the builder</strong>: This feature is currently only available for brand-new WordPress.com websites.</li>



<li><strong>Get 30 free prompts</strong>: Want a new page? What about a contact form? How about a new picture for your homepage? Take advantage of your 30 free prompts (or purchase a hosting plan for your site to get unlimited prompts) to create a site that’s uniquely yours. </li>



<li><strong>Return anytime</strong>: Want to take a break? Once you have a hosting plan, you can return to using the AI website builder by going to <em>Appearance → Editor</em> in your WordPress.com site dashboard whenever inspiration strikes.</li>



<li><strong>It’s still WordPress</strong>: If you want to take over, you can edit and add pages manually, change the site design, and use development tools <a href="https://wordpress.com/hosting/?ref=blog">on our Business plan and above</a>. </li>



<li><strong>Learn more</strong>: Dive deeper into using the builder by <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/ai-website-builder/">checking out our support documentation</a>. </li>
</ol>



<h2>Get started today</h2>



<p>You need a website, not a new skill set. Instead of figuring out how to build a website from scratch, you can have a full-blown WordPress site that looks great and works seamlessly without the manual effort. </p>



<p>Get online fast, and start running your business, sharing your ideas, or having a place to call your own on the web.</p>
