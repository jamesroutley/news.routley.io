    <h1>How IKEA tricks you into buying more stuff</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>On a recent Saturday afternoon, <strong>Alex Santos</strong> journeyed to his local Ikea with a singular mission: the procurement of a new Poäng chair.</p>



<p>It was a simple in-and-out task. But 3 hours later, the 37-year-old IT manager found himself in the parking lot, slightly stupefied, with a shopping cart full of hand towels, throw pillows, and martini glasses.</p>



<p>“It’s like Ikea makes it impossible to leave with only the stuff you came here for,” Santos told <em>The Hustle</em>.</p>



<p>He isn’t wrong.</p>



<p>It’s estimated that <strong>60% of Ikea purchases</strong> <strong>are </strong><a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/bit5414/2012/03/20/the-ikea-layout-and-impulse-buying-a-case-study/"><strong>impulse buys</strong></a>. And Ikea’s own creative director has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYKUJgMRQ7A">said</a> that only <strong>20%</strong> of the store’s purchases are based on actual logic and needs.</p>

<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>All of this unplanned buying has earned Ikea an <a href="https://gbl-sc9u2-prd-cdn.azureedge.net/-/media/interikea/igi/financial-reports/inter-ikea-group-financial-summary-fy21-3.pdf?rev=9e0d8eaf3c054bc4937e33e36d80c3c5&amp;hash=1E3F4A4D474711B7841748BFD015B4F3">enviable position</a> in the struggling retail landscape. As of 2021, it boasts:</p>



<ul><li><strong>~$47.6B</strong> USD in annual retail sales</li><li><strong>458 </strong>stores in <strong>61</strong> markets</li><li><strong>775m</strong> store visits + <strong>5B</strong> web visits per year</li><li><strong>225k</strong> global employees</li></ul>



<p>On the surface, this success may seem a bit perplexing because Ikea’s way of doing business is extremely unorthodox.</p>



<p>It sells meatballs and lamps under the same roof. It has been described as both “Disneyland for adults” and “a nightmare hellscape.” And the idea of spending an afternoon stuck in a one-way maze — then going home and assembling your own bookcase — isn’t exactly appealing.</p>



<p>But these eccentricities are intentionally engineered to get you to make unplanned purchases, and come back for more.</p>

<h4 id="h-let-s-start-with-that-ridiculous-store-layout"><strong>Let’s start with that ridiculous store layout</strong></h4>



<p>In general, retailers design their stores with 3 goals in mind:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Intelligibility:</strong> Easy to understand the floor plan</li><li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Easy to navigate</li><li><strong>A clear visual field:</strong> Exposure to products and the lay of the land </li></ol>



<p>Most companies use store layouts that give customers the <strong>freedom to explore</strong> at their own will.</p>



<p>Commonly used configurations — grid, racetrack, freeform, and spine — don’t have defined routes: You can wander down any aisle you please, in any order you want.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="826" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/comonlayouts.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/comonlayouts-300x207.png 300w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/comonlayouts-1024x705.png 1024w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/comonlayouts-768x529.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/comonlayouts-50x34.png 50w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/comonlayouts.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>Ikea breaks all of these rules.</p>



<p>Inside, customers are led through a preordained, <strong>one-way path</strong> that winds through 50+ room settings. The average Ikea store is<strong> 300k sq. ft.</strong> — the equivalent of about 5 football fields — and their typical shopper ends up walking almost a mile.</p>



<p>Want a lamp? You’re going to have to walk past cookware, rugs, toilet brushes, and shoehorns to get there.</p>



<p>This serves several purposes:</p>



<ol><li><strong>It forces wider product exposure:</strong> At most retail shops, customers only <a href="https://businessbar.net/all/the-ikea-experience-not-just-another-furniture-store/">lay eyes on</a> ~<strong>33%</strong> of all the items for sale; Ikea’s layout herds shoppers past its entire catalog.</li><li><strong>It creates a false sense of scarcity:</strong> When shoppers pass by items they’re on the fence about, they’re <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scarcity-principle.asp#:~:text=In%20a%20free%20market%2C%20it,supply%20will%20likely%20be%20expensive.">inclined</a> to just put them in the cart because they don’t want to backtrack through the maze later on.</li><li><strong>It creates a sense of mystery:</strong> Every 50 feet, the path breaks left. Shoppers never know what’s around the next turn, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0013916587191001">stoking their desire</a> to continue exploring.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Alan Penn</strong>, a professor of architecture at University College London who has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkePRXxH9D4">studied</a> Ikea’s layout, calls it a “psychological weapon” used to drive unintended consumption.</p>



<p>“Going to Ikea is truly a submissive experience,” he told <em>The Hustle</em>. “You relinquish control to its maze. And when you’ve done that, you’re more likely to hand over control of your wallet, too.”</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="1991" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/layout.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/layout-181x300.png 181w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/layout-617x1024.png 617w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/layout-768x1274.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/layout-926x1536.png 926w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/layout-30x50.png 30w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/layout.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>Ikea has mastered the use of a psychological principle called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruen_transfer#:~:text=In%20shopping%20mall%20design%2C%20the,susceptible%20to%20making%20impulse%20buys."><strong>Gruen effect</strong></a> — when the layout of a store is so bewildering that it makes you forget the original reason you came there, leading to impulse buys.</p>



<p><strong>Jeff Hardwick</strong>, who <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mall-Maker-Victor-Architect-American/dp/0812221109">wrote a book</a> on the Gruen effect, told <em>The Hustle</em> that the principle is at play all around you at Ikea.</p>



<p>“You get lost in that maze, and then you are surrounded by nothing but ever-changing fantasies of what your life could be like,” he said. “It’s like you can walk into a magazine advertisement and pick up the dishes, sit on the couch, try out the desk chair. It’s very tactile and participatory.”</p>



<p>Lost in this stupor, you might find it easy to fall victim to some of Ikea’s other tricks:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Strategically placed mirrors: </strong>When you catch a glimpse of yourself in an Ikea room, you’re primed to believe you belong in it.</li><li><strong>Contextual positioning:</strong> Rooms are set up exactly as they would be in a natural setting. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2488834">Familiarity</a> encourages purchasing. </li><li><strong>“Bulla bulla” (dump bins):</strong> Ikea places overstuffed crates of dirt-cheap products (plush toys, slippers, pillows) along the route to reinforce the idea that its products are a good deal.</li></ul>



<p>If you look closely, something else you’ll likely see at play in Ikea is <a href="https://www.lokad.com/decoy-pricing-definition#:~:text=Decoy%20pricing%20is%20a%20pricing,to%20%E2%80%9Cforce%E2%80%9D%20customer%20choice.&amp;text=And%20when%20a%20company%20decides,consumer%20in%20his%20purchasing%20decision."><strong>decoy pricing</strong></a>: when a retailer throws a less appealing option into the mix to make other products seem like a better deal.</p>



<p>Let’s say there are 2 cabinets for sale: a $40 budget unit, and an $80 unit with more premium materials. Ikea might create a 3rd unit — one that offers neither the low price of the budget unit, nor the premium materials of the pricier unit — to make the others look better.</p>



<p>Studies <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2020.1231">have shown</a> that the decoy effect can increase retail sales by as much as 14%.</p>

<p>Strategies like this help explain why we buy more stuff once we’re <em>inside</em> an Ikea.</p>



<p>But what brings us there in the first place — and what ultimately dictates many of our spending decisions — is the allure of affordable prices.</p>



<h4 id="h-ikea-works-hard-to-keep-prices-low"><strong>Ikea works hard to keep prices low</strong></h4>



<p>Ikea often follows a “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ikea-price-first-design-later-2016-10">price first, design later</a>” philosophy: It starts with a price target — say $6.99 for a new stool — then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603032922/https://www.ikea.com/ms/en_JP/about_ikea/the_ikea_way/our_business_idea/our_low_prices.html">reverse-engineers</a> the design process to meet that goal.</p>



<p>And once an Ikea product hits the shelves, the company is militant about maintaining, or even reducing, its retail price.</p>



<p>Researchers at Boston University and the Wharton School <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/BaxterLandry.pdf">studied</a> hundreds of Ikea catalogs in 6 different countries between 1994 and 2010 and found that many of the company’s products <strong>get </strong><strong><em>cheaper</em></strong><strong> over time</strong>. </p>



<p>Take, for instance, Ikea’s uber-popular <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/poaeng-armchair-birch-veneer-hillared-anthracite-s49305924/#content">Poäng chair</a> — a product that sells 1.5m units per year: In 1994, it went for<strong> $179</strong> (~$340, adjusted for inflation). Today, it’s <strong>$129</strong>.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="986" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/poangchair.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/poangchair-300x247.png 300w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/poangchair-1024x841.png 1024w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/poangchair-768x631.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/poangchair-50x41.png 50w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/poangchair.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p><em>The Hustle</em> looked back at newspaper ads from 1985 and found that this holds true with other bestselling Ikea products, too:</p>



<ul><li>The <strong>Billy bookcase</strong> — a product so beloved that one is sold <a href="https://www.inc.com/betsy-mikel/move-over-apple-ikea-is-2017s-most-in-demand-cult-brand.html">every 5 seconds</a> — retailed for <strong>$82</strong> in 1985. Today, it goes for <strong>$50</strong>.</li><li>The<strong> Lack side table</strong> came with a <strong>$25 </strong>price tag in 1985. Now, it can be had for <strong>$13</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>Ikea seems to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-weird-economics-of-ikea/">adhere</a> to a “<strong>survival of the fittest</strong>” pricing model: If a product’s price can’t be reduced over time, it tends to get discontinued. (There are exceptions to this: In 2022, Ikea says it will <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/31/business/ikea-price-increase/index.html">raise its prices</a> by ~9% to offset pandemic-related supply chain woes.)</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="914" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/lackdecrease.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/lackdecrease-300x229.png 300w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/lackdecrease-1024x780.png 1024w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/lackdecrease-768x585.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/lackdecrease-50x38.png 50w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/lackdecrease.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>The main ingredient of the company’s affordability is a technique called <strong>flat packing</strong>.</p>



<p>The company reduces manufacturing, logistics, and fulfillment costs by disassembling items and fitting pieces together in a box as tightly as possible. “We hate air” is a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ikea-cant-stop-obsessing-about-its-packaging-1434533401">common mantra</a> at Ikea: Every pocket of space is accounted for and minimized.</p>



<p>“Ikea designs products with manufacturing and transit in mind from the get-go,” said <strong>Katelan Cunningham</strong>, of the logistics software company <a href="https://www.lumi.com/">Lumi</a>. “They design for the realities of the supply chain, rather than having to make sacrifices for it.”</p>



<p>Obsessive changes in packaging have saved Ikea millions of dollars:</p>



<ul><li>When Ikea transitioned its <strong>Ektorp sofa</strong> to be flat packed, it shrunk its packaging for that product by <strong>50%</strong>, reduced its logistics by <strong>7,477</strong> truckloads, and led to a <strong>14%</strong> price reduction for consumers.</li><li>Repackaging the <strong>Jules</strong> <strong>office chair </strong>by separating the base and the seat saved the company <strong>~$1.4m per year</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>The obvious downside to flat packing is that consumers have to assemble their own furniture — but even offsetting labor works in the company’s favor.</p>



<h4 id="h-the-ikea-effect"><strong>The Ikea effect</strong></h4>



<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/02/why-so-many-couples-fight-at-ikea.html">running joke</a> that assembling Ikea furniture with a loved one is a surefire way to get a divorce.</p>



<p>The reality, though, is that Ikea’s furniture building model likely contributes to, rather than inhibits, overall sales.</p>



<p>In a 2011 <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/11-091.pdf">Harvard Business School study</a>, researchers divided subjects into 2 groups: One was given <em>pre-assembled</em> origami, and the other was given paper to <em>build their own</em> origami. At the end of the experiment, subjects were asked how much they’d pay for the creations.</p>



<p>The result: Those who built their own origami were <strong>willing to pay nearly 5x more </strong>than the non-builders.</p>



<p>The researchers dubbed this the <strong>Ikea effect</strong>: a cognitive bias wherein we place a higher value on items we build ourselves, regardless of the quality of the end result.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="1128" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ikeaeffect.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ikeaeffect-300x282.png 300w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ikeaeffect-1024x963.png 1024w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ikeaeffect-768x722.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ikeaeffect-50x47.png 50w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ikeaeffect-24x24.png 24w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ikeaeffect.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>This phenomenon harkens back to an old tale about cake mix.</p>



<p>In the 1950s, manufacturers noticed that powdered cake mix sales were suffering. All the consumer had to do was add water. But this process was <em>too easy</em>: It removed the effort and emotion from baking. When manufacturers <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20171027-the-magic-cakes-that-come-from-a-packet">took out the egg powder</a> and made consumers add their own fresh eggs to the mix, sales went back up.</p>



<p>Furniture and food are, of course, different beasts. But at Ikea, they enjoy a symbiotic relationship.</p>



<h4 id="h-food-courts-drive-furniture-sales"><strong>Food courts drive furniture sales</strong></h4>



<p>Ikea may be a home furnishings store, but it also reels in <strong>~</strong><a href="https://www.ingka.com/news/plenty-of-food-for-thought-at-ikea/"><strong>$2.4B</strong></a> in food sales per year (~5% of its overall revenue).</p>



<p>To put that into perspective: If you were to look at Ikea’s food operation as a stand-alone entity, it would rank as one of the <strong>50 highest-grossing food chains</strong> in the world, right above <a href="https://www.franchisetimes.com/top-400-2021/47-ihop/article_cd0c68e0-0418-11ec-8015-e35ea0b14e9f.html">IHOP</a>.</p>



<p>A typical Ikea has 2 dining options that can accommodate <strong>600+</strong> diners at a time:</p>



<ol><li><strong>A Swedish food market</strong> on the main floor that serves up meatballs, gravlax salmon, and other Scandinavian entrees.</li><li><strong>A bistro</strong> near the exit that slings hot dogs, cinnamon buns, pizza, and other fast-serve favorites.</li></ol>



<p>Why, you might ask, are there food courts in a furniture store?</p>



<p>When Ikea’s founder, <strong>Ingvar Kamprad</strong>, originally integrated food courts into his stores back in 1958, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BW0LEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT122&amp;lpg=PT122&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cit%E2%80%99s+difficult+to+do+business+with+someone+on+an+empty+stomach%E2%80%9D+ikea&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NcH6kjWQ7j&amp;sig=ACfU3U2fELpPzPcYiv5iVI34IltacolBmQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipts3riIr2AhWiD0QIHQjTASgQ6AF6BAgYEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cit%E2%80%99s%20difficult%20to%20do%20business%20with%20someone%20on%20an%20empty%20stomach%E2%80%9D%20ikea&amp;f=false">his rationale</a> was simple: “It’s difficult to do business with someone on an empty stomach.”</p>



<p>But the more direct answer is that there is a clear link between food sales and furniture sales.</p>



<p>In a 2012 <a href="https://www.sciedu.ca/journal/index.php/bmr/article/viewFile/1998/1048">study</a>, researchers in Italy set out to determine the impact of Ikea’s food courts on furniture buying. A survey of 700 shoppers found that those who ate at the food court <strong>spent an average of more than 2x more</strong> on home furnishings than those who didn’t.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="1128" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/foodcourts2.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/foodcourts2-300x282.png 300w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/foodcourts2-1024x963.png 1024w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/foodcourts2-768x722.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/foodcourts2-50x47.png 50w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/foodcourts2-24x24.png 24w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/foodcourts2.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p><strong>Chris Spear</strong>, a former Ikea restaurant manager who now hosts the podcast <a href="https://www.podpage.com/chefs-without-restaurants/">Chefs Without Restaurants</a>, told <em>The Hustle</em> that the food courts actually aren’t a very profitable venture in their own right.</p>



<p>“I was clearly told that profit margin was not something I should be aiming for in the restaurant,” he said. </p>



<p>The real objective, he claims, is to <strong>reinforce Ikea’s low price profile of the store</strong>.</p>



<p>Spear said that when he worked at Ikea, it had a policy that certain food items, like hot dogs, had to be the <strong>lowest price within a 30-mile radius</strong>. Each quarter, corporate would send him out to assess the competition; if Costco sold a hot dog for $1.50, Ikea would have to sell it for less.</p>



<p>A person might not know if $500 is a good price for a couch, but they surely know that $0.99 is a fantastic deal for breakfast. The idea is that customers will associate Ikea’s low food prices with the store’s other offerings.</p>



<p>“Ikea might be selling some of that food at cost, or even at a loss,” said Spear. “But it’s worth it to lose money on scrambled eggs if it means helping them sell more couches.”</p>



<p>Ikea declined a request for comment. But <strong>Gerd Diewald</strong>, who once ran Ikea’s food operations in the US, echoed a similar sentiment in the past.</p>



<p>“We’ve always called the meatballs ‘the best sofa-seller,’” he <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40400784/ikeas-big-bet-on-meatballs">told</a> <em>Fast Company</em> in 2017. “When you feed [customers], they stay longer, they can talk about their purchases, and they make a decision without leaving the store.”</p>

<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>Santos — the guy who went to pick up a $129 Poäng chair and left with a full cart of goods — has a slightly different take on the food courts.</p>



<p>After falling prey to Ikea’s labyrinth of affordable housewares and spending $297.20 more than he intended to, he stopped at the restaurant to cleanse his guilt.</p>
