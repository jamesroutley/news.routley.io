<p>Wildlife is adversely affected by water pollution in a number of ways:</p>
<p><strong><u>Direct poisoning</u></strong></p>
<p>Wildlife can be directly poisoned through toxic levels of certain chemicals. These become more acute if water levels and/or oxygen levels are low.</p>
<p>In the 80s, DDT in the food-chain caused a huge decline in peregrine falcon numbers as it weakened their egg-shells so that in effect they became infertile. DDT usage was banned in the UK in 1986 - but a similar scenario could play out in the food chain of rivers if water pollution isn’t addressed. </p>
<p><strong><u>Eutrophication</u></strong></p>
<p>A high level of nitrates and phosphates can cause eutrophication - where there is a rapid increase in plant growth, particularly algae. Algae uses up oxygen, turns the water green and blocks out light. This in turn suffocates aquatic life. </p>
<p><strong><u>Suffocation</u></strong></p>
<p>Absorbable dissolved oxygen in water is essential for wildlife to survive. When raw sewage enters a river system it is broken down by bacteria, creating ammonia (thereby increasing alkalinity), which uses up a great deal of oxygen. </p>
