They are very concerning,&#34; Detroit Police Chief James E. White wrote in a comment to Insider. &#34;We are taking this matter very seriously.&#34;</p><p>In May — months after Woodruff&#39;s arrest last February — a research paper from criminal justice experts Thaddeus L. Johnson and Nastasha N. Johnson <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740624X22000892?via%3Dihub" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">demonstrated</a> that facial recognition leads police departments to arrest Black people at disproportionately high rates.</p><p>&#34;We believe this results from factors that include the lack of Black faces in the algorithms&#39; training data sets, a belief that these programs are infallible and a tendency of officers&#39; own biases to magnify these issues,&#34; the researchers <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/police-facial-recognition-technology-cant-tell-black-people-apart/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">wrote in an op-ed for Scientific American.</a></p><p>The research also demonstrated that Black people are overrepresented in databases of mugshots, and that skews AI.</p><p>&#34;Consequently AI is more likely to mark Black faces as criminal, leading to the targeting and arresting of innocent Black people,&#34; they wrote.</p><p>Several police departments across the country use facial recognition technology to identify suspects in certain investigations.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/face-recognition-software-led-to-his-arrest-it-was-dead-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Wired reported</a> that Deborah Levi, a Maryland public defender, said the Baltimore Police Department ran nearly 800 facial recognition searches in 2022.
