        <section>
            <p>Since announcing our <a href="https://blog.bambulab.com/firmware-update-introducing-new-authorization-control-system-2/"><u>security enhancement for X-series printers</u></a>, we’ve seen a mix of valuable feedback and unfortunate misinformation circulating online. We value the constructive input from our community, especially from print farm owners whose businesses rely on our technology. This feedback has been important in shaping our approach to ensure a balance between robust security and operational flexibility.</p><p>At the same time, we must address false accusations head-on. Recently, we have come across numerous social media posts spreading baseless allegations and untrue claims about Bambu Lab. We want to make it absolutely clear that all of <strong>these claims are entirely false</strong>:</p><ul><li>Bambu Lab will remotely disable your printer (&#34;brick&#34; it).</li><li>Firmware updates will block your printer’s ability to print.</li><li>AMS functionality will be restricted, and the use of third-party filament will be disabled.</li><li>Bambu Lab firmware contains trojans or backdoors for unauthorized remote control.</li><li>The printers have a timed killswitch that disables them after a certain period.</li><li>All 3D files printed are monitored, duplicated, or stolen.</li><li>A subscription will be mandatory to use your printer.</li></ul><p>This article will clarify our stance, outline the facts, and explain how third-party integration will continue seamlessly through Bambu Connect. Let’s set the record straight and provide the transparency our community deserves.</p><p>We’ve received a wide range of feedback following our announcement, and we’re grateful for the insights shared. Many concerns have come from print farm owners who depend on reliable and uninterrupted access to their 3D printers. We understand the stakes for these businesses, and your feedback has driven meaningful changes in our approach. </p><p>In response, we’ve made the decision to implement an <strong>optional LAN mode feature</strong>, to provide advanced users with more control and flexibility. Under the updated LAN mode:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard Mode (Default):</strong> By default, LAN mode will include an authorization process that ensures robust security. This option is ideal for the majority of users who prioritize security and ease of use. Despite claims to the contrary, LAN mode through Bambu Connect will require neither internet access nor a user account. This hasn&#39;t changed and won&#39;t change.</li><li><strong>Developer Mode (Optional):</strong> For advanced users of the X1, P1, A1, and A1 Mini who prefer full control over their network security, an option will be available to leave the MQTT channel, live stream, and FTP open. This feature must be manually enabled on the printer, and users who select this option will assume full responsibility for securing their local network environment. Please note that Bambu Lab will not be able to provide customer support for this mode, as the communication protocols are not officially supported.</li></ul><h2 id="the-truth-about-our-security-update">The Truth About Our Security Update</h2><p>We’ve been reflecting on the misinformation circulating about our security update, and while it’s disheartening to see these misunderstandings arise, we acknowledge that our communication might have contributed to the confusion. </p><p>Videos, posts, and comments have claimed that we are restricting third-party tools or forcing users into a closed ecosystem. Let&#39;s be clear about what this update actually means and stop the spread of misinformation:</p><ol><li><strong>This is NOT about limiting third-party software.</strong> We&#39;re creating Bambu Connect specifically to ensure continued third-party integration while enhancing security. We&#39;re actively working with developers like Orca Slicer to implement this integration.</li><li><strong>This is beta testing, not a forced update.</strong> The choice is yours. You can participate in the beta program to help us refine these features, or continue using your current firmware.</li><li><strong>About Panda Touch</strong>. We reached out to BTT as soon as we became aware of their product. We warned them that using exploited MQTT protocols was unsustainable and would place customers in an awkward situation once we updated the system. All of this communication occurred before the mass shipment of Panda Touch; however, they chose to ignore our warnings. Unfortunately, the truth is now being presented in a misleading manner. The same concerns apply to other products they manufacture that rely on these MQTT protocols.</li><li><strong>Camera feeds concerns.</strong> Our Live View service uses P2P (Peer-to-Peer) connection, which means video streams directly between your device and printer. Only when a direct P2P connection isn&#39;t possible does it use server forwarding, and even then, no video is ever stored on any server.</li></ol><h2 id="third-party-software-integration-with-bambu-connect">Third-Party Software Integration with Bambu Connect</h2><p><a href="https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-connect?ref=blog.bambulab.com"><u>Bambu Connect</u></a>, currently in development, is designed to be a streamlined interface that maintains the convenience users expect while adding necessary security protocols. We&#39;re actively working with third-party developers to ensure the workflow minimizes disruption to existing user processes.</p><p>When using third-party slicing software like Orca Slicer, the difference in users experience is not much. As you can see in the following video, the whole workflow is almost the same from the users&#39; perspective. The previous device tab in the slicer is replaced by a new application window.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://blog.bambulab.com/content/media/2025/01/Feishu20250118-142551-1_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        </figure><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This demonstration shows our approach to the implementation of Orca Slicer integration. The functionality </em><a href="https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8103?ref=blog.bambulab.com"><em><u>has been implemented</u></em></a><em>, and is now awaiting integration into Orca Slicer.</em></p><p>The integration is seamless, activating only when needed to handle printer communications. Users retain full visibility of their print progress, including real-time monitoring of temperatures, print status, and other critical parameters. This approach maintains the flexibility of third-party software while ensuring all printer commands pass through secure, verified channels.</p><h2 id="how-bambu-connect-works">How Bambu Connect Works</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.bambulab.com/content/images/2025/01/image3-2-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1906" height="1154" srcset="https://blog.bambulab.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/image3-2-1.png 600w, https://blog.bambulab.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/image3-2-1.png 1000w, https://blog.bambulab.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/image3-2-1.png 1600w, https://blog.bambulab.com/content/images/2025/01/image3-2-1.png 1906w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>How Orca Slicer will work with Bambu Connect and Network Plugin</span></figcaption></figure><p>The diagram above illustrates how different components of the system interact under the new security framework. Third-party software like Orca Slicer can continue accessing printer functionality through Bambu Connect and a new network plugin, which provides a secure interface for printer control and monitoring.</p><h2 id="print-farm-management-software">Print Farm Management Software</h2><p>We were fully aware that print farm management software could be affected by this update if not handled properly. That’s why we’ve developed a dedicated tool specifically designed for farm management software. </p><p>Before this launch, we contacted several farm management software vendors, and integration is already in progress.</p><p>Farm management software developers interested in integration can work directly with Bambu Lab to implement proper authorization controls. We welcome partnerships with companies developing legitimate accessories and software for Bambu Lab printers, as demonstrated by our successful collaborations with <a href="https://all3dp.com/4/e3d-diamondback-collab-sees-diamond-tipped-hot-end-for-bambu-lab-printers/?ref=blog.bambulab.com"><u>E3D</u></a> and <a href="https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/bambu-labs-x1-and-p1-3d-printer-series-to-benefit-from-the-new-mako-hotend-233178/?ref=blog.bambulab.com"><u>Slice Engineering</u></a>. To provide flexibility, users have three options:</p><ol><li>Continue using the current firmware.</li><li>Update to the new firmware and integrate with the new tools provided by Bambu Lab.</li><li>Update to the new firmware and switch to Developer Mode for custom solutions.</li></ol><p>For partnership inquiries, developers can contact <a href="mailto:devpartner@bambulab.com"><u>devpartner@bambulab.com</u></a>.</p>
