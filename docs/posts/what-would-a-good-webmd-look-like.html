    <h1>What would a “good” WebMD look like?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>WebMD—and </span><a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/" rel="">its</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.healthline.com/" rel="">imitators</a><span>—are terrible. Often the first stop for health questions, WebMD bombards you with vague, unhelpful articles strewn with garish pharmaceutical ads—an ocean of &#34;content&#34; without substance.</span></p><p><span>And I&#39;m not just some crank with an ax to grind—satisfaction with online health information is incredibly low, </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0033354919874074" rel="">around 38%</a><span>. What&#39;s more, this satisfaction has been very stable over time—</span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0033354919874074" rel="">one study</a><span> found that users in 2008 were just as unhappy with health information as they were in 2017!</span></p><p><span>This is pretty odd. In those nine years two things happened: (1) software got vastly more powerful and (2) researchers published </span><a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/medline_cit_counts_yr_pub.html" rel="">eight million new health citations</a><span>—a 47% increase in </span><em>all published health knowledge</em><span>. So why hasn&#39;t any of this innovation made online health information even </span><em>slightly</em><span> better?</span></p><p>It&#39;s baffling. The sum of human health knowledge is large and growing rapidly—but the meager, watered-down portion allotted to consumers hasn&#39;t grown with it.</p><p>This has always been a problem, but COVID has brought this knowledge gap into sharp relief: consumers have been flocking to health websites in droves, searching in vain for answers to their COVID-related questions. And—thanks to the blistering pace of COVID-related research—those answers are changing frequently, making it almost impossible for a typical person to find up-to-date COVID recommendations.</p><p>In other words, online health information has always been bad, but COVID made the situation dire. So why is no one talking about it?</p><p><span>I think we&#39;ve collectively gotten so used to terrible health information that we can&#39;t even imagine a better version of WebMD. So let&#39;s toss around some ideas—what would </span><em>good</em><span> health information look like?</span></p><p><span>For starters, we&#39;d change the format. Most online health content is buried in long, wordy articles that manage to say almost nothing in 2,000 words (and 8-10 pharmaceutical ads). This isn&#39;t by accident—the goal of these articles isn&#39;t to improve your health, it&#39;s to rank higher on Google! And every SEO expert knows that </span><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/ideal-blog-post-length-for-seo/255633/" rel="">long articles rank higher than short ones</a><span>, so now &#34;treating covid headache&#34; takes you to a </span><a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/coronavirus/how-to-cope-with-a-covid-19-headache/" rel="">thousand-word article</a><span> when really I just want short summaries of the top three treatments.</span></p><p>We don&#39;t tolerate this &#34;editorial style&#34; of information on other websites. Imagine if each Zillow listing was a college-length essay, and instead of saying &#34;1,700 square feet, 3bd/2ba, currently listed for $800k&#34; it said &#34;this house is medium-sized, although some visitors report feeling that this house is smaller or larger than that. It probably has some number of bedrooms, and is listed for a certain number of US dollars.&#34; We&#39;d never use Zillow again! And yet for some reason we accept this as the norm with health information.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d3768e-57e0-4930-9c29-19c91a18fff2_1600x469.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d3768e-57e0-4930-9c29-19c91a18fff2_1600x469.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d3768e-57e0-4930-9c29-19c91a18fff2_1600x469.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d3768e-57e0-4930-9c29-19c91a18fff2_1600x469.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d3768e-57e0-4930-9c29-19c91a18fff2_1600x469.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d3768e-57e0-4930-9c29-19c91a18fff2_1600x469.png" width="1456" height="427" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b2d3768e-57e0-4930-9c29-19c91a18fff2_1600x469.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:427,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d3768e-57e0-4930-9c29-19c91a18fff2_1600x469.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d3768e-57e0-4930-9c29-19c91a18fff2_1600x469.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d3768e-57e0-4930-9c29-19c91a18fff2_1600x469.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d3768e-57e0-4930-9c29-19c91a18fff2_1600x469.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>WebMD is nothing but text and ads, but Zillow gives you all the information you need at a glance.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Instead, it&#39;d be great to have a bit more structure in our health data. What if I want a list of antidepressants, ranked by efficacy? What if I want to filter out the ones with </span><em>nausea</em><span> as a side effect? Or maybe I just want to see the ones with the best evidence. And why—dear god </span><em>why</em><span>—can&#39;t I see the percent of people who experience a particular side effect? I&#39;m obviously not going to take Lexapro if there&#39;s a 90% chance I&#39;ll experience </span><a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-63990/lexapro-oral/details" rel="">&#34;brief feelings similar to electric shock&#34;</a><span>—but if it&#39;s a 0.01% chance then I&#39;d consider it. I </span><em>know </em><span>that data exists—WebMD just doesn&#39;t want to give it to me.</span></p><p><span>So better health information would be quantitative, sortable, filterable, etc.—in short, it would have all of the features we&#39;d expect from Zillow, Amazon, Expedia, Airbnb, Uber, etc.—all of whom are </span><em>very good</em><span> at conveying lots of complicated information to consumers through a 3x5&#39;&#39; screen that they glance at for three seconds.</span></p><p><span>Next, we&#39;d make sure this data was updated frequently, ideally every day. New research often changes the established medical orthodoxy (that&#39;s the point of new research!) but the current editorial-based health references usually update their articles once every few months, and big overhauls happen more like </span><em>annually</em><span>, if ever. Even well-studied diseases (e.g. diabetes) have new research every few weeks—so a health reference that&#39;s a year old can easily have outdated information.</span></p><p><span>Finally, we&#39;d put the evidence front and center. Most consumer health websites either (1) bury their evidence in the footnotes or (2) dispense with evidence altogether. You might be saying, &#34;well, I wasn&#39;t going to read the evidence anyway, I&#39;m sure WebMD has someone vet their articles.&#34; But I promise: the evidence </span><em>does</em><span> matter, even for the &#34;non-science&#34; folks.</span></p><p><span>For example: the WebMD articles on </span><a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-essential-oils#1" rel="">essential oils</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1082-3/aspirin-oral/aspirin-oral/details" rel="">aspirin</a><span> are written in almost the same tone—even though the evidence for aspirin is an order of magnitude stronger than the evidence for essential oils. But because both pages lack a good summary of the evidence, a typical user might think that both treatments are equally likely to be effective. Gah!</span></p><p>Instead, a good health reference would give you a rough idea of the confidence that researchers have about the topic. It might list all the studies for a claim, along with structured info about the study: size, design, affiliation, etc.—as well as a clear summary of what this evidence means.</p><p><span>So to summarize: a </span><em>good</em><span> version of WebMD would have</span></p><ul><li><p>structured, quantitative information</p></li><li><p>real-time updates</p></li><li><p>summaries of supporting evidence</p></li></ul><p>So why hasn&#39;t anyone done this yet?</p><p><span>The short answer: </span><strong>cost</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>As I&#39;ve already mentioned, there&#39;s a </span><em>lot</em><span> of medical research out there, with more and more piling up every day. And it costs a lot of money to hire a subject-matter expert to comb through mountains of data and write a 2,000-word treatise on zinc supplements. Imagine how much </span><em>more</em><span> it would cost to pay this person to organize this data in a structured way, make daily updates, and provide exhaustive evidence to back up their claims.</span></p><p><span>And these days, ad-based publishers are seeing their margins decline—most of the big online publishers are </span><a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/resources" rel="">moving toward paid models</a><span> instead. Ad-based publishers like WebMD certainly don&#39;t have piles of cash sitting around waiting to be dumped into quality research and product development.</span></p><p>But—but!—there are two trends that might just solve this problem:</p><ol><li><p>Automated evidence synthesis is improving rapidly</p></li><li><p>More consumers are paying for premium content (Substack, podcasts, online news, etc.)</p></li></ol><p>Each of these trends approaches the cost problem from a different direction—(1) means publishers can now provide higher-quality health info at lower cost, and (2) means publishers can make more money from that same health info, which they can plow back into improving the information. Let&#39;s look at each of these trends in turn.</p><p><span>Automated evidence synthesis is a fancy way of saying &#34;turning health studies into useful information, automatically.&#34; And it&#39;s 2022 so obviously &#34;automatically&#34; is a euphemism for &#34;using a computer.&#34; We&#39;re a pretty long way from </span><em>total</em><span> automation, but several parts of the synthesis pipeline </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8361807.1/" rel="">have gotten much easier recently</a><span>, thanks to ✨technology✨.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F187bd0c8-c10f-439c-becd-f1f647963db5_696x200.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F187bd0c8-c10f-439c-becd-f1f647963db5_696x200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F187bd0c8-c10f-439c-becd-f1f647963db5_696x200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F187bd0c8-c10f-439c-becd-f1f647963db5_696x200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F187bd0c8-c10f-439c-becd-f1f647963db5_696x200.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F187bd0c8-c10f-439c-becd-f1f647963db5_696x200.png" width="696" height="200" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/187bd0c8-c10f-439c-becd-f1f647963db5_696x200.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:200,&#34;width&#34;:696,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F187bd0c8-c10f-439c-becd-f1f647963db5_696x200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F187bd0c8-c10f-439c-becd-f1f647963db5_696x200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F187bd0c8-c10f-439c-becd-f1f647963db5_696x200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F187bd0c8-c10f-439c-becd-f1f647963db5_696x200.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>The many steps required to turn primary research into useful information.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>And the other trend—a move away from ad-based models toward subscription-based models—also seems like a boon for online health information. Not only does this mean that publishers can spend more money on their data—it also aligns the incentives</span><em> </em><span>between the publisher and the user.
