    <h1>Windows 2 for the Apricot PC/Xi</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>(and Word, and Excel, and so much more) by Nina Kalinina, December 27th, 2025 (rev. 1.02 2025-12-27)</p>
<p>I bought my first Apricot PC about three years ago, when I realised I wanted an 8086-based computer. At the time, I knew nothing about it and simply bought it because it looked rad and the price was low. I had no idea that it was not IBM PC-compatible, and that there were very few programs available for it.</p>
<p>I have been on a quest to get a modern-ish word processor and spreadsheet program for it ever since. Which eventually made me &#34;port&#34; Windows 2 on it. In this post, I will tell you the story of this port.</p>
<p>As a side-quest, I also wrote an <a href="https://ninakalinina.com/notes/win2/">article explaining why Windows 2 is kind of awesome</a>. Make sure to check it out, too, if you need more Windows 2 screenshots in your life.</p>
