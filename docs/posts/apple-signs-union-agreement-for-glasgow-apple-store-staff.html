    </p>          <p>The Apple Glasgow store was the first in the UK to unionize, but it has now entered a formal agreement with Apple to have that status recognized.
</p><p>Following <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/06/10/glasgow-apple-store-staff-join-union-ask-apple-to-recognize-it">months of negotiations</a>, Apple Glasgow became unionized in <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/11/02/glasgow-apple-store-staff-become-first-in-uk-to-unionize">November, 2022</a>. Initially workers had to individually join a union, the UK&#39;s GMB, then ask Apple to have union representation recognized.
</p><p><a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/business_hq/23094915.scottish-apple-store-staff-become-first-uk-unionise/">Apple agreed</a> to a voluntary recognition ballot. According to <em>The Herald</em> newspaper, the vote has <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/business_hq/23306382.glasgow-apple-store-staff-first-uk-unionise/">now resulted</a> in Apple signing a collective bargaining agreement to recognize GMB Scotland.
</p><p>&#34;This agreement is historic and our members in the Glasgow store are a beacon of hope across the world to show that you can organise to make work better,&#34; GMB organizer John Slaven told the publication. &#34;We look to build a good relationship with Apple while being passionate advocates for members&#39; interests.&#34; 
</p><p>Apple has not commented on its agreement, but a spokesperson previously told <em>The Herald</em> that the company has  &#34;long been committed to providing an excellent experience for our customers and teams.&#34;
</p><p>&#34;Apple is one of the highest paying retailers in Scotland,&#34; continued the spokesperson, &#34;and we&#39;ve regularly made enhancements to our industry-leading benefits as a part of the overall support we provide to our valued team members.&#34;
</p><p><h2 data-anchor="many-apple-stores-want-to-join-unions" id="many-apple-stores-want-to-join-unions">Many Apple Stores want to join unions</h2>
</p><p>GMB Scotland is part of the UK-wide union now known as just &#34;the GMB.&#34; It&#39;s a <a href="http://www.gmb.org.uk/">trade union</a> that was previously named the General, Municipal, Boilermakers&#39; and Allied Trade Union, and was formed from the merger of many workers&#39; unions.
</p><p>The official recognition of GMB Scotland for the central Glasgow store comes as many Apple Store staff are working toward the same goal in places such as <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/12/15/london-apple-store-at-white-city-unionizing-with-utaw">London</a>, and <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/09/02/oklahoma-citys-apple-penn-square-retail-workers-want-to-unionize">across the US</a>. 
</p><p>Apple has strenuously fought against the introduction of unions in its retail stores, to the extent that America&#39;s National Labor Relations Board has <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/12/06/apple-engaged-in-illegal-anti-union-tactics-finds-labor-board">found it guilty</a> of illegal anti-union tactics. 
</p><p>Employees in Apple Stores say that they want to unionize because issues over pay and working conditions are being ignored. One member of staff described <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/11/14/complaining-about-apple-retail-conditions-is-like-writing-to-santa">telling Apple</a> about problems as being &#34;like writing a letter to Santa.&#34;</p>
