    <h1>WordPress retaliation impacts community</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>It is too early to say what the outcome will be in the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/991906/">ongoing fight</a> between <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> and <a href="https://wpengine.com/">WP Engine</a>, but the <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> community at large is already the
loser. Automattic founder and CEO Matt Mullenweg has been using
his control of the project, and the WordPress.org infrastructure, to
punish WP Engine and remove some dissenting contributors from discussion
channels. Most recently, Mullenweg has instituted a hostile fork of a
WP Engine plugin and the forked plugin is replacing the original
via WordPress updates.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the Automattic and WP Engine spat, many
people hoped that the companies would ratchet down the
hostilities—or at least leave it to lawyers to sort out while
leaving the larger community out of it. Those hopes have gone unrealized.</p>

<p>WP Engine did try to opt for the legal-only route. The day
after the &#34;<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine-reprieve/">reprieve</a>&#34;
on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine-banned/">WordPress.org
ban</a> ended, October 2, WP Engine filed a <a href="https://wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Complaint-WP-Engine-v-Automattic-et-al.pdf">62‑page
complaint</a> against Automattic and Mullenweg personally, and asked
for a jury trial. The suit&#39;s claims include contractual
interference, computer fraud (for blocking its access to WordPress.org),
attempted extortion, libel, and slander. In addition, the suit asks for
declaratory judgment that WP Engine is not infringing on or
diluting the WordPress, WooCommerce, and other trademarks that
Automattic named in its <a href="https://automattic.com/2024/wp-engine-cease-and-desist.pdf">cease‑and‑desist letter</a>.</p>

<p>That is, of course, a move that was unlikely to rebuild any burned
bridges between Automattic and WP Engine. It was predictable that
the WordPress.org ban would remain in place, that
Automattic would respond to the suit, and perhaps countersue
WP Engine. However, to date, there has been no indication of a
countersuit or response to WP Engine&#39;s lawsuit. Instead,
Mullenweg is using other means to cause problems for
WP Engine—and those tactics have spilled over to the wider
WordPress community in troubling ways.</p>

<h4>The checkbox</h4>

<p>Participating in the development of WordPress is not realistically
possible without logging into the site. Using WordPress.org is
mandatory for those who would like to <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/">contribute and update
plugins</a>, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/">access the
WordPress Trac (bug tracker) instance</a>, and more. On October 9, <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-login-gets-mandatory-affiliation-checkbox-following-wp-engine-dispute">a
new checkbox was added</a> to the account login form on WordPress.org
which reads &#34;<q>I am not affiliated with WP Engine in any way,
financially or otherwise.</q>&#34; If the box is left unchecked, users
will get a prompt to check the box if they wish to proceed.</p>

<p>Naturally, many contributors had questions about this new
checkbox, since its wording is ambiguous and any possible consequences
are murky. It seems clear it would apply to those employed by
WP Engine, but just how far does &#34;<q>financially and
otherwise</q>&#34; go? Does this apply, for example, to employees of the
many companies that host their clients&#39; web sites on WP Engine?
Customers with a subscription to one of WP Engine&#39;s services? A
number of contributors have sought answers about this
policy in the WordPress Slack, with disappointing results. A handful
have reported being banned from the Slack instance after these conversations, either due to
pressing for answers or questioning Mullenweg&#39;s leadership.</p>

<p>Javier Casares <a href="https://twitter.com/JavierCasares/status/1843963052183433331">shared</a> that his account was deactivated after he asked a series
of questions in <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1728463928352389">a Slack
thread</a> started by Colin Stewart. (Note that one needs to have a
WordPress.org account, and be signed in, to request an account on the
WordPress Slack.) In the thread, Mullenweg said that the value of the
checkbox is not stored, but refused to clarify what qualifies as an
affiliation with WP Engine. He advised those who had questions to
&#34;<q>consult a lawyer</q>&#34;.</p>

<blockquote>

</p></blockquote>


<p>Casares said that most people agree that WP Engine should
contribute more to WordPress, but that using WordPress.org as part of
the battle is counterproductive. He asked on Slack that the language be
changed to indicate a user does not <em>work</em> for WP Engine,
but that suggestion was not taken up.</p>

<h4>Pick a side</h4>

<p>Another participant, Terence Eden, <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1728557220371169?thread_ts=1728463928.352389&amp;cid=C02QB8GMM">asked
on Slack</a>
whether he could send pull requests via GitHub if he was affiliated
with WP Engine. After an exchange with Mullenweg that was less
than helpful, Eden replied:</p>

<blockquote>
I&#39;ve never seen anyone spread so much FUD about their own project
before. I started out as sympathetic to your cause against WP
Engine. But your behaviour has driven me - and many other good people
- away.
</blockquote>

<p>He later <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Edent/113287622359524228">reported on
Mastodon</a> that his account was deactivated.
Andrew Hutchings, a contributor who works on WordPress as part of
his work with the <a href="https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB
Foundation</a>, participated in the conversation
as well. He <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1728468126620539?thread_ts=1728463928.352389&amp;cid=C02QB8GMM">wondered
on Slack</a>
how many individual contributors could afford a lawyer to advise about
the checkbox and added &#34;<q>I work for a different Foundation, one that
definitely cannot afford a lawyer for me to contribute.</q>&#34; He <a href="https://linuxjedi.co.uk/my-wordpress-slack-ban/">wrote</a> on
his blog about being banned and said that he just wanted to work on
the project:</p>

<blockquote>
I think I speak for many in the WordPress community / ecosystem when I
say that we don&#39;t want to take sides in this battle. We don&#39;t want to
be forced to take sides via a checkbox. We just want to get work done,
to improve WordPress for everyone.
</blockquote>

<p>That may not be an option. During the
checkbox discussion in the #meta Slack channel Alex Sirota <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1728466624103039?thread_ts=1728463928.352389&amp;cid=C02QB8GMM">said</a>:
&#34;<q>Do you not understand what is happening here? It&#39;s pretty simple
in my opinion: you have to take a side.</q>&#34; Stewart <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1728466840305579?thread_ts=1728463928.352389&amp;cid=C02QB8GMM">said</a> that if that
was the intention, then Mullenweg could say so himself. Shortly after,
Mullenweg <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1728466945131879?thread_ts=1728463928.352389&amp;cid=C02QB8GMM">said</a>,
&#34;<q>I want you all to be informed and involved. Not to stay on the
sidelines.</q>&#34; Sirota&#39;s account has also been deactivated now, though it is not clear
whether he was banned or deactivated the account himself.</p>

<p>Mullenweg had also asked Automattic employees to pick a side, shortly
after banning WP Engine from WordPress.org. He <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/alignment/">wrote</a> on October 3
that Automattic had extended an &#34;<q>Alignment Offer</q>&#34; to its
employees. The company provided a buyout package of $30,000 or six
months of salary (whichever was higher) to employees who wanted to
leave because they disagreed with Mullenweg&#39;s actions. Employees who
accepted the buyout were immediately terminated and are not eligible
for rehire. According to the post, 159 people⁠—⁠8.4% of the
company⁠—⁠accepted the offer.</p>

<h4>Advanced Custom Fields</h4>

<p>WordPress&#39;s popularity has a lot to do with its plugins and themes.
A vanilla WordPress installation is missing a lot of
features that one might want or need to run a web site: backups,
commerce features, statistics, contact forms, search-engine
optimization (SEO), managing URL redirects, or adding additional
content types to WordPress.</p> 

<p>A large ecosystem has sprung up around WordPress to offer services
via those plugins, paid versions of plugins with additional
functionality, and paid themes to simplify site design. In turn, that
helps solidify WordPress&#39;s place as the most popular content-management
system (CMS) on the web.</p> 

<p>WP Engine produces popular plugin called <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/">Advanced Custom
Fields</a> (ACF), which has more than two million installs through
WordPress.org. It allows developers to add <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/getting-started-with-acf/#creating-fields">extra content
fields</a> (called custom fields) to WordPress&#39;s edit screens. This
might be used, for example, as part of adding a <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/date-picker/">date
picker</a> or an <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/gallery/">interface
to create photo galleries</a> for a site. ACF is, in turn, used by or
in conjunction with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/Advanced+Custom+Fields/">a
large number</a> of other WordPress plugins such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-forms/">Advanced Forms
for ACF</a> and <a href="https://wpml.org/documentation/related-projects/translate-sites-built-with-acf/">WPML</a>
for translating WordPress sites.</p> 

<p>The base ACF plugin is free, but it also has a <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/#pricing-table">paid
version</a> (&#34;ACF Pro&#34;) with a yearly subscription. Both are available
under the GPLv2, but users must pay for access to updates on the Pro
version and those come directly from WP Engine.</p>

<p>On September 28, Mullenweg <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1727501240087269">asked
on Slack</a> whether ACF Pro should be included in <a href="https://solidwp.com/blog/wordpress-core/">WordPress core</a>,
the components and functionality included in a default install of
WordPress. That drew mixed responses in the channel. Some users noted
that the ability to add custom fields was long overdue, but others had <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1727505491855069?thread_ts=1727501240.087269&amp;cid=C02RQBWTW">qualms</a>
about taking over ACF Pro &#34;<q>out of spite</q>&#34;. Richard Korthuis <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1727505533162479?thread_ts=1727501240.087269&amp;cid=C02RQBWTW">asked</a>
what kind of message it would send to other developers who create paid
plugins: &#34;<q>No matter what you think about WP Engine and the whole
dispute, this [sends] developers the wrong message and would prevent
future investments in new plugins</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/iN3MQkN.png">now-deleted
Tweet</a>, Automattic announced on October 5, a Saturday, that it had &#34;<q>responsibly disclosed
a vulnerability</q>&#34; in ACF to WP Engine. The company did not provide
further details. John Blackbourn, the WordPress core security team
lead, <a href="https://twitter.com/johnbillion/status/1842627564453454049">said</a>
that Automattic had breached the <a href="https://kb.intigriti.com/en/articles/6054585-intigriti-code-of-conduct">Intigriti
Code of Conduct</a> by &#34;<q>irresponsibly announcing</q>&#34; the
vulnerability publicly. Intigriti is a company that runs bug-bounty programs
for companies, <a href="https://app.intigriti.com/programs/wpengine/wpengine/detail">including
WP Engine</a>.</p>

<p>On October 7, WP Engine <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/acf-6-3-8-security-release/">announced</a> a
security release of the plugin. The vulnerability itself seems to be
minor, according to the release notes. It is not a flaw that can be
exploited remotely and it only impacts &#34;<q>the unlikely
scenario</q>&#34; where a user with administrative privileges tries to
attack other administrative users, or tries to gain super-admin
privileges on a multi-site installation of WordPress. So far few other
details on the vulnerability beyond that have been provided. Another <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/967192/">XZ backdoor</a> it is not.</p>

<p>Because its
developers are now blocked from WordPress.org, WP Engine had to <a href="https://x.com/wp_acf/status/1843376378210857441">provide its fix
to the WordPress Security team</a> to have it uploaded to the plugin
directory. There are also <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/installing-and-upgrading-to-the-latest-version-of-acf/">instructions</a>
on updating the plugin manually to receive updates directly from WP Engine.</p>

<h4>ACF fork</h4>

<p>Mullenweg made an <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/secure-custom-fields/">announcement</a>
on October 12, another Saturday, &#34;<q>on behalf of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/security/">WordPress
security team</a></q>&#34; that ACF was being forked as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/">Secure Custom
Fields</a> (SCF) under <a href="https://github.com/wordpress/wporg-plugin-guidelines/blob/trunk/guideline-18.md">point 18</a>
of the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-plugin-guidelines/tree/trunk?tab=readme-ov-file#table-of-contents">plugin
directory guidelines</a>. That part of the guidelines states, in part,
that WordPress.org may &#34;<q>remove developer access to a plugin in lieu
of a new, active, developer</q>&#34; and &#34;<q>make changes to a plugin,
without developer consent, in the interest of public
safety</q>&#34;. According to the post this move was &#34;<q>a rare and
unusual situation brought on by WP Engine&#39;s legal attacks</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>Automattic has not merely forked the ACF code and made it available
under a new name to compete with WP Engine. That might raise a
few eyebrows, but it would probably be considered fair game by most
observers.</p>

<p>Instead, it has forked the code and taken over the plugin&#39;s entry,
including all of its reviews, in the WordPress.org catalog. The new
plugin is being substituted in place of ACF for all of the users who have
installed it previously. According to the announcement on
WordPress.org, sites that auto-update plugins will receive the SCF
plugin automatically. Some site owners may be unaware that the plugin
has been silently replaced. According to a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41833808">comment</a> by
Mullenweg on Hacker News on October 14, there have already
been 225k downloads of the new plugin, and he estimated &#34;<q>at least 60%
of the sites with auto-upgrade on and using .org for updates</q>&#34; have
been moved to the fork.</p>

<p>This is not the first time a company has taken control of a package
distributed through a central repository, though it is rare. The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/681410/">left-pad
incident</a> in 2016, for example, saw <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm,
Inc.</a> restore left-pad to the Node.js package
repository after its developer, Azer Koçulu, removed it. That move, however, was
intended to reduce disruption to the Node.js ecosystem: the removal had
broken builds for thousands of projects that had included the package,
and Koçulu had effectively abandoned it.</p>

<p>The takeover of ACF&#39;s place in the WordPress directory, on the
other hand, is a punitive move by Automattic against another company
that reaches beyond WordPress.org&#39;s infrastructure into millions of
WordPress installs. Web developer Charles Fulton <a href="https://blog.goodbyeplease.com/2024/10/12/The-call-is-coming-from-inside-the-house/">wrote</a>
about the incident and said that this is &#34;<q>a profoundly destabilizing action for the WordPress
plugin ecosystem</q>&#34;; he wondered if he needed to worry about updates
to core WordPress that might interfere with ACF Pro.</p>

<h4>WPGraphQL brought into the fold</h4>

<p>Users of ACF Pro that depend on the <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/">WPGraphQL</a> and <a href="https://acf.wpgraphql.com/">WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom
Fields</a> plugins may have real cause to be concerned that Automattic
will look to break compatibility for ACF. WPGraphQL
provides a <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>
schema and API for WordPress sites and is a popular plugin to
use in conjunction with ACF. Jason Bahl, the maintainer of the  plugin, <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2024/10/07/wpgraphql-becomes-a-canonical-plugin-my-move-to-automattic">announced</a>
on October 7 that he was leaving WP Engine to join
Automattic. Additionally, he said that WPGraphQL is becoming a
&#34;<q>canonical plugin</q>&#34; for WordPress.</p>

<p>The concept of canonical plugins is
loosely defined, but Mullenweg <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/11/canonical-plugins-revisited/">described
them</a> in 2022 as official plugins that are the first choice
for a type of functionality, but too niche to be included in the core
distribution. With WPGraphQL development under Automattic&#39;s roof, it
seems unlikely that compatibility with ACF will be a priority.</p>

<p>Scott Kingsley Clark, who has been involved in a project to bring a
fields API into the WordPress core, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/10/13/fields-api-team-seeking-new-leadership/">announced</a>
on October 13 that he was stepping down from contributing to
WordPress core. The <a href="https://github.com/sc0ttkclark/wordpress-fields-api">fields API
project</a> on GitHub has been archived with a goodbye notice that
states that it pains him to stop but that he is &#34;<q>done making excuses for
Matt&#39;s actions and will not associate myself with core any
longer</q>&#34;. He <a href="https://scottodon.com/@skc/113297201274378086">added</a>
on Mastodon.social that he was going to remain part of the WordPress
community overall, and continue working on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/">Pods</a> plugin.</p>

<h4>What next?</h4>

<p>What happens next, what Mullenweg will <em>do</em> next, is
anyone&#39;s guess. Mullenweg&#39;s vendetta against WP Engine has
spilled over into the community in a way that can&#39;t easily be
ignored or avoided. His leadership of the project is being repeatedly
called into question by contributors, users, and outside
observers. That will spill over, if it hasn&#39;t already, into the wider
commercial ecosystem and have serious consequences for plugin
creators, creative agencies, and hosting providers who have invested a
lot into WordPress.</p>

<p>More contributors are likely to step away, whether they do so
publicly or simply drift away and find other things to do with their
time. Quite a few users on social networks have commented that they
would no longer recommend WordPress and are looking for
alternatives. A fork, in addition to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/992219/">ClassicPress</a>, seems almost
inevitable.</p>

<p>There is a legitimate conversation to be had, or continued, about the
commercialization of open-source projects by companies that do little
to sustain open-source software but reap its benefits and pull revenue
away from the companies that <em>do</em> put in the work. That conversation has
been completely eclipsed by Mullenweg&#39;s actions to punish WP Engine.</p>

<h4>Mullenweg the &#34;mad king&#34;</h4>

<p>Armin Ronacher, creator of the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/">Flask</a> web
framework for Python and participant in launching the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/993073/">Open Source Pledge</a>, has some <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/10/14/mixing-oss-and-money/">interesting
thoughts</a> on the topic of mixing money and open source in light of
the ongoing WordPress crisis:</p>

<blockquote>
Is it a wise [idea] to mix Open Source and money? Maybe not. Yet I also
believe it&#39;s something that is just a reality we need to
navigate. Today there are some projects too small to get any funding
(xz) and there are projects large enough to find some way to sustain
by funneling money to it (Rails, WordPress).
</blockquote>

<p>He observes that he has seen too many
people in open source struggle &#34;<q>one way or another</q>&#34; as a direct
or indirect result of work in open source. He says Mullenweg, like
other creators of open-source projects, feels wronged by seeing others
find financial success from his project even though WordPress is
uncommonly successful &#34;<q>in terms of impact, success, and financial
return for its creator</q>&#34;. Mullenweg&#39;s actions, Ronacher said,
&#34;<q>have alienated many who would otherwise support him. He&#39;s turning into a &#39;mad
king&#39;</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>That is deeply unfortunate, because the questions about sustainability
of open-source projects, and who profits from them versus who produces
them, are in need of addressing. Instead of having <em>that</em>
conversation, Mullenweg has put questions about governance,
centralized software distribution, and software supply chains at the forefront.</p>

<p>After decades of being a poster child for the goodness of open
source, WordPress is becoming a case study in the dangers of the
company-owned project model. Instead of being the safe choice,
WordPress is starting to be seen as the risky one—and that
perception may impact open source as a whole.</p>
