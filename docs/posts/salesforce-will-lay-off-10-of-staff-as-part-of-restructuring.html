       joins a host of other tech companies that have admitted in recent months that they grew too quickly for the current environment. </p> <p>“As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic, we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we’re now facing, and I take responsibility for that,” Co-Chief Executive Marc Benioff said in a letter to employees that was also filed with the SEC.</p> <p>The company had 73,541 employees as of Jan. 31, 2022, according to its last annual filing with the SEC.</p> <p>Salesforce expects that it will take $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion in charges related to the plan, $800 million to $1 billion of which is expected to be incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, which is ongoing. The bulk of the total expected charges relates to employee transition, severance, employee benefits, or stock-based compensation. </p> <p>The company anticipates that it will be done with the staffing elements of the restructuring plan by the end of fiscal 2024 and done with the real-estate efforts during fiscal 2026. </p> <p>Salesforce “clearly is seeing headwinds in the field and thus is trying to quickly adjust to a softening demand environment,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients. </p> <p>Mizuho’s Jordan Klein, a desk-based analyst associated with the sales team and not the research unit, said in a note that the restructuring was a positive step toward helping to “rebuild investor credibility and trust,” and one that showed that Benioff “is not all about growth at any cost.”</p> <p><strong>Read: <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/meta-follows-twitter-in-making-major-job-cuts-11668028132?mod=search_headline&amp;mod=article_inline" rel="follow">Here are the companies in the layoffs spotlight as Adobe and GameStop join Intel, Google, HP, Amazon, Cisco</a></strong></p> <p>Shares of Salesforce were up more than 4% in premarket trading Wednesday.
