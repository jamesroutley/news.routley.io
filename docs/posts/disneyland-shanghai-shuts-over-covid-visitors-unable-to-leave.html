Shanghai Disney said tickets will be valid for six months and refunds will be given.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The snap closure comes just two days after the park began operating at a reduced capacity to comply with Covid measures.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It&#39;s not the first time the park has unexpectedly shut. Last November, 30,000 people were trapped inside after authorities ordered everyone to be tested as part of contact tracing.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Almost three years since China reported its first coronavirus case, authorities across the vast nation continue to impose abrupt and extreme measures in a bid to stop any transmission of the virus.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-63410341">Millions of people</a> are under 200 different lockdowns in China, as of October 24, as the country of 1.45 billion consistently records more than 1,000 new Covid cases a day. The numbers are seen as relatively small outbreaks in other parts of the world. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, earlier this month Chinese President Xi Jinping signalled that there would be no easing up of the zero-Covid policy - which aims to wipe out all outbreaks - calling it a &#34;people&#39;s war to stop the spread of the virus&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Chinese government&#39;s insistence on the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-63410339">increasingly unpopular policy</a> comes as the economy continues to take a hit as a result, with GDP falling by 2.6% in the three months to the end of June from the previous quarter.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>Have you been forbidden to leave Shanghai Disney because of China&#39;s zero-Covid policy?
