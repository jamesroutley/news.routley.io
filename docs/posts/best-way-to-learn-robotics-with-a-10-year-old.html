    <h1>Ask HN: Best way to learn robotics with a 10 year old?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey all, after discovering the greatness of NHRL[1] my son and i would love to try building a small battle bot, but i know nothing of electrical engineering or robotics.</p><p>I prefer to learn how everything works and build something custom instead of just buying a premade kit and following instructions. I was wondering if there are any resources or books that we could go through together that would teach us the basics of electrical engineering and/or robotics.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GzzckUcnfE" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GzzckUcnfE</a></p></div></div></div>
