    <h1>Startup Winter: Hacker News Lost Its Faith</h1>

                <p>In 2013, a failing founder posted their story on Hacker News (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5255209">link</a>). The responses were overwhelmingly supportive: &#34;Failure is just an event, not who you are.&#34; &#34;Get back up and try again!&#34; &#34;This is valuable experience for next time.&#34;</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2025. Another founder shares their journey of six failed attempts (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42771676">link</a>). The sentiment in the comments is strikingly different: &#34;Would have been better to work at BigTech.&#34; &#34;The rat race isn&#39;t worth it.&#34; &#34;Most interesting stories remain buried while we&#39;re presented with a somewhat skewed reality.&#34;</p>
<p>This shift isn&#39;t isolated to these two posts. The same forum that championed &#34;fail fast, fail often&#34; now regularly questions whether the startup path makes sense at all.</p>
<p>What&#39;s changed?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The human cost has become more visible. Stories of burnout, failed relationships, and mental health struggles are no longer swept under the rug of &#34;hustle culture.&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big Tech compensation has transformed the risk-reward equation. When senior engineers can make $300K+ at established companies, the financial argument for startups becomes harder to justify.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VC model&#39;s limitations have become apparent. The focus on hypergrowth and exits has left many founders feeling trapped between authentic business building and investor expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The industry has matured. The low-hanging fruit of the mobile/web era has largely been picked, making truly innovative opportunities harder to find.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe we&#39;re entering what might be called a &#34;Startup Winter&#34; - not because startups have stopped being created, but because the mythology around them has frozen over.</p>
<p>What might emerge from this winter could be a startup ecosystem that&#39;s less glamorous but more authentic. One where alternative paths to innovation are celebrated alongside the traditional VC-backed route.</p>
