The BBC went to see how the game is benefitting inmates at a jail in Worcestershire.</b></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As I walk into HMP Hewell, I watch in silence as five prisoners come under a brutal attack. Two guards are also being assaulted from every direction until they too are forced to retreat.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>I stand watching wave after wave of punishment, and I fear for them all. Then, all of a sudden everything stops. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The room falls quiet and the tall slim man who has inflicted all of the damage, says &#34;check&#34;.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Carl Portman is teaching chess. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Standing thoughtfully within a square made up of black and white boards he slowly spins - playing each of his nine opponents in turn.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Chess is beautiful and brutal, just like life,&#34; says the teacher, who is part of the English Chess Federation.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The reason why people are in prisons is because they didn&#39;t think before they made a move. In chess you have to think before you move.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Some prisoners describe playing the game helps them relax</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Having played for his country, Mr Portman, from Oxfordshire, has spent the last decade teaching the games in prisons where in recent years one of the world&#39;s oldest games has blossomed behind bars.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>HMP Hewell, near Redditch in Worcestershire, is home to more than 1,000 male inmates. Justin is one of them, sitting arms crossed and deep in thought, he stares at the board.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;In most jails, you spend a lot of your time behind your door,&#34; he says. &#34;Chess is good for my mental health, it&#39;s something to concentrate on. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I think of it like a battlefield, but on a board. I&#39;m going to war and it&#39;s nice to have strategy.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The UK&#39;s only charity to organise chess in prisons held its first match within the walls of HMP Isis in London in 2018. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>While their entry was prohibited by lockdown, Chess in Schools and Communities now works with 16 prisons and says applications continue to rise.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Prisoners like Nathan learn &#34;transferrable skills&#34; through chess, says the Ministry of Justice</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The man in charge of HMP Hewell watches on as Mr Portman slides a white bishop across the board, putting a prison officer in check.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Governor Ralph Lubkowski spent 18 months at HMP Stafford where staff ran a chess club with 40 players and says it was something he was keen to replicate at Hewell.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;When the men come into custody, to some extent they&#39;ve lost everything, so how do you start to rebuild that?&#34; he says. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that chess can be a part of it, and we&#39;ve seen so many examples of where the men have flourished and thrived. Officers can play against prisoners, it breaks down barriers,&#34; he adds.  </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Teacher Carl Portman plays opponents while prison governor Ralph Lubkowski and staff look on</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Ministry of Justice says chess trains players to think before they act and provides transferrable skills that can help them find a job so they don&#39;t commit further crimes when released.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A recent documentary series, Through the Mirror of Chess: A Cultural Exploration, examines the game&#39;s impact on culture, art, science and sport. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Filmmaker Howard Burton said under the right circumstances, the game has &#34;considerable social benefit&#34; to a large number of people. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Meanwhile, back at the prison, Nathan sits back in his chair, thoughtfully hovering a black knight just above the board. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He is back in prison after spending time inside over Christmas and says chess is helping him get back to who he was.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I lost my way in life,&#34; he said. &#34;I had my reasons. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Playing chess is part of normal life, so if you lose your way out there, in here, doing this, can make you feel like you&#39;re normal, and not a criminal.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Last October, HMP Hewell represented England in an annual prison tournament held online, playing inmates in 45 other countries.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Joshua hopes to represent his country in the next international prison chess tournament</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The men&#39;s competition was won by The Philippines, while Mongolia&#39;s female prisoners beat Serbia to claim gold.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>New York-based charity The Gift of Chess works within the US prison system. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Founder Russell Makofsky says there has been an increase in public awareness and conversations surrounding the benefit of chess for those in prison.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This has led, he says, to expanded programming, playing and resource opportunities for those incarcerated.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At HMP Hewell another king has been captured, the room begins to empty as beaten players leave the board and return to their cell.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Carl, the man in the middle, remains focused and still offering advice as he prepares to dispatch the last of today&#39;s opponents.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="You-feel-like-youre-out-of-jail"><span role="text">&#39;You feel like you&#39;re out of jail&#39;</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>One of the last few remaining is Joshua, who says even in defeat, today has helped to relax his mind as he awaits his prison sentence. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You feel like you&#39;re out of jail when you&#39;re playing a game - you&#39;re focused on that, it just takes you out of the environment,&#34; he explains. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I come up here on Tuesday mornings and play with the staff, it&#39;s something to look forward to. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I think they are trying to sort out for me to play in the next international tournament - it would be good to represent England and do my part.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><i>Follow BBC West Midlands on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MidlandsBBC/">Facebook</a><i>, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcmtd">Twitter</a><i> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbc_midlands/?hl=en">Instagram</a><i>.
