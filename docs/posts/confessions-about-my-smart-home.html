    <h1>Confessions about my smart home</h1>

                <p>People on the internet sometimes seem to have an idea of what my connected smart home looks like. And honestly?  <strong>They&#39;re all wrong. 😄</strong> Which is odd, considering I&#39;ve shared my setup on multiple occasions–through multiple live streams, podcasts, and blog posts. Very recently, I came across a Reddit comment that stuck with me:</p><blockquote><em>“They don’t even use Home Assistant”.</em></blockquote><p>That Reddit comment has been resonating in my head for weeks. Is this person right? Am I even allowed to say I have a smart home? Do I practice what I preach?</p><p><strong><em>I guess it&#39;s time for some confessions about the state of my smart home. </em>😅</strong></p><h2 id="the-unusual-start-of-my-smart-home-journey">The unusual start of my smart home journey</h2><p>My <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/?ref=frenck.dev" rel="noreferrer">Home Assistant</a> journey was, I guess, anything but typical. If you are using Home Assistant today, chances are you started with another system–Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, OpenHAB, Homey, Domoticz, or maybe something self-built– before looking for more flexibility, power, or local control. You are what we call an <em>&#34;outgrower&#34;.</em>  In that case, you have outgrown your previous smart home system and have been looking to do more.</p><p>Here’s my first confession: <strong>I was never an outgrower.</strong></p><p>When I first stumbled upon Home Assistant, I didn’t know anything about smart homes. I didn’t have any smart devices (at least not that I was really aware of); I wasn&#39;t even thinking about automating my home at all.</p><p><strong>I was just <em>bored to death</em>. 🙈</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not even kidding. I wanted to contribute to an open-source project–something where I could apply my development skills and give back to the community. That&#39;s how I found Home Assistant. I came across some issues I could solve, and while doing that, I discovered the amazing community 🫶 that surrounded it. It pulled me in deeper and deeper.</p><p>And yes, it is true:<strong> For the first year of contributing to Home Assistant, I didn’t even use it myself.</strong> Sure enough, I had test setups for development but no actual smart bulbs or sensors in my home. <em>Who even wants that? </em>🥴</p><p>No worries–the saying is real–<strong>once you start going down the home automation rabbit hole, it&#39;s hard to stop</strong>. Eventually, I set up my own &#34;production&#34; instance alongside my dev and test setups. And slowly, more and more connected smart devices started to sneak into my home.</p><h2 id="the-ever-growing-pile-of-devices-in-my-smart-home">The ever-growing pile of devices in my smart home</h2><p>Haha, yeah, so here we go. People assume that, as the lead engineer of Home Assistant, I must have the <em>most extravagant </em>🤩 and <em>insane</em> smart home setup in the world… </p><p>My second confession:<strong><em> Yeah, well... no</em></strong>. 🤣</p><p>The reality? I have <em>hundreds</em> of smart devices and sensors in my home. But I have no idea which ones are actually connected. And if they <em>are</em> connected, I&#39;m not even sure which of my many Home Assistant instances they&#39;re hooked up to. 😬</p><p>I basically run four production instances of Home Assistant, all originally meant to become <em>the ultimate smart home</em> setup. Each runs on different hardware: a <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blue?ref=frenck.dev" rel="noreferrer">Home Assistant Blue</a>, a <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow?ref=frenck.dev" rel="noreferrer">Home Assistant Yellow</a>, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assistant-Advanced-Automation-Official-Hardware/dp/B0CXVKSG19?sr=8-2&amp;ref=frenck.dev">Home Assistant Green</a>, and one running on a <a href="https://amzn.to/4gWzxOl?ref=frenck.dev" rel="noreferrer">Beelink Mini S12 Pro Mini PC</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://frenck.dev/content/images/2025/02/IMG_5999-2-1.jpeg" alt="A Home Assistant Blue device next to a stack of three mini PCs labeled “Crash,” all wired in a network setup." loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1052" srcset="https://frenck.dev/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/IMG_5999-2-1.jpeg 600w, https://frenck.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/IMG_5999-2-1.jpeg 1000w, https://frenck.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/IMG_5999-2-1.jpeg 1600w, https://frenck.dev/content/images/2025/02/IMG_5999-2-1.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/><figcaption><span>On the left, my beloved Home Assistant Blue–still one of the best-looking devices out there. On the right, my stack of </span><a href="https://amzn.to/4gWzxOl?ref=frenck.dev" rel="noreferrer"><span>Beelink Mini PCs</span></a><span>. Compact, powerful, affordable, and energy-efficient.</span></figcaption></figure><p>To make my mess even more complete, I have a massive mix of devices:</p><ul><li>Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Matter devices over Wi-Fi and Thread. 🛜</li><li>Tons of Wi-Fi devices running <a href="https://esphome.io/?ref=frenck.dev" rel="noreferrer">ESPHome</a>, <a href="https://kno.wled.ge/?ref=frenck.dev" rel="noreferrer">WLED</a>, or other (custom) firmware.</li><li>A <em>ridiculous</em> number of cloud-based devices (😫 yeah, I know... a topic for another day).</li><li>And I don&#39;t think I own more than five devices from the same brand.</li></ul><p>Why? Because I love experimenting—testing the latest smart home tech, exploring what’s out there, and <a href="https://frenck.dev/ces-2025-my-take-aways-for-the-connected-smart-home/" rel="noreferrer">staying ahead in the industry</a>. I want to keep fueling my ideas with innovation, helping me push Home Assistant forward. There is so much interesting stuff! 😵‍💫</p><p>Imagine throwing a huge pile of smart home gadgets into your house, barely setting them up, and calling it a day. Congratulations–you now have <em>my </em>smart home. 😓</p><p><em>If you’re curious about the smart devices I actually use, here’s a list of my favorites:</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/frenck/list/2XDT5RTYYLIPU?ref=frenck.dev"><div><p>Franck Nijhof | Frenck’s Amazon Page - Found in my own smart home</p><p>Shop recommended products from Franck Nijhof | Frenck on www.amazon.com.

Kinda...</h2><p>Given the above, you can imagine that controlling devices in my home is... <em><strong>complicated</strong></em>. 😅 Some devices, I just use the old-fashioned way–yep, <em>I actually press the physical buttons of these smart devices</em>. 🙈</p><p>So for the third confession: <strong>Some parts are automated, but... badly!</strong> 😰</p><p>Heck, some automations work only partially. For example, I have an automation to turn off some devices when I leave home. But the kitchen lights? They stubbornly stay on. Why? I have no idea. It is probably a simple fix, but I haven&#39;t fixed it yet.. because things just <em>happen</em> (or don&#39;t).<em> </em> 🤷</p><p>That said, I do love writing automations–especially the old-school way, directly in YAML. At one point, that kitchen light automation reached over <strong>700 lines of YAML</strong> 🙈 Now you know why it&#39;s broken 🤣</p><p>If I had to count, I’d guess I have maybe <strong>15</strong> working automations across all my half-baked instances. That&#39;s it.</p><h2 id="my-dashboards-are-a-disaster">My dashboards are a disaster</h2><p>Dashboards are one of Home Assistant&#39;s most <em>powerful</em> features. With the new drag-and-drop capabilities, they&#39;re <strong>easier and more flexible than ever</strong>. But my dashboards?</p><p>Fourth confession: <strong>They&#39;re a total mess. Easily the worst part of my setup.</strong></p><blockquote><em>”Can you share some screenshots of your dashboards, Frenck?&#34;</em></blockquote><p>I hear this all the time. And the truth is,<em> technically</em>, I do share them–almost every month. When I write the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/categories/release-notes/?ref=frenck.dev" rel="noreferrer">Home Assistant release notes</a>, most of the screenshots come from one of my <em>own</em> production instances.</p><figure><img src="https://frenck.dev/content/images/2025/02/CleanShot-2025-02-22-at-22.05.01.png" alt="Screenshot of an Home Assistant living room dashboard. While functional, it is a mess and not appealing." loading="lazy" width="1211" height="709" srcset="https://frenck.dev/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/CleanShot-2025-02-22-at-22.05.01.png 600w, https://frenck.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/CleanShot-2025-02-22-at-22.05.01.png 1000w, https://frenck.dev/content/images/2025/02/CleanShot-2025-02-22-at-22.05.01.png 1211w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/><figcaption><span>This is an actual screenshot from my most-used instance, and probably my best dashboard… 😰</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, this means I regularly break my own home setup just so I can provide good examples for the release notes. As a matter of fact, because of it, my dashboards are so bad that if I turn on the &#34;Coffee machine&#34; switch, it actually powers on my 3D Printer. 🤦‍♂️</p><h2 id="home-approval-factor">Home Approval Factor </h2><p>I don&#39;t live alone. Mrs Frenck (also known as <em>the Ninja </em>🥷<em>) and the kids </em>have to deal with this <strong><em>madness</em></strong> too.</p><p><em>How do they manage?</em> Honestly... I have no idea 😓</p><p>Confession five: <strong>I&#39;ve never asked them... so that approval factor is non-existent, I guess... 🙃</strong></p><p>Here are a few examples:</p><ul><li>Many wall switches <strong>do not work</strong>.</li><li>Mrs. Frenck has the <a href="https://companion.home-assistant.io/?ref=frenck.dev" rel="noreferrer">Home Assistant Companion app</a> to control <em>one</em> of the instances–at least, the one with the most devices in it.</li><li><strong>The kids?</strong> They just ask us to turn things on and off. Which is really <em>ridiculous</em>.</li></ul><p>But over time, I guess they got used to it. 😓 They accept that things don&#39;t always work–or at least, they stopped complaining about it.</p><p>The fact that they’ve just <em>&#34;accepted&#34;</em> things don’t always work—that stuff is flaky, experimental, or sometimes just plain stupid—is probably even more worrying. 😩</p><h2 id="so-what-does-your-smart-home-actually-look-like">So, what does your smart home actually look like?</h2><p>I guess my smart home is best described as a real-life, constantly evolving experiment–a playground where I test devices, reproduce bugs for the community, stage demos, and create release note screenshots.</p><p>I guess I do have a <em>&#34;smart home&#34;. </em>But not in the way people imagine. And yet... I want to fix it.</p><p>Don&#39;t we all? 🙃</p><p>Every time I set aside a free Sunday to work on my own setup, it takes about 30 minutes before I realize there&#39;s something I could fix or improve <em>for everyone.</em> And suddenly, instead of fixing my own mess, I&#39;m contributing to Home Assistant again.</p><p>But for my family&#39;s sake, I <strong><em>need</em></strong> to sit down and do it right. They&#39;ve put up with this disaster for too many years.</p><p>So, to Mrs. Frenck and my kids:</p><blockquote><strong><em>I&#39;m sorry! 🙏  I&#39;ll fix it!</em></strong></blockquote><p><em>Someday.</em></p><p>../Frenck</p>
