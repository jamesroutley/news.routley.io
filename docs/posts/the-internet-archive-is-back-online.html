    <h1>The Internet Archive is back online</h1>

<p>Last week, hackers defaced the Internet Archive website with a message that said, &#34;Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!&#34;</p>
<p>HIBP is a reference to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a>, which was created by security researcher Troy Hunt and provides information and notifications on data breaches. The hacked Internet Archive data was sent to Have I Been Pwned and &#34;contains authentication information for registered members, including their email addresses, screen names, password change timestamps, Bcrypt-hashed passwords, and other internal data,&#34; <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/internet-archive-hacked-data-breach-impacts-31-million-users/">BleepingComputer wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Kahle <a href="https://x.com/brewster_kahle/status/1844183111514603812">said on October 9</a> that the Internet Archive fended off a DDoS attack and was working on upgrading security in light of the data breach and website defacement. The next day, he <a href="https://x.com/brewster_kahle/status/1844326137499177312">reported</a> that the &#34;DDoS folks are back&#34; and had knocked the site offline. The Internet Archive &#34;is being cautious and prioritizing keeping data safe at the expense of service availability,&#34; he added.</p>
<p>&#34;Services are offline as we examine and strengthen them... Estimated Timeline: days, not weeks,&#34; he <a href="https://x.com/brewster_kahle/status/1844790609573277792">wrote</a> on October 11. &#34;Thank you for the offers of pizza (we are set).&#34;</p>
