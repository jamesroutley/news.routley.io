    <h1>Jellyfin LLM/&#34;AI&#34; Development Policy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header></header>
<p>The rise of LLMs as a useful development tool over the last year or so has been significant. The power and flexibility of tools like Claude Code and ChatGPT have given a lot of functionality both to experienced developers and new developers alike. But there are trade-offs.</p>
<p>The Jellyfin project has, from day one, had a major focus on code quality - readability, simplicity, conciseness. This is a mostly manual effort driven by a dedicated team of individuals, and is motivated by a desire to fix the code Jellyfin is based off of which, without beating a dead horse too much, was extremely fragile, spaghettified, and prone to over-engineered complexity.</p>
<p>We are seeing a precipitous rise in contributors using AI within the Jellyfin ecosystem, both in the server and for clients, as well as a rise in criticism and concern about LLMs generally. At this time we are writing this policy to address exactly what we expect and desire with respect to contributions and interactions within our community that may use LLMs. These rules apply to all of our official projects and community spaces.</p>
<h2 id="general-guidelines">General Guidelines<a href="#general-guidelines" aria-label="Direct link to General Guidelines" title="Direct link to General Guidelines" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>LLM output is <strong>expressly prohibited</strong> for any direct communication, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>issues or comments</li>
<li>feature requests or comments</li>
<li>pull request bodies or comments</li>
<li>forum/chat/etc. posts or comments</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, if you are posting <strong>any</strong> of those things, the output must be your own words, explanation, description, etc., not a verbatim dump of an LLM&#39;s output. We expect you to understand what you&#39;re posting. Violating this rule will result in closure/deletion of the offending item(s).</p>
<p>An exception will be made for <strong>LLM-assisted translations</strong> if you are having trouble accurately conveying your intent in English. Please explicitly note this (&#34;I have translated this from MyLanguage with an LLM&#34;) and, if possible, post in your original language as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LLM code contributions are subject to more granularity below, but the general principle is that &#34;pure &#39;vibe coding&#39; will be rejected&#34; and &#34;you are responsible for what you commit&#34;. We will review in that vein. If the <strong>code looks terrible</strong>, it will be <strong>rejected as such</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The use of LLMs for code is controversial and open to much interpretation. These guidelines are our best effort attempt to ensure that knowledgeable developers who seek to use these tools as a legitimate aid are not overly-hindered, while also preventing an ongoing flood of slop contributions that violate our core ethos above. These apply to <strong>all official Jellyfin projects</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Contributions should be <strong>concise and focused</strong>. If the PR claims to target X, and is also touching unrelated Y and Z, it will be rejected. This includes incidental changes to unrelated functionality, a hallmark of poorly-worded or too-general prompts. Similarly, a large PR must be <strong>broken into multiple small, manageable commits</strong> for review and history purposes.</li>
<li>Formatting and quality <strong>standards must be upheld</strong>. Excessive unhelpful comments, spaghetti code, spaces on empty lines, etc. will be interpreted as pure LLM output and rejected; you must <strong>clean up the mess</strong> before submitting. Also <strong>do not commit LLM metafiles</strong> (e.g. <code>.claude</code> configs) or any other editor-created non-code files.</li>
<li>You must <strong>review the output</strong> and be able to <strong>explain</strong> in the PR body - <strong>without</strong> LLM output as noted above - <strong>what is being changed and why</strong>. Your PR body (and, if applicable, commit bodies) should be providing context to other developers about why a change was made, and if your name is on it, we want <strong>your</strong> words and explanations, not an LLM&#39;s. If <strong>you can&#39;t explain</strong> what the LLM did, we are <strong>not interested</strong> in the change.</li>
<li>The changes must be <strong>tested</strong>. The code should build and run correctly, or it will be rejected. You should also <strong>explicitly test the functionality being modified</strong>.</li>
<li>You must be able and willing to <strong>handle review feedback</strong> and implement the suggested change(s) as required. What this means in practice is, if you do not know what has been changed or why (see #3), and thus can&#39;t implement suggested changes or discuss them <strong>yourself</strong>, then we are <strong>not interested</strong> in the change. Just dumping reviewer feedback into an LLM and expecting what comes out to be &#34;good enough&#34;, is not.</li>
<li><strong>Features or refactors</strong> require <strong>an in-depth level of understanding</strong> about what is being changed and why. It is obvious to our reviewers when changes are made without the developer making them understanding what is happening. These will be rejected. And as noted in #1, the PR must <strong>contain multiple discrete commits</strong>. <em>We</em> will squash commits as deemed appropriate after review. Large changes must also follow our other development policies (discussion, review, implementation, testing process).</li>
<li>The <strong>final discretion always lies with the reviewers</strong>. If your PR is not capable of being reasonably reviewed, for any reason (over-complexity, size, squashed commits, etc.) it will be rejected, and this goes just as much for non-LLM-assisted PRs as it does for LLM-assisted PRs. You will be asked to split such a PR up into multiple PRs that each present a focused, concise set of changes instead.</li>
</ol>
<p>The golden rule is this: <strong>do not just let an LLM loose on the codebase with a vague vibe prompt and then commit the results as-is</strong>. This is lazy development, will <strong>always</strong> result in a <strong>poor-quality contribution</strong> from our perspective, and we are not at all interested in such slop. <strong>Make an effort</strong> or please do not bother. And again, you are free to use LLMs to <strong>assist</strong> you, but not as the sole source of code changes.</p>

<p>You are of course free to do whatever you wish for your own non-official projects. However, we will be enforcing the following rules for any <strong>sharing of such projects within our communities</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Any primarily-LLM-developed projects should be <strong>clearly marked as such</strong>. It is up to users to decide if this is acceptable to them or not. If you used an LLM for secondary assistance (e.g. docs, formatting, etc.) in an obvious way, we would err towards disclosure as well.</li>
<li>You <strong>must</strong> respect and follow licenses. If you are basing your project off of existing code, <strong>following its license is not optional</strong>. You must <strong>credit existing contributors in full</strong> for <strong>all contributions</strong>. Do not <strong>mangle the Git history</strong>, and do not <strong>commit pending 3rd party changes as your own</strong> (i.e. by copying the code and then committing it). Doing so will result in, not just rejection, but a ban from our organization and community. We have a <strong>zero tolerance policy</strong> for code theft and bad-faith attribution attempts.</li>
<li>For members of the community, <strong>do not report</strong> LLM-generated tools, clients, etc. <strong>on that basis alone</strong>, and do not engage in anti-LLM &#34;witch hunts&#34;. As mentioned above, this is <strong>permitted</strong> and it is your choice whether to &#34;support&#34; said tool/client/etc. or not.</li>
<li>We, the moderators, are not going to play &#34;LLM police&#34; about 3rd party projects by nitpicking to try to &#34;find LLM contributions&#34; that otherwise follow our rules here; this is tedious and a waste of our time and effort. What this means in practice is that rule #1 is up to the author, and rule #3 must be interpreted in that vein. If you <strong>only suspect</strong> a tool is LLM-generated and violates rule #1, then downvote/ignore it and move on. <strong>Only if</strong> we see <strong>blatant breaking of rule #1</strong> we will enforce it, but again we will not be going through code line by line playing the &#34;was this LLM generated?&#34; game. Rule #2 will always be enforced regardless of LLM-ness or not.</li>
