<p>If you have ever traveled overseas, then returned to the U.S., you likely filled out a “customs declaration” form on the airplane:<br/>
</p>
<p>“Are you bringing with you: plants, food, animals, soil, disease agents, cell cultures or snails? Declare all articles that you have acquired and are bringing into the United States.”<br/>
</p>
<p>Who would have guessed the regulations would have been enforced so rigorously in 1969 when three men returned to the U.S. from a rather long business trip – to the moon and back. After more than 477,000 miles roundtrip, they had to file and sign a “General Declaration” for the items they acquired on the trip — specifically, “moon rock and moon dust samples.”<br/>
</p>
<p>The flight number was typed in as “Apollo 11,” and the departure point was listed as “Moon” with arrival at Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.A.<br/>
</p>
<p>The Declaration of Health section, asks travelers to list: &#34;Any other condition on board which may lead to the spread of disease.” The answer was “To be determined.”<br/>
</p>
<p><i>(First-man-on-the-moon and former UC engineering professor Neil Armstrong died Aug. 25, 2012, at 82 years of age.)</i></p>
<p><i>Yes, the form really does ask if a person is bringing in snails.<br/>
</i></p>
<p><i>Thanks to UC alumnus Luama Mays, JD ’66, for sharing a copy of the declaration with UC Magazine. Mays was a pilot who befriended Armstrong while the former astronaut was teaching at UC and Mays was running an aviation company. Initially Armstrong called him, without even identifying himself, asking for a ride on Mays old &#34;bubble-style&#34; helicopter left over from the Korean War. It was exactly what Armstrong had trained on in preparation for operating the lunar module.</i> <a href="https://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/recent_features/armstrong/remember.html">(See entire story.)</a><br/>
