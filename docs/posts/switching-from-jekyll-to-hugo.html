    <h1>Switching from Jekyll to Hugo</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
  
  
  <p>I switched from Jekyll to Hugo as my static site generator of choice recently. The only reason I have a Ruby environment is for this site, so moving from that to a single binary looked appealing.</p>
<p>I use a specific version of Hugo by downloading the binary directly instead of via a package manager. This was a tip I got from a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/10/09/switching-to-hugo/">similar post</a> from Julia Evans. I liked the idea to be able to choose when to upgrade instead of my site breaking each time something changes with a new release.</p>
<p>Julia’s post also mentioned a way to import most of my Jekyll site with one command: <code>hugo import jekyll</code>. It moved the posts static assets (CSS, images) almost seamlessly, except for a few changes in the configuration and specific posts to render certain parts correctly. However, it did not import any of my templates, so the site wouldn’t render without adding a theme.</p>
<p>Themeing is one thing that has confused me each time I’ve tried to switch to Hugo in the past since I prefer making custom layouts. Hugo also offers a few base layout files that Jekyll did not, which took a while to get the hang of. Here’s the approach I took:</p>
<ul>
<li>I created a blank theme by running <code>hugo new theme</code> and looked up a post or two to understand the structure better.</li>
<li>Then I simplifed the theme files further to get as close to my Jekyll layouts as possible.</li>
<li>Then I moved the relevant directories (<code>archetypes</code> and <code>layouts</code>) from the theme folder to the root directory of the site, a structure that is familiar to me from Jekyll.</li>
<li>Lastly I deleted the theme folder and ensured that my site still renders correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last set of changes I made were configuration changes, and the site was ready to deploy!</p>
<hr/>
<p>On one hand, the amount of configuration options in Hugo can get overwhelming, and the templating language is also confusing coming from Jekyll’s Liquid, making Hugo’s learning curve steep.</p>
<p>Where I prefer Hugo to Jekyll is when structuring the site files. Jekyll imposes a certain filename format and directory for blog posts, and any other collections/sections have to be configured differently. I reached a roadblock whenever I wanted to create other collections or sub-collections within the post collection. Hugo doesn’t impose such structure, and lets you define your own.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to tinkering with Hugo more.</p>
