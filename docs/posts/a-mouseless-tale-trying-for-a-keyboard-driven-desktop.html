    <h1>A mouseless tale: trying for a keyboard-driven desktop</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The computer mouse is a wonderful invention, but for the past few
months I&#39;ve been working to use mine as little as possible for
productivity and ergonomic reasons. It should not be surprising that
there are quite a few open-source applications, utilities, and
configuration options that are either designed to or incidentally
assist in creating a keyboard-driven desktop. This includes tiling window
management with <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM?tab=readme-ov-file#paperwm">PaperWM</a>, the <a href="https://vimium.github.io/">Vimium</a> browser extension, <a href="https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper?tab=readme-ov-file#input-remapper">Input Remapper</a>, and more.</p>

<h4>PaperWM scrollable window tiling</h4>

<p>A tiling window manager can make it more practical to avoid using
the mouse by letting the window manager arrange application windows
automatically, rather than forcing the user to manually move them around and
adjust their size. However, the traditional tiling window manager
approach can also have downsides if one has a small screen and/or many
application windows open. If windows cannot overlap and have to share
a 14-inch laptop screen, for example, it does not take long before
windows are too small to be usable.</p>

<p>Another problem is that many of the tiling desktop options require
a fair amount of configuration and cobbling together an
assortment of tools to create a usable desktop environment.</p>

<p>PaperWM solves both problems by providing a scrollable tiling
interface for GNOME with a virtual viewport larger than the
screen. Windows are opened at the full height of the monitor and each
new window is placed to the right of the current window. If the
windows take up more real estate than provided by the monitor, the
overflow windows are simply placed off the edge of the screen and
users can use keyboard shortcuts (or the mouse) to move windows into
view as needed. Since PaperWM is a GNOME extension, users don&#39;t have
to assemble all of the pieces of a desktop environment themselves.</p>

<p>It has a configurable focus mode that dictates where the window
that has focus is placed on the screen. The default focus mode allows
the focused window to be anywhere on screen. Centered mode, as the
name suggests, ensures that the window with focus is in the center of
the screen, and edge mode places the focused window at the right edge
of the screen. It&#39;s not clear to me why anyone would prefer the
right‑edge mode, but it&#39;s there for users who want it.</p>

<p>Like other tiling window manager implementations, window operations
are easily controlled from the keyboard without needing to touch the
mouse.  Users can move between application windows using the
<tt>Super</tt> key (usually the key with the Windows logo on a PC
keyboard) plus the arrow key. That is, to select the window to the
left users can just press &#34;<tt>Super+left</tt>&#34;.</p>

</a>
</blockquote>

<p>To switch workspaces, use &#34;<tt>Super‑`</tt>&#34;. To resize windows
use &#34;<tt>Super‑r</tt>&#34;. That command toggles the width of the
window to one of PaperWM&#39;s &#34;<q>useful window widths</q>&#34;, which are
configurable in the extension&#39;s settings. For example, I have the
widths set to 25%, 33%, and 50% of the screen&#39;s resolution. Windows
can, of course, still be expanded to full screen mode with the default
GNOME keybinding (<tt>F11</tt>). The <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM#usage">usage</a> section of
the PaperWM README has a full rundown of all of the extension&#39;s options
and how to configure it.</p>

<p>It is also possible, of course, to move and resize windows in 
PaperWM with the mouse or trackpad if a user prefers to do so. PaperWM
supports assigning touchpad gestures for some operations, such as
swiping between windows and workspaces.</p>

<p>Finally, PaperWM has what it refers to as a &#34;<q>scratch layer</q>&#34;
for windows that float above the tiled layout. This might be useful
for a chat client or music player, or for applications like a
calculator. The &#34;<tt>Ctrl+Super+Esc</tt>&#34; shortcut removes a window
from the tiling layout and places it in the scratch
layer. &#34;<tt>Super+Esc</tt>&#34; will hide the window or make it visible
again, and &#34;<tt>Shift+Super+Esc</tt>&#34; shows or hides all application
windows stored in the scratch layer.</p>

<p>The project is available under the GPLv3 license and was originally
developed by Tor Hedin Brønner and Ole Jørgen Brønner. It is <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM/blob/release/CONTRIBUTING.md">currently
maintained</a> by Karim Vergnes and Stephen Michel. The most recent
version, <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM/releases/tag/v47.1.0">v47.1.0</a>,
was released in October, 2024.</p> 

<p>PaperWM is not the only option for scrollable tiling, but it has
the virtue of being extremely easy to adopt with a minimum of
configuration to get started. Other options include the <a href="https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri?tab=readme-ov-file#niri">niri</a> Wayland
compositor, <a href="https://github.com/peterfajdiga/karousel">Karousel</a> for KDE,
and <a href="https://spwhitton.name/tech/code/papersway/">papersway</a> for
the Sway and i3 window managers.</p>

<h4>Firefox bookmark keywords</h4>

<p>Firefox bookmarks can be <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarks-firefox#w_how-to-use-keywords-with-bookmarks">assigned
a keyword</a> that will open the URL directly from the address
bar. For example, if a user has bookmarked <a href="https://lwn.net/current/">the current LWN weekly edition</a>,
they can edit the bookmark and add a keyword like &#34;week&#34;. Then, typing
<tt>week</tt> into Firefox&#39;s location bar will automatically open
<tt>https://lwn.net/current/</tt>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many users may not even be aware the feature exists
because it&#39;s essentially hidden. For some reason, Firefox does not
present the Keyword field when adding a bookmark, it is only visible
when editing a bookmark after it is created.</p><p> At least, I only took
notice of this feature in 2024 and it&#39;s been <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/990929">present in
Firefox since at least 2014</a>.</p>

<p>This is particularly useful for pages that are visited frequently
or pages that one uses infrequently but are inconvenient to navigate
to. For example, it might save several clicks to bookmark the page for
filing bugs with one&#39;s favorite distribution and assign the bookmark a
memorable keyword like &#34;fedbugs&#34; or &#34;debbugs&#34;. Then the page is just
a &#34;<tt>Ctrl-l fedbugs</tt>&#34; away. To return focus to the page in
Firefox (rather than the location bar) use &#34;<tt>Shift-F6</tt>&#34;.</p>

<h4>Vimium Firefox extension</h4>

<p>The bookmark keyword trick only goes so far in helping to reduce
mouse usage in Firefox. To really reduce rodent reliance, I&#39;ve turned
to the Vimium extension, which brings Vim-like keyboard shortcuts to
the browser. It is available for Firefox, Chrome, and Edge browsers
but I have only tested it with Firefox. It is an MIT-licensed project
that has been in development for more than 15 years, with <a href="https://github.com/philc/vimium/blob/master/CREDITS">quite a few
contributors</a> over that time.</p>

<p>Once it is installed, hitting &#34;<tt>?</tt>&#34; will bring up an overlay with
Vimium&#39;s default keybindings. Like Vim, the Vimium extension is
modal; it starts in normal mode, which means that navigation is done
with standard alphabetic keys. Vim users will find few surprises
here: the &#34;<tt>h,j,k,l</tt>&#34; keys are used for directional scrolling,
&#34;<tt>gg</tt>&#34; will move to the top of the page, &#34;<tt>G</tt>&#34; to the
bottom, and so forth. To open links using the keyboard, press
&#34;<tt>f</tt>&#34; and Vimium will display little pop-up squares with letters
next to each link. Typing the lower-case letters will open the link in
the same tab, while typing the upper-case letters will open the link
in a new tab.</p>

<blockquote>

</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike Vim, Vimium does not require entering an insert mode to
insert text for forms, etc. Typing &#34;<tt>i</tt>&#34; does place Vimium in
an insert mode, but it would be better named &#34;bypass mode&#34;. The insert
mode tells Vimium to ignore key commands until the the escape key
(<tt>Esc</tt>) is pressed and it returns to normal mode. This is
useful for sites such as Gmail and GitHub, which provide their own
shortcuts that may conflict with Vimium&#39;s. Users can set up rules to
automatically <a href="https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Disabling-Vimium">disable</a>
some or all of Vimium&#39;s keybindings on specific sites to avoid any
conflicts.</p>

<p>Finally, Vimium has visual and visual line modes to select text:
&#34;<tt>v</tt>&#34; enters visual mode, and &#34;<tt>V</tt>&#34; enters visual line
mode. Once text is selected, it can be copied (or &#34;yanked&#34;) with
&#34;<tt>y</tt>&#34; as with Vim. In normal and visual modes users can copy
the current page URL with &#34;<tt>yy</tt>&#34; and select any link on the
page to copy with &#34;<tt>yf</tt>&#34;.</p>

<p>Vimium also features the somewhat questionably named &#34;Vomnibar&#34;,
which is similar in function to Firefox&#39;s location bar. Users can
provide a URL or search term, but it will also allow searching through
history and bookmarks. The Vomnibar can be summoned with &#34;<tt>o</tt>&#34;
or &#34;<tt>O</tt>&#34;, depending on whether the user would like to open a
link in the current tab or a new tab, respectively. Note that Vimium
does not disable the browser&#39;s location bar, so <tt>Ctrl-l</tt> still
works as expected.</p>

<p>After a few days of using Vimium it was rarely necessary for me to
need a mouse to do anything I wanted in Firefox.</p>

<h4>Mouseless mail with aerc and Quake Terminal</h4>

<div>
<p>Some readers may never have played id Software&#39;s original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)">Quake</a>, but
it was a very popular (and somewhat gory for the time) first-person-shooter game
introduced in 1996. It was a rarity in that it was a mainstream game
that ran natively on Linux.</p>

<p>It also has the distinction of introducing (or at least popularizing) the
concept of a drop-down in-game terminal. Players could press the
tilde (<tt>~</tt>) key to summon the in-game console to run
commands to modify the game, and then press it again to hide the
console. Being one of the few games available for Linux, it ensured
that a generation of early Linux users would carry the idea of a
drop-down terminal to the desktop.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="https://aerc-mail.org/">Aerc</a> is a relatively recent
entry in the terminal-based, keyboard-driven mail-client category. It
is extremely configurable, works well with multiple accounts, and
(there may be a theme here) uses Vim-like keybindings by default. LWN
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/993498/">covered</a> the aerc mail
client in October 2024, so I won&#39;t spend a lot of time on it here
except to say that one can happily use aerc for email without ever needing a
mouse and plow through a lot of email in a short time with it.</p>

<p>Since so much of my workflow centers around email, I like to be able
to access aerc quickly. Since I am easily distracted, I like to be
able to hide aerc just as quickly to avoid being drawn into inbox
maintenance when I need to be doing something else. The solution is
using a drop-down terminal to summon and dismiss aerc (or any terminal
application) with the press of a key.</p>

<p>Some terminal applications include drop-down functionality as part
of their feature set, but if not, the <a href="https://github.com/diegodario88/quake-terminal?tab=readme-ov-file#gnome-shell-extension---quake-terminal">Quake Terminal</a>
extension for GNOME will provide the feature. After installing the
extension, users can choose the terminal that they would like to use
with Quake Terminal and set the shortcut to be used when toggling the
terminal visibility. The default is &#34;<tt>F12</tt>&#34;.</p>

<p>Even if one does not use a terminal-based email client, the
drop-down terminal feature is useful for all sorts of operations where
one wants to run a command quickly.</p>

<h4>Mouseless Emacs</h4>

<p>I have been a Vim user <a href="https://dissociatedpress.net/2022/11/22/how-i-got-started-with-vim/">for
a very long time</a>, but Emacs is sort of the &#34;house editor&#34; for
LWN, so I made a concerted effort to switch when I joined last
year. Over time, I have learned to appreciate how much one can do with
Emacs, and it has grown on me—after a fair amount of work to
bend it to my will.</p>

<p>After a few months of using Emacs&#39;s menu and toolbar, and trying to
adapt to Emacs&#39;s default keybindings for editing text, I realized
there was no sense in throwing away more than 25 years developing
muscle memory for Vim&#39;s keybindings and gave up on that. I embraced <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil">evil</a>,
the extensible vi layer for Emacs, and <a href="https://github.com/alexmurray/evil-vimish-fold?tab=readme-ov-file#evil-vimish-fold">Evil
vimish-fold</a> to add the <a href="https://dissociatedpress.net/2006/05/24/how-to-use-vims-folding-features-on-large-files/">text-folding
functions</a> from Vim that evil lacks.</p>

<p>But there is much more to Emacs than basic text editing, such as <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/957316/">Org mode</a>. To reduce
the temptation to use the menu and force myself to learn (or adapt)
shortcuts for other operations, I added a configuration to hide the
toolbar and menu in my <tt>~/.emacs</tt>, and shortcuts to toggle
them if absolutely needed:</p>

<pre>;; Hide unnecessary toolbars
    (tool-bar-mode -1)
    (menu-bar-mode -1)

;; Shortcuts to show toolbars
    (global-set-key (kbd &#34;C-c Y&#34;) &#39;tool-bar-mode)
    (global-set-key (kbd &#34;C-c M&#34;) &#39;menu-bar-mode)
</pre>

<p>That not only encouraged using shortcuts, it also reclaimed a bit
of screen space that was taken up by the toolbars. Since I didn&#39;t need
the title bar either, I dispensed with that:</p>

<pre>;; Goodbye GNOME title bar
    (setq default-frame-alist &#39;((undecorated . t)))
</pre>

<h4>Remapping keys to mice and more</h4>

<p>My goal is to reduce mouse usage as much as possible, without going
entirely overboard. For example, there seems to be little point in
trying to cobble together a mouseless workflow for using image editors
to crop and resize screenshots for publication. It&#39;s a job that needs
doing only once or twice a week, maximum. A mouseless approach might
be possible, but the effort would take a long time to pay
off. Likewise, navigating preference dialogs or using GNOME Software
to install a Flatpak package is something that is probably possible to
do with keyboard only—but the payoff in learning to do so seems
minimal.</p>

<p>But, if a user really wants (or needs) to replace the mouse with a
keyboard, GNOME&#39;s Accessibility features allow users to <a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/mouse-mousekeys.html.en">use
the numeric keypad</a> to move the mouse pointer. However, this is
slower for me than just using the mouse.</p>

<p>I did want to remap some of my keys to be more useful,
though. GNOME is somewhat restrictive in that regard. <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-tweaks#gnome-tweaks">GNOME Tweaks</a>
allows users to remap some keys, but it only provides a set of
predefined layout options and does not allow users to create arbitrary
remappings. For example, instead of setting <tt>Caps Lock</tt> to
<tt>Escape</tt>, I wanted to remap it to the <tt>Alt+x</tt> shortcut
that Emacs uses to preface so many commands.</p>

<p>For that, I turned to Input Remapper,
an application that can remap keyboard, mouse, joystick, and other
controller input. Input Remapper sets up per-device rules to remap
keys or mouse inputs. That means, for example, that rules for a laptop
keyboard to remap Caps Lock will not carry over to an external USB
keyboard. It also means, though, that if one has a gaming keypad or
another input device, it might be used to set up really complex
remappings.</p>

<p>Input Mapper can also remap input from one device type to
another. For example, users can remap keyboard input to mouse input in
a more fine-grained way than GNOME&#39;s Accessibility features.</p>

<p>Basically, users can remap input by choosing their device, and then
recording the input to be replaced and assigning it an event
name or macro. For example, to replace the <tt>Caps Lock</tt> with
<tt>Alt+x</tt> I selected my ancient Microsoft Natural Pro keyboard
as the device, and then recorded pressing the <tt>Caps Lock</tt>
key. As output I chose <tt>Alt_L + x</tt>, then applied the
change.</p>

<blockquote>

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/input-remapper-sm.png" alt="[Input Remapper]" title="Input Remapper"/>
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>The project lists a number of <a href="https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper/blob/main/readme/examples.md">examples</a>
of macros and such that can help in getting started with the
application. It is not entirely intuitive, but after setting up a few
substitutions it starts to make sense. It might be a project best
started on the weekend, since it&#39;s easy to get lost down a rabbit hole
of customizing input devices.</p>

<p>No doubt there are many other tools and tricks to de-mouse the
desktop even further that I have yet to find. Even so, putting all
of these tools together has been a fun project that has already increased
my productivity and &#34;flow&#34; in a noticeable way.</p></div></div>
