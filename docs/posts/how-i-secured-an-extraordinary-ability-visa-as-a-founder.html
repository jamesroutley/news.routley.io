    <h1>How I secured an &#39;Extraordinary Ability&#39; visa as a founder</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I have benefitted from <a href="https://harshitaarora.com/2018/10/19/a-guide-on-getting-an-o-1-visa/?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>reading</u></a> <a href="https://debarghyadas.com/writes/eb1-ultimate-guide/?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>other</u></a> <a href="https://lisa-wehden.medium.com/a-guide-to-applying-for-the-o-1-visa-for-extraordinary-individuals-8ca5f22ff86b?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>people‚Äôs</u></a> <a href="https://nintil.com/us-immigration/?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>writing</u></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/0xSigil/status/1745815757651591204?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>about</u></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ankurnagpal/status/1746912467299586349?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>their</u></a> <a href="https://writing.nikunjk.com/p/permanent-residency?ref=blog.awais.io" rel="noreferrer">US</a> visa journey. I‚Äôd like to pay that forward, and write down my own story in case it is helpful to others.</p><p>The fact that it‚Äôs called the ‚Äúextraordinary ability‚Äù visa can make the O-1 seem intimidating. However, this pathway is surprisingly well suited to many startup founders. The visa is valid initially for 3 years, and extendable indefinitely for one year at a time.</p><p><em>Note: None of this is legal advice. It is simply me recounting my own experience, which may or may apply to you. Please speak to an immigration lawyer if you are considering applying for an O-1.</em></p><h2 id="jump-ahead"><strong>Jump ahead</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="#timeline" rel="noreferrer">Timeline</a></li><li><a href="#meeting-the-extraordinary-ability-criteria" rel="noreferrer">Meeting the extraordinary ability criteria</a></li><li><a href="#how-much-does-it-cost" rel="noreferrer">How much does it cost?</a></li><li><a href="#should-you-work-with-a-lawyer" rel="noreferrer">Should you work with a lawyer?</a></li></ul><h2 id="timeline"><strong>Timeline</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Earlier </strong>- Arrived in the USA on an L1B visa (sponsored by my employer <a href="https://www.wave.com/?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Wave</u></a>) with an expiry date of Feb 2023¬†</li><li><strong>May 2022</strong> - Left my SWE job at Wave and incorporated my own startup called Path (a Delaware C corp)<ul><li>I was permitted to remain in the USA, since I was not employed by Path yet.

I met the 4 criteria which are highlighted in <strong>bold (*)</strong> below.</p><ul><li><strong>Nationally or internationally recognized awards (*)</strong></li><li>Membership in organizations which require outstanding achievement</li><li>Published material in journals, trade publications or major media about the applicant</li><li>Has judged the work of others (e.g. peer-review, or judging hackathons)</li><li><strong>Evidence of original contributions in science, scholarship, or business (*)</strong></li><li>Has authored / published articles in professional journals, or major media</li><li><strong>Has been employed in a ‚Äòcritical capacity‚Äô at an organization with a distinguished reputation (*)</strong></li><li><strong>Evidence that the beneficiary has commanded a high salary (*)</strong></li></ul><p>Below are more details on how I met each of the criteria. In general, for every claim made in your O-1 cover letter, you should be able to produce documentary evidence, or a statement in a signed letter from a credible person.</p><p><strong>Nationally or internationally recognized awards</strong></p><p>Startup funding counts as an award, if you can demonstrate that the investor(s) were being judicious in their investment. In other words, you must demonstrate that your investors only select a small percentage of the opportunities presented to them.</p><p>At the time of my application, my company had raised $98,000 on SAFEs from friends, family and angel investors. Alongside copies of all the signed SAFEs (demonstrating total funding amount), we submitted our pitch deck, and letters + CVs from two investors showing their credibility as discerning / selective individuals.</p><p><strong>Evidence of original contributions in science, scholarship, or business</strong></p><p>I did not have to do any additional work, beyond the day-to-day work I had done at Wave in order to meet this criterion.</p><p>While at Wave, I worked on several projects that were original in the industry, primarily because Wave had unique constraints as a fintech targeting sub-Saharan Africa. It helped that I had previously met the L1-B criterion for ‚Äúspecialized knowledge‚Äù and we were able to make a similar argument here that I had worked on original, proprietary software at Wave.</p><p>As evidence, we included my employment contract, letters from the CTO and a cofounder of Wave, and press coverage showing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/sequoia-heritage-stripe-and-others-invest-200m-in-african-fintech-wave-at-1-7b-valuation/?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Wave‚Äôs success in Africa</u></a>. We also included material from a conference talk I gave at PyCon Africa in June 2019.</p><p><strong>Being employed in a ‚Äòcritical capacity‚Äô at an organization with a distinguished reputation</strong></p><p>It‚Äôs important for this criterion to show both <em>critical capacity</em>, and <em>distinguished reputation</em>. My lawyer made the argument that I met this criteria both for my work at Path, and my work at Wave.</p><p>At the new startup, Path, it was easy to show critical capacity since I was a founder, large shareholder, and board member, as evidenced by our incorporation documents. To demonstrate distinguished reputation, we showed that Path had raised nearly $100,000 in funding, and that Path had been accepted into a legal tech sandbox program.</p><p>To demonstrate critical capacity at Wave, we used the same two letters: one from Wave‚Äôs CTO and one from Wave‚Äôs cofounder showing that I was an early employee and had worked on key projects which contributed significantly to Wave‚Äôs success. To show distinguished reputation we submitted media coverage about Wave‚Äôs impressive <a href="https://randle.substack.com/p/wave?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>$200m Series A fundraise</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Evidence that the beneficiary has commanded a high salary or remuneration</strong></p><p>Equity grants in startups count towards this requirement.</p><blockquote><em>‚Äúif the petitioner demonstrates that receipt of a high salary is not readily applicable to the beneficiary‚Äôs position as an entrepreneur, the petitioner might present evidence that the beneficiary‚Äôs highly valued equity holdings in the startup are of comparable significance to the high salary criterion.‚Äù</em><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-2-part-m-chapter-4?ref=blog.awais.io#S-C-3"><em><u>USCIS Policy Manual. Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 5, Section 3</u></em></a></blockquote><p>I showed that my total compensation (base salary + equity) at Wave for the 2021 calendar year was higher than the top 10th percentile for software engineers in New York City as recorded by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151252.htm?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>US Bureau of Labor Statistics</u></a> benchmark, and the <a href="https://www.careeronestop.org/Toolkit/Wages/find-salary.aspx?keyword=Software+Developers&amp;soccode=151252&amp;location=New+York&amp;keywordSearched=Software+Developers&amp;ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Career One Stop</u></a> website.</p><p>I benefited from the frothy investment market of 2021. The stock options I was granted at Wave were issued before Wave raised money at a $1.7B valuation, so they were worth a lot on paper at the time of my O-1 application. As documentary evidence, we submitted copies of my Wave stock certificates, and 12 months of paystubs.</p><p><em>Note: you can meet this criteria by commanding a high salary at any point in the past, it doesn‚Äôt have to be your most recent year of earnings.</em></p><h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost"><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></h2><p>The O-1 filing fees were $460, with an additional $2,500 for premium processing. (Note: the premium processing fee is set to increase to $2,805 on February 26th 2024).</p><p>I was quoted in the $6k-$10k range for immigration lawyer fees (not including filing fees).</p><h2 id="should-you-work-with-a-lawyer"><strong>Should you work with a lawyer?</strong></h2><p>I would definitely recommend working with an immigration lawyer, especially if you are not <em>very</em> familiar with the US immigration system. There were several subtleties within the application process which I did not know about until my lawyer made me aware of them:</p><ul><li>I didn‚Äôt know that I had a good chance at an O-1 until I spoke to a lawyer</li><li>I didn‚Äôt know that fundraising counts as an award</li><li>I didn‚Äôt know equity grants can be used to meet the high compensation criterion</li></ul><p>I had a mixed experience with my immigration lawyer, so I won‚Äôt include them here, but here are some people I would recommend reaching out to if you are interested in an O-1 for yourself.</p><p>Lawyers:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bayimmigrationlaw.com/?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Bay Immigration</u></a> who I have heard several excellent recommendations for</li><li><a href="https://larsonlegal.com/?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Daniel Larson</u></a> has been helpful to me as I work towards my EB2-NIW</li><li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Alcorn Immigration</u></a> is a staple of Silicon Valley immigration thanks in part to their <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcasts/?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>excellent podcast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.waypointimmigration.org/about?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Amber Davis</u></a> I have seen recommended in several places</li></ul><p>Other support:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.plymouthstreet.com/?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Plymouth Street</u></a> are a tech-enabled firm helping high-skilled candidates get to the US</li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heylogan/?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Logan Ullyot</u></a> has helped hundreds of tech workers with their visas and is building a cool new tool for O-1 applicants</li><li>Soundarya‚Äôs <a href="https://www.readunshackled.com/community?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Unshackled community</u></a> is a great resource for those who want to build their O-1 profile in a community with others</li></ul><p>If you would like to see a redacted version of my full O-1 petition, or if you are working towards an O-1 yourself, I would love to <a href="mailto:awais@post.harvard.edu"><u>hear from you</u></a>!
