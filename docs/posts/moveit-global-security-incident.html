            <p>Information for Maine Residents and Impacted Individuals</p>

<p><strong>Maine encourages individuals to take steps to protect their personal information.</strong></p>



<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>We are sharing information relating to a cyber incident that exploited a vulnerability in a widely used file transfer tool, MOVEit, which is owned by Progress Software. This event has had a global impact, affecting thousands of organizations, including certain agencies in the State of Maine. While impacted individuals may receive notice of this incident separately, we are sharing details broadly on our website. Please visit this website for the latest updates relating to this incident.</p>

<h2 id="what">What Happened?</h2>

<p>On May 31, 2023, the State of Maine became aware of a software vulnerability in MOVEit, a third-party file transfer tool owned by Progress Software and used by thousands of entities worldwide to send and receive data. The software vulnerability was exploited by a group of cybercriminals and allowed them to access and download files belonging to certain agencies in the State of Maine between May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2023.</p>

<p>Importantly, as it pertains to the State, this incident was specific and limited to Maine’s MOVEit server and did not impact any other State networks or systems.</p>

<h2 id="what2">What information Was Involved?</h2>

<p>The State of Maine has determined that this incident has impacted approximately 1.3 million individuals, with the type of data affected differing from person to person. The State encourages individuals to reach out to its dedicated call center to verify if they were affected and, if so, to identify what specific data of theirs was involved.</p>

<p>The State of Maine may hold information about individuals for various reasons, such as residency, employment, or interaction with a state agency. The State also engages in data sharing agreements with other organizations to enhance the services it provides to its residents and the public.</p>

<p>The specific information involved in this incident varies based on the individual and their association with the State. However, the following types of information may have been involved: name, Social Security number (SSN), date of birth, driver’s license/state identification number, and taxpayer identification number. In addition, for some individuals, certain types of medical information and health insurance information may be involved.</p>

<p><a href="#content"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>

<h2 id="whyam">Why Am I Hearing About This Now?</h2>

<p>The State of Maine carried out an extensive evaluation to identify the individuals whose information may have been impacted. This thorough assessment was a critical component of Maine&#39;s response, as it facilitated the State in providing notifications to those who may have been affected. This assessment of the impacted files was recently completed, and, as a result, the State is now actively notifying the impacted individuals through various communication channels, including through a nationwide media press release, letter mail and/or email.</p>

<p><a href="#content"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>

<h2 id="what3">What Did Maine Do to Respond to the Incident?</h2>

<p>As soon as the State became aware of the incident, the State took steps to secure its information, including by blocking internet access to and from the MOVEit server. The State also implemented security measures recommended by Progress Software, engaged the services of outside legal counsel, engaged external cybersecurity experts to investigate the nature and scope of the incident, and conducted an extensive investigation to determine what information was involved.</p>

<p>The State of Maine is also offering two years of complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to individuals whose Social Security numbers or taxpayer identification numbers were involved.</p>

<h2 id="what4">What Can I Do to Protect My Information?</h2>

<p>We recommend all individuals take steps to protect their personal information including:</p>

<ol><li>
	<h3><strong>Review Your Accounts for Suspicious Activity.</strong></h3>

	<p>We encourage you to remain vigilant by regularly reviewing your accounts and monitoring credit reports for suspicious activity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3><strong>Order A Credit Report.</strong></h3>

	<p>If you are a U.S. resident, you are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. To order your free credit report, visit <a aria-label="Order a free credit report online" href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com">https://www.annualcreditreport.com</a> or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. If you discover information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file. Contact information for the nationwide credit reporting agencies is provided in the next section.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3><strong>Contact the Federal Trade Commission, Law Enforcement, and Credit Bureaus.</strong></h3>

	<p>You may contact the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), your state’s Attorney General’s office, or law enforcement, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. To learn more, you can go to the FTC’s websites at <a aria-label="Learn how to protect yourself from identity theft of the FTC website" href="https://www.identitytheft.gov" title="Learn how to protect yourself from identity theft of the FTC website">www.identitytheft.gov</a> and <a aria-label="Learn how to protect yourself from identity theft of the FTC website" href="https://www.ftc.gov/idtheft" title="Learn how to protect yourself from identity theft of the FTC website">www.ftc.gov/idtheft</a>; call the FTC at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338); or write to: FTC Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.</p>

	<p>You may contact the consumer reporting agencies at:</p>

	<ul><li><strong>Equifax</strong>: (800) 525-6285; P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, Georgia, 30374; or <a href="https://www.equifax.com">www.equifax.com</a>.</li>
		<li><strong>Experian</strong>: (888) 397-3742; P.O. Box 9701, Allen, TX 75013; or <a href="https://www.experian.com">www.experian.com</a>.</li>

	</ul></li>
	<li>
	<h3><strong>Additional Rights Under the FCRA</strong></h3>

	<p>You have rights pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, such as the right to be told if information in your credit file has been used against you, the right to know what is in your credit file, the right to ask for your credit score, and the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. Further, pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information; consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information; access to your file is limited; you must give your consent for credit reports to be provided to employers; you may limit “prescreened” offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report; and you may seek damages from violators. You may have additional rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act not summarized here.</p>

	<p>Identity theft victims and active-duty military personnel have specific additional rights pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. We encourage you to review your rights pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act by: (i) visiting <a aria-label="Read a PDF of your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act" href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/bcfp_consumer-rights-summary_2018-09.pdf" title="Read a PDF of your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act">https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/bcfp_consumer-rights-summary_2018-09.pdf (PDF)</a>; or (ii) by writing to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20552.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3><strong>Request Fraud Alerts and Security Freezes.</strong></h3>

	<p>You may obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and security freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file.</p>

	<p>To place a fraud alert, call any one of the three major credit bureaus at the numbers listed below. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, they will notify the others.</p>

	

	<p>If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a “Security Freeze” be placed on your credit file, at no charge. A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. You may place a security freeze on your credit report by contacting all three nationwide credit reporting companies at the numbers below and following the stated directions or by sending a request in writing, by mail, to all three credit reporting companies:</p>

	

	<p>In order to place the security freeze, you will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit reporting company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.</p>

	<p>If your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the City in which you currently reside.</p>

	<p>If you do place a security freeze prior to enrolling in the credit monitoring service as described above, you will need to remove the freeze in order to sign up for the credit monitoring service. After you sign up for the credit monitoring service, you may refreeze your credit file.</p>
