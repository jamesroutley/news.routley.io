But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we&#39;re talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,&#34; says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s now in what we call a &#39;gravity well&#39; at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl.

However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,&#34; remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.</p><p>This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.</p><p>&#34;The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,&#34; the long-retired engineer told me.</p><p>&#34;In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t remember,&#34; says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Sunnyvale Heritage Park Museum</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Could the command to move Skynet-1A have come from the US Air Force&#39;s &#39;Blue Cube&#39;?</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives.</p><p>Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility.</p><p>&#34;A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during &#39;Oakout&#39;. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?” Ms Hill speculated.</p><p>The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A’s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977.</p><p>But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an &#34;orbital graveyard&#34;.</p><p>This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites.</p><p>Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Astroscale</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>British engineers are developing technologies to snare defunct satellites in low orbits</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Attitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested.</p><p>At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day.</p><p>That might sound like they’re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it’s starting to get a little too close for comfort.</p><p>The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK&#39;s National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there&#39;s likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Northrop Grumman</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The Americans have already shown it&#39;s possible to grab a high-orbiting satellite</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Ultimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location.</p><p>Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space.</p><p>Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it&#39;s possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A.</p><p>&#34;Pieces of space junk are like ticking time bombs,&#34; observed Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>&#34;We need to avoid what I call super-spreader events. When these things explode or something collides with them, it generates thousands of pieces of debris that then become a hazard to something else that we care about.&#34;</p></div></div><div data-component="topic-list"><div><p><h2 type="normal">Related topics</h2></p><div><ul role="list" spacing="2"><li><a href="https://jameslmart.in/news/topics/c2y91pley79t">Communications satellites</a></li><li><a href="https://jameslmart.in/news/science_and_environment">Science &amp; Environment</a></li><li><a href="https://jameslmart.in/news/topics/c5y9wr365gmt">Space debris</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component="links-block"><section><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p><ul role="list"><li><div data-testid="promo"><div><div><div spacing="2"><p><a href="https://jameslmart.in/news/technology-66993647"><span role="text"><p><span aria-hidden="false">US issues first ever fine for space junk</span></p></span></a></p></div><div spacing="2"><div><ul role="list"><div><li role="listitem"><p>Published</p><p><span><span>3 October 2023</span></span></p></li></div></ul></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div></div></li><li><div data-testid="promo"><div><div><div spacing="2"><p><a href="https://jameslmart.in/news/science-environment-68903801"><span role="text"><p><span aria-hidden="false">Japan comes face to face with its own space junk</span></p></span></a></p></div><div spacing="2"><div><ul role="list"><div><li role="listitem"><p>Published</p><p><span><span>26 April</span></span></p></li></div></ul></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div></div></li><li><div data-testid="promo"><div><div><div spacing="2"><p><a href="https://jameslmart.in/news/science-environment-64864956"><span role="text"><p><span aria-hidden="false">Robot arm would grab British satellite from orbit</span></p></span></a></p></div><div spacing="2"><div><ul role="list"><div><li role="listitem"><p>Published</p><p><span><span>7 March 2023</span></span></p></li></div></ul></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div></div></li></ul></section></div></article></main></div></div>
