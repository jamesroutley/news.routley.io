    <h1>Series of posts on HTTP status codes (2018)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Because I want to get into the habit of blogging on a regular basis, I thought
it would be a fun idea to write a series of articles on one of my favourite
topics: HTTP and Webservices.</p>

<p>To start, I began writing an article for every HTTP status code. I only
realized after I drafted the first few, that the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml">IANA</a> page actually lists
68 official ones. Definitely a bit more than I thought, but I started and I’m
going to see if I can finish it.</p>

<p>I’m going to release the first few this week, and then switch to a weekly
schedule. Hopefully I can keep this going for a year!</p>

<p>Today I published the first one: <a href="https://evertpot.com/http/100-continue">100 Continue</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re interested to read the future ones or want to show support, you can:</p>
