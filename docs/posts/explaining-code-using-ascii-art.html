    <h1>Explaining Code Using ASCII Art</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>People tend to be visual: we use pictures to understand problems. Mainstream programming languages, on the other hand, operate in an almost completely different kind of abstract space, leaving a big gap between programs and pictures. This piece is about pictures drawn using a text character set and then embedded in source code. I love these! The other day I asked around on Twitter for more examples and <a href="https://twitter.com/johnregehr/status/1095018518737637376">the responses</a> far exceeded expectations (thanks everyone!). There are a ton of great examples in the thread; here Iâ€™ve categorized a few of them. Click on images go to the repositories.</p>
<h2>Data Structures</h2>
<p>One of the most common kinds of ASCII art in code is illustrating the shape of a data structure.</p>
<p>The example I started with comes from LLVM:</p>
<p>The layout of a data structure in the Jikes RVM:</p>
<p>A tree rotate in Musl:</p>
<p>Double-ended queue from the Rust library:</p>
<p>Swift compiler internals:</p>
<p>Malloc header layout:</p>
<h2>State Machines</h2>
<p>JavaScript profiling:</p>
<p>RPCs in Cloud Spanner:</p>
<p>I/O stream states:</p>
<h2>Logical Structure in the Problem Domain</h2>
<p>Control flow in an NWScript program being decompiled:</p>
<p>ECC internals:</p>
<p>Formatting numbers:</p>
<p>A quantum circuit:</p>
<p>Balancing memory management objectives in an OS kernel:</p>
<p>Subtyping relations (this is a very cool special case where the ASCII art is also code):</p>
<p>The format of a DBF file:</p>
<p>A lookup table for image processing:</p>
<p>Shape of a color function:</p>
<p>Structure of a URI:</p>
<p>A very quick tutorial on undo systems from emacs:</p>
<h2>Geometry</h2>
<p>Attitude control in the Apollo Guidance Computer (!!!):</p>
<p>Image tiling:</p>
<p>Boomerang trajectories in Nethack:</p>
<p>Rendering CSS borders:</p>
<p>Quadtrees:</p>
<p>Speed control in a milling machine:</p>
<p>Scrolling web pages:</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed these as much as I did!</p>
