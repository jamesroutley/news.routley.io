<h2 id="toc:a-little-more-about-the-project">A little more about the project</h2>
<p>I’m using <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/wish">wish</a> to serve this over ssh and using <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea">bubbletea</a> to render the interface. I’ve been working on a several of ssh games so this was all familiar territory for me.</p>
<p>Wish and bubbletea are really neat, and I think ssh is a fun delivery mechanism. Some of the other ssh stuff I’ve been working on has required forking bubbletea (stay tuned!) but it was nice to use it as intended this time.</p>
<h3 id="toc:drawing">Drawing</h3>
<p>I think the trickiest thing I’m doing here is using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_Patterns">Unicode Braille</a> for drawing. Unicode Braille symbols are a 2x4 grid of dots, where any combination of dots can be “raised” - like ⣿, ⢪, or ⡭. This is really handy for drawing with higher fidelity than typical ascii art.</p>
<p>Unicode Braille is also really cool! You can basically think of a Unicode Braille symbol as an 8-bit binary representation of a number. To access a Braille symbol, you take the bits that you want to “raise” and add that to the starting offset for the Unicode Braille codepoint.</p>
<p>I pre-rendered 5 different trees via a Python script. The server picks an appropriate tree for your screen size.</p>
<h3 id="toc:wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h3>
<p>Honestly the hardest part of this project was realizing that there are like 30 versions of “O Christmas Tree” and none seems to be the canonical version. I just a version with lyrics that I liked. I hope I picked the right one?</p>
<p>Anyway. Merry Christmas!</p></article></div>
