    <h1>U.S. Inflation Accelerates to 40-Year High</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
         <p>U.S. inflation <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf" target="_blank">accelerated to a 7.5% annual rate</a> in January, reaching a four-decade high as strong consumer demand and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-studies-find-unprecedented-impact-from-supply-chain-turmoil-11641587220?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">pandemic-related supply constraints</a> kept pushing up prices.</p>
         <p>The Labor Department on Thursday said the consumer-price index—<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/higher-inflation-is-probably-costing-you-250-a-month-11644489000?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">which measures what consumers pay for goods and services</a>—was last month at its highest level since February 1982, when compared with January a year ago, and higher than December’s 7% annual rate. Inflation has been above 5% for the past eight months as a U.S. rebound from earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic created imbalances in the economy.</p>
