    <h1>Val Town CLI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><astro-slot> <div>  <p><strong>Note: This is a cross-post from my original post at
<a href="https://blog.val.town/vtlsp">https://blog.val.town/vtlsp</a></strong></p>

<p>Introducing <strong>vt</strong>, the CLI for Val Town that lets you use your favorite editors
and local tools. Now you can use VS Code, Claude Code, Codex and more with our
super-fast feedback loop, deploying software instantly as you develop it.</p>
<video src="https://filedumpthing.val.run/blob?key=blob_file_1748008498288_demo.mp4" controls="" autoplay=""></video>
<p>To get vt,
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/">install Deno</a>,
then run</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="sh"><code><span><span>deno</span><span> install</span><span> -grAf</span><span> jsr:@valtown/vt</span></span></code></pre>
<p>With vt, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>vt watch</code> to watch a folder for changes, pushing updates and redeploying
instantly as you save</li>
<li>Remix or create brand-new Val Town projects directly from your command line</li>
<li>Livestream logs from your Val directly to your terminal</li>
<li>Manage branches, switching between separate deployments or prod &amp; dev branches
of a project</li>
</ul>
<p>We designed vt to work much like <code>git</code>, so <code>vt branch</code> and <code>vt checkout -b</code> work
just like you’d expect. But the real magic is in the <code>vt watch</code> command: vt can
resolve deltas between Val Town and a local folder of TypeScript and text files,
automatically detecting file changes like renames and modifications. As you edit
in VS Code, neovim, or your favorite editor, every time you save the changes go
live. Or, if you don’t want to live on the edge, you can use <code>vt push</code> to
explicitly push new changes.</p>
<h2 id="bring-your-own-editor---and-llms">Bring your own editor - and LLMs!</h2>

<p>vt works perfectly with your favorite LLM tools: it can even initialize a
<a href="https://agents.md/">AGENTS.md</a> file that contains all of the context necessary
to write code for the Val Town platform.</p>
<p>People are already using vt to build cool projects, like
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43681287">Geoffrey Litt’s Stevens</a>
project, a really cool AI personal assistant telegram bot, built locally with
cursor and vt. We built Val Town’s new <a href="https://codesearch.val.run/">Val search</a>
on Val Town itself, with Claude Code and vt.</p>
<h2 id="use-the-companion-browser-extension">Use the companion browser extension</h2>

<p>vt also has a companion browser extension which pairs with <code>vt watch</code> to
automatically reload the tab as you edit your Val.</p>
<p>It’s available for
<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vt-companion/jjpaicfaaobmjlcppnooejnjnbefalfo">Chrome</a>
or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vt-companion/">Firefox</a>.</p>
<p>If you have <code>vt watch</code> running, it should “just work”! The companion
communicates with vt’s watcher over a local WebSocket connection.</p>
<h2 id="we-want-feedback">We want feedback!</h2>
<p>vt is a big leap forward in the local development experience for Val Town. But
we’re always looking to improve and polish the experience. If you have any
feedback we’d love to hear it. You can join our Discord server
<a href="https://discord.gg/dPeaMwfarG">here</a>, and contribute ideas, PRs, or issues to
the <a href="https://github.com/val-town/vt">val-town/vt GitHub repo</a>.</p>
