		<p>DarkPattern.Games is a brand new website. We are starting with iOS and Android games because this is where most dark patterns appear, but we will be adding other platforms soon.</p>
		<p>Because we are new, we have a lot of games that don&#39;t have any reviews yet. This will improve over time and we are working hard to get games reviewed. Please help us by <a href="https://www.darkpattern.games/search.php">finding</a> a familiar game and submitting a review.</p>
