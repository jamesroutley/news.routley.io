    <h1>A Long Overdue Year in Review</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The last time I wrote a <a href="http://mclare.blog/posts/a-year-of-professional-development-pandemic-edition" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">post like this</a>, Iâ€™d weathered an additional six months at my job (as well as an ongoing pandemic). At the time, I kept hoping my situation would get better if I could demonstrate my skills, but ultimately decided to leave both my job and my profession for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>My career goals were incompatible with my rigid job description (and there was no opportunity to change teams/roles)</li>
<li>My skip lead told me that he didnâ€™t see any traction in software (which might explain why I wasnâ€™t supported in the software work I did pursue for the company in project downtime)</li>
<li>I was extremely geographically isolated in a small practice, and felt like the company would not unify its practices (even within the same country) to an extent that Iâ€™d be able to meet the kind of people to take on the type of role that I wanted</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, I decided to go all in on software, and do another batch at Recurse Center starting in May, immediately after wrapping up my job (However, I would advise new applicants to RC to take a week or two to unwind before barreling into zoom heavy interactions!).</p>
<p>Things I accomplished during and after my second RC batch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taught a workshop on E-ink at Never Graduate Week</li>
<li>Deepened my knowledge of Javascript frameworks (React) and learned a new one (Svelte)</li>
<li>Contributed to <a href="https://github.com/irydium/irydium" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">open source</a>! - During my batch, I overlapped with Will Lachance, who was working on a very cool interactive document framework, <a href="https://irydium.dev" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Irydium</a>. One of the best things about RC is finding out about other peopleâ€™s passion projects and being able to help out.</li>
<li>Worked more in the open (did things, broke things, wrote about what I did and what I broke) - This was scary at times coming from past trauma, but being in a supportive community like RC makes doing scary things less scary. One of the things I did was start using my full name </li>
<li>Deepened my knowledge of D3 and really got the hang of working and prototyping in <a href="https://observablehq.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Observable</a></li>
<li>Discovered a love of databases and distributed systems and went down a giant rabbit hole on CRDTs and real-time collaboration possibilities.</li>
<li>Built a full stack data visualization web application to look at infrastructure data - <a href="https://bridge.watch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bridge.watch</a></li>
<li>Worked through OO design patterns in C# and Python</li>
<li><a href="https://mclare.blog/posts/building-bridge-watch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wrote</a> about building a full-stack web application to look at infrastructure data and what can be learned from that data - <a href="https://blog.bridge.watch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bridge.watch Blog</a></li>
<li>Learned Three.js</li>
<li>Started learned Webassembly (tbc)</li>
<li>Started learning Rust (also, tbc)</li>
<li>Deepened my knowledge of C# (I found C# 9.0 in a Nutshell particularly helpful)</li>
<li>Submitted my first talk to PyCon, and got accepted! Iâ€™ll be <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/schedule/presentation/109/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">presenting</a> in person in Salt Lake City at the end of April!</li>
<li>Probably most importantly, got PAID TO WRITE CODE as a freelancer, which was obviously a major goal for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last quarter of 2021 was a particularly hard one. While COVID seemed to be waning, I experienced a set of personal and professional setbacks that meant putting off my job search for a bit (as many people know, navigating the U.S. healthcare system can be a full-time job on its own).</p>
<p>So where am I now? After having mentored several structural engineers to help get them into programming and working as a freelancer in the <a href="https://www.danieldavis.com/cads-boring-future/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fat middle</a>, Iâ€™m ready to get a full-time software engineering job. I do miss working on a team and being able to bounce ideas off others. While I often do coworking sessions these days with people that are in different programming jobs from me to stay motivated, I miss working on a common product/mission. Iâ€™m looking for mission-oriented and sustainability or community focused software (remote-first) companies, as my time for designing manses for billionaires is well over and done.</p>
<p>I care about being in an environment where I can at least sometimes share what Iâ€™m working on publicly (something I was often never able to do with structural engineering work due to NDAs). I enjoy teaching as much as I enjoy learning, and I want that to be part of my career. Most of all, I want to write code and get better at writing code! Iâ€™m keeping an open mind as to specific roles/stacks and Iâ€™m excited to see whatâ€™s out there ðŸ˜„</p></div></div>
