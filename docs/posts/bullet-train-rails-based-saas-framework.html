    <h1>Bullet Train â€“ Rails-based SaaS framework</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
          <div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Next-Generation Scaffolding</h6>
              <p>Super Scaffolding allows you to generate production-ready views and resource controllers, but it does much, much more, including allowing you to add new fields to existing scaffolds.</p>
              
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>User Authentication</h6>
              <p>Nothing new here! We&#39;ve all been using Devise for ages, so why not standardize on it and wrap it in a beautiful theme so we can build bigger and better things?</p>
              
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Teams and Invitations</h6>
              <p>
                Teams are the kind of feature where if you don&#39;t implement them on day one, they&#39;re a real pain to add later. Bullet Train&#39;s support here is industry leading.
              </p>
              
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Security and Permissions</h6>
              <p>
                We&#39;ve weaved CanCanCan into the fabric of Bullet Train, so whether by web UI or REST API, users can only access the resources and features they&#39;re supposed to.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Roles</h6>
              <p>
                After years of pushing CanCanCan to the limit, we created another layer of abstraction on top of it to help simplify the definition and enforcement of custom user roles.
              </p>
              
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Gorgeous Tailwind CSS Theme</h6>
              <p>Bullet Train comes with a professionally designed UI theme, implemented with our favorite, Tailwind CSS. And because it&#39;s MIT licensed, it serves as a great starting point for creating, distributing, or selling your own Bullet Train themes.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Rich Form Fields</h6>
              <p>Bullet Train includes a rich library of native HTML fields and JavaScript-powered fields, including button selectors, select elements with search, multi-select, file uploads, color pickers, phone number fields, calendar date pickers, and more.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Dark Mode</h6>
              <p>Not important enough for most developers to spend time on, but you won&#39;t want to work on your own app in the evening without it. Bullet Train supports dark mode out of the box.</p>
              
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Full Theme Engine</h6>
              <p>Our UI is built on top of a partial-based theme engine, so switching the look and feel of your UI is as easy as changing a Ruby gem. (Literally, that&#39;s how you do it.) It also leaves the door open to other CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap) and an entire theme ecosystem.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Simplest. Reactivity. Ever.</h6>
              <p>When data changes on the server, views update in the UI via ActionCable. Bullet Train pioneered an insanely simple approach to server-side reactivity that is now implemented and maintained as part of CableReady.</p>
              
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>REST API</h6>
              <p>Bullet Train includes a Grape-powered JSON:API-compliant REST API. It also produces an OpenAPI schema, so you can auto-generate your API documentation and client libraries. And because Super Scaffolding is aware of it, your API always has feature parity with your web interface.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Outgoing Webhooks</h6>
              <p>Not only can your users build their own integrations by subscribing to receive webhook notifications when things happen in your application, but they can debug them via a rich in-app UI.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Language Support</h6>
              <p>All strings, including those you create with Super Scaffolding, are fully extracted into I18N YAML files and ready to be translated into whichever languages you want to support.</p>
              
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Blazing Fast JS and CSS</h6>
              <p>Bullet Train is built on top of the completely modern asset pipeline in Rails 7. It compiles JavaScript with the blazing fast esbuild and generates CSS with Tailwind&#39;s recommended PostCSS-only approach. Compile times are measured in hundredths of a second and deploy times to Heroku have been reduced by minutes.</p>
              
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Third-Party Integrations</h6>
              <p>We&#39;ve included pre-baked workflows to allow your users sign up with or integrate after sign-up with Facebook, Twitter, Stripe, and over a hundred other third-party OAuth provider platforms.</p>
              
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Onboarding Workflows</h6>
              <p>As part of our default sign-up process, we&#39;ve included a highly editable onboarding wizard that ensures you can step new customers through their setup process. Nothing magical, it&#39;s just Rails code!</p>
              
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Full Mobile-Responsiveness</h6>
              <p>Bullet Train pages and workflows are tested to make sure they&#39;re fully responsive and work great on all devices right out of the box.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Complete Test Coverage</h6>
              <p>It&#39;s one thing to integrate all these third-party libraries and first-party features, but it&#39;s another altogether to write a full suite of automated system tests to make sure it never breaks on you.</p>
              
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Write System Tests In-Browser</h6>
              <p>We&#39;ve created a new system for writing and debugging system tests and makes writing new tests as easy as using your application in the browser. It&#39;s called Magic Test.</p>
              
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Blazing Fast, Turn-Key CI</h6>
              <p>The starter repository includes a <code>.circleci/config.yml</code> for CircleCI that supports <a href="https://knapsackpro.com" target="_blank">Knapsack Pro</a> out of the box, so your CI can run as fast as your one slowest test.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Framework Override Workflow</h6>
              <p>
                Despite being distributed in Ruby gems, every aspect of Bullet Train is designed to be overriden and customized on a per-application basis. Our <code>bin/resolve</code> workflow makes it easy.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>One-Click Deploys</h6>
              <p>
                Bullet Train comes with a fully-loaded, production-ready <code>app.json</code> configuration, so you can click a button and deploy to Heroku today, and newer platforms like Render in the future. Want to try it?
              </p>
              
            </div>

            <div>
              
              <h6>Future Updates</h6>
              <p>Bullet Train is built by a remote team all over the world and we ship updates around the clock. Since our functionality is shipped as Ruby gems, upgrading your application is as easy as running <code>bundle update</code>.</p>
