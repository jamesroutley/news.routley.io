    <h1>The EU made Apple adopt new Wi-Fi standards, and now Android can support AirDrop</h1>

<p>Last year, Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/ios-18-brings-rcs-to-major-carrier-iphones-but-prepaid-plans-are-still-waiting/">finally added support</a> for Rich Communications Services (RCS) texting to its platforms, improving consistency, reliability, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/rcs-texting-updates-will-bring-end-to-end-encryption-to-green-bubble-chats/">security</a> when exchanging green-bubble texts between the competing iPhone and Android ecosystems. Today, Google is announcing another small step forward in interoperability, pointing to a slightly less annoying future for friend groups or households where not everyone owns an iPhone.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/quick-share-airdrop/">has updated</a> Android’s Quick Share feature to support Apple’s AirDrop, which allows users of Apple devices to share files directly using a local peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection. Apple devices with AirDrop enabled and set to “everyone for 10 minutes” mode will show up in the Quick Share device list just like another Android phone would, and Android devices that support this new Quick Share version will also show up in the AirDrop menu.</p>
<p>Google will only support this feature on the Pixel 10 series, at least to start. The company is “looking forward to improving the experience and expanding it to more Android devices,” but it didn’t announce anything about a timeline or any hardware or software requirements. Quick Share also won’t work with AirDrop devices working in the default “contacts only” mode, though Google “[welcomes] the opportunity to work with Apple to enable ‘Contacts Only’ mode in the future.” (Reading between the lines: Google and Apple are not currently working together to enable this, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825228/iphone-airdrop-android-quick-share-pixel-10">Google confirmed to The Verge</a> that Apple hadn’t been involved in this at all.)</p>
<p>Like AirDrop, Google notes that files shared via Quick Share are transferred directly between devices, without being sent to either company’s servers first.</p>
<p>Google shared a little more information in <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-quick-share-support-for-airdrop-security.html">a separate post about Quick Share’s security</a>, crediting Android’s use of the memory-safe Rust programming language with making secure file sharing between platforms possible.</p>
<p>“Its compiler enforces strict ownership and borrowing rules at compile time, which guarantees memory safety,” writes Google VP of Platforms Security and Privacy Dave Kleidermacher. “Rust removes entire classes of memory-related bugs. This means our implementation is inherently resilient against attackers attempting to use maliciously crafted data packets to exploit memory errors.”</p>
