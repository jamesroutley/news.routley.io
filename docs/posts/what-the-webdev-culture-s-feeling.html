      <h2>A personal history of &#34;web dev&#34;</h2>
      <p><em>or:</em> anthems for an eleven-year-old aspiring web designer</p>
    </hgroup>

    <p>My website is designed in very much the same way as I have designed it since I was a child:
      by hand, with a text editor, and a browser as my primary review tool. I try to use well-formed,
      semantic HTML, and (attempt to) design around progressive enhancement, the idea that a website
      ought to be usable with just the HTML even if other assets such as styling and scripting don&#39;t load.</p>
    <p>But let&#39;s put it another way. I designed this website according to the <em>cultural practices and values</em>
      of the community that was (and still is) important to me: web designers who cared deeply and empathetically
      about their sites, so much so they wanted as many people as possible to view it.</p>
    <h2>A flashier world?</h2>
    <p>In the early 2000s, there was another competing culture: Adobe Flash developers who saw Flash as the
      ultimate design tool. They saw it so much that they sought to create entire websites entirely in Flash,
      regarding HTML as an artifact of the past (something I&#39;ll revisit later...). </p>
    <p> When Apple made the decision to
      <em>not</em> include Flash on iOS, I remember developers decrying this decision, saying that not only was
      Apple holding back the medium of the web, but that this decision would push consumers toward Android, which
      did support Flash.
    </p><p>Of course, history played out and Flash died out, which I remember being quite happy about: Flash
      had accessibity issues, Flash was bloated, Flash didn&#39;t interact well with the world outside of Flash.
      But what I had missed was that <em>the actions of a single corporation</em> were likely the biggest contributor
      to the adoption (or rejection) of a given technology.</p>

        Adobe (the creators and sole
        developers behind Flash, a proprietary format compared to HTML) saw fit to encourage Flash as
        the future of webdev. They released
        Adobe Flex (a webapp framework that was much more sophisticated than what HTML could do, and also
        more or less required Adobe&#39;s proprietary, paid Flex Builder IDE) and Adobe AIR (a
        precursor to Electron that worked with both HTML and Flash-based apps).</p>

    <h2>The great Adobe Web Design Scandal</h2>
    <p>When Adobe pulled out of web development, they took along with it Dreamweaver, a graphical
      application for developing websites that were highly sophisticated equivalents of what we today
      would call &#34;static site generators.&#34; You got a lot of things that we still don&#39;t have: WYSIWYG
      editing, templates, live-views... We spent a whole decade before we got all of that back. And yes,
      Dreamweaver cost money, but a Dreamweaver developer could whip up a lot of websites that looked
      a lot more sophisticated than a hand-written one. A shame it&#39;s gone!</p>
    <p>But I lied. <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html">because Dreamweaver still exists.</a>
      It&#39;s still being supported even. Why is it not in our toolbelts?</p>
    <h2>No one wants to be a web designer anymore?</h2>
    <p>Perhaps it&#39;s because GUI-based tools are seen as a little out of fashion in the developer culture that
      I reside within. Look, Front-end engineering is seen as a skillset orthogonal to &#34;back-end&#34; engineering or
      machine learning or infrastructure engineering, but ten years ago it was not seen as software engineering.
      This despite the fact that web app GUIs were gaining sophistication at a breakneck pace, that Gmail <em>and</em>
      Google Docs had existed since the early 2000s... JavaScript-based &#34;web dev&#34; was just not taken as seriously.</p>
    <p>And then came a proliferation of front-end web frameworks that sought to model &#34;real&#34; desktop-based UI
      development,
      MVC frameworks like Backbone, Dojo, AngularJS, and countless more I have already forgotten. But it wasn&#39;t until
      React that
      web dev really gained legitimacy, despite a lot of skepticism at the time it was introduced.</p>
    <p>Suddenly the quality of tooling increased too, and now the state-of-the-art web frameworks have very
      good tooling, in many ways surpassing their equivalents in their desktop world (like live previews).</p>
    <p>And yet it&#39;s no longer possible for a web designer to use a graphic design program to generate a web application
      or website, like they used to be able to. And when&#39;s the last time you saw someone use the term &#34;web designer&#34;?
      <a href="https://www.ellyloel.com/blog/front-end-development-s-identity-crisis/">Elly Loel</a>
      discusses her dissatisfaction with having tobrand herself as a &#34;front-end web developer&#34; because
      her competencies have been devalued, something also discussed by <a href="https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/devaluing-frontend">Josh Collinsworth.</a>
      At a time when the average human spends more time
      on a web browser than ever before in history!

        Ten years ago, I sent in a resume to a recruiter for a prominent venture
        capital firm in hope of getting some internships. I was briskly and brusquely dismissed by the recruiter, saying
        that despite my experience developing Rails and JS apps, that they were looking more for &#34;software engineers&#34;.

    <h2>What&#39;s the culture feeling?</h2>
    <p>I hope I have been able to show you how <strong>the culture defines the tools</strong>, about how
      web development was seen influenced powerful actors to invest in (and divest in) certain types of tooling.
      So what are our tools saying about our culture?</p>
    <p>Well, I think that it reflects a culture that is heavily invested in novelty and alarmingly
      neglectful of quality. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/performance-inequality-gap-2024/">Alex
        Russell</a> has written an
      <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/">evidence-based assessments</a> on how web performance,
      on average, has declined,
      despite browser engines and core web technologies becoming more efficient and ergonomic.
    </p>
    <p>All this, I think, is indicative of a development culture where the thing that matters most is
      being a &#34;10x engineer&#34;, where the thing being optimized for is raw code output, and where
      a Tech Industry buys into and reinforces a <a href="https://ferd.ca/notes/paper-charismatic-technology.html">charismatic</a>
      notion of perpetual &#34;line-go-up&#34; (I <em>wish</em> that was just unserious meme-speak) in all aspects of computing
      output.
      All while I see a lot of tooling fall short, even at the task of code generation (Why does the designer have to 
      do everything in Figma and why do I have to regurgitate it? Why can&#39;t the designer just use Figma to output code?)
      It is notable of course that all of this tooling comes to the developer at no cost. Except, I started web dev
      using my
      extremely underpowered, spyware-ridden family PC, and these days if I tried to use the equivalent (a midrange
      Android phone) to
      begin I think I would have a much harder time.
    </p>
    <h2>There is still time</h2>
    <p>All this back to my hand-written web pages. Why, despite my critical view of the shortcomings of such an
      approach?
    </p>
    <p>Because the people who invested their entire workflows around Dreamweaver in 2005 now find it irrelevant, as did
      Flash devs in 2005,
      Dojo devs in 2012, and AngularJS devs in 2014. I&#39;ve previously argued that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/blog/quine/">it was extremely
        important that I could view
        the source code
      </a> of the websites I was trying to emulate (as have <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/right-click-view-source/">others</a>). I worry about
      any sort of culture that deprioritizes simplicity, not because I believe in some sort of nostalgic idea of a purer
      past (it <em>sucked</em> to
      do web dev back then, EVERYTHING needed a workaround) but because I think when we professionalized webdev hoping
      to demonstrate our legitimacy,
      we lost out on a large <a href="https://irenes.space/leaves/2024-09-29-technology-community-idealism">community</a> of amateur web
      designers, all
      of whom were experimenting in their own way at making this exciting new technology called hypertext.
    </p>
    <p>And the good news is, these tools are still here, right? There is still a community, it&#39;s just a little
      overshadowed by the glossiness of
      <em>what&#39;s next</em>. And that community is what&#39;s important, what drew me into the idea that I <em>too</em> could
      make a website. Which is why I&#39;m
      determined to be a little stubborn about things, because I&#39;m interested in sustaining this community for decades
      to come.
