    <h1>Google doesn’t want employees working remotely anymore</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google doesn’t want employees working remotely anymore.</p><p>That’s the takeaway from an internal memo sent today that I’ve seen. Take this section:</p><blockquote><p>“We know that a number of people moved to fully remote work for many good reasons, as we all adjusted to the pandemic. For those who are remote and who live near a Google office, we hope you’ll consider switching to a hybrid work schedule. Our offices are where you’ll be most connected to Google’s community. Going forward, we’ll consider new remote work requests by exception only.”</p></blockquote><p>The email also reminds employees that they should be coming into the office three days a week if they aren’t already designated as remote, and that managers can factor their absences into performance reviews. Meta recently <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-calls-employees-back-to-office-three-days-a-week?rc=k5vrz1">issued a similar notice</a> on coming into the office to its workers. </p><br/></div></div>
