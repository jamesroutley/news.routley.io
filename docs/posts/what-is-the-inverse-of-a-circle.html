    <h1>What is the inverse of a circle?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><time datetime="2022-01-29">January 29, 2022</time></p><p>In a word, this:</p><canvas width="614" height="400"></canvas><p>In this post we&#39;ll try to make sense of what we&#39;re seeing, and try to understand what it means to invert a circle!</p><ul><li><a href="#inverse-of-a-real-number">Inverse of a Real Number</a></li><li><a href="#inverse-of-a-complex-number">Inverse of a Complex Number</a></li><li><a href="#conformal-mappings">Conformal Mappings</a></li><li><a href="#inverse-of-a-circle">Inverse of a Circle</a></li><li><a href="#enriching-the-structure-of-a-circle">Enriching the Structure of a Circle</a></li><li><a href="#rotations-on-the-riemann-sphere">Rotations on the Riemann Sphere</a></li><li><a href="#digging-deeper">Digging Deeper</a></li><li><a href="#contact-me">Contact me</a></li></ul><p>For any number <span>a</span> we think of the inverse <span>a^{-1}</span> as whichever number yields:</p><p>\tag{1.0}
a a^{-1} = 1</p><p>For real numbers this is easy:</p><p>\tag{1.1}
a^{-1} = \frac{1}{a}</p><p>Qualitatively, the inverse of a big number is a small number and vice versa. There are two special numbers, <span>a = 1</span> and <span>a = -1</span>, which are their own inverses. We call these <strong>fixed points</strong> under inversion.</p><p>There are two more special points at <span>a = 0</span> and <span>a = \infin</span>, such that:</p><p>\tag{1.2}
\frac{1}{0} = \infin</p><p>and</p><p>\tag{1.3}
\frac{1}{\infin} = 0</p><p>Now, <span>\infin</span> is not actually a real number and you can sometimes get into trouble treating it like one, but for our purposes today we can just pretend that it is.</p><p>A complex number is usually written as <span>\text{p} = a + bi</span>. It has a length given by:</p><p>\tag{1.4}
\|\text{p}\| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}</p><p>And an angle <span>\theta_{\text{p}}</span> given by:</p><p>\tag{1.5}
\theta_{\text{p}} = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)</p><p>Its inverse is defined just like before:</p><p>\tag{1.6}
\text{p}^{-1} = \frac{1}{a+bi}</p><p>But having a complex number in the denominator of a fraction is hard to reason about. How can we pull that <span>i</span> into the numerator so we can make sense of it?</p><p>A typical choice is to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate, <span>a-bi</span>:</p><p>\begin{aligned}
\text{p}^{-1} &amp;= \frac{1}{a + bi} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{a + bi} \cdot \frac{a-bi}{a-bi} \\ 
&amp;= \frac{a-bi}{a^2 -abi + abi - b^2 i^2} \\
&amp;= \frac{a-bi}{a^2 + b^2}
\end{aligned}</p><p>\tag{1.7}
\text{p}^{-1} = \textcolor{orange}{\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2}} \textcolor{ff00ff}{(a - bi)}</p><p>These components separately control the length and angle of <span>\text{p}^{-1}</span>:</p><p>The <span>\textcolor{orange}{\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2}}</span> component means <span>the new length is the inverse of the old length</span>, just as with real numbers.</p><p>The <span>\textcolor{ff00ff}{a - bi}</span> component means <span>the direction is the same, but mirrored over the real axis</span>.</p><p>Now that we have some idea of what to expect, we can play around with a complex number inverter to try and build some intuition:</p><canvas width="614" height="400"></canvas><p>Can you visually confirm that big numbers become small and that every number is mirrored over the real axis?</p><p>One cool property of complex inversion is that <span>every point inside the <span>unit circle</span> gets inverted outside of the circle and vice versa, but every point <em>on</em> the unit circle stays on the unit circle</span>.</p><p>Notice the two fixed points at <span>1 + 0i</span> and <span>-1 + 0i</span>. It makes sense that fixed points can only occur on the  <span>real axis</span>, since <span>inversion mirrors over the real axis</span>.</p><p>As a hint of things to come: What happens if you move your cursor along the vertical line with real value <span>0.25</span>? What path does the inverse trace out?</p><p>To appreciate inversion of a circle we need to understand a little bit about conformal mappings.</p><p>For our purposes, a <strong>mapping</strong> <span>\Mu</span> is a function that turns one complex number into another:</p><p>For example:</p><p>\Mu_{double}(a+bi) = 2a + 2bi</p><p>or</p><p>\Mu_{mirror}(a+bi) = a - bi</p><p>There is also a convenient shorthand for mappings, <span>\mapsto</span>, which is pronounced &#34;maps to&#34; and is used like this:</p><p>a + bi \mapsto a^2 + 3bi</p><p>Which can also be used to define a mapping or illustrate specific properties of a particular mapping.</p><p><strong>Conformal</strong> mappings have a special simplifying property: they locally preserve angles.</p><p>Locally preserving angles means that while the large-scale structure may change, the small-scale structure stays exactly the same but for scaling and rotation. That means any two lines which intersect at <span>\theta</span> before the mapping will still intersect at <span>\theta</span> after the mapping.</p><div><p><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNjEyIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjI5MC43IiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></p><p><img alt="Example of a Conformal Mapping" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Finverse-of-a-circle%2FConformal_map.svg&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Finverse-of-a-circle%2FConformal_map.svg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 2x" src="https://mattferraro.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Finverse-of-a-circle%2FConformal_map.svg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></p></div><p>This also implies that any two lines which are parallel before the mapping are still parallel after the mapping, at least locally. Even though the mapping may warp straight lines into curves, if you zoom in close enough to any small neighboring line segments they are still locally parallel.</p><p>Said another way: Tiny squares before the mapping will still be tiny squares after the mapping, though they may be shifted, scaled, and rotated. Squares will not warp into rectangles or diamonds.</p><p>From this falls an equivalent definition of <strong>conformal</strong>: Circles before the mapping remain circles after the mapping, but for scale and translation. The sizes and locations of the circles may change, but circles never get squished into ovals. These definitions will all be important later.</p><p>To test our understanding let&#39;s examine a common mapping that transforms points on the Earth onto points in the complex plane, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator Projection</a>.</p><p>We call it a <strong>projection</strong> because we&#39;re specifically mapping from a sphere to a plane, but it&#39;s just a particular kind of mapping.</p><p>If the longitude is represented as <span>\theta</span> and latitude is represented as <span>\phi</span>, then the Mercator Projection is:</p><p>\tag{1.8}
M(\theta, \phi) = R\theta + R \ln\left[\tan{\left(\frac{\pi}{4} +  \frac{\phi}{2} \right)} \right]i</p><div><p><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNjEyIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQ3NC41MzkwNjI1IiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></p><p><img alt="Example of the Mercator Projection" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Finverse-of-a-circle%2FMercator_projection.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Finverse-of-a-circle%2FMercator_projection.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 2x" src="https://mattferraro.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Finverse-of-a-circle%2FMercator_projection.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></p></div><p>Is this mapping conformal? We can run a series of tests:</p><ol><li>Lines of constant Latitude (like the Equator, Tropic of Capricorn, etc) are all mutually parallel on the surface of the Earth. So too, in this projection. <span>\checkmark</span></li><li>Lines of constant Longitude (like the Prime Meridian) are all mutually parallel on the surface of the Earth. Again, this is also true in this projection. <span>\checkmark</span></li><li>Where Latitude and Longitude lines intersect, they do so at <span>90\degree</span> angles. This is also true after projection. <span>\checkmark</span></li></ol><p>From these tests we can deduce that the projection is conformal!</p><p>There is another projection called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection">Stereographic Projection</a> which is more useful for inverting circles:</p><div><p><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNjEyIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjYxMiIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="/></p><p><img alt="Example of the Stereographic Projection" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Finverse-of-a-circle%2FStereographic_projection.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Finverse-of-a-circle%2FStereographic_projection.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 2x" src="https://mattferraro.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Finverse-of-a-circle%2FStereographic_projection.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></p></div><p>The Stereographic Projection unwraps the Earth onto the 2D plane by placing the South Pole at the origin and stretching out the North Pole to <span>r = \infin</span> according to:</p><p>\tag{1.9}
S(\theta, \phi) = 2R\tan{\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)} (\cos(\theta) + \sin(\theta) i)</p><p>Is the Stereographic projection conformal?</p><ol><li>Lines of constant Latitude are mutually parallel: <span>\checkmark</span></li><li>Lines of constant Longitude are all mutually parallel: <span>\checkmark</span></li><li>Lines of Latitude and Longitude are perpendicular: <span>\checkmark</span></li></ol><p>So yes, this projection is also conformal.</p><p>A consequence of conformality is that any circle on the sphere of the Earth maps to a circle on the 2D plane. This is trivially true of the Equator, but how about the Prime Meridian, which has become an infinite line?</p><p>Well, the Prime Meridian passes through the North Pole which maps to the point at <span>\infin</span>. That means the Prime Meridian, when projected onto the complex plane, must be a circle which includes the point <span>\infin</span>, which means it must be a circle of radius <span>\infin</span>, which looks like a line!</p><p>We can also look at the Stereographic projection in the opposite direction: Let&#39;s wrap the entire complex plane onto a sphere such that the South Pole of the sphere touches the origin and the North Pole represents all the points that are infinitely far away from the origin.</p><p>If we&#39;re careful, we can do this in just such a way that the unit circle in the complex plane maps to the sphere&#39;s equator.

We need to travel out to something like <span>+1.1</span> for the inverse to match.

The exercise we did above where we reflected a circle across the equator (<span>unit circle</span>) and then again across the real meridian (<span>real axis</span>), all of that is correct both for the points on the circumference of the circle and for the midpoint of the circle once it lives on the Riemann Sphere. We just need to remember that while the Stereographic Projection preserves the <em>shapes</em> of circles, it does warp the space inside them such that their midpoints are not usually preserved!</p><p>Now consider a circle that touches the origin:</p><div><p><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNjEyIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM3Ni42MTUzODQ2MTUzODQ2NCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="/></p><p><img alt="Circle Inversion on the Riemann Sphere" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></p></div><blockquote><p>A circle that touches the origin inverts to a circle that passes through <span>\infin</span>!</p></blockquote><p>In order for a circle to pass through <span>\infin</span>, it must stretch to the edge of the complex plane. It must be a circle of infinite radius, which looks like a straight line!</p><p>We saw this phenomenon as a special case earlier with the Prime Meridian and the Stereographic Projection, but here it appears as a general rule: <em>any</em> circle that touches the origin will invert to a line, not just meridians.</p><p>In this case we know that line passes through <span>+1</span> and that it approaches <span>\infin</span> in a manner parallel to the <span>imaginary axis</span>, so this straight line must be a vertical line that passes through <span>+1</span>. Scroll back up to the simulation to confirm this for yourself!</p><p>Let&#39;s put a bow on this topic by identifying a few more fixed points, or should we call them <strong>fixed circles</strong>?</p><ul><li>The <span>unit circle</span> inverts to itself</li><li>The <span>real axis</span> inverts to itself</li><li>Any circle centered on <span>1</span> or <span>-1</span> (on the Riemann Sphere, not the complex plane) inverts to itself.

What implications does this have?</p><p>On the Riemann Sphere, what happens if you reflect an odd number of times instead of an even number?
