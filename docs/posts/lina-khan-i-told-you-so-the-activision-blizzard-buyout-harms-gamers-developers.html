Just a few months after the deal was sealed, Microsoft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-cuts-1900-jobs-at-activision-blizzard-and-xbox-blizzard-president-mike-ybarra-leaves-the-company-and-the-studios-survival-game-has-been-cancelled/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-cuts-1900-jobs-at-activision-blizzard-and-xbox-blizzard-president-mike-ybarra-leaves-the-company-and-the-studios-survival-game-has-been-cancelled/">laid off 1,900 workers</a> at Activision Blizzard and Xbox, and cancelled the studio&#39;s long-awaited survival game; then in September 2024, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/microsoft-gaming-s-post-acquisition-bloodletting-continues-as-650-more-staff-are-set-to-be-laid-off-for-sustainable-future-growth/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/microsoft-gaming-s-post-acquisition-bloodletting-continues-as-650-more-staff-are-set-to-be-laid-off-for-sustainable-future-growth/">another 650 people were shown the door</a>.

Which is actually the second price hike for Game Pass since the Activision Blizzard deal was concluded: The FTC had some harsh words for the previous (and, ironically, much smaller) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ftc-says-i-told-you-judge-i-warned-you-bro-as-it-unloads-on-microsoft-for-game-pass-price-hikes-and-a-degraded-product-that-it-says-break-promises-made-to-seal-the-activision-merger/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ftc-says-i-told-you-judge-i-warned-you-bro-as-it-unloads-on-microsoft-for-game-pass-price-hikes-and-a-degraded-product-that-it-says-break-promises-made-to-seal-the-activision-merger/">price increase</a> in July 2024.</p><p>Khan was replaced as chair of the FTC in January 2025 by incoming president Donald Trump, so her comments on X don&#39;t carry any regulatory weight. But even if this is a hollow I-told-you-so, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a well-earned one.</p>
