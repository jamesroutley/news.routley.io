<p>When I was first introduced to a computer, my parents made it talk to me. I was transfixed by its text-to-speech capabilities and, throughout my childhood, joyously commanded it to “Start Speaking.” Perhaps it was because I was ashamed of my own speech impediment — for which I was often bullied in school — but the awkward and monotonous cadence of its voice was endearing to me, and I spent countless hours playing with it.</p>

<p>Sometime in college I realized that you could, with your own voice, ask it “What time is it?” and it would respond in its synthesized drawl. I proceeded to make this part of my morning routine, much to the annoyance of my roommates, since the feature rarely worked and required finding the exact phrasing of the prompt.</p>

<p>As I began programming computers in my twenties, I discovered that you could control these voices in your terminal:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>say <span>&#34;hello world&#34;</span> <span>-v</span> Fred
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The say command <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/say.html">and its many options and voices</a> deepened my fascination with text-so-speech. With each new technology I experimented with — <a href="https://twitter.com/Buzzed_Feed">twitter bots</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8MIiZb-Oo8">data sonificaiton</a>, <a href="https://ohhaikubot.tumblr.com/">haiku generation</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/abelsonlive/cl-meats">chat.meatspac.es</a> - I would inevitably try piping the output of my programs into say. Just to experience, once again, the childlike wonder of my computer talking to me.</p>

<p><a href="https://saysynth.org/saysynth.html">saysynth</a> represents the outcome of a lifelong fascination with these synthesized voices, sparked by the discovery of an obscure documentation website for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/SpeechSynthesisProgrammingGuide/SpeechOverview/SpeechOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004365-CH3-SW6">Apple’s Speech Synthesis Framework</a>. <a href="https://saysynth.org/saysynth.html">saysynth</a> works by harnessing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain-specific language</a> (DSL) Apple created to allow users to control the duration and pitch contours of individual phonemes, enabling the creation of musical passages with three of Mac’s built-in voices (Fred, Victoria, and Alex). By releasing it as open-source software, I hope to make it widely accessible to musicians and tinkerers alike.</p>

<p>But while I’m excited for people to play around and build on top of <a href="https://saysynth.org/saysynth.html">saysynth</a>, I’m happy if I end up being the only one who ever uses it. Sometimes the greatest joy in creation is satisfying your own curiosity.</p>

<p>I still have many features planned, including pitch modulation, real-time midi control, and hopefully a UI or interactive website. And with each release, I hope to create new demos! Give them a a listen and let me know what you think. xx</p>
