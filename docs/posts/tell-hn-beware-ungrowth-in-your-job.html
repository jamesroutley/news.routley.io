    <h1>Tell HN: Beware &#39;Ungrowth&#39; in Your Job</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m in a situation where my boss really doesn&#39;t get me or understand what I specifically bring to the table. She simply needs something different. I&#39;ve tried to fit myself into what she needs like a square peg in a round hole. I have a very different vision for my role, and a specific understanding of how my strengths contribute to our team.</p><p>After a year of trying, coaching, assuming I’m the problem, talking to my skip level, hard convos with my boss, and much more etc I&#39;m finally realizing trying to force myself into something that&#39;s simply not going to fit. With all humility I admit it may be me that failed. But life is short, it’s time to move on.</p><p>Cool story bro, why are you telling me?</p><p>Well I just want to say, the industry has an obsession with &#34;growth&#34; in performance reviews. But the reality is that growth only works when you build on someone&#39;s strengths. Trying to ask someone to grow by changing who they fundamentally are, leads to withdrawal, stagnation, and anti-growth. I&#39;m actually getting worse at my job, not better, because I&#39;m being forced to be something I&#39;m not. It&#39;s depressing, draining, and frustrating. I can&#39;t be who I fundamentally am in my role.</p><p>It&#39;s important to know when your strengths are fundamentally misaligned with your job, boss, etc and leave ASAP. Don&#39;t try to force yourself to fit into it for the sake of &#34;growth&#34;. You&#39;ll only drain yourself and there are better places for you. You may end up going through a traumatic experience that actually causes you to LOSE skills and abilities.</p><p>That is all, thanks.</p></div></div></div>
