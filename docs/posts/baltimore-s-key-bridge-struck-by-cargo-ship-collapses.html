    <h1>Baltimore&#39;s Key Bridge struck by cargo ship, collapses</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
					Six construction workers are presumed dead following the collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge early Tuesday. Coast guard officials said around 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, nearly 18 hours after the bridge collapsed, that the six people are still unaccounted for. Those people are presumed dead, authorities say, and a search and rescue mission is now a recovery mission.THE LATEST RIGHT NOW:• Officials confirmed six people who are missing after the collapse are presumed dead• Two people were initially rescued -- one declined treatment and another was taken to, and subsequently discharged from, Shock Trauma• Preliminary investigation shows this was not intentional• Gov. Wes Moore said the crew on the ship notified authorities that they had lost power.• Moore said between a Mayday call and the collapse, officials stopped the flow of traffic so that more cars were not on the bridge, potentially saving lives• Baltimore Beltway\I-695 closed from Glen Burnie to Dundalk (traffic map here)Maryland Gov. Wes Moore declared a state of emergency after a cargo ship, the cargo ship &#34;Dali,&#34; crashed into a support structure of the 1.6-mile bridge that carried the Baltimore Beltway\Interstate 695 over the Patapsco River. Its collapse was reported around 1:30 a.m. Tuesday.Video posted online shows the entire structure breaking apart in several locations and collapsing. The Associated Press reported the ship caught fire, and thick, black smoke billowed from it. SkyTeam 11 reported the portion of the bridge that collapsed was the steel superstructure and that the concrete bridge appeared to remain intact. 6 presumed deadAfter nearly 18 hours of searching, six people are presumed dead. A group of construction workers was on the bridge when it collapsed, officials said. Six of those individuals are unaccounted for.&#34;Based on the length of time that we&#39;ve gone in the search, the extensive search efforts we&#39;ve put into it, the water temperature, we do not believe that we are going to find any of these individuals alive, and so this evening around 7:30, we are going to suspend active search and rescue efforts,&#34; said U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath.Gilreath said those recovery efforts will resume Wednesday morning.  The crash happened in the middle of the night, long before the busy morning commute on the bridge that was used by 12 million vehicles last year. The six people still unaccounted for were part of a construction crew filling potholes on the bridge, said Paul Wiedefeld, the state’s transportation secretary.To the families of those missing, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Tuesday afternoon at a news conference: &#34;We are here with you every step of the way. We are praying with you.&#34;&#34;This is an excruciating day for several families who woke up today to news that no one wants to receive. They are hoping and praying, and we are hoping and praying with them. We are all putting our arms around the city of Baltimore,&#34; U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon.Port of Baltimore operationsThe Maryland Port Administration suspended vessel traffic into and out of the Port of Baltimore until further notice. The port is not shut down and they are still processing trucks inside of the terminals.Starting Wednesday, the New Vail Street gate will close until further notice.

It will close at the normal time of 4:30 p.m.The Seagirt Marine Terminal will be closed on Good Friday.Authorities: No credible information to suggest terrorismBaltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley said there is no intelligence or any indication that the incident was intentional.The FBI released the following statement, saying: &#34;There is no specific and credible information to suggest any ties to terrorism at this time. The investigation is ongoing. FBI Baltimore will continue to support our partners at the local, state and federal levels.&#34;Video below captures collapse of Key BridgeThe ship underwent 27 inspections since the Dali came into service in 2016.
