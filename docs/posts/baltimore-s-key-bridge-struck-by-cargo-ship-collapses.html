					The governor said a search-and-rescue operation remains underway Tuesday afternoon, hours after Baltimore&#39;s Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed as a result of a ship strike.THE LATEST RIGHT NOW:• Officials confirmed six people are still unaccounted for; search and rescue continues• Two people were initially rescued -- one declined treatment and another was taken to, and subsequently discharged from, Shock Trauma• Preliminary investigation shows this was not intentional• Gov. Wes Moore said the crew on the ship notified authorities that they had lost power.• Moore said between a Mayday call and the collapse, officials stopped the flow of traffic so that more cars were not on the bridge, potentially saving lives.• Baltimore Beltway\I-695 closed from Glen Burnie to Dundalk (traffic map here)Maryland Gov. Wes Moore declared a state of emergency after a cargo ship the cargo ship &#34;Dali&#34; crashed into a support structure of the 1.6-mile bridge that carried the Baltimore Beltway\Interstate 695 over the Patapsco River. Its collapse was reported around 1:30 a.m. Tuesday.Video posted online shows the entire structure breaking apart in several locations and collapsing. The Associated Press reported the ship caught fire, and thick, black smoke billowed from it.&#34;A ship hit it and it&#39;s gone. We thought it was an earthquake,&#34; a person in the area told 11 News.SkyTeam 11 reported the portion of the bridge that collapsed was the steel superstructure and that the concrete bridge appeared to remain intact. Port of Baltimore operationsThe Maryland Port Administration suspended vessel traffic into and out of the Port of Baltimore until further notice. The port is not shut down and they are still processing trucks inside of the terminals.Starting Wednesday, the New Vail Street gate will close until further notice. All truck traffic must enter through the Seagirt main gate at 2600 Broening Highway.The Seagirt main gate will not be extended to 5:30 p.m. on Thursday as previously scheduled. It will close at the normal time of 4:30 p.m.The Seagirt Marine Terminal will be closed on Good Friday.Authorities: No credible information to suggest terrorismBaltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley said there is no intelligence or any indication that the incident was intentional.The FBI released the following statement, saying: &#34;There is no specific and credible information to suggest any ties to terrorism at this time. The investigation is ongoing. FBI Baltimore will continue to support our partners at the local, state and federal levels.&#34;Video below captures collapse of Key BridgeThe ship underwent 27 inspections since the Dali came into service in 2016. There were no issues until June, when Chilean authorities found deficiencies in propulsion and the auxiliary machinery.DHS said the Dali lost propulsion as it left Baltimore Harbor, which makes the June inspection particularly interesting.Search for survivorsState authorities said the ship alerted the Maryland Department of Transportation that it had lost power and was headed toward the bridge, prompting officials to close the bridge to traffic before the structure was struck.However, there was a work crew on the bridge at the time of the collapse and as many as six people were unaccounted for, Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld confirmed.&#34;This is an active search-and-rescue mission. We know there were individuals on the bridge at the time of the collapse working on the bridge, contractors for us,&#34; Wiedefeld said.&#34;This is very much still a search-and-rescue mission. We are still actively searching for survivors,&#34; Moore said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. &#34;There is not a single resource we will hold off on deploying, I&#39;ve already deployed air, land and sea resources.&#34;To the families of those missing, the governor said Tuesday afternoon at a news conference: &#34;We are here with you every step of the way. We are praying with you.&#34;&#34;This is an excruciating day for several families who woke up today to news that no one wants to receive. They are hoping and praying, and we are hoping and praying with them. We are all putting our arms around the city of Baltimore,&#34; U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon.&#34;This is a dire emergency,&#34; Baltimore fire spokesman Kevin Cartwright said. &#34;Our focus right now is trying to rescue and recover these people.&#34;Baltimore City Fire Chief James Wallace said at 6:30 a.m. that two others were rescued from the water so far.

National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said during a news conference Tuesday afternoon said investigators are standing by to keep the way clear for search-and-rescue operations by the Coast Guard.State of emergencyThe governor&#39;s office released a statement, saying: &#34;My office is in close communication with U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski and the Baltimore Fire Department as emergency personnel are on the scene following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.Video below: &#34;Still actively looking for survivors&#34; - Officials update on Key Bridge&#34;I have declared a state of emergency here in Maryland and we are working with an interagency team to quickly deploy federal resources from the Biden administration.&#34;We are thankful for the brave men and women who are carrying out efforts to rescue those involved and pray for everyone&#39;s safety.&#34;We will remain in close contact with federal, state, and local entities that are carrying out rescue efforts as we continue to assess and respond to this tragedy.&#34;Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency in Baltimore City in response to the collapse starting at 9 a.m. and will remain in place for 30 days, which enables the mobilization of emergency services and resources.Video below: Gov.
