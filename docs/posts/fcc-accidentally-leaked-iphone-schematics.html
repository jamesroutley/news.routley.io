    <h1>FCC Accidentally Leaked iPhone Schematics</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-article-body="true"><p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://fccid.io/BCG-E8726A/Schematics/A3212-A3408-A3409-A3410-System-Electrical-Schematics-V1-0-8024509" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recently published a 163-page PDF;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"><ins>recently published a 163-page PDF</ins></a> showing the electrical schematics for the iPhone 16e, despite Apple specifically requesting them to be confidential. This was most likely a mistake on the part of the FCC, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/09/29/fcc-mistakenly-leaks-confidential-iphone-16e-schematics?utm_source=feedly" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to a report by AppleInsider;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>AppleInsider</ins></em></a>.</p><p>The agency also distributed a cover letter from Apple alongside the schematics, which is dated September 16, 2024. This letter verifies the company&#39;s request for privacy, indicating that the documents contain &#34;confidential and proprietary trade secrets.&#34; The cover letter asks for the documents to be withheld from public view &#34;indefinitely.&#34; Apple even suggested that a release of the files could give competitors an &#34;unfair advantage.&#34;</p><p>To that end, the documents feature full schematics of the iPhone 16e. These include block diagrams, electrical schematic diagrams, antenna locations and more. Competitors could simply buy a handset and open it up to get to this information, as the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html" data-ylk="slk:iPhone 16e came out back in February;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"><ins>iPhone 16e came out back in February</ins></a>, but this leak would eliminate any guesswork. However, Apple is an extremely litigious company when it comes to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-wins-250-in-masimo-smartwatch-patent-case-150020340.html" data-ylk="slk:stuff like patent infringement;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"><ins>stuff like patent infringement</ins></a>.</p><p>The FCC hasn&#39;t addressed how this leak happened or what it intends to do about it. <em>AppleInsider&#39;s</em> reporting suggested that this probably happened due to an incorrect setting in a database. This was likely not an intentional act against Apple, which tracks given that the company has been especially supportive of the Trump administration. CEO Tim Cook even <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/engadget-podcast-apple-bows-to-the-trump-regime-again-113025360.html" data-ylk="slk:brought the president a gold trophy;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"><ins>brought the president a gold trophy</ins></a> for being such a good and important boy.</p></div></div>
