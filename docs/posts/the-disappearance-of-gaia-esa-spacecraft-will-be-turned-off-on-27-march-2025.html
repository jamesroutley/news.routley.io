  <p>2023-08-24 <strong>Gaia mission news</strong></p>
  <p>Gaia continues to operate nominally toward its 10th launch anniversary on 19 December this year. The current estimate of the remaining lifetime is about 1.5 years. In the first quarter of 2025 Gaia is expected to run out of cold gas, the gas used to maintain its highly precise scanning attitude.</p>
  <p>Data processing performed by Gaia DPAC is progressing nominally toward <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/web/gaia/release">Gaia DR4</a><add here="" link="" page="" release="" schedule="" to="">. The release is expected not before the end of 2025 and contains catalogues and data obtained during the first 66 months of operations. </add></p>
  <p><add here="" link="" page="" release="" schedule="" to="">Data processing for the final Gaia DR5 will start immediately after the end of spacecraft operations. ESA and the leading funding agencies supporting Gaia DPAC have extended the Multi-Lateral Agreement to ensure the delivery of Gaia DR5 that is anticipated not before the end of 2030.</add></p>

    <p>2022-08-11 <strong>Gaia reveals the past and future of the Sun</strong></p>
    <p>Published now on <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia/Gaia_reveals_the_past_and_future_of_the_Sun">esa.int/gaia</a> a new story on Gaia&#39;s solar analogues, giving insight in the possible past and future of the Sun.</p>
    <p>We all wish that we could sometimes see into the future. Now, thanks to the very latest data from ESA’s star mapping Gaia mission, astronomers can do just that for the Sun. By accurately identifying stars of similar mass and composition, they can see how our Sun is going to evolve in the future. And this work extends far beyond a little astrophysical clairvoyance.</p>

  <p>08/03/2021 <strong>Gaia-TESS collaboration kicks off</strong></p>
  <p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite">TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite)</a> is a NASA space mission surveying nearby bright stars in search of extrasolar planets, pushing ahead the fast-growing and exciting study of planets outside our solar system. TESS finds planets that cross our line of sight to their host stars, causing a periodic dimming of the observed light of the system. TESS is issuing a monthly list of newly discovered candidates of transiting exoplanets. However, TESS angular resolution allows light of each target star to be blended with the light from nearby sources. Therefore, follow-up photometric observations are required in order to exclude apparent transits caused by blending with nearby eclipsing binary stars, before further confirmation observations should be performed.</p>
  <p>The Gaia mission has been accumulating brightness measurements of billions of stars, with a high angular resolution, producing distinct brightness time series for all sources whose light might be blended with the TESS planet-host candidate. Therefore, Gaia can quickly identify false positive candidates and even confirm true planets in some cases, synergistically combining the capabilities of two of the astronomical space flagships of the USA and Europe – TESS and Gaia.</p>
  <p>The analysis of the Gaia relevant data is done at Tel Aviv University by Aviad Panahi, Tsevi Mazeh and Shay Zucker as members of the Gaia DPAC/CU7 team, and the results are reported to the <a href="https://tess.mit.edu/science-area/">TESS Quick Look Pipeline</a> manager at MIT and <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/followup.html">TESS Follow-up Observing Program</a> Working Group (TFOPWG) coordinator.</p>

  <p>Milky Way&#39;s warp caused by Galactic collision, Gaia suggests: Astronomers have pondered for years why our galaxy, the Milky Way, is warped. Data from ESA&#39;s star-mapping satellite Gaia suggest the distortion might be caused by an ongoing collision with another, smaller, galaxy, which sends ripples through the galactic disc like a rock thrown into water.

  <p>26/09/2019 <strong>Update to the <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/release">Gaia data release scenario</a></strong></p>
  <p>Data processing toward Gaia (E)DR3 continues to progress within the announced schedule. However, to ensure sufficient quality of the quasars and extended objects results, an additional processing run has to be scheduled moving their outcome from Gaia EDR3 to Gaia DR3. Another modification concerns a new data product. A pencil beam survey with (integrated) epoch photometry of all sources (variable and non-variable) will be added to <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/release">Gaia DR3</a>. The selected field is centred on the Andromeda Galaxy. The cone with 5.5 degree radius contains in total about 1 million sources both in M31 and the Milky Way. In order not to impact the release schedule, only a limited amount of explicit validation will be done on the pencil beam epoch photometry.</p>

  <p>07/04/2019 <strong>Rethinking everything we know about star clusters</strong></p>
  <p>Recently an overview article appeared on ESA Science &amp; Technology discussing the role of Gaia in our knowledge of star clusters. By studying stellar clusters, Gaia reveals much about the formation and evolution of stars in our surroundings.

  <p>22/02/2019 <strong>Update to the Gaia DR2 known issues</strong></p>
  <p>Today an update to the Gaia DR2 known issues was published discussing Gaia DR2 photometry. We advise you to <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr2-known-issues" target="_self">read through this topic</a> if you use Gaia DR2 photometry.</p>
  
  <p>31/01/2019 <strong>Update to Gaia DR2 known issues page on radial velocities</strong></p>
  <p>Today on ArXiv a paper appeared by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10460" target="_blank">Boubert et al.  </a>describing potential contamination of radial velocities in crowded regions. A summary has been added to our <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr2-known-issues" target="_blank">Gaia DR2 Known Issues</a> page, along with links to the paper and the accompanying data. The page also describes other topics like astrometry and crossmatches, and complements the <a href="https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/index.html" target="_blank">Gaia DR2 data release documentation</a>.</p>
  
  <p>29/01/2019 <strong>Gaia Data Release 3 split into two parts</strong></p>
  <p>The Gaia data processing toward Gaia DR3 is progressing at full speed. Although the schedule has stabilised, there are several uncertainties as many elements of the pipelines will see the real data in an operational environment for the first time. Taking the uncertainties into account brought the schedule of the next release toward the end of the earlier announced period of the first half of 2021.</p>
  <p>To mitigate the impact on research, the Gaia DR3 will be split into two releases. This way, data that is ready earlier, will be released earlier. The early release, Gaia EDR3, contains astrometry and (integrated) photometry i.e. positions, parallaxes, proper motions, G-band fluxes as well as integrated red- (RP) and blue-band (BP) fluxes, all based on 34 months of data resulting in better accuracy with respect to Gaia DR2. First results for a predefined list of quasars and extended objects may also be included already in the early release. Gaia EDR3 will take place in Q3 of 2020.</p>
  <p>Gaia DR3, which is anticipated to take place during the second half of 2021, will supersede Gaia EDR3. This means that the source list and any data published in Gaia EDR3 will not change, but is simply copied to Gaia DR3. Therefore Gaia DR3 is based on the same 34 months of mission data as for Gaia EDR3. The additional products include:</p>

        <p>On Thursday 5 October an important and rare astronomical event will take place: Triton will be occulting a star (called UCAC4 410-143659 or GaiaDR2 2610107907030969600). This stellar occultation will be visible from Europe across the Atlantic to the USA. <a href="http://lesia.obspm.fr/lucky-star/predictions/2017/Triton/html/2017-10-05-23h51m46s_Triton_GDR2_JPLnep081de430.html" target="_blank">A predicted occultation path</a> has been computed using <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/news_20170523" target="_blank">the preliminary Gaia DR2 position and proper motion for this star</a>.</p>
        <p>The Triton position can, however, still be improved. In order to maximise the scientific output of the occultation event, we have decided to release astrometry for 119 stars in the field surrounding Triton at this moment. The most suitable stars between magnitudes 12 and 17 have been chosen for astrometric calibration purposes. Please note that full validation of the data is not yet done and therefore some caution is required when interpreting the results. Nevertheless, we believe the data will allow improvement of the occultation prediction.</p>
        <p>Scientists using these data to improve Triton astrometry are encouraged to make their deduced positions public so that science return can be maximised for all groups observing the event. <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/gaia-helpdesk" target="_self">Please keep us informed</a> of your efforts and results in this topic.</p>
