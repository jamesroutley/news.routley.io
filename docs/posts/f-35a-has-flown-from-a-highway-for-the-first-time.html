    <h1>F-35A has flown from a highway for the first time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks" id="incArticle"><p>Norway has become the first country to demonstrate the ability of the conventional takeoff and landing <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/43722/750-f-35s-now-delivered-navy-to-put-some-of-its-oldest-test-models-into-storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">F-35A Joint Strike Fighter</a> to operate from a highway as part of an exercise in Finland. The U.S. Marine Corps has already shown its ability to use its short and vertical takeoff and landing <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/the-f-35b-can-eject-its-pilot-automatically" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">capable F-35Bs</a> in this way, as <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/f-35b-just-touched-down-on-the-old-pacific-coast-highway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The War Zone</em> has previously reported</a>. </p><p>Suitable roadways offer air forces <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/cockpit-view-of-flying-from-finlands-new-highway-runway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">valuable alternative operating locations</a> in the event their main bases are struck or otherwise rendered unusable and a way to readily disperse aircraft to help reduce their vulnerability. The tactic is also valuable when to comes to complicating the enemy&#39;s targeting cycles and war planning. </p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"><div><div></div></div><span data-rawhtml="1">Norwegian F-35s taxi on a road in Finland. <em>Finnish Defense Forces</em> </span></figure><p>&#34;This is a milestone, not only for the Norwegian Air Force, but also for the Nordic countries and for NATO,&#34; Major General Rolf Folland, Chief of the Royal Norwegian Air Force, <a href="https://www.forsvaret.no/en/news/press/norwegian-f-35-landed-on-a-highway-in-finland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a press release</a> today. &#34;This demonstrates our ability to execute a concept of dispersal. Fighter jets are vulnerable on the ground, so by being able to use small airfields – and now motorways – [we can] increase our survivability in war.&#34;</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"><div><div></div></div><span data-rawhtml="1">A Norwegian F-35A comes in to land on a highway in Finland. <em>Finnish Air Force</em> </span></figure><p>Norweigan F-35As have been training to conduct highway operations in Finland this week as part of the latest iteration of that country&#39;s annual Baana road base exercise, which kicked off on Monday. The jets were also <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/41562/arctic-pit-stop-a-first-for-british-typhoon-fighter-jets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#34;hot pit&#34; refueled</a> as part of the training, which means their engines remained running while they had fuel uploaded. This reduces the time required to get them back up in the air afterward and can further reduce vulnerability, as well as increase sortie rates during surges in operations. Sometimes crew changes can also occur. Just shutting down complex fighter aircraft can increase the chances that they will have serviceability issues starting up again.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"><div><div></div></div><span data-rawhtml="1">Finnish personnel hotpit refuel a Norwegian F-35A during Baana 23. <em>Finnish Defense Forces</em> </span></figure><p>For Baana 23, a section of Finland&#39;s Regional Road 551 between the towns of Karttula and Tervo in the southern end of the country has been turned into an impromptu air base. </p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"><div><div></div></div><span data-rawhtml="1">An annotated satellite image showing the stretch of Regional Road 551 in Finland where Baana 23 is taking place. <em>Google Earth</em> </span></figure><p>&#34;The Air Force trains regularly operations from other than a home base to be capable of a quick dispersal across the country, when necessary,&#34; a <a href="https://puolustusvoimat.fi/en/-/1951206/air-force-exercise-baana-23-in-tervo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release about the exercise</a> from the Finnish Defence Forces said. &#34;Operation at road bases is part of the training of all Air Force pilots.&#34;</p><p>From the pictures and videos that have been released, no special measures appear to have been taken to enable Norway&#39;s F-35As to take off and land from Regional Road 551. Norwegian Joint Strike Fighters are somewhat unique in that they are the only ones in service today that have drag chutes. This feature, which is <a href="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/blog/guest-author/blank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also set to be incorporated</a> into <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/43458/heres-how-finland-justified-its-decision-to-buy-64-f-35-stealth-fighters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future Finnish</a> and <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/canada-closes-deal-for-88-f-35s-to-finally-replace-its-aging-cf-18s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian F-35As</a>, is there to help the jets land safely in poor winter weather conditions. It also allows for less wear-and-tear on braking systems. This could be a relevant capability for road and other short-field operations, as well, but there is no indication this feature has been employed during Baana 23. The F-35&#39;s chute is packed into a stealthy fairing between its twin tails.</p><p>Finnish <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/33855/more-than-half-of-finlands-f-18-hornets-take-part-in-an-elephant-walk-readiness-drill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">F-18C/D Hornet fighters</a> and <a href="https://ilmavoimat.fi/documents/1951206/2016308/Finnish+Air+Force+Fact+Sheet+-+Pilatus+PC-12+NG+(JAN+18).pdf/37cd924e-0b91-4337-ae25-18277c5e7b1d/Finnish+Air+Force+Fact+Sheet+-+Pilatus+PC-12+NG+(JAN+18).pdf?t=1514888009000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC-12NG</a> light utility aircraft, along with <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/41562/arctic-pit-stop-a-first-for-british-typhoon-fighter-jets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoons</a> from the United Kingdom, have also been taking part in Baana 23. This exercise also marks the first time RAF Typhoons have operated from roads in Finland.</p><p>The idea of using roads as temporary runways, especially in the event that established air bases are taken out, or if the risk of that happening is high, is not new. As noted, Baana is an annual exercise and Finland <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/cockpit-view-of-flying-from-finlands-new-highway-runway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has a long history</a> of being prepared to do just this.
