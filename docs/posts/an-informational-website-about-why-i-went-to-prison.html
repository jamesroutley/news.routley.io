    <h1>An informational website about why I went to prison</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>This is an informational website about why I went to prison, and my prison experience. In short, I had a sports streaming
website from 2016-2021.</p>

<p>I self-surrendered to FCI Thomson in January 2024, and was released about 18 months later in August of 2025.</p>

<p>Most of the websites that carried information about my charges or my sentencing were inaccurate at best. The TorrentFreak 
articles were probably the most accurate. I hope to provide some much-needed context.</p>
