    <h1>Slidge – XMPP bridges</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>After one year and a half of development, including a very long pause,
a few rewrites, and thanks to my summer vacations, I am proud to
announce the release of <a href="https://sr.ht/~nicoco/slidge">slidge</a> version
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~nicoco/slidge/archive/v0.1.0-beta0.tar.gz">0.1.0-beta0</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://nicoco.fr/blog/2022/09/04/slidge-first-beta/santa.jpg" alt="Early Christmas this year, slidge beta is already out!"/></p>
<p>Slidge lets you use your usual <a href="https://xmpp.org/software/clients/">XMPP client</a>
to communicate with your buddies on
other &#34;<a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0100.html"><em>legacy</em></a>&#34; instant messaging networks, 
much like <a href="https://spectrum.im/">spectrum2</a>, but without libpurple, and targeted at XMPP exclusively.
It is an <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0114.html">XMPP server component</a>,
acting as an alternative client using your legacy credentials.
Your legacy contacts are assigned a <em>puppet JID</em> (someusername@legacynetwork.example.com)
that you can use to exchange
messages with them.</p>
<p>Slidge in itself is just a library, and legacy networks clients are actually
slidge&#39;s <strong>plugins</strong>.
Slidge includes plugins for <a href="https://sr.ht/~nicoco/slidge/#slidge-">7 different instant messaging (IM) services</a>.</p>
<p>After discovering IM with mIRC, ICQ and then MSN messenger in the late 90s/early 2000s,
I was amazed when I discovered <a href="https://pidgin.im/">pigdin</a> and was a 
happy user for many years (oh psychic mode,
how you made me look a like a magician to non-techies).
But a few years ago, when I finally jumped into the smartphone bandwagon, it was
a bit frustrating not to have the same &#34;single chat app&#34; experience across multiple devices.</p>
<p><strong>XMPP gateways</strong> are a nice way to achieve this, but except for the excellent <a href="https://biboumi.louiz.org/">biboumi</a>
IRC gateway, I have always been frustrated by the shortcomings of the available implementations.
<a href="https://spectrum.im/">Spectrum2</a> is the leading project in this area, but has been in maintenance
mode for a while and does not plan to integrate new cool features of the now experimental XEPs,
such as <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0444.html">message reactions</a> which I hope many
more XMPP clients will implement in the future (only <a href="https://movim.eu/">Movim</a> implements it AFAIK; it&#39;s great BTW).</p>
<p>Yes it does, with the limitation of not providing any group-related feature: <strong>only direct messages are supported</strong>.
If everything goes according to the plan, groups will be part of the 0.2.0 release, some day™.</p>
<p>I use it daily, and it works just fine for me (which was and still is slidge&#39;s main goal).
It has not been extensively battle-tested, and I would be happy to have feedback of any kind, including
bug reports and/or criticism of the implementation/technical choice/code style/whatever.
Sucking less at writing code is a big reason for me to work on this project.</p>
<p>Slidge is written in async python, using the sleek <a href="https://slixmpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">slixmpp</a> library.
It attempts to make good use of <a href="https://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> for static type checking, and includes (too few) tests
using the <a href="https://docs.pytest.org">pytest</a> framework.</p>
<p>The general idea is to make it <a href="https://slidge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/tutorial.html">trivial</a> to
write plugins through the <a href="https://slidge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/plugin.html">plugin API</a>,
abstracting away the XMPPalities and exposing simple methods.
Hopefully, thanks to the rich python ecosystem, plugins should be a <strong>thin layer</strong>
between the plugin API and some external library handling the legacy network specifics.</p>
<p>Slidge is a server software, and screenshots of log outputs might not be very interesting to look at.
Instead, here are side-by-side screenshots of the XMPP client Movim (left) and the official signal desktop app (right)
side by side.</p>
<p><img src="https://nicoco.fr/blog/2022/09/04/slidge-first-beta/movim.png" alt="Left: Movim; right: signal desktop app"/></p>
<p>Neat, ain&#39;t it?</p>
<p>(Since XMPP is an open standard, Slidge will also work with <strong>any XMPP client</strong>, and I don&#39;t think there is a single
OS that does not have at least one XMPP client.)</p>
<p>Right now, the recommended way to try it out is to go the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/nicocool84">container route</a>;
this is what I use with my personal XMPP server.
A <a href="https://pypi.org/project/slidge/">pypi</a> package is also available if you prefer.</p>
<p>Cloning the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~nicoco/slidge">git repo</a> and trying it locally is also a <strong>very easy</strong> option to
test slidge using <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~nicoco/slidge/tree/master/item/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose</a>,
which spins up a local XMPP server and a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~nicoco/slidge/tree/master/item/docker-compose.yml#L166">browser-based XMPP client</a>.</p>
<p>A nice thing about cloning the repo is that it makes you about halfway to writing the patch fixing
the bug that annoys you or implementing some amazing new feature. ;)</p>
