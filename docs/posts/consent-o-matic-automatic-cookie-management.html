			<h3>Extension</h3>
			<p>The Consent-O-Matic extension does not process any personal data. The only data that Consent-O-Matic stores (on your computer) are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your settings</li>
				<li>A count of pop-ups interacted with</li>
				<li>A count of clicks saved</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			To delete all this data, simply uninstall the browser extension. To delete the counts of pop-ups and clicks without uninstalling, go to the <i>About</i> page in the extension settings and click the <i>Clear</i> button.
			</p>
			<p>
			When you install Consent-O-Matic, you will see a pop-up from your browser that says it can &#34;access your data for all websites&#34; (or something similar depending on which browser you use). You get this warning because Consent-O-Matic needs access to the code of the website you&#39;re visiting to detect if there are any consent pop-ups and interact with them. We do not collect any data about the website you&#39;re visiting or what you do on the website: this warning is about what the extension has permission to do from the browser, not what it actually does.</p>
			<p>
			The only time we will know which website you visit is when you report to us that the extension is not working on a particular page by clicking on the <i>Let us know!</i> button in the settings. In that case we receive a message on our server with the URL, which we store and look at to improve our coverage. The list of URLs might also be shared with other developers in the open-source community to further improve the extension. As part of how the web works, we will also receive your IP address when you send this URL, but we do not access or store this data. We process the IP on the basis of legitimate interest (i.e., we can&#39;t not receive it when you report a website).</p>

			
			<h3>Website</h3>
			<p>When visiting the Consent-O-Matic website, your web browser automatically sends the following information to our web server:</p>	
			<ul>
				<li>the time of the visit</li>
				<li>the IP address of the computer the request comes from</li>
				<li>the referrer website (if you are linked to this page from somewhere else)
				</li><li>inferred geographical information about where the request is made from</li>
				<li>the browser used to visit the website</li>
				<li>the operating system of the computer used to visit the website (if possible)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We process this data based on legitimate interest to be able to evaluate system security, stability, and performance. We store this data for up to 90 days, after which it is deleted automatically. This data is not shared with any third parties.</p>
			<p>Since this is personal data, you have the right to access, erasure, rectification, and portability. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please <a href="#contact">contact us</a> with (a list of) your IP address(es).</p>
