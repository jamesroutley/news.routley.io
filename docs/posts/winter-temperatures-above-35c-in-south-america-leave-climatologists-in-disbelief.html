data-component="Heading">&#39;Flabbergasted&#39; by temperatures</h2><p>University of New South Wales climate scientist Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick said that, even as a climate scientist who specialised in heat extremes, the temperature observations were hard to believe.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m flabbergasted by these temperatures,&#34; Dr Perkins-Kirkpatrick said.</p><p>She said if those temperatures were to occur in New South Wales, which sits at a similar latitude, it would be &#34;extraordinary&#34;.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s reported that Buenos Aires has had the hottest start to August on record and has shattered its previous record by over 5 degrees. That margin is phenomenal,&#34; Dr Perkins-Kirkpatrick said.</p><p>&#34;This is happening during the austral winter.<em> </em>To put it into context, it&#39;s like Sydney experiencing a 30-degree day this time of year — something that is beyond extraordinary.&#34; </p><p>Several other climate scientists have also expressed their disbelief at the temperatures, including Andrew Watkins, a climatologist from Australia&#39;s Bureau of Meteorology, who wrote on social media that the figures were &#34;mind-boggling&#34;.</p><p>Pascal Boureau, a former forecaster at Météo-France, wrote that it was &#34;unheard of&#34;.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Extreme heat in Northern

the July temperatures in 200 countries were made at least three times more likely with climate change.</p><p>This impacted more than 6.5 billion people, or 81 per cent of the global population, according to the analysis.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">What&#39;s causing South America&#39;s heat?</h2><p>Dr Perkins-Kirkpatrick said the South American heat extremes were also likely to<strong> </strong>bear<strong> </strong>the fingerprints of climate change.</p><p>&#34;There are likely multiple causes to these temperatures — record warm sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic, the developing El Niño in the Pacific, a heat dome that was recently over the region combined with foehn winds, and anthropogenic climate change,&#34; she said.</p><p>&#34;Indeed, climate change is probably giving the event a double-whammy, through heating the atmosphere and the ocean.&#34;</p><p>Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descend down the slopes of mountains and ranges.</p><p>Dr Perkins-Kirkpatrick said the temperatures were &#34;equally&#34; as concerning as the heat extremes being experienced in the Northern Hemisphere.</p><p>&#34;While they are not as hot in absolute terms as the Northern Hemisphere, they are totally off the charts so early in August. It&#39;s bonkers,&#34; she said.</p><p>In a social media post, MetSul Meteorologica noted Buenos Aires had experienced temperatures of up to 34C in August before, due to &#34;low-level jets with very warm air&#34;, which occasionally brought summer-like temperatures.</p><p><span data-component="Loading" data-print="inline-media"><span></span><span role="alert" aria-live="assertive">Loading...</span></span></p><p>Data from Chile&#39;s national meteorological service shows the temperatures above 30C have now eased across Chile, with Argentina reporting an easing of conditions across southern parts of the country too, including the capital, Buenos Aires.</p><p>But for central and north Argentina and Brazil, the warmer temperatures are likely to persist for several more days, according to medium-range forecasts from ECMWF.</p></div></div><p><span data-component="Text">Posted<!-- --> </span><time data-component="Timestamp" aria-hidden="true" datetime="2023-08-03T20:24:30.000Z">19h ago</time><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2023-08-03T20:24:30.000Z">19 hours ago</time><time data-component="Text">Thu 3 Aug 2023 at 8:24pm</time>, <span data-component="Text">updated<!-- --> </span><time data-component="Timestamp" aria-hidden="true" datetime="2023-08-04T05:59:32.000Z">10h ago</time><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2023-08-04T05:59:32.000Z">10 hours ago</time><time data-component="Text">Fri 4 Aug 2023 at 5:59am</time></p></div>
