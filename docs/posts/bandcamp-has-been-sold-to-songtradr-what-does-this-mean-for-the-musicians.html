    <h1>Bandcamp has been sold to Songtradr. What does this mean for the musicians?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Epic Games, the maker of hits such as Fortnite, just <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/layoffs-at-epic">laid off 16% of staff</a>, or 830 people — and it’s <a href="https://www.songtradr.com/blog/posts/songtradr-bandcamp-acquisition">sold Bandcamp to Songtradr</a>, a music licensing company.</p>
<p>Epic is privately-held, so it doesn’t have Wall Street analysts to answer to — but it went on a spending spree through 2021 and 2022, and the numbers evidently weren’t adding up. Bandcamp is still profitable, but that makes it just a particuarly saleable non-core business. Also dumped was SuperAwesome, a “youth marketing solutions” company, in an upper management buyout.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bandcampunited.org/">Bandcamp unionised</a> in March 2023. Game development companies are allergic to unions, so that probably made Bandcamp a fair bit less attractive. Epic even <a href="https://boingboing.net/2023/04/10/bandcamp-reportedly-union-busting-by-pressuring-record-labels.html">tried to get record labels to pressure the Bandcamp United union</a> to stop their efforts.</p>
<p>Epic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Apple">lost most of an expensive lawsuit against Apple</a> in 2021, and both sides are appealing to the US Supreme Court at further expense.</p>
<p>Epic only <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/bandcamp-joining-epic-games-to-support-fair-open-platforms-for-artists-and-fans">bought Bandcamp eighteen months ago</a>. Nobody could work out quite what Epic could do with Bandcamp. That seems to include Epic. It didn’t have synergy with game development or distribution.</p>
<p>Bandcamp is good, it’s profitable and sustainable and it basically works. <a href="https://rocknerd.co.uk/2016/08/29/is-bandcamp-the-holy-grail-of-online-record-stores-hell-yes/">Musicians love Bandcamp</a> and depend on it. They worried at the Epic sale and now they wonder what the Songtradr sale means.</p>
<p>Plus point: at least Songtradr is in the same business. Minus point: at least Epic wasn’t in the same business, and didn’t mess with Bandcamp, despite many musicians’ fears when they bought it.</p>
<p>Songtradr is talking up using its licensing prowess to give opportunities to Bandcamp artists — including licensing on Epic games.</p>
<p>Songtradr can’t just grab your Bandcamp uploads. Sync licensing (TV or movies) is very lucrative and hence legally complex. You need to licence both the composition and the desired recording of it.</p>
<p>Games are one of the places composers can get work these days. Game music and classical are the same genre, right? If Songtradr can hook up composers with Epic or other companies, there are <i>plenty</i> of composers who will be extremely interested.</p>
<p>Thinking of <a href="https://rocknerd.co.uk/2021/11/01/arkady-rose-nocturne-2021/">the loved one,</a> with her <a href="https://arkadyrose.bandcamp.com/">six albums of light classical</a>. Buy a CD, we got a box of ’em here! Goes great with your game!</p>
