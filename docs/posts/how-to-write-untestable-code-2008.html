    <h1>How to write untestable code (2008)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I want to throw $.02 in support of what Igor is saying.  I also agree with much of the points made in this post, but I will concede that after learning how to effectively apply a framework like EasyMock, many of these issues go away, b/c the code is testable using the framework.  This isn&#39;t to promote crap code, but some of the things you end up doing in your design &#34;just to make the code testable&#34; can go away with a proper mock framework.  EasyMock is *not* hard to learn, either, by the way.</p><p><span><a target="_self" data-comment-id="1299919145011479139">Reply</a><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=15045980&amp;postID=1299919145011479139">Delete</a></span></span></p></div></div>
