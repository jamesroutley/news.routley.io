I’m trying an experiment: <a href="https://calendly.com/veit-veitheller">open coffee chats</a> with one slot per weekday at 9am Midwestern time (16:00 CEST). Whether you’re wrestling with DD prep, developer UX, a compiler issue, NetBox-driven automation, or how to implement lived security practices in your org, grab a slot. No sales, just ideas and chats, as if we are friends (and maybe we are?!). If we see a business fit, we’ll set a separate call, but that’s not why I’m doing this. In fact, if you have business propositions or pitches or need a professional consultation, reach out via e-mail or LinkedIn instead.
  </p>
<p>
Rather, it’s an extensions of the <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/open_invite.html">Open Invitation</a> I implemented years ago. I love hearing from people, and a handful of people have written to me over the years; I’ve even met up with a few! But through the pandemic and the joys of fatherhood, the times at which I can hang out at a coffee shop come at a premium.
  </p>
<p>
And so I thought—begrudgingly, to be sure—that moving things to the virtual realm might be the best course of action.
  </p>
<p>
So, if you’re curious, <a href="https://calendly.com/veit-veitheller">book a slot</a> and we can chat! I’d love to hear from all of you.
