    <h1>How Likely Is Losing a Google Account?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <p><span>

Let&#39;s say you use a Google account as the root of your online
identity: Gmail, Fi, &#34;Sign in with Google&#34;, Google&#39;s password manager,
etc.  How much should you be worried that you&#39;ll suddenly find
yourself unable to get into everything?  Should you do something else
instead?

</span></p><p>

To get a sense of how common lockouts are and how they happen I looked
through lockout reports on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> by searching for
<a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?q=Google+blocked+account">[google
blocked account]</a> and <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=Google%20%22locked%22%20out&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story">[google
locked out]</a>.  I looked at top-level stories and the comments on
them for cases where people were entirely locked out of an account; I
didn&#39;t include cases where people lost access to only some Google
services (Payments, AdWords, etc) or where they did get back in on
their own.  I did count cases where it took making a lot of noise on
HN or Twitter, though.

</p>
<p>

There are two reasons people seem to get locked out:

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Security lockouts: they&#39;re not convinced you&#39;re you, and are
trying to prevent an attacker from getting into your account.

</p></li>
<li><p>Policy lockouts: they don&#39;t like you.  They&#39;ve flagged your
account as abusive, enough that they completely suspend your account.

</p></li>
</ul>

<p>

I found 32 cases (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BGNnbN4sbrhm-2nR-uIF1_dRcjHb2nQsaQZwhKgJg8c/edit?usp=sharing">sheet</a>),
going back to 2008.  I found 22 security lockouts, 7 policy lockouts,
and 3 with too few details to tell.  I think this likely majorly
undercounts security lockouts relative to policy ones: reading the
comments, a lot of the security ones were like &#34;<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31075145">that happened to
me too</a>&#34; while the policy ones got <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html">mainstream
news</a>
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-users-locked-out-after-years-2020-10">articles</a>. [1]

</p>
<p>

With the security lockouts, in cases where you could tell what had
happened the most common reason was that someone had configured a
backup method (phone number, recovery email, 2FA) but no longer had
access.  The second most common were cases where someone hadn&#39;t
configured any backup methods and Google was considering their login
to be suspicious.

</p>
<p>

Security lockouts are a tricky situation because failures in either
direction are very bad.  All of the above are false positives: people
who should have been let back into their accounts but weren&#39;t.  But
there are also false negatives: cases where an attacker was let into
someone&#39;s account.

</p>
<p>

There is a question of whether Google should be flagging suspicious
logins at all, though.  If my account were protected only by a
password and someone else got it, maybe Google should just let them
in?  The problem is that this would mean lots of hacked accounts: it&#39;s
common for passwords to get revealed through phishing or cross-site
password reuse.  Using other aspects of your login, like your country,
device, activity pattern, etc. as a kind of pseudo-2FA probably does
make things better for users overall: if my username and password
suddenly appeared from a new device in Russia there really is a good
chance that it&#39;s someone trying to hack me.  Luckily, users have a
better option: opting into tighter security by setting up good 2FA.
The more ways you can demonstrate that you are actually you, the lower
the risk both of hacks and lockouts.

</p>
<p>

After going through these, it seems to me that the likelihood of a
security lockout is low enough not to worry about if you:

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>In addition to memorizing your password, write it down and
store it in a safe place.  This is also worth doing if there&#39;s someone
you want to have access to the account immediately if something
happens to you (the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/inactive">Inactive Account
Manager</a> is also good, but it reasonably has a substantial delay).

</p></li>
<li><p>Configure backup methods (phone, email).

</p></li>
<li><p>Update backup methods promptly when they change.  You
can see what you have configured at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security">myaccount.google.com/security</a>.

</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally, <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/not-getting-hacked">set up security
keys</a> for two-factor authentication, and if you do set up three
(work, home, keychain or <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/9289445">phone</a>).

</p></li>
</ul>

<p>

What about the policy lockouts, though?  I think the risk there is
also very low: these are rare enough to be newsworthy when they
happen, even if they don&#39;t happen to anyone previously well-known. I
put a little effort into avoiding grey areas (not filing chargebacks
to Google, not taking pictures of my kids in the bath) but otherwise
don&#39;t worry about this.

</p>
<p>

Even if the risk is low, however, maybe it would still be better to
switch to something else that is even lower risk?  The problem is that
security and policy lockouts are something you can find with any
service.  For example, in HN discussions people will <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15996506">often</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34116550">recommend</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32863594">Fastmail</a> or
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31073536">Protonmail</a>,
but they&#39;ve had their problems too (FM: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15855081">2017</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fastmail/comments/eus5kf/5y_customer_got_banned_without_any_notice/">2020</a>,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fastmail/comments/s1zot3/if_youve_been_locked_out_of_your_fastmail_account/">2022</a>,
PM: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/agnoyc/false_positives_on_account_locking_why_it_will/">2018</a>,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/9o0n9r/protonmail_account_locked_due_to_abuse_or_fraud/">2019</a>,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/itsfsb/im_locked_out_of_my_account_by_accident_no_help/">2021</a>).
Especially given that these are much smaller services I&#39;m not
convinced that the risk is lower there.  Any system is going to have
to handle this sort of problem, and you&#39;re not going to find one that
never has false positives.

</p>
<p>

This is not to say these companies can&#39;t do better here: without the
outrage when they make a bad call I expect they would invest somewhat
less in trying to make good calls.  And if a provider does give a
consistently worse experience than other options migrating makes
sense.  But after looking through the reports above I&#39;m comfortable
with the level of risk involved in keeping my Gmail account as
primary.
