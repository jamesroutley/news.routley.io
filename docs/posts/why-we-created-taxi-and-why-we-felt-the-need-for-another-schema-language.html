    <h1>Why we created Taxi, and why we felt the need for another schema language</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m often asked why we felt the need for another schema language - why not just use <code>OpenAPI | SQL | Protobuf | GraphQL</code>?</p><p>Inevitably, someone links <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/"><strong>that</strong> xkcd</a> cartoon.  Luckily, that cartoon is actually really funny,
so I don’t mind re-reading over and over and over.</p><p>It seems the one standard the internet can agree on is to respond to discussions about schema languages with that cartoon.</p><p>However, it’s a fair question, and one that deserves a good answer.  So, to summarize:</p><ul role="list"><li>Yes, Taxi is another schema language.  It’s different.</li><li>Yes, we felt there need for one more.  It has different goals than the others, and addresses shortcomings we felt existed.</li><li>Yes, there’s now one more way to do things… kinda  (We don’t expect you to migrate from OpenAPI to Taxi.)</li></ul><h2 id="what-is-taxi"><a href="#what-is-taxi" aria-label="Anchor">​</a><span>What is Taxi?</span></h2><p><a href="https://taxilang.org">Taxi</a> is a language for documenting data models and data sources (APIs, Event streams, Databases).</p><p>It’s designed for describing how
data relates <em>across</em> an ecosystem of datasources (such as an enterprise), rather than a single API.</p><p>We do this so we can automate orchestration and interoperability between data sources, without writing glue code.</p><blockquote><p>Where most schema languages describe a single data source (API, Event Stream, Db, Serverless function), Taxi is designed for describing how
data relates <em>across</em> an ecosystem of datasources (such as an enterprise).</p></blockquote><p>Taxi can partially describe:</p><ul role="list"><li>Databases - but you can’t replace DDL with Taxi.</li><li>HTTP APIs - but you’ll probably keep using OpenAPI / gRPC - and that’s cool.</li><li>Message queues, like Kafka and Rabbit - but you can’t replace Protobuf with Taxi.</li></ul><p>For example, here’s a Taxi spec describing a database, a Kafka topic, and a REST API:</p><pre><code><span>service</span> <span></span>FilmsDatabase <span>{</span>

more glue code, and meant we were tightly coupling to that spec - meaning when the spec introduced breaking changes, our
glue code had to be repaired.</p><p>That seemed silly.  Even though we had all these specs that describe what APIs do, it still
fell to engineers to work out which API to call, what data to pass for inputs, and write the glue code.</p><blockquote><p>Even though we had all these specs that describe what APIs do, it still

Over, and over, and over.</p></div></div></div><p>That sucks, because consumers are a-plenty, meaning that the “how does this relate to that” is answered over and over.</p><p>Instead, with Taxi, we shift the obligation of documenting how things relate to producers, by embedding metadata
in their APIs.</p><p>This means work is done once - by the teams who understand the APIs the best - the ones building it.</p><h3 id="what-if-teams-put-the-wrong-metadata"><a href="#what-if-teams-put-the-wrong-metadata" aria-label="Anchor">​</a><span>What if teams put the wrong metadata?</span></h3><p>Yeah, that’s a problem.  If teams map fields together incorrectly, then the wrong APIs are stitched together.</p><p>But, that problem exists today - every time a new consumer stitches together some APIs, they’re performing the Field Mapping Foxtrot, and there’s a chance they’ll get it wrong.</p><p>So, by leaving it to consumers to map fields together, we’re actually facing this risk over and over.</p><p>In practice, the teams who are building the API have a much deeper understanding of how their data relates to the broader ecosystem, as they know their API best.  And, whilst producers
can’t map their APIs to all consumers, they can attach a piece of well-defined metadata that assigns a <a href="https://orbitalhq.com/blog/2023-01-16-using-semantic-metadata">semantic contract we all agree on</a>.</p><p>That being said, I think tooling can help more here than we do currently.

composing multiple APIs together. GraphQL has been a strong inspiration in how we’ve designed
Taxi.</p><p>However, there are key differences in their approach.</p><h3 id="no-global-schema"><a href="#no-global-schema" aria-label="Anchor">​</a><span>No global schema</span></h3><p>GraphQL defines a single global schema that all consumers adhere to.  Consumers can
cherry-pick the fields they want, but the structure is fixed.</p><p>That global schema can create friction to change - if you need to refactor the schema, you either need
to make backwards compatible changes, or consumers need to update.</p><p>Which is to say - evolving a shared structural contract is hard, and <em>someone</em> needs to take the hit - either the schema owner (through maintaining a backwards compatible change),
or the consumers (by fixing what breaks when the schema changes).</p><p>This isn’t just a GraphQL issue - it’s true of any structural contract that is widely shared - they’re hard to change.</p><h3 id="consumer-driven-contracts"><a href="#consumer-driven-contracts" aria-label="Anchor">​</a><span>Consumer driven contracts</span></h3><p>GraphQL has consumer-driven-contracts-lite.  ie., consumers can cherry-pick the fields they want from
the global schema.  However, that’s it - structure, encoding, etc is fixed.</p><p>If you want to consume data in a different shape, you’ll need to map the data on the consumer side.</p><p>Those additional mapping layers are troublesome - each mapping layer you build is a tight coupling between contracts - ie.,
a thing that has to change when the upstream contract changes.</p><p>Instead, with Taxi, consumers define the data contract they want to consume in the request they send.</p><p>There is no single central schema - producer APIs are composed together on-the-fly to satisfy the consumer contract.</p><p>The types and query language provide enough flexibility that consumers can express the exact
contract they require, and the middleware can understand how to assemble a response.</p><h3 id="no-resolvers"><a href="#no-resolvers" aria-label="Anchor">​</a><span>No resolvers</span></h3><p>GraphQL uses resolvers to stitch together APIs - which is exactly the type of integration code
we’re on a mission to eliminate.</p><p>As APIs change, resolvers need to be maintained and updated.</p><p>Generally, with Taxi you don’t need resolvers - the API specs are rich enough to automate the resolvers.</p><h3 id="technology-agnostic"><a href="#technology-agnostic" aria-label="Anchor">​</a><span>Technology-agnostic</span></h3><p>GraphQL requires GraphQL everywhere, or shims to adapt to GraphQL.</p><p>Taxi (and taxiQL) is trying hard to keep the footprint low - Taxi will happily compose together a Kafka topic

In the meantime, you can take it for a spin following our <a href="https://orbitalhq.com/docs/guides/first-integration">getting started guide</a>.</p><h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary" aria-label="Anchor">​</a><span>Summary</span></h2><p>So, here’s the key takeaways:</p><p>Taxi exists to describe how data and data sources relate to one another, and to automate interoperability.</p><p>OpenAPI, SQL, Protobuf, etc., all do a great job of describing a single data source.  By adding additional
metadata into those APIs, we have enough information to automate integration between services, without
writing (or maintaining) glue code.</p><p>TaxiQL is a way to use Taxi types to ask for data, and for consumers  to remain decoupled from producer schemas,
so as things change, there’s no glue code to maintain.</p><p>XKCD is the one true standard, which is how it was always meant to be.</p></div></div>
