    <h1>On the removal of Come Back Alive</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>This morning, Patreon suspended a Ukrainian organization’s page from our site called “Come Back Alive” because it violated our policies. The website of the organization says they use contributions to finance and train military personnel. Specifically, they claim to use funds they received for the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><i><span>“funds were used for… more than 1,500 tablets with software for Gunnya-Armor artillerymen, </span></i><b><i>230 quadcopters,</i></b><i><span> 45 mobile surveillance systems…, and </span></i><b><i>more than 60 military vehicles.”</i></b></li>
<li><span>“</span><i><span>The organization also initiates the creation and implementation of new technical solutions</span></i><span>,” including </span><b>“</b><b><i>models of artillery weapons.</i></b><b>”</b></li>
<li><b><i>“trained 350 snipers</i></b><i><span>, more than 2,000 sappers and more than </span></i><b><i>3,000 gunners,</i></b><i><span> and training is being conducted to train UAV operators.”</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We don’t allow Patreon to be used for funding weapons or military activity. It is a </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/policy/guidelines"><span>violation of our policies</span></a><span>, and so we have removed the page. All remaining funds in the account will be refunded to contributors. </span></p>
<p><span>For those still looking to help, Ukrainian journalists have recommended several charities and platforms that would benefit from donations, such as the </span><a href="https://redcross.org.ua/en/"><span>Ukrainian Red Cross Society</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://voices.org.ua/en/"><span>Voices of Children</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.rsukraine.org/"><span>Revived Soldiers Ukraine</span></a><span>. There are also 3,000+ Ukrainian creators on Patreon – and thousands more using other platforms – who would benefit from our support. </span></p>
<p><span>We are shocked and heartbroken at the invasion of Ukraine. Like so many around the world, we are watching this tragedy closely and wishing for the safety of the Ukrainian people in harm’s way. </span></p>
