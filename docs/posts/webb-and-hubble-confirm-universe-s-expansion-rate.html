				<p>The rate at which the Universe is expanding, known as the Hubble constant, is one of the fundamental parameters for understanding the evolution and ultimate fate of the cosmos. However, a persistent difference, called the Hubble Tension, is seen between the value of the constant measured with a wide range of independent distance indicators and its value predicted from the afterglow of the Big Bang. The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that the Hubble Space Telescope’s keen eye was right all along, erasing any lingering doubt about Hubble’s measurements.</p><p>This image of NGC 5468, a galaxy located about 130 million light-years from Earth, combines data from the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Hubble_overview" target="_blank">Hubble</a> and <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb" target="_blank">James Webb space</a> telescopes. This is the most distant galaxy in which Hubble has identified Cepheid variable stars. These stars are important milepost markers for measuring the expansion rate of the Universe. The distance calculated from Cepheids has been cross-correlated with a Type Ia supernova in the galaxy. Type Ia supernovae are so bright they are used to measure cosmic distances far beyond the range of the Cepheids, extending measurements of the Universe’s expansion rate deeper into space.</p><p><a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb/Webb_Hubble_confirm_Universe_s_expansion_rate" target="_blank">Read more</a></p><p>[<i>Image description</i>: A face-on spiral galaxy with four spiral arms that curve outward in a counterclockwise direction. The spiral arms are filled with young, blue stars and peppered with purplish star-forming regions that appear as small blobs. The middle of the galaxy is much brighter and more yellowish, and has a distinct narrow linear bar angled from 11 o’clock to 5 o’clock. Dozens of red background galaxies are scattered across the image. The background of space is black.]</p>
