<h3>
<a name="OperationCounting">
About the operation counting methodology
</a>
</h3>

When totaling the number of operations for algorithms here, 
any C operator is counted as one operation.   
Intermediate assignments, which need not be written to RAM, are
not counted.
Of course, this operation counting approach only serves as an 
approximation of the actual number of machine instructions and CPU time.
All operations are assumed to take the same amount of time, which
is not true in reality, but CPUs have been heading increasingly in this 
direction over time.  There are many nuances that determine
how fast a system will run a given sample of code, such as cache sizes, 
memory bandwidths, instruction sets, etc.  In the end, benchmarking is 
the best way to determine whether one method is really faster than another, 
so consider the techniques below as possibilities to test on your target 
architecture.

<hr/>

<h3>
<a name="CopyIntegerSign">
Compute the sign of an integer
</a>
</h3>

<pre>int v;      // we want to find the sign of v
int sign;   // the result goes here 

// CHAR_BIT is the number of bits per byte (normally 8).
sign = -(v &lt; 0);  // if v &lt; 0 then -1, else 0. 
// or, to avoid branching on CPUs with flag registers (IA32):
sign = -(int)((unsigned int)((int)v) &gt;&gt; (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1));
// or, for one less instruction (but not portable):
sign = v &gt;&gt; (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1); 
</pre>

The last expression above evaluates to sign = v &gt;&gt; 31 
for 32-bit integers.  
This is one operation faster than the obvious way, sign = -(v &lt; 0).
This trick works because when signed integers are shifted right, the value 
of the far left bit is copied to the other bits.  The far left bit is 1 
when the value is negative and 0 otherwise; all 1 bits gives -1.  
Unfortunately, this behavior is architecture-specific.
<p>
Alternatively, if you prefer the result be either -1 or +1, then use:
</p><pre>sign = +1 | (v &gt;&gt; (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1));  // if v &lt; 0 then -1, else +1
</pre>
<p>
On the other hand, if you prefer the result be either -1, 0, or +1, then use:
</p><pre>sign = (v != 0) | -(int)((unsigned int)((int)v) &gt;&gt; (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1));
// Or, for more speed but less portability:
sign = (v != 0) | (v &gt;&gt; (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1));  // -1, 0, or +1
// Or, for portability, brevity, and (perhaps) speed:
sign = (v &gt; 0) - (v &lt; 0); // -1, 0, or +1
</pre>
If instead you want to know if something is non-negative, resulting in +1 or
else 0, then use:
<pre>sign = 1 ^ ((unsigned int)v &gt;&gt; (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1)); // if v &lt; 0 then 0, else 1
</pre>

Caveat:  On March 7, 2003, Angus Duggan pointed out that the 1989 ANSI C 
specification leaves the result of signed right-shift implementation-defined,
so on some systems this hack might not work.  For greater portability, 
Toby Speight suggested on September 28, 2005 that CHAR_BIT be used here 
and throughout rather than assuming bytes were 8 bits long.  Angus recommended
the more portable versions above, involving casting on March 4, 2006.
<a href="http://rpg-314.blogspot.com/">Rohit Garg</a> suggested the version 
for non-negative integers on September 12, 2009.

<h3>
<a name="DetectOppositeSigns">Detect if two integers have opposite signs
</a>
</h3>

<pre>int x, y;               // input values to compare signs

bool f = ((x ^ y) &lt; 0); // true iff x and y have opposite signs
</pre>

Manfred Weis suggested I add this entry on November 26, 2009.
<hr/>

<h3>
<a name="IntegerAbs">
Compute the integer absolute value (abs) without branching
</a>
</h3>

<pre>int v;           // we want to find the absolute value of v
unsigned int r;  // the result goes here 
int const mask = v &gt;&gt; sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1;

r = (v + mask) ^ mask;
</pre>
Patented variation:
<pre>r = (v ^ mask) - mask;
</pre>

Some CPUs don&#39;t have an integer absolute value instruction (or the
compiler fails to use them).  On machines where branching is expensive,
the above expression can be faster than the obvious approach, 
r = (v &lt; 0) ? -(unsigned)v : v, even though the number of operations 
is the same.
<p>
On March 7, 2003, Angus Duggan pointed out that the 1989 ANSI C 
specification leaves the result of signed right-shift implementation-defined,
so on some systems this hack might not work.  I&#39;ve read that ANSI C does not
require values to be represented as two&#39;s complement, so it may not work 
for that reason as well (on a diminishingly small number of old machines 
that still use one&#39;s complement).

On March 14, 2004, Keith H. Duggar sent me the patented variation above; it is 
superior to the one I initially came up with, 
<code>r=(+1|(v&gt;&gt;(sizeof(int)*CHAR_BIT-1)))*v</code>, 
because a multiply is not used.  
Unfortunately, this method has been <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/search-adv.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=ptxt&amp;S1=6073150&amp;OS=6073150&amp;RS=6073150">
patented</a> in the USA on June 6, 2000 by Vladimir Yu Volkonsky and 
assigned to <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>. 

On August 13, 2006, Yuriy 
Kaminskiy told me that the patent is likely invalid because the method
was published well before the patent was even filed, such as in 
<a href="http://www.goof.com/pcg/doc/pentopt.txt">How to Optimize for
the Pentium Processor</a> by Agner Fog, dated November, 9, 1996.  Yuriy also 
mentioned that this document was translated to Russian in 1997, which 
Vladimir could have read.  Moreover, the Internet Archive also has an old 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961201174141/www.x86.org/ftp/articles/pentopt/PENTOPT.TXT">link</a> to it. 

On January 30, 2007, Peter Kankowski shared with me an 
<a href="http://smallcode.weblogs.us/2007/01/31/microsoft-probably-uses-the-abs-function-patented-by-sun/">abs version</a> 
he discovered that was inspired by Microsoft&#39;s Visual C++ compiler output.  
It is featured here as the primary solution.

On December 6, 2007, Hai Jin complained that the result was signed, so when
computing the abs of the most negative value, it was still negative.

On April 15, 2008 Andrew Shapira pointed out that the obvious approach
could overflow, as it lacked an (unsigned) cast then; 
for maximum portability he suggested
<code>(v &lt; 0) ? (1 + ((unsigned)(-1-v))) : (unsigned)v</code>.  

But citing the ISO C99 spec on July 9, 2008, 
Vincent Lefèvre convinced me
to remove it becasue even on non-2s-complement machines -(unsigned)v 
will do the right thing.  The evaluation of -(unsigned)v first converts
the negative value of v to an unsigned by adding 2**N, 
yielding a 2s complement representation of v&#39;s value that I&#39;ll call U.  
Then, U is negated, giving the desired result, 
-U = 0 - U = 2**N - U = 2**N - (v+2**N) = -v = abs(v).
</p><hr/>

<h3>
<a name="IntegerMinOrMax">
Compute the minimum (min) or maximum (max) of two integers without branching
</a>
</h3>

<pre>int x;  // we want to find the minimum of x and y
int y;   
int r;  // the result goes here 

r = y ^ ((x ^ y) &amp; -(x &lt; y)); // min(x, y)
</pre>

On some rare machines where branching is very expensive and no condition
move instructions exist, the above expression
might be faster than the obvious approach, r = (x &lt; y) ? x : y, even 
though it involves two more instructions.  
(Typically, the obvious approach is best, though.)
It works because if x &lt; y, 
then -(x &lt; y) will be all ones, 
so r = y ^ (x ^ y) &amp; ~0 = y ^ x ^ y = x.  
Otherwise, if x &gt;= y, 
then -(x &lt; y) will be all zeros, 
so r = y ^ ((x ^ y) &amp; 0) = y.  
On some machines, evaluating (x &lt; y) as 0 
or 1 requires a branch instruction, so there may be no
advantage.  
<p>
To find the maximum, use:
</p><pre>r = x ^ ((x ^ y) &amp; -(x &lt; y)); // max(x, y)
</pre>

<h4>Quick and dirty versions:</h4>

If you know that INT_MIN &lt;= x - y &lt;= INT_MAX,
then you can use the following, which 
are faster because (x - y) only needs to be evaluated once.  
<pre>r = y + ((x - y) &amp; ((x - y) &gt;&gt; (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1))); // min(x, y)
r = x - ((x - y) &amp; ((x - y) &gt;&gt; (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1))); // max(x, y)
</pre>
Note that the 1989 ANSI C specification doesn&#39;t specify the result of 
signed right-shift, so these aren&#39;t portable.
If exceptions are thrown on overflows, then the values of x
and y should be unsigned or cast to unsigned for the subtractions
to avoid unnecessarily throwing an exception, however the right-shift
needs a signed operand to produce all one bits when negative, so cast 
to signed there.
<p>

On March 7, 2003, Angus Duggan pointed out the right-shift portability issue.
On May 3, 2005, Randal E. Bryant alerted me to the need for the 
precondition, INT_MIN &lt;= x - y &lt;= INT_MAX, 
and suggested the non-quick and dirty version as a fix.  
Both of these issues concern only the quick and dirty version.  
Nigel Horspoon observed on July 6, 2005 that gcc produced the 
same code on a Pentium as the obvious solution because of how it
evaluates (x &lt; y).  On July 9, 2008 Vincent Lefèvre pointed out
the potential for overflow exceptions with subtractions in 
r = y + ((x - y) &amp; -(x &lt; y)), which was the previous version.
Timothy B. Terriberry suggested using xor rather than add and subract
to avoid casting and the risk of overflows on June 2, 2009.

Note that 0 is incorrectly considered a power of 2 here.  To remedy

<h3>
<a name="FixedSignExtend">
Sign extending from a constant bit-width
</a>
</h3>

Sign extension is automatic for built-in types, such as chars and ints.
But suppose you have a signed two&#39;s complement number, x, that is stored 
using only b bits.  Moreover, suppose you want to convert x to an int,
which has more than b bits.  A simple copy will work if x
is positive, but if negative, the sign must be extended.  For example,
if we have only 4 bits to store a number, then -3 is represented as 1101 
in binary.  If we have 8 bits, then -3 is 11111101.  The most-significant
bit of the 4-bit representation is replicated sinistrally to fill
in the destination when we convert to a representation with more bits; 
this is sign extending.  
In C, sign extension from a constant bit-width is trivial, since bit 
fields may be specified in structs or unions.  
For example, to convert from 5 bits to an full integer:

<pre>int x; // convert this from using 5 bits to a full int
int r; // resulting sign extended number goes here
struct {signed int x:5;} s;
r = s.x = x;
</pre>

The following is a C++ template function that uses the same 
language feature to convert from B bits in one operation (though 
the compiler is generating more, of course).

<pre>template &lt;typename T, unsigned B&gt;
inline T signextend(const T x)
{
  struct {T x:B;} s;
  return s.x = x;
}

int r = signextend&lt;signed int,5&gt;(x);  // sign extend 5 bit number x to r
</pre>
<p>
John Byrd caught a typo in the code (attributed to html formatting)
on May 2, 2005.  On March 4, 2006, Pat Wood pointed out that the ANSI C 
standard requires that the bitfield have the keyword &#34;signed&#34; to be signed; 
otherwise, the sign is undefined.
</p><hr/>

<h3>
<a name="VariableSignExtend">
Sign extending from a variable bit-width
</a>
</h3>

Sometimes we need to extend the sign of a number but we don&#39;t know a priori
the number of bits, b, in which it is represented.  (Or we could be
programming in a language like Java, which lacks bitfields.)  

<pre>unsigned b; // number of bits representing the number in x
int x;      // sign extend this b-bit number to r
int r;      // resulting sign-extended number
int const m = 1U &lt;&lt; (b - 1); // mask can be pre-computed if b is fixed

x = x &amp; ((1U &lt;&lt; b) - 1);  // (Skip this if bits in x above position b are already zero.)
r = (x ^ m) - m;
</pre>

The code above requires four operations, but when the bitwidth is a 
constant rather than variable, it requires only two fast operations,
assuming the upper bits are already zeroes.
<p>
A slightly faster but less portable method that doesn&#39;t depend on 
the bits in x above position b being zero is:
</p><pre>int const m = CHAR_BIT * sizeof(x) - b;
r = (x &lt;&lt; m) &gt;&gt; m;
</pre>

<p>
Sean A. Irvine suggested that I
add sign extension methods to this page on June 13, 2004, and he provided
<code>m = (1 &lt;&lt; (b - 1)) - 1; r = -(x &amp; ~m) | x;</code>
as a starting point from which I optimized to get 
m = 1U &lt;&lt; (b - 1); r = -(x &amp; m) | x.  
But then on May 11, 2007, Shay Green suggested the version above, 
which requires one less operation than mine.  Vipin Sharma suggested
I add a step to deal with situations where x had possible ones in bits 
other than the b bits we wanted to sign-extend on Oct. 15, 2008.
On December 31, 2009 Chris Pirazzi suggested I add the faster version, 
which requires two operations for constant bit-widths and three 
for variable widths.
</p><hr/>

<h3>
<a name="VariableSignExtendRisky">
Sign extending from a variable bit-width in 3 operations
</a>
</h3>

The following may be slow on some machines, due to the effort required for
multiplication and division.  This version is 4 operations.  If you
know that your initial bit-width, b, is greater than 1, you might do this
type of sign extension in 3 operations by using 
r = (x * multipliers[b]) / multipliers[b],
which requires only one array lookup.

<pre>unsigned b; // number of bits representing the number in x
int x;      // sign extend this b-bit number to r
int r;      // resulting sign-extended number
#define M(B) (1U &lt;&lt; ((sizeof(x) * CHAR_BIT) - B)) // CHAR_BIT=bits/byte
static int const multipliers[] = 
{
  0,     M(1),  M(2),  M(3),  M(4),  M(5),  M(6),  M(7),

  M(16), M(17), M(18), M(19), M(20), M(21), M(22), M(23),
  M(24), M(25), M(26), M(27), M(28), M(29), M(30), M(31),

On some architectures, the lack of branching can more than make up for
what appears to be twice as many operations.  For instance, informal 
speed tests on an AMD Athlon™ XP 2100+ indicated it was 5-10% 
faster.  An Intel Core 2 Duo ran the superscalar version about 16% 
faster than the first.
Glenn Slayden informed me of the first expression on

<h3>
<a name="ConditionalNegate">Conditionally negate a value without branching</a>

If you need to negate only when a flag is false, then use the following 
to avoid branching:

<pre>bool fDontNegate;  // Flag indicating we should not negate v.
int v;             // Input value to negate if fDontNegate is false.
int r;             // result = fDontNegate ? v : -v;

r = (fDontNegate ^ (fDontNegate - 1)) * v;
</pre>

If you need to negate only when a flag is true, then use this:
<pre>bool fNegate;  // Flag indicating if we should negate v.
int v;         // Input value to negate if fNegate is true.
int r;         // result = fNegate ? -v : v;

r = (v ^ -fNegate) + fNegate;
</pre>


Avraham Plotnitzky suggested I add the first version on June 2, 2009.  
Motivated to avoid the multiply, I came up with the second version on
June 8, 2009.  Alfonso De Gregorio pointed out that some parens were

r = a ^ ((a ^ b) &amp; mask); 
</pre>

This shaves one operation from the obvious way of combining two sets of bits
according to a bit mask.  If the mask is a constant, then there may be no
advantage.

This method requires a 64-bit CPU with fast modulus division to be efficient.

The B array, expressed as binary, is:

We can adjust the method for larger integer sizes by continuing with 
the patterns for the <em>Binary Magic Numbers,</em> B and S.  

If there are k bits, then we need the arrays S and B to be ceil(lg(k)) 
elements long, and we must compute the same number of expressions for c as
S or B are long.  For a 32-bit v, 16 operations are used.
<p>
The best method for counting bits in a 32-bit integer v is the following:
</p><pre>v = v - ((v &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; 0x55555555);                    // reuse input as temporary
v = (v &amp; 0x33333333) + ((v &gt;&gt; 2) &amp; 0x33333333);     // temp
c = ((v + (v &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 0xF0F0F0F) * 0x1010101) &gt;&gt; 24; // count
</pre>
<p>
The best bit counting method takes only 12 operations, 
which is the same as the lookup-table method, 
but avoids the memory and potential cache misses of a table.  
It is a hybrid between the purely parallel method above
and the earlier methods using multiplies (in the section on counting bits 
with 64-bit instructions), though it doesn&#39;t use 64-bit instructions.
The counts of bits set in the bytes is done in parallel, and the sum 
total of the bits set in the bytes is computed by multiplying by 0x1010101
and shifting right 24 bits.
</p><p>
A generalization of the best bit counting method to integers 
of bit-widths upto 128 (parameterized by type T) is this:
</p><pre>v = v - ((v &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; (T)~(T)0/3);                           // temp
v = (v &amp; (T)~(T)0/15*3) + ((v &gt;&gt; 2) &amp; (T)~(T)0/15*3);      // temp
v = (v + (v &gt;&gt; 4)) &amp; (T)~(T)0/255*15;                      // temp
c = (T)(v * ((T)~(T)0/255)) &gt;&gt; (sizeof(T) - 1) * CHAR_BIT; // count

nibble of v.  This number is like a miniature 16-bit parity-table indexed by 
the low four bits in v.  The result has the parity of v in bit 1, which is 
masked and returned.
<p>
Thanks to Mathew Hendry for pointing out the shift-lookup idea at the end on
Dec. 15, 2002.  
That optimization shaves two operations off using only shifting and XORing
to find the parity.

This swaps the values of a and b <em>without using a temporary variable.</em>
The initial check for a and b being the same location in memory may be
omitted when you know this can&#39;t happen.  (The compiler may omit it anyway
as an optimization.)  If you enable overflows exceptions, then pass unsigned 
values so an exception isn&#39;t thrown.

The XOR method that follows may be slightly faster on some machines. 
Don&#39;t use this with floating-point numbers (unless you operate on
their raw integer representations).

This is an old trick to exchange the values of the variables a and b 
<em>without using extra space for a temporary variable</em>.
<p>
On January 20, 2005, Iain A. Fleming pointed out that the macro above 
doesn&#39;t work when you swap with the same memory location, such as
SWAP(a[i], a[j]) with i == j.  So if that may occur, consider
defining the macro as 
(((a) == (b)) || (((a) ^= (b)), ((b) ^= (a)), ((a) ^= (b)))).
On July 14, 2009, Hallvard Furuseth suggested that on some machines,
(((a) ^ (b)) &amp;&amp; ((b) ^= (a) ^= (b), (a) ^= (b))) might be faster, 
since the (a) ^ (b) expression is reused.

</pre>
As an example of swapping ranges of bits
suppose we have have b = <b>001</b>0<b>111</b>1 
(expressed in binary) and we want to swap the n = 3 consecutive bits
starting at i = 1 (the second bit from the right) with the 3 consecutive
bits starting at j = 5; the result would be r = 
<b>111</b>0<b>001</b>1 (binary).
<p>
This method of swapping is similar to the general purpose XOR swap
trick, but intended for operating on individual bits.   The variable x 
stores the result of XORing the pairs of bit values we want to swap, 
and then the bits are set to the result of themselves XORed with x.   
Of course, the result is undefined if the sequences overlap.

On July 14, 2009 Hallvard Furuseth suggested that I change the

b = (b * 0x0202020202ULL &amp; 0x010884422010ULL) % 1023;
</pre>

The multiply operation creates five separate copies of the 8-bit 
byte pattern to fan-out into a 64-bit value.
The AND operation selects the bits that are in the correct (reversed) 
positions, relative to each 10-bit groups of bits.
The multiply and the AND operations copy the bits from the original 
byte so they each appear in only one of the 10-bit sets.  
The reversed positions of the bits from the original byte coincide with
their relative positions within any 10-bit set.

The last step, which involves modulus division by 2^10 - 1, has the
effect of merging together each set of 10 bits 
(from positions 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, ...) in the 64-bit value.  
They do not overlap, so the addition steps underlying the
modulus division behave like or operations.

Note that the last two steps can be combined on some processors because 
the registers can be accessed as bytes; 
just multiply so that a register stores the upper 32 bits of the result

The following variation is also O(lg(N)), however it requires more

by computing the constants on the fly.

<pre>unsigned int s = sizeof(v) * CHAR_BIT; // bit size; must be power of 2 
unsigned int mask = ~0;

  mask ^= (mask &lt;&lt; s);
  v = ((v &gt;&gt; s) &amp; mask) | ((v &lt;&lt; s) &amp; ~mask);
}
</pre>

These methods above are best suited to situations where N is large.
If you use the above with 64-bit ints (or larger), then you need
to add more lines (following the pattern); otherwise only the lower
32 bits will be reversed and the result will be in the lower 32 bits.

This method of finding modulus division by an integer that is one less 
than a power of 2 takes at most O(lg(N)) time, where N is the number of
bits in the numerator (32 bits, for the code above).  
The number of operations is at most 12 + 9 * ceil(lg(N)).

The tables may be removed if you know
the denominator at compile time; just extract the few relevent entries
and unroll the loop.  It may be easily extended to more bits.
<p>
It finds the result by summing the values in base (1 &lt;&lt; s) in parallel.
First every other base (1 &lt;&lt; s) value is added to the previous one.
Imagine that the result is written on a piece of paper.  Cut the paper
in half, so that half the values are on each cut piece.  Align the values
and sum them onto a new piece of paper.  Repeat by cutting this paper 
in half (which will be a quarter of the size of the previous one) 
and summing, until you cannot cut further.  After performing lg(N/s/2)
cuts, we cut no more; just continue to add the values and put the result 
onto a new piece of paper as before, while there are at least two s-bit
values.

Devised by Sean Anderson, August 20, 2001.  A typo was spotted by 
Randy E. Bryant on May 3, 2005 (after pasting the code, I had later 
added &#34;unsinged&#34; to a variable declaration).  As in the previous hack,
I mistakenly commented that we could alternatively assign 
<code>m = ((m + 1) &amp; d) - 1;</code> at the end, and Don Knuth corrected 
me on April 19, 2006 and suggested 
<code>m = m &amp; -((signed)(m - d) &gt;&gt; s)</code>.  
On June 18, 2009 Sean Irvine proposed a change that used
<code>((n &gt;&gt; s) &amp; M[s])</code> instead of 
<code>((n &amp; ~M[s]) &gt;&gt; s)</code>,
which typically requires fewer operations because the M[s] constant is already 
loaded.

The code above loads a 64-bit (IEEE-754 floating-point) double with 
a 32-bit integer (with no paddding bits) by storing the integer in the 
mantissa while the exponent is set to 2<sup>52</sup>.  
From this newly minted double,
2<sup>52</sup> (expressed as a double) is subtracted, which sets the 
resulting exponent to the log base 2 of the input value, v.  All that is 
left is shifting the exponent bits into position (20 bits right) and 
subtracting the bias, 0x3FF (which is 1023 decimal).  This technique
only takes 5 operations, but many CPUs are slow at manipulating doubles, 
and the endianess of the architecture must be accommodated.

Eric Cole sent me this on January 15, 2006.  Evan Felix pointed out a typo

The lookup table method takes only about 7 operations to find the log of
a 32-bit value.  If extended for 64-bit quantities, it would take roughly 
9 operations.  Another operation can be trimmed off by using four tables, 
with the possible additions incorporated into each.  Using int table 
elements may be faster, depending on your architecture.
<p>
The code above is tuned to uniformly distributed <em>output</em> values.  
If your <em>inputs</em> are evenly distributed across all 32-bit values, 
then consider using the following:
</p><pre>if (tt = v &gt;&gt; 24) 
{
  r = 24 + LogTable256[tt];
} 
else if (tt = v &gt;&gt; 16)

{
  r = 8 + LogTable256[tt];
} 
else 
{
  r = LogTable256[v];
}
</pre>

To initially generate the log table algorithmically:
<pre>LogTable256[0] = LogTable256[1] = 0;
for (int i = 2; i &lt; 256; i++) 
{
  LogTable256[i] = 1 + LogTable256[i / 2];
}
LogTable256[0] = -1; // if you want log(0) to return -1
</pre>

Behdad Esfahbod and I shaved off a fraction of an operation (on average) on
May 18, 2005.  Yet another fraction of an operation was removed on November
14, 2006 by Emanuel Hoogeveen.  The variation that is tuned to evenly 
distributed input values was suggested by David A. Butterfield on September
19, 2008.  Venkat Reddy told me on January 5, 2009 that log(0) should return
-1 to indicate an error, so I changed the first entry in the table to that.

Of course, to extend the code to find the log of a 33- to 64-bit 
number, we would append another element, 0xFFFFFFFF00000000, to b,
append 32 to S, and loop from 5 to 0.  This method is much slower
than the earlier table-lookup version, but if you don&#39;t want big table
or your architecture is slow to access memory, it&#39;s a good choice.
The second variation involves slightly more operations, but it may be 
faster on machines with high branch costs (e.g. PowerPC).
<p>
The second version was sent to me by 
<a href="http://www.balance-software.com/ec/">Eric Cole</a> 
on January 7, 2006.  Andrew Shapira subsequently trimmed a few operations
off of it and sent me his variation (above) on Sept. 1, 2007.
The third variation was suggested to me by 
<a href="http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/">John Owens</a> 
on April 24, 2002; it&#39;s faster, but 
<em>it is only suitable when the input is known to be a power of 2</em>.
On May 25, 2003, Ken Raeburn suggested improving the general case by 
using smaller numbers for b[], which load faster on some architectures
(for instance if the word size is 16 bits, then only one load instruction 
may be needed).  These values work for the general version, but not for 
the special-case version below it, where v is a power of 2; Glenn Slayden 
brought this oversight to my attention on December 12, 2003.

t = (IntegerLogBase2(v) + 1) * 1233 &gt;&gt; 12; // (use a lg2 method from above)
r = t - (v &lt; PowersOf10[t]);
</pre>

The integer log base 10 is computed by first using one of the techniques above 
for finding the log base 2.  By the relationship 
log<sub>10</sub>(v) = log<sub>2</sub>(v) / log<sub>2</sub>(10), we need to
multiply it by 1/log<sub>2</sub>(10), which is approximately 1233/4096, or
1233 followed by a right shift of 12.  Adding one is needed because the
IntegerLogBase2 rounds down.  Finally, since the value t is only an 
approximation that may be off by one, the exact value is found by 
subtracting the result of v &lt; PowersOf10[t].
<p>
This method takes 6 more operations than
IntegerLogBase2.  It may be sped up (on machines with fast memory access)
by modifying the log base 2 table-lookup method above so that the entries
hold what is computed for t (that is, pre-add, -mulitply, and -shift).
Doing so would require a total of only 9 operations to find the log base 10,
assuming 4 tables were used (one for each byte of v).

This method works well when the input is uniformly distributed over 32-bit
values because 76% of the inputs are caught by the first compare, 21%
are caught by the second compare, 2% are caught by the third, and so on
(chopping the remaining down by 90% with each comparision).  
As a result, less than 2.6 operations are needed on average.

The above is fast, but IEEE 754-compliant architectures utilize 
<em>subnormal</em> (also called <em>denormal</em>) 
floating point numbers.  These have the exponent bits set to zero 
(signifying pow(2,-127)), 
and the mantissa is not normalized, so it contains leading zeros and
thus the log2 must be computed from the mantissa.  To accomodate for
subnormal numbers, use the following:

<pre>const float v;              // find int(log2(v)), where v &gt; 0.0 &amp;&amp; finite(v)
int c;                      // 32-bit int c gets the result;

Here, we are basically doing the same operations as finding the log base 2 
in parallel, but we first isolate the lowest 1 bit, and then proceed with
c starting at the maximum and decreasing.  
The number of operations is at most 3 * lg(N) + 4, roughly, for N bit words.

}	
</pre>

The code above is similar to the previous method, but it computes the number
of trailing zeros by accumulating c in a manner akin to binary search.
In the first step, it checks if the bottom 16 bits of v are zeros, 
and if so, shifts v right 16 bits and adds 16 to c, which reduces the 
number of bits in v to consider by half.  Each of the subsequent 
conditional steps likewise halves the number of bits until there is only 1.
This method is faster than the last one (by about 33%) because the bodies 
of the if statements are executed less often.
<p>
Matt Whitlock suggested this on January 25, 2006.  Andrew Shapira shaved
a couple operations off on Sept. 5, 2007 (by setting c=1 and unconditionally
subtracting at the end).

Although this only takes about 6 operations, the time to convert
an integer to a float can be high on some machines.  
The exponent of the 32-bit IEEE floating point 
representation is shifted down, and the bias is subtracted to give
the position of the least significant 1 bit set in v.
If v is zero, then the result is -127.

  20, 8, 19, 18
};
r = Mod37BitPosition[(-v &amp; v) % 37];
</pre>

The code above finds the number of zeros that are trailing on the right, so
binary 0100 would produce 2.  It makes use of the fact that the first 32
bit position values are relatively prime with 37, so performing a modulus 
division with 37 gives a unique number from 0 to 36 for each.  These numbers
may then be mapped to the number of zeros using a small lookup table.  
It uses only 4 operations, however indexing into a table and performing modulus
division may make it unsuitable for some situations.
I came up with this independently and then searched for a subsequence of 
the table values, and found it was invented earlier by Reiser, according to

Converting bit vectors to indices of set bits is an example use for this.  
It requires one more operation than the earlier one involving
modulus division, but the multiply may be faster.  The expression 
(v &amp; -v) extracts the least significant 1 bit from v.  The constant 
0x077CB531UL is a de Bruijn sequence, which produces a unique pattern 
of bits into the high 5 bits for each possible bit position that it is 
multiplied against.  When there are no bits set, it returns 0.

<h3>
<a name="RoundUpPowerOf2">Round up to the next highest power of 2

<pre>unsigned int v; // compute the next highest power of 2 of 32-bit v

v--;

v |= v &gt;&gt; 2;
v |= v &gt;&gt; 4;
v |= v &gt;&gt; 8;
v |= v &gt;&gt; 16;
v++;
</pre>

In 12 operations, this code computes the next highest power of 2 for a 
32-bit integer.
The result may be expressed by the formula 1U &lt;&lt; (lg(v - 1) + 1).  
Note that in the edge case where v is 0, it returns 0, which isn&#39;t a
power of 2; you might append the expression v += (v == 0) to remedy this
if it matters.
It would be faster by 2 operations to use the formula and the 
log base 2 method that uses a lookup table, 
but in some situations, lookup tables are not suitable, so the above code
may be best.  (On a Athlon™ XP 2100+ I&#39;ve found the above shift-left 
and then OR code is as fast as using a single BSR assembly language 
instruction, which scans in reverse to find the highest set bit.)
It works by copying the highest set bit to all of the lower 
bits, and then adding one, which results in carries that set all of the lower
bits to 0 and one bit beyond the highest set bit to 1.  If the original
number was a power of 2, then the decrement will reduce it to one less, so
that we round up to the same original value.
<p>
You might alternatively compute the next higher power of 2 
in only 8 or 9 operations using a lookup table for 
floor(lg(v)) and then evaluating 1&lt;&lt;(1+floor(lg(v))); 
Atul Divekar suggested I mention this on September 5, 2010.

bool hasZeroByte = ~((((v &amp; 0x7F7F7F7F) + 0x7F7F7F7F) | v) | 0x7F7F7F7F);
</pre>

The code above may be useful when doing a fast string copy in which a word 
is copied at a time; it uses 5 operations.  
On the other hand, testing for a null byte in the obvious ways (which follow)
have at least 7 operations (when counted in the most sparing way), and at most 12.

<pre>// More operations:
bool hasNoZeroByte = ((v &amp; 0xff) &amp;&amp; (v &amp; 0xff00) &amp;&amp; (v &amp; 0xff0000) &amp;&amp; (v &amp; 0xff000000))

unsigned char * p = (unsigned char *) &amp;v;  
bool hasNoZeroByte = *p &amp;&amp; *(p + 1) &amp;&amp; *(p + 2) &amp;&amp; *(p + 3);
</pre>

The code at the beginning of this section (labeled &#34;Fewer operations&#34;) 
works by first zeroing the high bits of the 4 bytes in the word.
Subsequently, it adds a number that will result in an overflow to 
the high bit of a byte if any of the low bits were initialy set.  
Next the high bits of the original word are ORed with these values; 
thus, the high bit of a byte is set iff any bit in the byte was set.  
Finally, we determine if any of these high bits are zero by ORing with 
ones everywhere except the high bits and inverting the result.  
Extending to 64 bits is trivial; simply increase the constants to be 
0x7F7F7F7F7F7F7F7F.
<p>
For an additional improvement, a fast pretest that requires only 4 operations
may be performed to determine if the word <em>may</em> have a zero byte.  
The test also returns true if the high byte is 0x80, so there are 
occasional false positives, but the slower and more reliable version 
above may then be used on candidates for an overall increase in speed with
correct output.

There is yet a faster method — 
use <a href="#HasLessInWord"><code>hasless</code></a>(v, 1),

</p><pre>#define haszero(v) (((v) - 0x01010101UL) &amp; ~(v) &amp; 0x80808080UL)</pre>
The subexpression (v - 0x01010101UL), evaluates to a high bit set in any
byte whenever the corresponding byte in v is zero or greater than 0x80.  
The sub-expression ~v &amp; 0x80808080UL 
evaluates to high bits set in bytes where the byte of v doesn&#39;t have its high 
bit set (so the byte was less than 0x80).  Finally, by ANDing these two 
sub-expressions the result is the high bits set where the bytes in v 
were zero, since the high bits set due to a value greater than 0x80 
in the first sub-expression are masked off by the second.

Paul Messmer suggested the fast pretest improvement on October 2, 2004.  
Juha Järvi later suggested <code>hasless(v, 1)</code>
on April 6, 2005, which
he found on <a href="http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/asmexample.html">Paul
Hsieh&#39;s Assembly Lab</a>; previously it was written in a newsgroup post 
on April 27, 1987 by Alan Mycroft.

<h3>
<a name="#ValueInWord">Determine if a word has a byte equal to n
</a>
</h3>

We may want to know if any byte in a word has a specific value.  To do so,
we can XOR the value to test with a word that has been filled with the 
byte values in which we&#39;re interested.  Because XORing a value with itself
results in a zero byte and nonzero otherwise, we can pass the result to 
<code>haszero</code>.

<pre>#define hasvalue(x,n) \
(haszero((x) ^ (~0UL/255 * (n))))
</pre>
<p>
Stephen M Bennet suggested this on December 13, 2009 after reading the entry
for <code>haszero</code>.

<h3>
<a name="HasLessInWord">Determine if a word has a byte less than n
</a>
</h3>


Test if a word x contains an unsigned byte with value &lt; n.
Specifically for n=1, it can be used to find a 0-byte by examining one
long at a time, or any byte by XORing x with a mask first.
Uses 4 arithmetic/logical operations when n is constant.
<p>
Requirements: x&gt;=0; 0&lt;=n&lt;=128

</p><pre>#define hasless(x,n) (((x)-~0UL/255*(n))&amp;~(x)&amp;~0UL/255*128)
</pre>
To count the number of bytes in x that are less than n in 7 operations, use
<pre>#define countless(x,n) \
(((~0UL/255*(127+(n))-((x)&amp;~0UL/255*127))&amp;~(x)&amp;~0UL/255*128)/128%255)
</pre>

<p>
Juha Järvi sent this clever technique to me on April 6, 2005.  The
<code>countless</code> macro was added by Sean Anderson on 
April 10, 2005, inspired by Juha&#39;s <code>countmore</code>, below.

<h3>
<a name="HasMoreInWord">Determine if a word has a byte greater than n
</a>
</h3>

Test if a word x contains an unsigned byte with value &gt; n.  
Uses 3 arithmetic/logical operations when n is constant.
<p>
Requirements: x&gt;=0; 0&lt;=n&lt;=127
</p><pre>#define hasmore(x,n) (((x)+~0UL/255*(127-(n))|(x))&amp;~0UL/255*128)
</pre>
To count the number of bytes in x that are more than n in 6 operations, use:
<pre>#define countmore(x,n) \
(((((x)&amp;~0UL/255*127)+~0UL/255*(127-(n))|(x))&amp;~0UL/255*128)/128%255)
</pre>
<p>
The macro <code>hasmore</code> was suggested by Juha Järvi on 
April 6, 2005, and he added <code>countmore</code> on April 8, 2005.

<h3>
<a name="HasBetweenInWord">Determine if a word has a byte between m and n
</a>
</h3>

When m &lt; n, this technique tests if a word x contains an 
unsigned byte value, such that m &lt; value &lt; n.  
<!--When m > n, it tests for byte values
outside the range; that is value < n and m <= value.-->
It uses 7 arithmetic/logical operations when n and m are constant.
<p>
Note:  Bytes that equal n can be reported by <code>likelyhasbetween</code>
as false positives,
so this should be checked by character if a certain result is needed.
</p><p>
Requirements: x&gt;=0; 0&lt;=m&lt;=127; 0&lt;=n&lt;=128
</p><pre>#define likelyhasbetween(x,m,n) \
((((x)-~0UL/255*(n))&amp;~(x)&amp;((x)&amp;~0UL/255*127)+~0UL/255*(127-(m)))&amp;~0UL/255*128)
</pre>
This technique would be suitable for a fast pretest.  A variation that
takes one more operation (8 total for constant m and n)
but provides the exact answer is:
<pre>#define hasbetween(x,m,n) \
((~0UL/255*(127+(n))-((x)&amp;~0UL/255*127)&amp;~(x)&amp;((x)&amp;~0UL/255*127)+~0UL/255*(127-(m)))&amp;~0UL/255*128)
</pre>
To count the number of bytes in x that are between m and n (exclusive)
in 10 operations, use:
<pre>#define countbetween(x,m,n) (hasbetween(x,m,n)/128%255)
</pre>
<p>
Juha Järvi suggested <code>likelyhasbetween</code> on April 6, 2005.  
From there,
Sean Anderson created <code>hasbetween</code> and 
<code>countbetween</code> on April 10, 2005.

<h3>
<a name="NextBitPermutation">Compute the lexicographically next bit permutation
</a>
</h3>

Suppose we have a pattern of N bits set to 1 in an integer and we want the 
next permutation of N 1 bits in a lexicographical sense.  
For example, if N is 3 and the bit pattern is 00010011, the next patterns 
would be 00010101, 00010110, 00011001,00011010, 00011100, 00100011, 
and so forth.  The following is a fast way to compute the next permutation.

<pre>unsigned int v; // current permutation of bits 
unsigned int w; // next permutation of bits

unsigned int t = v | (v - 1); // t gets v&#39;s least significant 0 bits set to 1
// Next set to 1 the most significant bit to change, 
// set to 0 the least significant ones, and add the necessary 1 bits.
w = (t + 1) | (((~t &amp; -~t) - 1) &gt;&gt; (__builtin_ctz(v) + 1));  
</pre>

The __builtin_ctz(v) GNU C compiler intrinsic for x86 CPUs returns the 
number of trailing zeros.  If you are using Microsoft compilers for x86, 
the intrinsic is _BitScanForward.  These both emit a bsf instruction, but
equivalents may be available for other architectures.  If not, then 
consider using one of the methods for counting the consecutive zero bits
mentioned earlier.
<p>
Here is another version that tends to be slower because of its
division operator, but it does not require counting the trailing zeros.
</p><pre>unsigned int t = (v | (v - 1)) + 1;  
w = t | ((((t &amp; -t) / (v &amp; -v)) &gt;&gt; 1) - 1);  
</pre>
