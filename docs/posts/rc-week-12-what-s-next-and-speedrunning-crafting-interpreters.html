    <h1>RC Week 12: What&#39;s Next, and Speedrunning Crafting Interpreters</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    

    <p><strong>Saturday, December 10, 2022</strong></p>

    <p>And that&#39;s it.
My batch at RC ended yesterday.
I have so many thoughts and feelings from this time, but it&#39;s going to take time to coalesce them all.
I&#39;ll write up my Return Statement<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> in a week or two, but for now, here&#39;s what I was up to the last week!</p>
<p>Mostly, this last week was an attempt to speedrun <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a>.
This book has been on my shelf for a while, and I got started on it after I decided to stop learning Idris.
A friend from this batch has done really cool work going through Crafting Interpreters, so I wanted to see how much I could get through while we can still easily pair program on it.</p>
<p>Turns out, a lot!
In the last 1.5 weeks or so, I read through the first 11 chapters and implemented everything from the first 10.
All that&#39;s left is doing chapter 11 (which should fix a hole in the semantics and improve performance) and then read two chapters focused on classes!
It&#39;ll be really cool to see how object-oriented programming can be implemented at the language level.</p>
<p>Overall this book has been a great experience so far.
So far the benefits have been:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Greater mechanical sympathy for parsers.</strong>
It&#39;s easier to understand errors coming out of a parser having written a basic one!
Now when parsers leak some details out in errors, it&#39;s less confusing.
This alone is <strong>a great reason to read the book.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Got over my fear of parsers/interpreters.</strong>
Before this, parsing was very intimidating.
I wrote a little parser for my chess projects to load in <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Portable_Game_Notation">PGN files</a>, but that was hard and confusing and didn&#39;t work well.
Now that I&#39;ve seen a reasonably-structured parser and written it myself, I&#39;m a lot more confident that I can and will write more parsers in the future!
I&#39;m currently planning on implementing a query language for <a href="https://sr.ht/%7Entietz/isabella-db/">my chess database</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Gaining a better appreciation for the nice things we have.</strong>
After writing this much of a language, honestly, I&#39;m extremely impressed and grateful that <strong>other languages work well at all</strong>. This stuff is <em>hard</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m going to keep running through Crafting Interpreters over the next few weeks, but with less intensity since I&#39;m going back to work on Monday.
I think part 2 will be just as fruitful as part 1, since I&#39;ll get to see how a (bytecode) compiler works!
Maybe my chess database query language will compile down to bytecode for the query engine ðŸ˜Ž.</p>
<p>This week also contained a one-day build of a useful tool for my own use.
Since I wrote about that <a href="https://slimvoice.co/blog/one-day-build-molecule-reader/">earlier this week</a>, I won&#39;t say much here except that I think the reports of Rust being bad for prototyping are are greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>This week has also led to me leaning into doing type-driven development with Rust, and leveraging tooling to generate a lot more of my code for me.
(Not AI generation, but automatic generation of some boilerplate.)
I&#39;ll write more about that soon, too.</p>
<p>The rest of this week was coffee chats with folks and reflections on our batches and what is next for us.
I&#39;m really excited to see what all my new friends end up doing next.
And I hope they stay in touch and stay active on Zulip.</p>
<p>As for me, I spent some time this week making sure that my life is structured in a way that means I can keep doing some of the most rewarding things from RC.
Specifically, that means <strong>I&#39;ve let go of some projects</strong> (Advent of Code, learning theorem provers with friends) to be able to focus on the things that are most important to me.
Here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to keep on with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistent writing.</strong>
This has been tremendously rewarding, and I&#39;m going to keep up with it post-batch as well as I can.
I&#39;ve setup a dedicated chunk of writing focus time each week, with some folks joining in.
I&#39;m optimistic.</li>
<li><strong>Crafting Interpreters and other technical books.</strong>
This book is such a joy, and it&#39;s inspirational for me.
This is the sort of writing I aspire to eventually.
I&#39;m going to keep up with it and then work some other technical books, like <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/cpython-internals-your-guide-to-the-python-3-interpreter-anthony-shaw/16978914">CPython Internals</a> (we have a reading group starting in January!).</li>
<li><strong>The chess database.</strong>
This project has taught me so much, and is useful to boot.
I&#39;m going to keep going with it as a slow burn so that it&#39;s sustainable and keeps going.</li>
<li><strong>Coffee chats.</strong>
Everyone at RC has been so great, so I&#39;m going to keep in touch with folks.
A lower intensity and lower frequency, but still there.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next two weeks, I should have a Return Statement posted.
I have a few other blog posts in the works, too.
If you made it this far, thanks for reading!</p>

<div id="1"><p><sup>1</sup></p><p>Return Statements are a tradition where Recursers write a post about what they did there and some reflections.
I&#39;m waiting a few weeks for everything to gel before writing mine, because right now I&#39;m a maelstrom of feelings.</p>
