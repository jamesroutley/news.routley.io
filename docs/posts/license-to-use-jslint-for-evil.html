    <h1>License to Use JSLint for Evil</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>From a tech talk about the history of JSON</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130203112329/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C-JoyNuQJs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=2480s" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C-JoyNuQJs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=2480s</a></p>

<p>(Note: Douglas Crockford put the following clause in the JSON license “The Software should be used for Good, not Evil.”)</p>

<p>About once a year, I get a letter from a lawyer, every year a different lawyer, at a company – I don’t want to embarrass the company by saying their name, so I’ll just say their initials – IBM…</p>

<p>[laughter]</p>

<p>…saying that they want to use something I wrote. Because I put this on everything I write, now. They want to use something that I wrote in something that they wrote, and they were pretty sure they weren’t going to use it for evil, but they couldn’t say for sure about their customers. So could I give them a special license for that?</p>

<p>Of course. So I wrote back – this happened literally two weeks ago – “I give permission for IBM, its customers, partners, and minions, to use JSLint for evil.”</p>

<p>[laughter and applause]</p>

<p>And the attorney wrote back and said: “Thanks very much, Douglas!”</p>
