    <h1>Ask HN: Discord banned me with no recourse</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I recently tried to make a separate work account in Discord.
To do so I created a new account with my main accounts phone number. This caused discord to delete my primary account phone number and used it for the new account.<p>However, this alone caused me to be instantly banned.
After reaching out to support, they basically told that me I could not use my present phone number for verification and that they couldn&#39;t tell me why, and couldn&#39;t help me further with that.</p><p>I would really like to keep my primary Discord account, is there anything I can do about it?</p><p>I have contacted Discord support through their ticket system twice, I have contacted Discord on Twitter (DM); but to no avail</p></div></div>
