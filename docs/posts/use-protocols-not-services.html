    <p>
      The Internet is almost anonymous and privacy-preserving by design. I mean,
      unless some administrator actively tries to track you, there is no
      built-in identity layer. What breaks both properties is the centralization
      of communication onto closed platforms, where identification becomes
      possible either by the hosting company itself, or by governments
      compelling them to cooperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      After recent events, it is time for us to start using protocols again
      instead of services.
    </p>

    <h2>Services are easy targets</h2>

    <p>
      A government that wants to identify users, censor content, or enforce
      compliance only needs to send one letter to one company. One subpoena, one
      court order, one regulatory demand: the service likely complies or faces
      fines, lawsuits, or bans.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is happening right now. Governments worldwide are passing laws that
      require platforms to verify the age of their users. Discord is voluntarily
      rolling out mandatory &#34;teen-by-default&#34; settings until proof of majority
      (by submitting a face scan or, God forbid, a government-issued ID), likely
      anticipating future regulatory obligations.
    </p>

    <p>
      None of this could happen with a protocol. You cannot require age
      verification on IRC, XMPP,
      <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>,
      <a href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</a>, or
      <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>, because there is no single
      entity to compel. Each server operator makes their own decisions. A
      government would need to individually pressure thousands of independent
      operators across dozens of jurisdictions, which is a legislative and
      enforcement impossibility. And even if one server complied, users would
      simply move to another.
    </p>

    <h2>Switching services solves nothing</h2>

    <p>
      After Discord&#39;s announcement, the instinct is to migrate to another
      service. This is pointless. The new service will either operate under the
      same jurisdiction and face the same rules, or it will be offshore and
      eventually blocked or pressured once it becomes large enough to matter.
      You are just moving from one regulable entity to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual solution is to stop depending on a specific commercial service
      and start using a protocol. This is not a radical idea. We already do it
      with email. SMTP is a protocol. You can switch providers, self-host, or
      use any combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Email may not seem to be the best example since it has become an oligopoly
      where Google, Microsoft, and maybe also Apple control the vast majority of
      the email infrastructure. But actually, this is a good example to show how
      protocols are resilient. Let&#39;s say Google bans your account, then you can
      move to another provider and still reach every Gmail user. In a more
      extreme scenario, let&#39;s even say Google and Microsoft discontinue their
      service (in your specific region, for example), even block any inbound
      message from you. Not ideal, but <em>SMTP implementations still exist and
        they still work</em> even in a very degraded mode. You&#39;d need to migrate
      (as well as some of your connections), but there is absolutely no need to
      reimplement anything. That is the difference with a service like Discord.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a centralized service, if your account is deleted or banned, you are
      gone for good.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Use protocols
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every time we choose a service over a protocol, we opt into a system where
      a single company can be compelled to <strong>identify us, restrict us, or
        hand over our data</strong>, to their profit or out government&#39;s
      advantage.
