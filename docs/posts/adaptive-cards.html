			<p>Adaptive Cards are platform-agnostic snippets of UI, authored in JSON, that apps and services can openly exchange. When delivered to a specific app, the JSON is transformed into native UI that automatically adapts to its surroundings. It helps design and integrate light-weight UI for all major platforms and frameworks.</p>

		<p>There&#39;s an ecosystem of developers out there who want to integrate with your apps, but how can you do so safely and without their content sticking out like a sore thumb? Adaptive Cards are always native and blend seamlessly into the surrounding UI - and they work on every major platform!</p>

		<h2>Design cards anywhere</h2>
		<p>You don&#39;t have to send your users to this website to design cards. Just like Adaptive Cards blend into their surroundings, so does the Adaptive Card Designer. The SDK includes a full configuration API allowing you to deeply integrate card workflows into your existing toolchain.</p>

		<h2>Create, share, and discover reusable templates</h2>
		<p>What if you could instantly display any type of data? It could be your own app&#39;s data, your organization&#39;s data, or data from the web. With Adaptive Card Templating you can separate the data from card layout, and when coupled with a new template service a whole new ecosystem of card exchange becomes possible.</p>
