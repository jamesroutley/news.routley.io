<p>Welcome to <strong>&#34;100 Exercises To Learn Rust&#34;</strong>!</p>
<p>This course will teach you Rust&#39;s core concepts, one exercise at a time.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t assume any prior knowledge of Rust, but we assume you know at least
another programming language.</p>
<p>In other words, we&#39;ll be starting from scratch!</p>
<h2 id="methodology"><a href="#methodology">Methodology</a></h2>
<p>This course is based on the &#34;learn by doing&#34; principle.</p>
<p><a href="https://mainmatter.com/rust-consulting/">Mainmatter</a> developed this course
to be delivered in a classroom setting, over 4 days: each attendee advances
through the lessons at their own pace, with an experienced instructor providing
guidance, answering questions and diving deeper into the topics as needed.</p>
<p>You can also follow the course on your own, but we recommend you find a friend or
a mentor to help you along the way should you get stuck. You can
also find solutions to all exercises in the
<a href="https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust/tree/solutions"><code>solutions</code> branch of the GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="structure"><a href="#structure">Structure</a></h2>
<p>On the left side of the screen, you can see that the course is divided into sections.
Each section introduces a new concept or feature of the Rust language.</p>
<p>You can find the exercises in the
<a href="https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust">companion GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<pre><code># If you have an SSH key set up with GitHub
git clone git@github.com:mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust.git
# Otherwise, use the HTTPS URL:
#
#   git clone https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust.git
</code></pre>
<p>We also recommend you work on a branch, so you can easily track your progress and pull
in updates from the main repository, if needed:</p>
<pre><code>cd 100-exercises-to-learn-rust
git checkout -b my-solutions
</code></pre>
<p>All exercises are located in the <code>exercises</code> folder.
Each exercise is structured as a Rust package.
The package contains the exercise itself, instructions on what to do (in <code>src/lib.rs</code>), and a test suite to
automatically verify your solution.</p>
<h3 id="wr-the-workshop-runner"><a href="#wr-the-workshop-runner"><code>wr</code>, the workshop runner</a></h3>
<p>To verify your solutions, we&#39;ve provided a tool that will guide you through the course.
It is the <code>wr</code> CLI (short for &#34;workshop runner&#34;).
Install it with:</p>
<pre><code>cargo install --locked workshop-runner
</code></pre>
<p>In a new terminal, navigate back to the top-level folder of the repository.
Run the <code>wr</code> command to start the course:</p>
<pre><code>wr
</code></pre>
<p><code>wr</code> will verify the solution to the current exercise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recommend committing your solutions to Git as you progress through the course,
so you can easily track your progress and &#34;restart&#34; from a known point if needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enjoy the course!</p>
