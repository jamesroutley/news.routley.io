        <p>For a long time we dreampt of bringing our meal planning app <a href="https://www.mealpreppro.com/?ref=andreaskambanis.com">MealPrepPro</a> to Android. To generate interest in the launch, I thought I&#39;d try out a pre-registration campaign for the Google Play store.</p><h2 id="how-pre-registration-works">How pre-registration works</h2><p>Using pre-registration, people who are interested in your app can register to download it.</p><p>Here&#39;s how it looks in the Google Play Store:</p><figure><img src="https://andreaskambanis.com/content/images/2022/11/Android-pre-orders.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1364" srcset="https://andreaskambanis.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/Android-pre-orders.png 600w, https://andreaskambanis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/Android-pre-orders.png 1000w, https://andreaskambanis.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/11/Android-pre-orders.png 1600w, https://andreaskambanis.com/content/images/2022/11/Android-pre-orders.png 2200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>People tap on pre-register and then on the launch day the app gets downloaded.</p><p>You can setup a pre-registration campaign up to 90 days before your app launch.</p><h2 id="enter-google-ads">Enter Google Ads</h2><p>To boost our pre-registrations, I also setup a Google Ads pre-registration campaign.</p><p>We let the ads run and kept an eye on the cost per conversion.</p><p>In the mean time, things got busy with beta testing and getting our app ready for launch.</p><h2 id="launch-day">Launch day</h2><p>On the 24th of October, it was time to launch MealPrepPro.</p><p>Google Ads reported we had 16,171 pre-registrations.

Surely, there&#39;s been a mistake. Perhaps there was an issue in Google Ads or an issue with how Pre-Registration works in the Google Play store.</p><p>Time to contact Google support.</p><p>Initially the Google rep said our ad campaign doesn&#39;t have any assets (You don&#39;t need any for a pre-registration campaign). Then they told us we actually have 29,767 installs. Which is not true. That number refers to a separate app campaign we&#39;d run years ago.</p><p>We spent weeks going back and forward, getting nowhere. Eventually, exhausted and demotivated we gave up. Google saw no issue in charging $20k+ for 16,171 conversions, but only giving us 1,371.</p><h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2><p>We used a Google Ads pre-registration campaign to get installs for our app. We paid for 16,171 conversions. We only received 1,371 installs.</p><h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2><p>MealPrepPro is built by a small indie dev team and $20k was a painful amount of money for us to waste. With pre-registration ads you&#39;re putting all your faith in Google that they&#39;ll deliver the conversions they&#39;re showing in the ads reports. It&#39;s not until you launch that you&#39;ll actually see how many install. I would never use pre-registration ads again.</p>
