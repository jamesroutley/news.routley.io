Well… <em>sorta</em>. Sega enjoyed quite a success with the Mega Drive so there’s no reason to force developers to write 3D games <em>right now</em>.</p><p>Just in case developers want the extra dimension, Sega adapted some bits of the hardware to enable polygon drawing as well. Hopefully, the result didn’t get out of hand!</p><hr/><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Just like its close competitors <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#a-bit-of-history">drowned with options</a> during the RISC fever, Sega had to go through all the conundrums of choosing a new vendor that could bring up the next generation of games (including those with ‘3D’ capabilities). In the end, the company chose a fresh CPU whose creator was desperately looking for an adopter, the <strong>Hitachi SuperH</strong> or ‘SH’.</p><p>While initially focused on embedded applications, Hitachi’s new creation debuted modern arts such as <sup id="bibref:1"><a href="#bib:cpu-prog_manual" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>A <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#tab-1-4-cisc-or-risc">load-store architecture</a>, meaning instructions don’t mix memory and register operations, resulting in a cleaner and scalable CPU design. This is one of the pillars of RISC CPUs.</li><li><strong>32-bit data bus and ALU</strong>, enabling to move and operate larger amounts of data (32-bit values) without consuming extra cycles.</li><li><strong>16 general-purpose 32-bit registers</strong>, which is double the amount of previous CPUs like the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/mega-drive-genesis/#cpu">Motorolla 68000</a>. This is another design decision derived from the RISC guidelines <sup id="bibref:2"><a href="#bib:cpu-patterson" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></sup>.</li><li><strong>32-bit address bus</strong>, allowing up to 4 GB of memory to be addressed (<em>farewell <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#going-beyond-existing-capabilities">mappers</a></em>).</li><li>A <strong>pipelined data path</strong> with <strong>five stages</strong>: The execution of instructions is now divided into five steps or <em>stages</em>. The CPU will queue up to five instructions and each one is allocated in one stage. This allows taking advantage of all the CPU’s resources without idling while also incrementing the number of instructions executed per unit of time.</li><li>A <strong>16-bit multiplication unit</strong>: Performs multiplications with 16-bit integers.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, the SuperH features a new instruction set called <strong>SuperH ISA</strong> which, apart from adopting a RISC design, <strong>all of its instructions are 16-bit wide</strong>. This comes as a surprise since this CPU operates 32-bit words, so you would expect instructions to have the same length. Yet, Hitachi managed to fit its ISA using half the size. Not only does this format reduce the size of programs, but since the CPU fetches instructions in 32-bit batches, <strong>two instructions can be retrieved in one cycle</strong>. Overall, this technique of compressing the instruction set helped tackle a common concern of RISC-based architectures called ‘code density’, where the latter required more instructions (therefore, more memory) to perform the same tasks as non-RISC systems.</p><p>Conversely, other drawbacks of RISC designs are still present in the SuperH, such as <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#delay-galore">control hazards</a>. Consequently, programs are required to include <strong>branch delay slots</strong> to avoid calculation errors. To remediate things, the SuperH features <strong>delayed branch instructions</strong> which are branch instructions pre-fitted with a delay slot.</p><h3 id="sega-is-not-satisfied">Sega is not satisfied</h3><p>Nevertheless, all of that didn’t stop Sega from expressing dissatisfaction with the end product. This was mainly due to the small 16-bit multiplier, which was seen as a bottleneck when processing larger amounts of data (a new need for 3D games). Thus, Hitachi synthesised a second revision with an extended multiplier unit and other requirements on Sega’s checklist <sup id="bibref:3"><a href="#bib:cpu-history" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></sup>, leading to a new CPU called <strong>SH-2</strong>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/sh2s.93e7ad76052cc0ac65d530f751c4fede4665f17d15fa22ff6d6586679b058506.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/_huba88a0028b93a412d89cfad4789263a2_175147_addfe0a24317362c6332a2050138e558.webp 500w,

So, it asked Hitachi to step up the clock frequency of the SH-2 - an impossible task once the chip is already out for manufacturing. Luckily, Hitachi had another trick up in their sleeve: <strong>multiprocessing</strong>. During the research phase of the SH, the team added minimal circuitry to allow the SH to work with other SHs within the same system at the same time. Upon hearing that, Sega decided on a two-chip configuration for the Sega Saturn. And the rest is history.</p><h3 id="the-final-product">The final product</h3><p>Having explained the origins, let’s take a look at the shipped product.</p><p>This console has not one but <strong>two Hitachi SH-2</strong> CPUs running at <strong>~28.63 MHz each</strong> <sup id="bibref:4"><a href="#bib:cpu-overview" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></sup>. While both physically identical, they are placed in a <strong>master-slave state</strong>, where the first one may send commands to the second one. This can achieve some degree of parallelism, albeit both sharing the same external bus <sup id="bibref:5"><a href="#bib:cpu-dualcpu" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></sup> (which can lead to congestion).</p><p>Hitachi packaged different variants of the SH-2 and sold them as part of a series called ‘SH7600’. All of them feature <sup id="bibref:6"><a href="#bib:cpu-brief" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>The aforementioned <strong>five-stage pipeline</strong> and <strong>SuperH ISA</strong>. The latter has been extended with six additional instructions for specialised branching and arithmetic.</li><li>An upgraded <strong>32-bit multiplication unit</strong>, which now performs multiplication with 32-bit integers.</li><li>A <strong>32-bit external data bus</strong> that is shared across the two CPUs.</li></ul><p>The specific chip selected for this console, the ‘SH7604’, contains the following additions <sup id="bibref:7"><a href="#bib:cpu-prog_manual" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li><strong>4 KB of cache</strong>: Stores a small number of instructions and data previously fetched from memory to speed up future reads.</li><li>A <strong>32-bit division unit</strong>: Performs division with 32-bit integers.</li><li><strong>Internal DMA controller</strong>: Transfers data from memory without the intervention of the CPU.</li><li>Support for <strong>little endian</strong>, enabling the CPU to understand values encoded in the opposite order. This is useful when external memory is shared with other processors.</li></ul><p>It’s worth pointing out that <strong>having two CPUs doesn’t mean that games will work twice as fast!</strong> In practice, however, this requires very complex programming to efficiently manage CPUs that share the same bus. Thus, efficient use of the cache also plays a critical role in this console.</p><h3 id="a-divided-choice-of-memory">A divided choice of memory</h3><p>The Sega Saturn contains a total of <strong>2 MB of RAM</strong> for general-purpose usage called <strong>Work RAM</strong> (WRAM). Now, these two megs are split between two very different blocks:</p><ul><li>The first one provides <strong>1 MB of SDRAM</strong> and due to its fast access rates, this block is also called ‘WRAM-H’.</li><li>The other block contains the other megabyte, but it’s named ‘WRAM-L’ since it uses <strong>DRAM</strong> instead, resulting in lower rates.</li></ul><h3 id="the-third-processor-and-counting">The third processor (and counting)</h3><p>Surprisingly, it seems that the two SH-2 CPUs weren’t still enough for Sega. So, to accelerate vector processing (at the cost of more complexity), the console houses an additional coprocessor, the <strong>Saturn Control Unit</strong> or ‘SCU’.</p><p>This is a chip comprised of two modules <sup id="bibref:8"><a href="#bib:cpu-scu" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li><strong>A DMA controller</strong>: Arbitrates access to WRAM across the three main buses without the intervention of the CPUs.</li><li><strong>A DSP</strong>: Used as a fixed-point ‘geometry unit’. Compared to the SH-2, it does matrix/vectors calculations such as 3D transformations and lighting faster. However, it runs at half-speed and its instruction set is more complex. Moreover, it relies on the SH-2’s WRAM to fetch and store data (using the DMA).</li></ul><p>On the bright side, the SCU comes with <strong>32 KB of SRAM</strong> for local use. On the bad side, the SCU can’t access WRAM-L.</p><hr/><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>Since the Saturn is the first ‘3D console’ reviewed for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/">this series</a>, let us first go over the fundamental design changes that made way to the new generation of 3D graphics:</p><ul><li>The GPU now relies on a <strong>frame-buffer</strong>: Graphics are no longer required to be rendered on-the-fly. Instead, the GPU reserves a portion of VRAM to draw a bitmap with all the computed geometry requested by the CPU, and then a video encoder picks up that region and outputs it through the video signal.<ul><li>Consequently, having this reserved ‘working space’ allows the GPU to continue manipulating the bitmap even after finishing rendering the scene, so the CPU may now offload some exhaustive tasks such as lighting and anti-aliasing to the GPU. Here is when the term <strong>graphics pipeline</strong> starts to gain momentum.</li></ul></li><li><strong>More VRAM required</strong>: The use of a frame buffer implies an increment of memory requirements (which is not a big issue anymore), the amount of RAM required for a frame buffer is proportional to the dimension of the screen and the number of colours used. As an example, with 600 KB of VRAM we can contain a frame buffer of 640x480 pixels wide with 32k colours per pixel (16 bpp).<ul><li>Additionally, programmers are free to organise their VRAM usage: Not every single bit has to be allocated for the frame buffer, so why don’t we also use it to cache textures, render other frame-buffers concurrently and add colour lookup tables to speed things up?</li></ul></li><li>The CPU incorporates <strong>vector operations</strong>: A GPU with 3D capabilities would be incomplete without a proper CPU capable of feeding the required geometry. For that reason, next-gen CPUs include a form of specialised instructions that accelerates vector calculations, these are known as <strong>Single instruction multiple data</strong> or ‘SIMD’ extension.<ul><li>In the case of the Saturn, vector operations are accelerated by the Saturn Control Unit (not by the SH-2 CPUs).</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="segas-offering">Sega’s offering</h3><p>This console includes <strong>two proprietary GPUs</strong>, each one serving different purposes while working concurrently. Some may argue that the new GPUs are an evolution of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/mega-drive-genesis/#graphics">classic VDP</a>, while others may say it’s a complete redesign… I think it’s a bit of both.</p><p>Having said that, let’s take a look at the two chips.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-vdp1-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-vdp1">VDP1</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-vdp2-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-vdp2">VDP2</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-vdp1"><h4 id="tab-1-1-vdp1">VDP1</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/vdp/VDP1.fdad1a669a57458ce0a25a18bc77b259452f485cecbc146ad56eff227d371352.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="570" height="411" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/vdp/VDP1.fdad1a669a57458ce0a25a18bc77b259452f485cecbc146ad56eff227d371352.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>VDP1 Architecture.</figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>Video Display Processor 1</strong> (VDP1) is a chip that draws sprites with geometric transformations <sup id="bibref:9"><a href="#bib:graphics-vdp1" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></sup>. The results are written onto a frame buffer, which is in turn streamed to the VDP2 for display.</p><p>This chip is programmed by sending ‘drawing commands’ to it. So, programmers are provided with <strong>512 KB of dedicated RAM</strong> to store these drawing commands and the required materials (textures/tiles, colour lookup tables, etc).</p><p>Consequently, the VDP1 is designed to use <strong>quadrilaterals as primitives</strong>, which means that it can only compose models using 4-vertex polygons (sprites). The chip applies <strong>Forward Texture Mapping</strong> to connect texture points onto the quadrilateral, in that direction. It doesn’t come with any filtering/interpolation technique, so the calculations are subject to <strong>aliasing</strong>.</p><p>The VDP1 also provides this selection of effects:</p><ul><li>Two <strong>shading algorithms</strong> (Flat and Gouraud) for lighting.</li><li><strong>Anti-aliasing</strong>: In this case, it duplicates pixels to cover gaps during mapping.</li><li><strong>Clipping</strong> to discard polygons outside the camera’s viewport.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong> to blend two non-opaque bitmaps.</li></ul><p><strong>Two 256 KB frame buffer chips</strong> are available to concurrently draw new scenes of the game without breaking the current one being displayed. When the secondary buffer is finished being drawn, the VDP1 starts broadcasting the latter instead (<strong>page-flipping</strong>), and the cycle continues.</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-vdp2"><h4 id="tab-1-2-vdp2">VDP2</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/vdp/VDP2.b23bf279fc4d3d3a0f46ed7550fa3463341a71412266f51e1ee99d95d0bf7c52.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="585" height="504" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/vdp/VDP2.b23bf279fc4d3d3a0f46ed7550fa3463341a71412266f51e1ee99d95d0bf7c52.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>VDP2 Architecture.</figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>Video Display Processor 2</strong> (VDP2) specialises in rendering large (4096×4096 pixels) planes with transformations (rotation, scale and translation) applied on them <sup id="bibref:10"><a href="#bib:graphics-vdp2" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></sup>.</p><p>More importantly, the VDP2’s renders <strong>on-the-fly</strong> (without a frame-buffer) like previous <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/mega-drive-genesis/#constructing-the-frame">tile-based engines</a>. It can display up to <strong>16.7 million colours</strong> (24-bit). This chip is also responsible for displaying the VDP1’s buffer, which can also be transformed and/or mixed with the VDP2’s layers. The VDP2’s ‘frame’ is composed of up to four 2D planes and one 3D plane; or two 3D planes.</p><p>This chip relies on <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/mega-drive-genesis/#constructing-the-frame">tile-maps</a> to compose planes and performs <strong>perspective correction</strong> for 3D texture mapping, this is a more sophisticated approach which takes into account the depth value to compute rotations.</p><p>Effects available include <strong>multi-texturing</strong> (mapping more than one texture per polygon) and <strong>shadowing</strong>. With the latter, after the VDP2 receives the sprites generated by the VDP1, it can reduce their brightness and blend them with half-transparency. Nonetheless, the VDP2 only receives a sprite stream from the VDP1 (in pace with the CRT beam) so this function tends to be tricky to encode and operate.</p><p>This chip also houses <strong>4 KB of Colour RAM (CRAM)</strong> which is used to translate VDP1’s custom colour values (index colours) into 24-bit RGB colours.</p><p>Finally, even though the VDP2 is limited to two 3D planes, nothing prevents the CPU from using its VRAM as frame-buffer area to draw additional 2D or 3D graphics in software.</p><p>I recommend checking out the sources (at the end of the article) if this section got your attention, since the VDPs have a lot more quirks that are beyond the scope of this article.</p></div></div></div><h3 id="defining-the-problem">Defining the problem</h3><p>As you can see, the architecture of the graphics sub-system is quite complex, so it’s interpreted differently depending on the needs:</p><h3 id="as-a-powerful-2d-console">As a powerful 2D console</h3><p>The capabilities of the Saturn for drawing 2D scenes were huge compared to the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/mega-drive-genesis/">Mega Drive</a> or <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/super-nintendo/">SNES</a>, although they weren’t the main selling point of this console.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-sprites-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-sprites">Sprites</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-backgrounds-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-backgrounds">Backgrounds</a></li><li id="tab-2-3-result-link"><a href="#tab-2-3-result">Result</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-sprites"><h4 id="tab-2-1-sprites">Sprites</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/2d/sprites.aed26d0c131764932c5b011cde056cc3c3f2b96383da5eacdfb7cd74890bc5ac.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/2d/sprites.aed26d0c131764932c5b011cde056cc3c3f2b96383da5eacdfb7cd74890bc5ac.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Mega Man X4 (1997).</figcaption></figure><p>In this case, the VDP1 is tasked with plotting traditional sprites without any 3D distortion applied.</p><p>The CPU sets up the VDP1 by writing over its registers and filling its VRAM with commands and tiles.

The Saturn, by contrast, allows defining 4-point quadrilaterals with arbitrary angles between their edges (Sega calls them ‘distorted sprites’). Then, the VDPs’ texture mapping capabilities paint the quadrilateral’s area with a texture, the latter is scaled to conform to the polygon’s shape.</p><p>In terms of operations needed with a 3D game, the CPUs and SCU are assigned to formulating a 3D world and project it in a 2D space.

This is because the format used to encode this model (glTF, an open standard for modern 3D modelling), so your modern device can render it, doesn’t support quadrangles at the time of this writing. So, I recommend switching to ‘Surface’ mode to observe the quads.</p><p>In some way, this tells you how the current graphics technology can struggle to reproduce their ~30-year-old predecessors!</p><h3 id="an-introduction-to-the-visibility-problem">An introduction to the visibility problem</h3><p>When 3D polygons are projected onto a 2D space, it is crucial to determine <strong>which polygons are visible from the camera’s position and which are hidden behind</strong> <sup id="bibref:11"><a href="#bib:graphics-vsd" role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></sup>. Otherwise, models are not drawn correctly, effects like transparency appear ‘broken’ and ultimately, hardware resources are wasted. This process is widely known as <strong>Visible surface determination</strong> or ‘VSD’ and it’s a fundamental problem in the world of computer graphics. There are multiple papers published that describe algorithms that tackle this at different stages of the graphics pipeline.

The VDP1 doesn’t implement any VSD function: You either feed the geometry in the correct order or you get a mess. However, Sega provided a graphics library called ‘SGL’ that implemented a solution called <strong>Z-sort</strong> or <strong>Painter’s algorithm</strong> <sup id="bibref:13"><a href="#bib:graphics-sgl" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></sup> which performs <strong>polygon sorting by software</strong>.</p><p>Essentially, SGL allocates a buffer to sort the polygons based on the distance from the camera (from furthest to nearest), then, issues the display commands to the VDP1 in that order.</p></div><p>One of the issues of Z-sort with 3D spaces is that its distance value (Z-order) is <strong>approximated</strong>, so graphic glitches may still appear. For this, programmers can skip SGL in favour of implementing their own algorithm.</p><p>In later articles, you will see alternative approaches. Some still rely on software, while others are accelerated by hardware.</p><h3 id="the-transparency-issue">The transparency issue</h3><p>The Sega Saturn is capable of drawing <strong>half-transparent graphics</strong>, in other words, mixing overlapping layers of colours (blending) to give the illusion we can see through them. Unfortunately, both VDPs aren’t as coordinated as one would expect, so this effect will not work properly when these layers are found in different VDPs.</p><p>As a workaround, games can activate the ‘mesh’ property on a texture. With ‘meshed’ textures, the VDP1 sets the odd X/Y texture coordinates as ‘transparent’ (empty). Making it possible to blend other layers using the transparent pixels. Curiously enough, the mesh would appear blurred if the console was connected to the TV using the composite video signal (which was pretty much the standard back then, aside from RF) resulting in an accidental but effective way to accomplish half-transparency <sup id="bibref:14"><a href="#bib:graphics-geer" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></sup>.</p><p>As you may suspect, this just wasn’t viable for some games, so in the end, these had no option but to ditch half-transparency altogether… Although some studios found ingenious fixes, take a look at these two cases:</p><figure><figure><video poster="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/video_posters/daytona.81b963bc475e2178039efcfbb2fc7e8f15b891473b7a95a856d04a810b97946c.jpg" preload="none" width="640" height="424" src="https://www.copetti.org/videos/consoles/saturn/daytona.2e198ac188497880d3e590e8389d6230e514612581212f9c8d56f973fb498ef9.mp4" controls="" controllist="nodownload">

Its medium, the compact disc (CD), has a capacity of <strong>680 MB</strong> and Sega Saturn games follow the <strong>ISO 9660</strong> standard for storing data <sup id="bibref:20"><a href="#bib:games-format" role="doc-biblioref">[20]</a></sup>. Additionally, many games store audio tracks next to the data tracks for streaming uncompressed audio while executing the game.</p><h3 id="the-compact-disc-cd">The Compact Disc (CD)</h3><p>The CD is an optical medium where information is stored by engraving <strong>pits</strong> and <strong>lands</strong> on its polycarbonate surface <sup id="bibref:21"><a href="#bib:cpu-optical" role="doc-biblioref">[21]</a></sup>. Then, an infrared light is beamed from the reader and the reflection produced on the CD’s surface is used to read the information back.</p><p>The process of converting digital information (ones and zeroes) into pits and lands and vice versa is not simple by any means, especially since CDs must be robust enough to sustain day-to-day damage and intensive use; and reliable enough to store any kind of information without fear of data loss. Hence, as part of its specification, data is encoded using the <strong>Non-Return-to-Zero inverted</strong> (NRZi) model, meaning that the bitstream will be all zeroes until a land-to-pit or pit-to-land change is detected, at which a <code>1</code> will be appended instead.</p><p>This design works well until the reader encounters a sequence of ones (continuous pit and land changes) or long sequences of zeroes (constant pits or lands), at which the sensor will struggle to detect or keep synchronised, respectively.

With this, a handful of zeroes are padded in-between the encodings, these help the sensor during the reading process.</p><p>On top of all this, further mechanisms of error detection may be added, although these are beyond the scope of this article.

Due to the use of the cartridge medium, Action Replay cartridges are often re-flashed with pseudosaturn (though the flasher also needs to be bootstrapped somehow, most commonly through the swap trick).<ul><li>This method is still being used as of 2022, although a new fork of pseudosaturn named ‘Pseudo Saturn Kai’ is installed instead.</li></ul></li><li>Another method was reported in 2016 (almost 20 years later) by exploiting the fact that the <strong>Video CD add-on can inject unencrypted code</strong> to the CD subsystem (bypassing the CD reader altogether). This finally allowed users to load Homebrew independently of the ageing drive. The Video CD exploit is commercially distributed in a product called ‘Satiator’ (I’m not sponsored, by the way).</li><li>Finally, there’s another commercial alternative that replaces the CD reader with an SD or SATA adapter. The Saturn still thinks it’s reading from a CD, but the ‘CD’ is being emulated by the adapter, which is in turn reading from a disc image <sup id="bibref:25"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-ode" role="doc-biblioref">[25]</a></sup>. These products are called <strong>Optical Drive Emulators</strong> (ODE).</li></ul><hr/><h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s all folks</h2><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/mine.e96ef88708e597771584d2cdab33134986934020e7863ce6293b17d999d16ae0.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/_hu42db0004e070320862ad06f7d95006f4_128861_0881f77d5a3134ba6187a6473d340b74.webp 500w,
