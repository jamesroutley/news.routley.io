          <p>I <b>love</b> dotfiles.</p>

<p>
  “Dotfiles” is a term that refers to configuration files used to configure
  software and operating systems. They are called such because often these files
  start with a dot. You may have seen
  <code>.bashrc</code>,
  <code>.tmux.conf</code> or
  <code>.zshrc</code> in the wild.
</p>

<p>
  Whenever a software doesn’t offer direct file-based configuration, I feel sad
  because it means I need to take extra steps to keep my configuration across
  different devices in sync or when setting up a new machine.
</p>

<p>I <b>love</b> sharing.</p>

<p>
  I regularly publish ideas and experiences in
  <a href="https://hamatti.org/blog">my blog</a>, I share my notes in
  <a href="https://notes.hamatti.org/">my digital garden</a>
  and I publish almost all the code I write (outside work) as open source
  <a href="https://github.com/hamatti">in GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I <b>love</b> to read
  <a href="https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles&amp;type=repositories">other people’s dotfiles</a>
  and learn from them.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, somehow I feel like sharing my own dotfiles to the world is beyond my
  comfort zone. I feel my customisations and aliases and other decisions are too
  intimate and personal to share.
</p>

<p>I don’t quite know why though.</p>

<p>
  I have a really cool repository where I keep my dotfiles and there’s quite a
  lot there. There’s the usual suspects like my
  <code>zsh</code> config and aliases, my
  <code>tmux</code> configuration and my
  <code>neovim</code> and
  <code>vscode</code> stuff too. And my
  <a href="https://hamatti.org/posts/bring-your-custom-toolkit-to-repl-sessions/">Python startup script</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I also keep my
  <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> core list
  there: that’s all the packages I want to always have at hand. Having them all
  in one place to be installed with a single command on a new computer is
  lovely.
</p>

<p>
  I also keep my
  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Stylus</a>
  CSS rules there so I can easily bring the experience I want on any browser I
  use.
</p>

<p>
  I use
  <a href="https://notes.hamatti.org/technology/recipes/manage-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow">GNU Stow to manage most of these</a>. For anything that’s directly applicable by copying the files into a given
  folder, I’ve set up the folder structure so that running
  <code>stow [folder]</code> will create symlinks to
  right places: any change made into the repository from any machine will apply
  to all machines. It’s so cool.
</p>

<p>
  All in all, my dotfiles repository is home to 19 configuration files +
  everything my neovim installation has, plugins and all.
</p>

<p>
  For now however, I
  <i>keep them secret, keep them safe </i>until I
  feel better about sharing my dotfiles with the world.
