<p>Earlier today I spoke as a panellist at WorldCon (DisCon III), in <a href="https://discon3.org/session/poverty-and-wealth-inequality-in-science-fiction/">the virtual session &#34;Poverty and Wealth Inequality in Science Fiction.&#34;</a> (I was a late addition.) I shared several links so I figured I&#39;d reblog them here.</p><p>I&#39;m Sumana (she/her) and I&#39;m a scifi fan who works in the technology industry. I live in New York City and I&#39;m from the US. I co-edited <a href="http://thoughtcrime.crummy.com/">a scifi/fantasy anthology</a> several years ago that you can read for free online. <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/activity/98835/posts/mefi/">I have also been recommending one story a day on MetaFilter.com for some time now</a>.</p><p>In case you&#39;re bored with the same old dystopian premises, try my web toy <a href="https://www.brainwane.net/dystopia/">Randomized Dystopia</a>.</p><p>I really appreciated what Jason Sanford said about <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/genre-grapevine-57719744">the difficulty of doing international payments as part of the forces against equality in SF/F</a>.</p><p>I read far more short stories/novellas than I do novels. Upon considering the panel topic I was reminded of a few recent stories. In all of them we take the point of view of workers or the underclass affected by the oppressive decisions of wealthy elites -- named and unnamed, seen and unseen, capitalist and not. (Warning for spoilers in some of my descriptions below.)</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-decameron-37158539">&#34;The Last of the Redmond Billionaires&#34; by Peter Watts (2020)</a> is a very dark vignette in a climate refugee future, wherein we barely see the oligarch and we focus on the rage -- eventually violent -- of those the oligarchs abandoned.</li><li><a href="http://compellingsciencefiction.com/stories/the-stillness-of-the-stars.html">&#34;The Stillness of the Stars&#34; by Jessica Snell (formerly McAdams) (2020)</a> is a space thriller on a generation ship, in the far future. Elites (one of whom we meet) have betrayed a bargain with workers by secretly indefinitely deferring the date on which they&#39;ll lower the steerage-class wall and let workers into the paradise they&#39;ve found.</li><li><a href="https://escapepod.org/2021/08/05/escape-pod-796-one-hundred-seconds-to-midnight/">&#34;One Hundred Seconds to Midnight&#34; by Lauren Ring (2021)</a> is set in an alternate present and uses the POV of an insurance company worker who gets trapped by a kaiju attack, and who reflects on how little their company values them and other workers, as shown in tiny insurance payouts.</li><li><a href="https://reckoning.press/thank-you-for-your-patience/">&#34;Thank You For Your Patience&#34; by Rebecca Campbell (2020)</a> is set about ten minutes into the future; a worker is stuck doing tech support while the world slow-motion falls apart outside thanks to natural disasters; he is physically and virtually isolated from all sources of information and connection because of decrees from above.</li></ol><p>A few places and ways short sf/f sometimes has a more ambivalent reaction to wealth inequality or suggests a more complicated attitude:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.kith.org/jed/2021/11/24/several-responses-to-omelas/">recent bunch of stories responding to Le Guin&#39;s &#34;The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas&#34;</a> -- especially those that suggest that the middle class is also complicit in that child&#39;s suffering.</li><li>Stories about aristocrats -- often historical period pieces -- that deploy the pleasures of stately mansions, fancy clothes, etc.</li><li>Batman and Iron Man fiction and fan fiction -- this played out, for instance, in <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/192847/The-Computronic-Program-o-Mat-was-deeply-unpopular">this comment thread</a> about whether the wildest fantasy of Batman is that a rich man is good.</li></ul><p>Closing recommendations from me: <b>Walkaway</b> by Cory Doctorow, and <b>China Mountain Zhang</b> by Maureen McHugh.</p><p>I&#39;m @brainwane on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@brainwane/">Mastodon.social</a> and on <a href="https://twitter.com/brainwane/">Twitter</a>, and my blog is here at <a href="http://harihareswara.net/">https://harihareswara.net</a>.</p><p>Oh, and I meant to mention <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/17722736">the fanvid &#34;Dance Apocalyptic&#34;</a> which collages together a lot of film, TV, and more to illustrate stories of inequality and revolt.</p><p>Thanks to Worldcon for having me, thanks to the volunteers who supported the session, and thanks to Olav Rokne for moderating!</p>
