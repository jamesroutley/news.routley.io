<h3 id="history-so-far">History so far</h3>
<p>Pocket Casts, people are not upset you are trying to find revenue sources. People are upset you are reneging on your promise.</p>
<p>You were a pay-once app. Released in 2011, pay once each for Android, iOS, and Web and keep for life.</p>
<p>In 2018 NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/607823388/pocket-cast-acquired?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">acquired you</a>.  Then in 2019 you moved to a subscription for all users, including the paid ones. People were upset so you backtracked and <a href="https://blog.pocketcasts.com/2019/09/18/major-new-update/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">grandfathered them into</a> a lifetime plus membership. Sadly, in 2020 NPR lost <a href="https://current.org/2021/01/public-media-owners-agree-to-sell-pocket-casts-podcast-platform/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">$800k from running you</a> so you were <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/07/16/popular-podcast-app-pocket-casts-joins-automattic/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">sold to Automattic</a>.</p>
<p>In 2024, you renamed all &#34;Pocket Casts Lifetime Members&#34; to <a href="https://support.pocketcasts.com/knowledge-base/lifetime-access-to-pocket-casts-plus/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">&#34;Pocket Casts Champions&#34;</a> and we knew shenanigans were afoot.</p>
<p>This week you flipped the switch to turn on ads in the app:</p>
<p>However, in 2022 you <a href="https://blog.pocketcasts.com/2022/10/19/pocket-casts-mobile-apps-are-now-open-source/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">made your mobile apps open source</a>, so there is something that can be done: I <a href="https://github.com/ciferkey/pocket-casts-android?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">forked</a> the repo.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="exorcising-the-ads">Exorcising the ads</h3>
<p>In the app you may be able to see the new nag that says: &#34;Unlock folders, bookmarks, transcripts and more with Pocket Casts Plus&#34; just above the artwork in the player screen. I don&#39;t see that exact string in the <a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/podcasts-you-altered-the-deal-so-i-will-alter-your-app/github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android">GitHub repo</a>, I think that&#39;s because of internationalization.</p>
<p>However, I found where the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android/blob/f17d2a0408dd299684eb4afa11fb07f4df1fc59e/modules/features/player/src/main/java/au/com/shiftyjelly/pocketcasts/player/view/PlayerHeaderFragment.kt?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com#L99">artwork view fragment is</a> and that it contains <code>AdAndArtworkHorizontal</code>. Looking at the changelog I can see that this was added in <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android/pull/4086?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">Display ads in the player #4086</a> which created the flag <code>Feature.BANNER_ADS</code>.</p>
<p>In the project, a feature flag has the following details:</p>
<pre><code>enum class Feature(  
    val key: String,  
    val title: String,  
    val defaultValue: Boolean,  
    val tier: FeatureTier,  
    val hasFirebaseRemoteFlag: Boolean,  
    val hasDevToggle: Boolean,  
)
</code></pre>
<p>With some further updates to the project, the flag is now <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android/blob/f17d2a0408dd299684eb4afa11fb07f4df1fc59e/modules/services/utils/src/main/java/au/com/shiftyjelly/pocketcasts/utils/featureflag/Feature.kt?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com#L125-L140">broken in two</a>:</p>
<pre><code>BANNER_ADS_PLAYER(  
    key = &#34;banner_ad_player&#34;,  
    title = &#34;Banner Ads Player&#34;,  
    defaultValue = true,  
    tier = FeatureTier.Free,  
    hasFirebaseRemoteFlag = true,  
    hasDevToggle = true,  
),  
BANNER_ADS_PODCASTS(  
    key = &#34;banner_ad_podcasts&#34;,  
    title = &#34;Banner Ads Podcasts&#34;,  
    defaultValue = true,  
    tier = FeatureTier.Free,  
    hasFirebaseRemoteFlag = true,  
    hasDevToggle = true,  
),
</code></pre>
<p>The flags are ultimately used by <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android/blob/f17d2a0408dd299684eb4afa11fb07f4df1fc59e/modules/services/model/src/main/java/au/com/shiftyjelly/pocketcasts/models/type/BlazeAdLocation.kt?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com#L11">BlazeAdLocation</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different ways we could slice out the ads. For testing, I went with the simplest approach to start:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flip <code>defaultValue</code> to false.</li>
<li>Flip <code>hasFirebaseRemoteFlag</code> to false so the flag will not be remotely overridden.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, based on the readme I just needed to<code>./gradlew :app:assembleDebugProd</code> and <code>./gradlew :app:installDebugProd</code>. This will install a different debug version of the app:</p>
<p>Voila, ads gone. Though in the future this process may be tougher because of Google&#39;s <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">impending crackdown on loading APKs</a>.</p>
<p>Now, after doing all that work, guess what I realized? <code>hasDevToggle</code> field in the Features class? Well the debug build has a feature toggles section:</p>
<p>So for now you do not need to modify the project&#39;s code. You can get by with just using the debug build and toggling the feature off. Feature flags only exist for testing features though. Eventually the flag will go away and I&#39;ll have to disable the ads more directly.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-we-end-up-here">Why did we end up here?</h3>
<p>Pocket Casts, your current approach to monetization seems extreme. Are you in a similar situation to 2020? Back then the NPR <a href="https://media.npr.org/documents/about/statements/fy2020/National%20Public%20Radio%20-%20Consolidated%20Financial%20Statements%202020.pdf?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">financial report</a> only had a single line item of $812,129 for &#34;Minus: Share of Podcast Mediaâ€™s net loss&#34;. Why does a podcast service cost so much to run? If you give us more transparency, maybe we will better understand why you need to make changes.</p>
<p>Maybe more of the work can be moved on-device. You open-sourced your app. Maybe the community can help you out and contribute those changes? We&#39;re not too scary. You extended an olive branch by open-sourcing the project, so let&#39;s work together. Hopefully Automattic doesn&#39;t pull back on contributions like they <a href="https://automattic.com/2025/01/09/aligning-automattics-sponsored-contributions-to-wordpress/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">did with WordPress this year</a>.</p>

<h3 id="an-entirely-different-option">An entirely different option</h3>
<p>As I mentioned in my post about <a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/the-apps-that-i-kept-on-grapheneos-2/#the-media-apps">the apps I kept when switching to GrapheneOS</a>,  self-hosting PinePods and using AntennaPod on your phone is a great option! That way you can still have web and desktop sync. I also said in that post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I wasn&#39;t grandfathered into the free premium tier I would be more tempted to jump ship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The time to jump ship seems to be getting closer. I think Pocket Casts will join a future version of my <a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/the-apps-that-i-got-rid-of-when-trying-out-grapheneos/">apps that I got rid of when switching to GrapheneOS</a> post.</p>
<p>Oh, and if anyone is looking for new podcasts to listen to, <a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/what-podcasts-am-i-listening-to-2025/">I have recommendations</a>.</p>
