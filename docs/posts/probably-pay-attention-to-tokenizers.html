        <p>Last week I was helping a friend of mine to get one of his new apps off the ground. I can’t speak much about it at the moment,
other than like most apps nowadays it has some AI sprinkled over it. Ok, maybe a bit maybe more just a bit – depends on
the way you look at it, I suppose.</p>
<p>There is a Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) hiding somewhere in most of the AI apps. RAG is still all the RAGe – it even has
its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation">Wikipedia page</a> now! I’m not sure if anyone is tracking
how fast a term reaches the point where it gets its own Wiki page but RAG must be somewhere near the top of the charts.</p>
<p>I find it quite intriguing that most of the successful AI apps are basically clever semantic search apps. Google search
got [somewhat] unbundled at last which kind of makes me think whether their not unleashing all the LLM tech way earlier
was behind all of this. But I digress.</p>
<p>The app my friend has been building for the past couple of weeks deals with a lot of e-commerce data: descriptions of different items,
invoices, reviews, etc. The problem he was facing was that the RAG wasn’t working particularly well for some queries, while it worked
very well for others.</p>
<p>One of the things I noticed over the past year is how a lot of developers who are used to developing in the traditional (deterministic)
space fail to change the way they should think about problems in the statistical space which is ultimately what LLM apps are.
Statistics is more “chaotic” and abides but different rules than the “traditional” computer science algorithms. Look, I get it,
it’s still maths, but it’s often a very different kind of maths.</p>
<p>What I usually see is folks thinking about LLMs as tools you can feed anything and get back gold but in reality when you do that
fyou usually encounter “Garbage In, Garbage Out” reality. Which was almost the case in the curious case the friend of mine was dealing with.</p>
<p>The first thing I do when dealing with these types of problems is getting myself familiar with the input data. You need to understand
those before you can do anything meaningful with it.</p>
