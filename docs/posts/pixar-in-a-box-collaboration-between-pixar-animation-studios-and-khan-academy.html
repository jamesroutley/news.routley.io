    <h1>Pixar in a Box: Collaboration Between Pixar Animation Studios and Khan Academy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt=""/></p><p>Pixar in a Box is a behind-the-scenes look at how Pixar artists do their jobs. You will be able to animate bouncing balls, build a swarm of robots, and make virtual fireworks explode. The subjects you learn in school — math, science, computer science, and humanities — are used every day to create amazing movies at Pixar. This collaboration between Pixar Animation Studios and Khan Academy is sponsored by Disney. If you have questions or ideas, email us at piab@khanacademy.org.</p></div></div></div>
