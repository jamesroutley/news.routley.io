<p><span>Since 2022, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has been tracking multiple cyber espionage operations conducted by China-nexus actors utilizing </span><strong>POISONPLUG.SHADOW</strong><span>. These operations employ a custom obfuscating compiler that we refer to as &#34;</span><strong>ScatterBrain</strong><span>,&#34; facilitating attacks against various entities across Europe and the Asia Pacific (APAC) region. ScatterBrain appears to be a substantial evolution of ScatterBee, an obfuscating compiler </span><a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/research/chasing-shadows.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>previously analyzed by PWC</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>GTIG assesses that POISONPLUG is an advanced modular backdoor used by multiple distinct, but likely related threat groups based in the PRC, however we assess that POISONPLUG.SHADOW usage appears to be further restricted to clusters associated with APT41.</span></p>
<p><span>GTIG currently tracks three known POISONPLUG variants:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>POISONPLUG</span></li>
<li><span>POISONPLUG.DEED</span></li>
<li><span>POISONPLUG.SHADOW</span></li>
</ul></span></section><section></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>POISONPLUG.SHADOW—often referred to as &#34;Shadowpad,&#34; a malware family name first introduced by Kaspersky—stands out due to its use of a custom obfuscating compiler specifically designed to evade detection and analysis. Its complexity is compounded by not only the extensive obfuscation mechanisms employed but also by the attackers&#39; highly sophisticated threat tactics. These elements collectively make analysis exceptionally challenging and complicate efforts to identify, understand, and mitigate the associated threats it poses.</span></p>
<p><span>In addressing these challenges, GTIG collaborates closely with the FLARE team to dissect and analyze POISONPLUG.SHADOW. This partnership utilizes state-of-the-art reverse engineering techniques and comprehensive threat intelligence capabilities required to mitigate the sophisticated threats posed by this threat actor. We remain dedicated to advancing methodologies and fostering innovation to adapt to and counteract the ever-evolving tactics of threat actors, ensuring the security of Google and our customers against sophisticated cyber espionage operations.</span></p>
<h2><span>Overview</span></h2>
<p><span>In this blog post, we present our in-depth analysis of the ScatterBrain obfuscator, which has led to the development of a <a href="https://github.com/mandiant/poisonplug-scatterbrain" rel="noopener" target="_blank">complete stand-alone static deobfuscator library</a> independent of any binary analysis frameworks. Our analysis is based solely on the obfuscated samples we have successfully recovered, as we do not possess the obfuscating compiler itself. Despite this limitation, we have been able to comprehensively infer every aspect of the obfuscator and the necessary requirements to break it. Our analysis further reveals that ScatterBrain is continuously evolving, with incremental changes identified over time, highlighting its ongoing development.</span></p>
<p><span>This publication begins by exploring the fundamental primitives of ScatterBrain, outlining all its components and the challenges they present for analysis. We then detail the steps required to subvert and remove each protection mechanism, culminating in our deobfuscator. Our library takes protected binaries generated by ScatterBrain as input and produces fully functional deobfuscated binaries as output.</span></p>
<p><span>By detailing the inner workings of ScatterBrain and sharing our deobfuscator, we hope to provide valuable insights into developing effective countermeasures. Our blog post is intentionally exhaustive, drawing from our experience in dealing with obfuscation for clients, where we observed a significant lack of clarity in understanding modern obfuscation techniques. Similarly, analysts often struggle with understanding even relatively simplistic obfuscation methods primarily because standard binary analysis tooling is not designed to account for them. Therefore, our goal is to alleviate this burden and help enhance the collective understanding against commonly seen protection mechanisms.</span></p>
<p><span><span>For general questions about obfuscating compilers, </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/lummac2-obfuscation-through-indirect-control-flow"><span>we refer to our previous work</span></a><span> on the topic, which provides an introduction and overview.</span></span></p>
<h2><span>ScatterBrain Obfuscator</span></h2>
<h3><span>Introduction</span></h3>
<p><span>ScatterBrain is a sophisticated obfuscating compiler that integrates multiple operational modes and protection components to significantly complicate the analysis of the binaries it generates. Designed to render modern binary analysis frameworks and defender tools ineffective, ScatterBrain disrupts both static and dynamic analyses.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protection Modes:</strong><span> ScatterBrain operates in three distinct modes, each determining the overall structure and intensity of the applied protections. These modes allow the compiler to adapt its obfuscation strategies based on the specific requirements of the attack.</span></li>
<li><strong>Protection Components: </strong><span>The compiler employs key protection components that include the following:</span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selective or Full Control Flow Graph (CFG) Obfuscation:</strong><span> This technique restructures the program&#39;s control flow, making it very difficult to analyze and create detection rules for.</span></li>
<li><strong>Instruction Mutations:</strong><span> ScatterBrain alters instructions to obscure their true functionality without changing the program&#39;s behavior.</span></li>
<li><strong>Complete Import Protection:</strong><span> ScatterBrain employs a complete protection of a binary&#39;s import table, making it extremely difficult to understand how the binary interacts with the underlying operating system.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>These protection mechanisms collectively make it extremely challenging for analysts to deconstruct and understand the functionality of the obfuscated binaries. As a result, ScatterBrain poses a formidable obstacle for cybersecurity professionals attempting to dissect and mitigate the threats it generates.</span></p>
<h3><span>Modes of Operation</span></h3>
<p><span>A mode refers to how ScatterBrain will transform a given binary into its obfuscated representation. It is distinct from the actual core obfuscation mechanisms themselves and is more about the overall strategy of applying protections. Our analysis further revealed a consistent pattern in applying various protection modes at specific stages of an attack chain:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selective: </strong><span>A group of individually selected functions are protected, leaving the remainder of the binary in its original state. Any import references within the selected functions are also obfuscated. This mode was observed to be used strictly for dropper samples of an attack chain.</span></li>
<li><strong>Complete: </strong><span>The entirety of the code section and all imports are protected. This mode was applied solely to the plugins embedded within the main backdoor payload.</span></li>
<li><strong>Complete &#34;headerless&#34;: </strong><span>This is an extension of the </span><strong>Complete</strong><span> mode with added data protections and the removal of the PE header. This mode was exclusively reserved for the final backdoor payload.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Selective</span></h4>
<p><span>The selective mode of protection allows users of the obfuscator to selectively target individual functions within the binary for protection. Protecting an individual function involves keeping the function at its original starting address (produced by the original compiler and linker) and substituting the first instruction with a jump to the obfuscated code. The generated obfuscations are stored linearly from this starting point up to a designated &#34;end marker&#34; that signifies the ending boundary of the applied protection. This entire range constitutes a protected function.</span></p>
<p><span>The disassembly of a call site to a protected function can take the following from:</span></p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><pre><code>.text:180001000 sub     rsp, 28h

<p><span>The complete mode protects every function within the </span><code>.text</code><span> section of the binary, with all protections integrated directly into a single code section. There are no end markers to signify protected regions; instead, every function is uniformly protected, ensuring comprehensive coverage without additional sectioning.</span></p>
<p><span>This mode forces the need for some kind of deobfuscation tooling. Whereas selective mode only protects the selected functions and leaves everything else in its original state, this mode makes the output binary extremely difficult to analyze without accounting for the obfuscation.</span></p>
<h4><span>Complete Headerless</span></h4>
<p><span>This complete mode extends the complete approach to add further data obfuscations alongside the code protections. It is the most comprehensive mode of protection and was observed to be exclusively limited to the final payloads of an attack chain. It incorporates the following properties:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Full PE header of the protected binary is removed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Custom loading logic (a loader) is introduced.</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Becomes the entry point of the protected binary</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Responsible of ensuring the protected binary is functional</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Includes the option of mapping the final payload within a separate memory region distinct from the initial memory region it was loaded in</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><span>Metadata is protected via hash-like integrity checks.</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The metadata is utilized by the loader as part of its initialization sequence.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><span>Import protection will require relocation adjustments.</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Done through an &#34;import fixup table&#34;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span>The loader’s entry routine crudely merges with the original entry of the binary by inserting multiple </span><code>jmp</code> <span>instructions to bridge the two together. The following is what the entry point looks like after running our deobfuscator against a binary protected in headerless mode.</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig4.max-1000x1000.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig4.max-1000x1000.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig4.max-1000x1000.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig4.max-1000x1000.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 4: Deobfuscated loader entry</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>The loader&#39;s metadata is stored in the </span><code>.data</code><span> section of the protected binary.

<h4><span>Instruction Dispatcher</span></h4>
<p><span>The </span><strong>instruction dispatcher</strong><span> is the central protection component that transforms the natural control flow of a binary (or individual function) into scattered basic blocks that end with a unique dispatcher routine that dynamically guides the execution of the protected binary.</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig7.max-1400x1400.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig7.max-1400x1400.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig7.max-1400x1400.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig7.max-1400x1400.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 7: Illustration of the control flow instruction dispatchers induce</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>Each call to a dispatcher is immediately followed by a 32-bit encoded displacement positioned at what would normally be the return address for the call. The dispatcher decodes this displacement to calculate the destination target for the next group of instructions to execute. A protected binary can easily contain thousands or even tens of thousands of these dispatchers making manual analysis of them practically infeasible. Additionally, the dynamic dispatching and decoding logic employed by each dispatcher effectively disrupts CFG reconstruction methods used by all binary analysis frameworks.</span></p>
<p><span>The decoding logic is unique for each dispatcher and is carried out using a combination of </span><code>add</code><span>, </span><code>sub</code><span>, </span><code>xor</code><span>, </span><code>and</code><span>, </span><code>or</code><span>, and </span><code>lea</code><span> instructions. The decoded offset value is then either subtracted from or added to the expected return address of the dispatcher call to determine the final destination address. This calculated address directs execution to the next block of instructions, which will similarly end with a dispatcher that uniquely decodes and jumps to subsequent instruction blocks, continuing this process iteratively to control the program flow.</span></p>
<p><span>The following screenshot illustrates what a dispatcher instance looks like when constructed in IDA Pro. Notice the scattered addresses present even within instruction dispatchers, which result from the obfuscator transforming fallthrough instructions—instructions that naturally follow the preceding instruction—into pairs of conditional branches that use opposite conditions. This ensures that one branch is always taken, effectively creating an unconditional jump. Additionally, a </span><code>mov</code><span> instruction that functions as a no-op is inserted to split these branches, further obscuring the control flow.</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig8.max-1200x1200.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig8.max-1200x1200.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig8.max-1200x1200.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig8.max-1200x1200.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 8: Example of an instruction dispatcher and all of its components</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>The core logic for any dispatcher can be categorized into the following four phases:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Preservation of Execution Context</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Each dispatcher selects a single working register (e.g., </span><code>RSI</code><span> as depicted in the screenshot) during the obfuscation process. This register is used in conjunction with the stack to carry out the intended decoding operations and dispatch. </span></li>
<li><span>The </span><code>RFLAGS</code><span> register in turn is safeguarded by employing </span><code>pushfq</code><span> and </span><code>popfq</code><span> instructions before carrying out the decoding sequence.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Retrieval of Encoded Displacement</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Each dispatcher retrieves a 32-bit encoded displacement located at the return address of its corresponding call instruction. This encoded displacement serves as the basis for determining the next destination address.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decoding Sequence</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Each dispatcher employs a unique decoding sequence composed of the following arithmetic and logical instructions: </span><code>xor</code><span>, </span><code>sub</code><span>, </span><code>add</code><span>, </span><code>mul</code><span>, </span><code>imul</code><span>, </span><code>div</code><span>, </span><code>idiv</code><span>, </span><code>and</code><span>, </span><code>or</code><span>, and </span><code>not</code><span>. This variability ensures that no two dispatchers operate identically, significantly increasing the complexity of the control flow.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Termination and Dispatch</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>The </span><code>ret</code><span> instruction is strategically used to simultaneously signal the end of the dispatcher function and redirect the program&#39;s control flow to the previously calculated destination address.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It is reasonable to infer that the obfuscator utilizes a template similar to the one illustrated in Figure 9 when applying its transformations to the original binary:</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig9.max-1300x1300.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig9.max-1300x1300.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig9.max-1300x1300.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig9.max-1300x1300.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 9: Instruction dispatcher template</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><h3><span>Opaque Predicates</span></h3>
<p><span>ScatterBrain uses a series of seemingly trivial opaque predicates (OP) that appear straightforward to analysts but significantly challenge contemporary binary analysis frameworks, especially when used collectively. These opaque predicates effectively disrupt static CFG recovery techniques not specifically designed to counter their logic. Additionally, they complicate symbolic execution approaches as well by inducing path explosions and hindering path prioritization. In the following sections, we will showcase a few examples produced by ScatterBrain.</span></p>
<h5><code>test</code> OP</h5>
<p><span>This opaque predicate is constructed around the behavior of the </span><code>test</code> <span>instruction when paired with an immediate zero value.

<p><span>The opaque predicate is designed to statically obscure the original immediate branch targets for conditional branch (</span><code>jcc</code><span>) instructions. Consider the following examples:</span></p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><pre><code>test    eax, eax

ja      loc_2D154 

test    r13, r13
jns     loc_3EA84
jns     loc_53AD9

test    eax, eax
jnz     loc_99C5
jnz     loc_121EC

cmp     eax, FFFFFFFF
jz      loc_273EE

<p><span>Figure 11: jcc opaque predicate examples</span></p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>The implementation is straightforward: each original </span><code>jcc</code> <span>instruction is duplicated with a bogus branch target. Since both </span><code>jcc</code> <span>instructions are functionally identical except for their respective branch destinations, we can determine with certainty that the first </span><code>jcc</code> <span>in each pair is the original instruction. This original </span><code>jcc</code> <span>dictates the correct branch target to follow when the respective condition is met, while the duplicated </span><code>jcc</code> <span>serves to confuse analysis tools by introducing misleading branch paths.</span></p>
<h5><span>Stack-Based OP</span></h5>
<p><span>The stack-based opaque predicate is designed to check whether the current stack pointer (</span><code>rsp</code><span>) is below a predetermined immediate threshold—a condition that can never be true. It is consistently implemented by pairing the </span><code>cmp rsp</code><span> instruction with a </span><code>jb</code><span> (jump if below) condition immediately afterward.</span></p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><pre><code>cmp rsp, 0x8d6e

<h4><span>Import Protection</span></h4>
<p><span>The obfuscator implements a sophisticated import protection layer. This mechanism conceals the binary &#39;s dependencies by transforming each original </span><code>call</code> <span>or </span><code>jmp</code> <span>instruction directed at an import through a unique stub dispatcher routine that knows how to dynamically resolve and invoke the import in question.</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig13.max-1700x1700.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig13.max-1700x1700.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig13.max-1700x1700.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig13.max-1700x1700.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 13: Illustration of all the components involved in the import protection</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>It consists of the following components:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Import-specific encrypted</strong><span> </span><strong>data:</strong><span> Each protected import is represented by a unique dispatcher stub and a scattered data structure that stores RVAs to both the encrypted dynamic-link library (DLL) and application programming interface (API) names. We refer to this structure as </span><code>obf_imp_t</code><span>. Each dispatcher stub is hardcoded with a reference to its respective </span><code>obf_imp_t</code><span>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dispatcher stub:</strong><span> This is an obfuscated stub that dynamically resolves and invokes the intended import. While every stub shares an identical template, each contains a unique hardcoded RVA that identifies and locates its corresponding </span><code>obf_imp_t</code><span>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resolver routine:</strong><span> Called from the dispatcher stub, this obfuscated routine resolves the import and returns it to the dispatcher, which facilitates the final call to the intended import. It begins by locating the encrypted DLL and API names based on the information in </span><code>obf_imp_t</code><span>. After decrypting these names, the routine uses them to resolve the memory address of the API.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Import decryption routine:</strong><span> Called from the resolver routine, this obfuscated routine is responsible for decrypting the DLL and API name blobs through a custom stream cipher implementation. It uses a hardcoded 32-bit salt that is unique per protected sample.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fixup Table:</strong><span> Present only in headerless mode, this is a relocation fixup table that the loader in headerless mode uses to correct all memory displacements to the following import protection components:</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Encrypted DLL names</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Encrypted API names</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Import dispatcher references</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h5><span>Dispatcher Stub</span></h5>
<p><span>The core of the import protection mechanism is the </span><strong>dispatcher stub</strong><span>. Each stub is tailored to an individual import and consistently employs a </span><code>lea</code> <span>instruction to access its respective </span><code>obf_imp_t</code><span>, which it passes as the only input to the resolver routine.</span></p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><pre><code>push rcx                  ; save RCX

<p><span>The import decryption logic is implemented using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm to generate a pseudo-random key stream, which is then used in a XOR-based stream cipher for decryption. It operates on the following formula:</span></p>
<p><span>X</span><sub><span>n</span></sub><span> + 1 = (a • </span><span>X</span><sub><span>n</span></sub><span><span> </span></span><span>+ c) mod </span><span>2</span><sup><span>32</span></sup></p>
<p><span>where:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>a</code> <span>is always hardcoded to </span><code>17</code> <span>and functions as the multiplier</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>c</code> <span>is a unique 32-bit constant determined by the encryption context and is unique per-protected sample</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>We refer to it as the </span><code>imp_decrypt_const</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><code>mod</code><span> 2<sup>32</sup> confines the sequence values to a 32-bit range</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The decryption logic initializes with a value from the encrypted data and iteratively generates new values using the outlined LCG formula. Each iteration produces a byte derived from the calculated value, which is then XOR&#39;ed with the corresponding encrypted byte. This process continues byte-by-byte until it reaches a termination condition.</span></p>
<p><span>A fully recovered Python implementation for the decryption logic is provided in Figure 18.</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig18.max-1300x1300.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig18.max-1300x1300.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig18.max-1300x1300.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig18.max-1300x1300.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 18: Complete Python implementation of the import string decryption routine</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><h5><span>Import Fixup Table</span></h5>

<p><span>Effective recovery from an obfuscated binary necessitates a thorough understanding of the protection mechanisms employed. While deobfuscation often benefits from working with an intermediate representation (IR) rather than the raw disassembly—an IR provides more granular control in undoing transformations—this obfuscator preserves the original compiled code, merely enveloping it with additional protection layers. Given this context, our deobfuscation strategy focuses on stripping away the obfuscator&#39;s transformations from the disassembly to reveal the original instructions and data. This is achieved through a series of hierarchical phases, where each subsequent phase builds upon the previous one to ensure comprehensive deobfuscation.</span></p>
<p><span>We categorize this approach into three distinct categories that we eventually integrate:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>CFG Recovery</strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Restoring the natural control flow by removing obfuscation artifacts at the instruction and  basic block levels. This involves two phases:</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Accounting for instruction dispatchers:</strong><span> Addressing the core of control flow protection that obscure the execution flow</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Function identification and</strong><span> </span><strong>recovery: </strong><span>Cataloging scattered instructions and reassembling them into their original function counterparts</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Import Recovery</strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Original Import Table:</strong><span> The goal is to reconstruct the original import table, ensuring that all necessary library and function references are accurately restored.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Binary Rewriting</strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Generating Deobfuscated Executables:</strong><span> This process entails creating a new, deobfuscated executable that maintains the original functionality while removing ScatterBrain&#39;s modifications.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<h3><span>CFG Recovery</span></h3>
<p><span>The primary obstacle disrupting the natural control flow graph is the use of </span><strong>instruction dispatchers</strong><span>. Eliminating these dispatchers is our first priority in obtaining the CFG. Afterward, we need to reorganize the scattered instructions back into their original function representations—a problem known as function identification, which is notoriously difficult to generalize. Therefore, we approach it using our specific knowledge about the obfuscator.</span></p>
<p><strong>Linearizing the Scattered CFG</strong></p>
<p><span>Our initial step in recovering the original CFG is to eliminate the scattering effect induced by instruction dispatchers. We will transform all dispatcher call instructions into direct branches to their resolved targets. This transformation linearizes the execution flow, making it straightforward to statically pursue the second phase of our CFG recovery. This will be implemented via brute-force scanning, static parsing, emulation, and instruction patching.</span></p>
<p><strong>Function Identification and Recovery</strong></p>
<p><span>We leverage a recursive descent algorithm that employs a depth-first search (DFS) strategy applied to known entry points of code, attempting to exhaust all code paths by &#34;single-stepping&#34; one instruction at a time. We add additional logic to the processing of each instruction in the form of &#34;mutation rules&#34; that stipulate how each individual instruction needs to be processed. These rules aid in stripping away the obfuscator&#39;s code from the original.</span></p>
<h4><span>Removing Instruction Dispatchers</span></h4>
<p><span>Eliminating instruction dispatchers involves identifying each dispatcher location and its corresponding dispatch target. Recall that the target is a uniquely encoded 32-bit displacement located at the return address of the dispatcher call. To remove instruction dispatchers, it is essential to first understand how to accurately identify them. We begin by categorizing the defining properties of individual instruction dispatchers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Target of a Near Call</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Dispatchers are always the destination of a near </span><code>call</code><span> instruction, represented by the </span><code>E8</code><span> opcode followed by a 32-bit displacement.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>References Encoded 32-Bit Displacement at Return Address</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Dispatchers reference the encoded 32-bit displacement located at the return address on the stack by performing a 32-bit read from the stack pointer. This displacement is essential for determining the next execution target.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pairing of </strong><code>pushfq</code><span> </span><strong>and </strong><code>popfq</code><span> </span><strong>Instructions to Safeguard Decoding</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Dispatchers use a pair of </span><code>pushfq</code><span> and </span><code>popfq</code><span> instructions to preserve the state of the </span><code>RFLAGS</code><span> register during the decoding process. This ensures that the dispatcher does not alter the original execution context, maintaining the integrity of register contents.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>End with a</strong><span> </span><code>ret</code> <strong>Instruction</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Each dispatcher concludes with a </span><code>ret</code><span> instruction, which not only ends the dispatcher function but also redirects control to the next set of instructions, effectively continuing the execution flow.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Leveraging the aforementioned categorizations, we implement the following approach to identify and remove instruction dispatchers:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Brute-Force Scanner for Near Call Locations</strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Develop a scanner that searches for all near </span><code>call</code><span> instructions within the code section of the protected binary. This scanner generates a huge array of potential call locations that may serve as dispatchers.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Implementation of a Fingerprint Routine</strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The brute-force scan yields a large number of false positives, requiring an efficient method to filter them. While emulation can filter out false positives, it is computationally expensive to do it for the brute-force results.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Introduce a shallow fingerprinting routine that traverses the disassembly of each candidate to identify key dispatcher characteristics, such as the presence of </span><code>pushfq</code><span> and </span><code>popfq</code><span> sequences. This significantly improves performance by eliminating most false positives before concretely verifying them through emulation.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Emulation of Targets to Recover Destinations</strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Emulate execution starting from each verified call site to accurately recover the actual dispatch targets. Emulating from the call site ensures that the emulator processes the encoded offset data at the return address, abstracting away the specific decoding logic employed by each dispatcher.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>A successful emulation also serves as the final verification step to confirm that we have identified a dispatcher.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Identification of Dispatch Targets via </strong><strong>ret</strong><strong> Instructions</strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Utilize the terminating </span><code>ret</code><span> instruction to accurately identify the dispatch target within the binary.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The </span><code>ret</code><span> instruction is a definitive marker indicating the end of a dispatcher function and the point at which control is redirected, making it a reliable indicator for target identification.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h5><span>Brute-Force Scanner</span></h5>
<p><span>The following Python code implements the brute-force scanner, which performs a comprehensive byte signature scan within the code segment of a protected binary. The scanner systematically identifies all potential </span><code>call</code> <span>instruction locations by scanning for the </span><code>0xE8</code><span> opcode associated with near </span><code>call</code><span> instructions. The identified addresses are then stored for subsequent analysis and verification.</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig22.max-1100x1100.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig22.max-1100x1100.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig22.max-1100x1100.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig22.max-1100x1100.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 22: Python implementation of the brute-force scanner</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><h5><span>Fingerprinting Dispatchers</span></h5>
<p><span>The fingerprinting routine leverages the unique characteristics of instruction dispatchers, as detailed in the Instruction Dispatchers section, to statically identify potential dispatcher locations within a protected binary. This identification process utilizes the results from the prior brute-force scan. For each address in this array, the routine disassembles the code and examines the resulting disassembly listing to determine if it matches known dispatcher signatures.</span></p>
<p><span>This method is not intended to guarantee 100% accuracy, but rather serve as a cost-effective approach to identifying call locations with a high likelihood of being instruction dispatchers. Subsequent emulation will be employed to confirm these identifications.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Successful Decoding of a </strong><code>call</code><span> </span><strong>Instruction</strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The identified location must successfully decode to a </span><code>call</code><span> instruction. Dispatchers are always invoked via a </span><code>call</code><span> instruction. Additionally, dispatchers utilize the return address from the call site to locate their encoded 32-bit displacement.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Absence of Subsequent </strong><code>call</code><span> </span><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Dispatchers must not contain any </span><code>call</code><span> instructions within their disassembly listing. The presence of any </span><code>call</code><span> instructions within a presumed dispatcher range immediately disqualifies the call location as a dispatcher candidate.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Absence of Privileged Instructions and Indirect Control Transfers</strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Similarly to </span><code>call</code><span> instructions, the dispatcher cannot include privileged instructions or indirect unconditional </span><code>jmps</code><span>. Any presence of any such instructions invalidates the call location.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Detection of </strong><code>pushfq</code><span> </span><strong>and </strong><code>popfq</code><span> </span><strong>Guard Sequences</strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The dispatcher must contain </span><code>pushfq</code><span> and </span><code>popfq</code><span> instructions to safeguard the </span><code>RFLAGS</code><span> register during decoding. These sequences are unique to dispatchers and suffice for a generic identification without worrying about the differences that arise between how the decoding takes place.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Initialization of the Emulator</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Creates the core engine for simulating execution (</span><code>EmulateIntel64</code><span>), maps the protected binary image (</span><code>imgbuffer</code><span>) into the emulator&#39;s memory space, maps the Thread Environment Block (TEB) as well to simulate a realistic Windows execution environment, and creates an initial snapshot to facilitate fast resets before each emulation run without needing to reinitialize the entire emulator each time.</span></li>
<li><code>MAX_DISPATCHER_RANGE</code><span> specifies the maximum number of instructions to emulate for each dispatcher. The value 45 is chosen arbitrarily, sufficient given the limited instruction count in dispatchers even with the added mutations.</span></li>
<li><span>A </span><code>try</code><span>/</span><code>except</code><span> block is used to handle any exceptions during emulation. It is assumed that exceptions result from false positives among the potential dispatchers identified earlier and can be safely ignored.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Emulating Each Potential Dispatcher</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>For each potential dispatcher address (</span><code>call_dispatch_ea</code><span>), the emulator&#39;s context is restored to the initial snapshot. The program counter (</span><code>emu.pc</code><span>) is set to the address of each dispatcher. </span><code>emu.stepi()</code><span> executes one instruction at the current program counter, after which the instruction is analyzed to determine whether we have finished.</span>
<ul>
<li><span>If the instruction is a </span><code>ret</code><span>, the emulation has reached the dispatch point.</span></li>
<li><span>The dispatch target address is read from the stack using </span><code>emu.parse_u64(emu.rsp)</code><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>The results are captured by </span><code>d.dispatchers_to_target</code><span>, which maps the dispatcher address to the dispatch target. The dispatcher address is additionally stored in the </span><code>d.dispatcher_locs</code><span> lookup cache.</span>
<ul>
<li><span>The </span><code>break</code><span> statement exits the inner loop, proceeding to the next dispatcher.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><span>Patching and Linearization</span></h5>
<p><span>After collecting and verifying every captured instruction dispatcher, the final step is to replace each call location with a direct branch to its respective destination target.

<p><span>This removal is pivotal to our deobfuscation strategy as it removes the intended dynamic dispatch element that instruction dispatchers were designed to provide.

<p><span>By eliminating the effects of instruction dispatchers, we have linearized the execution flow. The next step involves assimilating the dispersed code and leveraging the linearized control flow to reconstruct the original functions that comprised the unprotected binary. This recovery phase involves several stages, including raw instruction recovery, normalization, and the construction of the final CFG.</span></p>
<p><span>Function identification and recovery is encapsulated in the following two abstractions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Recovered instruction</strong><span> (</span><code>RecoveredInstr</code><span>): The fundamental unit for representing individual instructions recovered from an obfuscated binary. Each instance encapsulates not only the raw instruction data but also metadata essential for relocation, normalization, and analysis within the CFG recovery process.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recovered function</strong><span> (</span><code>RecoveredFunc</code><span>): The end result of successfully recovering an individual function from an obfuscated binary. It aggregates multiple </span><code>RecoveredInstr</code><span> instances, representing the sequence of instructions that constitute the unprotected function. The complete CFG recovery process results in an array of </span><code>RecoveredFunc</code><span> instances, each corresponding to a distinct function within the binary. We will utilize these results in the final Building Relocations in Deobfuscated Binaries section to produce fully deobfuscated binaries.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>We do not utilize a basic block abstraction for our recovery approach given the following reasons. Properly abstracting basic blocks presupposes complete CFG recovery, which introduces unnecessary complexity and overhead for our purposes. Instead, it is simpler and more efficient to conceptualize a function as an aggregation of individual instructions rather than a collection of basic blocks in this particular deobfuscation context.</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig27.max-1200x1200.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig27.max-1200x1200.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig27.max-1200x1200.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig27.max-1200x1200.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 27: RecoveredInstr type definition</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig28.max-1200x1200.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig28.max-1200x1200.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig28.max-1200x1200.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig28.max-1200x1200.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 28: RecoveredFunc type definition</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><h5><span>DFS Rule-Guided Stepping Introduction</span></h5>
<p><span>We opted for a recursive-depth algorithm given the following reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural fit for code traversal:</strong><span> DFS allows us to infer function boundaries based solely on the flow of execution. It mirrors the way functions call other functions, making it intuitive to implement and reason about when reconstructing function boundaries. It also simplifies following the flow of loops and conditional branches.</span></li>
<li><strong>Guaranteed execution paths: </strong><span>We concentrate on code that is definitely executed. Given we have at least one known entry point into the obfuscated code, we know execution must pass through it in order to reach other parts of the code. While other parts of the code may be more indirectly invoked, this entry point serves as a foundational starting point.</span>
<ul>
<li>By recursively exploring from this known entry, we will almost certainly encounter and identify virtually all code paths and functions during our traversal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Adapts to instruction mutations:</strong><span> We tailor the logic of the traversal with callbacks or &#34;rules&#34; that stipulate how we process each individual instruction. This helps us account for known instruction mutations and aids in stripping away the obfuscator&#39;s code.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The core data structures involved in this process are the following: </span><code>CFGResult</code><span>, </span><code>CFGStepState</code><span>, </span><span>and </span><code>RuleHandler</code><span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><code>CFGResult</code><span>: Container for the results of the CFG recovery process. It aggregates all pertinent information required to represent the CFG of a function within the binary, which it primarily consumes from </span><code>CFGStepState</code><span>.</span></li>
<li><code>CFGStepState</code><span>: Maintains the state throughout the CFG recovery process, particularly during the controlled-step traversal. It encapsulates all necessary information to manage the traversal state, track progress, and store intermediate results.</span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recovered cache:</strong><span> Stores instructions that have been recovered for a protected function without any additional cleanup or verification. This initial collection is essential for preserving the raw state of the instructions as they exist within the obfuscated binary before any normalization or validation processes are applied after. It is always the first pass of recovery.</span></li>
<li><strong>Normalized cache:</strong><span> The final pass in the CFG recovery process. It transforms the raw instructions stored in the recovered cache into a fully normalized CFG by removing all obfuscator-introduced instructions and ensuring the creation of valid, coherent functions.</span></li>
<li><strong>Exploration stack:</strong><span> Manages the set of instruction addresses that are pending exploration during the DFS traversal for a protected function. It determines the order in which instructions are processed and utilizes a </span><code>visited</code><span> set to ensure that each instruction is processed only once.</span></li>
<li><strong>Obfuscator backbone:</strong><span> A mapping to preserve essential control flow links introduced by the obfuscator</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>RuleHandler</code><span>: </span><span>Mutation rules are merely callbacks that adhere to a specific function signature and are invoked during each instruction step of the CFG recovery process. They take as input the current protected binary, </span><code>CFGStepState</code><span>, and the current step-in instruction. Each rule contains specific logic designed to detect particular types of instruction characteristics introduced by the obfuscator. Based on the detection of these characteristics, the rules determine how the traversal should proceed. For instance, a rule might decide to continue traversal, skip certain instructions, or halt the process based on the nature of the mutation.</span></li>

<p><span>With the raw instructions successfully recovered, the next step is to normalize the control flow. While the raw recovery process ensures that all original instructions are captured, these instructions alone do not form a cohesive and orderly function. To achieve a streamlined control flow, we must filter and refine the recovered instructions—a process we refer to as normalization. This stage involves several key tasks:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Updating branch targets:</strong><span> Once all of the obfuscator-introduced code (instruction dispatchers and mutations) are fully removed, all branch instructions must be redirected to their correct destinations. The scattering effect introduced by obfuscation often leaves branches pointing to unrelated code segments.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Merging overlapping basic blocks:</strong><span> Contrary to the idea of a basic block as a strictly single-entry, single-exit structure, compilers can produce code in which one basic block begins within another. This overlapping of basic blocks commonly appears in loop structures. As a result, these overlaps must be resolved to ensure a coherent CFG.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proper function boundary instruction:</strong><span> Each function must begin and end at well-defined boundaries within the binary&#39;s memory space. Correctly identifying and enforcing these boundaries is essential for accurate CFG representation and subsequent analysis.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h6><span>Simplifying with Synthetic Boundary Jumps</span></h6>
<p><span>Rather than relying on traditional basic block abstractions—which can impose unnecessary overhead—we employ synthetic boundary jumps to simplify CFG normalization. These artificial </span><code>jmp</code><span> instructions link otherwise disjointed instructions, allowing us to avoid splitting overlapping blocks and ensuring that each function concludes at a proper boundary instruction. This approach also streamlines our binary rewriting process when reconstructing the recovered functions into the final deobfuscated output binary.</span></p>
<p><span>Merging overlapping basic blocks and ensuring functions have proper boundary instructions amount to the same problem—determining which scattered instructions should be linked together. To illustrate this, we will examine how synthetic jumps effectively resolve this issue by ensuring that functions conclude with the correct boundary instructions. The exact same approach applies to merging basic blocks together.</span></p>
<h6><span>Synthetic Boundary Jumps to Ensure Function Boundaries</span></h6>
<p><span>Consider an example where we have successfully recovered a function using our DFS-based rule-guided approach. Inspecting the recovered instructions in the </span><code>CFGState </code><span>reveals a </span><code>mov</code><span> instruction as the final operation. If we were to reconstruct this function in memory as-is, the absence of a subsequent fallthrough instruction would compromise the function&#39;s logic.</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig35.max-1000x1000.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig35.max-1000x1000.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig35.max-1000x1000.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig35.max-1000x1000.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 35: Example of a raw recovery that does not end with a natural function boundary instruction</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>To address this, we introduce a synthetic jump whenever the last recovered instruction is not a natural function boundary (e.g., </span><code>ret</code><span>, </span><code>jmp</code><span>, </span><code>int3</code><span>).</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig36.max-1100x1100.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig36.max-1100x1100.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig36.max-1100x1100.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig36.max-1100x1100.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 36: Simple Python routine that identifies function boundary instructions</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>We determine the fallthrough address, and if it points to an obfuscator-introduced instruction, we continue forward until reaching the first regular instruction.

<li>
<p><span>If it is not, obtain the connecting fallthrough instruction from the recovery cache and append it to the normalized cache.</span></p>

<p><span>Recovering and restoring the original import table revolves around identifying which import location is associated with which import dispatcher stub. From the stub dispatcher, we can parse the respective </span><code>obf_imp_t</code> <span>reference in order to determine the protected import that it represents.</span></p>
<p><span>We pursue the following logic:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify each valid call/jmp location associated to an import</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>The memory displacement for these will point to the respective dispatcher stub.</span></li>
<li><span>For HEADERLESS mode, we need to first resolve the fixup table to ensure the displacement points to a valid dispatcher stub.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>For each valid location traverse the dispatcher stub to extract the obf_imp_t</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>The </span><code>obf_imp_t</code> <span>contains the RVAs to the encrypted DLL and API names.</span></li>

</li>
<li><strong>Implement the string decryption logic</strong>

<p><span>We have to resolve the fixup table when we recover imports for the HEADERLESS protection in order to identify which import location is associated with which dispatcher. The memory displacement at the protected import site will be paired with its resolved location inside the table.

<h4><span>Recovering the Import</span></h4>
<p><span>Having obtained all potential import locations from the brute-force scan and accounted for relocations in HEADERLESS mode, we can proceed with the final verifications to recover each protected import. The recovery process is conducted as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Decode the location into a valid call or jmp instruction</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Any failure in decoding indicates that the location does not contain a valid instruction and can be safely ignored.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Use the memory displacement to locate the stub for the import</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>In HEADERLESS mode, each displacement serves as a lookup key into the fixup table for the respective dispatcher.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Extract the </strong><code>obf_imp_t</code> <strong>structure within the dispatcher</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>This is achieved by statically traversing a dispatcher&#39;s disassembly listing.</span></li>
<li><span>The first </span><code>lea</code><span> instruction encountered will contain the reference to the </span><code>obf_imp_t</code><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Process the </strong><code>obf_imp_t</code> <strong>to decrypt both the DLL and API names</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Utilize the two RVAs contained within the structure to locate the encrypted blobs for the DLL and API names.</span></li>

Recall that a headerless-protected input is a raw, headerless PE binary, almost analogous to a shellcode blob. From this blob we produce an entirely new, functioning binary with the entirety of its import protection completely restored. And we can do the same for all protection modes.</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig55.max-1400x1400.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig55.max-1400x1400.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig55.max-1400x1400.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig55.max-1400x1400.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 55: Display of completely restored import table for a binary protected in HEADERLESS mode</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><h2><span>Building Relocations in Deobfuscated Binaries</span></h2>
<p><span>Now that we can fully recover the CFG of protected binaries and provide complete restoration of the original import tables, the final phase of the deobfuscator involves merging these elements to produce a functional deobfuscated binary. The code responsible for this process is encapsulated within the </span><code>recover_output64.py</code><span> and the </span><code>pefile_utils.py</code> <span>Python files.</span></p>
<p><span>The rebuild process comprises two primary steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Building the Output Image Template</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Building Relocations</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>1. Building the Output Image Template</strong></h4>
<p><span>Creating an output image template is essential for generating the deobfuscated binary. This involves two key tasks:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Template PE Image: </strong><span>A Portable Executable (PE) template that serves as the container for the output binary that incorporates the restoration of all obfuscated components. We also need to be cognizant of all the different characteristics between in-memory PE executables and on-file PE executables.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling Different Protection Modes: </strong><span>Different protection modes and input stipulate different requirements.</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Headerless variants </strong><span>have their file headers stripped. We must account for these variations to accurately reconstruct a functioning binary.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Selective protection </strong><span>preserves the original imports to maintain functionality as well as includes a specific import protection for all the imports leveraged within the selected functions. </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>2. Building Relocations</strong></h4>
<p><span>Building relocations is a critical and intricate part of the deobfuscation process. This step ensures that all address references within the deobfuscated binary are correctly adjusted to maintain functionality. It generally revolves around the following two phases:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Calculating Relocatable Displacements</strong><span>: Identifying all memory references within the binary that require relocation. This involves calculating the new addresses where these references will point to. The technique we will use is generating a lookup table that maps original memory references to their new relocatable addresses.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply Fixups: </strong><span>Modifies the binary&#39;s code to reflect the new relocatable addresses. This utilizes the aforementioned lookup table to apply necessary fixups to all instruction displacements that reference memory. This ensures that all memory references within the binary correctly point to their intended locations.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>We intentionally omit the details of showcasing the rebuilding of the output binary image because, while essential to the deobfuscation process, it is straightforward enough and just overly tedious to be worthwhile examining in any depth. Instead, we focus exclusively on relocations, as they are more nuanced and reveal important characteristics that are not as apparent but must be understood when rewriting binaries.</span></p>
<h3><span>Overview of the Relocation Process</span></h3>
<p><span>Rebuilding relocations is a critical step in restoring a deobfuscated binary to an executable state. This process involves adjusting memory references within the code so that all references point to the correct locations after the code has been moved or modified. On the x86-64 architecture, this primarily concerns instructions that use </span><strong>RIP-relative addressing</strong><span>, a mode where memory references are relative to the instruction pointer.</span></p>
<p><span>Relocation is necessary when the layout of a binary changes, such as when code is inserted, removed, or shifted during deobfuscation. Given our deobfuscation approach extracts the original instructions from the obfuscator, we are required to relocate each recovered instruction appropriately into a new code segment. This ensures that the deobfuscated state preserves the validity of all memory references and that the accuracy of the original control and data flow is sustained.</span></p>
<h4><span>Understanding Instruction Relocation</span></h4>
<p><span>Instruction relocation revolves around the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instruction&#39;s memory address: </strong><span>the location in memory where an instruction resides.</span></li>
<li><strong>Instruction&#39;s memory memory references: </strong><span>references to memory locations used by the instruction&#39;s operands.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Consider the following two instructions as illustrations:</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig56.max-300x300.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig56.max-300x300.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig56.max-300x300.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig56.max-300x300.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 56: Illustration of two instructions that require relocation</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Unconditional </strong><code>jmp</code> <strong>instruction</strong><span>This instruction is located at memory address </span><code>0x1000.</code> <span>It references its branch target at address </span><code>0x4E22</code><span>. The displacement encoded within the instruction is </span><code>0x3E1D</code><span>, which is used to calculate the branch target relative to the instruction&#39;s position. Since it employs RIP-relative addressing, the destination is calculated by adding the displacement to the length of the instruction and its memory address.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lea</code><span> </span><strong>instruction</strong><span>This is the branch target for the </span><code>jmp</code> <span>instruction located at </span><code>0x4E22</code><span>. It also contains a memory reference to the data segment, with an encoded displacement of </span><code>0x157</code><span>.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>When relocating these instructions, we must address both of the following aspects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Changing the instruction&#39;s address:</strong><span> When we move an instruction to a new memory location during the relocation process, we inherently change its memory address. For example, if we relocate this instruction from </span><code>0x1000</code><span> to </span><code>0x2000</code><span>, the instruction&#39;s address becomes </span><code>0x2000</code><span>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adjusting memory displacements:</strong><span> The displacement within the instruction (</span><code>0x3E1D</code> <span>for the </span><code>jmp</code><span>, </span><code>0x157</code> <span>for the </span><code>lea</code><span>) is calculated based on the instruction&#39;s original location and the location of its reference. If the instruction moves, the displacement no longer points to the correct target address. Therefore, we must recalculate the displacement to reflect the instruction&#39;s new position.</span></p>
</li>
</ul></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig57.max-300x300.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig57.max-300x300.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig57.max-300x300.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig57.max-300x300.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 57: Updated illustration demonstration of what relocation would look like</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>When relocating instructions during the deobfuscation process, we must ensure accurate control flow and data access. This requires us to adjust both the instruction&#39;s memory address and any displacements that reference other memory locations. Failing to update these values invalidates the recovered CFG.</span></p>
<h4><span>What Is RIP-Relative Addressing?</span></h4>
<p><strong>RIP-relative addressing</strong><span> is a mode where the instruction references memory at an offset relative to the </span><strong>RIP</strong><span> (instruction pointer) register, which points to the next instruction to be executed. Instead of using absolute addresses, the instruction encapsulates the referenced address via a signed 32-bit displacement from the current instruction pointer.</span></p>
<p><span>Addressing relative to the instruction pointer exists on x86 as well, but only for control-transfer instructions that support a relative displacement (e.g., JCC conditional instructions, near CALLs, and near JMPs). The x64 ISA extended this to account for almost all memory references being RIP-relative. For example, </span><a href="http://www.nynaeve.net/?p=192" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>most data references in x64 Windows binaries are RIP-relative</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>An excellent tool to visualize the intricacies of a decoded Intel x64 instruction is </span><a href="https://github.com/zyantific/zydis/blob/master/tools/ZydisInfo.c" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ZydisInfo</span></a><span>. Here we use it to illustrate how a LEA instruction (encoded as</span> <code>488D151B510600</code><span>) references RIP-relative memory at </span><code>0x6511b</code><span>.</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig58.max-1500x1500.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig58.max-1500x1500.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig58.max-1500x1500.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig58.max-1500x1500.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 58: ZydisInfo output for the lea instruction</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>For most instructions, the displacement is encoded in the final four bytes of the instruction.

<p><span>For rebuilding relocations we take the following approach:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Rebuilding the code section and creating a relocation map</strong><span>With the recovered CFG and imports, we commit the changes to a new code section that contains the fully deobfuscated code. We do this by:</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Function-by-function processing</strong><span>: rebuild each function one at a time. This allows us to manage the relocation of each instruction within its respective function.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tracking instruction locations</strong><span>: As we rebuild each function, we track the new memory locations of each instruction. This involves maintaining a global relocation dictionary that maps original instruction addresses to their new addresses in the deobfuscated binary. This dictionary is crucial for accurately updating references during the fixup phase.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Applying fixups</strong><span>After rebuilding the code section and establishing the relocation map, we proceed to modify the instructions so that their memory references point to the correct locations in the deobfuscated binary. This restores the binary&#39;s complete functionality and is achieved by </span><strong>adjusting memory references</strong><span> to code or data an instruction may have.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><span>Rebuilding the Code Section and Creating a Relocation Map</span></h4>
<p><span>To construct the new deobfuscated code segment, we iterate over each recovered function and copy all instructions sequentially, starting from a fixed offset—for example, </span><code>0x1000</code><span>. During this process, we build a global relocation dictionary (</span><code>global_relocs</code><span>) that maps each instruction to its relocated address. This mapping is essential for adjusting memory references during the fixup phase.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><code>global_relocs</code><span> dictionary uses a tuple as the key for lookups, and each key is associated with the relocated address of the instruction it represents. The tuple consists of the following three components:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Original starting address of the function</strong><span>: The address where the function begins in the protected binary. It identifies the function to which the instruction belongs.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Original instruction address within the function</strong><span>: The address of the instruction in the protected binary. For the first instruction in a function, this will be the function&#39;s starting address.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Synthetic boundary JMP flag</strong><span>: A boolean value indicating whether the instruction is a synthetic boundary jump introduced during normalization. These synthetic instructions were not present in the original obfuscated binary, and we need to account for them specifically during relocation because they have no original address.</span></p>
</li>

<li><strong>Initialize current offset<br/></strong><span>Set the starting point in the new image buffer where the code section will be placed. The variable </span><code>curr_off</code><span> is initialized to </span><code>starting_off</code><span>, which is typically </span><code>0x1000</code><span>. This represents the conventional start address of the </span><code>.text</code><span> section in PE files. For SELECTIVE mode, this will be the offset to the start of the protected function.</span></li>
<li><strong>Iterate over recovered functions<br/></strong><span>Loop through each recovered function in the deobfuscated control flow graph (</span><code>d.cfg</code><span>). </span><code>func_ea</code><span> is the original function entry address, and </span><code>rfn</code><span> is a </span><code>RecoveredFunc</code><span> object encapsulating the recovered function&#39;s instructions and metadata.</span>
<ol>
<li><strong>Handle the function start address first</strong>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Set function&#39;s relocated start address: </strong><span>Assign the current offset to </span><code>rfn.reloc_ea</code><span>, marking where this function will begin in the new image buffer.</span></p>
</li>
<li><span><strong>Update global relocation map: </strong><span>Add an entry to the global relocation map </span><code>d.global_relocs</code><span> to map the original function address to its new location.</span></span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Iterate over each recovered instruction<br/></strong><span>Loop through the normalized flow of instructions within the function. We use the </span><code>normalized_flow</code><span> as it allows us to iterate over each instruction linearly as we apply it to the new image.</span>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>Set instruction&#39;s relocated address: </strong><span>Assign the current offset to </span><code>r.reloc_ea</code><span>, indicating where this instruction will reside in the new image buffer.</span></span></li>
<li><span><strong>Update global relocation map: </strong><span>Add an entry to </span><code>d.global_relocs</code><span> for the instruction, mapping its original address to the relocated address.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span><strong>Update the output image: </strong><span>Write the instruction bytes to the new image buffer </span><code>d.newimgbuffer</code><span> at the current offset. If the instruction was modified during deobfuscation (</span><code>r.updated_bytes</code><span>), use those bytes; otherwise, use the original bytes (</span><code>r.instr.bytes</code><span>).</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><strong>Advance the offset: </strong><span>Increment </span><code>curr_off</code><span> by the size of the instruction to point to the next free position in the buffer and move on to the next instruction until the remainder are exhausted.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Align current offset to 16-byte boundary</strong><span>After processing all instructions in a function, align </span><code>curr_off</code><span> to the next 16-byte boundary. We use 8 bytes as an arbitrary pointer-sized value from the last instruction to pad so that the next function won&#39;t conflict with the last instruction of the previous function. This further ensures proper memory alignment for the next function, which is essential for performance and correctness on x86-64 architectures. Then repeat the process from step 2 until all functions have been exhausted.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>This step-by-step process accurately rebuilds the deobfuscated binary&#39;s executable code section. By relocating each instruction, the code prepares the output template for the subsequent fixup phase, where references are adjusted to point to their correct locations.</span></p>
<h4><span>Applying Fixups</span></h4>
<p><span>After building the deobfuscated code section and relocating each recovered function in full, we apply fixups to correct addresses within the recovered code. This process adjusts the instruction bytes in the new output image so that all references point to the correct locations. It is the final step in reconstructing a functional deobfuscated binary.</span></p>
<p><span>We categorize fixups into three distinct categories, based primarily on whether they apply to control flow or data flow instructions. We further distinguish between two types of control flow instructions: standard branching instructions and those introduced by the obfuscator through the import protection. Each type has specific nuances that require tailored handling, allowing us to apply precise logic to each category.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Import Relocations</strong><span>: These involve calls and jumps to recovered imports.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control Flow Relocations</strong><span>: All standard control flow branching branching instructions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Flow Relocations</strong><span>: Instructions that reference static memory locations.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Using these three categorizations, the core logic boils down to the following two phases:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resolving displacement fixups</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Differentiate between displacements encoded as immediate operands (branching instructions) and those in memory operands (data accesses and import calls).</span></li>
<li><span>Calculate the correct fixup values for these displacements using the </span><code>d</code><strong>.</strong><code>global_relocs </code><span>map generated prior.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Update the output image buffer</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Once the displacements have been resolved, write the updated instruction bytes into the new code segment to reflect the changes permanently.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><span>To achieve this, we utilize several helper functions and lambda expressions.

<li><strong>Define lambda helper expressions</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>PACK_FIXUP</code><span>: packs a 32-bit fixup value into a little-endian byte array.</span></li>
<li><code>CALC_FIXUP</code><span>: calculates the fixup value by computing the difference between the destination address (</span><code>dest</code><span>) and the end of the current instruction (</span><code>r.reloc_ea + size</code><span>), ensuring it fits within 32 bits.</span></li>
<li><code>IS_IN_DATA</code><span>: checks if a given address is within the data section of the binary. We exclude relocating these addresses, as we preserve the data section at its original location.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Resolve fixups for each instruction</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Import and data flow relocations</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Utilize the </span><code>resolve_disp_fixup_and_apply</code><span> helper function as both encode the displacement within a memory operand.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Control flow relocations</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Use the </span><code>resolve_imm_fixup_and_apply</code><span> helper as the displacement is encoded in an immediate operand.</span></li>
<li><span>During our CFG recovery, we transformed each </span><code>jmp</code><span> and </span><code>jcc</code><span> instruction to its near jump equivalent (from 2 bytes to 6 bytes) to avoid the shortcomings of 1-byte short branches.</span>
<ul>
<li><span>We force a 32-bit displacement for each branch to guarantee a sufficient range for every fixup.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Update the output image buffer</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Decode the updated instruction bytes to have it reflect within the </span><code>RecoveredInstr</code> <span>that represents it.</span></li>
<li><span>Write the updated bytes to the new image buffer</span>
<ul>
<li><code>updated_bytes</code> <span>reflects the final opcodes for a fully relocated instruction.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>With the helpers in place, the following Python code implements the final processing for each relocation type.</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig64.max-1200x1200.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig64.max-1200x1200.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig64.max-1200x1200.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig64.max-1200x1200.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 64: The three core loops that address each relocation category</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><ul>
<li><strong>Import Relocations: </strong><span>The first for loop handles fixups for import relocations, utilizing data generated during the Import Recovery phase. It iterates over every recovered instruction</span><span> </span><code>r</code><span> </span><span>within the</span><span> </span><code>rfn.relocs_imports</code><span> </span><span>cache and does the following</span><span>:</span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prepare updated instruction bytes: </strong><span>initialize </span><code>r.updated_bytes</code><span> </span><span>with a mutable copy of the original instruction bytes to prepare it for modification</span><span>.</span></li>
<li><strong>Retrieve import entry and displacement: </strong><span>obtain the import entry from the imports dictionary</span><span> </span><code>d.imports</code><span> </span><span>and retrieve the new RVA from </span><code>d.import_to_rva_map</code><span> using the import&#39;s API name.</span></li>
<li><strong>Apply fixup: </strong><span>use the</span><span> </span><code>resolve_disp_fixup_and_apply</code><span> helper to calculate and apply the fixup for the new RVA. This adjusts the instruction&#39;s displacement to correctly reference the imported function.</span></li>
<li><strong>Update image buffer: </strong><span>write </span><code>r.updated_bytes</code><span> </span><span>back into the new image using</span><span> </span><code>update_reloc_in_img</code><span>. </span><span>This finalizes the fixup for the instruction in the output image.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Control Flow Relocations: </strong><span>The second for loop handles fixups for control flow branching relocations (</span><code>call</code><span>, </span><code>jmp</code><span>, </span><code>jcc</code><span>). Iterating over each entry</span><span> </span><span>in </span><code>rfn.relocs_ctrlflow</code><span>, it does the following:</span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retrieve destination</strong><span>: extract the original branch destination target from the immediate operand.</span></li>
<li><strong>Get relocated address</strong><span>: reference the relocation dictionary</span><span> </span><code>d.global_relocs</code><span> </span><span>to obtain the branch target&#39;s relocated address. If it&#39;s a call target, then we specifically look up the relocated address for the start of the called function.</span></li>
<li><strong>Apply fixup</strong><span>: use</span><span> </span><code>resolve_imm_fixup_and_apply</code><span> </span><span>to adjust the branch target to its relocated address.</span></li>
<li><strong>Update buffer</strong><span>: finalize the fixup by writing</span><span> </span><code>r.updated_bytes</code><span> </span><span>back into the new image using </span><code>update_reloc_in_img</code><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Flow Relocations: </strong><span>The final loop handles the resolution of all static memory references stored within</span><span> </span><code>rfn.relocs_dataflow</code><span>. </span><span>First, we establish a list of </span><code>KNOWN </code><span>instructions that require data reference relocations. Given the extensive variety of such instructions, this categorization simplifies our approach and ensures a comprehensive understanding of all possible instructions present in the protected binaries. Following this, the logic mirrors that of the import and control flow relocations, systematically processing each relevant instruction to accurately adjust their memory references. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>After reconstructing the code section and establishing the relocation map, we proceeded to adjust each instruction categorized for relocation within the deobfuscated binary. This was the final step in restoring the output binary&#39;s full functionality, as it ensures that each instruction accurately references the intended code or data segments.</span></p>
<h4><span>Observing the Results</span></h4>
<p><span>To demonstrate our deobfuscation library for ScatterBrain, we conduct a test study showcasing its functionality. For this test study, we select three samples: a </span><strong>POISONPLUG.SHADOW</strong><span> headerless backdoor and two embedded plugins.</span></p>
<p><span>We develop a Python script, </span><code>example_deobfuscator.py</code><span>, that consumes from our library and implements all of the recovery techniques outlined earlier. Figure 65 and Figure 66 showcase the code within our example deobfuscator:</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig65.max-1300x1300.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig65.max-1300x1300.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig65.max-1300x1300.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig65.max-1300x1300.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 65: The first half of the Python code in example_deobfuscator.py</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig66.max-1300x1300.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig66.max-1300x1300.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig66.max-1300x1300.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scatterbrain-fig66.max-1300x1300.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Figure 66: The second half of the Python code in example_deobfuscator.py</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>Running </span><code>example_deobfuscator.py</code><span> we can see the following.
