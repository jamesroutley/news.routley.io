</div><div><p>Over on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1482843432657825805">I said something</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thesis: most websites and their technical design are designed
for the short term and implicitly for short lifetimes. Five
years? Maybe. Ten years? Most people aren&#39;t thinking about that sort
of lifetime. Fifteen or twenty years? Forget it, it&#39;ll be plowed under
by then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An organization and its website may live for a long time (and many
people hope for that). The visual design and interaction of the
website is likely to change and turn over more frequently, partly
because the entire web is full of design trends that come and go;
keeping your website&#39;s look &#39;up to date&#39; requires changes. On top
of that, the capabilities and constraints of the devices that your
website is viewed on keep changing. My strong impression is that
the technical decisions and design are considered to be even more
ephemeral than the visual design, with people accepting that there
will be significant churn in that area over time.</p>

<p>(One reason for technical churn is that many organizations expect
to grow and scale up, and sometimes they will have to scale down
certain lines of business.)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people building websites explicitly think about the
expected lifetime and plan for whatever specific lifetime they
expect (at least, not usually). But I do think it influences what
technologies they consider and choose, and in particular I think
people are influenced by a general feeling that no matter what they
do, it&#39;s probably not lasting for all that long. Or, to put things
another way, they won&#39;t be stuck with what they&#39;ve built for all
that long, left to operate and maintain it no matter what. Something
will change enough to force changes regardless of what they do.</p>

<p>(This is in one sense an analog to the programming argument of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a>,
which very roughly that you can&#39;t predict the future well enough
to engineer for it beyond general principles, so you should build
what works for you today.)</p>

<p>I believe that if you asked people building websites to explicitly
consider that their work would have a relatively long lifetime, say
ten years, that you would get somewhat different technical designs.
Or at least I would like to hope that you would, and that people
would consider issues like how much churn there had been in various
technology choices over the past ten years and how much there might
be in the next ten. I think you would get rather different designs,
and those designs would be easier to keep running for ten years.</p>

<p>Also, a lot of the time this would be overkill, because people are
right. A lot of websites do not get to live more or less as-is for
ten years, or even five, because external requirements change too
much. The organization changes, the needs change, the scale that
the website is working on changes, and so on.</p>

<p>(This thesis is partly sparked by reading <a href="https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/no-static-websites">this article</a> and having
reactions to it.)</p>
