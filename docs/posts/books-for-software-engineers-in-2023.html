    <h1>Books for Software Engineers in 2023</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>As a software engineer, staying up-to-date with the latest developments and best practices is essential for growth. One of my favorite (and what I feel is overlooked) methods for growth is reading books. We spend a large part of our day reading Stack Overflow and blog posts, but books have really helped me see things in a different light or understand something I do not come across on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In 2022, I read a number of books that were extremely valuable to my career as a software engineer. Here are nine that I highly recommend for software engineers at all stages of their careers to consider adding to their reading lists for 2023:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20657434-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things">“The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers”</a> by Ben Horowitz offers candid and practical advice on the challenges of entrepreneurship.

<p><img src="https://grantisom.com/uploads/2023/a97bedecb3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43713.Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs">“Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,&#34;</a> also known as the “Wizard Book,” is a classic text that covers the fundamental concepts of computer science and programming using the Lisp language.

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36645100-inspired">“INSPIRED: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love”</a> by Marty Cagan is a must-read for anyone looking to create successful tech products. Cagan covers topics such as defining the product vision, building a strong team, and gathering customer feedback, and provides practical advice on how to apply these principles to your own work. Commonly recommended for product managers, I think its a great read for engineers as well as it will help when working cross-functionally with your product team.</p>
<p>These books provided invaluable insights and kept me motivated and inspired throughout the year. “An Elegant Puzzle” was particularly helpful in figuring out how to more effectively handle support issues within my team, while “Software Engineering at Google” offered valuable guidance as we were setting up a new project and repository. I hope this list of recommendations will provide some useful reading options for you in 2023 as you continue to grow and develop in your software engineering career.</p>
