    <h1>Show HN: Garnix, fast and easy CI for Nix</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello HN!</p><p>For the past few months, I&#39;ve been building a Nix-specific CI service, and quite a few people have been productively using it, so I thought I&#39;d Show HN it.</p><p>You might be wondering why build a Nix-specific CI. It turns out its quite hard to get a really good CI setup for Nix without spending a lot of time or money on it (or both), and even then solutions don&#39;t tend to be optimal.</p><p>Garnix, on the other hand, handles everything, and simply. Just create an account, install the GitHub app on the repositories you want, and you&#39;re good to go! Each package gets its own GitHub check, and separate log output, which makes it really easy to figure out what went wrong (you can see an example here: <a href="https://garnix.io/build/X9knYZOB" rel="nofollow">https://garnix.io/build/X9knYZOB</a>). Builds are very fast compared to e.g Github Actions. The build artifacts are made available in a Nix cache so you never have to rebuild locally. And there are builders for x86-64 Linux as well as M1 Macs and aarch64 Linux.</p><p>Try it out: <a href="https://garnix.io" rel="nofollow">https://garnix.io</a>. It&#39;s free, though if you like it, consider donating!  (Note that it only works with flakes.)</p><p>Cheers,
  Julian</p></div></div></div>
