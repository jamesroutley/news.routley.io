    <h1>Everyone in Seattle hates AI</h1>

        <!-- OPENING: THE LUNCH -->
        <p>
          I grabbed lunch with a former Microsoft coworker I&#39;ve always admired—one of those engineers who can take any idea, even a mediocre one, and immediately find the gold in it. I wanted her take on <a href="https://wanderfugl.com" target="_blank">Wanderfugl</a> 🐦, the AI-powered map I&#39;ve been building full-time. I expected encouragement. At worst, overly generous feedback because she knows what I&#39;ve sacrificed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, she reacted to it with a level of negativity I&#39;d never seen her direct at me before.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I finally got her to explain what was wrong, none of it had anything to do with what I built. She talked about Copilot 365. And Microsoft AI. And every miserable AI tool she&#39;s forced to use at work. My product barely featured. Her reaction wasn&#39;t about me at all. It was about her entire environment.
        </p>

        <h3>The AI Layoffs</h3>

        <p>
          Her PM had been laid off months earlier. The team asked why. Their director told them it was because the PM org &#34;wasn&#39;t effective enough at using Copilot 365.&#34;
        </p>

        <p>
          I nervously laughed. This director got up in a group meeting and said that someone lost their job over this?
        </p>

        <p>
          After a pause I tried to share how much better I&#39;ve been feeling—how AI tools helped me learn faster, how much they accelerated my work on Wanderfugl. I didn&#39;t fully grok how tone deaf I was being though. She&#39;s drowning in resentment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I left the lunch deflated and weirdly guilty, like building an AI product made me part of the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          But then I realized this was bigger than one conversation. Every time I shared Wanderfugl with a Seattle engineer, I got the same reflexive, critical, negative response. This wasn&#39;t true in Bali, Tokyo, Paris, or San Francisco—people were curious, engaged, wanted to understand what I was building. But in Seattle? Instant hostility the moment they heard &#34;AI.&#34;
        </p>

        <h2>The people at big tech in Seattle are not ok</h2>

        <p>
          When I joined Microsoft, there was still a sense of possibility. Satya was pushing &#34;growth mindset&#34; everywhere. Leaders talked about empowerment and breaking down silos. And even though there was always a gap between the slogans and reality, there was room to try things.
        </p>

        <p>
          I leaned into it. I pushed into areas nobody wanted to touch, like Windows update compression, because it lived awkwardly across three teams. Somehow, a 40% improvement made it out alive. Leadership backed it. The people trying to kill it shrank back into their fiefdoms. It felt like the culture wanted change.
        </p>

        <p>
          That world is gone.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the layoff directive hit, every org braced for impact. Anything not strictly inside the org&#39;s charter was axed. I went from shipping a major improvement in Windows 11 to having zero projects overnight. I quit shortly after. In hindsight, getting laid off with severance might&#39;ve been better than watching the culture collapse in slow motion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then came the AI panic.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you could classify your project as &#34;AI,&#34; you were safe and prestigious. If you couldn&#39;t, you were nobody. Overnight, most engineers got rebranded as &#34;not AI talent.&#34; And then came the final insult: everyone was forced to use Microsoft&#39;s AI tools whether they worked or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          Copilot for Word. Copilot for PowerPoint. Copilot for email. Copilot for code. Worse than the tools they replaced. Worse than competitors&#39; tools. Sometimes worse than doing the work manually.
        </p>

        <p>
          But you weren&#39;t allowed to fix them—that was the AI org&#39;s turf. You were supposed to use them, fail to see productivity gains, and keep quiet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, AI teams became a protected class. Everyone else saw comp stagnate, stock refreshers evaporate, and performance reviews tank. And if your team failed to meet expectations? Clearly you weren&#39;t &#34;embracing AI.&#34;
        </p>

        <p>
          Bring up AI in a Seattle coffee shop now and people react like you&#39;re advocating asbestos.
        </p>

        <p>
          Amazon folks are slightly more insulated, but not by much. The old Seattle deal—Amazon treats you poorly but pays you more—only masks the rot.
        </p>

        <h2>Self-Limiting Beliefs</h2>

        <p>
          This belief system—that AI is useless and that you&#39;re not good enough to work on it anyway—hurts three groups:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1. The companies.</strong></p>

        <p>
          <strong>2. The engineers.</strong></p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. Anyone trying to build anything new in Seattle.</strong></p>

        <p>
          And the loop feeds itself:</p>

        <p>
          My former coworker—the composite of three people for anonymity—now believes she&#39;s both unqualified for AI work and that AI isn&#39;t worth doing anyway. She&#39;s wrong on both counts, but the culture made sure she&#39;d land there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seattle has talent as good as anywhere. But in San Francisco, people still believe they can change the world—so sometimes they actually do.
