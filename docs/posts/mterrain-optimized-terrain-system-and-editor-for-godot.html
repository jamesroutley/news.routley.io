    <h1>MTerrain: Optimized terrain system and editor for Godot</h1>

<p>Lately I&#39;ve been working on a translation tool that plugs into Adobe Illustrator, which will help AFP&#39;s graphics department automatically <strong>publish data visualizations in multiple languages</strong>.</p>
<p>The challenge of a translation tool for <em>graphics</em> is that translating text between languages <strong>changes its length</strong>, and the new text then needs to be fit back into a coherent visual layout.</p>
<p>Fitting text into the right place without overlaps means taking lots measurements, adjusting various elements, then taking more measurements etc., and I was running into a problem with high CPU usage that sometimes made Illustrator freeze.</p>
<p>I tried out various optimizations, but what really helped stabilize performance was, counterintuitively, making it <strong>run <em>more slowly</em></strong> instead of speeding it up. It was a good lesson about how to manage resources in programming languages and scripting environments that don&#39;t let you control them directly.</p>
<h2>To move fast, go slowly</h2>
<p>Many scripting environments—including <a href="https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/">ExtendScript</a> for Adobe applications—run operations sequentially on a single thread. This can cause a problem where a script inadvertently becomes a CPU hog, refusing to yield processing time to essential system operations.</p>
<p>The fix—or at least, the one that worked for me—was to add short, strategic delays into processing loops.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a simple implementation in ExtendScript (hence the pre-ES6 syntax):</p>
<pre><code>// Process items in a collection
for (var i = 0; i &lt; items.length; i++) {
    processItem(items[i]);
    // Add a pause every few items
    if (i % 5 === 0) {
        $.sleep(20); // Pause for 20 milliseconds
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The delay of 20ms—imperceptible to users—then allows the system to handle other tasks and prevents CPU saturation.</p>
<p>What surprised me about this (perhaps because I don&#39;t usually work with scripting environments?) was that adding tiny delays made my scripts complete <em>much faster</em> overall.</p>
<p>Previously, when I ran my translation script on large, complex graphics documents, it would trigger some kind of system-level resource throttling that would slow execution down to a crawl. Adding the small delays prevented the script from hitting whatever threshold was triggering this, allowing it to run on complex graphics without problem.</p>
<h2>Adapting to complexity</h2>
<p>To further optimize this optimization, I&#39;m also trying to adapt the level of delays to the complexity of each operation. So a line of one or two words in an isolated text box doesn&#39;t need much delay added, whereas a long chunk of text in a box that borders with others should add a longer pause, because it&#39;s more computationally demanding.</p>
<p>The implementation ends up something like:</p>
<pre><code>// Add longer delays for more complex operations
var processingComplexity = calculateComplexity(item);
if (processingComplexity &gt; highThreshold) {
    $.sleep(100); // Longer pause for complex work
} else if (processingComplexity &gt; mediumThreshold) {
    $.sleep(50);  // Medium pause
} else {
    $.sleep(10);  // Short pause for simple operations
}
</code></pre>
<p>As someone who mostly writes Python code to process data, developing a software plugin that is executed inside a different and (to me) fairly opaque environment has been a steep learning curve.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve enjoyed the challenge so far, and it feels like a real step up in responsibility to build something that will be used in production by a major news agency.</p><small><time>2025</time> © Corin Faife.<a href="https://corinfaife.co/feed.xml">RSS</a></small></article></div></div>
