<p>The SSD I chose is a <strong>Crucial BX500</strong>, which we’ve tested numerous times both on our website and on my YouTube channel.</p>
<h3 id="softwares-do-ssd"><strong>ATENTION: BEFORE YOU CONTINUE READING</strong>!!!</h3>
<p>Firstly, this procedure is safer than overclocking, but it still requires caution. Only proceed if you are genuinely interested, as I cannot be held responsible if any steps are executed incorrectly. I will explain as clearly as possible to minimize any misunderstandings.</p>
<p>This voids the warranty of any SSD. <strong>AND REMEMBER, WHEN FLASHING THE FIRMWARE TO THE SSD, ALL DATA WILL BE ERASED</strong>, so be sure to back up your devices before proceeding with anything.</p>
<h3 id="unboxing"><strong>NECESSARY TOOLS</strong></h3>
<p>To perform this procedure, it was necessary to use an adapter SATA to USB 3.0 adapter with the<strong> Jmicron JMS578 Bridge Chip</strong> model.</p>

<p>In addition to, we also need a clamp to perform the short on the ROM/Safe Mode terminals on the SSD’s PCB.</p>
<h3 id="unboxing">Technical Specs</h3>
<p>Before we move on to the tutorial, let’s analyze this SSD a little further.</p>
<p><strong>Controller</strong><br/></p>
<p>The SSD controller is responsible for handling all data management tasks, including over-provisioning and garbage collection, among other background functions. Naturally, this contributes to the SSD’s overall performance.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ssd-crucial-bx500-500gb-controlador.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="332" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ssd-crucial-bx500-500gb-controlador.jpg?resize=720%2C332&amp;ssl=1" alt="ssd crucial bx500 500gb controlador" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 5" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>In this project, the SSD utilizes the <strong>Silicon Motion</strong> controller model <strong>SM2259XT2</strong>, which is a new variant of the <strong>SM2259XT</strong>.</p>
<p>In this case, it’s a <strong>single-core</strong> controller, meaning it has one main core responsible for managing the NANDs, with a <strong>32-bit ARC</strong> architecture, not <strong>ARM </strong>as we’re accustomed to. This controller has an operating frequency up to <strong>550 MHz</strong>, but as we’ll see in the following image, in this project, it was operating at <strong>437.5 MHz</strong>.</p>
<p>This controller also supports up to <strong>2 communication channels</strong> with a bus speed of up to <strong>800 MT/s</strong>, where each of these channels supports up to <strong>8 Chip Enable</strong> commands, allowing the controller to communicate with up to <strong>16 Dies</strong> simultaneously using the <strong>interleaving</strong> technique.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-02-111225.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="496" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-02-111225.png?resize=720%2C496&amp;ssl=1" alt="Screenshot 2024 03 02 111225" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 6" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-02-111225.png?w=844&amp;ssl=1 844w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-02-111225.png?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-02-111225.png?resize=768%2C530&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>What was different from its predecessor, the <strong>SM2259XT</strong>, which had <strong>4 channels</strong> and <strong>4 C.E</strong>. supporting a maximum of <strong>16 dies</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>DRAM Cache or H.M.B.</strong><br/></p>
<p>Every top-of-the-line SSD aiming to deliver consistent high performance requires a buffer to store its mapping tables (<em><strong>Flash Translation Layer</strong></em> or <em><strong>Look-up table</strong></em>). This enables better random performance and responsiveness.</p>
<p>Being a DRAM-Less SATA SSD, it doesn’t support Host Memory Buffer (HMB) technology.</p>
<p><strong>NAND Flash</strong><br/></p>
<p>Regarding its storage integrated circuits, the 500GB SSD has 2 NAND flash chips labeled “<strong>NY240</strong>,” which when decoded yield the NANDs “<strong>MT29F2T08GELCEJ4-QU:C</strong>” from the American manufacturer <strong>Micron</strong>, model <strong>N48R Media Grade</strong>. In this case, they are 1Tb (128GiB) dies containing 176 layers of data and a total of 195 gates, resulting in an array efficiency of 90.2%.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ssd-crucial-bx500-500gb-nand-flash.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="332" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ssd-crucial-bx500-500gb-nand-flash.jpg?resize=720%2C332&amp;ssl=1" alt="ssd crucial bx500 500gb nand flash" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 7" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>In this SSD, each NAND Flash contains 2 dies with 1Tb of density, totaling 256GB per NAND, resulting in a total of 500GB. They communicate with the controller using a bus speed of <strong>262.5 MHz</strong> (<strong>525 MT/s</strong>), which is considerably below what the NANDs are capable of. These <strong>N48R </strong>dies are capable of operating at <strong>800 MHz</strong> (<strong>1600 MT/s</strong>).</p>
<p>There are several reasons why they might be running so low, such as the manufacturer opting to reduce power consumption and heat. Or even this batch of NAND Flash not being able to pass Micron’s Quality Control at higher frequencies and ends up being sold cheaper or perhaps has a lower endurance as well, which generally results in lower NAND costs, enabling SSDs like this to have a very low price.</p>
<p><strong>SOFTWARE UTILIZED FOR THIS PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>As this is a <strong>Silicon Motion</strong> controller, we will be using a mass production tool from them, known as <strong>MPTools</strong>. It’s worth noting that these softwares are <strong>NOT</strong> provided by the manufacturers but are LEAKED by individuals with access, and posted on Russian or Chinese forums.</p>

<p>For this project, we will use the “<strong>SMI SM2259XT2 MPTool FIMN48 V0304A FWV0303B0</strong>“, which needs to be compatible with both the controller and the NAND Flash, and this tool allows us to do that.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="379" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2.png?resize=720%2C379&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 2" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 9" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2.png?resize=1024%2C539&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2.png?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2.png?resize=768%2C404&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2.png?resize=1200%2C632&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2.png?w=1366&amp;ssl=1 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>Before making any modifications, we need to retrieve certain parameters from the SSD to preserve them. These values in the software are a preset from another SSD that may have different parameters. We need to obtain the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flash IO Driving with it’s subivisons</li>
<li>Flash Control Driving</li>
<li>Flash DQS/Data Driving</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters use hexadecimal values and must be changed according to the desired speed that we will configure for the SSD.</p>
<p>We also have many more parameters such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control ODT (On-die Termination)</li>
<li>Flash ODT (On-die Termination)</li>
<li>Schmitt Window Trigger</li>
</ul>
<p>To get these parameters, we need to go to the main screen of <strong>MPTools </strong>as shown below:</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-3.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="456" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-3.png?resize=720%2C456&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 3" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 10" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-3.png?w=1014&amp;ssl=1 1014w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-3.png?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-3.png?resize=768%2C486&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>And then we’ll click on “Scan,” which will scan all compatible disks in the system:</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-4.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="259" height="245" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-4.png?resize=259%2C245&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 4" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 11" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>After this, the SSD will be shown on port 1 if everything has gone smoothly so far, remembering that it’s not necessary to put the SSD in <strong>Safe Mode/ROM Mode</strong> yet.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-5.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="216" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-5.png?resize=720%2C216&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 5" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 12" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-5.png?w=1009&amp;ssl=1 1009w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-5.png?resize=300%2C90&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-5.png?resize=768%2C230&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>Now we double-click on this Blue Name “<strong>Ready (FW: M6CR061, MN48R)</strong>“, which, when clicked twice, will open this new screen with SSD information.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-6.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-6.png?resize=720%2C495&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 6" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 13" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-6.png?w=843&amp;ssl=1 843w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-6.png?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-6.png?resize=768%2C527&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>Then we should click on both Card mode and CID Settings to see all the parameters that the SSD comes with from the factory.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.png?resize=720%2C495&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 7" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 14" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.png?w=843&amp;ssl=1 843w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.png?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.png?resize=768%2C527&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>After noting these parameters, we also see here the speed of the controller and the NAND, which for the sake of a fair comparison, we will leave at these same frequencies.</p>

<p><strong>Applying Configurations</strong></p>
<p>Initially, we should click on the “Edit Config” button in the top right corner, and the default password is “space 2x,” which is literally ” “.</p>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-06-142821.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="517" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-06-142821.png?resize=720%2C517&amp;ssl=1" alt="Screenshot 2024 03 06 142821" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 17" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-06-142821.png?w=997&amp;ssl=1 997w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-06-142821.png?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-06-142821.png?resize=768%2C552&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure>
<p>After enabling the options to configure the SSD, let’s start by giving a name to this project. In the “<strong>Model Name:</strong>” field, we’ll enter the name that the SSD will have. This one was named “<strong>SSD SLC Test</strong>.”</p>
<p>Next, we’ll add a <strong>tag </strong>to this new firmware. In the red rectangle number 3, we’ll go to the “<strong>Firmware Version:</strong>” field and enter whatever we desire. I used “<strong>SSD-SLC</strong>” as an example.</p>
<p>Next, we arrive at one of the most crucial parts, the section on signal integrity, as all these other parameters are sensitive and must be adjusted precisely.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the top 2 parameters, “<strong>Flash Control Driving (hex)</strong>” and “<strong>Flash DQS/Data Driving (Hex)</strong>“. As we saw in the previous images, these parameters come with values of 66 in hexadecimal, so we will keep them. These 2 parameters can be found in the images below:</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-8.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="329" height="270" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-8.png?resize=329%2C270&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 8" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 18" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-8.png?w=329&amp;ssl=1 329w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-8.png?resize=300%2C246&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>After configuring these 2, let’s move on to the frequencies. As we can see in the image below, we take these 2 values and set them. The CPU in this software came by default at 500 MHz while the NAND at 250 MHz. The NAND will increase the clock slightly and the CPU will decrease, I will not overclock here for a fair comparison. Next, we’ll leave the Output driving at 03H, which is the signal closest to 04H that the SSD had.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-10.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="327" height="269" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-10.png?resize=327%2C269&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 10" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 19" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-10.png?w=327&amp;ssl=1 327w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-10.png?resize=300%2C247&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>Next, we have the last 3 settings to resolve: <strong>Flash ODT</strong>, <strong>Control ODT</strong>, and <strong>Schmitt Window.</strong> In this case, we apply the values circled in red in each of these parameters in their respective fields.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-16.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="327" height="271" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-16.png?resize=327%2C271&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 16" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 20" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-16.png?w=327&amp;ssl=1 327w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-16.png?resize=300%2C249&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>Good, here we have reached the end of another stage of this procedure. And we begin the next following step, which is the modification of the software. Because by default, this version of MPTools would not support this modification.</p>
<p>Initially, we need to go to the directory of this program in the “<strong>UFD_MP</strong>” folder located in the root directory.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-19.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="661" height="499" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-19.png?resize=661%2C499&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 19" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 21" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-19.png?w=661&amp;ssl=1 661w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-19.png?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-19.png?resize=200%2C150&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>Inside this folder, we should look for the file named “<strong>Setting.set</strong>,” which is a configuration file of <strong>MPTools</strong>. Let’s open it using the Windows Notepad.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-20.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="636" height="341" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-20.png?resize=636%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 20" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 22" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-20.png?w=636&amp;ssl=1 636w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-20.png?resize=300%2C161&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>With the file open, we’ll make 2 modifications, the first one being in the section “<strong>[Function]</strong>“, where we have the configuration named “<strong>ENFWTAG=1</strong>,” which we should change its logical level from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>0</strong>.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-22.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="560" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-22.png?resize=720%2C560&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 22" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 23" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-22.png?w=948&amp;ssl=1 948w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-22.png?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-22.png?resize=768%2C597&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>The other configuration is in the category “<strong>[Option]</strong>“, where we will add one more extra command line. This command is as follows: “<strong>EnSLCMode=1</strong>“. So after that, we save the file and reopen the MPTools.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-23.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="456" height="240" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-23.png?resize=456%2C240&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 23" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 24" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-23.png?w=456&amp;ssl=1 456w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-23.png?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>With MPTools open, we can see that in the “<strong>Select Procedure</strong>” section, there is now an option called “<strong>Force SLC Mode</strong>“, which we should check. But let’s take it easy because we haven’t finished the modifications yet. There’s no point in trying to write this new firmware to the SSD if it’s still going to operate in its native mode, whether it’s TLC or QLC.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-24.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="371" height="208" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-24.png?resize=371%2C208&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 24" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 25" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-24.png?w=371&amp;ssl=1 371w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-24.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-24.png?resize=520%2C292&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-24.png?resize=1000%2C562&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>Now we’ve reached the crucial part that enables all these modifications we’ve made to become possible. We need to take the boot and firmware initialization files from a folder within MPTools and place these files in another directory of the program.</p>
<p>First, we return to the default directory of MPTools and open the “<strong>Firmware</strong>” folder within the software.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-25.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="648" height="502" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-25.png?resize=648%2C502&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 25" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 26" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-25.png?w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-25.png?resize=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>Inside this folder, we will find one named “<strong>2259</strong>,” which refers to the <strong>SM2259XT2 </strong>controller of this SSD. Within this folder, there should be another folder named “<strong>IMN48</strong>” along with a configuration file and parameters file.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-27.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="424" height="120" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-27.png?resize=424%2C120&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 27" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 27" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-27.png?w=424&amp;ssl=1 424w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-27.png?resize=300%2C85&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>Once again, we enter this <strong>IMN48 </strong>folder, where we will encounter numerous files and folders.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-29.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="636" height="163" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-29.png?resize=636%2C163&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 29" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 28" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-29.png?w=636&amp;ssl=1 636w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-29.png?resize=300%2C77&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>Let’s move forward and open the “<strong>00</strong>” folder, then select all the files and folders within the “<strong>00</strong>” folder.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-31.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="641" height="238" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-31.png?resize=641%2C238&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 31" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 29" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-31.png?w=641&amp;ssl=1 641w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-31.png?resize=300%2C111&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>We will “<strong>copy</strong>” (not cut) to the previous folder, the “<strong>00</strong>” folder, which should look like the following image:</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-33.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="648" height="351" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-33.png?resize=648%2C351&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 33" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 30" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-33.png?w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-33.png?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>And then we should enter the “<strong>XT2</strong>” folder and copy this single file inside it called “<strong>BootISP2259.bin</strong>” to this “<strong>00</strong>” directory as shown in the next image.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-35.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="644" height="381" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-35.png?resize=644%2C381&amp;ssl=1" alt="image 35" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 31" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-35.png?w=644&amp;ssl=1 644w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-35.png?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>Next, we’ll copy all these files from the folder and paste them into the previous “<strong>2259</strong>” directory as shown in the following image:</p>

<p><strong>IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS PROCEDURE WITH THESE FILES IS FOR THIS KIT OF SM2259XT2 + NANDS N48R.</strong></p>
<p><strong>OTHER SSDS WITH DIFFERENT NANDS FOLLOW THE SAME PROCEDURE, BUT WITH DIFFERENT FOLDER NAMES. THE N48 FOLDERS WILL BE NAMED ACCORDING TO THE NAND MANUFACTURER, AS SHOWN IN THE EXAMPLE BELOW OF AN SSD WITH SM2259XT2 CONTROLLER + KIOXIA BiCS5 NANDs.</strong></p>

<p>If everything is correct, let’s go to the “<strong>Test</strong>” section next to “<strong>Parameter</strong>,” which is the program’s main screen. Now we should put the SSD into ROM mode. Let’s close the software again.</p>
<h3 id="softwares-do-ssd"><strong>HOW MUCH DID THE ENDURANCE INCREASED?</strong></h3>
<p>To calculate durability precisely, we need the following information:</p>
<p><strong>Write Amplification Factor</strong></p>
<p><strong>NAND: Program/Erase Cycle</strong></p>
<p><strong>SSD’s Capacity</strong></p>
<p>With these 3 parameters, we can have a basic understanding of TBW (Terabytes Written), but remember that it’s an approximate value. For a more precise calculation, following the <strong>JEDEC JESD218A</strong> parameters would be necessary, which includes more complicated parameters like <strong>Wear-Leveling Efficiency</strong> (<strong>W.L.E.</strong>).</p>
<p>Using this basic calculation with the SSD in its default mode, we see that it has a <strong>TBW</strong> of <strong>120TB</strong>, with a <strong>Program/Erase Cycle</strong> of these <strong>Media Grade N48R</strong> NANDs around <strong>900 P.E.C</strong>. And how do I know this? I managed to access the datasheet of the NANDs. Taking this into consideration, we can reach the conclusion below, considering the calculation:</p>
<div>

<p> <strong>120 TB (TBW) = (900 P.E.C. x 0.5 TB)</strong> </p>
<p> <strong>X = 3.75 W.A.F.</strong></p>
<p>We see that based on this, the SSD’s WAF in its native form would be quite high, in the range of 3.75, when tested in practical scenarios it was close to 3.8 WAF.</p>
<p>Now, in pSLC mode, the parameters change. The NAND from this Die can withstand up to <strong>60,000 P/E</strong> <strong>cycles</strong> according to the datasheet, and its capacity drops to 0.12TB (120GB). When I randomly tested the SSD, I noticed that its WAF was below 2, which improved significantly.</p>
<p><strong> </strong> <strong>X TB (TBW) = (60.000 P.E.C. x 0.12 TB)</strong> </p>
<p><strong>X = 4000 TB (TBW)</strong></p>
<p>We see that the TBW has increased drastically, from <strong>120TB</strong>(500GB QLC) to <strong>4,000TB</strong> (120GB pSLC), which is an increase of over 3333%, more than 3000 percent.</p>

<p>In these sequential scenarios, the difference is basically nonexistent because even with the pSLC Cache, the SSD already reaches its maximum bandwidth and the manufacturer’s sequential speeds. Not to mention that this is a quick test; in a more extensive and heavy benchmark, we will see that there will indeed be a difference.</p>

<p>In terms of latency, there was indeed a considerable drop because when the SSD is in Idle, its NANDs, when they start to write or “read,” are in native mode, which would be QLC, and until they are reprogrammed to SLC, they have a certain latency. However, with the SSD in full pSLC mode, this latency is much lower because it always stays in pSLC mode.</p>

<p>The same happens with its random speeds; we can see that there was a greater difference in these benchmarks compared to sequential speed, where the difference was almost negligible.</p>

<p>The same happens at QD1; we can see that in reading, the SSD had an increase of over 16% in its speeds, while in writing, there was a much larger increase of over 30%.</p>

<p>The ATTO Disk Benchmark is a software that performs a sequential speed test with compressed files. Therefore, for a simulation under a data transfer load like in Windows, we typically see block sizes ranging from 128KB to 1MB. Now, we observe that the SSD in pSLC mode outperforms the SSD in its factory mode across all block sizes, which is impressive once again.</p>

<p>In this benchmark focusing more on casual environments, we can see that even here, in a scenario fully representative of reality, there is indeed a performance difference, especially in latency. Although it may not be something entirely noticeable in everyday use in these “lighter” scenarios.</p>

<p>In this scenario, which is a practical benchmark with a slightly greater focus on writing than 3DMark, as it is more productivity-oriented, it’s possible to notice the practical difference in day-to-day use. The difference was striking, almost twice the performance.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Premiere Pro 2021</strong></p>
<p>Next, we used Adobe Premiere to measure the average time it takes to open a project of about 16.5GB with 4K resolution, 120Mbps bitrate, and full of effects until it was ready for editing. It’s worth noting that the tested SSD is always used as a secondary drive without the operating system installed, as this could affect the results, leading to inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Here we can see that, as it is more of a scenario of sequential data reading from the project, the difference was almost negligible, just a variation between runs.</p>
<p><strong>WINDOWS BOOT TIME AND GAME LOADING TIME</strong></p>
<p>We compared the SSD with pSLC Cache and in pSLC Mode using the Final Fantasy XIV benchmark.</p>

<p>The same happens with game loading times because the limitation lies in the game’s API, which differs from <strong>DirectStorage</strong>. This API is not optimized for us to feel a significant difference.</p>

<p>The same can be said for Windows, as although it is a completely new system, it cannot take advantage of features like the one we applied to the SSD.</p>
<p><strong>SLC CACHING</strong></p>
<p>A large part of SSDs on the market currently utilize SLC Caching technology, where a certain percentage of their storage capacity, whether it’s MLC (2 bits per cell), TLC (3 bits per cell), or QLC (4 bits per cell), is used to store only 1 bit per cell. In this case, it’s used as a write and read buffer, where the controller starts writing, and when the buffer is depleted, it writes to the native NAND Flash (MLC/TLC/QLC).</p>

<p>Through IOmeter, we can get an idea of the SLC cache volume of this SSD, as manufacturers often do not provide this information. Based on the tests we conducted, it was found that it has a pSLC cache volume that appears to be dynamic, relatively small, around <strong>45GB</strong>. It managed to maintain an average speed of approximately <strong>493MB/s </strong>until the end of the buffer, which is a good speed considering it is a SATA SSD.</p>
<p>However, after writing <strong>45GB</strong>, it begins to enter the folding process because it allocated all its capacity to work as pSLC. So now we see the true Achilles’ heel of QLC SSDs. Its sustained speed was quite low, averaging around <strong>50 MB/s</strong>.</p>
<div>

<p>Now, when we transform this SSD into <strong>pSLC</strong>, we see that it writes to its full capacity of 120GB at an average of <strong>498 MB/s</strong>. And to confirm, we wrote up to 500GB to the SSD, and even then, it continued rewriting its capacity more than 4 times at almost <strong>500 MB/s</strong>.</p>
<div>

<p>As we can see in the graph above, we averaged the SSD’s write speed, combining the speed within the pSLC Cache + Folding + Native. Taking this into account, we see that the difference was striking, almost 10 times higher.</p>
<p><strong>FILE COPY TEST</strong></p>
<p>In this test, the ISO files and CSGO were copied from a RAM Disk to the SSD to see how it performs. The Windows 10 21H1 ISO of 6.25GB (1 file) and the CSGO installation folder of 25.2GB were used.</p>

<p>In a more realistic test like this, we can see that there is no difference because the SLC cache volume of the SSD natively is larger than the size of the tested file.</p>
<div>

<p>And even when using a larger folder, it is still smaller than the volume of the SSD’s SLC cache. I don’t test with larger files because I use a RAM Disk, and since I only have “<strong>32GB</strong>” to make a larger RAM Disk, I would need more RAM.</p>
<p><strong>TEMPERATURE TEST</strong></p>
<p>In this part of the analysis, we will observe the temperature of the SSD during a stress test, where the SSD receives files continuously, to determine if there was any <strong><em>thermal throttling</em></strong> with its internal components that could cause a bottleneck or loss of performance.</p>

<p>The SSD doesn’t even heat up because it’s a low-power consumption SSD, as we’ll see throughout the analysis, and I believe this sensor to be the NAND Flash sensor.</p>
<p><strong>POWER CONSUMPTION AND EFFICIENCY</strong></p>
<p>SSDs, like many other components in our system, have a certain power consumption. The most efficient ones can perform tasks quickly with relatively low power consumption, allowing them to transition back to idle power states where they consume less energy.</p>
<div>

<p>In this section of the analysis, we will use the Quarch Programmable Power Module provided by Quarch Solutions (pictured above) to conduct tests and determine how efficient the SSD is. This methodology involves conducting three tests: measuring the maximum power consumption of the SSD, calculating an average power consumption in practical and casual scenarios, and measuring power consumption during idle periods.</p>
<p>This set of tests, especially those related to efficiency and idle power consumption, is important for users who intend to use SSDs in laptops. SSDs spend the vast majority of their time in low-power states (idle), so understanding their power consumption characteristics can significantly impact battery life and overall energy efficiency.</p>

<p>We can see that thanks to this modification, its efficiency has increased dramatically. This occurred because, although the difference in power consumption was not as significant as we will see shortly, the speed in MB/s was extremely high. </p>
<p>Due to the benchmark exceeding the SSD’s <strong>45GB </strong>cache by a large margin, it spent a significant portion of the test at a very low speed of less than<strong> 55 MB/s</strong>, resulting in low efficiency. In pSLC mode, it was able to write twice its capacity at even lower power consumption than in QLC mode, and its bandwidth did not drop at any point. This led to the significant difference in power consumption.</p>

<p>Although this SSD naturally has low power consumption, we do observe a decrease when transforming it into pSLC mode. This occurs because SLC NANDs have only 2 logical levels, meaning the <strong>threshold voltage </strong>required to allow electrons to flow in the gate channel of each cell is lower since there are fewer levels needed to represent binary 1 or 0. In contrast, QLC NANDs have 16 logical levels, requiring a higher <strong>threshold voltage</strong>. This explains the reduction in power consumption.</p>

<p>Once again, we see this in the average of both SSDs.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image059.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="503" src="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image059.jpg?resize=720%2C503&amp;ssl=1" alt="image059" title="Tutorial: Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD - Dramatically increasing the drive&#39;s endurance! 68" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image059.jpg?resize=1024%2C716&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image059.jpg?resize=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image059.jpg?resize=768%2C537&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image059.jpg?resize=1200%2C839&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/theoverclockingpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image059.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>
<p>Last but not least, the Idle test, which represents the scenario where the vast majority of SSDs are in everyday use. Here we can see that it had even lower consumption in Idle. Another positive point.</p>
<p>What can we conclude from this?</p>
<p>Once again, I stress the importance of caution with this procedure as it can indeed go wrong if not done correctly. However, we see that the differences are significant in some scenarios while more subtle in others. But now, in terms of durability, the difference is immense!</p>
