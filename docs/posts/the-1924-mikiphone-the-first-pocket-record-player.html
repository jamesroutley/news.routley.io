<p>This wonder of the past was called the Mikiphone, a pocket-sized phonograph that let you carry your favorite tunes wherever you went.</p>
<p>The Mikiphone, a portable phonograph small enough to fit in one’s pocket, was the brainchild of Hungarian siblings Miklós and Étienne Vadász.</p>
<p>It entered mass production under a licensing agreement with Maison Paillard, based in Saint Croix, Switzerland.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mikiphone-02.webp" alt="Mikiphone World First Pocket Record Player" width="1400"/>Maison Paillard, which traces its origins to a group of local watchmakers coming together in 1814, initially delved into crafting music boxes around 1860.</p>
<p>As the 19th century drew to a close, the company expanded its offerings to include cylinder phonographs and made a full transition to disc gramophones by 1905. Notably, in 1913, Paillard introduced an electric AC gramophone motor.</p>
<p>From 1927 onward, the company expanded its portfolio to include electric amplifiers for gramophones and later ventured into radio equipment production.</p>
<p>Amidst these milestones, Maison Paillard manufactured approximately 180,000 units of the Vadász brothers’ Mikiphones.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mikiphone-09.webp" alt="Mikiphone World First Pocket Record Player" width="1400"/>In contrast to today’s modern music devices, the Mikiphone operated without batteries, instead relying on a hand-crank for power. Its sound was amplified through a resonator.</p>
<p>At first glance, the closed Mikiphone appears quite compact, easily fitting inside a purse.</p>
<p>However, it requires some assembly, with its components stored within the case, which, when shut, measures just 11.5 cm in diameter and 4.7 cm in thickness.</p>
<p>The recording head and a two-piece Bakelite resonator had to be connected to the foldout tone arm before the shellac disc could be placed on the turntable’s central pin.</p>
<p>This precision engineering feat was awarded first prize at an international music exhibition in Geneva in 1927.</p>
<p>When fully assembled, the Mikiphone takes up a considerable amount of room and it was primarily designed to play 10-inch records.</p>
<p>This made it more of an entertainment device suitable for gatherings rather than a portable companion for your everyday errands.</p>
