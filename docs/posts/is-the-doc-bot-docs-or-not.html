    <h1>Is the doc bot docs, or not?</h1>

<p>Upgrading my <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/simple-shopify-emails/?utm_source=Robin_Sloan_sent_me">Shopify email noti­fi­ca­tion templates</a> this morning, I asked Shopify’s LLM-powered devel­oper doc­u­men­ta­tion bot this ques­tion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s the syntax, in Liquid, to detect whether an order in an email noti­fi­ca­tion con­tains items that will be ful­filled through Shopify Collective?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d done a few tra­di­tional searches, but couldn’t find an answer, so I thought, okay, let’s try the doc bot!</p>
<p>The reply came, quick and clean:</p>
<pre>{% if order.tags contains &#39;Shopify Collective&#39; %}
  &lt;!-- The order contains at least one item fulfilled through Shopify Collective --&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some items in your order are being fulfilled by a partner merchant through Shopify Collective.&lt;/p&gt;
{% endif %}
</pre>
<p>Looks great. I added this code, but it didn’t work; the con­di­tion wasn’t being satisfied, even when orders had the nec­es­sary tag, vis­ible on the admin screen.</p>
<p>Shopify doesn’t pro­vide a way to test uncon­ven­tional email for­mats without actu­ally placing real orders, so I did my cus­tomary dance of order-refund, order-refund, order-refund. My credit card is going to get locked one of these days.</p>
<p>Turns out, the <code>Shopify Collective</code> tag isn’t present on the order at the time the con­fir­ma­tion email is generated. It’s added later, pos­sibly just moments later, by some other cryptic Shopify process.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is doc­u­mented anywhere, so in that sense, it’s not sur­prising the doc­u­men­ta­tion bot got it wrong. My ques­tion is: what’s the point of a doc bot that just takes a guess?</p>
<p>More point­edly: is the doc bot docs, or not?</p>
<p>And very point­edly indeed: what are we even doing here??</p>
<p>I’ve sent other queries to the doc bot and received helpful replies; I’d cat­e­go­rize these basi­cally as search: “How do I do X?” “What’s the syntax for Y?” But I believe this is a sit­u­a­tion in which the cost of bad advice out­weighs the ben­efit of quick help by 10X, at least. I can, in fact, figure out how to do X using the real docs. Only the doc bot can make things up.</p>
<p>If it was Claude making this kind of mistake, I’d be annoyed but not surprised. But this is Shopify’s sanc­tioned helper! It waits twin­kling in the header of every page of the dev site. I suppose there are domains in which just taking a guess is okay; is the offi­cial doc­u­men­ta­tion one of them?</p>
<p>I vote no, and I think a freestyling doc bot under­mines the effort and care of the folks at Shopify taking the time to write doc­u­men­ta­tion that is thor­ough and accurate.</p>
<p>P.S. In the end, I adapted the code from the item listing part of the <span>noti­fi­ca­tion — </span><wbr/>a bit circuitous, but it works:</p>
<pre>{% assign is_collective_order = false %}
{% for line_item in line_items %}
  {% if line_item.product.tags contains &#39;Shopify Collective&#39; %}
    {% assign is_collective_order = true %}
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</pre>
