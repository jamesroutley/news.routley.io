The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/politics/trumps-crypto-venture-divides-the-industry-he-aims-to-support.html" title="">memecoin</a> the president introduced during pre-inaugural festivities in January, called $Trump, spurred controversy because it swung wildly in value and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/trump-crypto-memecoin.html" title="">generated hefty trading fees</a> for Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The S.E.C.’s policy statement did not refer to Mr. Trump’s memecoin or any other specific digital novelty item. But the commission clearly acknowledged the risk to investors who put money into such products, even as it said it would not regulate them.</p><p>“Although the offer and sale of memecoins may not be subject to the federal securities laws, fraudulent conduct related to the offer and sale of memecoins may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies,” said the statement, from the S.E.C.’s division of corporation finance.</p><p>In reaching its conclusion, the S.E.C. employed a nearly century-old Supreme Court decision to determine that a memecoin should not be considered an investment contract and therefore subject to regulatory oversight.</p><p>Under Gary Gensler, who served as S.E.C. chair under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the regulator had used that same Supreme Court case to argue that most digital assets are securities and subject to regulation.</p><p>The S.E.C., apparently worried that traders and speculators could use its rationale to evade regulation, said it would look closely at any new product that tried to label itself a “memecoin.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The agency has moved quickly to dismantle the aggressive approach taken by Mr. Gensler in regulating cryptocurrencies. His enforcement actions angered the crypto industry and led many of its investors to contribute mightily to the campaign of Mr. Trump, who at one time was a crypto critic.</p><p>Also on Thursday, the S.E.C. officially moved to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/technology/coinbase-sec-lawsuit.html" title="">dismiss its enforcement lawsuit against Coinbase,</a> one of the nation&#39;s largest crypto firms. The S.E.C. also has told a number of crypto companies that it was ending investigations into their activities.</p><p>The S.E.C. also said in a court filing this week that it was trying to reach a settlement in a civil fraud case it filed against Justin Sun, a crypto investor. Mr. Sun also is an adviser to World Liberty and a significant investor in its digital token. The charges against him do not involve his investment with World Liberty.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
