        How much do you think it costs to make a pair of Nike shoes in Asia? </p></div>
      <p>
        In 2014, Steve Bence served as Nike&#39;s Program Director in Footwear Sourcing and Manufacturing. He pulled back the curtain on manufacturing in an interview with Portland Business Journal. He said that, if a sneaker retails for $100, it generally costs them about $25 to manufacture <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC1LR5bYAACcaR.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC1LR5bYAACcaR.png"/></a></span>

      <p>
        This is the FOB cost. In the industry, &#34;free on board&#34; is the shoe&#39;s cost at the point when it&#39;s loaded onto a vessel at the port of origin. &#34;Free&#34; refers to how the factory will pay to deliver a finished product up to the point when it boards a ship—the rest is your problem. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC5PvvaoAEtxp3.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC5PvvaoAEtxp3.jpg"/></a></span>
        <sup><i></i></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Tariffs are calculated on the declared value of the import. In this imaginary case, if Nike paid a factory $25 to produce a pair of sneakers, then their tariff cost is $26. This roughly doubles the cost of making a pair of shoes in Asia and bringing it into the US (landed cost). <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC1vfrbwAE0EPN.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC1vfrbwAE0EPN.png"/></a></span>

        &#34;OK,&#34; you say, &#34;so that leaves them with a $49 profit. $100 retail minus $25 manufacturing cost and $26 tariff. That&#39;s still good.&#34; </p></div>
      <p>
        In 2016, Sole Review took a look at Nike&#39;s income statement and came up with this breakdown. On an imaginary $100 shoe, they estimate manufacturing cost is $22. Add freight, insurance, and import taxes, they estimate it costs Nike $27 to bring that shoe from Asia to the US. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC3qwUbwAAdd5b.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC3qwUbwAAdd5b.jpg"/></a></span>

      <div id="tweet_7" data-controller="thread" data-action="click-&gt;thread#showTweet" data-screenname="dieworkwear" data-tweet="1909741181757800851" dir="auto"><p>
        They also looked at Footlocker&#39;s income statement/ 10k filing and came up with this model. On the same imaginary $100 shoe, Footlocker makes $6 after expenses. </p></div>
      <div id="tweet_8" data-controller="thread" data-action="click-&gt;thread#showTweet" data-screenname="dieworkwear" data-tweet="1909741183934595155" dir="auto"><p>
        The actual costs associated with shoes will vary depending on the design, sourcing, and other specifics. The imaginary shoe above is set at $100 to make things easier as a percentage. For completeness, you can read Sole Review&#39;s story here:</p></div>
      <div id="tweet_9" data-controller="thread" data-action="click-&gt;thread#showTweet" data-screenname="dieworkwear" data-tweet="1909741185956299248" dir="auto"><p>
        From this model, you can see a few things. </p></div>
      <p>
        But if we bump the cost of freight, insurance, and customs from $5 to, say, $28, then they wholesale the shoes to Footlocker for about $75. And if Footlocker purchases Nike shoes for $75, then they retail them for $150. Everyone needs to fixed percentages to avoid losses. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC8_wtb0AAr-z1.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC8_wtb0AAr-z1.jpg"/></a></span>

      <p>
        The second thing we see is that Asian manufacturing in Asia produces US jobs. You go to Footlocker to buy a pair of $100 shoes because you can afford them. This creates jobs for the Footlocker employees, Nike designers, marketing teams, and other US people throughout this chain. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC9eB8bwAMtidR.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC9eB8bwAMtidR.jpg"/></a></span>

      <p>
        The third thing we see is that Nike only paid the factory about $25 to make these sneakers. How much did it cost the factory to produce them? I don&#39;t have numbers on that, but if we assume the usual turnkey model, then maybe $12.5? And how much of that went to the worker? <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC-LjVbwAILWod.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC-LjVbwAILWod.jpg"/></a></span>

        Again, it&#39;s a popular misconception that all overseas production is sweatshops. Production can be done ethically abroad and still be relatively cheap because the cost of living is not the same everywhere. I encourage you to note assume that every Asian worker is a slave.

        We have some idea of how much it would cost to make sneakers in the US. Victory/ Hersey (before they closed), SAS, and certain New Balances are made here. They retail for about $220.</p></div>
      <p>
        I think making shoes is a perfectly fine job, although it suffers from the same problem as other manufacturing jobs. As the US has switched to a post-industrial economy, a lot of the wage growth has been in knowledge intensive services—medicine, law, engineering.
        <sup><i></i></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        That means the Nike designer and marketer typically see more wage growth year-after-year than someone working on the manufacturing line (especially if they&#39;re not unionized and can leverage collective bargaining power). <span><span><span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoDA0EzbwAU0vRx.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoDA0EzbwAU0vRx.jpg"/></a></span></span></span>

        Tech optimists think that technology will make factory jobs easier and better for workers. I&#39;m less sanguine. I think some tech improves productivity and wages; other types of tech deskills and eliminates jobs (look at AI with illustration art).</p></div>
      <p>
        I raise this only because I see some people suggest that it only costs Nike $2 to make a pair of sneakers in Asian sweatshops, which retail on the shelf for $150, and this is $148 profit. And if we move this back to the US, American workers can capture some of that money.
        <sup><i></i></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the truth is much more complicated. Manufacturing overseas can create certain jobs here by offering a more affordable product. In the end, you may actually see a *loss* of US jobs as fewer people pay for $220 sneakers, both at home and abroad. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoDCJMZbwAE-usv.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoDCJMZbwAE-usv.jpg"/></a></span>
