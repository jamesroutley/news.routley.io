      </p>
      <p>
        A brief tutorial on taking and manipulating screenshots, so that you can quickly have fun making motivational quote images, custom Zulip/Slack emojis, templated memes, goofy “photoshop” composites, and whatever else your heart
        desires.

      <p>If you remember one thing from this post, let it be that there is a shortcut for copying a selected region on your screen:</p>
      <div>
        <table>
          <colgroup>
            <col/>
            <col/>
            <col/>
          </colgroup>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>
                OS<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
              </th>
              <th>Copy selection to your clipboard</th>
              <th>Save selection to a file</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Mac</strong></td>
              <td><code>command + control + shift + 4</code></td>
              <td><code>command + shift + 4</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Windows</strong></td>
              <td><code>windows logo + shift + s</code></td>
              <td><code>windows logo + shift + s</code>, then select “save”</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>
        Hit the selected key combination, then draw a box on your screen around whatever you want to be in the screenshot. That’s it! If you used the “save” option, it’ll save to wherever your default save location is (e.g., your desktop or
        documents or downloads folder); if you used the “clipboard” option, it’ll be saved into your clipboard and ready for you to paste somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>Go ahead and try it right now:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Save a screenshot of the above table to a file (now you can reference it later!)</li>
        <li>
          Copy a screenshot of that table to your clipboard, then paste it<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> somewhere: into an email, a text message to your landlord, a Slack thread, a Zoom
          chat, wherever!
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="how-to-edit-screenshots-quickly">How to edit screenshots quickly</h2>
      <p>Get familiar with your default basic image editor. I’m on Mac, so use the Preview application. Alternatively there’s this online <a href="https://jspaint.app/">MS Paint remake</a> that works pretty well.</p>
      <p>The functions you’ll want to get comfortable with are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cropping</li>
        <li>Adding text—and styling that text (resize, color, font if you’re feeling fancy)</li>
        <li>Bonus: selecting and removing background fills.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The faster you can do those actions without thinking about them, the easier it will be to respond with an image instead of with text. Here’s an example of me doing a quick edit in Preview:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/edit.gif" alt="Animated gif of editing a bee image to remove background and add text"/>
      </figure>
      <p>with output</p>

        <img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/bee.png" alt="Image of a bee overlaid with text that reads “I’m a bee”"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Go ahead and try a basic edit with your program of choice<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>:
      </p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Save a screenshot of a portion of your screen</li>
        <li>Open it in your image editor</li>
        <li>Crop it into a thin rectangle</li>
        <li>Add a line of text that says “hello, I did this” and then turn the text purple and make it fill the whole box.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="what-to-make">What to make?</h2>
      <p>Right, those are the basic skills: taking a screenshot, editing the screenshot. What to do with them?</p>
      <h3 id="motivational-quotes">Motivational quotes</h3>
      <p>Start with a pretty landscape; add a text box with your quote of choice.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/mistaek.png" alt="Photo of sunset over mountains, with quote reading “computer is mistaek” over top"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Especially delightful for workplace commentary.</p>
      <h3 id="traditional-templated-memes">Traditional templated memes</h3>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Using an online meme template site (e.g., <a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/X-X-Everywhere">imgflip</a>), add your text to a given template:</li>
      </ol>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/screenshots-full.png" alt="Screenshot of imgflip meme template, filled in with contents of the following meme"/>
      </figure>
      <ol start="2" type="1">
        <li><strong>Take a screenshot</strong> of the updated template. Don’t bother with the “generate meme” or “download” buttons! (They’ll try to make you sign up for stuff, and this way is quicker anyway.)</li>
      </ol>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/screenshots.png" alt="Toy Story meme with text “screenshots/screenshots everywhere”"/>
      </figure>
      <p>This use-case is especially excellent for rapid-response comments in video chats. Did you know you could paste images from your clipboard directly into a Zoom chat? You can!</p>
      <h3 id="emoji-for-slackzulipetc">Emoji for Slack/Zulip/etc</h3>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Save a screenshot of the image you want to upload.</li>
        <li>Crop it down into a square</li>
        <li>
          Bonus: use a “remove background” tool to make the background transparent. Think about whether it will show up in both dark and light modes; if not, add your own background to it first. The simpler the image, the better it will
          read from within your message application.
        </li>
        <li>Upload it into your messaging software. E.g., in Slack, within a workspace go to <code>Tools &gt; Customize Workspace &gt; Emoji</code>; in Zulip, do <code>Settings &gt; Organization &gt; Custom emoji</code>.</li>
      </ol>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/zulip.png" alt="Screenshot of three custom emojis in a Zulip message: woohoo, pickle, mirror"/>
      </figure>
      <h3 id="composite-images">Composite images</h3>
      <p>
        Save screenshots of a couple images. Open one and remove its background, then copy it into the clipboard. Open the second; paste from the clipboard over top, then resize and move the pasted image until it looks good. Note: “good”,
        not “perfect”. The goal is quick-and-good-enough, not “make it look like a professional Photoshopped this.”
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/composite.gif" alt="Animated screenshot of combining a Detroit Tigers hat and a surprise pikachu meme"/>
      </figure>
      <p>What should you make? Put a hat on your friend, put a penguin on a rollercoaster, I don’t know! Whatever suits your mood. Why? Because it is funny.</p>
      <h3 id="other-screenshot-uses">Other screenshot uses</h3>
      <p>
        My primary screenshot selection usage is actually more for taking screenshots of things I want to remember from otherwise ephemeral video call chats: charts, citations, quotes. I also keep a folder on my desktop of things that make
        me happy: comments, praise, and general goofiness from otherwise ephemeral chat situations (Zoom/Slack/group texts, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like it for responding in digital conversations—a picture is worth a thousand words, etc.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Other things I have done with a modified screenshot
        image: frame it and gift it. Put it on a puzzle and sent that puzzle to a friend. Print it in triplicate and tape it all over my team’s meeting room.
      </p>
      <h2 id="with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility">With great power comes great responsibility</h2>
      <p>It should go without saying, but it is important, so I’m going to say it anyway:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          <p><strong>Respect assumptions of privacy!</strong> E.g., no sharing Zoom screenshots of people, slides, or the chat without permission.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Be respectful in your choice of meme templates, text, and imagery.</strong> Avoid -isms (<a href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules#no-subtle-isms">subtle</a> or otherwise), inadvertent microaggressions (such as
            <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/digital-blackface-reaction-gifs">digital blackface</a>), and <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/punch-down">punching down</a>.

        and share it and move on.
