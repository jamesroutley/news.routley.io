    <h1>/u/spez is right about feudalism and that&#39;s why Reddit as we know it is doomed</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Since Elon Musk bought Twitter, people have been making a lot of comparisons between internet institutions – particularly various social media things – and premodern political forms and figures.</p>

<p>These comparisons typically rely on the level of understanding of antiquity or of medieval life you’d expect to get from <a href="https://www.dk.com/us/book/9781465481542-dkfindout-castles/">DKfindout! Castles</a>. I am not a historian, but I know, like, just about enough to be embarrassed for the speakers.</p>

<p>So in this post, I want to talk a bit about how the relevant historical phenomena worked, a bit about why feudalism tends to be a pretty bad comparison to internet stuff, and a bit about why Reddit CEO Steve Huffman is – still! – maybe more correct than he knows when he compares moderators to landed gentry… in a way that suggests the end coming for Reddit as-we-know-it<sup id="fnref:medieval" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:medieval">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="medieval-sociopolitics-in-my-blog-its-more-likely-than-you-think">Medieval sociopolitics? In <em>my</em> blog? It’s more likely than you think</h2>

<p>Feudalism is such a shit concept to work with that if you look it up in the Encyclopedia Britannica, instead of getting a history of feudalism, you get <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/feudalism">a history of the term’s use in history, how it has always been an awkward oversimplification, and how it only got muddier over time</a>. Everything I can find goes to great pains to explain that any summary you can give will erase a lot of very important variance over time and place, and that even within one state at one time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism_in_the_Holy_Roman_Empire#Types">shit could get stupid complicated</a>.</p>

<p>However! If I am to claim that internet comparisons to feudalism are bad, then I need to evaluate charitably what they might best mean, squinted at under flattering light.</p>

<p>To that end, let’s try and disentangle two parts. <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/09/23/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iia-rascally-vassals/">Bret Devereaux, actual historian</a><sup id="fnref:bret" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bret">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Veteran readers of the blog will already know that I generally avoid the terms ‘feudal’ and ‘feudalism,’ as do many medievalists these days. The problem is that ‘feudalism’ comes to conflate two very different systems: manorialism, the economic system which structured the relations between peasant farmers (mostly serfs) and their elite landlords, and vassalage, the political system which structured relations between elites. But these systems and the relationships they structured were very different and their conflation together as a single system is a modern, not medieval, construction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay. Manorialism and vassalage. This sounds doable, right?</p>

<p>Here follows sketched-out summary.</p>

<h2 id="manorialism">Manorialism</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">Premodern subsistence farmers, on their own, don’t optimize for producing a surplus, but instead on increasing their resiliency.</a><sup id="fnref:europe" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:europe">3</a></sup> This is because having a surplus – whether in goods or money – is, in their context, both more difficult and less useful than you might expect. To increase resiliency, they can employ less facially efficient farming methods that will diversify their risks, and when times are good, they can invest any small surplus in social relations.</li>
  <li><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/">Large landholders rely on the desperation of the little people to make it possible for them to secure enough borrowed/bought/forced labor to make those larger holdings produce</a>.</li>
  <li>The relationship between the small farmers and the elites is the exchange of “labor, deference and some support” for “[military or political] protection […], some access to farming capital and most importantly the implied promise that in a catastrophe the big landholder would come to the ‘rescue’.”-</li>
  <li>This relationship is largely exploitative. In many places and times, it relies on a lot of “non-free labor”. The non-free-ness of it all is enforced with violence or the threat of violence, whether state violence or not.</li>
  <li>The manorial relationship also “[serves] to reorient production away from subsistence and towards surplus” to support elite lifestyles. “[Doing] anything that isn’t farming means somehow forcing subsistence farmers to work more and harder in order to generate the surplus to provide for those people who do the activities which in turn the subsistence farmers might benefit from not at all.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vassalage">Vassalage</h2>

<p>It is with some trepidation that I will point to non-popular-history<sup id="fnref:pop" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pop">4</a></sup>, “Fiefs and vassals : the medieval evidence reinterpreted”, by Susan Reynolds<sup id="fnref:admit" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:admit">5</a></sup>. If anyone with a relevant degree wants to tell me I’m wrong in my summary or choice of source, they are welcome<sup id="fnref:google" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:google">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>She reiterates the thing about feudalism being a blob of concept that confuses more than it elucidates. She extends that to vassalage and fiefs, saying that, well, we might have hoped they would be more dependable concepts since they’re smaller in scope, but that was wrong. To the extent that we can pin down little bits of them with adequate definition, she says they aren’t as generally useful as they’ve been made out to be.</p>

<p>So in as far as we are here to make a comparison between vassalage and anything internet, it is probably fair to say that we are making it to a kind of 16th-century historical myth-narrative rather than a usefully abstracted description of real social relations.</p>

<p>Of this vassalage narrative, then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vassalage denotes the relation between a lord and his free or noble follower. This was undertaken with oath and ceremony. It obligated the lord to “protect and maintain his vassal”, and obligated the vassal to provide military aid and attend at the lord’s court. (The latter obligations were also sort of implied outside of vassalage relationships if you were otherwise propertied enough to be <em>able</em> to provide demanded knights, for instance.)</li>
  <li>It hacked a state structure into existence through personal relations when “there was [supposedly] no idea of the state and very little idea of impersonal, public obligations at all”<sup id="fnref:publica" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:publica">7</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>In the modern mind, there are nice crisp distinctions between “rent” and “tax”. This is because we like to imagine we have a crisp concept of “ownership” of land distinct from jurisdiction. In fief-holding Europe, it’s more accurate to say that the <em>classic</em> ideological structure dictates that the land belongs to God, and God says kings have charge of bits of it, and the kings say lords have charge of bits of those bits, and the lords may say various non-lords have charge of bits… Rent-y-tax-y obligations are owed back up chain, and rights-like obligations exist along it. However, this <em>idea</em> obscures that folks down the chain may often feel that their land is more meaningfully theirs by <em>custom</em> than by the higher layers’ authority, and the language in primary sources doesn’t dictate clean lines.</li>
  <li>“[In] an age of low literacy, few records, and poor communications, great men needed to use personal loyalties, ceremonies, and <em>ad hominem</em> rewards to maintain and extend their power over the land; and that, since rulers, nobles, and most free men lived off the work of a dependent peasantry, rulers could maintain, control, and reward their followers by delegating control over land and peasants to them. It also seems clear that, as collective activity became more organized, as bureaucracy developed, and as literacy increased the range and power of propaganda, so government relied less on direct interpersonal relations.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="one-more-thing-state-capacity">One more thing: state capacity</h2>

<p>There’s this book called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State">Seeing Like A State</a> by James C. Scott. If you’re not in the mood to read it, read <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">the first chunk of this blog post</a>, but mentally credit it with a bunch of examples Rao doesn’t include in the summary. This section is kind of cribbed from parts of it.</p>

<p>So – why did our mythically-feudal king need vassals, if other states didn’t always have them?</p>

<p>A state needs revenue, and in the premodern era, that’s got to come “mainly from levies on commerce and land, the major sources of wealth.” This turns out to be at least as complicated as taxes today, if for very different reasons. Knowing <em>from a distance</em> what taxes you should demand is hard. Take too little, and your state is feeble. Take too much, and you’ll have a whole new set of problems: flight, resistance, etc.</p>

<p>The local systems of measurement may vary from tiny place to tiny place – and even if you have more abstract ones to hand, local practices and land quality may mean that “two acres” in one place might acceptably be taxed far more highly than in another. So you can see why there was so much pressure to standardize the measures in the early modern era, right?</p>

<p>But it wasn’t <em>just</em> the measures getting standardized – it was also the rights people had.</p>

<p>Scott gives an example amalgamated from Southeast Asian practices. You might have land that’s parceled out among families during the main growing season, but reparceled out every seven years. After the main-season crop is harvested, then everything is common land, so anybody in the village gets to graze their animals and plant dry-season crops. But you might only be allowed to graze a certain number of animals, and that right might be transferable among the villagers, but not to outsiders. You might get to gather firewood for your own use but not for commercial sale – customs where fruit belongs to the family who planted a tree, even if not on their current parcel, but <em>fallen</em> fruit is fair game for anyone – rules about who gets branches that broke off of trees in storms… Rules “riven with inequalities based on gender, status, and lineage.”…</p>

<p>And <em>all</em> of this varying wildly from place to place.</p>

<p>Now: how could you as the king figure out how much rent-tax to demand directly from each of these people? Maybe you can figure out to some approximation the overall productivity of the overall land associated with the community, but actually extracting resources has to come from these households, right? And none of the inequalities are clear to you as an outsider – and <em>everyone will lie to you</em> and to your representatives because <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICUwC-f8iYg">fuck tha rent</a></em>.</p>

<p>And do you have the <em>capacity</em> to go around enforcing all this? To send people from your royal court out to each little hamlet, figure out how much to demand, and punish those who don’t meet the demand?</p>

<p>This points to an important function of the local feudal hierarchy, looked at from the perspective of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capacity">state capacity</a>. If the vassal is around in the community to be able to figure out the local practices and maximize the rent-tax he can extract from the little people, then the king can extract value from the vassal and thus indirectly the region, even without having a bureaucracy under his own control that knows every town’s Local Fruit-Gathering Rules.</p>

<p>One of the main themes of Scott’s book is that throughout history, it is infeasible for states to build the Local Fruit-Gathering Rulebook at scale if they want to increase their centralized power and do Bigger Things. So what they actually do is come through and force people to stop measuring things the ways they have and to use standard measures, to stop thinking about property rights the ways they have and to use standard property rights, to stop using names the ways they have and to use patronyms… and while everyone hitting the pointy end of it <em>hates</em> this stuff, it makes it so much easier for the top-level state to do its state business that it can expand its state aspirations and be Bigger<sup id="fnref:scott" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:scott">8</a></sup>. The capacity of the state isn’t just a function of the kind of bureaucracy you can build if you can force people to become more governable.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-stuff-doesnt-map-well-onto-the-internet">Why this stuff doesn’t map well onto the internet</h2>

<p>I would hope that everything I’m about to write is self-evident – so self-evident that you might as well skip this section. However, I would also have hoped that “people who want to sign up for an account on a new web service instead of using an old web service they don’t like as much anymore” would not consider it appropriate to term themselves “refugees”, so forgive me some obvious points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The business at scale in social media is advertising. I haven’t given up hope on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail_(book)">the long tail</a>, <a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/where-did-the-long-tail-go">Gioiaian jeremiads notwithstanding</a>, but at scale, today, direct monetization pales in comparison to advertising’s revenues. This means that the economic productivity of social media use is indirect and highly mediated. Also, the business models are often opaque. This is a lot harder to track than wheat farms in medieval France somewhere. <strong>Comparisons risk implying we understand more than we accurately do</strong> about just who’s generating value and just how. (…more on this.)</li>
  <li>In the settled medieval context, there are subsistence farmers, and there are people eating surplus that subsistence farmers were squeezed into producing. Other food sources do not exist at the scale needed for the population. Reliable sources assure me the eventual consequence of going without food is death. Social media – the whole user-content internet – is only one of a whole host of entertainments, information sources, and communication options available to the kind of person who has internet access. Breaking one’s e.g. YouTube habit may be unpleasant or difficult, but it is not inherently life-or-death. <strong>When we make comparisons between our info-luxuries and survival necessities, we ratchet up the stakes in these conversations way too high</strong>, way too fast… and we also distract from <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-health-eating-disorders-center-government-and-politics-0c8ae73f44926fa3daf66bd7caf3ad43">actual life-or-death issues at play</a>.</li>
  <li>Over my lifetime, there have been a number of attempts at manufacturing digital scarcity. They have been pretty embarrassing and not made too much of a dent. That doesn’t mean that there are <em>no</em> relevant scarcities to bear in mind – money on offer for advertising, eyeball-hours monetizable on the other end – but <strong>naive analogies between, like, namespaces and <em>arable land holdings</em> often get pretty silly</strong>.</li>
  <li>I am not in debt bondage to Instagram. You are not a LinkedIn serf. Yes, there are relevant “<a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/facebooks-war-on-switching-costs-27fa4aeb7978">switching costs</a>” to this stuff. Those are notable because they operate in contrast to the general idea of businesses offering freely substitutable goods and services, not because <em>someone will come recapture you if you try to leave</em>. When someone writes a “Why I’m Leaving Twitter” post, they do not then have to go defend their violation of an oath of homage on the battlefield! <strong>If we pretend that we’re less free to leave than we are, we distort reality in ways that only benefit the big platforms.</strong></li>
  <li>If you are a premodern small farmer, you are subject to the varying jurisdictions that cover the land you live on and farm<sup id="fnref:transhumance" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:transhumance">9</a></sup>. The social ties associated with your local community are essential to your survival. If you are an internet user today, you <a href="https://xkcd.com/1810/">have clicked through more terms of service than you can count</a>, migrated through more dead sites than you remember, and your ability to feed yourself is extraordinarily unlikely to be truly predicated on the particular group of otherwise-strangers with whom you interact on any given app<sup id="fnref:networking" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:networking">10</a></sup>. <strong>There are a lot more options to the modern internet user than acquiescence or revolt-in-place.</strong></li>
  <li>The jurisdiction associated with lords’ enfiefed land is a burden, not a perk. <strong>Having to deal with little people problems is not a longed-for opportunity to get to tell people what to do – it is part of the trade-off necessary to get to extract rents/taxes from them.</strong> Remember: these are <em>actually</em> inherited positions, not first-mover-benefits-maintained-over-time. I am sure you can find an example of some medieval baron getting petty about dumb shit (send it to me!), but for the most part, everything I’ve read suggests they are trying to further delegate this work to <em>their</em> retainers so they have more time for… you know, falconry. Fulfilling their other obligations. Flexing on other rich people. 1% problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="so-if-its-that-bad-why-do-people-keep-making-the-comparison">So if it’s that bad, why do people keep making the comparison?</h2>

<p>Reynolds’ book begins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Feudalism, to any members of the general public who ever refer to it, stands for any hierarchical and oppressive system. Bosses or landlords who bully their employees or tenants are being feudal. If they bully them fiercely they are worse: they are positively medieval.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To some extent, that’s the long and the short of it. The kind of person who imagines that the Dark Ages are called that because they weren’t yet Enlightened is not trying to make a historically-grounded point about political theory. They’re trying to say that something <em>sucks</em>. Anyone who grew up in a liberal democracy absorbed quite a lot of civic ideology about what makes governments legitimate; therefore, any authority that the speaker had no hand in appointing is a likely target of this condemnation. “Someone who isn’t me has power and control and I don’t like it”. That’s a fair thing to want to express, even if I’m salty about inaccuracy of comparison.</p>

<p>So… okay, so what? I didn’t get thousands of words into this just because <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">someone said something obviously wrong about a medieval thing on the internet</a>.</p>

<p>Can we redeem this desire to compare the two?</p>

<p>How far can we get with a comparison if we try to say <code>/u/spez</code> is right?</p>

<h2 id="steve-my-liege-a-word">Steve, my liege, a word</h2>

<p>Steve Huffman (<a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/spez"><code>/u/spez</code></a>) is the CEO of Reddit. Reddit is a social media site that is somewhat unlike its competitor social media sites in form, but which is trying to have its business become publicly traded. It therefore needs to become more like those other sites – at least in profitability narrative. Reddit makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621445/reddit-valuation-revenue-funding-round">most of its revenue from advertising</a>. It relies on a vast amount of unpaid volunteer moderation labor – <a href="https://clivethompson.medium.com/reddit-moderators-do-over-3-4-million-in-free-labor-every-year-d3571235c32c">$3.4 million’s worth a year</a>, by one estimate. Some of Huffman’s IPO-minded moves have proven <a href="https://health.wusf.usf.edu/npr-health/2023-07-01/reddit-says-new-accessibility-tools-for-moderators-are-coming-mods-are-skeptical">very hostile</a> to the moderators, who have been protesting by taking subreddits dark – restricting access or posting or otherwise <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/23/tech/reddit-john-oliver-protest/index.html">creatively disrupting their function</a>.</p>

<p>And then Steve forces my hand, <em>makes</em> me write all this, by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/reddit-protest-blackout-ceo-steve-huffman-moderators-rcna89544">saying the following</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re a politician or a business owner, you are accountable to your constituents. So a politician needs to be elected, and a business owner can be fired by its shareholders.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And I think, on Reddit, the analogy is closer to the landed gentry: The people who get there first get to stay there and pass it down to their descendants, and that is not democratic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is obviously a lot about this that immediately sounds alarms, right?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Look, I’m even less of a lawyer than I am a historian, but if “a business owner can be fired by its shareholders” then they weren’t actually the <em>owner</em> of the business, no? They were, like, a CEO or something?</li>
  <li>Conflating citizens and shareholders is a classic American thought disease. Polysyllabic cringe.</li>
  <li>It sounds like Steve thinks that “gentry” operated on <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/settlers-race-to-claim-land">Oklahoma land grab rules</a>.</li>
  <li>While <em>I</em> am willing to get hype about the general idea of property inheritance being so anti-democratic in nature that a democratic society must expropriate that property to function, I am guessing Steve Huffman, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=steve+huffman+net+worth&amp;ia=web">estimated net worth in the millions</a> Steve Huffman, is not too married to what that implies, and really intends only to speak of inherited <em>authority</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But… fine. Come at me, Huffman.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-we-get-from-comparing-moderators-to-feudal-lords">What can we get from comparing moderators to feudal lords?</h3>

<h4 id="you-need-manorialism-to-make-little-farmers-produce-surplus-and-you-need-moderation-to-make-openly-hosted-user-generated-content-ad-monetizable">You need manorialism to make little farmers produce surplus, and you need moderation to make openly hosted user-generated content ad-monetizable</h4>

<p>Our subsistence farming household does not really want to produce the kind of surplus that can then be rent-taxed away, so the feudal structure has to force that to happen to exist. There’s real production, valuable activity, going on no matter what – but to make your state a Thing you need to beat that production into a useful shape.</p>

<p>Small, closed groups of internet users often function on top of internet infrastructure without explicit internal moderation. You, the reader, are probably in a number of group texts from which you have never formally banned a member for spam.</p>

<p>The openness of a platform can create a lot <em>more</em> monetizable engagement than the group chats. There are many of you who will never get to snigger at the jokes in my group chats, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus">Homo economicus</a> might see that as lost opportunity to engage-and-advertise-and-monetize, if he squints. A missed opportunity for extractable surplus – because, like the subsistence farmers trying to maximize resilience instead of production, my friends are not sharing bad puns with an eye toward anyone’s ad revenue.</p>

<p>However, open, public internet infrastructure has its own downward tendencies. Whenever a truly unmoderated hosting service opens on the internet, there is a clock ticking down until that service is first used to host <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/11/02/hey-elon-let-me-help-you-speed-run-the-content-moderation-learning-curve/">content related to child sexual abuse.</a> The openness can create an economic opportunity, but you need moderation to make that hold together – even just on the legal front.</p>

<p>Or just imagine an ad equilibrium. You, a user, are probably willing to tolerate a certain amount of promotional stuff in a Web Thing before you go off and find another Web Thing; call it an ad-viewing threshold. Variable by individual, but probably measurable in aggregate. Promotional material that is posted by a user and shown to you counts against your threshold, and any ad space bought with the platform on your feed also counts against your threshold, but only the latter makes the platform money. If the platform has enough would-be paid-advertisers to max out whatever it estimates its users’ ad-viewing threshold to be, then it has a strong incentive to go and hunt down any user content on its platform that has even a hint of promotion and hide it from sight. Maybe it’ll get those users to give up and pay them, but even if it doesn’t, it stops them from displacing monetizable ads under your threshold<sup id="fnref:unicode" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:unicode">11</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So even if a moderator isn’t engaging with the ad infrastructure of a site, and <em>even if they’re not explicitly dealing with maintaining a high bar of “advertiser-friendliness”</em>, their role functions to make the thing stick together in the open way that produces the engagement-surplus that attracts ad money.</p>

<h4 id="local-variance-in-custom-makes-it-really-hard-to-moderate-from-outside-the-community">Local variance in custom makes it really hard to moderate from outside the community…</h4>

<p>If you ask heavy-use Redditors about their use of the site, many will, unprompted, bring up that the main big subreddits are trash and, while they might <em>also</em> subscribe to <code>/r/gifs</code> or whatever, they’re really <em>there</em> for the niche communities that are quite different – in both tone and content. Yes, it’s impressive that the recommendation algorithms on short-form video platforms can deduce my susceptibility to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nicole_coenen/">thirst-trappy woodcutter lady content</a>, but the level of specificity in which such content is arranged on Reddit is far more impressive (sometimes horrifying in its specificity, if we’re being honest). These are far more diverse in intent and effect than the “communities” of shared engagement that arise around algorithmically recommended topics.</p>

<p>Maintaining engagement on <code>/r/AskHistorians</code> requires a very different standard of post and comment moderation than e.g. <code>/r/circlejerkaustralia</code>; they are trying to be different things, people <em>go</em> to them for different things, and the rules that will best encourage posters to post and consumers to consume are different.</p>

<p>How would you do that in a scalable way from the outside? Hell, set aside trying to keep things on-topic – from the outside, how can you keep up with the ever-shifting dog whistles and coded signifiers of bigotry that accompany the first encroachments of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Nazi_bar">Nazis into your bar</a>? Maybe advertisers won’t understand either to care about the first wave, but you better believe they won’t like the media coverage of the later ones…</p>

<p>In an environment as heterogeneous and nichey as Reddit has been: you can’t. It works about as well as compiling the Local Fruit-Gathering Rules with the Firewood Addenda for every village in your nation. So if you’re going to have heterogeneous and nichey social media, you need moderation to be heterogeneous and nichey, enacted by the kind of person Scott calls a “local tracker”. <strong>Reddit as it has existed does not have the “state capacity” to do this any other way.</strong> Maybe, at least for the high-engagement subreddits that it considers most important, it can <em>replace</em> the local trackers with more compliant ones – but it can’t go without them. The king of Reddit, today, needs somebody to go be baron. If he couldn’t get them for free, he’d have to pay them.</p>

<h4 id="but-if-you-can-rent-tax-from-outside-the-community-you-can-shift-the-balance-of-power">…but if you can rent-tax from outside the community, you can shift the balance of power</h4>

<p>Reddit does not pay its moderators. It is not fully accurate to say that Reddit even confers the status and control that moderators possess, because that status and control is scoped to their moderated communities, and thus principally a function of community prominence. Anyone can be <em>a</em> mod; being a moderator of something that <em>matters</em> is something different entirely, and it’s Reddit’s userbase that makes <em>that</em> happen. On Reddit, many communities are extremely fungible; use the site long enough and you’ll observe schisms and migrations to new bits of namespace. We can argue that there is <em>some</em> extent to which community prominence is driven by the desirability of the community name, which is a bit conferred by Reddit – if I’m looking for an X subreddit, I’m going to look for <code>/r/X</code> before <code>/r/originalX</code>, <code>/r/seriousX</code>, <code>/r/XUncensored</code> etc., so there’s <em>something</em> meaningful to who gets to keep running <code>/r/X</code> – but in practice this is moderately fluid, as genres of content merge and divide even without explicit mod drama.</p>

<p>So if I were going to pin down what Reddit “gives” its mods, I would probably put it something like this: The ability to create and grow an online community with a bunch of useful (and not free-to-operate!) infrastructure and with intercommunity discovery among a large existing userbase.</p>

<p>What Reddit <em>gets</em> from its mods is – following the above – the ability to make the money that it makes from ads.</p>

<p>So how do you know whether that’s a fair trade?</p>

<p>It isn’t disqualifying to our comparison that the mods/lords don’t get paid in the same kind of thing that the company/king gets. For example, it was fairly common for the king to principally extract <em>military</em> support from the lords, rather than the same kind of rent-taxes the lords extracted from the commoners. However, this dynamic was always a bit in flux; making your vassals mad by giving them a shitty trade-off posed risks the king had to deal with in much the same way that the lords had to contend with the risk of overtaxing the populace. No one involved was <em>stupid</em>, and all the weird ideological language about divine right of kings shouldn’t make you think that people weren’t looking out for their own interests.</p>

<p>But crucially – the lords knew what kind of revenues they were getting from their lands, and they knew what the king was getting from them in turn. Maybe they’d lie to the king about the exact surpluses they’d extracted, just like the farmers would lie as much as possible about how much surplus there <em>was</em> – but their local control meant they had the local knowledge necessary to piece together the situation themselves.</p>

<p>So you can <em>imagine</em> that maybe the status quo <em>is</em> a fair trade – maybe the costs of running Reddit (data centers, engineers, lawyers), minus the ad revenue pretty much balance what Reddit gets from the mods in return for the chance to run their little communities. But how do you <em>know</em>?</p>

<p>A mod might be able to estimate how replaceable the job they do is, how replaceable their <em>community</em> is, and start trying to figure out what their leverage is…</p>

<p>But how do they estimate Reddit’s end of the deal?</p>

<p>Let’s talk about online advertising platforms for a second. (Sorry.)</p>

<p>YouTube does some revenue-sharing with video creators, so the amount of information exposed illustrates some interesting dynamics. First, remember: <em>many videos lose YouTube money, possibly even most.</em> They don’t ever get enough monetizable engagement to pay for their own (secret) marginal contributions to operating costs. Video hosting is expensive! But where there <em>is</em> monetizable engagement, the fact that we have <em>some</em> numbers doesn’t clear as much up as you might think.</p>

<p>Let’s say there’s some genre of enterprise software that’s hugely profitable to sell, but niche in potential customers; to advertise products of this kind, you need to reach people who work at companies who have jobs where they can influence buying decisions. Let’s say you are trying to sell one of these products. You know that the kind of person with the kind of job that makes them useful to influence likely uses some <em>other</em> kind of software – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableau_Software">Tableau</a>, maybe. Now let’s say that <em>I</em> run a YouTube channel with Tableau tutorials. You and your competitors want to advertise on my channel <em>so bad</em>. Maybe you don’t specifically know about my channel, and you’re letting YouTube figure out the eligibility of where to put your ads – but that’s the advertising opportunity that might <em>work</em> for your business, so if YouTube is willing to offer you that specificity, it’s gonna be valuable to you, and that means it’s gonna be <em>pricey</em>. If YouTube is revenue-sharing <em>honestly</em>, then <em>that</em> means that <em>I</em> am gonna get a way bigger cut per video than the creator of a <em>equally watched</em> channel that doesn’t imply some super-valuable advertising opportunity. And indeed, we see some amount of that: “best short term insurance plans” as keywords gets a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_impression">CPM</a> about <a href="https://vloggerpro.com/youtube-niches-with-high-cpm/">50 times higher than “best USB mic”</a>, and some of that trickles down to the actual video creators.</p>

<p>But this can be alienated in ways that give the advertising platform a leg up. Let’s say that there’s a Norwegian law news channel that, like, <em>every</em> Norwegian lawyer watches religiously. It doesn’t post much, maybe, so it doesn’t get a ton of traffic, but the correlation is flawless. Norway has a high CPM, law has a high CPM, so let’s just say that intersection is a super valuable advertising target. Furthermore, though, this channel is so <em>boring</em> and <em>specific</em> that probably anyone who watches it much <em>is</em> a Norwegian lawyer. YouTube keeps track of those accounts. Let’s say there’s a <em>second</em> channel that’s all about… I dunno, drama commentary about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_National_Opera_and_Ballet">Norwegian National Opera and Ballet</a>, and it just so happens that – unbeknownst to either the law news channel or the opera drama channel – Norwegian lawyers eat this opera drama shit up. This second channel might not have any high-CPM topics associated with it – but <em>if</em> YouTube lets advertisers target by “likely to be a Norwegian lawyer” rather than keywords associated with the actual opera video, then the <em>signal</em> about target demographics gathered from the law news channel combined with the <em>engagement</em> generated by the opera drama channel creates very profitable advertising opportunities for YouTube. Should the law news channel get a cut of the law-targeted ads on the opera drama channel because its content provided the signal that let that targeting happen<sup id="fnref:targeting" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:targeting">12</a></sup>? Should the opera drama channel be paid better for desirability of the eyeball-hours it attracts, independently of opera drama keyword CPM? Does either channel have accurate information on how competitive its market is? If neither channel knows about the correlation, how incentivized is YouTube to remunerate them for the profitability of the intersection?</p>

<p>Maybe YouTube has the data it could crunch to figure out the marginal contributions there, but this begins to <em>sound</em> a bit like… parcels of land that maybe you can farm on <em>some</em> of the year, but during the <em>dry</em> season your <em>neighbors</em> can graze their <em>animals</em> on, but then with <em>trees</em> that the <em>old</em> tenants get to harvest… Right?</p>

<p>Substitute “subreddit” for “YouTube channel” and mix in that Reddit doesn’t have to share its detailed ad numbers, and you start to see how <strong>any given moderator of any given community can’t know whether they’re being exploited or how badly</strong>, even if as a whole it seems like mods produce way more value for Reddit than they benefit from. <em>Your</em> subreddit might marginally make Reddit a ton of money or might <em>lose</em> Reddit money, and you have no visibility into which.</p>

<p>The real dynamics of online advertising are fundamentally hidden from the creators of content and from volunteer moderators, and this means that no one can negotiate from their own actual value in the market. The illegibility of local variation may have meant that feudal lords were necessary to the feudal state, and the illegibility of local custom may similarly have meant that community-embedded moderators are necessary to Reddit as it exists today, but <strong>these platforms have information asymmetry</strong> that weights the balance of power heavily toward them. That’s kinda wild, and I can’t think of a parallel that real landed gentry had to put up with.</p>

<h4 id="the-tension-between-custom-and-putative-authority-seems-important-for-understanding-feudalism-and-moderator-revolt">The tension between custom and putative authority seems important for understanding feudalism and moderator revolt</h4>

<p>Let’s say the king comes to you, a feudal lord, and tells you that <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/peter-the-greats-beard-tax/">you’ve got to shave your beard</a>. Maybe he bothers justifying it, whatever. You don’t <em>want</em> to shave your beard. “You know, your Majesty,” you say, “this new law seems pretty risky. Obviously <em>I</em> would never, but, uh, what if the rest of the lords tell you to, you know. Fuck off?”</p>

<p>One thing the king <em>might</em> say is “Well, my good man, who would <em>definitely</em> never say such a thing himself, they only matter because <em>I</em> say they do. Because God says <em>I</em> matter, and <em>I</em> delegated authority <em>to</em> them. And they know that, so they know that it would be both inherently ridiculous and self-defeating to go against me. Like, what would they be without me? Nothing. Peasants in violation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_law#Scotland">sumptuary law</a>.”</p>

<p>You are not totally confident in this description of affairs. It sort of seems to you that the tenant farmers under you are mostly under your control because everyone’s used to it and because you pay men with pointy metal things to tidy up the exceptions, not because you have a royal stamp of officialdom. Sure, <em>technically</em> you are <em>under</em> this king, but is that really relevant to how the yearly harvest gets brought in and taxed? If that royal stamp were revoked, wouldn’t you still be able to exploit the local farmers all the same?</p>

<p>But it’s a little ambiguous. Even if the king’s authority seems like a fiction, if he has the military power to come in, squash you, and give your fief to the neighboring Baron Dogface, then… well, the little people would probably shrug and pay rent-tax to Dogface and try to get on with their own lives.</p>

<p>So who does a subreddit belong to?</p>

<p>Imagine starting one, hyping it up, patiently providing four-fifths of the content until people show up, moderating spam, moderating jerks, growing it gradually over time. Setting rules, establishing tone, running the weekly topical threads. Would you feel like that <code>/r/whateverItWas</code> existed because of <em>Reddit the company</em>? Would you feel like it fundamentally belonged to his Royal Highness Steve, and Steve was just delegating it to you to run? No! You started it! You shaped it! You collaborated with the people it attracted to make it what it is! Even those users – they could switch <em>tomorrow</em> to <code>/r/whateverItWasTwo</code> and you couldn’t do a thing about it – if they decided they didn’t like your vision for <code>/r/whateverItWas</code>, they <em>would</em>, so the fact that they’re still here is a kind of voting with your feet, it <em>validates</em> what you’re doing… To the extent that <code>/r/whateverItWas</code> exists as a <em>thing</em> within Reddit as a whole, to be run or misrun, managed or mismanaged? It feels like <em>yours</em>.</p>

<p>But at the same time, to an external observer – you can see how they would feel that this is pretty silly, right? The thing that’s “yours” is nothing but rows and columns in Reddit’s databases<sup id="fnref:rdbms" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rdbms">13</a></sup>, a series of flags giving you the power to moderate. The only thing you have is set in Reddit’s systems, a permission to edit stuff under a certain scope a bit differently than other users, wo<em>wee</em> aren’t you important. It’s not you who has a license to the user posts, it’s not you who controls anything but a tiny little square of grass Reddit let you mow. You’re gonna <em>protest</em> over that? The world at large already doesn’t understand why you might volunteer for this work, why you might care enough to do it unpaid – you seem like a schmuck to them, a victim.</p>

<p><strong>But not to Steve.</strong></p>

<p>Steve is calling you landed gentry not because he’s <em>really</em> proposing to make things more <em>democratic.</em> Plenty of the protesting subreddits <em>voted</em> to protest – and even if Reddit vomits some PR about how that only reflects, like, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule">the 9% rather than the 90%</a> that never vote, it’s not really a convincing argument, is it? Steve is calling you landed gentry because <strong>he knows you work for him, making him money, and he wishes that you understood your authority to be delegated from him as your liege lord</strong>. Steve is annoyed that you feel like you have your own thing by local custom when what he sees is a bunch of flags in tables that are getting in the way of his business decisions<sup id="fnref:annoyed" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:annoyed">14</a></sup>.</p>

<p>And I’m pretty sure Steve would like to modernize this whole feudal mess and remove the locality of your control.</p>

<h3 id="the-early-modern-state-comes-to-reddit">The early modern state comes to Reddit</h3>

<p>If we go back to Seeing Like A State for a minute… Technologies and practices that enabled central control were critical in the progression of the early modern state. Get rid of all that local variation in law and standardize it. Get rid of all those confusing local measurements. Bulldoze weird little windy streets and create boulevards that will make it easier to subdue local resistance. Propagandize to center your own importance. Use new media to extend your influence and control. Now you don’t need those local trackers like you once did, now you can administer your state more effectively centrally.</p>

<p>You know who’s managed this beautifully?</p>

<p>TikTok.</p>

<p>TikTok is really good at making people <em>feel</em> like they are seeing hyper-individualized content, but never allowing any explicit division of spaces within it. Without that division, no local norms can be established, no real preference expressed, and thus the tone of content is often uncannily homogeneous across wildly variant topics. This is what you’d expect: the unsteerable algorithmic recommendation feed feels like the final form of <a href="https://www.roughtype.com/?p=8724">content collapse</a>.</p>

<p>If I were a profit-maximizing social media company trying to expand my “state capacity”, I would be throwing money at every feature I could that took explicit navigation away from users, instead offering them frictionless spoon-feeding. Why? Social media that is homogenized (standard language!) is easier to moderate at scale. Moderation that is opaque (downweighting within hidden rankings) is easier to enact without objection, and tunably toward my engagement goals. Without even a sense of search keywords, I would increase the opacity of my advertising even further, obscuring from content creators the value I extract from them. These moves parallel the ones that Scott outlines early modern states taking to pull themselves out of dependency on local trackers. Remember: you don’t have to come up with a bureaucracy that can better handle the nation you have <em>if you can change the nation itself</em> to make it more governable.</p>

<p>And don’t you see those moves coming to Reddit?</p>

<p>I mean, maybe you <em>don’t</em> – Reddit has been pretty clever in allowing power users to maintain the old view characterized by explicit control even while it funnels new eyeballs toward recsys pablum. Part of Reddit’s whole IPO story <em>has</em> to be proving that it can provide a beautifully monetizable spoon-fed Infinite Recommended Content Feed just like Instagram or TikTok or Twitter or whatever – that’s just how social media companies are structured now. But especially if you’re used to using <code>https://old.reddit.com/</code> or one of the very good third party apps that has existed – pop open a private window and navigate to the normal home page. Doesn’t that look a <em>bit</em> like they’re trying to navigate away from how Reddit has always been and towards e.g. Twitter?</p>

<p>So maybe Reddit moderators <em>are</em> like feudal lords in that they have been the necessary structure that allowed Reddit communities to be so <em>wildly</em> different all this time.</p>

<p>And maybe we need to lean into those metaphorical comparisons to imagine what’s coming next. Bloggers invoking the high-level “enclosure of the commons” are phoning it in. Let’s talk <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure#The_end_of_the_Open_Field_system">conversion of copyholders into leaseholders to remove customary rights</a>.</p>

<p>And maybe we need to look at the ways those metaphorical comparisons <em>don’t</em> hold to imagine our ways <em>out</em>. Premodern subsistence farmers and early modern state subjects didn’t have all the options we do. You can’t bootstrap an alternate state by, like, automating crossposting, but on the internet all <em>kinds</em> of things are possible. (Hell, reminds one a bit of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z4444w/how-reddit-got-huge-tons-of-fake-accounts--2">Reddit’s own fakery</a>, dunnit?)</p>

<p>So as a non-moderator, as a <em>peasant</em>, as an <em>un-titled pleb</em>, I’d like to thank Steve for issuing the most CEO-flavored version of the age-old phpBB “the mods are mad with power!” complaint I’ve ever heard in my goddamn life.</p>

<p>Long live the King.</p>
