<p>Beginnings are messy. Always. And that’s how they should be.</p>
<p>If we waited for perfect, we’d never start anything. Ideas don’t arrive fully formed; they evolve through iterations and stumbles. Like a sculpture, they take time to shape and refine.</p>
<p>Action takes courage? Not necessarily. Inaction occurs when expectaions are too high.</p>
<p>Action requires lowering the stakes. Shoot for the first sentence of the first draft of the first version. Treat the project as a work in progress rather than a defining moment. Start so small that it feels laughable and take actions that are so tiny they hardly register as progress.</p>
<p>Perfect isn’t the goal — progress is. And progress only happens when we accept the mess and take the first step.</p>
