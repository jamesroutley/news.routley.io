    <h1>The most cited authors in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</h1>

<p>Time for my five-year update of the most-cited authors in the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/contents.html">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>!  (Past analyses: <a href="http://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/200-most-cited-contemporary-authors-in.html">2010</a>, <a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-266-most-cited-contemporary-authors.html">2014</a>, <a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-295-most-cited-contemporary-authors.html">2019</a>.)</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSWwUsuTXVcc4MxQXZkvma1Iyncg_Ps2axqnaQkJs7rREJjmJuD5CBCxRoxpoPWxU2I7hMJJBux7hbYwfycEc8K43JySsep_SOB3iXaM8eeaCCArwt0dSH4kM0qf9lnny7N6d_kDe3kvjUL9i6zeTsD5GtHEil5RiNA3rrEYrndkDlw3Z_FtrvMQ/s784/David_Lewis_%281962%29_%28cropped%29.webp.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="784" data-original-width="563" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSWwUsuTXVcc4MxQXZkvma1Iyncg_Ps2axqnaQkJs7rREJjmJuD5CBCxRoxpoPWxU2I7hMJJBux7hbYwfycEc8K43JySsep_SOB3iXaM8eeaCCArwt0dSH4kM0qf9lnny7N6d_kDe3kvjUL9i6zeTsD5GtHEil5RiNA3rrEYrndkDlw3Z_FtrvMQ/s320/David_Lewis_%281962%29_%28cropped%29.webp.png"/></a></p><p>

Method</p><p>
  
* Only authors born 1900 or later are included.</p><p>

* Each author is only counted once per headline entry (subentries are excluded). In 2010, I found that this generated more plausible results than counting authors multiple times per entry.</p><p>

* As in 2019, but unlike 2014 and 2010, I include co-authors.  Due to the unsystematic formatting of SEP references, this was a somewhat noisy process.  To capture last authors, I searched for &#34;and&#34; or &#34;&amp;&#34; in each bibliographic line, if appearing before a &#34;19&#34;, &#34;20&#34;, &#34;forthcoming&#34;, or &#34;in press&#34;, then pulled the text immediately after.  To capture second authors that were not last authors, I searched for a second comma before such a date-preceding &#34;and&#34; or &#34;&amp;&#34;, then pulled the text after that.  I omitted co-authors in position three or higher unless they were last author.  Fortunately for the analysis, co-authorship is relatively uncommon in philosophy compared to the sciences, constituting by my estimate less than 10% of the bibliographic lines.</p><p>

* Also as in 2019 but unlike 2014, I included editors, but only if their name appears before the date in the bibliographical line. Putting the editor at the front of the bibliographical line highlights the editor&#39;s role or the edited collection as a whole.</p><p>

* After computerized search and sort, I hand-coded the data, in some cases correcting misspellings and merging authors (e.g., Ruth Barcan = Ruth Marcus), more often separating authors with similar names (e.g., various A. Goldmans and J. Cohens), in a process that involved some guesswork and pattern recognition. Inconsistent syntax and imperfect redundancy removal procedures also created some error, though nothing large or systematic that I noticed. Bear in mind that with about 208,000 bibliographic entries, perfection is not possible! I estimate coding error of up to about +/- 2 entries.</p><p>

* To find the equivalent score of an author not included on this list, you can search the SEP site and count the number of hits, subtracting appearances in subentries and appearances other than first, second, or last headline editor or author in a bibliographic line (near the beginning of the entry, before the date).  I also welcome thoughtful corrections that apply this method.</p><p>

This list generates a rough measure of <b>current influence in what I call &#34;mainstream Anglophone philosophy&#34;</b> (a sociological category I have defined and discussed, e.g., <a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Anglophone.htm">here</a> and <a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/10/why-i-will-be-contributing-rankings-to.html">here</a>). For example, the top five -- Lewis, Quine, Putnam, Rawls, and Kripke -- are the same (in a different order) as the top five in <a href="https://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/03/best-anglophone-philosophers-since-1957.html">Brian Leiter&#39;s poll results concerning the best Anglophone philosophers since 1957</a>. Better-known bibliographic metrics, like Google Scholar and Web of Science do not as accurately measure this particular sociological phenomenon.  See my <a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2021/12/comparing-three-no-four-top-20-lists-in.html">2021 discussion of ranking philosophy rankings</a>.</p><p>

The list captures, if anything, a moment in one particular academic philosophical culture. For example, despite Michel Foucault&#39;s huge global academic influence, <a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2022/06/the-continentalanalytic-divide-is-alive.html">mainstream Anglophone philosophers rarely cite him</a>, and on this list he ranks #187.</p><p>

Further caveats:</p><p>

* Philosophers who work on topics that are underrepresented in the Stanford Encyclopedia relative to their visibility in mainstream Anglophone philosophy will appear lower on the list than their eminence would suggest.</p><p>

* Authors who have a transformative impact in one area will probably be underrepresented or underranked relative to authors who make significant but less transformative contributions to several topics.</p><p>

* Editors of the Stanford Encyclopedia might be somewhat overrepresented, since they might tend to disproportionately solicit entries on topics to which they have contributed and authors might feel some pressure to cite them in their entries.</p><p>

* Given a large bias toward citing recent work, philosophers whose main contributions were before 1960 are probably substantially underrated on this list relative to their influence in mainstream Anglophone philosophy.</p><p>

* Yes, I&#39;m on this list (in a tie for #232). I find this somewhat embarrassing, since I think this method substantially overrates me (see the 2nd and 4th caveats). If you could withhold congratulations and comparisons, I&#39;d appreciate it!</p><p>

As I did in 2019, I will follow up later with some demographic analyses.  Thanks to UCR comp lit and philosophy student Jordan Jackson for his help with the computer code.</p><p>
