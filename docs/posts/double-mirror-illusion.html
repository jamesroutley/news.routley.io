		<p><span>About the journal</span></p>
<p>Journal of Illusion (ISSN: 2436-4045) is an open-access journal that aims at gathering resources to promote the study of illusion. JOI defines an illusion as the perception of an object or phenomenon that is considered to be inconsistent with individual’s or group’s prior knowledge, recognition, or belief as to what the object or phenomenon should be in perception, cognition, and/or physics.  Therefore, JOI focuses on perceptual illusions, cognitive illusions (e.g. magic or misunderstanding) or physical illusions (e.g. mirage or the Doppler effect). For perceptual illusions, not only visual illusions but also illusions at various sensory modalities are welcome. Trompe l’oeil as well as illusion artworks are also welcome. <strong><a href="https://journals.openacademia.net/index.php/joi/about">Learn more &gt;&gt;</a></strong></p>
