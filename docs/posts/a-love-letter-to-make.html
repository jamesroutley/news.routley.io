     Dear make,
    </p>
    <p>
     As I sit here thinking about you, I can’t help but feel a rush of excitement in
my heart. I know that to some, you may seem like a dry and unromantic tool, but
to me, you are the epitome of true love. Your simple syntax and powerful
capabilities have stolen my heart and made my programming process so much
smoother. Who knows how many keystrokes you have saved me since we first met? I
used to spend hours typing out long and complex build commands, but now, with
you by my side, those days are long gone. I shudder to think about how much time
and energy I would have wasted without you.
    </p>
    <p>
     Your knack for automating commands and streamlining my build, is like a loving
partner who knows exactly what I need before I even ask. It’s as if you have a
sixth sense for my needs and desires. You’re like a chameleon that can adapt to
any language or environment. That kind of versatility is seriously impressive,
and it makes me feel like you’re always up for a new adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what really sets you apart, is your reliability. You never let me down or
give me any trouble. You always do exactly what I tell you to do, without any
fuss or drama, and you’re always there wherever I go. That kind of dependability
is what every programmer dreams of in a partner.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, let’s be real here, make, you’re not perfect. I have to admit that
sometimes you can be a little old-fashioned and quirky, with your insistence on
using tabs instead of spaces, and your archaic syntax that can take some getting
used to. And don’t even get me started on those <code>.PHONY</code> targets. Despite your
quirks and flaws though, I still love you. Because when it comes down to it,
your benefits far outweigh your drawbacks. You make my programming process so
much more efficient and streamlined, and you save me countless hours of tedious
work. Plus, you’re always there for me when I need you, and you never let me
down.
    </p>
    <p>
     So here’s to you, make - quirks and all. You may not be perfect, but you’re
pretty darn close. Thank you for being the tool that I never knew I needed, and
for making my life as a programmer so much easier and more enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
     With love and a pinch of frustration,
    </p>
    <p>
