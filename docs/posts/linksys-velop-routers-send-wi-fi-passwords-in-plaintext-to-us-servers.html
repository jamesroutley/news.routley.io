    <h1>Linksys Velop routers send Wi-Fi passwords in plaintext to US servers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to Testaankoop, the Belgian equivalent of the Consumers’ Association, two types of Linksys routers are <a href="https://www.test-aankoop.be/hightech/wifi-versterkers/nieuws/router-linksys-onveilig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sending Wi-Fi login details in plaintext</a> to American Amazon servers. This discovery involves the Linksys Velop Pro 6E and Velop Pro 7 mesh routers.</p><p>During routine installation checks, Testaankoop detected several data packets being transmitted to an Amazon server in the US. These packets included the configured SSID name and password in clear text, identification tokens for the network within a broader database, and an access token for a user session, potentially paving the way for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.</p><blockquote><p>During installation, the router sent several data packets to an Amazon server in the US. These packets contained the configured SSID name and password in clear text, as well as some identification tokens for this network within a broader database and an access token for a user session that could potentially enable a MITM attack.</p>
<cite>Testaankoop</cite></blockquote><p>A MITM attack is a security breach in which an attacker intercepts communication between two parties without either party’s knowledge, allowing the attacker to read or alter the exchanged messages.</p><p>The consumer organization conducted these tests using the latest firmware available at the time. Despite warning Linksys in November, no effective measures have been taken.</p><blockquote><p>The Velop 6E and 7 we tested had the most recent firmware. The Velop 6E was tested several times, the last time with firmware V 1.0.8 MX6200_1.0.8.215731 and the new Velop Pro 7 was tested with firmware 1.0.10.215314.</p>
<cite>Testaankoop</cite></blockquote><p>Linksys released a firmware update after the initial warning, but it did not address the concerns raised. “We regret the lack of response from Linksys and expected more from such a renowned brand,” Testaankoop expressed.</p><p>Testaankoop suspects the security issue might stem from third-party software used in the Linksys firmware. However, they emphasize that this does not excuse the vulnerability. For those who already own the affected routers, they have recommended changing the Wi-Fi network name and password via the web interface instead of the app. This precaution prevents the SSID name and password from being transmitted in readable text.</p><p>Mesh routers like <a href="https://store.linksys.com/shop/shop-home/whole-home-mesh-wifi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Velop series</a> are designed to improve Wi-Fi distribution in large or multi-story homes by creating a wireless network through multiple connected nodes. These nodes communicate either wirelessly or through cables to ensure better Wi-Fi coverage. However, the Velop Pro WiFi 6E and Pro 7’s data transmission practices undermine the security benefits they should provide.</p><p>Testaankoop contacted Linksys again just days before today’s publication in response to the ongoing issue, giving them a brief window to respond. However, they have not received any acknowledgment or solution from the manufacturer.</p><p>The vulnerability persists even in the latest Linksys 7 Pro, highlighting a critical security lapse. “After our long and intensive tests, we strongly advise against buying the Linksys Velop Pro WiFi 6E and Pro 7 because there is a serious risk of network intrusion and data loss,” the researchers concluded.</p><p><em>Stack Diary has also contacted Linksys to see if they plan on responding.</em></p></div></div>
