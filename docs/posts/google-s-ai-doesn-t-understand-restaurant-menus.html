    <h1>Google&#39;s AI Doesn&#39;t Understand Restaurant Menus</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
<p>In the glorious future, every website will be chock-full of semantic metadata. Restaurants won&#39;t have a 50MB PDF explaining the chef&#39;s vision for organic cuisine - instead, they&#39;ll have <a href="https://schema.org/Menu">little scraps of data on the HTML page</a> like:</p><pre><code>&#34;hasMenuItem&#34;:{
  &#34;@type&#34;:&#34;MenuItem&#34;,
   &#34;name&#34;:&#34;Dodo In A Bun&#34;,
   &#34;description&#34;:&#34;The legendary extinct bird cooked in tomato sauce, served in a gluten-free bun.&#34;,
     &#34;offers&#34;:{
       &#34;@type&#34;:&#34;Offer&#34;,
       &#34;price&#34;:&#34;7.99&#34;,
       &#34;priceCurrency&#34;:&#34;GBP&#34;
     },
</code></pre><p>But, for now, they don&#39;t.  So Google uses MACHINE LEARNING and DEEP AI to scrape the menus out of PDFs and photos submitted by patrons.  It works about as well as you&#39;d expect.</p><h2 id="examples"><a href="#examples">Examples</a></h2><p>Here&#39;s a bunch of screenshots from Google Maps. Would a human have made these mistakes? (No they&#39;d make much more interesting mistakes!)</p><p><img src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Burger.jpeg" alt="Chicken £0.86. Gourmet Burger £810.76. Veggie US$10.76." width="540" height="540"/></p><p>Are those realistic prices for burgers? Would a place that sells a gold-covered burger also sell second-hand chicken? Is it usual that UK menus offer items in different currencies? What about this:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/paper.jpeg" alt="A side dish called &#34;plain paper&#34; for £45" width="540" height="540"/></p><p>Is that a likely name for a side dish? You wouldn&#39;t find that even in trendy Shoreditch. And, again with the weird pricing. Side dishes rarely cost that much. Still, it could be worse…</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/tikka.jpeg" alt="Chicken Tika Massala listed for £1,990." width="540" height="304"/></p><p>I <em>guarantee</em> you the little curry shop I was looking at didn&#39;t have anything on the menu that pricey!</p><p>Other times, it seems to just pick random words in a vague attempt to be &#34;useful&#34;.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Salad.jpg" alt="List of salads including one called &#34;the&#34;. And another called &#34;middle&#34;." width="540" height="540"/></p><p>Perhaps my favourite is this British restaurant which offers <del>spam, spam, and more spam</del>:</p><p>There were dozens (dozens!) of examples I found within a few minutes of looking for somewhere nearby to grab a cheap lunch. To be fair, when the website has supplied data in an appropriate format, Google is good at displaying it. But when Google tries to be clever... ah.</p><p>There is, of course, no way for a user to contact Google and say &#34;I dunno, man. This looks kinda off.&#34;</p><h2 id="whose-fault-is-it-anyway"><a href="#whose-fault-is-it-anyway">Whose Fault Is It Anyway?</a></h2><p>Obviously, restaurateurs should provide machine-readable descriptions of their menus. That way search engines, smart speakers, and all sorts of funky computers will be able to parse the food available.</p><p>But they don&#39;t. Because they&#39;re busy cooking.</p><p>Google has discovered that it takes 90% of the effort to get 90% of the way there - but the last 10% takes the next 90% of the effort.</p><p>As ever, a feature has launched and it is of dubious value to business owners and customers - but I&#39;m sure a product manager at Google got their wings.</p></div></div>
