<p>Helix is a modal text editor with built-in support for multiple selections,
Language Server Protocol (LSP), tree-sitter, and experimental support for Debug
Adapter Protocol (DAP).</p>
<p>Today we cut the 22.12 release. This release is big and featureful and saw
contributions from 99 contributors. Thank you all! ðŸŽŠ</p>
<p>Helix now has a logo! Thank you <a href="https://github.com/jakehl"><code>@jakehl</code></a> for your
contribution!</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s jump into the highlights.</p>
<h2 id="git-diff-gutter">Git diff gutter</h2>
<asciinema-player src="/git-diff-gutter.cast" cols="94" rows="25"></asciinema-player>
<p>The new git diff gutter tracks the changes in the current buffer compared to
the the git index. The markers in the gutter indicate additions, modifications,
and removals compared to the file checked in to git. The git diff gutter is
enabled by default.</p>
<p>Also be sure to try out the new hunk textobject: <code>]g</code> jumps to the next changed
hunk and <code>[g</code> jumps to the previous.</p>
<h2 id="underline-styles-and-colors">Underline styles and colors</h2>
<img src="https://helix-editor.com/undercurl.png"/>
<p>Terminals with support for extended underlines can render underlines with
styles like curls or dots as well as colors. Extended underlines can be used to
improve the display of LSP diagnostics. These can be configured in themes with
the new <code>underline</code> key:</p>
<pre data-lang="toml"><code data-lang="toml"><span>&#34;</span><span>diagnostic.error</span><span>&#34; = { </span><span>underline </span><span>= { </span><span>style </span><span>= &#34;</span><span>curl</span><span>&#34;, </span><span>color </span><span>= &#34;</span><span>red</span><span>&#34; } }
</span></code></pre>
<p>The existing <code>underline</code> modifier is now an alias for the <code>&#34;line&#34;</code> style.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re looking to use this in a theme that hasn&#39;t configured it yet, you
can use the new <a href="https://docs.helix-editor.com/master/themes.html#inheritance">theme inheritance</a> feature to modify just the scopes you would
like to change:</p>
<pre data-lang="toml"><code data-lang="toml"><span># ~/.config/helix/themes/my-onedark.toml
</span><span>inherits </span><span>= &#34;</span><span>onedark</span><span>&#34;
</span><span>
</span><span>&#34;</span><span>diagnostic.error</span><span>&#34; = { </span><span>fg </span><span>= &#34;</span><span>errorfg</span><span>&#34;, </span><span>bg </span><span>= &#34;</span><span>errorbg</span><span>&#34;, </span><span>underline </span><span>= { </span><span>color </span><span>= &#34;</span><span>red</span><span>&#34; } }
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="autosave-when-the-terminal-loses-focus">Autosave when the terminal loses focus</h2>
<img src="https://helix-editor.com/auto-save.gif"/>
<p>Terminals with support for focus events can now automatically save the current
file when you focus on a new window. Enable this behavior by setting the
<code>editor.auto-save</code> configuration key to <code>true</code>.</p>
<h2 id="multi-cursor-completion">Multi-cursor completion</h2>
<asciinema-player src="/multi-cursor-completion.cast" cols="94" rows="25"></asciinema-player>
<p>Editing with multiple selections is a central feature within helix. LSP
auto-completion now applies to all cursors when editing with multiple
selections, making it easy to replace multiple instances of a symbol with
auto-complete&#39;s help.</p>
<h2 id="bufferline">Bufferline</h2>
<asciinema-player src="/bufferline.cast" cols="94" rows="25"></asciinema-player>
<p>The bufferline is a listing of buffers displayed at the top of a window. It
provides an at-a-glance view of the buffers you&#39;re working with. Set
the <code>editor.bufferline</code> configuration key to <code>&#34;always&#34;</code> to always show the
bufferline, <code>&#34;multiple&#34;</code> to show the bufferline only when there are multiple
buffers open, and <code>&#34;never&#34;</code> to disable it.</p>
<h2 id="behind-the-scenes-improvements">Behind-the-scenes improvements</h2>
<p>22.12 brings also brings important changes to Helix&#39;s plumbing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code-path for writing files has been overhauled. This fixes a number of
edge cases around writing large files and failures to write.</li>
<li>Performance has been improved for tree-sitter parsing, querying and the
handling of injections. This is a noticeable speed boost for large markdown
files in particular since markdown uses injections extensively.</li>
<li>Failure handling in the LSP code-paths has been improved. Helix now
gracefully handles cases like language servers not supporting capabilities
and unexpected language server crashes.</li>
<li>The speed and memory usage of the <code>:reload</code> command has been vastly improved.
This comes from the creation of <a href="https://github.com/pascalkuthe/imara-diff"><code>imara-diff</code></a>, a new diffing
implementation which is faster than the one used internally by <code>git</code>!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>There are many more changes arriving now in 22.12 than we can fit in this post.
Check out the 22.12 <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2212-2022-12-06">changelog</a> for the full details on all of the performance
boosts, usability improvements and fixes in 22.12.</p>
