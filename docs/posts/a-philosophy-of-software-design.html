    <h1>A Philosophy of Software Design</h1>

<p>
  In July of 2021 I released the Second Edition of
  <i>A Philosophy of Software Design</i>. This edition is available
  on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/173210221X">Amazon</a>
  in both paperback and electronic form. There are only a
  few significant changes from the First Edition:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    There is a new chapter &#34;Decide What Matters&#34; that talks about
    how good software design is about separating what&#39;s important from
    what&#39;s not important and focusing on what&#39;s important.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since the First Edition was published, the importance of
    choosing general-purpose approaches has become even more clear
    to me. I have reworked and expanded Chapter 6 (&#34;General-Purpose
    Modules are Deeper&#34;) to reflect this, and I&#39;ve moved some material
    from other chapters to Chapter 6.
  </li>
  <li>
    I have added subsections in two chapters to compare the book&#39;s
    design philosophy with that of Robert Martin&#39;s <i>Clean Code</i>
    (we have significant differences of opinion on topics such as
    the length of methods and the role of comments).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For the benefit of people who already purchased the First Edition,
  I have made the two new chapters and the comparisons
  with <i>Clean Code</i> available in a
  <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/aposd2ndEdExtract.pdf">book extract</a>.
  It may not be worth buying the Second Edition if you already own
  the First Edition.
