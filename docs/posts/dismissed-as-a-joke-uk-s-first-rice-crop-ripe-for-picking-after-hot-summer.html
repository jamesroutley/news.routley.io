It could also help the UK tackle climate change.</p><p>The land in the Fens is some of the most productive in the UK. A third of the vegetables grown in Britain come from here, with a value of around £1.2bn per year. But this has a significant cost for the environment and climate.</p><p>The farms are on rich peat soil that used to be underwater but is now slowly drying out. That is releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Nationally, peat soils account for 3% of our greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>That is also degrading the quality of the soil, a change seen in real time by farmers like Craig and Sarah.
