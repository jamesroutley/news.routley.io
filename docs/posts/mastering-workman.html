          <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/article/living-world/jumping-in-the-deep-end-with-workman">&#34;Jumping in the deep end with Workman&#34;</a>, I concluded:

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I intended to title this post &#34;Mastering Workman&#34;, but I don&#39;t think
            I&#39;ve reached mastery yet. Hopefully next time I report back I&#39;ll
            feel that way!
          </p>

        <p>
          I&#39;m happy to say that I feel that way now! I just typed at 90 wpm in a
          typing test. Based on the previous post, that&#39;s just below or the same
          as my QWERTY typing speed in 2020. I&#39;m close to typing at the speed of
          thought. Plus, my Vim skills are back to the same level.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don&#39;t remember when my typing speed improved. Based on my
          progression when I started using Workman, it probably took a month or
          more to go from 70 wpm to 90.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using Workman hasn&#39;t changed my life. My hands feel slightly less
          strained compared to using QWERTY, but that might be in my head. And
          my typing speed hasn&#39;t changed much.
        </p>
        <p>
          While learning Workman, I successfully built a habit of capitalizing
          letters using the hand not typing the letter. For example, when typing
          a capital L, I use the left Shift key. For Q, I use right Shift. I
          also tried and failed to switch fingers for a few letters. For
          example, I started using my left pinky for Q, but reverted to my left
          ring finger.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can no longer touch type using QWERTY. If I look at the keyboard
          while typing, I reach 60 wpm in a typing test. I might type faster in
          a real situation, though. In a typing test, it&#39;s more important to
          look at the screen, to see what to type next. In real life, I usually
          type my own ideas, not a set text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning Workman wasn&#39;t worth the investment. I spent 15 minutes a day
          for 15 days practicing Workman using
          <a href="https://www.keybr.com">Keybr</a> and 15 minutes a day for
          roughly 30 days using
          <a href="https://www.typingclub.com">TypingClub</a>. That&#39;s only 11
          hours. But my typing speed was slower for at least a month after
          starting to use Workman at work. That&#39;s a lot of lost productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that I&#39;ve mastered the Workman layout, though, I&#39;ll stick with it!
