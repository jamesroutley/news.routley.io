<p><span><SPAN size="5"><b>How to Get Carl&#39;s Starter</b></SPAN></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>NOTE: OUR ADDRESS HAS CHANGED as of July 2022</strong></span></span></p>

<p><SPAN face="ariel"><SPAN size="3"><SPAN color="#800000"><SPAN size="4"><b>USA Residents</b></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p>

<p><span><span><SPAN><strong>Oregon Trail Sourdough</strong> </SPAN></span></span></p>

<p><SPAN face="ariel"><SPAN size="3">We <strong>require </strong>a  #10 envelope, also called, in the USA, a &#34;business-size envelope&#34;, measures about 9-1/2 inches by 4-1/8 inches (24 cm by 10.5 cm). European size DL is close enough. </SPAN></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="ariel"><SPAN size="3">If such an envelope is not available, simply send postage (or currency as below) plus your postal address, and we will provide an envelope. An address label is helpful but not required.<strong> </strong></SPAN></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="ariel"><SPAN size="3"><strong>Please, only 1 request per address. You can revive the starter and share it with house members.</strong></SPAN></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="ariel"><SPAN size="3"><strong><span>Please don&#39;t send huge or small envelopes </span></strong></SPAN><SPAN size="3"><SPAN><strong><span>for your SASE </span></strong></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN size="3"><strong><span>or send us empty envelopes. Empty envelopes will not be sent a starter.</span></strong></SPAN></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="ariel"><SPAN size="3"><strong><span><img alt="" src="https://carlsfriends.net/SASE%20example.jpg"/></span></strong></SPAN></SPAN><em> Example of SASE with starter sent to you for US addresses.</em></p>

<p><SPAN face="ariel"><SPAN size="3"> Please write your address carefully and neatly. When filled envelopes come back marked undeliverable, there&#39;s nothing we can do about it. </SPAN></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN color="#000000"><SPAN face="ariel"><SPAN size="3"> Normally, it could take up to six weeks for your start to get to you, but it probably won&#39;t. <a href="http://carlsfriends.net/postaldelay.html">See why</a>  </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p>



<p><SPAN color="#000000"><SPAN face="ariel"><SPAN size="3">Only one start is sent per envelope to better the chance of making it through the postal machines.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p>

<p><span><em>Note: The US Post Office seems to have periodoc slowdowns as some starts have been taking 2 months to arrive after we mail them and sometimes it seems they hold the requests and release them all at once. This has been happening since 2019 and we can&#39;t tell when it will happen or why. Please be patient with delivery as this is completely out of our control.</em></span></p>

<p><SPAN color="#800000"><SPAN face="ariel"><SPAN size="4"><b>Other Countries</b></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN color="#000000"> </SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN color="#000000"><SPAN face="ariel"><SPAN size="3">Our cost, including postage, for overseas mailings is ~$1.95. Your $2 remittance includes a donation of ~5¢ towards mailings to countries where U.S. currency cannot be found.) Otherwise, non-domestic requestors should contact a <a href="http://carlsfriends.net/feedback.html">volunteer</a> as we can accept PayPal at our email address. (You might want to do that before you pay an unreasonable price for an IRC.)  Any currency sent without an instruction will be treated as a donation. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="ariel"><SPAN size="3">Please be aware that we cannot use stamps issued by countries other than the US -- only US stamps are accepted by our post office and we cannot use non-US currency. </SPAN></SPAN></p>
