						<p>Firstly, I&#39;d like to express how appalled my team and I are by Adobes lack of service around this issue. We are now seeking help on this forum as we simply cannot get through to Adobe via phone/email. We&#39;ve been handed around to 13+ different representatives on the phone, we&#39;ve been transferred to numerous people and then hung up on, we’ve been put on hold and then hung up on, and we&#39;ve been provided a support email to contact (support@adobe.com) which does not work. This has been going on for about 3 weeks now. To say the least, we a absolutely disgusted by the support, so I really hope this reaches someone at Adobe or a community member who could kindly help us instead. </p><p>We have used the font <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/proxima-nova#licensing-section" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proxima Nova</a> on a website for our client using the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/nz/fonts/using/add-fonts-website.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Web Project</a> method. Our client is now being harassed and threatened by a company called The Type Founders who claim to work on behalf of the owner of the font (who we believe are legitimate). They are claiming that we have illegally downloaded the font Proxima Nova, and are incorrectly using it by ‘self hosting’. We have access to this font through Adobe Fonts, and are using it on this website through Adobe Web Project (as mentioned). This company are claiming that we need to purchase the font in order to continue using it. Just to note, since this issue arose we have removed the font temporarily until the matter is resolved.</p><p>The one useful Adobe representative we spoke to on the phone last week mentioned that numerous people are having trouble with the Adobe licencing with this particular font. She said that Adobe may not have the appropriate licencing for this font listed on the website – unsure if this is reliable information or not, but thought I’d mention, as if this is the case, there should be more information clearly visible on the font’s webpage about how to use it correctly.</p><p>From our understanding, we have used the font in the correct way (according to the Adobe Web Project method). However, our client does not have an Adobe subscription, so we concerned that we are not covered by the Adobe licence due to this: <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/fonts/using/font-licensing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://helpx.adobe.com/fonts/using/font-licensing.html</a>.</p><p>What we’d like to know is, have we used the font incorrectly and what can we do? Is this company ‘The Type Founders’ even legitimate like we believe them to be or should we just ingore their email? Our client is intimidated and stressed, and we’d like to have a clear answer for them.</p><p>We’d also like to know how other studios around the globe use Adobe fonts on client websites. Do your clients create Adobe accounts every time you use an Adobe font on their website?</p><p>We’d really appreciate some help on this. Thank you.</p>
