<p>What&#39;s SAP? And why is it worth $163B?</p>
<p>Every year companies spend $41B on <strong>enterprise resource planning</strong> software, commonly known as <strong>ERP</strong>. Today, almost every large business has some sort of ERP system implemented. But most smaller businesses generally don’t purchase any ERP system off the shelf, and most engineers probably haven’t seen them in the wild. So for those of us who haven’t used an ERP system ourselves… what’s the big deal? How does a company like SAP sell $25B worth of ERP software every year? And how does <a href="https://www.sap.com/corporate/en/company.html">77% of the world’s transaction revenue</a>, and 78% of the world’s food all flow through SAP?</p>
<p>ERP is where companies store their core operational data. We’re talking about sales projections, purchase orders, and inventory, as well as the processes that act upon that data (e.g. paying out vendors when a purchase order is issued). In a sense, ERP is the “brain” of a company — it stores all important pieces of data and all of the actions possible in data-driven workflows.</p>
<p>But before taking over the modern business world, how did ERP software get started? The story of ERP begins with major automation efforts of the 1960s: while the 1940s and 50s were focused on mechanical automation of blue collar work — think General Motors establishing their automation department in 1947 — the automation of white collar work (often via the computer!) began in the 1960s.</p>
<h2 id="midcenturyautomationcomputersenterindustry">Midcentury automation: Computers enter industry</h2>
<p>Payroll and billing were among the first business processes that computers automated. Employers needed armies of white-collar labor to manually tally employee hours in ledgers, manually multiply hours with hourly rates, and manually subtract taxes and benefit deductions… all just to run a single month of payroll! This time-consuming, repetitive process was error-prone for humans, and was a natural fit for computerized automation.</p>
<p>By the 1960s, many companies used IBM computers to automate payroll and billing tasks. Data processing – an outdated term whose lasting legacy is</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.rowan.earth/blog/content/images/2019/11/early_eng.jpg" width="600"/></p><p>Programming for automation/data processing was challenging in the 1960s because of memory constraints. There were no high level languages, no standardized operating systems, and no personal computers – only big expensive mainframes with little memory running programs on reels of data tape! Programmers often developed at night in order to maximize compile time. It was common for companies like GM to write their own operating systems to get the most out of their mainframes.</p>
<p>While today we run application software on top of a few common operating systems, this wasn’t the case until the 1990s. During the <a href="https://www.authorhouse.com/BookStore/BookDetails/230036-Computing-in-the-Middle-Ages">middle ages of computing on mainframe machines</a>, 90% of all software sold was custom-built; only 10% was purchased off the shelf.</p>
<p>This landscape deeply influenced how companies developed their technology. Some imagined that the future of software would involve industry-standardized hardware, OS, and programming languages, like <a href="https://tryretool.com/blog/air-travel-software/">the SABRE system</a> for the airline industry (that’s still used today!). Most companies stuck to building their own completely isolated software, often reinventing the wheel.</p>
<h2 id="thebirthofstandardsoftwaresapsextensibledevelopment">The birth of standard software: SAP’s extensible development</h2>
<p>In 1972, five engineers left their jobs at IBM to pursue a software contract with a large chemical firm called ICI. Their new company, SAP (Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung, or System Analysis and Program Development in English), like most software companies at the time, was essentially a software consultancy. SAP would embed themselves in their customers’ offices and develop on their customers’ computers, writing mostly logistics management software.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.rowan.earth/blog/content/images/2019/11/sap_history_founders_001_t_40900x589_920715.jpg" width="600"/></p><p>Business went well: SAP ended their first year with DM620,000 in revenue, a little over $1M in today’s dollars. Soon, they started selling their software to additional customers, porting it to different operating systems when necessary. Over the next four years, they acquired over 40 customers, 6x-ed their revenue, and grew from 9 to 25 employees. This might be a far cry from today’s coveted <a href="https://blog.fusebill.com/t2d3-path-to-saas-growth-1b-valuation">T2D3 growth curve</a>, but SAP’s future was bright.</p>
<p>SAP’s software was special for a few reasons. At the time, most software ran overnight and produced output on paper data tapes, which you’d check the next morning. Instead, SAP designed their software to produce output in real-time for customers, and ran it on computer monitors (which cost around $30K at the time).</p>
<p>But most importantly, SAP’s software was designed to be extensible from the start. For SAP’s original contract with ICI, SAP didn’t build software from scratch, as was the norm at the time, and instead built on top of a previous project. When SAP released their financial accounting software in 1974, their intention was to build additional software modules on top of it and sell them in the future. This extensibility was SAP’s defining feature. The interoperability across client contexts was considered radical at the time  because other approaches started from scratch for every client.</p>
<h2 id="theimportanceofintegration">The importance of integration</h2>
<p>When SAP introduced their second software module for manufacturing to go with their first finance module, the two modules were able to seamlessly interact with each other since they shared the same database. This integration made the combination of the two modules significantly more valuable than the individual pieces of software.</p>
<p>As software automated particular business processes, its impact was highly dependent on access to data. Purchase order data sits in the sales software, inventory data sits in the warehousing software, etc. And because these systems don’t interact, they needed to be synced regularly, and that often meant having a human manually move data around.</p>
<p>Integrated software solves this by facilitating communication across company systems and enabling new kinds of automation. This kind of integration – between various business processes, as well as data sources – is a key feature of ERP systems. This became especially important as hardware spoke more to software, opening new automation opportunities; and ERP shined.</p>
<p>The speed at which data can be accessed with integrated software empowered companies to <a href="http://facweb.cti.depaul.edu/jnowotarski/is425/hbr%20enterprise%20systems%20davenport%201998%20jul-aug.pdf">completely rehaul their business models</a>. For Compaq, ERP allowed them to shift their distribution strategy to a made-to-order model (i.e. building a computer only once the order is explicitly placed). This model saves money by eliminating inventory cost, but relies on a speedy turn-around time — precisely what a good ERP implementation helps with. When IBM underwent a similar effort, it reduced replacement part shipping time from 22 days to only 3 days!</p>
