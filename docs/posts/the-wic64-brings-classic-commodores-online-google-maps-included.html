    <h1>The WiC64 Brings Classic Commodores Online, Google Maps Included</h1>

        <p>A computing platform is never really dead unless people stop developing new software for it. By that measure, the Commodore 64 is alive and well: new games, demos, and utilities are still being released on a regular basis. Getting those new programs onto an old computer was always a bit of a hassle though, requiring either an SD card adapter for the Commodore or a direct cable connection from an internet-connected PC. Luckily, there’s now a simpler way to get your latest software updates thanks to a WiFi adapter called WiC64.  This adapter plugs into the expansion port of a classic Commodore and lets you download programs directly into memory. [Tommy Ovesen] over at [Arctic Retro] bought one and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14giLbM4rhk" target="_blank">explored its many features</a>.</p>
<p>The basic design of <a href="https://www.wic64.de/" target="_blank">the WiC64</a> is straightforward: an ESP32 mounted on an adapter board that connects its data bus to that of the Commodore 64, 128 or VIC-20. A simple program, which you still need to transfer the old way, lets you configure the device and connect to a WiFi network. Once that’s done, an interactive BBS-style program is launched that allows you to access a range of online services. The WiC64 developers provide these, but since the system is fully open-source there’s nothing stopping you from running your own servers as well.</p>

There’s also a direct link to <a href="https://csdb.dk/" target="_blank">CSDB</a>, an online database of Commodore 64 programs and demos which you can now simply download and run directly on your C64 – in effect, a modern app store for a classic computer.</p>
<p>One feature that really seems to defy the C64’s hardware limitations is a fully functional version of Google Maps. Even with the Commodore’s limited resolution and color depth, it does a pretty decent job of showing maps, satellite photos, and even Street View images.</p>
<p>Using the WiC64 requires no hardware modifications to the Commodore 64, but a custom ROM is available that enables a few convenient features such as <code>LOAD</code>ing programs directly from a web address. There have been several attempts at <a href="https://hackaday.com/2015/12/21/giving-the-c64-a-wifi-modem/">getting classic Commodores online</a>, but none so far that managed to get complex apps like Google Maps running. We have seen <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/07/01/blixterm-brings-full-speed-youtube-video-to-the-commodore-pet/">YouTube videos being played on a Commodore PET though</a>.</p>
