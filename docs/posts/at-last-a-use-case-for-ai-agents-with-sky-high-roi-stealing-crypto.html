    <h1>At last, a use case for AI agents with sky-high ROI: Stealing crypto</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Using AI models to generate exploits for cryptocurrency contract flaws appears to be a promising business model, though not necessarily a legal one.</p>
<p>Researchers with University College London (UCL) and the University of Sydney (USYD) in Australia have devised an AI agent that can autonomously discover and exploit vulnerabilities in so-called smart contracts.</p>
<p>Smart contracts, which have never lived up to their name, are self-executing programs on various blockchains that carry out decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions when certain conditions are met.</p>

<p>A system like A1 can turn a profit</p>

<p>Like most programs of sufficient complexity, smart contracts have bugs, and exploiting those bugs to steal funds can be remunerative. Last year, the cryptocurrency industry lost almost $1.5 billion to hacking attacks, according to Web3 security platform vendor <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/t3wqy70tc3bv/2LqNkvjajiCS5sPJmWLakc/9715af967dd95a55da05d2ad373edb0d/Immunefi_Crypto_Losses_in_2024_Report.pdf">Immunefi</a> [PDF]. Since 2017, crims have pilfered around <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://defillama.com/hacks">$11.74 billion</a> from DeFi platforms.</p>
<p>And it looks like AI agents can make taking those funds even easier.</p>

    

<p>Arthur Gervais, associate professor in information security at UCL, and Liyi Zhou, a lecturer in computer science at USYD, have developed an AI agent system called A1 that uses various AI models from OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, and Alibaba (Qwen) to develop exploits for <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html">Solidity smart contracts</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>They describe the system in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05558">preprint paper</a> titled, &#34;AI Agent Smart Contract Exploit Generation.&#34;</p>
<p>Given a set of target parameters – the blockchain, contract address, and block number – the agent chooses tools and collects information to understand the contract&#39;s behavior and vulnerabilities. It then generates exploits in the form of compilable Solidity contracts, which it tests against historical blockchain states.</p>

        

<p>If prompted to fund vulnerabilities in code, LLMs can find bugs – but they often invent phantom flaws in such numbers that open source projects like curl have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/07/curl_ai_bug_reports/">banned</a> the submission of AI-generated vulnerability reports.</p>
<p>So the A1 agent system consists of a set of tools to make its exploits more reliable. These include: a source coding fetcher that can resolve <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://medium.com/@social_42205/proxy-contracts-in-solidity-f6f5ffe999bd">proxy contracts</a>, and individual tools for initializing parameters, reading contact functions, sanitizing code, testing code execution, and calculating revenue.</p>
<p>&#34;A1 performs full exploit generation,&#34; Zhou told <em>The Register</em> in an email. &#34;This is important. This is unlike other LLM security tools. The output is not just a report, but actual executable code. A1 is really close to a human hacker.&#34;</p>

        

<p>Tested on 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains, A1 demonstrated a 62.96 percent (17 out of 27) success rate on the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/wtdcode/verite">VERITE</a> benchmark.</p>
<p>According to the authors, A1 also spotted nine additional vulnerable contracts, five of which occurred after the training cutoff of the best performing model, OpenAI&#39;s o3-pro. That&#39;s relevant because it indicates that the model isn&#39;t just regurgitating vulnerability information made available during training.</p>
<p>&#34;Across all 26 successful cases, A1 extracts up to 8.59 million USD per case and 9.33 million USD total,&#34; the paper reports. &#34;Through 432 experiments across six LLMs, we analyze iteration-wise performance showing diminishing returns with average marginal gains of +9.7 percent, +3.7 percent, +5.1 percent, and +2.8 percent for iterations 2-5 respectively, with per-experiment costs ranging $0.01−$3.59.&#34;</p>

</ul>
<p>The researchers tested A1 with various LLMs: o3-pro (OpenAI o3-pro, o3-pro-2025-06-10), o3 (OpenAI o3, o3-2025-04-16), Gemini Pro (Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, gemini-2.5-pro), Gemini Flash (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 05-20:thinking, gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17), R1 (DeepSeek R1-0528), and Qwen3 MoE (Qwen3-235B-A22B).</p>
<p>OpenAI’s o3-pro and o3 had the highest success rates, 88.5 percent and 73.1 percent respectively, given a five-turn budget for the model to interact with itself in the agent loop. And the o3 models did so while maintaining high revenue optimization, getting 69.2 percent and 65.4 percent of the maximum revenue from the exploited contracts.</p>
<p>Exploits of this sort can also be identified using manual code analysis alongside static and dynamic fuzzing tools. But the authors observe that manual methods have limits, due to the volume and complexity of smart contracts, the slowness and scarcity of human security experts, and the high false positive rates of existing automated tools.</p>
<p>In theory, A1 could be deployed and earn more from exploits than it costs to operate, assuming law enforcement did not step in.</p>
<p>&#34;A system like A1 can turn a profit,&#34; Zhou explained. &#34;To give a concrete example [from the paper], Figure 5 shows that o3-pro remains profitable even if only 1 out of every 1000 scans leads to a real vulnerability – as long as that vulnerability was introduced in the last 30 days.&#34;</p>

<p>Zhou said that the time window matters because researchers are more likely to have found older vulnerabilities and users may have patched them.</p>
<p>&#34;Finding such fresh bugs is not easy, but it’s possible, especially at scale. Once a few valuable exploits are discovered, they can easily pay for the cost of running thousands of scans. And as AI models continue to improve, we expect both the chance of finding these vulnerabilities and the range of contracts covered to increase — making the system even more effective over time.&#34;</p>
<p>Asked whether A1 has spotted any zero-day vulnerabilities in the wild, Zhou replied, &#34;No zero-days for this paper (yet).&#34;</p>
<p>The paper concludes by warning about the 10x asymmetry between the rewards of attacking compared to the rewards of defending – if the attackers use AI tools and defenders use traditional tools. Essentially, the authors are arguing that either bug bounty payouts need to approach exploit value, or the cost of defensive scanning has to drop by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>&#34;Finding one vulnerability requires approximately 1,000 scans, costing $3,000,&#34; the paper states. &#34;A $100k exploit would fund 33k future scans for an attacker, while a defender’s $10k bounty only covers 3.3k. This order of magnitude difference in reinvestment capability leads to diverging scanning capacities.&#34;</p>
<p>The risk of imprisonment may shift calculations somewhat. But given the current regulatory climate in the US and an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thirdway.org/report/to-catch-a-hacker-toward-a-comprehensive-strategy-to-identify-pursue-and-punish-malicious-cyber-actors">estimated cybercrime enforcement rate of 0.05 percent</a>, it would be a small risk adjustment.</p>
<p>Zhou argues that the cost gap between attacking and defending represents a serious challenge.</p>
<p>&#34;My recommendation is that project teams should use tools like A1 themselves to continuously monitor their own protocol, rather than waiting for third parties to find issues,&#34; he said. &#34;The utility for project teams and attackers is the entire TVL [Total Value Locked of the smart contract], while whitehat rewards are often capped at 10 percent.”</p>
<p>&#34;That asymmetry makes it hard to compete without proactive security. If you rely on third-party teams, you’re essentially trusting that they’ll act in good faith and stay within the 10 percent bounty — which, from a security perspective, is a very strange assumption. I typically assume all players are financially rational when modeling security problems.&#34;</p>
<p>The researchers in the July 8 draft of their paper indicated that they were planning to release A1 as open source code. But Zhou said otherwise when asked about source code availability.</p>
<p>&#34;We’ve removed the mention of open source (arXiv will show tomorrow) as we’re not yet sure whether it’s the right move, given how powerful A1 is and the above concerns,&#34; he said. ®</p>
