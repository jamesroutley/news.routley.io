    <h4><span>Why</span> I built captrice?</h4>
    <p>
      If you have 30 minutes of free time, would you pick up your
      guitar or phone? The path of least resistence always wins!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you picked the guitar, you&#39;d probably noodle away
      instead of practicing something that advances your skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The challenge isn&#39;t finding what to practiceâ€”today,
      exercises are everywhereâ€”it&#39;s choosing practice over the
      endless distractions we have at our fingertips.
    </p>
    <p>
      I built this app to solve my own struggle - curated exercises
      eliminate indecision about what to pratice, the metronome keeps
      me focused, and data visualizations helps with motivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It works for me and it might work for you too.

    <h3>Who is behind this?</h3>
    <p>
      I am Vineet Naik, a software engineer and hobbyist guitar player
      from Bangalore, India.
    </p>
    <p>
      I picked up the guitar in 2001 and somehow the hobby has
      stuck. I played in a few amateur bands during college. Since
      then, I have pretty much been a bedroom musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, I am always on the lookout for new ways to
      practice and level up, which is what this project was born out
      of.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
