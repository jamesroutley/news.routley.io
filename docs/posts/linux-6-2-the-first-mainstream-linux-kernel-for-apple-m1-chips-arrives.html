And, for techies, that&#39;s sexy. </p><p>Getting Linux to run on the M1 family wasn&#39;t easy. </p><p>When these high-powered ARM chips first arrived, Torvalds told me in an exclusive interview that he&#39;d like to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-would-like-to-use-an-m1-mac-for-linux-but/" rel="follow">run Linux on these next-generation Macs</a>. But, while he&#39;d been &#34;waiting for an ARM laptop that can run Linux for a long time,&#34; he worried, saying, &#34;The main problem with the M1 for me is the GPU and other devices around it because that&#39;s likely what would hold me off using it because it wouldn&#39;t have any Linux support unless Apple opens up.&#34;</p><p>Fortunately, <a href="https://asahilinux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Asahi Linux</a>, with brilliant software engineer <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Alyssa Rosenzweig,</a> was up to the challenge. By July 31, 2022, <a href="https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2207.3/07437.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Torvalds was pleased to announce</a> that after &#34;waiting for a _loong_ time, [Linux on ARM and the M1 in specific was] finally reality, thanks to the Asahi team. We&#39;ve had arm64 hardware around running Linux for a long time, but none of it has really been usable as a development platform until now.&#34;</p><p>Today, this support is finally ready for mainline Linux users. Of course, it&#39;s all experimental at this point, but it won&#39;t be for much longer. Linux 6.2 is expected to become Ubuntu 23.04&#39;s default kernel and to be included in Fedora 38 before the late April release of Linux 6.3.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/sparkylinux-is-a-no-frills-linux-distribution-anyone-can-use/" rel="follow"><strong>SparkyLinux is a no-frills Linux distribution anyone can use</strong></a></p><p>In the meantime, the 2022 <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-6-1-stable-lands-as-linus-torvalds-frets-over-a-frantic-pre-holidays-6-2-merge/" rel="follow">Long Term Support (LTS) kernel, Linux 6.1</a>, will continue to be maintained until at least the end of 2026. Fixes from the 6.2 release are expected to be back-ported to 6.1.</p><p>In addition, the Linux 6.2 kernel includes numerous features with contributions from companies such as Intel, AMD, Google, and Red Hat. Notable additions include stable support for <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/discrete-gpus/arc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Intel Arc Graphics (DG2/Alchemist)</a> enabled out of the box and initial support for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series</a> &#34;Ampere&#34; accelerated graphics with <a href="https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nouveau open-source code</a>. The Linux 6.2 kernel also includes updated drivers. This includes support for Sony DualShock 4 gamepads, sensors, and fans in the OneXPlayer gaming handheld, Habana Labs&#39; Gaudi2 AI accelerator, and Asus motherboards.  </p><p>This new kernel also includes <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/8735ezye00.ffs@tglx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Call Depth Tracking</a> to help improve performance on older Intel Skylake-era PCs, along with various file-system driver enhancements and security improvements. In addition to new hardware support, the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/ntfs3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">NTFS3 file kernel driver</a> has also been improved and updated with new mount options.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-linux-on-your-raspberry-pi/" rel="follow"><strong>How to install Linux on your Raspberry Pi</strong></a></p><p>Overall, the Linux 6.2 kernel offers significant new hardware enablement and features. But, the real news, as far as I&#39;m concerned, is the M1 support. This is a game changer for Linux Mac users.</p><!----></div></div></div>
