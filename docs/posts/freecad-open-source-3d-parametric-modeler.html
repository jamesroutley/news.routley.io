        <h3>Freedom to build what you want</h3>
        <p>
          FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to
          design real-life objects of any size. Parametric modeling allows you
          to easily modify your design by going back into your model history
          and changing its parameters.        </p>

        <h3>Create 3D from 2D &amp; back</h3>
        <p>
          FreeCAD allows you to sketch geometry constrained 2D shapes and use
          them as a base to build other objects. It contains many components
          to adjust dimensions or extract design details from 3D models to
          create high quality production ready drawings.        </p>

        <h3>Accessible, flexible &amp; integrated</h3>
        <p>
          FreeCAD is a multiplatfom (Windows, Mac and Linux), highly
          customizable and extensible software. It reads and writes to many
          open file formats such as STEP, IGES, STL, SVG, DXF, OBJ, IFC, DAE
          and many others, making it possible to seamlessly integrate it into
          your workflow.        </p>

        <h3>Designed for your needs</h3>
        <p>
          FreeCAD is designed to fit a wide range of uses including product
          design, mechanical engineering and architecture. Whether you are a
          hobbyist, a programmer, an experienced CAD user, a student or a
          teacher, you will feel right at home with FreeCAD.        </p>

        <h3>And many more great features</h3>
        <p>
          FreeCAD equips you with all the right tools for your needs. You get
          modern Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tools, experimental CFD, dedicated BIM,
          Geodata or CAM/CNC workbenches, a robot simulation module that
          allows you to study robot movements and many more features. FreeCAD
          really is a Swiss Army knife of general-purpose engineering
          toolkits.        </p>
