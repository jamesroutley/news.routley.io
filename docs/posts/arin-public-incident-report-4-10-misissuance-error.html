    <h1>ARIN Public Incident Report – 4.10 Misissuance Error</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-text">
      <p><strong>Posted: Friday, 12 December 2025</strong> </p>
      
      
      <h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>On 2 December 2025, an IPv4 block 23.150.164.0/24, correctly allocated to the Original Customer, was inadvertently removed and reissued to the Requesting Customer during a 4.10 allocation process. This error stemmed from the current manual and partially offline 4.10 inventory process.</p>
<p>The incorrect state persisted until 9 December 2025, when the Original Customer reported the issue. ARIN restored the 23.150.164.0/24 to the Original Customer, issued a replacement /24 to the Requesting Customer, coordinated withdrawal of the incorrect route announcement, and notified the affected parties.</p>
<p>This incident highlights known weaknesses in ARIN’s current Internet Number Resources (INR) Inventory handling for 4.10 transition space and underscores the need to complete the transition to a fully automated, integrated online inventory architecture.</p>
<h2 id="incident-description">Incident Description</h2>
<p>Following the current allocation process for 4.10 space, an RSD analyst:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relied on legacy/manual 4.10 inventory artifacts, including a flat file and sparse allocation spreadsheet</li>
<li>Did not recognize indicators in ARIN Online showing that 23.150.164.0/24 was already allocated to the Original Customer</li>
<li>Removed 23.150.164.0/24 from the Original Customer</li>
<li>Reissued that same /24 to the Requesting Customer</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the registration record and associated ROAs for the Original Customer were deleted in error, and the /24 appeared as allocated to the Requesting Customer in ARIN’s systems.</p>
<h2 id="customer-impact-and-risk">Customer Impact and Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li>The /24 was removed from the Original Customer account and assigned to another organization.</li>
<li>The ROA associated with the block was removed and had to be recreated after restoration.</li>
<li>The block was announced by a third-party provider under the incorrect registration, introducing risk of routing conflict and confusion.</li>
<li>The incorrect state persisted for approximately seven days before detection.</li>
<li>The Original Customer reported the issue via Ask ARIN and a Help Desk call on 9 December 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>The customer has not provided a technical impact statement.</p>

<h3 id="25-26-november-2025">25–26 November 2025</h3>
<ul>
<li>25 November, 11:59 AM – 4.10 space request received from the Requesting Customer.</li>
<li>26 November, 6:25 AM – Ticket assigned to an RSD Analyst for processing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-december-2025-incident-occurs">2 December 2025 – Incident Occurs</h3>
<ul>
<li>12:10 PM – Ticket approved for issuance of 4.10 space by designated RSD Analyst.</li>
<li>~12:10–12:30 PM – In the process of fulfilling the 4.10 request, the designated Analyst:
<ul>
<li>Opened the e-black-book (an offline Excel-based inventory file, separate from the primary online inventory system), reviewed the existing 4.10 allocations, and selected 23.150.164.0 as the next available sparse entry.</li>
<li>Returned to the ARIN Online management application and queried for 23.150.164.0 based on the entry identified in the e-black-book. At this time the analyst did not recognize that the /24 was already allocated to the Original Customer.</li>
<li>Performed a block split and deleted 23.150.164.0/24 – not recognizing that it was allocated to the Original Customer – which removed associated registry services (ROAs, reverse DNS, etc.).</li>
<li>Issued 23.150.164.0/24 to the Requesting Customer.</li>
</ul>

<li>12:01 PM – Corrective actions completed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="root-cause">Root Cause</h2>
<p>A manual 4.10 workflow that relies on a combination of online systems and offline flat files/spreadsheets for inventory management allowed a current customer allocation to be mistakenly identified as available for issuance. This reliance on offline spreadsheets is a legacy constraint where post-runout 4.10 inventory is maintained outside the primary online system to keep it reserved. The lack of a unified view of inventory and related business-rule-driven system controls enabled the error to proceed without detection.</p>
<h2 id="contributing-factors">Contributing Factors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid inventory architecture (online + offline) for 4.10 space.</li>
<li>Sparse allocation methods implemented through manual tools rather than integrated system logic.</li>
<li>Generic warning messages that are not routing aware or business-rule driven.</li>
<li>High demand on analysts to catch procedural errors in a manual “swivel chair” workflow.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mitigation-plan-and-next-steps">Mitigation Plan and Next Steps</h2>
<h3 id="immediate-near-term-controls-completed">Immediate / Near-Term Controls (Completed)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Updated Process Controls (completed)</strong>
<ul>
<li>RSD has implemented additional process controls that require a dual review for all ticketing type workflows that include a network delete.</li>
<li>Only a limited set of experienced analysts are permitted to perform this function.</li>
<li>Reviews and approvals are performed at set times each day with a second reviewer involved for any ticket that includes a delete step.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Updated 4.10 Issuing Playbook</strong>
<ul>
<li>Document and enforce a revised playbook for issuing 4.10 (with checklists) that includes:
<ul>
<li>Required checks for existing allocations and ROAs</li>
<li>Explicit verification steps prior to any delete/reissue action</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="system-and-architecture-improvements-medium-term">System and Architecture Improvements (Medium-Term)</h3>
<p><strong>Accelerate the ongoing INR Inventory Management Roadmap item:</strong> This incident reinforces the urgency of the architecture work already underway (reviewed Oct 2025) to move legacy offline inventories into a modern, online architecture. Specific alignment actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stronger business rule–based warnings and controls</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enhance warning logic when issuing or modifying 4.10 space to include:
<ul>
<li>Clear alerts if the /24 is already allocated to an Org</li>
<li>Clear alerts if active ROAs exist for the exact block or covering prefix</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement system controls for resource types and staff roles, with flags and audit trails for review and auditing.</li>
<li>Replace generic, non–ROA-aware warnings that are easily treated as noise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Continue Engineering solution for offline inventory</strong>
<ul>
<li>Move offline 4.10 and microallocation inventories, and the viip file for IPv6, into the integrated online inventory architecture.</li>
<li>Eliminate reliance on separate spreadsheets and flat files for production issuing.</li>
<li>Implement business-rule-driven warnings for existing allocations and ROAs</li>
<li>Introduce role-based controls, flags, and audit trails</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advance the “Updated Resource Status Taxonomy” work</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ensure 4.10 status and history are fully visible and consistent inside the primary system.</li>
<li>Provide analysts with a clear, unified view of current holder, status, and ROA/IRR context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fast-track automation of all inventory issuing</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduce or eliminate manual issuing where possible, with priority for higher-risk categories such as 4.10 and RPKI-covered space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
