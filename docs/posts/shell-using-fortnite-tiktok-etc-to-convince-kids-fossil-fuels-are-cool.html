I think we can all agree on that. But for kids, who have long lives and futures ahead of them, the prospect of the planet turning into a nightmare sphere of extreme weather and chaos is particularly scary. But don’t worry about all that, kids. Instead, Shell—a massive oil company and one of the many entities directly responsible for destroying our planet—wants you all to know just how rad its fossil fuel products are, and even made a whole <em>Fortnite </em>world for you to enjoy! But to truly enjoy it, you’ll need to use Shell’s V-Power® NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline, of course.<br/></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.mediamatters.org/climate-deniers/after-decades-climate-deception-shell-uses-fortnite-court-demographic-most&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.mediamatters.org/climate-deniers/after-decades-climate-deception-shell-uses-fortnite-court-demographic-most" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>Media Matters</em> earlier this week</a></span>, Shell has partnered with map creators to develop “<span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.shell.us/motorist/shell-ultimate-road-trips-sweepstakes.html#&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.shell.us/motorist/shell-ultimate-road-trips-sweepstakes.html#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shell Ultimate Road Trips</a></span>”, a <em>Fortnite </em>world featuring six different areas to explore in the car of your choice.

As far as I can tell, not great. For example, looking at that <em>IGN </em>article, it’s got only two comments and both are negative.

It’s hard to sell gasoline and diesel to teens who know it’s destroying the planet and their futures. And it doesn’t look like some Instagram models and <em>Fortnite </em>videos on <em>IGN </em>promoting Shell are going to be enough to change their minds. <br/></p><p>  <!-- -->.<br/></p></div></div>
