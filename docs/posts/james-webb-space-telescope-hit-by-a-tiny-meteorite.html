The contact left a &#34;dimple&#34; in the segment, Nasa <a href="https://twitter.com/joroulette/status/1534853245859942401?s=20&amp;t=nVSbVjVM4iWHBIDqXKKwdg">told the Reuters news agency</a>. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The speed at which things move through space means even the smallest particles can impart a lot of energy when colliding with another object. Webb has now been hit five times with this latest event being the most significant.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Webb has an open design; its mirrors are not guarded by the kind of tubular baffle seen on other space telescopes, such as Hubble. Instead, the reflectors sit behind one giant sunshield that allows them to maintain the stable, cold temperatures needed to detect infrared light. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The possibility of micrometeoroid hits was anticipated and contingencies like this were incorporated into the choice of materials, the construction of components and the different modes of operating the telescope.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We always knew that Webb would have to weather the space environment, which includes harsh ultraviolet light and charged particles from the Sun, cosmic rays from exotic sources in the galaxy, and occasional strikes by micrometeoroids within our Solar System,&#34; said Paul Geithner, technical deputy project manager at Nasa&#39;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We designed and built Webb with performance margin - optical, thermal, electrical, mechanical - to ensure it can perform its ambitious science mission even after many years in space.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>NASA</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Webb&#39;s primary reflector has 18 segments and is 6.5m wide</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Engineers will adjust the positioning of the affected mirror segment to cancel out a portion of the introduced distortion, but they can&#39;t remove it all. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Webb is currently gathering observations of the Universe, near and far, to demonstrate its capabilities. Astronomers will present these pictures to the world next month. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Longer term, the scientists intend to use Webb to try to see the very first stars to light up the cosmos more that 13.5 billion years ago. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They&#39;ll also train the telescope&#39;s big &#34;eye&#34; on the atmospheres of distant planets to see if those worlds might be habitable.</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
