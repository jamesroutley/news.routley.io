    <p>New research within the HYBRIT project shows superior results on the properties and quality of the hydrogen direct reduced sponge iron compared to the fossil-based process. The test results prove that the direct reduction with hydrogen produces a product that is easy to handle, transport and store, in addition to the fact that the process virtually eliminates CO2-emissions.</p>


    

    <div><p>The HYBRIT initiative was started by SSAB, LKAB and Vattenfall to develop a new technology for hydrogen based iron- and steelmaking with the aim to establish a fossil-free value chain from the mine to finished steel product. In June 2021, the HYBRIT-initiative succeeded in producing the world´s first hydrogen direct reduced sponge iron at the pilot plant built with support from the Swedish Energy Agency.</p>

<p>New test results from the HYBRIT reveal that direct reduced iron (DRI) with hydrogen creates a product with significantly improved properties and quality. Hydrogen-reduced carbon-free DRI is highly metallized and has superior mechanical and aging properties compared to direct reduced iron using fossil-based reducing gas such as natural gas. Hybrit Development AB has filed patent applications describing the included inventions to the European Patent Office.</p>

<p>“We are very pleased with and proud by the consistency in the good results and excited by the opportunities this can offer to the steel industry´s green transition. Thanks to years of dedicated work from the research team, we have made the hydrogen-based pathway to decarbonize steelmaking more accessible and efficient. It can help to mitigate climate change,” says <strong>Martin</strong> <strong>Pei</strong>, CTO of SSAB and member of the Hybrit board. </p>

<p>“These extraordinary test results confirm that we are on the right track in establishing an efficient fossil-free value chain in the iron and steel industry. One element behind the high quality of the sponge iron produced is the high-quality iron ore from LKAB’s mine, which together with the groundbreaking HYBRIT technology paves the way for future fossil-free steelmaking. The HYBRIT pilot project continues to provide us with invaluable research as we continue the journey towards industrial production, starting first with a demonstration facility in Gällivare in 2026,” says <strong>Lars</strong> <strong>Ydreskog</strong>, SVP Strategic Projects LKAB and Chairman of the Hybrit board.</p>

<p>“It is very encouraging to see that these results not only confirms the climate benefits of replacing fossil fuels with hydrogen from fossil-free electricity, but also that decarbonization can actually lead to better industrial processes and products. This new knowledge is a direct result of close value chain cooperation, determined innovative thinking and bold efforts in piloting new technology – a recipe to copy for other industrial sectors,” says <strong>Andreas</strong> <strong>Regnell</strong>, Senior Vice President and Head of Strategic Development at Vattenfall and member of the Hybrit board.</p>
