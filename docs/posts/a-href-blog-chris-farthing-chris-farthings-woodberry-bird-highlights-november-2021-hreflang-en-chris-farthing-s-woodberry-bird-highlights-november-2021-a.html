    <div><p>November is usually a settled month here. Migration season is generally all-but over, and birds are settled in to their overwintering areas. This can change if we get any severe weather, but this November, like most others in recent times, was mild. One thing that was slightly different this year, possibly a hangover from the cold weather at the start of the spring migration season, was that autumn migration was late. Some species that usually peak here in October were more numerous in November this year. The biggest day for wood pigeon migration was the 2nd when over 1000 birds passed over, and redwing peaked at around 200 on the 16th. 25 Fieldfare and two meadow pipit also flew through on the 14th. Brambling are never an easy bird to see here, but a small flock of five passed over noisily on the 2nd, the first of the species this year.</p></div>

          <div><div><p>We had two other new birds for 2021 in November. A <strong>woodcock</strong> was seen to fly low west across the reservoir on the 9<sup>th</sup>. This species is seen here around once a year or a bit less, with November being the most likely time (the first full moon in November is sometimes known as the woodcock moon).</p>
<p>On the 8<sup>th</sup> a female <strong>pheasant (above)</strong> was seen in the area of cleared reed-bed, and didn’t stay long, but a couple of weeks later presumably the same bird was seen again, and from then on it became very regular, apparently co-existing happily with the local fox population around the woodland trail!</p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>The only other significant highlight in the month was a <strong>red kite (above)</strong> which was seen on the 4<sup>th</sup>. This may be the first year that they have been seen more often than buzzards.</p>
<p>The accumulation of <strong>mute swans (below)</strong> which had started in October continued through November and by the end of the month 22 were present on the reservoir as well as the family of seven on the New River.</p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>Other news from wildfowl were the continued high counts of <strong>gadwall</strong>, peaking at around 80, but<strong> shoveler</strong> numbers dwindling to low single figures. <strong>Teal</strong> peaked at six on the 30<sup>th</sup>. The high water levels meant that both <strong>water rail </strong>and <strong>snipe</strong> were again very difficult to see, with most records of the former being heard-only, and a peak count of only three of the latter being seen.</p>
<p>Some warm weather at the end of the month meant some birds were singing, with <strong>song thrushes</strong> being heard most days for the last week of the month. A <strong>mistle thrush</strong> was seen on the 23<sup>rd</sup>, the first for a good few months.</p>
<p>The total number of bird species seen here in November 2021 was 63, higher than average for the last five years and only one behind the best total of 64 in November 2016.</p>
