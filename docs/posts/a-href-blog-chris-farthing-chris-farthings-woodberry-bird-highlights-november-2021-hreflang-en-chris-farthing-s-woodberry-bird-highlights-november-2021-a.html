          <div><div><p>Other news from wildfowl were the continued high counts of <strong>gadwall</strong>, peaking at around 80, but<strong> shoveler</strong> numbers dwindling to low single figures. <strong>Teal</strong> peaked at six on the 30<sup>th</sup>. The high water levels meant that both <strong>water rail </strong>and <strong>snipe</strong> were again very difficult to see, with most records of the former being heard-only, and a peak count of only three of the latter being seen.</p>
<p>Some warm weather at the end of the month meant some birds were singing, with <strong>song thrushes</strong> being heard most days for the last week of the month. A <strong>mistle thrush</strong> was seen on the 23<sup>rd</sup>, the first for a good few months.</p>
<p>The total number of bird species seen here in November 2021 was 63, higher than average for the last five years and only one behind the best total of 64 in November 2016.</p>
