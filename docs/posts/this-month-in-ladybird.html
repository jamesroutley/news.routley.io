    <h1>This Month in Ladybird</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <section>  </section> <section> <div>  <p>Hello friends! July is done. We merged 319 pull requests from 47 contributors.</p>

<p>Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we’re excited to welcome the following new sponsors:</p>
<ul> 
<li> <a href="https://scrapingfish.com">Scraping Fish</a> with $5,000 </li>
<li> <a href="https://t.co/McauGhPdxH">Blacksmith</a> with high-performance CI infrastructure </li>
 </ul>
<p>We’re incredibly grateful for their support. If you’re interested in sponsoring the project, please <a href="mailto:contact@ladybird.org">contact us</a>.</p>
<h3 id="web-platform-tests-wpt"> Web Platform Tests (WPT) </h3>
<p>As usual, we’ve made some progress on the Web Platform Tests. We’ve added 13,090 passing tests for a new total of 1,831,856.</p>
<h3 id="google-recaptcha-passing"> Google reCAPTCHA passing </h3>
<p>There was a long-standing issue with our <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage">postMessage</a> implementation: if the serialized type had not previously been used in the destination realm, we would fail to reconstruct it. The realm didn’t recognize the type and rejected the message.</p>
<p>This is now fixed, allowing Google reCAPTCHA to pass!</p>
<video controls=""><source src="/assets/img/newsletter-july-2025-google-recaptcha.mp4"/></video>
<p>Unfortunately, this only works on <code>https://www.google.com/</code> for now, due to a separate unresolved same-origin policy issue.</p>
<h3 id="high-refresh-rate-support"> High refresh rate support </h3>
<p>We now detect the refresh rate of the active screen to determine how often web content should be rendered. Previously, rendering was fixed at 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>Websites using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame">requestAnimationFrame</a> now render at up to 120Hz on supported hardware. This change also improves the smoothness of scrolling, animations, transitions, and more.</p>

<h3 id="http3-support"> HTTP/3 support </h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3">HTTP/3</a> support was recently added in curl 8.14.0 for users of OpenSSL and <a href="https://github.com/ngtcp2/ngtcp2">ngtcp2</a>. Since Ladybird uses the OpenSSL backend with libcurl, this enabled us to support HTTP/3 as well.</p>
<p>We now negotiate HTTP/3 for servers that advertise it via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Alt-Svc">Alt-Svc header</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-july-2025-http-3.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>We also found and reported an issue in curl where <code>Alt-Svc: clear</code> was parsed incorrectly. This has since been <a href="https://curl.se/ch/8.15.0.html">fixed in curl 8.15.0.</a></p>
<h3 id="trusted-types"> Trusted Types </h3>
<p>Trusted Types is a security feature that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) by locking down injection sinks like <code>Element.innerHTML</code>, <code>HTMLScriptElement.text</code>, and <code>HTMLScriptElement.src</code>. It allows web developers to define policies that control how sanitized content can be created and consumed.</p>
<p>This month, we added initial support for Trusted Types. This includes recognizing policies and enforcing type-safe DOM writes. Further work is ongoing to support more of the spec and improve compliance.</p>
<h3 id="svg-foreignobject-improvements"> SVG <code>foreignObject</code> improvements </h3>
<p>The relationship between HTML and SVG is complex. While SVG content can appear in HTML, SVG can also embed arbitrary HTML using the <code>foreignObject</code> element.</p>
<p>This month, we made major improvements to how Ladybird handles <code>foreignObject</code>. Layout, style resolution, and rendering inside embedded HTML are now much closer to spec behavior, with better integration between the two worlds.</p>
<h3 id="css-content-url"> CSS <code>content: url(...)</code> </h3>
<p>We added support for using <code>content: url(...)</code> in CSS pseudo-elements such as <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code>. This allows authors to insert images via CSS content, matching behavior seen on modern websites.</p>
<h3 id="statefoo-and-unchecked-pseudo-classes"> <code>:state(foo)</code> and <code>:unchecked</code> pseudo-classes </h3>
<p>We gained two new pseudo-classes:</p>
<ul> 
<li> <code>:state(foo)</code> matches a custom element whose states set includes <code>&#34;foo&#34;</code>. This allows custom elements to be styled based on internal state, similar to how <code>:checked</code> and <code>:empty</code> work. </li>
<li> <code>:unchecked</code> matches elements that are checkable but currently not checked. </li>
 </ul>
<p>These additions improve our compatibility with web components and modern form styling.</p>
<h3 id="logical-property-groups"> Logical property groups </h3>
<p>Building on work from <a href="https://ladybird.org/newsletter/2025-06-30/#css-logical-aliases">last month</a>, we now generate the mappings from logical to physical properties at compile time.</p>
<p>Logical and physical properties form groups—for example, the various <code>margin</code> properties—and we now take these into account when serializing styles and when modifying them from JavaScript. This improves both CSS fidelity and performance.</p>
<h3 id="arbitrary-substitution-functions"> Arbitrary substitution functions </h3>
<p>This month we rewrote our implementations of <code>var()</code> and <code>attr()</code> to align with the formal definition of <em> arbitrary substitution functions </em> in recent CSS specs. These are functions that return a value to be substituted into the rule before parsing continues.</p>
<p>Our new implementation is more robust, more spec-compliant, and sets us up to support other substitution functions like <code>if()</code> and <code>env()</code> in the future.</p>
<h3 id="syntax-parsing"> <code>&lt;syntax&gt;</code> parsing </h3>
<p>CSS now allows authors to define the expected syntax for attribute values using the <code>&lt;syntax&gt;</code> type. This is used within <code>attr()</code> to guide how the value should be parsed.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="css"><code><span><span>color: attr(</span><span>data-color</span><span> type(&lt;color</span><span>&gt;</span><span>));</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This instructs the parser to interpret the <code>data-color</code> attribute as a CSS color. Ladybird now supports <code>&lt;syntax&gt;</code> parsing and uses it to improve behavior in CSS Houdini and custom properties.</p>
<h3 id="property-progress"> <code>@property</code> progress </h3>
<p>We’ve had a stub implementation of <code>@property</code> for a while. This month, we started fleshing it out.</p>
<p>We now respect the initial value defined in a <code>@property</code> declaration and added initial support for <code>CSS.registerProperty()</code>. This brings us closer to full Houdini support.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-is-utf-16"> The Web is UTF-16 </h3>
<p>By definition, strings in JavaScript and the web are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#utf-16_characters_unicode_code_points_and_grapheme_clusters">UTF-16 encoded</a>. Until now, LibJS used UTF-8 internally and transcoded to UTF-16 on the fly.</p>
<p>This month, we introduced a native UTF-16 string type and began transitioning LibJS and LibWeb to use it internally. This simplifies the implementation and avoids subtle encoding-related bugs, especially with Unicode edge cases.</p>
