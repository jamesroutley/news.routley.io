<p data-block-key="3ke0t"><a href="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/site/security/dependency-graph-list.png?v=2?width=1166">GitHub&#39;s graphic</a> lists a few GitHub repositories associated with &#34;dependencies defined in <b>pypi/requirements.txt</b>&#34; for a sample project. It especially caught my eye because it starts with a repo for <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">the popular Beautiful Soup screen-scraping library</a>. My spouse <a href="https://crummy.com">Leonard Richardson</a> created and maintains Beautiful Soup.</p><p data-block-key="7ev8b">But <i>the repo in the graphic is wrong</i>. It isn&#39;t Leonard&#39;s. Because Leonard doesn&#39;t develop Beautiful Soup on GitHub. (He <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/beautifulsoup">uses the Launchpad forge</a>.)</p><p data-block-key="5b7lf">Python-specific details you can skip:</p><blockquote data-block-key="e10sj">Now, a <code>requirements.txt</code> <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/requirements-file-format/#requirements-file-format">file</a> that (we infer) is reading from the public Python Package Index (PyPI) is going to list the <i>PyPI project names</i> of those packages. <a href="https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/master/frameworks/Python/starlite/requirements.txt">Here is an example <code>requirements.txt</code> file</a>:</blockquote><blockquote data-block-key="as5u2"><code>asyncpg&gt;=0.26.0</code></blockquote><p data-block-key="6fg2l">Yet GitHub&#39;s marketing material is implying that, for each PyPI-hosted dependency in that file, it&#39;ll tell you <b>which GitHub repository</b> is where that project is maintained.</p><p data-block-key="a2ub2">And most of the dependencies in that graphic <i>are</i> the official project repositories, such as <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/">Ned&#39;s Coverage.py</a>. But not Beautiful Soup! No, &#34;Beautiful Soup&#34; shows up as &#34;<a href="https://github.com/adevore/old-beautiful-soup">adevore/old-beautiful-soup</a>&#34; which is Aaron DeVore&#39;s unofficial fork of Beautiful Soup from 2009. As far as I can tell, he did <i>not</i> package it up and upload to PyPI, so there&#39;s no direct link between <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">the official Beautiful Soup package on PyPI</a>, or <i>any</i> Beautiful Soup-related package on PyPI, and Aaron&#39;s GitHub repository. So there&#39;s <i>no</i> PyPI project you could list in <code>pypi/requirements.txt</code> that would get you Aaron&#39;s fork! How did they make that leap?! And why?</p><p data-block-key="408at">If you&#39;re looking to manage the security of your dependencies by relying on GitHub, and one of your dependencies is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">the official Beautiful Soup package on PyPI</a>, then GitHub translating that into &#34;oh you must mean Aaron&#39;s not-on-PyPI fork that was last updated 13 years ago!&#34; is ... not going to be helpful to you.</p><h2 data-block-key="2doqt">Funding</h2><p data-block-key="17ve9">Last week, <a href="https://www.stackaid.us/">StackAid</a> crossed my radar. StackAid, which is <a href="https://www.stackaid.us/blog/stackaid-in-beta/">now in beta</a>, looks to be a bit like <a href="https://tidelift.com/">Tidelift</a> -- a &#34;pay the maintainers for software you use&#34; platform -- but with differences in pricing, the subscriber market, and what subscribers get in return. StackAid is <i>only</i> a mechanism for donation, unlike Tidelift which then provides subscribers with a bunch of benefits such as <a href="https://support.tidelift.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406286733588-About-our-partnership-with-maintainers">commercial-grade maintenance guarantees regarding security and licensing</a>, <a href="https://tidelift.com/subscription/support">customer support from Tidelift with a Service Level Agreement</a>, etc. (Disclaimer: I do some consulting for Tidelift.) Tidelift is more enterprise-focused, with <a href="https://tidelift.com/subscription/pricing">starter pricing at USD $30,000 per year</a> for teams of up to 50 developers, and <a href="https://tidelift.com/solutions/schedule-demo">has &#34;Schedule a Demo&#34; as the first step for potential subscribers</a>. StackAid is probably an easier way for individuals and 5-person companies to support projects they depend on, and has lower minimum pricing and what looks like a more self-managed signup flow. (Right now StackAid is limited to the NPM ecology but <a href="https://www.stackaid.us/blog/stackaid-in-beta">they&#39;re working on expanding beyond that</a>.)</p><p data-block-key="824l3">I mentioned StackAid to Leonard. He took a look and realized that currently he would not be able to claim money through StackAid because it assumes fundable projects are on GitHub: &#34;Owners of open source projects can claim their repositories by installing the StackAid GitHub app.&#34; Beautiful Soup <i>can</i> <a href="https://support.tidelift.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406294816916-How-we-pay-lifters#how-we-pay-lifters-0-0">receive income from Tidelift</a> because Tidelift is working from package dependencies/identities from <a href="https://tidelift.com/lifter/packages-with-income">package managers/repositories such as PyPI, RubyGems, Maven, etc.</a> rather than just GitHub.</p><p data-block-key="td0g">But! StackAid <a href="https://www.stackaid.us/blog/stackaid-in-beta">says it&#39;s working on GitLab access for supporters</a>; certainly expanding beyond GitHub will help and I&#39;m glad they&#39;re aware of the issue, and I figure there&#39;s a possibility they&#39;ll expand to integrate with Launchpad, or offer some alternate attestation mechanism, so Beautiful Soup and projects like it can claim income. And I understand that, when you&#39;re launching the first, beta iteration of an NPM-focused platform, you gotta offer that common-use-case flow first, and GitHub is that.</p><h2 data-block-key="7gnpa">Research and infrastructure support</h2><p data-block-key="57oa">The place I saw this GitHub-only perspective that really gave me pause was in <a href="https://press.stripe.com/#working-in-public"><i>Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</i></a> by Nadia Eghbal, 0578675862, published by Stripe Press, 2020. (I still have a longer review of <i>Working in Public</i> brewing.) In her analysis, Eghbal chooses to ignore all projects that don&#39;t use GitHub (p. 21).</p><p data-block-key="funsd">I picked up <i>Working in Public</i> because I care about open source as infrastructure and how we sustain it. But if you exclude development work on forges and platforms other than GitHub, then you are excluding quite a lot of active, widely-used open source projects, such as -- you know, at this point,

analysis doesn&#39;t cover any of these, then you aren&#39;t going to be able to speak to the sustainability concerns they have, which are likely structurally and qualitatively different from those of the median project on GitHub. Of course some of the difference is in age; legacy and infrastructure projects (often with long-lived codebases) likely have different onboarding, testing, copyright/licensing, and funding difficulties than do newer ones. For further differences, check out <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15611">&#34;The penumbra of open source: projects outside of centralized platforms are longer maintained, more academic and more collaborative&#34; by Milo Z. Trujillo, Laurent Hébert-Dufresne, and James P. Bagrow</a>: <i>EPJ Data Sci.</i> <b>11</b>, 31 (2022), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00345-7">https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00345-7</a> :</p><blockquote data-block-key="7e54r">.... In many ways, however, GitHub is a convenience sample. We need to assess its representativeness, particularly how GitHub&#39;s design may alter the working patterns of its users. Here we develop a novel, extensive sample of public open source project repositories outside of centralized platforms like GitHub. We characterized these projects along a number of dimensions, and compare to a time-matched sample of corresponding GitHub projects. Compared to GitHub, these projects tend to have <b>more collaborators, are maintained for longer periods, and tend to be more focused on academic and scientific problems</b>.....</blockquote><blockquote data-block-key="eht23">We find that the Penumbra emphasizes academic languages (TeX) and older languages (C, C++, PHP, Python), while GitHub represents more web development (JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby), and mobile app development (Swift, Kotlin, Java)....</blockquote><blockquote data-block-key="71lcc">Importantly, projects in the Penumbra also appear to be more heterogeneous in important ways. Namely, we find more skewed distributions of files per repository and average number of editors per file, as well as more bursty patterns of editing. These bursty patterns are characterized by a skewed distribution of interevent time; meaning, projects in the Penumbra are more likely to feature long periods without edits before periods of rapid editing....</blockquote><p data-block-key="8m9jp">The picture of open source dynamics being drawn here is significantly different from the picture Eghbal draws (maintainers are celebrities who are &#34;known for who they are, rather than which projects they&#39;re involved in&#34; (pp. 36-37)). If you want to understand -- and fund -- open source infrastructure and the maintainers who keep it going, a GitHub-only analysis will be significantly misleading.</p><h2 data-block-key="2egmg">How to reach beyond GitHub</h2><p data-block-key="bsarp">I acknowledge the same thing that the authors of &#34;The penumbra of open source&#34; do: it&#39;s super attractive to grab the analysis-ready data GitHub provides. &#34;The Penumbra hosts explored here are fundamentally harder to sample and analyze.&#34; But we do have some tools and resources to reach into the richer and more heterogeneous world.</p><p data-block-key="3t59p">The &#34;penumbra&#34; researchers in their paper suggest some alternative methods, and mention <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/">Software Heritage</a> as well. Check out <a href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/">the Software Heritage archive</a> to browse a lot of open source software that isn&#39;t hosted on GitHub. <a href="https://chaoss.community/software/">The Community Health Analytics Open Source Software (CHAOSS) folks also offer software</a> to help you fetch and analyze history and collaboration artifacts from several tools and platforms; <a href="https://chaoss.community/software/#fws_627bd742414fa">GrimoireLab helps gather information from lots of sources</a> instead of just the GitHub API.</p><p data-block-key="7fra">And even when you&#39;re just following the news, when you come across some new headline or initiative or statistic about open source, it&#39;s worth checking: do they only mean &#34;on GitHub&#34;? Kind of like when I see a headline about &#34;everybody&#34; and they mean &#34;in the US&#34;. Some critical thinking will help you correct for the skew introduced by this all-too-common assumption.</p>

                        <p>Some &#34;AND ANOTHER THING&#34; thoughts:</p>

<p>Even if a project is on GitHub, <a href="https://harihareswara.net/posts/2022/contribution-metrics-are-messy-an-example/" rel="nofollow">&#34;how many contributors does this open source project have?&#34; or &#34;how much contribution is this project getting?&#34; are not simple questions that you can always answer using the GitHub API</a>, partly because <a href="https://whodoesthe.dev/publications/" rel="nofollow">as ACROSS has observed, the built-in GitHub stats aren&#39;t as great at capturing &#34;contributions like outreach, finance, infrastructure, and community management... [and] work like idea generation or bug finding&#34;</a>, and partly because <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobian/status/1572316649197572096" rel="nofollow">&#34;even for projects that DO use GitHub, you still miss lots of context if you ONLY follow there. Eg Django and Python both have the most meaningful design decision discussions elsewhere (forums, mailing lists) even with the source code on GitHub.&#34; (-Jacob Kaplan-Moss)</a></p>

<p>Also check out <a href="https://harihareswara.net/posts/2016/what-should-we-stop-doing-floss-community-metrics-meeting-keynote/" rel="nofollow">a talk I gave on pitfalls in open source metrics in 2016</a>.</p>

<p>Conversation sparked by this post <a href="https://social.coop/web/statuses/109031882881586017" rel="nofollow">in the Fediverse</a> has included some discussion of discoverability, which is a factor that frequently comes up when we discuss decentralization on the web. I don&#39;t frequently use <a href="https://www.openhub.net/" rel="nofollow">OpenHub</a> but that could be another index to use. I&#39;d welcome pointers to indices other than Software Heritage and OpenHub that provide discoverability of open source projects across heterogeneous platforms.</p>

<p>This reminds me of another audience that might only think to check GitHub: new contributors who are looking for their first opportunities in open source. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txLmQ9BVag4" rel="nofollow">At Open Source Bridge 2013, Fiona Tay presented &#34;My First Year of Pull Requests&#34; to share her perspective as a new contributor</a>; I remember that the more seasoned FLOSS participants in the room found it striking that THE way she had looked for projects to join was to search GitHub. But my focus in this post is on people and institutions with more power, resources, and savvy, who are setting up platforms or promulgating conclusions that will affect many.</p>
