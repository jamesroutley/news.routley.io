I&#39;ve been doing some reading and thinking about Transhumanism and Christianity, and I&#39;m curious what other people think. I can see arguments on both sides of the question.</p><p>On the one hand, Transhumanism seems to challenge many Christian teachings and beliefs. If we can cure death and greatly expand our mental and physical abilities, then some of the core Christian ideas about sin, mortality, and salvation might become irrelevant. For example, if there&#39;s no more death, then what&#39;s the point of being resurrected?</p><p>On the other hand, Transhumanism might be seen as a way for humans to participate in God&#39;s plan for creation. If we can take control of our own evolution, then we can become better partners in God&#39;s work. And if we use our new abilities to help others, then we might be living out Jesus&#39; teachings to &#34;love thy neighbor.&#34;</p><p>So what do you think? Is there any way to reconcile these two ideas, or are they fundamentally incompatible?</p><p>Poh92: i mean, most modern christians just disregard 99% of the bible. there&#39;s no reason you couldn&#39;t do this as well.</p><p>OP: That&#39;s a fair point. I think there&#39;s a pretty wide range of beliefs and practices among Christians, and people seem to pick and choose which ones they follow.</p><p>Poh92: this was my point, yes.</p><p>OP: I see. Thanks for clarifying.</p><p>Poh92: yw</p><p>Nightmimists: Sorry. I was thinking &#34;YW&#34; = You&#39;re Welcome?</p><p>Poh92: no, it&#39;s &#34;yes, why&#34;</p><p>Nightmimists: Thanks!</p><p>Poh92: yw</p><p>Nightmimists: YW = Yes, Why? = You&#39;re welcome?</p><p>Poh92: nah, it&#39;s &#34;ya wellington&#34;</p><p>Nightmimists: Sorry, gotcha.
