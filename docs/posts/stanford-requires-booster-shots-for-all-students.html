<p>Students are strongly encouraged to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine booster, if eligible, prior to returning to campus for the winter quarter. And, all eligible students <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/report/2021/12/16/first-two-weeks-winter-classes/">will be required to provide documentation of a booster</a>, unless they have a medical or religious accommodation, by Jan. 31, 2022.</p>

<h3>Where do I submit my booster shot record? </h3>

<p>Upload your vaccination documentation to the <a href="http://vadenpatient.stanford.edu/">Vaden patient portal</a>.</p>

<h3>What if I have a vaccination exemption?</h3>

<p>Boosters are not required for students with Vaden-approved medical or religious exemptions. </p>

<h3>Where can I get a booster shot?</h3>

<p>Boosters for those who are eligible are available through local health care providers and pharmacies. In the United States, <a href="https://www.vaccines.gov/search/?gclid=CjwKCAiAh_GNBhAHEiwAjOh3ZDqtki4YkHMdCMAgNWzXhwslw8byUs3HlV_V4IVYqxuKN4kv-NHGohoC2jAQAvD_BwE">VaccineFinder</a> helps identify providers who offer COVID-19 vaccines. In the Stanford area, boosters are available at Stanford Health Care locations, and in California, boosters can be scheduled through the California Department of Public Health. Information about students’ booster doses can be loaded into the Vaden portal at any time. As a reminder, boosters in California are available for:</p>

<ul><li>Anyone aged 16 or older who has completed their primary vaccination series with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine at least six months ago</li>
	<li>Anyone aged 18 or older who has completed their primary vaccination series with the Moderna vaccine at least six months ago</li>
	<li>Anyone aged 18 or older who has completed their primary vaccination series with the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine at least two months ago</li>
