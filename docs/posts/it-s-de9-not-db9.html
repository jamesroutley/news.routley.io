    <h1>It&#39;s DE9, Not DB9</h1>

  <p>You have been misusing the D-sub connector terminology, and we&#39;re guilty of it, too.</p>

  <p>You’ve seen them everywhere, especially on older computer equipment: the classic 9-pin serial connector. You probably know it as a DB9. It’s an iconic connector for makers, engineers, and anyone who&#39;s ever used an RS232 serial device. Here&#39;s a little secret, though: calling it a DB9 is technically wrong. The correct name is actually DE9.</p>

<p>With the release of our new DE9 Connector Breakouts, we wanted to address a common misconception and explain why we named our boards as we did.</p>

<p><b>In the Interest of Fairness:</b> We are omitting the &#34;-&#34; in &#34;DE-9&#34; and &#34;DB-25.&#34; We have found that using a &#34;-&#34; is optional in writing this information.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>What&#39;s in a Name? The D-Subminiature Standard</h2>

<p>The connector in question belongs to a family known as D-subminiature, or D-sub for short. To put it simply, the &#34;D&#34; in the name comes from the D-shaped metal shield surrounding the pins, which ensures the plug can only be inserted one way!</p>

<p><a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/1/4/2/9/8/DSubminiatures.png"><img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/1/4/2/9/8/DSubminiatures.png" alt="D-sub connector selection"/></a> </p>

<p>The full part number for these connectors follows a specific pattern. The first letter is always D for the D-shape. The second letter, however, is where the confusion starts. It doesn&#39;t stand for a feature; it specifies the size of the connector&#39;s shell. The number that follows indicates the number of pins in that shell.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of the standard D-sub shell sizes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>DA</strong>: 15-pin shell</li>
<li><strong>DB</strong>: 25-pin shell (This is the big one you&#39;d see on old parallel printer ports)</li>
<li><strong>DC</strong>: 37-pin shell</li>
<li><strong>DD</strong>: 50-pin shell</li>
<li><strong>DE</strong>: 9-pin shell (Today&#39;s topic)</li>
</ul>

<p>The correct technical designation for a D-sub connector with nine pins is DE9. Although &#34;DB9&#34; is a widely used term, it is a misnomer based on the D-sub naming convention, where the second letter signifies the shell size. The &#34;E&#34; in DE9 denotes the specific shell size that houses nine pins while the letter &#34;B&#34; refers to a larger shell designed for 25 pins, as seen in a correctly named DB25 connector. To be blunt, the term &#34;DB9&#34; is plainly inaccurate because it pairs the 25-pin &#34;B&#34; shell with a 9-pin count, a physical contradiction. Despite this, &#34;DB9&#34; became the de facto standard name and is commonly understood to refer to the 9-pin serial connector.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>So, Why Do We All Call It DB9?</h2>

<p>The mix-up is a classic case of mistaken identity that just stuck. The original IBM PC used a DB25 connector for its serial and parallel ports. When the smaller 9-pin serial port was introduced on the IBM PC/AT, it quickly became the new standard for serial ports.</p>

<p><a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/1/4/2/9/8/Ibm_pc_5150.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/1/4/2/9/8/Ibm_pc_5150.jpg" alt="IBM PC/AT"/></a> </p>

<p>Most people, already familiar with the term &#34;DB25,&#34; simply swapped the number of pins and started calling the new connector a DB9. The incorrect name spread like wildfire and became the de facto standard term, despite being technically inaccurate. It&#39;s a prime example of typical usage winning out over technical accuracy.</p>

<h2>Our Naming Philosophy: Correctness and Clarity</h2>

<p>With the launch of our new <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-de9-breakout-male.html">SparkFun Male DE9 Breakout</a> and <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-de9-breakout-female.html">SparkFun Female DE9 Breakout</a>, we made a conscious decision to use the technically correct name. This blog post is our explanation for why.</p>

<p>At SparkFun, we are engineers, makers, and educators at heart. We believe in technical accuracy and in sharing our knowledge with the community. While we know that a vast majority of people search for &#34;DB9,&#34; we felt it was essential to stick to the correct DE9 designation for our products.</p>

<p>It’s our small way of doing our part to correct a decades-old mix-up. We want our product names to be accurate and serve as a learning opportunity for anyone curious about the &#34;why.&#34; So when you see the &#34;DE9&#34; on our new breakouts, you&#39;ll know that the name is as intentional as the engineering that went into the board itself.</p>

<p>So, while the world might continue to refer to it as DB9, we&#39;ll call it for what it is: a DE9. Happy hacking!</p>
