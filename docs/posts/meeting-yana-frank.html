I will then delete everything, and write some of what she shared during our conversation on productivity and writing.</p><p><strong>Productivity</strong></p><ol><li><p>Yana at one point did an experiment where she wrote what she had done for the last 15 minutes every 15 minutes. She kept going for around 3 months. She did this to learn what she actually spends time on. Her main conclusion was that some tasks take way longer than she thought, and some much much less (e.g Some bureaucracy tasks we dread take only 45 minutes). </p></li><li><p>She plans her day in advance and her weekly structure is mostly the same. A planned hour is 45 minutes of work and 15m break. It is important to have a structure in our calendar (for example, every day starts the same, and has a 4 hour chunk of work). She usually won’t spend more than 4 hours on a single topic.</p></li><li><p>Although her days are planned, she always leaves 3 hours empty. This is room for rescheduling and for spontaneity. I personally like this approach. </p></li><li><p>Weekends are unplanned and are completely spontaneous. That does not mean she won’t work during weekends, she might if she wants to, but she also might not and spend 5 hours with me and my wife on a Saturday if that is what life brings. </p></li><li><p>She won’t work on more than 3 projects at the same time.</p></li><li><p>An audience is important. It brings energy and feedback to your work, and makes you want to do more.</p></li></ol><p><strong>How Blogging Changed </strong></p><p>Yana mentioned that the algorithmic feed had completely changed her audience in LiveJournal. She had to write posts that makes users engage with comments and ask for likes, which leads to a certain type of posts and certain types of readers. Moderating comments eventually lead to burnout until she decided to stop. She is still creating content, but she is now on Patreon.</p><p>This is aligned with the change I have been experiencing as a twitter user, but it was striking to see the impact algorithmic feeds have on writers. </p><p><strong>On Writing</strong></p><p>One of my favorite stories from our conversation was about how Yana started to write. Whenever someone in her family sent a letter from abroad, the whole family would gather and read. When Yana was on the move, her mother told her to write down stories and imagine the whole family gathering to read what she wrote. And so she began writing, as a child.</p><p>Yana’s writing corpus is inspiring and most notably for me - very different from what I write. Up until now I only published when I thought my content was “good enough”. It had to have a new insight or something that I haven’t read already on the internet. Thing is</p><p> 1) I am not good enough at judging that, and I probably won’t be anytime soon.</p><p> 2) High thresholds for publishing means I write less, because I lose contact with my audience.</p><p>So I am changing what “good enough” means for me. </p><p>My new “good enough” for publishing is anything I will be happy that I wrote down + might help in anyway to one person who reads it. I am definitely happy I wrote this down, and it has some ideas so I think this post qualifies for both.</p><div><div><p>Thanks for reading Elad&#39;s Newsletter!
