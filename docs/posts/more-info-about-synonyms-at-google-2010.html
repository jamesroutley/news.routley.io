		<p>That is really interesting Matt – but one thing I find challenging is that English and US English words are still treated differently and the same at the same time. For example [search engine optimisation] gives  (as used in Ireland, Canada, South Africa, Australia, the UK, New Zealand) shows some 36 million results but with a ‘z’ it shows 1.6billion results. In Ireland, the UK and other “UK” English countries, the suggestion giving is with a ‘z’ – which is technically incorrect in those countries (think of the poor English teachers 🙂 ). Despite the difference in resulting pages, Irish SEO sites with the correct spelling still show even when searching with a ‘z’ but slightly lower than without – surely spelling should be localised (localized) by now?</p><!-- end .comment-content -->

			<p>Hi matt.</p>
<p>Nice juicy stat on the 70% of queries containing synonyms – which of course will be savoured with a pinch of salt, when considered against the language variations.</p>
<p>On a similar note, we seemed to be having an interesting test over here in the UK last week; where many searches resulted in listings that had spelling variants that could be considered ‘Americanised’.  I’m sure that this speaks to the same point about user demand, cultural shifts, slang etc. </p>
<p>Can you see a world where Google can cope with colloquial/regional variants within a country?</p>

			<p>Do you think this technology (and related technology) potentially competes with microformats? If computers can organize and make sense of data without the additional markup then why add it?</p>
<p>Seems microformats just turn into the keyword meta tag at some point – useless markup that doesn’t add value any more. </p>
<p>Granted, stuff like RDF(a) does more than just organize, but it appears the technology mentioned in your post could be extended in a similar way.</p>

		<p>Matt, It is amazing how many articles are worded for seo and have absolutely no benefit to the end user. And somehow they get awesome rankings in the serps. I have noticed lately that some fall off a lot quicker than they did before.

			<p>Within a post, I generally prefer to use a consistent term–flash drive, perhaps.  So this always seemed like a perfect use for keyword metadata:  providing alternative keywords so that people could find the post (using whatever term was natural for them) while keeping the text itself consistent.</p>
<p>What I hear about search engines, though, is that they don’t really support that use of keyword metadata.</p>

		<p>If the algo is good at matching synonyms why would you need to “incorporate different ways of talking about a subject” in your document?  If the algo works as described, shouldn’t a good doc about “thumb drive” be able to rank for “flash drive” or “usb drive” without actually using these terms?</p><!-- end .comment-content -->

			<p>Synonyms generally work pretty well, but they aren’t perfect.</p>
<p>For example, there is a actors’ agent/professional deathmatch wrestler (yeah, I like wrestling, I don’t wanna hear it) named Billy Gram who often gets confused with the preacher Billy Graham.  Now, Billy Gram isn’t exactly in the mainstream, but he does have a certain Cult following and queries for him shouldn’t be considered synonymous with those of Billy Graham the pastor.  </p>
<p>Just a minor pet peeve, though, and this was as good a time as any to give it up.</p>

			<p>Philip Brewer: I completely agree with you. </p>
<p>Mats advice in this case is awful. Think about a persons writing an article – to use the same term to describe something is considered a good style. What he advertises here is the same good old keyword stuffing that is known to work for ages and this my friends, is really, really sad.</p>

		<p>Does it all about of putting synonyms only? I believe the main thing is mentioning relevant terms in your content <em>e.g. If you write anything about “Tiger Woods” you must include the term “Golf” in your content and vice versa.</em> And “Tiger Woods” and “Golf” is not synonyms of each other in any way. Correct me, if I am wrong 🙂</p><!-- end .comment-content -->

		<p>As you said, an usb drive could also be called thumb drive, usb key, pocket drive, usb pocket drive, etc.  we used to specify these kinds of variations in the meta keywords section, but the meta keywords is completely ignored by Google! You can optimize only for a particular keyword or a set of keywords for the page content on a page without sounding spammy… This is why I take this opportunity to ask Google to start indexing meta keywords also rather than ignoring them.</p><!-- end .comment-content -->

			<p>To be honest, I might be one of the few people that hate Google synonyms. I often do searches for very specific topics – like, a command in a programming language, an error message, or a specific excerpt from a book or article.</p>
<p>It happens sometimes in such cases, the synonyms are exactly what I do NOT want, because I really need a search for the EXACT thing I’ve typed in. But the results are so stuffed with synonym results that I can’t find websites that actually have what I’m looking for. It gets even worse when I have to use signs like “.” or “#” in my query. It actually happens that Google turns practically useless in some such cases.</p>
<p>Would be great if there was a chance to actually deactivate synonyms in specific search queries, and get only the results that really match EXACTLY what you were looking for, letter by letter.</p>

		<p>Interesting post.  So are you saying that webmasters still have to utilize the synonyms in their websites to be ranked for these terms?  Or does the algorithm identify synonyms and rank them even if they don’t carry the word in the content?  E.G.  Can my “pictures of kittens” site rank for “photos of cats” if there are no inbound links or content that say photographs or cats?</p><!-- end .comment-content -->

			<p>I too would like to be reassured that Google is taking into account English synonyms not just american ones.  The one that always makes me laugh is cracker – in the UK it is a thin water biscuit but a biscuit in US is what we call a scone despite the word biscuit meaning “cooked twice” which is the traditional method of cooking biscuits but not scones!   Does Google understand all of this?  Plus of course as I do SEO, the s/z in optimisation is a concern too if there is any skewing of UK results towards US results.</p>
<p>Plus how do I get my avatar on here instead of a little chunk of wallpaper?</p>

		<p>I know that this is some time off, and getting computers to understand English is hard, but I really think that there is a time that is not too far off when there will be a more intelligent interpretation of what a webpage is about  – it’s meaning.  Another thought that I wonder if is in the mix.  The web is about information, right?  And in academia we have no problem in citing our sources.  When people are creating backlinks to build their PR they want just one way links.  However, wouldn’t it be better to have it so that we can freely cite our sources, without losing PR along the way.  Better still, to actually benefit by this practice and have a PR boost.  That way we increase the information gathering.  Google can then start to form this information into clusters and index clusters of meaning such that results that are displayed start with the area of each cluster which most relates to the meaning, and then lower down the cited pages as meaning decreases.  Lastly, I think we need to train people better at searching, so if they want to buy something, they need to put ‘buy’.  Def is brilliant as are other little phrases, but we need to get better at it.  Perhaps we need ‘meaning: XXXX’ if we were to follow my suggestion?  Great reading your stuff Matt, thanks again</p><!-- end .comment-content -->

			<p>I realised this along time ago… </p>
<p>that’s why if I’m looking for something a little different in a competitive area I always go to “a less sophisticated” search engine because I find in my experience that no amount of re-phrasing will help, google just keeps on churning out the same results that I don’t want!</p>
<p><i>I think that somehow google should work out that if a searcher has to rephrase then if the same sites and same pages are going to be returned (say on the 1st page) there should be a “eureka” moment and those results dumped (i.e. they’ve had their chance for this searcher) for an alternative set! </i></p>

			<p>Hi Matt, sorry I comment way off topic, but I have a question that may sound interesting for you to answer.</p>
<p>I have site A, bad designed (using tables and infinite w3c errors). I modified the site structure (few content modification) and now it perform on serps way worse than before. </p>
<p>1) What steps will you take into account to make this kind of change so we don’t drastically lost positions in the effort to keep updated to the latest standards.</p>
<p>2) Google is encouraging users to go HTML5 as soon as possible. Is google bot able to understand those tags already? Will I have any benefits of having a     tag(s) or will it be worse/same than , etc  ?</p>
<p>Intro:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, 3 month later (now) it dropped from position #3 to #9 which is currently right now, which points to me that something is not right and we need to keep working on the SEO. Ok, that’s straight forward but I was just wondering…</p>
<p>Greetings and thank you for your time.</p>

			<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>I enjoy your blog and thanks for giving all of us a small peek inside google regarding synonyms and the 70% benchmark. However, it seems google is trying to have us write in blogs or have full sales descriptions loaded with keyword variations. Alot of times it’s neither feasible or sensible. For example if I was to sell usb drives and try to rank for it’s variations, I’d have to write something like this (below) just to work those keywords on one sales page: </p>
<p>Spammy:</p>
<p>“While I was on a drive, a sudden lightning flash sizzled my thumb because I was fiddling with the USB on my key chain. Luckily I could still drive but the flash really hurt my eyes, my thumb still hurts to drive and the USB drive is melted so I stuck it in my pocket… At least I could drive without my thumb and a hot USB in my pocket”</p>
<p>Or somewhat sensible for an infomercial:</p>
<p>“Our big data USB memory drives rock. Pow! In a flash you can slip these 100 gb beauties in, grab the data and leave with it in your pocket. So tiny (smaller than your thumb)… you won’t feel it in your pocket while you drive. Who needs memory? Never forget where your  big data thumb drive is, ours fits right on a key chain for easy storage and access when you drive around town.” Order now!</p>
<p>There has to be a better way than to write the drivel (above) or include a laundry list of bulleted variations to let people know that # gb drive, thumb drive, key drive, usb drive, pocket drive, data drive are interrelated and available on some website. </p>
<p>Maybe I missing something?</p>

		<p>Thanks for shedding more light on Steve’s post. I oversee onsite search for my company’s multiple brands across several languages, and fully understand the complexity involved with managing synonyms (and hypernyms and compound words for that matter). I think it’s especially important to point out what Steve said about not fixing individual “bad synonyms” by hand. You could spend forever trying to fix individual synonyms, but the real value is in testing and modifying the rules that govern results. A lot of people get caught up on this and make their sites less scalable.</p><!-- end .comment-content -->

			<p>Thanks Matt. Useful post. </p>
<p>It makes perfect sense that all searchers will add variance to their search terms – hence the value of including synonyms in copy. I don’t buy the argument that Matt’s post will encourage keyword stuffing / spamming as there are always going to be black hat SEO’ers attempting to ignorantly muscle their way up the SERPS. </p>
<p>The true art of SEO copywriting lies in understanding the diverse needs of your target market and writing copy that not only reads well and triggers the right emotional responses, but is also indexed by search engines for a diverse set of keyphrases.</p>
<p>Google (and MC) have always talked about building sites for humans first; SE’s will follow thereafter. The synonym case is part and parcel of this concept.</p>

		<p>The lesson here is that companies need to focus on their content. They need to think about how their visitors search and not how they refer to their own products and services. One way to really get an accurate understanding of the terms your clients use is to install Google Onsite Search. You can use all the keyword suggestion tools you want, but Google Onsite Search will give you the real data.</p><!-- end .comment-content -->

		<p>No doubt Google has done a good job in handling such queries but written English varies from region to region. I am not very clear how Google is able to analyze such queries.</p><!-- end .comment-content -->

		<p>I am glad my language (spoken by only ~2M people) is among the 100+ supported. It was not always this way. Search used to be quite hard &amp; many similar queries had to be entered manually since there are not only synonyms, even same words can have different suffixes and this was not supported in the past…</p><!-- end .comment-content -->

<p>Now I hate to be too presumptious here, but most of the articles written in my industry, pest control, are crap. Why? Because the guys that really understand professional pest control are not writting most of the content. </p>
<p>For example, scorpions are totally misunderstood by most pest control techs and the public in general.  I just read something online about “scorpion eggs being left in the walls.”  Scorpions don’t lay eggs. Further, the content written for pest control companies by SEO firms continues to regurgitate the falisies that exsist.  Better yet, the professors of local universities that only study lab rats have a gross misunderstanding of pests in the real world.  A university professor quoted by the local newspaper said, “Scorpions do not infest homes.” …Fortunately the general public went to bat for us and the comments on the article vendicate the truth that “Scorpions do and will infest homes.” I know… I am only harping on scorpions here, but the same holds true for other insects, … carpenter ants included. =) </p>
<p>I’m sorry but despite your best efforts to make your home unattractive to carpenter ants, your structure is still made of attractive wood and you are still a good looking guy.</p>
<p>I still like the idea that google is using semantics, it just puts a little damper on my parade as Bulwark is a forward thinking and innovative company that doesn’t agree with the masses.</p>

		<p>I am very interested in this discussion.  I feel like I can relate to exactly the way Google thinks (or the way I think it thinks), and then I find so many different opinions as to how search engines really work.  It shouldn’t be that hard to figure out.  I would like to continue to think that synonyms work well with searches and it’s all common sense. I’ve got my fingers crossed.</p><!-- end .comment-content -->
