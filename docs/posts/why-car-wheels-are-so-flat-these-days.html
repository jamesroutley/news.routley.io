<p>Is a metadata record “almost” expressed in the same language you used for your filter criteria?</p>
<p>If only the machine knew that what you supplied as “depth” in meters, expressed as a
double-precision float, was convertible to the target record’s “d_cm” field, expressed in cm as a
string value (to preserve significant digits).</p>
<p>It may be impractical for a user agent to negotiate a bridging of query and content schema in
real-time, considering the multitude of candidate paths for attribute and entity alignment.</p>
<p>Perhaps, though, certain families of translators can be indexed for opportunistic recognition given
acceptable-compute budgets.</p>
<p>Related to this, certain meandering paths of provenance may be routinely important in selecting
resources for reuse.</p>
<p>Rather than repeated union-finding of indexed intersections along these paths, it may be worth
indexing whole paths or segments thereof.</p>
