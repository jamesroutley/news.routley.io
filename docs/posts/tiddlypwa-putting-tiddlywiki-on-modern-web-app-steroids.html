    <h1>TiddlyPWA: putting TiddlyWiki on modern web app steroids</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Oops, I think I just turned the legendary personal wiki system into an offline-first, installable, encrypted, synchronized Progressive Web App</p><div>
		<p><em>tl;dr: go play with the new thing <a href="https://tiddly.packett.cool/">there</a>, report issues <a href="https://codeberg.org/valpackett/tiddlypwa/issues">there</a> and support me <a href="https://www.patreon.com/valpackett">there</a> :3 but please do read the full story below!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> is quite a famous note-taking system.
Describing itself as “a non-linear personal web notebook”, it’s actually quite a bit more than that.
Thanks to a plugin system, it’s basically an app platform, and plenty of <a href="https://thaddeusjiang.github.io/Projectify/">cool stuff</a> has been made for it.</p>
<p>And it exists as a unique thing: a self-contained web application—a single HTML file with both the app and the content—that you can take around on a USB flash drive.
Oh wait… who even uses those anymore for anything other than OS installers and bringing files to a print shop?</p>
<p>So of course, a bunch of storage solutions have sprung up.
There’s an official node.js based server mode where it becomes more like a traditional web app,
there are browser extensions and even modules inside of TW itself for saving the updated single file to a server,
there are mobile and desktop apps that try to combine that saving with some kind of offline support,
there are people using a file sync solution like Syncthing – I’ve even heard of some people using Syncthing with the server version,
syncing the <code>.tid</code> files between devices and <em>running the server in <a href="https://termux.dev/en/">Termux</a> on their phones</em> to access them on mobile.
Oof. While I’m nerdy enough to <em>be able</em> to do that, I’m also enough of a spoiled basic consumer to know that that’s not the user experience <em>I want</em>.</p>
<p>What I want is something that works like <em>an app</em>. Fully working offline, syncing <em>efficiently</em> (not by POSTing a multi-megabyte HTML file), quickly and reliably when online.
And with client-side encryption, because there’s just <em>no reason</em> to let the server side read the contents here.</p>
<p>There has actually been one good attempt at bringing this kind of sync to TiddlyWiki: <a href="https://noteself.org/">NoteSelf</a>, which integrated <a href="https://pouchdb.com/">PouchDB</a> for storage.
I liked the sound of it, but in practice it wasn’t up to my standards.
It’s a heavyweight modification of TiddlyWiki that doesn’t keep up with latest core updates, PouchDB/CouchDB feel a bit heavy themselves, there’s no encryption, and the offline support is just “run it from your hard drive”.</p>
<p>So… this is where I come in.
Last year, looking to try TiddlyWiki once again, looking through the options and getting frustrated with the aforementioned everything, one thing inspired me.
I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/3420">a basic IndexedDB plugin</a> which made me realize that there is an API for storage backends inside TiddlyWiki.
I realized that there’s no need for core modifications, that I could just start with this and—knowing what I know about the web platform—take it to the next level.
Make a plugin that combines IndexedDB, encryption, a sync engine (with a custom super-lightweight server counterpart for it), and adds a Service Worker and a Web Manifest
to turn TW into a <a href="https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/">Progressive Web App</a> that works offline and installs on mobile with “add to home screen”.
That was a whole Vision. And I knew it had to be done. It just had to exist. So I got to work, putting aside my typical FreeBSD system-level work to get back to good old web dev.</p>
<p>Now, a whole year after that inspiring moment, having gone through huge personal life changes and a reverse putting-aside in favor of my other work again…
it’s finally ready for the public to see.</p>
<p>So.</p>

<p>It’s still rough around the edges, but I’ve put <em>a lot</em> of effort into the setup experience, hiding all the complexity of the flexibility available with how the system is structured
and presenting a very simple “happy path” where if you open the app from a sync server it’s already preconfigured to sync with that server and so on.</p>
<p>I’ve also tried to document it, though I have to say that detailing the security model was a lot easier than trying to explain the whole synchronization/server/content-versus-app thing.
Hopefully at least for those familiar with TiddlyWiki it’s not too hard to understand that there’s the “app wiki” with the core/plugins/themes and the separate encrypted content,
and that the sync server can work with both (differently).</p>
<p>Now, to justify the whole existence of this blog post, let me also list some random fun facts and whatnot – everything that didn’t fit in the documentation itself :)</p>
<h2 id="random-development-tidbits-ha" tabindex="-1"><a href="#random-development-tidbits-ha"><span>Random Development Tidbits (ha)</span></a></h2>
<p>Because of how browsers work, I’ve had to take extra care to make the storage work across multiple running tabs without corrupting anything.
Moreover, I made it all explicitly work together well and it’s kind of a hidden feature now.
Thanks to a combination of BroadcastChannels and Web Locks, you can enjoy a multi-tab experience.
Browse the same wiki simultaneously in two tabs, the navigation will be independent but any changes will be visible everywhere.</p>
<p>This whole <a href="https://codeberg.org/valpackett/argon2ian">argon2ian</a> thing you might’ve seen was indeed created for TiddlyPWA!
I’ve started out using PBKDF2 because it’s available in the Web Crypto API, but eventually decided to upgrade to a modern password hash rather than cranking out iteration counts.
I wasn’t satisfied with the state of existing Argon2 WASM+JS wrappers, so I set out to make my own, code-golfed to the tiniest size possible.
The <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9g8r2ffu4o">yak shaving stack</a> got even deeper during that subproject.
Also, I have used the very new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Compression_Streams_API">Compression Streams API</a> to be able to bundle the Wasm binary as compressed while not having to bunlde a decompressor.
And this has led to the creation of a very funny bug…</p>
<p>…so since that API was already used there I started using it to compress long-enough tiddler contents as well.
Stream APIs are kind of annoying when you don’t want to stream, so I went with the whole “a stream is an async iterator” thing.
When I first gave TiddlyPWA to an external tester I got a report of not being able to save a particular tiddler.
Turns out, that iterator thing is only available in Firefox as of right now.
I accidentally made it so that <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9gv2anuoss"><em>tiddlers longer than 240 bytes would only work in Firefox</em></a>. :D</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9gjs72259o">really funny bug</a> is something I <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1840934">bugzilled here</a> for Firefox Android.
When using <a href="https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard">FlorisBoard</a>, pressing “enter” would result in the password mask (bullet ••• characters) becoming the actual value of the input.
This is something that I have discovered while typing passwords into my TiddlyPWA password prompt!
I also ran into an <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/issues/15244">already reported</a> <code>prompt()</code> bug in Firefox on iOS.</p>
<p>The server was initially written with SQLite as it is now, but when Deno KV was announced I got excited and rewrote it to use KV, hoping to leverage Deno Deploy for an easy server hosting experience.
I quickly ran into a 64KiB limit per entry when trying to do the whole “save the HTML page” thing, but I found <a href="https://github.com/kitsonk/kv-toolbox">kv-toolbox</a>, a module that would do chunking for me.
Then, after everything was ready, already with the aforementioned other person testing it, I discovered (and <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9h1dr9g4jq">ranted about</a>) the undocumented <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/19284">10 mutations in a transaction</a> limitation.
I wasn’t about to give up on atomicity, so I just rewrote everything back to SQLite in a burst of anger and now I hold a bit of a grudge against Deno KV &gt;_&lt;
Even though I recognize that, obviously, it’s just that <em>my use case is absolutely not the intended one</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/68695508">This TypeScript thing</a> that I <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9h1fdi76dt">referenced on fedi</a> was actually for the SQLite part of the TiddlyPWA server.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9hlma651nz">very last minute</a> backwards-incompatible change I suddenly managed to do right before release.</p>
<h2 id="so-tiddlypwa-needs-you" tabindex="-1"><a href="#so-tiddlypwa-needs-you"><span>So, TiddlyPWA Needs YOU!</span></a></h2>
<p>I probably could’ve tried to make it as a commercial product with a centrally hosted server, but that’s not what I made.
TiddlyPWA is fully free (both “as in beer” and “as in freedom”) because I believe in software that empowers everyone to own their data <em>and the software itself</em>, that <s>is never gonna give you up</s> doesn’t die for business reasons.</p>
<p>Right now TiddlyPWA is still early in its development, still missing a lot of things, but hopefully is solid enough to make you check it out.
