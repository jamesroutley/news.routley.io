For the sake of the experiment, the information was fake, so no one&#39;s personal information would be at risk.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Marketplace</em> also took intimate selfie-style photos of two models whose faces were cropped out, and those pictures, along with other generic photos, were saved on the devices.</p><div dir="ltr"><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A combined image of two selfies.

Khan said this would have erased the logging and monitoring software, so <em>Marketplace</em> did not leave devices there and excluded these stores from the test.</p><h2>Photos copied onto USB key</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Marketplace </em>left laptops at the Oakville and Markham locations of electronics and tech repair chain Canada Computers &amp; Electronics, a company with 42 locations across Canada. At both stores, technicians viewed intimate photos.</p><p dir="ltr">At the Markham location, a technician viewed intimate photos as extra large icons, which makes them easier to see without actually opening them, meaning they wouldn&#39;t turn up as recently accessed files.

SK Computers said a technician&#39;s search for all of the photos on the computer would have been a necessary procedure to ensure a thorough examination of the device and to identify potential viruses.</p><p>Khan said there are more effective and less invasive ways to verify data integrity and check for malware or viruses than opening or viewing personal images.</p><p dir="ltr">Dr. Phone Fix said the phone screen was exhibiting &#34;ghost touch&#34; — i.e. that it changed without any direction from the user — and that it&#39;s possible the photos were inadvertently accessed without any action from the technician. However, the tech team behind <em>Marketplace&#39;s </em>test confirmed the phone did not have a ghost touch issue.</p><p><em>Marketplace </em>dropped off devices at seven stores where technicians did not snoop: Mobile Klinik in Mississauga; Future Gadgets in Mississauga; PC Shop Computers in Kitchener; PhoneJI in Mississauga; Apple Service Depot in Markham; KW Cellular in Guelph; and Nerds 4 Hire in Markham.</p><p>Cavoukian called on the federal privacy commissioner to investigate <em>Marketplace</em>&#39;s findings. </p><p dir="ltr">Canada&#39;s privacy commissioner, Phillipe Dufresne, declined a request for an interview.
