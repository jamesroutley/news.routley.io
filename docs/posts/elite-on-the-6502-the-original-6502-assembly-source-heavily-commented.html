						<h2>Fully documented source code for Elite on the BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Commodore 64, Apple II and NES</h2>

						<p><img src="https://elite.bbcelite.com/images/general/Elite-BBCMicro.png" alt="BBC Micro Elite screenshot"/><img src="https://elite.bbcelite.com/images/general/Elite-BBCMicro.png" alt="BBC Micro Elite screenshot"/><img src="https://elite.bbcelite.com/images/general/Elite-Tube.png" alt="BBC Micro 6502 Second Processor Elite screenshot"/></p><p>This site contains the original 1980s source code for the classic space game Elite, with every single line documented and (for the most part) explained. It is literally the original 6502 assembly source code, just heavily commented.</p>

						<p>As well as <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/cassette/articles/map_of_the_source_code.html">exploring the source</a>, you can read <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/deep_dives/">over 120 deep dives</a> into how Elite weaves its magic, <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/playing_elite/">play the game</a>, or take things to a new level with the <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/hacks/">Elite hacks</a>. There are more suggestions for your visit in the section below.</p>

						<p>All the official versions of 6502 Elite are covered (and more):</p>

						<ul>
						    <li>The original <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/cassette/">BBC Micro cassette</a> version</li>

						    <li>The enhanced <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/disc/">BBC Micro disc</a> version</li>

						    <li>The cut-down <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/electron/">Acorn Electron</a> version</li>

						    <li>The super-fast <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/6502sp/">6502 Second Processor</a> version</li>

						    <li>The musical <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/c64/">Commodore 64</a> version</li>

						    <li>The flicker-free <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/apple/">Apple II</a> version</li>

						    <li>The super-smooth <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/master/">BBC Master</a> version</li>

						    <li>The &#34;impossible&#34; <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/nes/">Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</a> version</li>

						    <li>And Angus Duggan&#39;s <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/elite-a/">Elite-A</a>, the epic extended version of the original game</li>

						</ul>

						<p>Elite was first released in 1984, for the BBC Micro. It was written by Ian Bell and David Braben, and was published by Acornsoft (for Acorn machines), Firebird (Commodore 64 and Apple II) and Imagineer (for the NES). The original sources were released some time ago by Ian Bell on his <a href="http://www.elitehomepage.org/">personal website</a>.</p>

						<p><img src="https://elite.bbcelite.com/images/general/Elite-NES.png" alt="NES Elite screenshot"/></p><p>Note that the source code has not been released for the BBC Micro disc, Acorn Electron or BBC Master versions, so where they differ from the released sources, the extra code has been reconstructed by hand from a disassembly of the original game binaries. The rest is all original 1980s source code.</p>

						<p>My hope is that this site will be useful for those who want to learn more about Elite and what makes it tick. It is provided on an educational and non-profit basis, with the aim of helping people appreciate one of the most iconic games of the 8-bit era.</p>
