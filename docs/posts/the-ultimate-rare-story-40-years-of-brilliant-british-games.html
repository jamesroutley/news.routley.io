    <h1>The Ultimate-Rare story: 40 years of brilliant British games</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p><span><span>F</span></span>or five long years, the ZX Spectrum magazine Crash tried to get an interview with the people behind Ultimate Play the Game, which had become one of the UK’s premier games developers. They heard nothing until, one day early in 1988, Crash got a phone call. It was them. And they wanted to talk.</p><p>Ultimate Play the Game, a trading name of Ashby Computers and Graphics, began in 1982, owned by one family: the Stampers – brothers Chris and Tim, and Tim’s future wife Carole Ward, alongside programmer John Lathbury. Even at this stage, the Stampers were supremely confident in their own abilities, honed during the development of several arcade games. “We chose [this] company’s name because we felt it was representative of our products: the ultimate games,” Tim Stamper declared in an August issue of Home Computing Weekly. The brothers designed and created games while Carole juggled administrative roles and contributed art to several of its first hits. Those early titles included <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2007/apr/02/1983iwas10f" data-link-name="in body link">Jetpac</a>, the home computer game that thrust the company into the big time, and turns 40 years old this year.</p><p>Initially, Ultimate focused on the UK’s predominant home computer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/30/zx-spectrum-1980s-home-computer-gamers" data-link-name="in body link">the ZX Spectrum</a>, despite reservations about its technical constraints. “When the Spectrum came out, we thought ‘what a piece of garbage,’” proclaimed Tim Stamper in his <a href="https://www.crashonline.org.uk/51/ultimate.htm" data-link-name="in body link">1988 interview</a> for Crash. But the Sinclair computer grew on the brothers and its ubiquity (at least in the UK) led them to appreciate the commercial opportunities. Having begun their games-development careers creating arcade games in a minimal UK market, the brothers turned their talents towards <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/sep/17/clive-sinclair-zx-spectrum-offbeat-brilliance" data-link-name="in body link">this home computer</a>.</p><figure id="b56b1cee-e53a-4707-9946-2ed01ccf08af" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b98250a17536c3686c31e67a5e901528c0ed140/0_0_2827_1938/master/2827.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b98250a17536c3686c31e67a5e901528c0ed140/0_0_2827_1938/master/2827.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b98250a17536c3686c31e67a5e901528c0ed140/0_0_2827_1938/master/2827.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b98250a17536c3686c31e67a5e901528c0ed140/0_0_2827_1938/master/2827.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b98250a17536c3686c31e67a5e901528c0ed140/0_0_2827_1938/master/2827.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b98250a17536c3686c31e67a5e901528c0ed140/0_0_2827_1938/master/2827.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Jetpac, one of Ultimate’s earliest Spectrum hits" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b98250a17536c3686c31e67a5e901528c0ed140/0_0_2827_1938/master/2827.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="305.06190307746726" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Jetpac, one of Ultimate’s earliest Spectrum hits</span> Photograph: ArcadeImages/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>For some of Ultimate’s longest-standing fans, their first game remains their best. Coded in under 16K, Jetpac was by necessity an uncomplicated game, but it perfectly replicated arcade-style thrills at home. Its hero – Jetman, who would become an unofficial Ultimate mascot – scoots from platform to platform, picking up pieces of his rocket before fuelling it up and heading upwards to the next alien-infested rock. “What puts it to No 1 in this review is the fantastic quality of the graphics,” noted ZX Computing magazine at the time. “But the thing that really caught my eye was the incredible smoothness of it all.”</p><p>Buoyed by the astonishing success of Jetpac, the Stampers created several more impressive hits for the Spectrum. Pssst, Cookie and the driving game Tranz Am all appeared in the summer of 1983, before Ultimate left the 16K Spectrum behind, moving to the heady heights of the 48K model. Lunar Jetman was released in the autumn of 1983 to massive praise throughout the dedicated Spectrum press. “Well, what can you say? Marvellous seems inadequate,” gushed one Crash reviewer.</p><p>Lunar Jetman was another smash, and the Stampers quickly followed it up with the brilliant adventure game Atic Atac. At the same time, with incredible foresight, the brothers were already investigating a new console emerging from Japan, “the Nintendo”. Ultimate’s contacts in the Japanese arcade industry had led them to this new, dedicated games machine. “It had colossal potential,” said Tim in <a href="https://www.crashonline.org.uk/51/ultimate.htm" data-link-name="in body link">the Crash interview</a>. “We looked at this, and we looked at the Spectrum – and the Spectrum was hot stuff – but this was incredible.”</p><p>Tim and Chris spent several months learning all about what would soon become the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/18/40-years-of-the-nintendo-famicom-the-console-that-changed-the-games-industry" data-link-name="in body link">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (NES), while simultaneously working on a game that would redefine the ZX Spectrum and create a new genre. With six high quality games under its belt in less than a year, Ultimate had established itself as one of the UK’s finest games publishers. Incredibly, it was about to get even better.</p><figure id="b10e8f55-7907-4fef-9ac1-ec3d7c523fa3" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.VideoYoutubeBlockElement"><div data-component="youtube-embed"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7n7qtErhF-A?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed" title="Knight Lore Walkthrough, ZX Spectrum" height="480" width="640" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></figure><p>In 1984 Ultimate released Sabre Wulf, the first adventure for a new hero, Sabreman – quickly followed by his second. Then there was Knight Lore. Presented in trademarked “Filmation”, the isometric graphics – a thing of cartoon beauty on such limited technology – predictably wowed reviewers, gamers and programmers alike. “I was handing over Match Day to Ocean when [Ocean boss] David Ward said I needed to look at this game they were distributing,” says Jon Ritman, the coder behind Spectrum isometric classics Batman and Head Over Heels. “I loaded it up and was just blown away. It was like a Disney film you could play … I didn’t even understand how they made the graphics overlay each other … cleanly as well, not in straight lines, but diagonals. It was just <em>great</em>.”</p><p>Like many of his peers, Ritman soon worked out and even improved upon the Knight Lore engine, so similar games proliferated, particularly on the Spectrum. The Stampers had an inkling this would happen: Knight Lore, and a considerable portion of its follow-up, Alien 8, were already completed when the company released Sabre Wulf. All these games received glowing reviews, and with its output now retailing at a pocket-money-busting £9.95 (compared to the average of £6-8 at the time), Ultimate was at its peak. So naturally, in 1985, the Stamper brothers decided it was time to bail out of the home computer market. Rival software publisher US Gold purchased the Ultimate brand, and the Stampers reinvented their company as the console-focused Rare.</p><p>It was the biggest switch in UK gaming history: the country’s most critically and commercially successful programmers (at least on the ZX Spectrum – things weren’t quite so rosy for Ultimate on the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC) had suddenly left behind the computer that had made them. Ultimate’s entire home computer catalogue appeared to be merely a calling card for bigger things. “It was sort of an introduction process,” said Chris in 1988. “We had to show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/nintendo" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Nintendo</a> that we had the capability before they could give us the rights to go ahead and produce for their system.” After the video game crash in the US, the Stampers saw that the market was returning, and predicted that the Nintendo Entertainment System would be at the forefront of this revival. “We knew a market was going to boom in Japan and America, and we set up Rare to handle that,” noted Tim in Crash.</p><figure id="10e2bdac-2cfe-4c75-ae86-2b041a804a8a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b986b104d43739df69884fd93c3e9fdc41c32b/0_0_3704_2753/master/3704.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b986b104d43739df69884fd93c3e9fdc41c32b/0_0_3704_2753/master/3704.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b986b104d43739df69884fd93c3e9fdc41c32b/0_0_3704_2753/master/3704.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b986b104d43739df69884fd93c3e9fdc41c32b/0_0_3704_2753/master/3704.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b986b104d43739df69884fd93c3e9fdc41c32b/0_0_3704_2753/master/3704.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b986b104d43739df69884fd93c3e9fdc41c32b/0_0_3704_2753/master/3704.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Donkey Kong Country on the SNES was graphically advanced for its time and hardware" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b986b104d43739df69884fd93c3e9fdc41c32b/0_0_3704_2753/master/3704.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="330.74649028077755" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Donkey Kong Country on the SNES was graphically advanced for its time and hardware</span> Photograph: ArcadeImages/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>By 1988, Rare had released several NES games including the downhill skiing simulation Slalom, and action platform game Wizards &amp; Warriors.

And then the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle-inspired Battletoads became its conduit into Nintendo’s next-generation console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). By now, so confident was Nintendo in its premier western partner it even entrusted the developer with one of its own properties, Donkey Kong. “[<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/23/pushing-buttons-nintendo-shigeru-miyamoto-super-mario-zelda-video-games" data-link-name="in body link">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>] was admirably hands-off, actually,” recalled Rare’s Gregg Mayles in Retro Gamer magazine. “I mean, he handed one of his characters over to us, and we changed the look of it completely.”</p><figure id="3f69d8bf-aec8-4a7a-b784-304c89875b81" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0df0b2f0d50c09417b8f18eaa2c2cb7f0069800/0_161_4842_2905/master/4842.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0df0b2f0d50c09417b8f18eaa2c2cb7f0069800/0_161_4842_2905/master/4842.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0df0b2f0d50c09417b8f18eaa2c2cb7f0069800/0_161_4842_2905/master/4842.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0df0b2f0d50c09417b8f18eaa2c2cb7f0069800/0_161_4842_2905/master/4842.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0df0b2f0d50c09417b8f18eaa2c2cb7f0069800/0_161_4842_2905/master/4842.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0df0b2f0d50c09417b8f18eaa2c2cb7f0069800/0_161_4842_2905/master/4842.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Rare’s GoldenEye 007, one of the best video games of the 90s" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0df0b2f0d50c09417b8f18eaa2c2cb7f0069800/0_161_4842_2905/master/4842.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="266.981619165634" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Rare’s GoldenEye 007, one of the best video games of the 90s</span> Photograph: Maurice Savage/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Arcade beat-’em-up Killer Instinct followed, together with two further Donkey Kong Country games.
