      <p>The police&#39;s use of facial recognition technology is to be significantly expanded in an attempt to catch more offenders, ministers have announced.</p><p>Under the plans, 10 live facial recognition (LFR) vans will be used by seven forces across England to help identify &#34;sex offenders or people wanted for the most serious crimes&#34;, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/politics-latest-starmer-labour-badenoch-small-boats-farage-12593360" target="_blank"><strong>Politics Hub: Follow latest updates and analysis</strong></a></p><p>The tech, which has been trialled in London and south Wales, will be subject to strict rules, the Home Office said, but human rights groups have warned it is &#34;dangerous and discriminatory&#34;.</p><p>Amnesty International UK said the plans should be &#34;immediately scrapped&#34;, with facial recognition proven to be &#34;discriminatory against communities of colour&#34;.</p>
<p>&#34;It has been known to lead to misidentification and the risk of wrongful arrest,&#34; said Alba Kapoor, the charity&#39;s racial justice lead, &#34;and it&#39;s also known to be less accurate in scanning the faces of people of colour.&#34;</p><p>The Home Office said the LFR vans will only be deployed when there is &#34;specific intelligence&#34;, and will be operated by trained officers who will check every match made by the cameras.</p><p>The vehicles will also only be used against bespoke watch lists, compiled for each use under guidelines set by the College of Policing.</p><p>The vans will be operated by police forces in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, Surrey and Sussex (jointly), and Thames Valley and Hampshire (jointly).</p>

<p><strong>&#39;The most serious offenders&#39;</strong></p><p>Ms Cooper has said ministers are focused on making sure &#34;there are proper safeguards in place&#34;.</p><p>As part of the plans, the home secretary has announced she will be launching a consultation on how and when the cameras should be used, and with what safeguards, which the government will use to draw up a new legal framework for the use of the cameras.</p><p>Ms Cooper said the tech had been used in London and South Wales &#34;in a targeted way&#34;, and helped catch &#34;the most serious offenders, including people wanted for violent assaults or for sex offences&#34;.</p><p><a href="http://news.sky.com/story/met-police-release-footage-as-more-than-1-000-arrests-made-using-live-facial-recognition-technology-13391999" target="_blank"><strong>According to the Metropolitan Police</strong></a>, the tech has led to 580 arrests for offences such as rape, domestic crime and knife crime in the space of 12 months.</p><p>The government has pointed to independent testing by the National Physical Laboratory, which it said found the tech was &#34;accurate&#34; and showed &#34;no bias for ethnicity, age, or gender&#34;.</p><p><strong>Read more politics news:</strong></p>     
<p>Liberty has welcomed the government&#39;s decision to create a statutory framework for using facial recognition, but said that should be in place before the tech is rolled out.</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s no reasonable excuse to be putting even more cameras on our streets before the public have had their say and legislation is brought in to protect all of us,&#34; said a statement.</p><p>The civil liberties charity cited how more than 1.6 million people have had their faces scanned in South Wales, mostly on football match days in Cardiff city centre.</p><p>But Lindsey Chiswick, from the National Police Chiefs&#39; Council (NPCC), has said the expansion &#34;is an excellent opportunity for policing&#34;, and will help officers locate suspects &#34;quickly and accurately&#34;.</p>
