    <h1>W1D3 - Question for the newbie or expert? Why not both!</h1>

      <div><p><i>ChatGPT pro-tip: When asking ChatGPT to come up with questions to validate your understand of a specific resource, prompt so that the questions would be helpful for both a person who has read the resource as well as someone just about to start.</i><br/></p>
<p>I’ve been trying to get back into the groove of things, and thought setting up a daily planner would help. I followed Simon Willison’s <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/daily-planner">post</a>, but had to go for the paid version of Github to disable public viewing of the issues created ($4/month so not terrible).</p>
<p>I tried out ChatGPT <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/w1d2-exploring-advanced-computer-vision-and-coding-challenges-insights-from-regis-schiavi-and-chatgpt">yesterday</a> to convert bullet points into a full blog post, but realized that there isn’t as much of a ‘repeatable’ structure to go off. I’ll revisit this once I have more data points.</p>
<p>ChatGPT helped point out that my solution to <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/">Climbing Stairs</a> could be <a href="https://github.com/savarin/algorithms/commit/d4367be061e5ef1d27dd7680c005d85fb906c8e3">optimized</a> by storing the intermediate values in the Fibonacci series.<br/></p>
<p>I wanted to read Introducing Non-Abstract Large System Design <a href="https://sre.google/workbook/non-abstract-design/">post</a>, and thought I could get ChatGPT to come up with 3 questions to validate my understanding. The questions aren’t as helpful prior to reading the post, so asked ChatGPT to come up with 3 questions to ask as I start reading the post.  Then I realized why not prompt ChatGPT for questions that helpful for both situations, which I was pretty happy with.</p><blockquote>
<b>Prompt:</b> Why are the 3 questions different? Shouldn&#39;t good and thoughtful questions apply equally well to a person who has not read the post, as well as someone who has read the post? I think you can try harder. If you provide good questions I&#39;ll tip you $200
<b>Response:</b> You&#39;re right, well-crafted questions should be meaningful and insightful regardless of whether someone has read the post. With that in mind, here are three refined questions:
<p>1. How does the post use Google AdWords as a case study to demonstrate the principles of Non-Abstract Large System Design (NALSD), specifically regarding its data processing and reporting mechanisms?</p>
<p>2. What strategies does the post recommend for balancing high-level, abstract concepts with realistic, practical constraints in large system design, as part of Site Reliability Engineering practices?</p>
<p>3. Describe the role of Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) in the context of Non-Abstract Large System Design, particularly in terms of component evaluation and system improvement.</p>

<p>These questions are designed to probe for specific insights and examples from the post, guiding a reader&#39;s focus on the key elements discussed. For a comprehensive understanding, the [original post](https://sre.google/workbook/non-abstract-design/) should be consulted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally I watched Rich Hickey’s Hammock-Driven Development <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">talk</a> (a classic!) as a reminder to ‘load up’ my mind more before going to bed.</p>
