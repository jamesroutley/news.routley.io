With PEM, patients like Edwards find themselves locked into a state in which the tiniest overexertion can result in a crash which lasts for months and sometimes even years.<!-- --></p><p>David Putrino, a professor in the department of rehabilitation and human performance at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, believes that there are at least 10 different plausible explanations for why people develop PEM, which range from <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3501671/">sleep disruption<!-- --></a> to <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12035-016-0170-2">hormonal impairments<!-- --></a> and <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12967-022-03244-7">inflammation of the lining of blood vessels<!-- --></a>. But at the heart of many of these theories are tubular, energy-creating structures called mitochondria which can be found in every single one of our cells.<!-- --></p><p>When viruses invade our cells, they hijack mitochondria and leach some of the energy which is being generated for our benefit and use it to help them replicate and pump more virus through the body. &#34;Now you have a cell that is working way over capacity to produce energy for both viral replication as well as the general functions it needs to perform,&#34; says Putrino.<!-- --></p><p>According to Putrino, this means that while we&#39;re trying to recover from an infection, the body is also coping with what he calls an &#34;energy debt&#34;, having been generating twice the customary amount of energy during the infection phase. One of the theories for why Sars-CoV-2 and other viruses can lead to PEM is because small amounts of virus <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01601-2">can persist<!-- --></a> in parts of the body. As such, returning to normal activities before the body has recovered from its energy debt can causes a crash, during which time the virus can <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86015">flare up or reactivate dormant viruses<!-- --></a> and <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/12/3113">induce further mitochondrial damage<!-- --></a>.<!-- --></p><p>In other cases, the muscle weakness and physical impairments which many people with severe post-viral fatigue and PEM describe, are thought to be due to the initial infection <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s15010-024-02386-8?trk=public_post_comment-text">inducing a state of autoimmunity<!-- --></a>, changing the behaviour of immune cells and triggering them to attack the very nerve fibres which enable muscles to contract.

However, she says the key question is what is causing the mitochondria to be impaired.<!-- --></p><p>In some cases of post-viral fatigue stemming from Ebola, Zika and influenza viruses, <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10779395/">research has<!-- --></a> suggested that the cause is <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10779395/">direct viral damage<!-- --></a> to mitochondria DNA.
