When the piece went live, Aaron said the app had 20,000 users, many of whom live in Los Angeles, where ICE has been raiding neighborhoods. In addition to letting users pin ICE agent locations on a map, the app also gives them a way to add notes, such as what the agents are wearing or what car they&#39;re driving. Any user within a five mile radius of the sighting will get an alert.</p><p>But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Independent;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9b10ec1f-8e62-4410-8957-c54f7db63bfc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d556e816-ea47-4f16-8970-bd0fc1e5368f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Independent&amp;linkText=suggested&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jby51ay9uZXdzL3dvcmxkL2FtZXJpY2FzL3VzLXBvbGl0aWNzL2ljZWJsb2NrLWFwcC10cmFja2VyLWNubi10cnVtcC1iMjc4MDY4NC5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkNTU2ZTgxNi1lYTQ3LTRmMTYtODk3MC1iZDBmYzFlNTM2OGYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvYW1lcmljYXMvdXMtcG9saXRpY3MvaWNlYmxvY2stYXBwLXRyYWNrZXItY25uLXRydW1wLWIyNzgwNjg0Lmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAa5qGiHdA4KS_JjwPdcDC_fPro3patrcHxPwboNCgaAs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Fus-politics%2Ficeblock-app-tracker-cnn-trump-b2780684.html&amp;source=engadget_article_commerce_ctrl&amp;refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2Fsocial-media%2Ficeblock-climbs-to-the-top-of-the-app-store-charts-after-officials-slam-it-004319963.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:suggested;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Independent;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">suggested</a> that the <em>CNN</em> piece was &#34;an incitement of further violence against...
