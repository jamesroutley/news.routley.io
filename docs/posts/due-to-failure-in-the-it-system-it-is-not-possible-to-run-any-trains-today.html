            <p>Although the cause of the failure has now been resolved, the impact is considerable. To be able to start up reliably, systems must be updated and trains must be brought to the right place. That takes time. For our passengers, this is extremely unpleasant news.</p>

<p>The expectation is that tomorrow morning the normal timetable can largely be resumed. The night trains can still run.</p>

<p>The IT failure occurred at the end of the morning. It affected the system that generates up-to-date schedules for trains and staff. This system is important for safe and scheduled operations: if there is an incident somewhere, the system adjusts itself accordingly. This was not possible due to the failure. </p>

<p>The international trains are not affected by this failure. For information about the timetables of other transporters, passengers can consult the websites of these transporters. </p>

<p>The journey planner is updated.</p></div>
