          In this article, we will build an Autograd engine and a neural network library that handle an N-dimensional array. Autograd is a tool used for derivative calculation. It tracks operations on values with enabled gradients and builds a dynamic computational graph â€” a graph without cycles. Input values serve as the leaves of the graph, while output values act as its roots. Gradients are computed by traversing the graph from root to leaf, applying the chain rule to multiply gradients at each step. </p><h2>What is Derivates?</h2><p>

          Derivatives help us understand how things are changing at a specific point. They are like speedometers that measure
          the rate of change of a quantity or the slope of a curve. By calculating derivatives, we can gain insights into
          motion, growth, and other dynamic processes. </p></div></div>
