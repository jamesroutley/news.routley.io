    <h1>Ask HN: How would you design an alternative Twitter</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>So much talk about Twitter alternatives in recent days, including people migrating to Mastodon and even Jack Dorsey announcing his new decentralized social media platform.</p><p>I was thinking, if I was to build a new micro-blogging aka Twitter alternative, what technological choices would I make to get it quickly off the ground but allow for scale?</p><p>What database technology or approach would you go for?</p><p>Would you build a (mobile first) web application first or would you start straight away with a native iOS/Android app (maybe Flutter)?</p><p>Would you go for a centralised or decentralized approach? If the latter, how would you decentralize it without sacrificing the &#34;public town square&#34; effect that Twitter currently has but is clearly lacking with the fragmentation of Mastodon?</p><p>To answer my own question, I would probably build a centralized platform like Twitter is now, probably opt for a fast NoSQL database like Google&#39;s Firestore in Datastore mode and to keep things simple I would probably even make sure that tweets would get automatically deleted after some years as I don&#39;t think it&#39;s needed to build a forever growing database of people&#39;s thoughts in that moment that persists for decades to come. Micro-blogging always felt to me as a thing right now, a thought in this moment but that thought could be different in a few days, months and definitely a few years, so why store it forever. Feels like I could save a huge operational cost and prevent abuse by not keeping tweets for beyond their relevancy.</p><p>What are your thoughts?</p></div></div></div>
