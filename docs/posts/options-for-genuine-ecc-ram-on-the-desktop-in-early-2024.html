</div><div><p>A traditional irritation with building (or specifying) desktop
computers is <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/UseECCIrritation">the issue of ECC RAM</a>, which for
a long time was either not supported at all or <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/IntelCPUSegmentationIrritation">was being used by
Intel for market segmentation</a>.
First generation AMD Ryzens sort of supported ECC RAM with the right
motherboard, but <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/ECCRAMSupportLevels">there are many meanings of &#39;supporting&#39; ECC RAM</a> and questions lingered about how meaningful
the support was (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/AMDWithECCKernelMessages">recent information suggests the support was real</a>). Here in early 2024 the situation
is somewhat better and I&#39;m going to summarize what I know so far.</p>

<p>The traditional option to getting ECC RAM support (along with a
bunch of other things) was to buy a &#39;workstation&#39; motherboard that
was built to support Intel Xeon processors. These were available
from a modest number of vendors, such as SuperMicro, and were
generally not inexpensive (and then you had to buy the Xeon). If
you wanted a pre-built solution, vendors like Dell would sell you
desktop Xeon-based workstation systems with ECC RAM. You can still
do this today.</p>

<p>Back in 2022, Intel introduced their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_1700#Alder_Lake_chipsets_(600_series)">W680 desktop chipset</a>.
One of the features of this chipset is that it officially supported
ECC RAM with 12th generation and later (so far) Intel CPUs (or at
least apparently the non-F versions), along with official support
for memory overclocking (and CPU overclocking), which enables faster
&#39;XMP&#39; memory profiles than the stock ones (should your ECC RAM
actually support this). There are a modest number of W680 based
motherboards available from (some of) the usual x86 PC desktop
motherboard makers (and SuperMicro), but they are definitely priced
at the high end of things. Intel has not yet announced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_1700#Raptor_Lake_chipsets_(700_series)">a &#39;Raptor
Lake&#39; chipset version of this</a>,
which would presumably be called the &#39;W780&#39;. At this date I suspect
there will be no such chipset.</p>

<p>(The Intel W680 chipset was brought to my attention <a href="https://mastodon.social/@bshanks/111897549472732911">by Brendan
Shanks on the Fediverse</a>.)</p>

<p>As mentioned, AMD support for ECC on early generation Ryzens was a
bit lackluster, although it was sort of there. With the current
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_AM5">Socket AM5</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_4">Zen
4</a>, a lot of mentions of ECC
seem to have (initially) been omitted from documentation, as discussed
in Rain&#39;s <a href="https://sunshowers.io/posts/am5-ryzen-7000-ecc-ram/">ECC RAM on AMD Ryzen 7000 desktop CPUs</a>, and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-confirms-ryzen-8000g-apus-dont-support-ecc-ram-despite-initial-claims">Ryzen
8000G series APUs don&#39;t support ECC at all</a>.
However, at least some AM5 motherboards do support ECC with recent
enough firmware (provided that you have recent BIOS updates and
enable ECC support in the BIOS, per Rain). These days, it appears
that a number of current AM5 motherboards list ECC memory as supported
(although <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/ECCRAMSupportLevels">what supported means is a question</a>)
and it will probably work, especially if you find people who already
have reported success. It seems that even some relatively inexpensive
AM5 motherboards may support ECC.</p>

<p>(Some un-vetted resources are <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/truenas/comments/10lqofy/ecc_support_for_am5_motherboards/">here</a>
and <a href="https://forum.level1techs.com/t/am5-consumer-motherboards-with-full-reporting-and-correcting-ecc/200543">here</a>.)</p>

<p>If you can navigate the challenges of finding a good motherboard,
it looks like an AM5, Ryzen 7000 system will support ECC at a lower
cost than an Intel W680 based system (or an Intel Xeon one). If you
don&#39;t want to try to thread those rapids and can stand Intel CPUs,
a W680 based system will presumably work, and a Xeon based system
would be even easier to purchase as a fully built desktop with ECC.</p>

<p>(Whether ECC makes a meaningful difference that&#39;s worth paying for
is a bit of an open question.)</p>
