    <h1>Nvidia releases its own brand of world models</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Nvidia is getting into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/14/what-are-ai-world-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">world models</a> — AI models that take inspiration from the mental models of the world that humans develop naturally. </p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/storyline/live-updates-ces-2025-nvidia-samsung-sony-toyota-reveals-plus-more/">At CES 2025 in Las Vegas</a>, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/nvidias-ces-2025-keynote-how-to-watch/">company announced</a> that it is making openly available a family of world models that can predict and generate “physics-aware” videos. Nvidia is calling this family Cosmos World Foundation Models, or Cosmos WFMs for short.</p>







<p>The models, which can be fine-tuned for specific applications, are available from Nvidia’s API and NGC catalogs, GitHub, and the AI dev platform Hugging Face.</p>

<p>“Nvidia is making available the first wave of Cosmos WFMs for physics-based simulation and synthetic data generation,” the company wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. “Researchers and developers, regardless of their company size, can freely use the Cosmos models under Nvidia’s permissive open model license that allows commercial usage.”</p>

<p>There are a number of models in the Cosmos WFM family, divided into three categories: Nano for low latency and real-time applications, Super for “highly performant baseline” models, and Ultra for maximum quality and fidelity outputs.</p>

<p>The models range in size from 4 billion to 14 billion parameters, with Nano being the smallest and Ultra being the largest. Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters.</p>

<p>As a part of Cosmos WFM, Nvidia is also releasing an “upsampling model,” a video decoder optimized for augmented reality, and guardrail models to ensure responsible use, as well as fine-tuned models for applications like generating sensor data for autonomous vehicle development. These, as well as the other Cosmos WFM models, were trained on 9,000 trillion tokens from 20 million hours of real-world human interactions, environment, industrial, robotics, and driving data, Nvidia said. (In AI, “tokens” represent bits of raw data — in this case, video footage.)</p>


<p>Nvidia wouldn’t say where this training data came from, but at least one report — and <a href="https://www.law.com/therecorder/2024/08/16/nvidia-slapped-with-class-action-by-youtube-creators-for-using-content-to-train-ai-software/?slreturn=20250106115417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lawsuit</a> — <a href="https://www.404media.co/nvidia-ai-scraping-foundational-model-cosmos-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">alleges</a> that the company trained on copyrighted YouTube videos without permission.</p>

<p>When reached for comment, an Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch that Cosmos “isn’t designed to copy or infringe any protected works.”</p>

<p>“Cosmos learns just like people learn,” the spokesperson said. “To help Cosmos learn, we gathered data from a variety of public and private sources and are confident our use of data is consistent with both the letter and spirit of the law. Facts about how the world works — which are what the Cosmos models learn — are not copyrightable or subject to the control of any individual author or company.”</p>







<p>Setting aside the fact that models like Cosmos <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/04/are-language-models-doomed-to-always-hallucinate/">don’t really learn like people learn</a>, copyright experts say claims like Nvidia’s, which draw support from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fair use legal doctrine</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/16/this-week-in-ai-midjourney-bets-it-can-beat-the-copyright-police/">may not stand up to judicial scrutiny</a>. Whether these companies prevail will largely depend on how courts decide fair use, which allows for the use of copyrighted works to make something new as long as it’s transformative, applies to AI training.</p>

<p>Nvidia claimed that Cosmos WFM models, given text or video frames, can generate “controllable, high-quality” synthetic data to bootstrap the training of models for robotics, driverless cars, and more.</p>

<p>“Nvidia Cosmos’ suite of open models means developers can customize the WFMs with data sets, such as video recordings of autonomous vehicle trips or robots navigating a warehouse,” Nvidia wrote in a press release. “Cosmos WFMs are purpose-built for physical AI research and development, and can generate physics-based videos from a combination of inputs, like text, image and video, as well as robot sensor or motion data.”</p>

<p>Nvidia said that companies, including Waabi, Wayve, Foretellix, and Uber, have already committed to piloting Cosmos WFMs for various use cases, from video search and curation to building AI models for self-driving vehicles.</p>

<p>“Generative AI will power the future of mobility, requiring both rich data and very powerful compute,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement. “By working with Nvidia, we are confident that we can help supercharge the timeline for safe and scalable autonomous driving solutions for the industry.”</p>

<p>Important to note is that Nvidia’s world models aren’t “open source” in the strictest sense. To abide by one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/we-finally-have-an-official-definition-for-open-source-ai/">widely accepted definition</a> of “open source” AI, an AI model has to provide enough information about its design so that a person could “substantially” re-create it and disclose any pertinent details about its training data, including the provenance and how the data can be obtained or licensed.</p>

<p>Nvidia hasn’t published Cosmos WFM training data details, nor has it made available all the tools needed to re-create the models from scratch. That’s probably why the tech giant is referring to the models as “open” as opposed to open source.</p>

<p>“We really hope [Cosmos will] do for the world of robotics and industrial AI what Llama … has done for enterprise,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said onstage during a press event on Monday.</p>
