    <h1>Ask HN: I&#39;m disabled and out of money. Now what?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>TL;DR: I&#39;m a founder who had some success, but now I&#39;m disabled, can&#39;t seem to hold down a job.  I&#39;m close to defaulting on my car.  I am (unsurprisingly) depressed.  I need help but don&#39;t know where to go.<p>I spent the 2010s as a founder. My company was funded by YC and several others.  We were moderately successful but didn&#39;t see a meaningful exit.  After my startup failed, I started consulting to pay the bills.</p><p>In 2018 I started having problems with chronic pain and gradually became less and less capable on the job.  Consulting gigs were letting me go because I couldn&#39;t keep up. The last time I worked was over a year ago, and I finally exhausted my savings in early June 2022.</p><p>I live as cheaply as I possibly can at this point.  I live with family and only pay for absolute necessities.  It comes out between $1200 and $1500 per month.</p><p>I&#39;m in the US and I have an application in for SSDI, but, from what I&#39;ve heard, it&#39;s very hard to get benefits, especially if you have an invisible illness like chronic pain.  It&#39;s likely that my application will be initially denied and I will have to focus on an appeal.  It could take a year or more of fighting to be approved.</p><p>I am selling some of my old stuff on eBay but it&#39;s exhausting and frustrating given my limitations.  It&#39;s not sustainable.</p><p>I have a car payment due soon and I&#39;m already behind by one.</p><p>Worst of all, my life is pretty drab at this point.  I am obviously depressed. I see a therapist and a psychiatrist but, fundamentally, the source of my depression is the state of my life. I have nothing to look forward to. I can&#39;t even afford to toss a few bucks into side projects so I at least have something to do with my time... I mostly watch TV, play video games and lurk on the internet. It&#39;s absolutely soul sucking.</p><p>I think, given the right environment, I could finish a weekly workload of a bit less than half-time and slowly re-learn how to work again even with my limitations, but no one wants to hire a middle-aged disabled person for part-time work.  Further, all of my experience is in startups and that makes me less palatable to larger companies, but larger companies have more options to accommodate disabled people.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what to do. Has anyone in the HN community been here?</p><p>EDIT: A few people have asked what I’d like to do if I were to work again.  The answer is that I don’t know!</p><p>Before I started having problems, I was a backend-centric web developer but I’m pretty burned out on that these days.</p><p>I’ve always wanted to get into embedded, but I have no idea if I can make a lateral move like that in my current state.</p><p>Whatever I do, it needs to be with someone who will give me the space to try and fail and try again.  That’s really the main thing.</p><p>Feel free to EMAIL ME:</p><p>tyvm for the shrimp at gmail dot com</p></div></div>
