		<p>Every human being has a little bit of reflux. It’s part of owning a digestive system. For most of us, it’s not a big deal. For a “lucky” few, it’s a painful, debilitating, unpredictable, lifelong curse.</p>

<p>I jumped from the first group to the second around 2015. What started as a side-effect of SSRIs (a not-uncommon thing) became part of the background noise of my life. I’ve given up on being cured of it.</p>

<p>Since onset, though, I’ve learned a few things about how to deal with LPR. Are you a fellow sufferer? Maybe this will be of some use.</p>

<h2 id="a-cautionary-note">A Cautionary Note</h2>

<p>I’m not a doctor. A doctor hasn’t reviewed any of this. I’m a singular person and this is a long piece of N=1 anec-data. Every single point below should be read with that in mind. Be cautious about following any of this advice to the letter.</p>

<p>I did my best to make sure that medical research supports what I tried. Mostly because I was desperate for actual solutions. But I’m not a scientist either.</p>

<p>I drop some brand names. I have no relationships with any of them, and none of the links you’ll find are affiliate links. I list the brands solely because it can be tough to find particular ingredients on your own. If you can find other brands that work for you, vaya con dios amigo.</p>

<p>My ultimate advice is to take what you can use from this, independently verify it (ideally with your doctor), and if any particular point doesn’t work for you, drop it.</p>

<p>That said, I hope this helps.</p>

<h2 id="whats-behind-lpr-mechanically">What’s behind LPR, mechanically?</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, everyone human being has at least a little bit of reflux.</p>

<p>We have two sphincters in our upper digestive tract (that is, the parts of our digestive system above our stomach). The lower esophageal sphincter is between your stomach and your esophagus. The upper esophageal sphincter is between your esophagus and your pharynx (the area near / around the soft palate).</p>

<p>These sphincters are little marvels of engineering. Sealing the pipe of your upper digestive tract so that, for the most part, it’s a one-way tube from mouth to throat to tummy.</p>

<p>The sphincters aren’t perfect. They leak or they jitter, and they let stuff — stomach acid, partially digested food, gas byproducts — flow back up. That’s reflux.</p>

<p>What people call ‘heartburn’ is usually the lower esophageal sphincter malfunctioning. Acid comes up through the sphincter, and burns a little bit in your esophagus, which is in your chest.</p>

<p>With LPR, it’s both sphincters messing up. The lower esophageal sphincter allows some gunk back into the esophagus, and the upper esophageal sphincter lets some portion of that gunk into your the area around your throat. That is, the area around your voice box and your soft palate, or the “laryngo-pharyngeal” zone.</p>

<p>In the least severe cases, it’s small amounts of digestive gasses, that you’ll hopefully belch away without incident. In the worst cases, some hunks of partially-digested food can actually come back up into your mouth. (This has happened to me and it is disgusting and it hurts).</p>

<p>The worst part is that, once the first little bit of up-chuck starts, more will be coming. The acidy reflux irritates and damages your lower esophageal sphincter. An irritated and damaged sphincter is more likely to malfunction. Which means more upchuck. Which means more damage. It’s a vicious cycle.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-lpr-feel-like">What does LPR feel like?</h2>

<p>A variety of things, really.</p>

<p>Many folks with LPR feel heartburn, and other signs you’d call ‘indigestion’. More characteristically, they feel symptoms in their throat. These are what I experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Burning / irritation in the back of my throat (or even in my gums and lips)</li>
  <li>A feeling of constriction in the voicebox, to the point where my voice sounds hoarse, or tight</li>
  <li>A globus sensation, like a wad of something in the throat, that I can’t seem to swallow</li>
  <li>Coughing / gagging, especially if I’m not upright</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this can be pretty bad. The burning may be my least favorite. It’s sort of like when you eat something very spicy, but for days or weeks at a time. While it’s going on, I can’t tolerate a lot of my favorite foods. At its very worst (around May of 2025) I couldn’t even swallow white rice. I had to limit myself to liquid foods for a few days after.</p>

<p>These are just a subset of possible symptoms. It’s possible to feel LPR all the way up in your nose, and get symptoms that feel like seasonal allergies or a cold. Some folks get it so bad that they get permanent anatomical changes in their voicebox, their breathing never quite returns to normal, the backs of their teeth start to wear away. The continuous irritation may contribute to something called Barrett’s Esophagus, which is a precursor to esophageal cancer.</p>

<p>If you got it bad, it’s probably worth your time to see a gastroenterologist. They may suggest an endoscopy. I got one, which saw nothing except some irritation, and it was a huge load off my mind.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-be-sure-i-have-lpr">How can I be sure I have LPR?</h2>

<p>Personally, I say let your symptoms be your guide. If you have the specific, throat-y stuff above, you might have LPR. (Or even if you have a persistent, mysterious sore throat, or a cough you can’t otherwise explain.)</p>

<p>LPR is really tricky to diagnose. An endoscopy can’t even really confirm it. The state-of-the-art is to drop an acid-monitoring tube through your nose, into your throat, and have it sit there for <strong>twenty four hours</strong>, taking pH levels from your soft tissue.</p>

<p>I never did that because it sounds horribly unpleasant. I decided that just having the symptoms was enough for me to believe I had LPR.</p>

<p>For insurance reasons, or for peace of mind, you may want to pursue an official diagnosis. Though I don’t think a diagnosis is required before you try out some of my advice below.</p>

<h2 id="a-theory-of-lpr-symptoms">A theory of LPR symptoms</h2>

<p>No one is 100% sure exactly why LPR happens, or why its symptoms manifest how they do. Which is why it can be tricky to diagnose and treat.</p>

<p>One theory — which I subscribe to — is that pepsin is to blame.</p>

<p>Pepsin is a digestive enzyme. It’s mostly active in highly acidic environments (pH 1-2) like your stomach, which is where it helps to break down food.</p>

<p>If you have LPR, some pepsin can escape your stomach, and settle in to the sensitive tissues around your vocal chords and your throat.</p>

<p>That’s a problem because, along with pepsin, LPR also releases small amounts of acid from your stomach. That lowers the pH in your mouth, your throat, and your voicebox, which activates the pepsin.</p>

<p>In your newly acidified laryngo-pharyngeal zone, the pepsin activates, and starts eating away at the mucosal linings of all the soft tissue in your throat.</p>

<h2 id="a-protocol-for-treatment">A protocol for treatment</h2>

<p>If you accept the above mechanism of action, you’ll probably also agree with what you need to do to fix it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You need to <strong>stop the reflux</strong> from releasing digestive gunk into your mouth</li>
  <li>You need to <strong>neutralize the pepsin</strong> in your mouth and throat, by raising your laryngo-pharyngeal pH</li>
</ol>

<p>This will reduce your symptoms, and give your sphincter a chance to heal. With enough time and care, you have a good chance of getting the reflux under control.</p>

<p>“With enough time” is a loaded phrase. The time-scale for healing is very long. Not days, or weeks, but months. Depending on the severity of a flare-up, it can be well over half a year before you’re ready to eat as normal. If then. Multi-year recoveries are not unheard of.</p>

<p>Just trying to set expectations, there.</p>

<h3 id="stopping-the-reflux--with-algae">Stopping the reflux — with algae</h3>

<p>Alginic acid is derived from sea algae. When it comes in contact with highly concentrated acids, it congeals into a plasticky solid. That’s hugely important for reflux sufferers.</p>

<p>We can ingest a little alginic acid, and after a little time bathing our stomach acid, it gels and forms a little floating puck, that <strong>physically blocks the lower esophageal sphincter</strong>. You can see a <a href="https://youtu.be/uK8gR4vqBkM?si=k87GGq89mJSJGcc7&amp;t=101">video of how it works</a>.</p>

<p>The puck stays there for about four hours, before the stomach breaks it down, after which it passes into your digestive tract without leaving a trace. Those four hours are four hours where symptoms are at a minimum (or at least, not getting any worse), and where your lower esophageal sphincter gets a chance to rest.</p>

<p>I never experience any side effects, haven’t heard about anyone else getting any either.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to get alginic acid:</p>


<p>Maybe the least fussy way to get the good stuff. Chewable tablets are portable and affordable. You just have to make sure it’s <em>Extra Strength</em> Gaviscon. Other types don’t have alginic acid.</p>

<p>(You’ll find alginic acid under the “inactive ingredients” section on the label. I find that strange, but I’m not the FDA).</p>

<p>These tablets certainly work. But they also have a harsh, stinging feeling when you crunch on them. That may be because you’re actually ingesting the alginic acid directly. Or it may be from the artificial cherry flavoring in the tablet. Don’t quote me on that — I don’t actually know.</p>

<p>My preferred way of getting alginic acid is actually…</p>

<h4 id="reflux-gourmet">Reflux Gourmet</h4>
<p>This is a unique goop that contains sodium alginate, a slight variation on the theme.</p>

<p>Upon contact with your stomach acid, sodium alginate reconfigures into alginic acid, through a process called protonation, which I definitely, 100%, for sure understand, but decline to explain here.</p>

<p>The ultimate effect is the same as the Gaviscon, and it’s much more pleasant going down. The Reflux Gourmet website claims that a chef is responsible for the flavor. It could be true! The flavor’s not bad!</p>

<p>Sizing-wise, you have two options: large, singular tubes, about the size of an expensive bottle of conditioner; or a bag of 30 travel-sized, single serving pouches, which are actually super convenient.</p>

<p>Price is the main drawback with RG. At time of writing (2025-09-24), it’s $28 for the tube, or $36 for the pouches. I keep both around the house more or less constantly, and I consider it money well spent.</p>

<p>You do have a cheaper option, though.</p>

<h4 id="diy-digestive-slurry">DIY Digestive Slurry</h4>
<p>You might think sodium alginate is an esoteric chemical that you’d have trouble scrounging up. Not so!</p>

<p>It’s actually a common food additive. If you’ve ever seen a cooking show where some hot-shot chef whips something into weird little edible pearls, sodium alginate is probably involved.</p>

<p>You can buy the stuff at some specialty food shops. Or you can visit a certain e-retailer whose name I won’t mention.</p>

<p>But once you have the stuff, the other ingredients are easy:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Tums (for the calcium carbonate)</li>
  <li>Baking soda (for sodium bicarb)</li>
  <li>Water</li>
</ol>

<p>Seriously, that’s it. The proportions I used where:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1L of water
20g alginate
12.5g calcium carbonate (tums)
8.5g baking soda</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Put the tums, baking soda, and water into a high-power blender, blend for a long time (really, it will take about 10 minutes), slowly adding your alginate, one 1/4 teaspoon at a time, and you’ll get your slurry. It will not taste that good.</p>

<p>To help on the flavor front, I recommend getting some stevia liquid, some artificial (non citrus!) flavor syrup, and some food dye. This will make your slurry a little more appetizing.</p>

<p>You’ll know you’ve done it right if you can drop some of your slurry into a bowl of white vinegar, and it forms into a rubbery solid. That’s the raft you’re looking for!</p>

<p>With this DIY take, your unit costs will be way better than Reflux Gourmet. I’ve made the slurry myself a couple times, and ultimately decided that RG was worth the convenience.</p>

<h3 id="cranking-up-the-ph--with-alkaline-water">Cranking up the pH — with alkaline water</h3>

<p>All the stuff above aims at keeping symptoms from getting worse. They patch the leaky hole of your sphincter, so that reflux stops coming in. They won’t help your existing symptoms too much.</p>

<p>To calm your throat down, you need to deactivate the pepsin. Pepsin is most active in acidic environments, where the pH is below 7. You need to raise that pH up.</p>

<p>One possible solution I’ve found is alkaline water.</p>

<p>Products abound here. Essentia is probably the most famous. I found that these bottled alkaline waters, the kind you can pick up in a convenience store, are a little <em>too</em> alkaline for me. The 9.5+ pH burns a little, and makes some of my symptoms worse.</p>

<p>The sweet spot for me was a pH of around 8. Easy to do with one of these bottled waters — just mix it with a little water from a tap. That’s what I do when I’m out and about.</p>

<p>At home, I keep a little vial of alkaline drops, which I drop in to my Stanley cup knock-off and sip around the house. They do the trick, at .5% per-mL cost of Essentia (not a real price figure, I’m guestimating, but the drops are certainly a lot cheaper).</p>

<h2 id="the-complete-protocol">The complete protocol</h2>

<p>Okay. We’ve done a lot of work to get to this point. With ingredients in hand, and a basic understanding of the disease, we’re finally ready for the complete rules I follow, whenever LPR symptoms flare up.</p>

<p>(They’re listed in descending order of importance. If you do only one thing, adjust your diet. The other stuff is supplementary, but could help a lot.)</p>

<h3 id="rule-one-tighten-the-diet">Rule One: Tighten the Diet</h3>
<p>You will have to restrict your diet. I’m sorry. There’s no way around it.</p>

<p>Trigger foods vary from person to person, but certain common culprits are no-brainers for elimination.</p>

<p>First up is anything acidic, both from obvious sources and sneaky ones. These are some illustrative examples, some obvious, some not-so-obvious:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Citrus — especially lemons, and E S P E C I A L L Y grapefruit. The residue from a small grapefruit slice in a glass of water was enough to put me in an hours-long flare.</li>
  <li>Tomatoes and tomato products</li>
  <li>Sourdough bread</li>
  <li>Kraft Mac n Cheese</li>
  <li>Most bottled coconut waters</li>
  <li>Most bottled green tea</li>
  <li>Virtually every soft drink (look out especially for malic acid, which is often hidden under the name “natural flavors” or “artificial flavors”)</li>
  <li>Coffee (sadly, sadly, espresso is terrible for LPR — you can dilute it with a lot of soy milk or something, but it’s probably best to avoid altogether)</li>
</ul>

<p>Next is foods that have a relaxing effect on the sphincter. These tend to be fatty and rich:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chocolate</li>
  <li>Butter</li>
  <li>Deep fried stuff</li>
  <li>Fatty meats (I’m a vegetarian, so this is purely theoretical for me, but thought it was worth mentioning)</li>
  <li>Alcohol (I’m sober, now, but when I drank things were definitely worse)</li>
  <li>Mint (probably! The evidence is mixed on this)</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, stuff that can mechanically abrade the sphincter, or aggravate your throat:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Carbonated beverages (belches irritate the sphincter)</li>
  <li>Thick or viscous sauces (the lingering residue is an irritant)</li>
  <li>Anything dry or crumbly (bad for the irritated throat)</li>
  <li>Anything too cold</li>
  <li>Anything too sugary</li>
</ul>

<p>This list of forbidden foods is not exhaustive. You may find that other foods bother you. You should eliminate them. The goal is to get through meals with zero new irritation. That’s the only way things will improve.</p>

<p>In the worst of my flare ups, I could honestly only tolerate liquid foods (vegan protein shakes) and white bread. That lasted for a couple days.</p>

<p>For a minor step up in variety, the safe foods for me were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pita bread</li>
  <li>White and brown rice</li>
  <li>Celery</li>
  <li>Leafy greens</li>
  <li>Boiled, unseasoned baby potatoes</li>
  <li>Watermelon</li>
  <li>Plain cheerios</li>
  <li>Soy milk</li>
  <li>Pea protein powder</li>
  <li>Avocados</li>
</ul>

<p>And honestly that’s pretty much it. Life in the middle of an LPR flare is sad and bland.</p>

<h3 id="rule-two-eat-like-a-bird">Rule Two: Eat Like a Bird</h3>

<p>Eat small quantities, with some frequency.</p>

<p>Having too much food made my condition much worse. The abdominal pressure builds against the lower esophageal sphincter, which is both an irritant and a driver of further reflux.</p>

<p>The weird thing is that starving myself was no help. I don’t understand the forces at work, there, but hunger was a reliable trigger of pain in the throat. Maybe this has something to do with the undiluted acid content of an empty stomach? I’m not sure.</p>

<p>I found it best to be a little nourished, with some bland food, all the time.</p>

<p>With the exception of bed time. I tried not to eat for the 3 hours before going to sleep. Gave the food a little time to pass through the danger zone of my digestive system, before I went horizontal.</p>

<h3 id="rule-three-alginic-acid-after-every-meal">Rule Three: Alginic Acid, After Every Meal</h3>

<p>Now we finally arrive at the reason for my alginic acid breakdown. This is how you use it.</p>

<p>Take in a dose after you eat. Small snacks are probably okay to leave un-dosed. But anything meal-sized should come with an alginic acid chaser.</p>

<p>This is a big part of why I recommend the Reflux Gourmet travel packets. It’s easy to slip one of those in your pocket before you go out. Plus, you’ll really charm your dining companions when you polish your food off by sucking some caramel algae goop out of a tube. My wife loves it!</p>

<h3 id="rule-four-lukewarm-alkaline-water-almost-constantly">Rule Four: Lukewarm Alkaline Water, Almost Constantly</h3>

<p>The best reason for owning something like a Stanley cup. Fill it up with water, add some alkaline drops (or a mix of Essentia + tap water), and sip it all day.</p>

<p>I recommend small sips, and swishing / gargling too. Remember that you’re not just quenching your thirst. You are also trying to change the pH environment in your mouth. When your LPR is blasting your mouth with acid, you need a near-constant basic countermeasure. Sip as often as you can.</p>

<p>Though, again, don’t glut yourself. Abdominal pressure from too much water can be just as bothersome as abdominal pressure from too much food. Sip, don’t chug!</p>

<p>Even today, when I’m nearly symptom-free, there is literally no time that I go anywhere without my alkaline drops.</p>

<h3 id="rule-five-fix-your-sleep-posture">Rule Five: Fix Your Sleep Posture</h3>

<p>Bed time is a little fraught for us LPR folk. When you’re upright, gravity helps to keep the acid down. Not so when you’re horizontal.</p>

<p>Sleeping “wrong” could expose your tender throat to 6-8 hours of acid bathing. Not ideal! Small adjustments can help.</p>

<h4 id="sleep-a-little-more-upright">Sleep a little more upright</h4>

<p>The easiest solution to horizontality is sleeping vertical. Oof. Good luck to you if you want to try it. I’ve read about some people sleeping in recliners to help control the reflux. I never did that.</p>

<p>But I did buy a foam ramp to elevate my head and torso. I went with one specialized for side sleepers. Both because that’s how I prefer to sleep, and because, to prevent reflux, it’s also important to…</p>

<h4 id="sleep-on-your-left-side">Sleep on your left side</h4>

<p>The specificity here is a little strange, no? It’s anatomically sensible though. The opening to your stomach is near your heart, which is on the left side of your body. If you’re turned on that side, you have a little help from gravity to prevent acid from reaching your throat.</p>

<h3 id="rule-six-gum-gum">Rule Six: Gum! Gum!!</h3>

<p>Finally, my last and most questionable piece of advice: chew tons of gum.</p>

<p>I think this helped my symptoms, but I wouldn’t swear to it under oath. Supposedly the chewing helps to release extra saliva, which dilutes digestive acid, and raises the pH in your upper GI tract.</p>

<p>The type of gum matters. Sugary gum is out. So is minty gum. Aspartame probably won’t do you too many favors either.</p>

<p>That leaves xylitol gum, with non-minty flavors. For me, that came down to a singular brand: Pur.</p>

<p>It’s not bad, though the flavor fades pretty quickly.</p>

<p>I chewed so much gum, so often, and so <em>hard</em> that I think it may have changed the shape of my jaw. Maybe that’s a teachable moment, and you shouldn’t be like me.</p>

<p>Though I won’t be giving up the gum anytime soon.</p>

<h3 id="some-additional-maybes">Some Additional Maybes</h3>

<p>Two things I think may have helped me, but are significantly more controversial in the medical literature are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Omeprazole 
I took 20mg of omeprazole every day during the worst of my LPR episodes. Chronic use of these drugs is <em>not</em> recommended. And the literature suggests that omeprazole does — literally — nothing to help LPR symptoms. Maybe I placeboe’d myself here. Or took them out of fear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calcium glycerophosphate (Prerelief)
When I was ready to try riskier foods, I took some Prerelief beforehand. It seemed to help things like coffee and pasta-sauce go down easier. But again, this is not a hill I’d die on. Evidence seems mixed about it, and I don’t recommend this with a lot of confidence. Could be worth a shot, though.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
