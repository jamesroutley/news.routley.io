    <p>A friend of mine asked for some recommendations about where to go while visiting the city and I remembered that I wrote up a guide years ago (pre-pandemic). I finally had some time to sit down, verify that everything still exists post-pandemic, and update/add some recs to the list.</p>

<p>It seemed silly to keep this private after putting so much work into it, so it’s now available for all to see!</p>
