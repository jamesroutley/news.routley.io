    <h1>Jackdaw Update (February 2026)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="indexable">
	      <p>Jackdaw is a free, keyboard-focused Digital Audio Workstation
      (DAW), currently in progress. <a href="https://github.com/chvolow24/jackdaw">Source code and a user
      manual are available on github</a>.</p>
      <p>In May of last year, I checked out a git branch ambitiously
      named <code>midi</code>, thereby dooming Jackdaw’s main branch to
      months of neglect.</p>
      <p>Until today! Branch <code>midi</code> has been merged.</p>
      <p>This update includes a whole lot, much of which has nothing to
      do with MIDI. In fact, it’s too much to write about in a single
      post, but I’m going to do that anyway.</p>
      
      <h2 id="not-midi">Not MIDI</h2>
      <p>This section enumerates visible changes to Jackdaw since last
      May that are not related to MIDI; under-the-hood changes
      (refactors), of which there have been many, are not described.</p>
      <h3 id="clip-bounds">Clip bounds</h3>
      <p>All of the audio clips you see on the timeline are really “clip
      references”: windows into the underlying audio data. When you
      first record or import a clip, this window includes all of the
      available audio data. But cutting the clip (<code>S-c</code>) or
      using <a href="https://github.com/chvolow24/jackdaw/?tab=readme-ov-file#source-mode">source
      mode</a> can result in one or more partial windows into the
      underlying audio data.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
      <p>Now, you can directly adjust those windows with a new suite of
      tools. It works the same as grabbing and dragging clips; in
      addition to grabbing and moving the clips themselves, you can now
      grab and move the <em>edges</em> of those clips.</p>
      <p>The keyboard commands use <code>g</code> (which is bound to
      <code>Grab clip at cursor</code>) as a modifier key, and
      <code>j</code> and <code>l</code> for “left” and “right”,
      respectively (analogous to <code>j</code> = rewind and
      <code>l</code> = play).</p>
      <p>So to grab the left edge, position the cursor over the clip and
      do <code>g-j</code> (hold g and tap j). To grab the right edge,
      <code>g-l</code>. If dragging is active (<code>C-k</code>), moving
      the playhead will also move the grabbed edges.</p>
      <p><img src="https://pilk.website/assets/jackdaw_gifs/grab_edge_move.gif"/>
      <br/></p>
      <p>Arrows are displayed when there’s “room” on either side of the
      clip, i.e. there’s audio data beyond the current window.</p>
      <p>You can cut a clip and automatically grab both edges of the cut
      to move the cut position with <code>g-c</code>
      (<code>Cut clip at cursor and grab edges</code>):</p>
      <p><img src="https://pilk.website/assets/jackdaw_gifs/grab_cut_and_drag.gif"/>
      <br/></p>
      <p>If a clip edge is grabbed but you want to grab the whole clip
      instead (e.g. to move it in its entirety), you can use
      <code>g-k</code> to <code>Ungrab clip edge</code>. So it’s very
      easy to cycle between grabbing either edge or the clip itself with
      <code>g-j</code>, <code>g-k</code>, <code>g-l</code>:</p>
      <p><img src="https://pilk.website/assets/jackdaw_gifs/grab_edge_cycle.gif"/>
      <br/></p>
      <h3 id="clip-gain">Clip gain</h3>
      <p>You can set and adjust a gain value for a clip by
      Shift-clicking it, and dragging the mouse up or down. This is a
      non-destructive edit; the underlying audio is unchanged.</p>
      <p>To reset the gain to 0dB, do the same but hold <code>Cmd</code>
      or <code>Ctrl</code> in addition to <code>Shift</code>.</p>
      <p>You can reverse the polarity of the clip by dragging past the
      -∞ dB line.</p>
      <p><img src="https://pilk.website/assets/jackdaw_gifs/clipref_gain.gif"/>
      <br/></p>
      <h3 id="click-track-changes">Click track changes</h3>
      <p>Click tracks got a significant overhaul in service of some
      MIDI-related things. One visible sign of the change is that tempo
      BPM values no longer need to be integers. (Don’t ask me why the
      original implementation required them to be integers.)</p>
      <h4 id="freeze-click-track">“Freeze” click track</h4>
      <p>Jackdaw provides a lot of flexibility that you’ll almost never
      need with respect to click track placement; you can create a bunch
      of click tracks and move them up and down the timeline to your
      heart’s content. Placement is not strictly cosmetic: each Track is
      “governed” by the click track positioned nearest above it on the
      timeline, so when you need to do grid-related things on a track
      (e.g. jumping to the next beat position with <code>C-l</code>, or
      adding notes in the piano roll), you can control <em>which</em>
      grid you’re using.</p>
      <p>The downside of this design is that if you have a bunch of
      tracks and scroll down, the click track you’re using may no longer
      be visible.</p>
      <p>To solve this, you can now “freeze” a click track at the top of
      the timeline view, and it will remain fixed there regardless of
      how you scroll. You do this simply by moving (<code>S-p</code>)
      the click track “all the way up”:</p>
      <p><img src="https://pilk.website/assets/jackdaw_gifs/freeze_click_track.gif"/></p>
      <p>(Note that the frozen click track covers over the timecode
      view, so it’s unfortunately one or the other for now.)</p>
      <p>You “unfreeze” the click track by selecting it (repeat
      <code>p</code> or <code>d</code> until you’re “all the way up”)
      and moving it down (<code>S-n</code>):</p>
      <h4 id="metronome-customization">Metronome customization</h4>
      <p>I always wanted a “swing” metronome: instead of clicks on every
      beat, your bandleader snaps on beats two and four. You can do this
      now (among other things) by setting which metronome sound plays on
      each of the following:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>measure boundaries</li>
      <li>beat boundaries</li>
      <li>even beats (2 &amp; 4 in 4/4) only</li>
      <li>subdivisions (e.g. eighths)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>These options can be found in the second tab of the click track
      settings tab view (select a click track (<code>n</code> and
      <code>p</code>) and then <code>S-t</code> to open the tab view,
      and <code>S-l</code> to tab right).</p>
      <p>There are two finger snap recordings included along with the
      default sounds. You can’t add your own sounds yet, but that option
      shouldn’t be difficult to add in the future.</p>
      <h4 id="tempo-changes">Tempo changes</h4>
      <p>Tempo changes now affect the placement of clips, MIDI notes and
      pitch bend, and automation keyframes. <a href="#click-track-edits-and-object-placement">More on this below,
      in the context of MIDI note quantization</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="multi-channel-audio-devices">Multi-channel audio
      devices</h3>
      <p>Jackdaw is still natively stereo, and does not support audio
      output with more than two channels. But you can now connect
      multi-channel devices (e.g. audio interfaces) and selectively
      record from adjacent stereo pairs of channels. For example, when
      you connect a 4-channel interface, you will have the option to
      record from channels (1,2) or (3,4). It is also now true that mono
      audio inputs (like the built-in microphone on most laptops) record
      mono clips, and not redundant stereo. (Jackdaw tracks are flexible
      – they can hold mono or stereo clips, MIDI or audio; a Track is
      just a Track. This idea will extend to buses, too).</p>
      <p>There’s no option for the user to configure the device channel
      groupings manually, but you can effectively achieve any result
      with <code>Split stereo clip at cursor to mono</code>, then mixing
      the new mono clips in stereo with panning, exporting a mixdown
      (<code>S-w</code>) and re-importing it (<code>C-o</code>), or
      using the <code>Jackdaw out</code> audio input to record a stereo
      mixdown on the fly. I’ll add device configuration later.</p>
      <p>I improved the code that handles device
      connection/disconnection events; it should always be possible to
      use a new device connected during runtime, and disconnecting a
      device should never cause a crash. (This is unfortunately not true
      of MIDI devices, because neither SDL2 nor PortMidi reports when a
      MIDI device has been added or removed.)</p>
      <h3 id="build-system">Build system</h3>
      <p>SDL2 and SDL2_ttf are now included in the project as git
      submodules, as is PortMidi. The Makefile included with Jackdaw now
      builds each of those dependencies locally (i.e., will not install
      anything on your system), and links to static builds of each when
      constructing the Jackdaw binary.</p>
      <p>So, to build a self-contained copy of Jackdaw on your machine,
      the following should usually be sufficient:</p>
      <div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>$</span> git clone <span>--recurse-submodules</span> https://github.com/chvolow24/jackdaw.git</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>$</span> cd jackdaw</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>$</span> make</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>CMake is required to build PortMidi, and GNU autotools is
      required to configure and build SDL2 and SDL2_ttf. For its part,
      Jackdaw just uses GNU Make.</p>
      <p><code>make clean</code> cleans Jackdaw’s build objects only.
      <code>make cleanall</code> also cleans the dependencies.
      <code>make debug</code> creates a debug build.</p>

      <h2 id="midi">MIDI</h2>
      <p>So far, the MIDI functionality in Jackdaw can only be used to
      control the built-in synthesizer. But it’ll do more in the future,
      and the built-in synth is more powerful than you might expect.
      With the QWERTY piano emulator, you can start making your own
      sounds in Jackdaw immediately, without an external device.</p>
      <h3 id="basics-io-midi-clips">Basics (I/O, MIDI Clips)</h3>
      <p>Tracks in Jackdaw are not “audio tracks” or “MIDI tracks” –
      they are just Tracks. You can record MIDI data onto a track
      exactly like you would record audio: first, select one of the MIDI
      devices from list of available inputs (<code>C-S-i</code>, or
      click the track input box); then, hit <code>r</code> to start
      recording. A pink MIDI clip will appear on the track, and any
      notes you play on the MIDI device will be recorded to that clip.
      Hit <code>r</code> again to stop recording.</p>
      <p><img src="https://pilk.website/assets/jackdaw_gifs/record_midi.gif"/></p><p>
      Recording MIDI with the QWERTY piano emulator
      </p>
      <p>MIDI clips can also be manipulated exactly like audio clips.
      You can grab them, move them around, copy them, and adjust their
      bounds. (Source mode does not currently work with MIDI clips,
      however).</p>
      <h3 id="synthesizer">Synthesizer</h3>
      <p>Each Track has its own synth, and MIDI is played back through
      the synth by default. The synth is opened with
      <code>S-s</code>.</p>
      <p>(There’s a <code>Track set MIDI out</code> command, which could
      be used for other instruments or external devices in the future;
      for now it’s useless.)</p>
      <h4 id="oscillators">Oscillators</h4>
      <p>Jackdaw’s synthesizer has four “base oscillators” with
      selectable waveform types (sine, triangle, square, saw). Each of
      the base oscillators can be replicated in up to 7 unison voices,
      which can be detuned and spread across the stereo field. The base
      oscillators can be tuned (octave, coarse, and fine tuning)
      individually, or set to a fixed frequency.</p>
      <p>By default, the four base oscillators are added together.
      However, you can also set one oscillator to modulate the frequency
      or amplitude of another. Modulation can be used to create new
      timbres or, when the modulator is set to a low frequency, to
      create vibrato (frequency) or tremolo (amplitude). When a given
      base oscillator is being modulated by another, the appropriate
      <code>Is carrier</code> red status light will be lit.</p>
      <p><img src="https://pilk.website/assets/jackdaw_gifs/synth_mod.gif"/></p>
      <p>By default, the phase of all oscillators (i.e. all of the base
      oscillators and their unison voices) will be reset when a new note
      is triggered. You can turn this off by unchecking the
      <code>Sync phase</code> toggle. In general, <em>not</em> syncing
      phase is preferable for more heterogeneous sounds, like orchestral
      strings. It introduces an element of chaos into the sound, and is
      often undesirable for things like bass instruments, where phase
      differences can unexpectedly and dramatically mute or amplify a
      sound.</p>
      <h4 id="amplitude-envelope">Amplitude envelope</h4>
      <p>The synth uses a conventional ADSR envelope. The
      <code>Ramp exponent</code> parameter sets an exponent value for
      each ramp; as that value increases past 1.0, the shape of the
      decay and release ramps change gradually from something that looks
      like “\” to something that looks closer to “L”. In other words, a
      ramp exponent of 1.0 gives a linear decay, 2.0 gives quadratic
      decay, etc.</p>
      <h4 id="noise">Noise</h4>
      <p>White noise can be introduced into the sound and controlled by
      its own amplitude envelope. Even if the noise envelope is enabled,
      the noise sound still passes through the main amplitude envelope
      and the filter.</p>
      <h4 id="filter">Filter</h4>
      <p>The filter is a one-pole resonant lowpass Chebyshev filter. The
      controls are, I think, slightly unconventional. The
      <code>Base cutoff</code> parameter sets a <em>lower bound</em> for
      the filter cutoff frequency. The <code>Key tracking</code>
      parameter adds a multiple of the current note frequency to the
      base cutoff. <code>Velocity tracking</code> <em>attenuates</em>
      (brings down) the cutoff frequency when the note has
      less-than-full velocity, more so for higher values of the
      parameter. (So, bring this slider all the way up if you want
      maximum expressivity). <code>Env amount</code> <em>adds</em> to
      the cutoff frequency an amount that changes dynamically with the
      filter’s envelope.</p>
      <p>The filter cutoff tracks the amplitude envelope by default, but
      can be given its own ADSR shape when <code>Use amp env</code> is
      unchecked. The effect is most obvious when the amp envelope has a
      short attack, and the filter envelope is given a longer attack,
      producing a “wah” sound.</p>
      <h4 id="effects">Effects</h4>
      <p>When effects are added directly to the synth (instead of to its
      parent Track), they are heard even when the synth is being
      monitored directly, i.e., while you are playing. Delay lines and
      saturation sound excellent on a synth.</p>
      <p>The effects can be re-ordered, deleted, and undeleted exactly
      like track effects. They are included when a synth preset is
      saved. Unlike track effects, you can’t apply automation to synth
      effect parameters.</p>
      <h4 id="polyphony">Polyphony</h4>
      <p>The synth can be used polyphonically with up to 24 voices (the
      default), or in mono mode. When voice-stealing is enabled, the
      oldest (longest-held) voice is stolen first.</p>
      <p>Portamento applies to pitch and velocity in mono mode, but also
      polyphonically when the special <code>Poly portamento mode</code>
      is enabled.</p>
      <h5 id="poly-portamento-mode">Poly portamento mode</h5>
      <p>Enable voice sliding in a polyphonic context by:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Enabling <code>Poly portamento mode</code> (make sure
      <code>Mono mode</code> is off), and</li>
      <li>Reducing the number of voices.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>When a voice is stolen (and only then), the stolen voice slides
      to the destination note instead of being silenced.</p>
      <p>Poly portamento mode implements heuristic voice-leading, so the
      rules for voice stealing are slightly different. When a new note
      occurs and all available voices are in use, those that have been
      released (finger no longer on key, but note amp envelope still in
      release) are checked first, and the <em>nearest one</em> in terms
      of pitch is used. If all of the voices in use are still being
      held, then the nearest one of <em>those</em> is used.</p>
      <p>Here’s an example (a single track) of how this can sound with
      three-voice polyphony.</p>
      
      <h4 id="presets">Presets</h4>
      <p>Synth settings can be saved in a preset file, which has the
      <code>.jsynth</code> file extension. You can open a preset in
      three ways:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>With <code>C-o</code> (standard <code>Open file</code>)</li>
      <li>By opening the synth with <code>S-s</code>, navigating to the
      <code>Presets</code> tab, and selecting
      <code>Open preset</code></li>
      <li>At start time, on the command line
      (<code>./jackdaw path_to_preset_file</code>)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>When you open a new preset, it will override all of the current
      synth settings – but you can undo and redo this action, so nothing
      will be lost.</p>
      <p>You can save the current preset by navigating to the
      <code>Presets</code> tab and selecting
      <code>Save preset as...</code></p>
      <h3 id="qwerty-piano-emulator">QWERTY piano emulator</h3>
      <p>Jackdaw provides the QWERTY piano emulator as a way for you to
      play the synth or otherwise record MIDI without an external MIDI
      controller. You can activate it with the
      <code>Activate QWERTY piano</code> command, which is bound to
      <code>S-q</code>. Deactivate with the same (<code>S-q</code>) or
      with <code>&lt;esc&gt;</code>.</p>
      <p>If you want to record MIDI data using the QWERTY piano, set the
      track input accordingly, and then hit <code>r</code> to record.
      You cannot stop recording with <code>r</code> like usual (it is
      too easy to do this accidentally), but escaping with
      <code>S-q</code> or <code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> does the job.</p>
      <h3 id="piano-roll">Piano roll</h3>
      <p>The piano roll view can be used to edit or create new MIDI
      clips.</p>
      <p>To enter the view, use
      <code>Edit clip at cursor / open piano roll</code>, which is bound
      to <code>C-S-e</code>. If the cursor (the <a href="https://github.com/chvolow24/jackdaw/?tab=readme-ov-file#cursor">Jackdaw
      cursor</a>, not mouse) is over a MIDI clip, that clip is opened in
      the piano roll view; otherwise, a new clip is created.</p>
      <p>The piano roll controls are designed to be analogous or
      identical to timeline controls. Notes in the piano roll view are
      analogous to clips in the timeline view.</p>
      <h4 id="navigation">Navigation</h4>
      <p>All of these are exactly the same as in the timeline view:
      <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>l</code> for
      rewind/pause/play, <code>,</code> and <code>.</code> to zoom,
      <code>h</code> and <code>;</code> to move the view left and right,
      <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> to move the playhead (without
      playback), etc.</p>
      <p>If there is a grid enabled (a click track is positioned
      somewhere above the current track), then all of the bars/beats
      navigation commands work the same as well: <code>C-j</code> and
      <code>C-l</code> to go to the previous/next beat,
      <code>C-S-j</code> and <code>C-S-l</code> to go the the
      previous/next subdivision, and <code>A-S-j</code> and
      <code>A-S-l</code> to move to the previous/next measure.</p>
      <p>In timeline view, <code>S-j</code> and <code>S-l</code> move
      the cursor to the previous/next <em>clip</em> boundary; in piano
      roll view, these commands (<code>Go to previous note</code>,
      <code>Go to next note</code>) move the cursor to the previous/next
      <em>note</em> boundary.</p>
      <p><img src="https://pilk.website/assets/jackdaw_gifs/piano_roll_nav.gif"/></p>
      <h4 id="note-insertion-manual">Note insertion (manual)</h4>
      <p>(NOTE: It is usually much faster to <a href="#note-insertion-with-midi-device">insert notes with a MIDI
      device</a>, including the built-in QWERTY piano emulator).</p>
      <p>The “note selector” can be moved up and down with
      <code>n</code> and <code>p</code> (or <code>d</code> and
      <code>f</code>) just like the track selector.</p>
      <p>Hit <code>&lt;ret&gt;</code> to insert a note at the current
      position. You will hear the note played back (at an arbitrary
      short duration) through the track’s synth.</p>
      <p>Hit <code>&lt;spc&gt;</code> to insert a rest.</p>
      <p>If you make a mistake, hit <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> (or the
      backspace key) to “undo” it.</p>
      <p>The duration of the next note (or rest) to be inserted is
      adjusted with <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>; velocity with
      <code>c</code> and <code>v</code>.</p>
      <p>By default, the cursor (playhead) jumps the right edge of the
      inserted note. You can prevent this by enabling “chord mode”
      (<code>S-h</code>). Disabling chord mode then moves the cursor
      forward to the end of the chord (or the shortest note in the
      chord, if they have different durations).</p>
      <p>“Tie mode” extends the last-inserted note instead of inserting
      a new one, provided that the playhead is still positioned at the
      of the last note, and the new insertion is on the same actual note
      (pitch) or notes (chord). So you can achieve, e.g., a dotted
      quarter by setting an eighth note duration, enabling tie mode, and
      hitting <code>ret</code> three times.</p>
      <p>(The only time you would <em>not</em> want tie mode is enabled
      is if you want to restrike notes immediately upon release.)</p>
      <h4 id="note-insertion-with-midi-device">Note insertion (with MIDI
      device)</h4>
      <p>When the track input is set to a connected MIDI device OR when
      the QWERTY piano emulator is active, notes can be inserted simply
      by striking the keys of the device. Velocity and pitch are
      determined by the note you play, not by the piano roll input
      controls. Chords are detected (keystrokes occur within ~60ms of
      one another) and inserted as such.</p>
      <p>Duration is still set with <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>,
      and rests are still inserted with <code>&lt;spc&gt;</code>.
      <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> (backspace) is the same.</p>
      <p>“Tie mode” works exactly the same. (So does “Chord mode,”
      though I can think of no reason to use it here.)</p>

      “Do you think you’re better off alone?”
      </p>
      <h4 id="grabbing-and-moving-notes">Grabbing and moving notes</h4>
      <p><strong>Notes can be grabbed, moved, truncated, and extended
      exactly like clips</strong>. That means all of the edge grabbing
      behavior described above for clips applies here as well.</p>
      <p><img src="https://pilk.website/assets/jackdaw_gifs/drag_note.gif"/></p>
      <p>You can also grab notes with the mouse by Cmd- or Ctrl-
      clicking the screen and dragging a box around the notes:</p>
      <p><img src="https://pilk.website/assets/jackdaw_gifs/piano_roll_grab_with_mouse.gif"/></p>
      <h3 id="quantization">Quantization</h3>
      <p>In the piano roll view, or timeline view with a MIDI clip under
      the cursor, use <code>Quantize notes (clip at cursor)</code> –
      <code>A-q</code> – to quantize the notes. You can set an
      <code>Amount</code>; an amount of 1.0 places the affected notes
      exactly on the gridlines (fully quantized), whereas an amount
      &lt;1.0 will simply move them closer to those gridlines. This can
      serve as a quick and dirty way to clean up a performance without
      making it sound completely robotic. When
      <code>Quantize note offs</code> is unchecked, each note retains
      its original duration.</p>
      <p>When notes have been quantized, their original positions will
      be shown by an empty grey box in the piano roll view.</p>
      <p>You can adjust the quantization amount after the notes have
      been quantized with <code>Adjust quantize amount</code>,
      <code>A-S-q</code>. This will only apply to notes that have
      already been quantized.</p>
      <p>WARNING: If you move a note or clip after it has been
      quantized, and then adjust the quantization amount without
      re-quantizing, information about the note or clip move will be
      lost. Adjusting the quantize amount always refers back to the
      position the notes were in when they were originally
      quantized.</p>
      <h4 id="click-track-edits-and-object-placement">Click track edits
      and object placement</h4>
      <p>Changing the tempo of click track segment now moves clips,
      notes, and automation keyframes for all tracks using that click
      track. You can also now change the tempo by holding
      <code>Cmd-</code> or <code>Ctrl-</code> and clicking and dragging
      the click track horizontally.</p>
      <p><img src="https://pilk.website/assets/jackdaw_gifs/click_track_tempo_change.gif"/></p>
      <p>If you want to edit a click track without moving these objects,
      you can first move the click track to the bottom of the timeline,
      or temporarily insert another click track below the one you wish
      to edit, “blocking” it. I recognize this may not be ideal, and may
      refine the feature later.</p>
      <h3 id="midi-controllers">MIDI controllers</h3>
      <p>You can use the physical controllers (knobs, sliders) on your
      MIDI controller to control synth parameters. With the synth tab
      view open, simply select a slider (<code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> to
      move the selection forward, <code>S-&lt;tab&gt;</code> to move
      back, or just click the slider), and then turn the knob on your
      keyboard. This will automatically bind that physical controller to
      that slider in Jackdaw.</p>
      <p>If you want to un-bind the controller, you can do so by holding
      down the <code>Alt</code> or <code>Option</code> key and turning
      the physical knob again.</p>
      <p>This is a brand new feature and has not been thoroughly
      tested.</p>
      
      <h4 id="midi-files">MIDI files</h4>
      <p>Jackdaw can read MIDI files (<code>.mid</code> or
      <code>.midi</code>). This feature is filed under “extra” because,
      as far as I know, people don’t use MIDI files much anymore, and
      also because it’s quite bad. But I’ve tested it with a number of
      free MIDI files I found online and it mostly works.</p>
      <p>You can open a MIDI file exactly like you would a .wav or .jdaw
      file (<code>C-o</code>, on the command line at start time, or
      drag-and-drop). If the number of tracks in the file exceeds what
      you have on your timeline, Jackdaw will ask if you want to add
      more tracks. The click track part of this is one of the things
      that works quite badly – sorry about that.</p>
      <h4 id="jlily-lilypond">JLily (LilyPond)</h4>
      <p><a href="https://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a> is a fantastic
      music engraving software and markup language. Jackdaw can parse a
      very limited (and slightly altered) subset of the language, called
      JLily, as a way to create new MIDI clips.</p>
      <p>JLily uses relative mode by default, with middle C as the
      starting reference pitch.</p>
      <p>This feature actually has a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp8o8q8fw9o">video
      demo</a>.</p><p>
      Supported syntax:
      </p><pre>         - note names
             e.g.        &#34;c g g a g&#34;
             
         - duration
             e.g.        &#34;c4 g8 g a g&#34;

             e.g.        &#34;c4 g8. g16 aes4 g r b c c,&#34;
             
         - repeats
             e.g.        &#34;\repeat 4 { c16, c&#39; }&#34;
                          (repeat ^ times)
                          
         - nested repeats
             e.g.        &#34;\repeat 16 { \repeat 4 {c, c&#39;} \repeat 4 {g, g&#39;} }&#34;
             
         - set velocity (JLILY ONLY, not standard lilypond)

      <h3 id="sound-examples">Sound examples</h3>
      <p>I haven’t had time to sit down and really work on music, but
      I’ve been making little things as I go, testing new features.</p>
      <p><strong>All</strong> of the audible sounds in these examples
      were produced by Jackdaw’s synth, and edited exclusively in
      Jackdaw (except wav-&gt;mp3 conversion); there’s no imported or
      recorded audio. The MIDI data was also recorded in Jackdaw except
      where noted.</p>
      
      
      
      <div>
      <p>a short MIDI loop produced in my friend River’s <a href="https://clavier36.com/">Clavier 36</a>, altered a bit in

      <h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h2>
      
      <p>There are many, many things I would like to add to Jackdaw. I
      also think it’s important for me to formally release v1 this
      summer, and there’s no way I’ll get to all of it.</p>
      <p>I’m considering a few things “essential”:</p>
      <h5 id="mixing-tools-buses-audio-routing-mixer-view">Mixing tools
      (buses, audio routing, mixer view)</h5>
      <p>The biggest barrier to success I see here is figuring out how
      to represent audio routing in the GUI in a way that won’t take
      months.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
      <h5 id="reverb">Reverb</h5>
      <p>Probably for v1, because it’s also a fundamental mixing tool
      and I have all of the rudiments I need to do the implementation. I
      will have to be careful not to spend too much time on this,
      because I’m sure I could tune it and add parameters forever.</p>
      <h5 id="read-write-other-file-types-libavcodec">Read / write other
      file types (libavcodec)</h5>
      <p>Of course you should be able to open or export mp3s, flacs, ogg
      vorbis, etc. I will use libavcodec <a href="https://pilk.website/3/www.ffmpeg.org/">(from
      FFMPEG)</a> for this, so I just need to figure out the best way to
      package and employ it.</p>
      
      <p>Everything else – it pains me – may have to wait until after
      the v1 release. But if life allows, I absolutely intend to
      continue with these additions, and more.</p>
      <h5 id="a-sampling-instrument">A sampling instrument</h5>
      <p>Record or import a clip, load it to a range of MIDI notes, and
      play it back through your keyboard. The absolute simplest
      implementation of this might be pretty easy, but how long before I
      want to do things like identify transients, add velocity-dependent
      processing, etc. The supporting UX will take some time.</p>
      <h5 id="a-better-pure-data-integration">A better <a href="https://puredata.info/">Pure Data</a> integration</h5>
      <p>The vision:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>you can add a <strong>Pd effect</strong> to an effect chain in
      Jackdaw. This opens a blank Pure Data patch with an input object
      (which supplies the pre-processed signal from Jackdaw), and an
      output object (for returning the processed signal to
      Jackdaw).</li>
      <li>you can add a <strong>Pd instrument</strong> which opens a
      patch that is the same except that the input object provides MIDI
      data from Jackdaw instead of audio.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I have ideas for how to do this, but it’s very challenging.</p>
      <h5 id="clap-support">CLAP support</h5>
      <p>The <a href="https://cleveraudio.org/">“Clever Audio
      Plug-In”</a> purports to be a simpler alternative to VST. I intend
      to make Jackdaw a CLAP host eventually; I simply don’t have any
      sense of how difficult it will be, and how long it will take.</p>
      <p>(I do have a sense that adequate VST support would be very
      difficult and take a long time, so it’s not happening anytime
      soon.)</p>
      <h5 id="looping-constructs">Looping constructs</h5>
      <p>You can copy-paste clips, and you can loop playback over a
      particular section of the timeline, but Jackdaw needs a way to
      take a section of a track and repeat it N times. Relatedly, I need
      to figure out how to practically replicate and move ranges of
      automation keyframes – this is quite difficult given the way I
      wrote the automation feature.</p>
      <h5 id="control-signal-routing">Control signal routing</h5>
      <p>I would like it to be possible to create rules like: if the
      volume <code>v</code> of Track 1 changes, write
      <code>v * 0.5 + 0.3</code> to the volume of Track 2. The <a href="https://charlie-volow.com/blog/posts/endpoints.html">Endpoint
      abstraction</a> gets me most of the way there.</p>
      <h5 id="native-system-file-dialogues-andor-improved-filesystem-navigation">Native
      system file dialogues and/or improved filesystem navigation</h5>
      <p>E.g. when opening files. I have plenty of ideas for how I would
      like this to work, but it’s all a lot of work.</p>
      <h5 id="manual-serializationdeserialization---sqlite">Manual
      serialization/deserialization -&gt; <a href="#https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a></h5>
      <p>Serializing and deserializing Jackdaw project files
      (<code>.jdaw</code>) is a pain, especially since I’m always adding
      new things that need to be serialized. I am also, against reason,
      maintaining backward compatibility (mostly). Using SQLite for
      project files would simplify some, but not all, aspects of the
      problem, in addition to affording some fun hacking
      opportunities.</p>
      <h5 id="sdl2---portaudio">SDL2 -&gt; PortAudio</h5>
      <p>I’m using SDL2’s audio API, which I quite like, but it cannot
      be used to do latency compensation.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> PortAudio seems like it would
      be better for this.</p>
      <h5 id="sdl2---sdl3">SDL2 -&gt; SDL3</h5>
      <p>I’m not aware of an actual reason to this right now except for
      a feeling that I probably should.</p>
      <h5 id="ux">UX</h5>
      <p>The foundational goal of Jackdaw, to the extent that there was
      one, was to write a piece of software that I can use to make
      music, that works the way I want it to. As the project got more
      serious, the target audience expanded, and the one goal naturally
      split into two, each of which is very ambitious on its own:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Write a DAW</li>
      <li>Encourage users to adopt an unfamiliar computer interaction
      paradigm without alienating them</li>
      </ol>
      <p>(By “unfamiliar computer interaction paradigm” I mean primarily
      using the computer keyboard in places where using the mouse, GUI
      buttons, toolbars, etc. would feel more familiar.)</p>
      <p>Although goal 2 is an omnipresent guiding hand in all of the
      work I’ve done on this project, it also requires dedicated
      attention, and I’ve been pretty focused on goal 1 for a while.
      Among the things that I would like to do in service of goal 2:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>a more structured view of available commands
      <ul>
      <li>basically an integration of the autocomplete command lookup
      interface (<code>/</code>) and menus (<code>C-m</code>)</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>built-in help
      <ul>
      <li>item (e.g. command) descriptions and documentation</li>
      <li>“functional category” documentation, e.g. a page on grabbing
      and moving clips</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>an interactive tutorial</li>
      <li>tutorial videos</li>
      </ul>
