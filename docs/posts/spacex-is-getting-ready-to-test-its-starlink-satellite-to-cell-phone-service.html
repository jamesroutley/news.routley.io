    <h1>SpaceX is getting ready to test its Starlink satellite-to-cell phone service</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last summer, Elon Musk and T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert announced &#34;Coverage Above and Beyond,&#34; a joint initiative that aimed to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-starlink-partnership-012539605.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0">bring Starlink satellite coverage compatible T-Mobile devices</a>. Now, SpaceX is getting ready to begin testing its satellite-to-cellular service.</p>
<p>During a panel at the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1635292849150529537" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0">Satellite Conference and Exhibition 2023</a>, SpaceX VP of Starlink enterprise sales Jonathan Hofeller said the company had plans to &#34;start getting into testing&#34; its satellite-to-cell service this year. &#34;We&#39;re going to learn a lot by doing — not necessarily by overanalyzing — and getting out there, working with the telcos.&#34;</p>
<div id="7517da4af8ed47529d2f2bafbffcce27"><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hofeller: SpaceX plans to &#34;start getting into testing&#34; its Starlink satellite-to-cell service &#34;this year.&#34;</p>— Michael Sheetz (@thesheetztweetz) <a href="https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1635303040826888195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">March 13, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p>Hofeller didn&#39;t specifically say which Telco SpaceX was working with, but the timeline certainly lines up with Musk&#39;s original vision for the T-Mobile partnership. In August, he promised that <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1562956451538014209" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0">Starlink V2 would launch in 2023</a> and would &#34;transmit direct to mobile phones, eliminating dead zones worldwide.&#34; At the time T-Mobile said the service would <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:T-Mobile;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=450bac9f-8d9e-40ec-875c-2beb29a6147c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=T-Mobile&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0NTBiYWM5Zi04ZDllLTQwZWMtODc1Yy0yYmViMjlhNjE0N2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudC1tb2JpbGUuY29tL25ld3MvdW4tY2Fycmllci90LW1vYmlsZS10YWtlcy1jb3ZlcmFnZS1hYm92ZS1hbmQtYmV5b25kLXdpdGgtc3BhY2V4IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhYTc3YzlkZi1lZGQ2LTRhNjUtOGJjOC0xZGNhNjgyNjM1ZmMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQR6tH3h8gXFg0u0dqnSYNze6pJhtzS1KDfkEpN4p7s3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Ft-mobile-takes-coverage-above-and-beyond-with-spacex" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:T-Mobile;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0">give the carrier &#34;near complete coverage&#34; </a>of most of the United States, specifically highlighting areas that are notoriously difficult to find a signal: National Parks, mountain ranges, deserts and other remote locations.</p>
<p>Either way, the panel seemed optimistic about the future of sat-to-cell technology. Lynk Global CEO Charles Miller said that satellite cellular service has the potential to be the &#34;biggest category in satellite,&#34; and Iridium CEO Matt Desch sees cellular satellite service as just the beginning. &#34;Satellite should connect everything everywhere,&#34; he said at the event, imagining the technology connecting to computers, vehicles and more.</p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
