    <h1>Set me right on whether caring is even possible</h1>
    
    
<p>
I know I have a weird and kind of skewed view of the world, since I 
expect nobody else to care about some things, and then the world goes 
and surprises me by jumping on it anyway.  About six months ago, I 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/05/01/feedback/">expected the worst</a>
for my whole &#34;let&#39;s improve the feed reader ecosystem&#34; thoughts, and 
figured it would go unnoticed, and yet it&#39;s been anything but.
</p>
<p>
Clearly, I am miscalibrated for what the world is willing to do.  So, 
with that in mind, I figured that I need to bring more things up in this 
context to see what the reaction is instead of just discarding it early 
due to my own doubts.
</p>
<p>
Tonight&#39;s concern goes like this: I was flipping through some old posts
and ran across something from 2013 where I 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2013/08/01/script/">said</a>
&#34;your simple (shell) script is someone else&#39;s bad day&#34;.  It was
inspired by the &#34;onboarding&#34; process for dev servers at FB which I was 
going through that week, and it was a total shit-show.  It had plenty 
of the aforementioned scripts that you couldn&#39;t restart without making 
things worse.  It took way too long for me to get my hands on a Linux 
box that had things set up so I could crank on stupid www stuff.
</p>
<p>
In re-reading that post the other night, it got me wondering what I 
could do in this space to try to raise awareness of various topics.  
Maybe I&#39;d look at a few old posts, decide that there&#39;s a cluster of 
problems 
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">&#34;idempotence&#34;</a> in
this case), and that maybe it would be a net win for humanity if more 
people were slightly better at it.  Then I&#39;d try to address that 
directly... somehow.
</p>
<p>
My goal would be to get more people in this life who, at least for 
that topic, look at everything they encounter and go &#34;what if this 
fails, and is restarted&#34;.  I basically would love to see more people 
going &#34;what if&#34; for that particular topic.  Worry about the robot and 
the five quarts of oil.  (Go look at the 2013 post if that made no 
sense.)
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s plausible.  I actually worry that it&#39;s not even 
possible for most people, and that caring about such things is some 
weird genetic corner case that is born, not made, and it would be 
unreasonable to expect it from the rest of the world.
</p>
<p>
This is where I need input.  I have this feeling that such topics are 
not seen as important by reasonable people, and that they honestly 
never will be.  Just because it matters to me is no indication that it 
will resonate anywhere else.  That much has been made crystal clear 
over the past few years.
</p>
<p>
Wouldn&#39;t it be amazing, though?  Just imagine it: groups of people 
heading out into the world armed with additional things to consider 
when designing something, and the resulting improvements in reliability 
for the things they work on down the road.
</p>
<p>
Then we&#39;d have to continue on to some other fundamental topic, and try 
to move the needle on that, too.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I should mention another possible outcome: those same people go 
into the world with that knowledge, go to apply it, and run into the 
same brick walls that some of us have already been hitting because 
nobody else sees the point.  They get all bitter and dejected, emit 
their own &#34;delightful burnout sauce&#34; (I love that line, btw), and start 
writing their own screeds on things like this, and we start over.
</p>
<p>
You can bake an amazing cake, but if they aren&#39;t hungry for cake, well, 
you might have just wasted a bunch of time.
