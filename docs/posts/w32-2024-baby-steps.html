<p>After last week&#39;s note, I started thinking about the topics I wanted to learn more about. I was inspired by a fellow Recurser&#39;s <a href="https://ravi.fyi">Learning Sabbatical</a>, which had links to books and other useful resources.</p>
<p>I initially thought of making a similar curriculum (and even made one), but decided to focus on one book after getting started. I found out about <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu">Computer Systems: A Programmer&#39;s Perspective</a> a year ago - a fellow Recurser was reading through the book and recommended it, and I paired on one of the labs. It&#39;s also listed in the Computer Architecture section of the <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com">Teach Yourself Computer Science</a> website.</p>
<p>I read the introductory chapter, and I love the book. The language is easy to understand, and I&#39;m finally making sense of terminology I&#39;ve vaguely heard of but didn&#39;t understand properly.</p>
<p>Reading the book in order has proved to be a bad idea in the past, so I&#39;m trying a &#34;choose your adventure&#34; style of reading, where I decide the order of chapters as I go.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve currently reading a chapter about Linkers, and there&#39;s a lot to process. I would ideally like to solidify my knowledge by some combination of code + blog posts, so that&#39;s something to think about.</p>
<h2 id="attempt-at-installing-linux-on-a-mac"><a href="#attempt-at-installing-linux-on-a-mac">Attempt at installing Linux on a Mac</a></h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been curious on what it would be like to have Linux as the main OS on a machine, as I mostly use macOS and my usage of Linux is limited to Virtual Machine where I mainly use the CLI.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also heard about the concept of a homelab and doing cool networking things with it (things like setting up a firewall or using the machine as a router), and figured it would be better to experiment on a dedicated machine if I have the chance.</p>
<p>I recently got my hands on a 2017 MacBook Pro, and decided to install Ubuntu on it. The installation itself was pretty smooth...however I couldn&#39;t connect to the WiFi after rebooting.</p>
<p>Based on some initial searching, I think it didn&#39;t install the WiFi driver, which might be causing this.</p>
<p>One of the solutions is to connect an Ethernet cable directly and then install the driver...but my MacBook has no Ethernet port. I&#39;d need to buy an adapter for that, so if anyone has any other ideas let me know!</p>

<p>This week was supposed to be my last week working on this, but most of my time was spent reading CS:APP, so this got pushed to the side. I revisited the project on the weekend, and had another breakthrough in terms of what the end result should look like. Despite this, I was struggling to write actual code.</p>
<p>Since I am working on stuff I&#39;m more excited about now, this is going on the back burner. I might come back to it whenever I find myself feeling stuck again.</p>
