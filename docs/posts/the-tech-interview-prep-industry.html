                    <p>Before I got into tech, I worked at a tutoring company in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., doing a mix of schoolwork-related tutoring and standardized test prep.</p>
<p>From a business perspective, it made so much sense - you have kids taking standardized tests and parents who wanted their kids to do well on them. Here we have the SAT, a measurable evaluation that can be an immediate help to your future if you do well on it (though whether or not it’s truly a good evaluation is well beyond the scope of this essay). For better or for worse, it makes up a non-trivial part of the criteria used to evaluate college applications.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s play economist: if your SAT score allowed you better future prospects, how much would it be worth it to raise it by 100 points? Sure, we’d have to quantify those future prospects and the probabilities, but it generally seems like it would be a good thing. Furthermore, if you could pay someone to help your kid raise their score by 100 points, how much would you pay?</p>
<p>Even if there isn’t a direct value we can calculate for future benefit on SAT score increase, it seems like one of those things that <em>should</em> be true, at least. Talk about easy marketing!  From a business perspective, this seems like the perfect fit; for every graduating student, there’s a new student who will be taking these tests soon enough, frequently with parents that are more than happy to pay for help along the way.</p>
<p>It’s a funny pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>A standardized test is developed</li>
<li>Doing well on that test is beneficial</li>
<li>People are willing to pay for help to do better, especially if it’s for their kids</li>
<li>Businesses pop up to fill that need</li>
</ol>
