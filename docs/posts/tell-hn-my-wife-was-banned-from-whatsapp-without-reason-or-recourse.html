    <h1>Tell HN: My wife was banned from WhatsApp without reason or recourse</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Like many people, my wife and I use WhatsApp to keep in touch with various family and friends who prefer that platform.  I actually use it more than she doesâ€”she basically just chats with close family and a few friends from highschool.<p>A few days ago, she opened the app to find the message,</p><p>&gt; This account is not allowed to use WhatsApp
&gt; Chats are still on this device.</p><p>This didn&#39;t make any sense, as she only uses it to chat with family and friends and certainly hadn&#39;t broken any terms.  Found the option to appeal and submitted that.  A day later, the app now says</p><p>&gt; This account cannot use WhatsApp
&gt; We&#39;ve completed our review and found this account&#39;s activity goes against WhatsApp&#39;s terms of service</p><p>There&#39;s no way she&#39;s actually broken any terms, so it appears this is some kind of mistake, but given the speed of the &#34;review&#34;, I doubt any human has actually looked at it.  She&#39;s tried contacting them via their contact page, but given the review is already &#34;complete&#34;, I&#39;m not too hopeful.</p><p>Our only guess as to what could have caused this is that a week or so before the ban she received a spam message sent to a giant group and marked it as spam.  Perhaps somehow all numbers in that group ended up associated with the spamming?  Regardless, pretty frustrating situation since she has a couple of long-running chats with family and friend groups that she can no longer participate in.  Always fun to be at the whims of the algorithm.</p><p>Posting in case there&#39;s anything to the connection between marking a message as spam and getting blocked (maybe it&#39;s safer to just mute spam messages instead), as well as on the off chance someone from Facebook ends up reading this and can help.</p></div></div>
