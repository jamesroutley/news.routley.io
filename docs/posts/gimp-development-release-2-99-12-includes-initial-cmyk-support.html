    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p><span>GIMP</span> 2.99.12 is a huge milestone towards <span>GIMP</span> 3.0. Many of the missing
pieces are getting together, even though it is still a work in progress.
As usual, issues are expected and in particular in this release which
got important updates in major areas, such as canvas interaction
code, scripts, but also theming…</p>

<h3 id="on-canvas-brush-sizing">On-canvas brush sizing<a href="#on-canvas-brush-sizing" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>There were requests for quickly changing tool settings, such as brush
size or tool opacity, without having to go to the “Tool Options” dockable</p>
<p>A quickly appearing on-canvas <span>GUI</span> was considered (similar to other
software), though we realized that many people who want this prefer a
non workflow-disruptive interaction.</p>
<p>This is why we went for a simpler and direct design. For instance, now
<code>Alt</code> + right click will trigger a brush resize action on canvas.</p>

<p>Note that this code area still is a work-in-progress. There are more
interactions still worked on, such as opacity update and customizability
(see <a href="#customizable-on-canvas-modifiers">next section</a>).</p>
<h3 id="customizable-on-canvas-modifiers">Customizable on-canvas modifiers<a href="#customizable-on-canvas-modifiers" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many features are available on-canvas, some of them less known than
others, for panning, zooming, rotating the canvas (<a href="https://www.gimp.org/release-notes/gimp-2.10.html#digital-painting-improvements">since <span>GIMP</span>
2.10.0</a>)
or even selecting layers through canvas (<a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2019/04/07/gimp-2-10-10-released/#on-canvas-layer-selection">since <span>GIMP</span>
2.10.10</a>).</p>
<p>The current features are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Modifiers</th>
<th>Main button</th>
<th>Secondary button (usually middle click)</th>
<th>Third Button (usually right click)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>-</td>
<td><em>Tool-specific</em></td>
<td>Panning</td>
<td>Contextual menu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Ctrl</code>/<code>Cmd</code></td>
<td><em>Tool-specific</em></td>
<td>Zoom</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Shift</code></td>
<td><em>Tool-specific</em></td>
<td>Canvas rotation</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Shift-Ctrl</code>/<code>Shift-Cmd</code></td>
<td><em>Tool-specific</em></td>
<td>Constrained (15°) canvas rotation</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Alt</code></td>
<td><em>Tool-specific</em></td>
<td>Layer picking</td>
<td>Resize brush (<a href="#on-canvas-brush-sizing">new</a>)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><em>Note: on macOS, <code>Cmd</code> is used in place of <code>Ctrl</code>. This is usually
implied when <code>Ctrl</code> only is mentioned.</em></p>
<p>These are based on the following logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main button is <em>reserved for tools</em>. Even though some of them
  share similar logic (e.g. all the selection tools share modifiers to
  add, subtract or intersect selections), some tools will have specific
  use cases.</li>
<li>The secondary button is used for “navigation”, in particular canvas
  navigation, but even on some kind of <code>z</code> axis with layer navigation
  (recent Layer picking ability since <span>GIMP</span> 2.10.10).</li>
<li>The third button was always reserved for contextual menu only. The new
  <a href="#on-canvas-brush-sizing">brush resizing ability</a> breaks this tradition.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we added new features, it became obvious that we were eventually
going to lack modifiers for other useful actions. Also everyone is
unique and has their own preferred workflow, so some people would
definitely wish to have slightly different action behavior.
As an example, even the <a href="#on-canvas-brush-sizing">just implemented brush
sizing</a> already comes in 2 variants (resize
from center or sides).</p>
<p>Not to mention we had feedbacks of people disliking unexpected canvas
changes, for instance because they hit <code>Shift</code> too early and a canvas
rotation happens (admittedly not everyone cares about having canvas
rotation in their workflow).
Moreover some legacy actions, such as the contextual menu, can be
questionable nowadays (especially as it is the same menu available
at the top of the window).</p>
<p>This is why the canvas interaction code got factorized to use
customizable modifiers rather than hard-coded. The table above is still
the default, but now you may customize it: add more actions and
modifiers, remove some or change them all. The settings are in
<code>Preferences &gt; Canvas Interaction &gt; Modifiers</code>, then click on the button
labelled “<em>Click here to set a button’s modifiers</em>” with any mouse or
stylus button to start customize its modifiers.</p>
<p>You can even add “<em>custom actions</em>“, i.e. anything to which you could
assign a shortcut. Want to swap the foreground/background color on
<code>right click</code>? Now you can. Want to activate the Unified Transform tool
with <code>Shift-middle click</code> and remove canvas rotation? You can too.</p>

</figure>

<p>Not only this, but it should work with any button (not only the second
and third). So if you have a mouse with 20 buttons, you could map every
one of them to an action (as well as any combination with modifiers).</p>
<p>Furthermore it will recognize different input devices, so that you can
map different actions to the same button of several plugged mice or
styli (note that it doesn’t recognize yet different device of the exact
same model, but eventually it probably will).</p>
<p>⚠️  If you experience bugs in any canvas interaction, this is a good time
to report them because a lot of code updates happened to make the code
more generic so early-tester bugs are expected.</p>
<h3 id="testing-new-zoom-behaviors">Testing new Zoom behaviors<a href="#testing-new-zoom-behaviors" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>A new settings is available in <code>Preferences &gt; Canvas Interaction</code> to
customize the zoom behavior, when zooming with <code>Ctrl</code> + middle click or
<code>Ctrl-Space</code>.</p>
<p>The legacy algorithm would zoom, in or out, continuously as long as there is
movement. It doesn’t depend on the movement span, which is why we called
it the “<em>By duration</em>” drag-to-zoom behavior.</p>
<p>The new behavior is the “<em>By distance</em>” drag-to-zoom as it will zoom more
if you do large moves, or in a more fine-grained way with very short
moves. We left both behaviors available as a settings because after user
testing, we decided that some people may prefer the old behavior, though
the newly proposed one also made sense.</p>
<p>Finally the “<em>Drag-to-zoom speed</em>” allows you to set the speed rate at
which the zoom will happen, in percentage of the default (i.e. that 100
is the default speed; you can raise or lower it).</p>
<p>These zoom settings were contributed by woob.</p>
<h3 id="improved-tool-pointers">Improved tool pointers<a href="#improved-tool-pointers" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In <code>Preferences &gt; Input Devices</code>, you will first discover that some
settings have been moved around. In particular, pointer-related settings
have been moved from “Image Windows” to “Input Devices” tab and reorganized.</p>
<p>The second improvement is that the settings behavior have been rethought:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now when “<em>Show brush outline</em>” is checked and “<em>Show pointer for
  paint tools</em>” is unchecked, if the brush outline cannot be drawn (for
  instance because you use a dynamics changing the size with pressure),
  <span>GIMP</span> will display a fallback 4-arcs generic outline showing the set
  size (it used to show a crosshair which made no sense, as “<em>Show
  pointer</em>” was explicitly unchecked).</li>
<li>When both “<em>Show brush outline</em>” and “<em>Show pointer for paint tools</em>”
  are unchecked, we show a minimal visual feedback of a few pixels only,
  as inconspicuous as possible, instead of a crosshair. Once again,
  people are explicitly asking for nothing, so showing a crosshair felt
  counter-productive. Yet actually showing nothing at all would be
  confusing too. Even with tablet displays, the parallax issue is
  unfortunately very real. This is why we opted for an extremely small
  point-like cursor. It still shows your exact position with few disturbance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The point-like cursor was originally contributed by L Amander, then
modified by Aryeom who made it visible on both dark and light
background, and the new pointer was adapted into existing settings
instead of creating a dedicated setting.</p>
<p>⚠️ This point-like cursor feature is really adapted for tablet displays
and may seem very hard to use and frustrating for any other usage
(nearly invisible pointer).</p>

<h3 id="improving-again-the-fill-by-line-art-detection-of-bucket-fill-tool">Improving again the “Fill by line art detection” of Bucket Fill tool<a href="#improving-again-the-fill-by-line-art-detection-of-bucket-fill-tool" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The “Fill by line art detection” mode of the Bucket Fill tool is a big
question for us as we are regularly <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2022/02/25/gimp-2-99-10-released/#new-option-in-line-art-mode-of-bucket-fill-tool">tweaking the
options</a>
to improve usability.</p>
<p>The idea is how to make the settings easier to understand while not
losing the very advanced capacity of the tool.</p>
<p>Therefore we tried something new, reorganizing the options in 3
categories which correspond to the 3 main steps of the line art algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Line Art Detection</strong>: the settings which configure how the line art
   is detected: which source is being used? Using opacity or grayscale?
   Which threshold?</li>
<li><strong>Line Art Closure</strong>: the settings for the closure algorithm of
   opened line art areas.</li>
<li><strong>Fill Borders</strong>: the settings for borders of the fill: how much
   should we grow under the detected line art? How to get nicer borders?</li>
</ol>
<figure>

<figcaption>
<em>3 steps in the line art algorighm: (1) line detection, (2) line closure, (3) border style - <span>GIMP</span> 2.99.12</em>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Also we add an “<em>Automatic closure</em>” checkbox which is equivalent to
setting the “<em>Maximum gap length</em>” to zero, and simply means we don’t
want any smart closure by an algorithm. It is more understandable this
way while making easier to switch between smart and no closure.</p>
<p>As a parallel, the option “<em>Allow closing lines in selected layer</em>” was
renamed “<em>Manual closure in fill layer</em>“.</p>
<p>Finally we added a “<em>Stroke borders</em>” which works similarly as the
“<em>Stroke Path</em>” or “<em>Stroke Selection</em>” features and which can be
useful, in particular for visible borders of unclosed areas.</p>
<p>More iterations may happen to improve usability of this very nice tool
as we progress towards <span>GIMP</span> 3.0.</p>
<h3 id="customizable-checkerboard-colors">Customizable checkerboard colors<a href="#customizable-checkerboard-colors" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In <span>GIMP</span>, we represent transparency in an image through the very common
“checkerboard” pattern. In order to handle various use cases, we were
proposing a series of colors, from light to dark grays, and even
proposing white, gray or black only backgrounds. Though all these had
the shared characteristics of being shades of gray.</p>
<p><code>Preferences &gt; Display &gt; Transparency &gt; Check style</code> has now a new
option “<em>Custom checks</em>” allowing to select any <span>RGB</span> colors for the 2
colors representing “transparency”. If you wish to show transparency
with rainbow 🌈 colors, this is up to you!</p>
<p>The new function <code>gimp_checks_get_colors()</code> has been added to the
interface for plug-ins, replacing <code>gimp_checks_get_shades()</code>. This would
allow any plug-in needing to render transparency checkerboard according
to user choice.</p>
<p>This was originally contributed by Ben Rogalski, then improved, in
particular for proper <span>API</span> and plug-in support.</p>
<h3 id="welcome-dialog">Welcome Dialog<a href="#welcome-dialog" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Remember the “<a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2022/02/25/gimp-2-99-10-released/#welcome-dialog">Welcome
dialog</a>”
which you get after an update (you probably got one in <span>GIMP</span> 2.99.12)? We
worked a bit on the “<em>Release Note</em>” tab to allow for “demo” items. I.e. now
some items (spotted with a different bullet point) will play a short
scenario showing what a new feature refer to.</p>
<p>This is still a work-in-progress which doesn’t work for all types of
features, and the styling for demo “playback” can definitely be
improved. This is what it looks like right now:</p>

<h3 id="pinching-gesture-for-more-usage">Pinching gesture for more usage<a href="#pinching-gesture-for-more-usage" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>It was already possible to <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2021/05/08/gimp-2-99-6-released/#pinch-gesture-on-canvas-for-zooming">zoom the canvas with pinch
gesture</a>
since <span>GIMP</span> 2.99.6.
It is now also possible to rotate the canvas with a pinch gesture. Note
that we made the choice to make zoom and rotation through pinch
exclusive, i.e. that the first detected movement will lock on the
gesture to either zoom or rotation, not both at the same time. It seemed
to us that people might find it annoying to rotate when you just want to
zoom (or the other way around).</p>
<p>Furthermore you can now zoom the preview images in item dockables
(<em>Layers</em>, <em>Channels</em>, <em>Paths</em>) with pinching or mouse wheel.</p>
<p>Finally you can zoom in the <em>Gradients</em> dockable by pinch gesture too.</p>
<p>All of these were contributed by Povilas Kanapickas, who had already
implemented zoom through pinch gesture on canvas.</p>
<h2 id="cmyk"><span>CMYK</span><a href="#cmyk" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This one deserved a section on its own in this news report because
thanks to our new <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2022/06/03/cmyk-in-gsoc-2022/">GSoC
student</a>,
things moved quite fast here, not only for <span>CMYK</span>, but for the color space
invasion project as a whole. We
had to re-think a lot of the color conversions and display in various
parts of the program.</p>
<h3 id="simulation-data-is-now-image-data">Simulation data is now image data<a href="#simulation-data-is-now-image-data" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The main usage of “simulation” is soft-proofing, a very common use case
being printing. E.g. you could work in a <span>RGB</span> space, but know the final
format (e.g. through a profile given to you by a printshop, often a <span>CMYK</span>
profile) and want to see how your image would render, in particular
regarding gamut loss.</p>
<p>It was already possible to set a “<em>Soft proof profile</em>“, as well as a
rendering intent, and whether you wanted black point compensation or
not. Yet this info was lost at each session restart.</p>
<p>These data will now be stored within the <span>XCF</span> file itself. So you won’t
need to re-set them each time. Indeed if you work on a print job, the
final target can be considered part of your workflow for this specific
print job, hence part of the image.</p>
<p>As a consequence, these 3 information (soft proof profile, soft proof
rendering intent and soft proof black point compensation) moved from the
<code>View &gt; Color Management</code> menu to the <code>Image &gt; Color Management</code> menu
(though <code>View &gt; Color management</code> still contains some settings, such as
whether to enable color management and whether or not to soft-proof;
these are not image data but specific to a view: a same image can be
simultaneously displayed in several views, one proofed and the other
not, for instance).</p>
<h3 id="simulation-toggle-in-the-status-bar">Simulation toggle in the status bar<a href="#simulation-toggle-in-the-status-bar" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>To make simulation a first-class citizen in your workflow, we wanted a
way to make it obvious when you are viewing a proofed image or not.
This is done through a new icon at the right of the status bar. This
icon has 3 purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It visually shows whether we are in simulation (a.k.a. soft-proofing)
  mode or not.</li>
<li>It allows to switch from simulation to non-simulated modes by clicking
  on it.</li>
<li>It allows to customize simulation settings (simulation profile,
  simulation rendering intent, black point compensation…) with a pop-up
  dialog by right-clicking.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="various-gui-now-simulation-aware">Various <span>GUI</span> now simulation-aware<a href="#various-gui-now-simulation-aware" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most GUIs which were displaying <span>CMYK</span> data were displaying “naive <span>CMYK</span>”
colors. It is some generic algorithm not taking into account a specific
<span>CMYK</span> color space.</p>
<p>Now if you set a simulation profile, and if this profile is a <span>CMYK</span> one,
then these interface will display <span>CMYK</span> colors for this space, assuming
that this is what you are interested in.</p>
<p>This includes interfaces such as the Color Picker tool, Sample Points,
and the <span>CMYK</span> color selector.</p>
<h3 id="export-formats-with-new-or-improved-cmyk-support">Export formats with new or improved <span>CMYK</span> support<a href="#export-formats-with-new-or-improved-cmyk-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Similarly, several supported image formats have now new or improved <span>CMYK</span>
support. We are not talking about having core <span>CMYK</span> support as backend
encoding; <span>GIMP</span> is still only working in either *<span>RGB</span>, grayscale or
indexed. Yet, you can now better import or export <span>CMYK</span> images in several
formats, with much more suitable conversion done. In particular, it
means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span>CMYK</span> profile of imported <span>CMYK</span> images will be stored as a
  simulation profile. I.e. that the image will now be <span>RGB</span>, yet the <span>CMYK</span>
  profile will be kept for simulation.</li>
<li><span>RGB</span> images can be exported as <span>CMYK</span>, using the simulation profile (if a
  <span>CMYK</span> one) for conversion, then stored in the resulting <span>CMYK</span> file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The assumption is always that the simulation profile is your target
color space.</p>
<p>The updated formats so far are:</p>
<p><strong><span>JPEG</span></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>CMYK</span> export now possible using the image Soft-proofing profile.</li>
<li><span>CMYK</span> import ported to <span>GEGL</span>/babl conversion. The <span>CMYK</span> profile in
     the <span>JPEG</span> image will be stored as soft-proof profile on the image.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span>TIFF</span></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 and 16-bit <span>CMYK</span>(A) export now possible, using the image
     Soft-proofing profile.</li>
<li><span>CMYK</span> import now possible. The <span>CMYK</span> profile in the <span>TIFF</span> image will
     be stored as Soft-proofing profile on the image.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span>PSD</span></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>CMYK</span> import ported to <span>GEGL</span>/babl conversion. The <span>CMYK</span> profile in
     the <span>PSD</span> image will be stored as soft-proof profile on the image.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-plug-in-api">New plug-in <span>API</span><a href="#new-plug-in-api" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Plug-ins can now request or set the soft-proofing profile of an image
with new functions, such as <code>gimp_image_get_simulation_profile()</code> or
<code>gimp_image_set_simulation_profile()</code> respectively. This is really a new
image data which can and should be used by plug-ins when they want to
display or process <span>CMYK</span> colors in the context of the active image.</p>
<p>Similarly several <code>libgimpwidgets</code> widgets (<code>GimpColorNotebook</code>,
<code>GimpColorSelection</code> and <code>GimpColorSelector</code>) became simulation-aware
with new dedicated functions to set the simulation space of interest.</p>
<h2 id="themes">Themes<a href="#themes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p><span>GTK</span> got a new <span>CSS</span>-like theming system in <span>GTK</span>+ 3, which means our 2.10
themes were not reusable and which is why we called for theme designers
many times because a graphics application should really have a good set
of neutral gray themes for an interface with the less color pollution
possible, as it can affect your color perception.</p>
<p>It is only a month ago that we got a first proposal for a mid-gray
neutral theme, though this one is still a work-in-progress. On the other
hand, it triggered our long-term contributor, <a href="https://shallowsky.com/">Akkana
Peck</a>, to propose a Light theme. With quick
back-and-forth exchanges, this one was rapidly completed and merged into
the source tree. Nikc helped also a lot by finding solutions to annoying
bugs where we were stuck.</p>
<p>In the end, we made the theme more generic, making colors into variables
with semantic names, and reused the same style code yet different colors
to make a dark theme.</p>
<p>Instead of having 2 themes, we merged these into a “Default” theme with
both a light and dark variants which will be switched depending on the
“<em>Use dark theme variant if available</em>” checkbox.</p>
<p>For this to work, we also made a new process for theme makers, based on
generic <span>GTK</span> process, which is that your theme can contain a
<code>gimp-dark.css</code> file (additional to the main <code>gimp.css</code>). This secondary
file will be used instead of the first when the “<em>Use dark theme variant
if available</em>” option is checked in Preferences.</p>

<h3 id="psd"><span>PSD</span><a href="#psd" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Additionally to the new <span>CMYK</span> support on import, our <span>PSD</span> support got the
following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved error logging during load.</li>
<li>Added support for extra layer mask: according to the specifications
  the extra mask is used “<em>when both a user mask and a vector mask are
  present</em>“.
  We haven’t seen an example that has the extra mask, so not sure
  which of the masks would appear first.
  For now assuming that the extra mask will be first. The advantage
  of adding this here now, is that we won’t try to add a mask
  channel as a normal channel.</li>
<li>Minimal support of duotone data: on import, a duotone image will
  be imported as grayscale image with an alert and the color
  information will be stored in a parasite; on export, a dialog will
  propose you to re-include the duotone data if the image is still
  grayscale. This allows for a roundtrip in <span>GIMP</span> without losing the
  duotone information.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="svg"><span>SVG</span><a href="#svg" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some valid <span>SVG</span> can fail to import when they contain some huge data (of
various types). This is not a limitation of the parser but a security
limitations, because malicious <span>SVG</span> files can be created on purpose to
consume too much memory.</p>
<p>Nevetheless this can still happen on valid and non-malicious files, as
some users encounter issues with <span>SVG</span> files exported by Sweet Home 3D (a
nice Free Software for drawing interior design plans). Hence when
failure to load a <span>SVG</span> occurs, <span>GIMP</span> will propose to try again with the
security limitation removed.</p>

<p>🛈  Note that <span>GIMP</span> doesn’t have the information whether the load failure
happened because of this specific issue or not, so if the reason was
other, even retrying without security limitation may still fail.</p>
<p>⚠️  Also very <span>IMPORTANT</span>: as explained, this was a safety measure, which
implies that disabling it has security implications. You should only
accept disabling it to load <span>SVG</span> files from trusted sources, as the

<p>The following changes happened in our <span>PNG</span> support:</p>
<ul>
<li>The format does not have any flag for linear <span>RGB</span>, but it can simply
  include a linear profile (or a 1.0 <code>gAMA</code> chunk). Therefore since we
  always attach the profile when importing (or transforming the <code>gAMA</code>
  chunk into a profile), we now always load <span>PNG</span> images as non-linear backend.</li>
<li>When exporting indexed images, a new checkbox “<em>Optimize for smallest
  possible palette size</em>“, if enabled, will export a <span>PNG</span> file with
  lowest bit-depth palette possible (less than an 8-bit palette with 256
  entries, if possible).</li>

<li>1-frame animation now loaded correctly (it’s not really an animation
  yet it should still open!).</li>
<li>Layer names now include the delay in ms.</li>
<li>More robust <span>FLI</span>/<span>FLC</span> loading, double-checking data rather than

</ul>
<h3 id="raw-data">Raw data<a href="#raw-data" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>🛈  We are talking here of “raw data” where you export your pixels as
contiguous or planar data directly, without following a specific file
format, and not <span>RAW</span> file formats as are usually called formats used by
digital cameras (for these, we still prefer to pass through good raw
developer software, such as darktable or RawTherapee).</p>
<p>A big rewriting of the Raw Data dialog (and <span>API</span>) organization happened.</p>
<p>First, it is now possible to export any bit depth as raw data (despite
the higher bit depth support, exporting 16 or 32-bit images used to
still export them 8-bit raw data). This part will also be available in
future stable version <span>GIMP</span> 2.10.34.</p>
<p>And especially all exportable formats can be loaded back, and more. As
it made for a huge list, the way the import dialog used to list formats,
we split settings. Data type (unsigned or signed integer, floating
point), endianness or planar configuration (contiguous or planar) are
now their own settings and code has been generalized to support each and
every combination. The “<em>Pixel format</em>” list is now only about the
layout for various components.</p>

<figcaption>
<em>Raw data import dialog with more settings and much more support formats - <span>GIMP</span> 2.99.12</em>

</figure>

<p>As a consequence <span>GIMP</span> now supports a lot more raw data formats, while
keeping a usable dialog, without showing a never-ending list of formats.</p>
<p>The <span>PDB</span> <span>API</span> for this plug-in has also been improved to follow the same
scheme of separate arguments.</p>
<p>As a last change, the <span>HGT</span> format (supported since the <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2017/12/12/gimp-2-9-8-released/#file-formats">stable version <span>GIMP</span>
2.10.0</a>)
is sharing the same codebase so we used to pop the raw data dialog up.
Nevertheless we have all the relevant information for a properly formed
<span>HGT</span> file, so we now load these directly without dialog (unless we fail
to detect the proper sample spacing).</p>
<h3 id="new-format-wbmp">New format: <span>WBMP</span><a href="#new-format-wbmp" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><span>GIMP</span> now supports loading <abbr title="Wireless Application Protocol

optimized for the legacy <abbr title="Wireless Application

<p>The format itself is probably not really useful for new images, but it
can always be useful to be able to load existing images from older archives.</p>
<p>Note that this is a limited support as it doesn’t support all features
of <span>WBMP</span>, yet hopefully enough to be useful for most use cases.</p>

<h2 id="script-fu">Script-fu<a href="#script-fu" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Lloyd Konneker, our new Script-fu maintainer, really did take his new
responsibility to heart as Script-fu code has not seen such activity for
years now.</p>
<p>A lot of bugs were fixed, more documentation for Script-fu developers
was written, but also huge changes happened.</p>
<h3 id="script-fu-server-now-its-own-plug-in">Script-fu server now its own plug-in<a href="#script-fu-server-now-its-own-plug-in" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Script-fu used to be a very monolithic extension plug-in (i.e. a plug-in
running permanently in background), with all its features in one binary,
which had several drawbacks. One of them is that the Script-fu server
(<code>script-fu-server</code>), which allows to communicate with <span>GIMP</span> remotely,
would also be running in the same process.</p>
<p>It can be considered a security hazard, which is why it was made its own
plug-in, which can be run independently, on request only.</p>
<h3 id="new-separate-interpreter">New separate interpreter<a href="#new-separate-interpreter" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><span>GIMP</span> now installs a <code>gimp-script-fu-interpreter-3.0</code> binary which will
run the Script-fu scripts. It has huge advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Script-fu scripts are finally proper plug-ins. They are installed
  within the <code>plug-ins/</code> folder (not in <code>scripts/</code> anymore), and work
  the same way as other bindings.
  Note that Script-fu is not a GObject-Introspected binding, unlike
  other bindings, and it has its own way to wrap the <span>PDB</span> protocol or
  <code>libgimp*</code> libraries, but other than this, it became now much closer conceptually.</li>
<li>It makes the Script-fu infrastructure much more robust as a single
  crashing script will not crash the whole Script-fu altogether. Every
  Script-fu plug-in now runs in its own dedicated and independant process.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rethinking-the-api">Rethinking the <span>API</span><a href="#rethinking-the-api" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since a lot happened on the main <code>libgimp*</code> <span>API</span>, Script-fu specific <span>API</span>
had not been able to follow up. We are now trying to fill that gap and
to get Script-fu much closer to the main interface.</p>
<p>Among these changes, the new function <code>script-fu-register-filter</code> is
used to declare <span>PDB</span> procedure of the C class <code>GimpImageProcedure</code>. It
will also allow to much more easily use the procedural dialog generation
through the <code>GimpProcedureDialog</code> class.</p>
<p>A lot of discussions also happened on the topic of argument handling for
various types. This is still a work-in-progress as we are trying to
improve some use cases, for instance handling of plug-in’s specific
lists of options.</p>
<h2 id="api"><span>API</span><a href="#api" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Application Programming Interface for plug-in developer received
various improvements and changes within this iteration.</p>
<p>Of course, we have many new functions corresponding to new features in
<span>GIMP</span>, such as for the simulation color management, customizable
checkerboard colors and more. <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/blob/50a1fd6ed33a8e20636d176b5f36064a4df15a08/NEWS#L280">See the
list</a>.</p>
<p>A new <code>gimp_image_metadata_save_filter()</code> also appears, as an
alternative to <code>gimp_image_metadata_save_finish()</code> when you want to save
metadata yourself and you need only filtering processing.
It returns filtered metadata allowing the caller to save the finalized
metadata via other means (via native format’s library for example). This
<span>API</span> can be used to support metadata saving of image formats not directly
supported by gexiv2/exiv2. We already use it for the <span>HEIF</span>/<span>AVIF</span> plug-in.</p>
<p>We also finally got rid of various functions assuming that an image only
had a single active layer or channel. We know this is not true anymore
in <span>GIMP</span> 3.0, with <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/11/06/gimp-2-99-2-released/#multi-layer-selection">multi-item
selection</a>.</p>
<p>Among the many other changes, one of the most important changes in this
updated <span>API</span> is how we handle plug-in localization. While the translation
of most strings were left to the plug-in’s discretion, the strings at
register time (plug-in title, documentation…) were translated by the
core, e.g. when used in menus or in the <span>PDB</span> browser, using gettext
catalog given at registration time. This raised various issues, such as
what happens if several plug-ins were to register a catalog with the
same name (which could have been fixed, with even more complicated
internal logic)? Or what happens if a plug-in doesn’t register a
localization catalog, but the default catalog contains (wrong)
translations for submitted strings? Moreover it ended up to be quite
confusing as many plug-in developers were wondering what is translated
where, i.e. if a string should be surrounded by <code>_()</code> (common gettext
macro) or <code>N_()</code> (noop gettext macro).</p>
<p>So the new logic is much simpler: translation is now left <em>entirely</em> at
the plug-in discretion, i.e. all strings received by the core are
assumed to be in the correct target language. The core doesn’t try to
translate anything coming from plug-ins anymore.</p>
<p>Now to help a bit with localization, our infrastructure proposes a
standard file organization, with all gettext catalogs under the
<code>locale/</code> folder of the plug-in directory, and named the same way as the
plug-in itself. If the catalog is absent, our system outputs a message
on <code>stderr</code> to inform of this standard procedure. A plug-in following
this procedure won’t have anything else to do than place the compiled
gettext catalogs (<code>*.mo</code> files) with the right domain name in the right folder.</p>
<p>A <code>GimpPlugIn</code> can supplant this behavior at any time by overriding the
<code>set_i18n()</code> method, to either disable localization altogether, pointing
to a different catalog path and name or even use another system than gettext.</p>
<p>The only remnant of the old logic, which we need to think about and
improve, is the localization of menu paths, as we still want
core-localization of some base menu paths. E.g. the root menus (“Edit”,
“Image”, “Colors”, “Filters”…) but also some submenus (“Blur”,
“Enhance”, “Distorts”…) should still be localized by the core while
plug-ins will need to handle new parts in the menu path. This is the
only exception to the new “no core translation” logic for plug-in.</p>
<h2 id="batch-processing">Batch processing<a href="#batch-processing" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>A new <code>libgimp</code> class <code>GimpBatchProcedure</code> was added, facilitating the
creation of batch interpreter plug-ins, i.e. plug-ins meant to be run
from command line to process a series of procedure calls. Currently 2
such interpreters exist in <span>GIMP</span>: the Script-fu
(<code>plug-in-script-fu-eval</code>) and the Python (<code>python-fu-eval</code>) interpreters.</p>
<p>Running code this way is done with the <code>--batch</code> <abbr title="Command
Line Interface"><span>CLI</span></abbr> option. Historically Script-fu was used as
default, but this is not the case anymore. Now you must explicitly
specify an interpreter with <code>--batch-interpreter</code>.</p>
<p>Moreover a new option <code>--quit</code> was created and this is what you must use
if you wish to exit <span>GIMP</span> immediately after the scripts are run. Do not
call <code>&#34;(gimp-quit 1)&#34;</code> anymore. A nice improvement is that <span>GIMP</span> will now
exit immediately after a batch failure (i.e. if you had a series of
<code>--batch</code> calls, it will stop at the first failure) and will propagate
the failure into the process exit code.
Exit codes are inspired from command Linux error codes: 0 for success,
69 for service unavailable (e.g. setting a non-existing interpreter
name), 64 for usage (e.g. not specifying any interpreter or calling
errors), 70 for execution errors (bugs in the interpreter plug-in) and
130 for canceling the call. Therefore you will now know when your
scripts fail.</p>
<p>As an example of batch processing, here is how you could load a <span>PNG</span>
image, then export it back as <span>JPEG</span>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ gimp-2.99 --batch-interpreter python-fu-eval -idf -b <span>&#34;img=Gimp.list_images()[0];layers=img.list_layers();c=Gimp.get_pdb().lookup_procedure(&#39;file-jpeg-save&#39;).create_config();c.set_property(&#39;image&#39;,img);c.set_property(&#39;file&#39;,Gio.file_new_for_path(&#39;/home/jehan/out.jpg&#39;));c.set_property(&#39;drawables&#39;,Gimp.ObjectArray.new(Gimp.Drawable, layers, False));c.set_property(&#39;num-drawables&#39;,len(layers));Gimp.get_pdb().run_procedure_config(&#39;file-jpeg-save&#39;,c)&#34;</span> --quit  /home/jehan/in.png
</code></pre></div>

<p>This long command line may seem frightening, but this is the same script
in a file, named for instance <code>gimp-script.py</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>img</span> <span>=</span> <span>Gimp</span><span>.</span><span>list_images</span><span>()[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>

<span>c</span><span>.</span><span>set_property</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;drawables&#39;</span><span>,</span> <span>Gimp</span><span>.</span><span>ObjectArray</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>Gimp</span><span>.</span><span>Drawable</span><span>,</span> <span>layers</span><span>,</span> <span>False</span><span>))</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Run it through <span>GIMP</span> in batch mode like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>gimp-2.99 --batch-interpreter python-fu-eval -idf -b - --quit  /home/jehan/in.png &lt; gimp-script.py
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, you can add in your scripts any filtering or image
manipulation, through <span>GEGL</span> or libgimp <span>API</span>.</p>

<h3 id="meson-message-to-packagers">meson (message to packagers)<a href="#meson-message-to-packagers" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><span>GIMP</span> build system traditionally uses <span>GNU</span> autotools. An initial, yet
incomplete, port to the newer meson system was contributed in 2017 by
Félix Piédallu.</p>
<p>It took a few years to complete the last customizations, tweaking meson
scripts to be able to handle all the special cases we had in <span>GIMP</span> code.
As we approached completion in this development cycle, we started to
officially recommend meson for Windows, then macOS, and finally, early
August, we decided to recommend meson for all platforms.</p>
<p>This is still an evaluation phase for this build system, though now we
are moving forward into intensive testing. <strong>If you are a packager,
please try to now use our meson build and report any issue to us.</strong></p>
<p>Exceptionally for this version, we released 2 tarballs on our <a href="https://download.gimp.org/pub/gimp/v2.99/">download
server</a>:
<code>gimp-2.99.12.tar.xz</code> and <code>gimp-2.99.12-autotools.tar.bz2</code>. As you can
guess, the former is the meson-generated tarball, yet we left an
autotools-generated tarball as fallback if the meson tarball end up
having major issues.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/blob/master/INSTALL.in"><span>INSTALL</span></a>
file was rewritten as well with meson instructions.</p>
<p>Of course, all our own packages (flatpak for Linux, installer for
Windows and <span>DMG</span> for macOS) are now built with meson.</p>
<h3 id="gettext">Gettext<a href="#gettext" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>As many other projects, <span>GIMP</span> was using the <code>intltool</code> project to extract
localizable strings and translate various files with <code>gettext</code>, not only code.</p>
<p>Since about 2016, upstream <code>gettext</code> gained the ability to extract
strings for more types of files and formats, projects were <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/MigratingFromIntltoolToGettext">encouraged
to move on</a> and
the <code>intltool</code> project was progressively abandoned. But <span>GIMP</span> was still
using it for various types of files (<span>XML</span>, desktop files, Inno Setup
translation files and more…) so the workfield was not small.</p>
<p>Well no more as Niels De Graef finally took care of this port and got
rid of this technical debt! 🥳</p>
<p>Of course, it triggered various problems, even to release day as we
realized when testing installers that some buttons were broken (which is
one of the few reasons why this news is out days after the actual source
release) and we had to fix the strings. Hopefully this was the last
related issue!</p>

<p>Wayland issues are slowly yet surely being getting rid of. Some of the
issues we had just disappeared with more recent versions of some Wayland
compositors. We do hope more bugs in upstream compositors will be fixed
eventually because some serious issues are still puzzling us (such as
crashes of some <span>GTK</span> applications, <span>GIMP</span> included, on the <code>Sway</code> Wayland compositor).</p>
<p>Some other issues have been handled in our code.</p>
<p>One of them is that early testers may have noticed a very annoying popup
telling you that “<em>gimp-2.99 wants to inhibit shortcuts</em>” (at least on
<code>Mutter</code>, the Wayland compositor of <span>GNOME</span>) in former 2.99 versions.
This got fixed by removing various keyboard grabbing code which was not
necessary anymore with <span>GTK</span>+3.0.</p>
<p>Some issues still remain, based on the early state of Wayland in
general, in particular because it doesn’t have color management. We were
often advised to use the “portals” for various features, such as color
picking, which unfortunately do not return us color-managed colors (as a
side issue, some desktop — such as Cinnamon and Mate — simply are
missing implementation for the color picking portal even though the
portal exists, which confuses <span>GIMP</span>). This is a <em>regression</em> problem
because we were getting wrong colors (slightly wrong, or even very wrong
if you use a wide gamut display) even when one were still running on
X11. Therefore now we will favour the X11 implementation for color
picking when you are running on X11 and will use the portals only
on Wayland. We may go back to portals for everyone on Linux when they
return managed colors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we are in discussions with Freedesktop portal developers to
get a new color-picking portal <span>API</span>, which will eventually have to be
implemented for the various desktops. Let’s hope it happens sooner
rather than later! 😅</p>
<h3 id="macos">macOS<a href="#macos" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>As usual, a lot of maintenance work was done by <a href="https://medium.com/@lukasco">Lukas
Oberhuber</a>.
Packaging work is not as visible, hence is quite often thankless, which
should be fixed: thanks Lukas as well as every other packager!</p>
<p>Apart from this, you may remember the slowness issues happening on newer
macOS versions (ever since Big Sur). We had some custom patches already
for <span>GTK</span> and some dirty trick in <span>GIMP</span> code itself since <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2022/02/25/gimp-2-99-10-released/#wayland-and-macos-support"><span>GIMP</span>
2.99.10</a>.</p>
<p>It all led to various improvements in <span>GTK</span> code which took over the
previous patches. It took months of testing, several code proposals
in several directions (at least 3 different merge requests, possibly
more code was discarded) and it got to a very satisfying result as Lukas
confirmed it is much faster now and <span>GIMP</span> is totally usable. Our in-<span>GIMP</span>
dirty tricks could also be removed.
For all these improvements, we want to thank in particular John Ralls
who provided the final fixes and Christian Hergert for his constant
inputs. Of course, we should not forget the numerous other contributors
who stopped by to help and give useful inputs. Hopefully <span>GTK</span> on macOS
will continue to improve even more!</p>
<p>In any case, this is great news for all other multi-platform <span>GTK</span>
software, though no <span>GTK</span>+3 release contains these fixes yet. It will be
available in <span>GTK</span>+ 3.24.35.</p>
<p>We include a patch on Cairo (again by John Ralls) as well for improved
performance on macOS, though the gained performance was not as obvious
as the <span>GTK</span> fix.</p>
<p>Also additionally to the development releases, we now provide nightly
builds for macOS. Check the section “<em>Automatic development builds</em>” of
the <a href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/devel/">Development download page</a>
for a procedure.
⚠️ As usual, we remind that nightly builds means that it’s even more
experimental than development builds: these packages happen at random
point in the development process and the builds are not even
human-tested. ☢</p>
<p>In any case, a lot has happened since the days, not so long ago, when we
were <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/12/25/gimp-2-10-22-released-macos/#whats-going-on-with-big-sur">despairing at the sad state of <span>GIMP</span> on
macOS</a>,
with slowness (to the point of being unusable) and interface issues. Now
we are finally getting to a point where we can hope <span>GIMP</span> 3.0 will be
great on macOS, though we are still very short on contributors for this
<span>OS</span>. We welcome any developer wanting to join us!</p>
<p>Last point for people waiting for M1 builds: some work has been done in
this direction, but we are mostly blocked by <span>CI</span> hardware limitations.
We’ll keep you updated on improvements for this topic obviously.</p>
<p>For people who have a M1 Mac and are willing to build locally, there are
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Infrastructure/gimp-macos-build/-/blob/master/scripts/build_gimp3.sh">build scripts</a>,
in the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Infrastructure/gimp-macos-build">gimp-macos-build repository</a>
though starting from the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Infrastructure/gimp-macos-build/-/blob/master/README.md"><span>README</span></a>
might be ideal.
Note that Lukas is already doing all his work on M1 machines now, so
we are just waiting for <span>CI</span> support to provide proper packages.</p>
<h2 id="babl-and-gegl">babl and <span>GEGL</span><a href="#babl-and-gegl" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As usual, this release is supplemented with the releases of
<a href="https://gegl.org/babl/">babl</a> 0.1.94/0.1.96 and
<a href="https://gegl.org/"><span>GEGL</span></a> 0.4.38.</p>
<h3 id="babl-01940196">babl 0.1.94/0.1.96<a href="#babl-01940196" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>babl 0.1.94 fixes a crash on non-aligned data for <span>SIMD</span> and improve vala
compatibility of introspection information.</p>
<p>It also brings a new command line utility for converting unique colors
from one format and/or space to another. This is very useful to us for
testing our color conversions and verifying that <span>GIMP</span> code does the
right conversions too, which is why we wrote this tool in the context of
the color invasion project.</p>
<p>For instance, to convert some color from sRGB to the <span>CIELAB</span> color space:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ babl -f <span>&#34;R&#39;G&#39;B&#39; u8&#34;</span> -t <span>&#39;CIE Lab float&#39;</span> <span>100</span> <span>100</span> <span>100</span>
Converting from <span>&#34;R&#39;G&#39;B&#39; u8&#34;</span> to <span>&#34;CIE Lab float&#34;</span>:
- <span>42</span>.374615
- <span>0</span>.000000
- <span>0</span>.000009
</code></pre></div>

<p>Usage is:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ babl --help
Usage: babl <span>[</span>options<span>]</span> <span>[</span>c1 ..<span>]</span>
Convert color data from a specific Babl format and space to another.

  Options:
     -h, --help            this <span>help</span> information

     -f, --from            input Babl format

     -t, --to              output Babl format

     -i, --input-profile   input profile

     -o, --output-profile  output profile

     -r, --intent          rendering intent
                           it only works with an output profile

     -b, --brief           brief output
                           it can be re-entered as input <span>for</span> chain conversions

All parameters following -- are considered components values. This is useful to input negative components.

The tool expects exactly the number of components expected by your input format.

The default input and output formats are <span>&#34;R&#39;G&#39;B&#39; float&#34;</span> and default space is sRGB <span>for</span> RGB formats, or the naive CMYK space <span>for</span> CMYK formats.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, this tool is still meant to evolve.</p>
<p>Note that babl 0.1.96 is functionally the same as babl 0.1.94, except
for a fix in the build system, which was preventing to build babl from a
tarball. Packagers in particular should therefore use the latest version.</p>
<h3 id="gegl-0438"><span>GEGL</span> 0.4.38<a href="#gegl-0438" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>A new denoising operation called “Denoise <span>DCT</span>” (<code>&#34;denoise-dct&#34;</code>) was
introduced by Thomas Manni. It decomposes the input buffer to sliding
overlapping patches, calculates the <span>DCT</span> denoising in each patch, and
then aggregates the denoised patches to the output buffer averaging the
overlapped pixels.</p>
<p>As for existing operations, the following were improved:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ff-load</code> and <code>ff-save</code>: big <span>API</span> cleanup, now ffmpeg-5.0 compatible.</li>
<li><code>gif-load</code>: updated to latest upstream libnsgif version.</li>
<li><code>slic</code>: progress reporting and improved parameter handling.</li>
<li><code>vector-fill</code>: updated to latest upstream ctx version.</li>
<li><code>oilify</code>: clamp inputs to avoid <code>nan</code> in output.</li>
<li><code>gegl:load</code>: fix possible double free.</li>
<li><code>rgbe-write</code>: plug leaks in error paths.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from bug fixes, other interesting points are that the build
simplified using <span>GEGL</span> as a subproject and the continuous integration has
been rewritten to be more reliable.</p>
<h2 id="team-news">Team news<a href="#team-news" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://film.zemarmot.net/en/#team">Aryeom</a> got reporter access to gimp
and gimp-web to help with various design-related issues.</p>
<p>Daniel Novomeský, maintainer of our <span>JPEG</span>-<span>XL</span> and <span>HEIF</span>/<span>AVIF</span> plug-ins, has
been given access right to our flathub repository (for our stable and
development flatpak) to help with maintenance.</p>
<p>We’d like to thank a category of contributors who are historically not
much in the light: release testers. Recently in particular, as we are
enhancing our <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2021/10/20/gimp-2-99-8-released/#continuous-integration-changes">continuous integration and release
process</a>,
we also try to improve manual verifications before release. Users are
very welcome to discuss with us and hang out on our discussion channels
during release frenzy to test the final builds.</p>
<p>For our Windows installer, additionally to packagers (Jernej Simončič)
and developers (Jacob Boerema), we want to thank
<a href="https://www.deviantart.com/sevenics">Sevenix</a> for having always been
on-call, testing our installers for a few releases now. Sevenix also
helps us to moderate our recent <a href="https://www.gimp.org/discuss.html#discord">Discord discussion
channel</a>.</p>
<p>This is true for the Linux flatpak and the macOS <span>DMG</span> as well, as in
these case, only their packagers (respectively Jehan and Lukas
Oberhuber) have been testing them before release these days. So whatever
is your platform of choice, please join us!</p>
<p>It’s a good reminder that you don’t need to be a developer to contribute
back. There are tasks for designers, packagers, testers, translators,
documenters and more! 🤗</p>
<h2 id="websites">Websites<a href="#websites" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="documentation-website">Documentation website<a href="#documentation-website" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>We regularly write about this here: the <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2021/09/18/gimp-2-10-28-released/#team-news">new
maintainer</a>
of the <code>gimp-help</code> repository (our documentation), <a href="https://www.jacobboerema.nl/en/">Jacob
Boerema</a>, has been improving it for over
a year now, doing much needed maintenance, removing technical debt, and
improving what existed. But you could not see much of it… until today!</p>
<p>Indeed he very recently updated the <a href="https://docs.gimp.org/">online documentation
website</a>. As you can see, from the landing page
already, we finally see all languages, and each of them show their
translation ratio now. We do hope it will trigger more people to help
and contribute to translation! 😸</p>
<p>A daily-update process has also been set up, so that we won’t ever get
back in this bad situation of outdated online documentation for years
(even though some contents were already fixed in-repository).</p>
<p>The Quick Reference <span>PDF</span> is now also available in every supported
language (once again with translation completion percentage showing up).</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of original contents still deserve more love, either
outdated, or information about new features may be missing. There is
just so much that a man alone can do. Yet now the infrastructure is
there to welcome a much faster update and feedback process, so if anyone
wants to contribute to the documentation, you should look at the
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Infrastructure/gimp-web">repository</a> and
propose merge requests. The contribution format is <em>DocBook</em>.</p>
<p>For translation contributions, you should get in touch with <span>GNOME</span>
translation teams as they have their own platform. More information is
available <a href="https://docs.gimp.org/help.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>A dedicated news with more details might soon be published, possibly if
we decide to make a new tagged release of the manual, which will mean
new installers for Windows, and tarballs for other platforms and for
packagers, containing up-to-date contents for offline usage.</p>
<h3 id="development-website">Development website<a href="#development-website" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Meanwhile our <a href="https://developer.gimp.org/">developer website</a> was in an
even more dire situation as it had not been updated for over 10 years!</p>
<p>This is about to change as one of our goals for <span>GIMP</span> 3.0 is to improve
the plug-in ecosystem, not only with an upcoming <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/11/06/gimp-2-99-2-released/#extensions">extension
platform</a>,
but also with better and more up-to-date documentation.</p>
<p>The work on the new developer website is finally starting, thanks to the
impulsion by Robin Swift, a new contributor, and help from Pat David
(who is the long-time contributor who already helped by <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2015/11/22/20-years-of-gimp-release-of-gimp-2816/#new-website">revamping our
website</a>
and created the <a href="https://pixls.us/"><span>PIXLS</span>.<span>US</span> community</a> for <span>FLOSS</span>
photography tool).</p>
<p>We already ported the website contents, away from DocBook, to the
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> platform. This should simplify contributions.
We also cleaned most of the outdated contents and started to port some
contents which were stored in the source repository itself and from the wiki.</p>
<p>Ah, the wiki! Some people might have noticed that it is gone now. We
used to have the roadmap, build instructions for newcomers and more
technical or historical stuff over there. Let’s say that unfortunate
events occurred and we lost it. 😱</p>
<p>Fortunately all the contents could be salvaged, and we plan to port the
valuable parts into the upcoming developer website, nicely
organized.
After all, both the wiki and the developer website were filling a
similar purpose (with the exception that one was mostly abandoned). So
in the end, it’s a good thing, organization wise, right? 😅).</p>
<p>It’s still very early in the migration process, so we will keep you
up-to-date with more exciting news soon.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next<a href="#whats-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This release is once again a major milestone towards <span>GIMP</span> 3.0. All 2.99
development versions were big milestones, but we are really feeling we
are getting close to release candidates now, with some great improvements
happening in much needed places:</p>
<ul>
<li>we are finally getting proper neutral-gray themes;</li>
<li>our Wayland build is finally getting a bit stabler (even though issues remain);</li>
<li>our macOS build is really on the usable side now;</li>
<li>our last remaining <span>GTK</span> port issues are slowly, but very surely,
  getting taken care care of;</li>
<li>the space invasion project is showing leaps thanks to the <span>CMYK</span> project
  (which forces us to review color space issues as a whole);</li>
<li>Script-fu and the <span>API</span> in general are getting much love;</li>
<li>several of our long-worked improvement projects are getting to an end;</li>
<li>and more as so many things are on the work!</li>
