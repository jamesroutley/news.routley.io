It was brilliant,” she later said of her protest. “But it was very traumatising,” she added. “It was open season on treating me like a crazy bitch.”</p><p>The year before that high-profile protest, she boycotted the Grammy Awards, the music industry’s answer to the Oscars, saying she did not want “to be part of a world that measures artistic ability by material success.”</p><p>She refused the playing of US national anthem before her concerts, drawing further public scorn.</p><p>In more recent years, O’Connor became better known for her spiritualism and activism, and spoke publicly about her mental health struggles.</p><p>In 2007, Ms O’Connor told US talk show Oprah Winfrey that she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder four years previously and that before her diagnosis she had struggled with thoughts of suicide and overwhelming fear.</p><p>She said at the time that medication had helped her find more balance, but “it’s a work in progress”.</p><p>Ms O’Connor had also voiced support for other young women performers facing intense public scrutiny, including Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus.</p><p>The singer converted to Islam in 2018 and changed her name to Shuhada Sadaqat, though continued to perform under the name Sinéad O’Connor. In <a href="https://soundcloud.com/irishtimes-women/ep-504-nothing-compares-sinead-oconnors-rememberings" target="_blank">2021, Ms O’Connor released a memoir Rememberings</a>, while last year a film on her life was directed by Kathryn Ferguson.</p><p>Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick was among those who have offered his condolences on social media.</p><p>“The amazing Sinéad O’Connor has passed away and I’m so sad for her and all her loved ones,” he said.</p><p>“I was so damn lucky to have spent time with her and to have worked with such an extraordinary talented woman.”</p><p>Colm O’Gorman, executive director of Amnesty International Ireland, said: “It is hard to think of an artist who has had the social and cultural impact of Sinead. What a loss. Heartfelt condolences to her children, her family and all who loved her.”</p></article></div>
