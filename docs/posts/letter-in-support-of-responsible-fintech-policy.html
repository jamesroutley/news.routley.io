      <p>
      The Honorable Charles E. Schumer</p>

      <p>Dear U.S. Congressional Leadership, Committee Chairs and Ranking Members,</p>

      <p>
      We are 1500 computer scientists, software engineers, and technologists who
      have spent decades working in these fields producing innovative and
      effective products for a variety of applications in the fields of database
      technology, open-source software, cryptography, and financial technology
      applications.
      </p>

      <p>
      Today, we write to you urging you to take a critical, skeptical approach
      toward industry claims that crypto-assets (sometimes called
      cryptocurrencies, crypto tokens, or web3) are an innovative technology
      that is unreservedly good. We urge you to resist pressure from digital
      asset industry financiers, lobbyists, and boosters to create a regulatory
      safe haven for these risky, flawed, and unproven digital financial
      instruments and to instead take an approach that protects the public
      interest and ensures technology is deployed in genuine service to the
      needs of ordinary citizens.
      </p>

      <p>
      We strongly disagree with the narrative — peddled by those with a financial
      stake in the crypto-asset industry — that these technologies represent a
      positive financial innovation and are in any way suited to solving the
      financial problems facing ordinary Americans.
      </p>

      <p>
      Not all innovation is unqualifiedly good; not everything that we can build
      should be built. The history of technology is full of dead ends, false
      starts, and wrong turns. Append-only digital ledgers are not a new
      innovation. They have been known and used since 1980 for rather limited
      functions.
      </p>

      <p>
      As software engineers and technologists with deep expertise in our fields,
      we dispute the claims made in recent years about the novelty and potential
      of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology cannot, and will not, have
      transaction reversal mechanisms because they are antithetical to its base
      design. Similarly, most public blockchain-based financial products are a
      disaster for financial privacy; the exceptions are a handful of emerging
      privacy-focused blockchain finance alternatives, and these are a gift to
      money-launderers. Financial technologies that serve the public must always
      have mechanisms for fraud mitigation and allow a human-in-the-loop to
      reverse transactions; blockchain permits neither.
      </p>

      <p>
      By its very design, blockchain technology, specifically so-called &#34;public
      blockchains&#34;, are poorly suited for just about every purpose currently
      touted as a present or potential source of public benefit. From its
      inception, this technology has been a solution in search of a problem and
      has now latched onto concepts such as financial inclusion and data
      transparency to justify its existence, despite far better solutions
      already in use. After more than thirteen years of development, it has
      severe limitations and design flaws that preclude almost all applications
      that deal with public customer data and regulated financial transactions
      and are not an improvement on existing non-blockchain solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
      Finally, blockchain technologies facilitate few, if any, real-economy
      uses. On the other hand, the underlying crypto-assets have been the
      vehicle for unsound and highly volatile speculative investment schemes
      that are being actively promoted to retail investors who may be unable to
      understand their nature and risk. Other significant externalities include
      threats to national security through money laundering and ransomware
      attacks, financial stability risks from high price volatility, speculation
      and susceptibility to run risk, massive climate emissions from the
      proof-of-work technology utilized by some of the most widely traded
      crypto-assets, and investor risk from large scale scams and other criminal
      financial activity.
      </p>

      <p>
      We implore you to take a truly responsible approach to technological
      innovation and ensure that individuals in the US and elsewhere are not
      left vulnerable to predatory finance, fraud, and systemic economic risks
      in the name of technological potential which does not exist.
      </p>

      <p>
      The catastrophes and externalities related to blockchain technologies and
      crypto-asset investments are neither isolated nor are they growing pains
      of a nascent technology. They are the inevitable outcomes of a technology
      that is not built for purpose and will remain forever unsuitable as a
      foundation for large-scale economic activity.
      </p>

      <p>
      Given these vast externalities, together with the-at best still-ambiguous
      and at worst non-existent-uses of blockchain, we recommend that the
      Committee look beyond the hype and bluster of the crypto industry and
      understand not only its inherent flaws and extraordinary defects but also
      the litany of technological fallacies it is built upon.
      </p>

      <p>
      We need to act now to protect investors and the global financial
      marketplace from the severe risks posed by crypto-assets and must not be
      distracted by technical obfuscations which mask an abject lack of
      technological utility. We thank you for your leadership on financial
      technology and regulation and urge you to consider our objective and
      independent expert judgments to guide your legislative priorities, which
      we remain happy to discuss anytime.
      </p>
