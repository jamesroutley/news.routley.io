This group of eighteen small islands receives the least amount of sunshine in the world per year. Constant rain and heavy winds have always battered these lands.</span></p>

    <div><div id="sm-page-widget-DvtLncQq"><div><p><span>Situated between Iceland, Norway and Scotland, the Faroes face the brunt of the North Atlantic weather system. Constant storms and crashing waves have sculpted the volcanic rock over millions of years into some of the most jaw-dropping (and vertigo-inducing) coastlines on Earth. These towering basalt cliffs can reach heights of over 400 meters, dropping straight into churning seas below.</span></p><p><span>The weather here is unpredictable, and changes faster than you can put your raincoat on—one minute you&#39;re in thick fog, the next you&#39;re hit with winds and piercing rain that&#39;ll knock you sideways, then suddenly the clouds part to reveal views that&#39;ll make your camera work overtime.  </span></p></div>

    <div><div id="sm-page-widget-mdKkMwZT"><div><p><span>Meet the true locals of the Faroes. These wooly sheep have been roaming the islands for over a thousand years, and they outnumber people on the islands. They couldn&#39;t care less about your hiking plans and will casually block paths or graze on the edge of 200-meter cliffs like it&#39;s the most natural thing in the world.</span></p><p><span> Unlike their farm-bound cousins elsewhere, Faroese sheep roam completely free across the islands, somehow always managing to find the most photogenic spots for an impromptu rest. </span><span>This fellow right  here is the only one that gave me any sort of attention. Otherwise, they are all busy grazing on all the grass they could ever ask for.</span></p></div>

They act as insulation, and the thick roots are an excellent waterproof seal against the weather.</span></p></div>

    <div><div id="sm-page-widget-fT4VKqFs"><div><p><span>On the northern tip of Kalsoy lies the Kallur lighthouse. Like most regions on the islands, the land is privately owned. Hiking usually incurs a modest fee paid at the trailhead to the land owners, and the rest is up to you. Trails are just sheep paths, worn smooth by countless hooves over years rather than any official trail maintenance.</span></p><p><span>There are no guardrails, no warning signs, and definitely no liability waivers - just you, the weather, and whatever route the sheep decided made sense. The approach to Kallur is particularly gnarly, following a knife-edge ridge with steep drops on both sides before reaching the lighthouse perched dramatically on sea cliffs. </span></p></div>
