    <h1>Show HN: Repaint â€“ a WebGL based website builder</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="e_1446"><div id="e_1450"><p id="e_1451">Why another website builder?</p><p id="e_1452">We think there&#39;s an obvious hole in the market. It&#39;s becoming standard to design websites in a design tool, then rebuild it in a website builder. That means duplicate work, learning two tools, design-to-code translation... it&#39;s a pain. But existing website builders are miles behind the UX of Figma, and Figma can&#39;t make real websites. If it was all in one tool, it would be SO much easier. That&#39;s the concept behind Repaint. It&#39;s a design tool for real code.</p></div><div id="e_1456"><p id="e_1457">How does Repaint handle responsiveness?</p><p id="e_1458">First you design your website for desktop. Then you make adjustments on different breakpoints. In design terms, Repaint uses autolayout and breakpoints. In code terms, we use flexbox and media queries. We&#39;ve closely followed html and css. We even have responsive units. If you&#39;re unfamiliar with responsive design, our template library has lots of examples.</p></div><div id="e_1453"><p id="e_1454">Can I import from Figma?</p><p id="e_1455">We don&#39;t support importing designs from Figma. We&#39;ve thought about it. We&#39;ve heard a lot of horror stories about export plugins. At best, its low on our todo list. But if you&#39;re familiar with Figma, Repaint will probably be easier than other tools, even if they have a plugin.</p></div><div id="e_1459"><p id="e_1460">Is this made for beginners or professionals web designers?</p><p id="e_1461">Repaint is made for a range of semi-technical people: designers, developers, founders... It&#39;s definitely more technical  than the average person off the street. But you don&#39;t have to be a full-time web dev.</p></div></div></div>
