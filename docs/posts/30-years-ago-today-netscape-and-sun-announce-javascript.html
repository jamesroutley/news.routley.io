MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (December 4, 1995) -- Netscape Communications
Corporation (NASDAQ: NSCP) and Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:SUNW), today
announced JavaScript, an open, cross-platform object scripting language
for the creation and customization of applications on enterprise networks
and the Internet.  The JavaScript language complements Java, Sun&#39;s
industry-leading object-oriented, cross-platform programming language.  The
initial version of JavaScript is available now as part of the beta version
of Netscape Navigator 2.0, which is currently available for downloading
from Netscape&#39;s web site.
</p><p>
In addition, 28 industry-leading companies, including America Online, Inc.,
Apple Computer, Inc., Architext Software, Attachmate Corporation, AT&amp;T;,
Borland International, Brio Technology, Inc., Computer Associates, Inc.,
Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Company, Iconovex
Corporation, Illustra Information Technologies, Inc., Informix Software,
Inc., Intuit, Inc., Macromedia, Metrowerks, Inc., Novell, Inc., Oracle
Corporation, Paper Software, Inc., Precept Software, Inc., RAD
Technologies, Inc., The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc., Silicon Graphics, Inc.,
Spider Technologies, Sybase, Inc., Toshiba Corporation, Verity, Inc., and
Vermeer Technologies, Inc., have endorsed JavaScript as an open
standard object scripting language and intend to provide it in future products.  The draft
specification of JavaScript, as well as the final draft specification of
Java, is planned for publishing and submission to appropriate standards
bodies for industry review and comment this month.
</p><p>
JavaScript is an easy-to-use object scripting language designed for
creating live online applications that link together objects and resources
on both clients and servers.  While Java is used by programmers to create
new objects and applets, JavaScript is designed for use by HTML page
authors and enterprise application developers to dynamically script the
behavior of objects running on either the client or the server.  JavaScript
is analogous to Visual Basic in that it can be used by people with little
or no programming experience to quickly construct complex applications.
JavaScript&#39;s design represents the next generation of software designed
specifically for the Internet and is:
</p><ul>
        <li>  designed for creating network-centric applications
        </li><li>  complementary to and integrated with Java
        </li><li>  complementary to and integrated with HTML
        </li><li>  open and cross-platform.
</li></ul>
Java, developed by Sun, is an object-oriented programming language that
operates independent of any operating system or microprocessor.  Java
programs called applets can be transmitted over a network and run on any
client, providing the multimedia richness of a CD-ROM over corporate
networks and the Internet.  Java has been widely hailed by programmers
because it eliminates the need to port applications, and by managers of
information systems for its potential to lower the costs of distributing
and maintaining applications across the network.

<p>
With JavaScript, an HTML page might contain an intelligent form that
performs loan payment or currency exchange calculations right on the client
in response to user input. A multimedia weather forecast applet written in
Java can be scripted by JavaScript to display appropriate images and sounds
based on the current weather readings in a region.  A server-side
JavaScript script might pull data out of a relational database and format
it in HTML on the fly.  A page might contain JavaScript scripts that run on
both the client and the server.  On the server, the scripts might
dynamically compose and format HTML content based on user preferences
stored in a relational database, and on the client, the scripts would glue
together an assortment of Java applets and HTML form elements into a live
interactive user interface for specifying a net-wide search for
information.
</p><p>
Java programs and JavaScript scripts are designed to run on both clients
and servers, with JavaScript scripts used to modify the properties and
behavior of Java objects, so the range of live online applications that
dynamically present information to and interact with users over enterprise
networks or the Internet is virtually unlimited.  Netscape will support
Java and JavaScript in client and server products as well as programming
tools and applications to make this vision a reality.
</p><p>
&#34;Programmers have been overwhelmingly enthusiastic about Java because it
was designed from the ground up for the Internet.  JavaScript is a natural
fit, since it&#39;s also designed for the Internet and Unicode-based worldwide
use,&#34; said Bill Joy, co-founder and vice president of research at Sun.
&#34;JavaScript will be the most effective method to connect HTML-based content
to Java applets.&#34;
</p><p>
Netscape&#39;s authoring and application development tools  -- Netscape
Navigator Gold 2.0, Netscape LiveWire and Netscape LiveWire Pro  -- are
designed for rapid development and deployment of JavaScript applications.
Netscape Navigator Gold 2.0 enables developers to create and edit
JavaScript scripts, while Netscape LiveWire enables JavaScript programs to
be installed, run and managed on Netscape servers, both within the
enterprise and across the Internet.  Netscape LiveWire Pro adds support for
JavaScript
connectivity to high-performance relational databases from Illustra,
Informix, Microsoft, Oracle and Sybase.  Java and JavaScript support are
being built into all Netscape products to provide a unified, front-to-back,
client/server/tool environment for building and deploying live online
applications.
</p><p>
Java is available to developers free of charge.  The Java Compiler and Java
Developer&#39;s Kit as well as the HotJava browser and related documentation
are available from Sun&#39;s web site at http://java.sun.com.  In addition, the
Java source code can be licensed for a fee.  Details on licensing are also
available via the java.sun.com web page.  To date, Sun has licensed Java to
a number of leading technology companies, including Borland, Macromedia,
Mitsubishi, Netscape, Oracle, Silicon Graphics, Spyglass, and Toshiba.
Sun&#39;s Workshop for Java toolkit is scheduled for release in Spring 1996.
Sun&#39;s NEO product family, the first complete development, operating and
management environment for object-oriented networked applications, will
also use Java-enabled browsers as front-ends to the NEO environment.
</p><p>
Netscape and Sun plan to propose JavaScript to the W3 Consortium (W3C) and
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an open Internet scripting
language standard. JavaScript will be an open, freely licensed proposed
standard available to the entire Internet community.  Existing Sun Java
licensees will receive a license to JavaScript.  In addition, Sun and
Netscape intend to make a source code reference implementation of
JavaScript available for royalty-free licensing, further encouraging its
adoption as a standard in a wide variety of products.
</p><p>
Netscape Communications Corporation is a premier provider of open software
for linking people and information over enterprise networks and the
