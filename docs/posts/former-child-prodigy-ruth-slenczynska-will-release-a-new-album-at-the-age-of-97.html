You&#39;re not a baby. You&#39;re a musician. Stay away from those kids and their stupid games. It&#39;s all a waste of time! You&#39;ve got to act like a grown-up young lady.&#39;&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Southern Illinois University</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Slenczynska went on to become a respected teacher and mentor</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After rejecting her concert career, she cut off her father completely, enrolled for a psychology degree at the University of California and eloped with a fellow student. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But she never stopped playing, and re-emerged on the concert stage in 1951, with a performance at the Carmel Bach Festival.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Thereafter, she toured with the Boston Pops orchestra for four years, enjoying an on-stage rivalry with conductor Arthur Fiedler.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;At first, Mr Fiedler got standing ovations, and I didn&#39;t,&#34; she told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1999. &#34;By the third year, I started getting them, too. I learned how to manage an audience, how to let them know you&#39;re glad to be there.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Finally, there was a concert in Chicago where a critic praised Slenczynska at Fiedler&#39;s expense, writing: &#34;You don&#39;t serve champagne and beer together.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;After that, I was not renewed,&#34; she later remarked. &#34;There was room for only one star on that tour.&#34;</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="subheadline-26"><span role="text">&#39;Sustained excellence&#39;</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Undeterred, she went on to record 10 sparkling LPs for Decca, showcasing her sense of drama and rhythmic control, especially when playing her speciality - the works of Chopin.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In 1961, she wrote a textbook - Music at Your Fingertips: Aspects of Pianoforte Technique - which remains in print, and later joined the Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, first as an artist-in-residence, then as a faculty member. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>To this day she remains a fluid and lyrical player - and, during the first Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, uploaded home recordings of Beethoven&#39;s Sonatas to YouTube, to celebrate his 250th anniversary.</p></div><figure><div><div data-component="social-embed-block"><p><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iZBYEaJEOCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><figcaption><span>Figure caption, </span><p>Warning: Third party content may contain adverts</p></figcaption></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>Slenczynska will also celebrate her 97th birthday with a recital at Lebanon Valley College, Pennsylvania, on 6 February</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s remarkable to think that Ruth made her concert debut before the birth of colour movies, and around the same time as the birth of television,&#34; said Laura Monks and Tom Lewis, co-presidents of the Decca Label Group.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The fact that she is still at the top of her game over nine decades later is extraordinary. It&#39;s very hard to think of anyone, in any profession, who has achieved such a sustained period of excellence.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Label director of Decca Classics, Dominic Fyfe, added: &#34;We are privileged to have Ruth record for Decca again, some 66 years since she first recorded for the label in New York.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;One of her earliest producers was Thomas Frost and we were delighted to unite her with Thomas&#39;s son David, the multi Grammy award-winning producer, for this new album.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><i>Follow us on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCEntsNews/">Facebook</a><i>, or on Twitter </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNewsEnts">@BBCNewsEnts</a><i>.
