  <p><em>Hello readers! This premium edition features a generous free intro because I like to try and get some of the info out there, but the real indepth stuff is below the cut.</em> <em>Nevertheless, I deeply appreciate anyone subscribing.</em></p><hr/><p>One of the only consistent critiques of my work is that I’m angry, irate, that I am taking myself too seriously, that I’m swearing too much, and that my arguments would be “better received” if I “calmed down.”</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>Look at where being timid or deferential has got us. <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/openai-broadcom-to-co-develop-10gw-of-custom-ai-chips?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Broadcom and OpenAI have announced another 10GW of custom chips and supposed capacity</u></a> which will supposedly get fully deployed by the end of 2029, and still the media neutrally reports these things as not simply doable, <em>but rational.</em></p><p>To be clear, building a gigawatt of data center capacity <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-onetrillion/#it-takes-25-years-and-325-billion-per-gigawatt-of-data-center-compute"><u>costs at least $32.5 billion</u></a> (though <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7cee5e77-2618-4ed4-b600-aee22238d07a?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Jensen Huang says the computing hardware alone costs $50 billion</u></a>, which excludes the buildings themselves and the supporting power infrastructure, and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-jensen-math-50-billion-033104538.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANHIkgwv5Z0GjXxI0M8u_0IWzeOe5OfeapTZH47PmwIop8Cj9dW9C2QeLeq4KjkkmF9NTKvFjXShbeuaIqEEY4ATN7JPamaGTPF-7Fx8OZVhTxbR1yzBNDXkmA8YfuURWvYP-BQ-AGwWuUYXotxNXekUPSUq2RrN9-7tSF5Ts1TZ&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Barclays Bank says $50 billion to $60 billion</u></a>) and takes two and a half years. </p><blockquote>In fact, fuck it — I’m updating my priors. Let’s say it’s a nice, round $50 billion per gigawatt of data center capacity. $32.5 billion is what it cost to build Stargate Abilene, but that estimate was based on <a href="https://www.crusoe.ai/resources/newsroom/crusoe-blue-owl-capital-and-primary-digital-infrastructure-enter-joint-venture?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Crusoe’s 1.2GW of compute for OpenAI being part of a $15 billion joint venture</u></a>, which meant a gigawatt of compute runs about $12.5 billion, and Abilene’s 8 buildings are meant to hold 50,000 NVIDIA GB200 GPUs and their associated networking infrastructure, so let’s say a gigawatt is around 333,333 Blackwell GPUs at $60,000 a piece, so about $20 billion a gigawatt. </blockquote><p>OpenAI has now promised 33GW of capacity across <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/openai-amd-chip-deal-ai.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>AMD</u></a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/altman-huang-negotiations-that-sealed-100-billion-openai-nvidia-deal.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>NVIDIA</u></a>, Broadcom and <a href="https://openai.com/index/five-new-stargate-sites/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>the seven data centers built under Stargate</u></a>, though one of those — in Lordstown, Ohio — is not actually a data center, with my source being “SoftBank,” <a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/lordstown-news/more-details-drill-down-lordstowns-role-in-ai-project/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>speaking to WKBN in Lordstown Ohio</u></a>, which said it will “not be a full-blown data center,” and instead be “at the center of cutting-edge technology that will encompass storage containers that will hold the infrastructure for AI and data storage.”</p><p>This wasn’t hard to find, by the way! I googled “SoftBank Lordstown” and up it came, ready for me to read with my eyes.</p><p>Putting all of that aside, I think it’s time that everybody started taking this situation far more seriously, by which I mean acknowledging the sheer recklessness and naked market manipulation taking place. </p><p>But let’s make it really simple, and write out what’s meant to happen in the next year:</p><ul><li><a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-broadcom-announce-strategic-collaboration/?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Broadcom%20to%20deploy%20racks%20of%20AI%20accelerator%20and%20network%20systems%20targeted%20to%20start%20in%20the%20second%20half%20of%202026%2C%20to%20complete%20by%20end%20of%202029"><strong><u>In the second half of 2026</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong>OpenAI and Broadcom will tape out and successfully complete an AI inference chip, then manufacture enough of them to fill a 1GW data center.<ul><li>That data center will be built in an as-yet-unknown location, and will have at least 1GW of power, but more realistically it will need 1.2GW to 1.3GW of power, because for every 1GW of IT load, you need extra power capacity in reserve for the hottest day of the year, when the cooling system works hardest and power transmission losses are highest. . </li><li>OpenAI does not appear to have a site for this data center, and thus has not broken ground on it.</li></ul></li><li><strong>In the second half of 2026, </strong>AMD and OpenAI will begin “<a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1260/amd-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deploy-6-gigawatts-of-amd-gpus?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=The%20first%201%20gigawatt%20deployment%20of%20AMD%20Instinct%20MI450%20GPUs%20is%20set%20to%20begin%20in%20the%20second%20half%20of%202026"><u>the first 1 gigawatt deployment of AMD Instinct MI450 GPUs</u></a>.” <ul><li>This will take place in an as-yet-unnamed data center location, which to be completed by that time would have needed to start construction and early procurement of power at least a year ago, if not more. </li></ul></li><li><strong>In the second half of 2026, </strong><a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/openai-and-nvidia-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deploy-10gw-of-nvidia-systems?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=The%20first%20gigawatt%20of%20NVIDIA%20systems%20will%20be%20deployed%20in%20the%20second%20half%20of%202026%20on%20the%20NVIDIA%20Vera%20Rubin%20platform."><u>OpenAI and NVIDIA will deploy the first gigawatt of NVIDIA’s Vera Rubin GPU systems</u></a> as part of their $100 billion deal.<ul><li>These GPUs will be deployed in a data center of some sort, which remains unnamed, but for them to meet this timeline they will need to have started construction at least a year ago.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In my most conservative estimate, these data centers will cost over $100 billion, and to be clear, a lot of that money needs to already be in OpenAI’s hands to get the data centers built. Or, some other dupe has to a.) have the money, and b.) be willing to front it. </p><p>All of this is a fucking joke. I’m sorry, I know some of you will read this, cowering from your screen like a B-movie vampire that just saw a crucifix, but it is a joke, and it is a fucking stupid joke, the only thing stupider being that any number of respectable media outlets are saying these things like they’ll actually happen.</p><p>There is not enough time to build these things. If there was enough time, there wouldn’t be enough money. If there was enough money, there wouldn’t be enough transformers, electrical-grade steel, or specialised talent to run the power to the data centers. Fuck! Piss! Shit! Swearing doesn’t change the fact that I’m right — none of what OpenAI, NVIDIA, Broadcom, and AMD are saying is possible, and it’s fair to ask why they’re saying it.</p><p>I mean, we know. Number must go up, deal must go through, and Jensen Huang wouldn’t go on CNBC and say “yeah man if I’m honest I’ve got no fucking clue how Sam Altman is going to pay me, other than with the $10 billion I’m handing him in a month. Anyway, <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/receivables-total?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>NVIDIA’s accounts receivables keep increasing every quarter</u></a> <a href="https://selftaughtmba.substack.com/p/does-nvidia-have-an-accounts-receivable?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>for a normal reason</u></a>, don’t worry about it.” </p><p>But in all seriousness, we now have three publicly-traded tech firms that have all agreed to join Sam Altman’s No IT Loads Refused Cash Dump, all promising to do things on insane timelines that they — as executives of giant hardware manufacturers, or human beings with warm bodies and pulses and sciatica — all must know are impossible to meet. </p><p>What is the media meant to do? What are we, as regular people, meant to do? These stocks keep pumping based on completely nonsensical ideas, and we’re all meant to sit around pretending things are normal and good. They’re not! At some point somebody’s going to start paying people actual, real dollars at a scale that OpenAI has never truly had to reckon with.</p><p>In this piece, I’m going to spell out in no uncertain terms exactly what OpenAI has to do in the next year to fulfil its destiny — having a bunch of capacity that cost ungodly amounts of money to serve demand that never arrives.</p><p>Yes, yes, I know, you’re going to tell me that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-users/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>OpenAI has 800 million weekly active users</u></a>, and putting aside the fact that OpenAI’s own research (<a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w34255/w34255.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>see page 10, footnote 20</u></a>) says it double-counts users who are logged out if they’re use different devices, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sam-altman-wants-250-gigawatts-power-possible?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>OpenAI is saying it wants to build 250 gigawatts of capacity</u></a> by 2033, which will cost it $10 <em>trillion dollars, </em>or one-third of the entire US economy last year<em>.</em></p><p>Who the fuck for? </p><p>One thing that’s important to note: In February, <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Goldman Sachs estimated that the global data center capacity was around 55GW</u></a>. In essence, OpenAI says it wants to add <em>five times that capacity</em> — something that has grown organically over the past thirty or so years — by itself, and in eight years. </p><p>And yes, it’ll cost one-third of America’s output in 2024. This is not a sensible proposition. </p><p>Even if you think that OpenAI’s growth is impressive — it went from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/openai-chatgpt-700-million-users.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>700 million</u></a> to 800 million weekly active users in the last two months — that is not the kind of growth that says “build capacity assuming that literally every single human being on Earth uses this all the time.” </p><blockquote><strong>As an aside: </strong>Altman is <em>already lying</em> about his available capacity. <a href="https://sources.news/p/openai-ads-leader-sam-altman-memo-stargate?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>According to an internal Slack note seen by Alex Heath of Sources</u></a>, Altman claims that OpenAI started the year with “around” 230 megawatts of capacity and is “now on track to exit 2025 north of 2GW of operational capacity.” Unless I’m much mistaken OpenAI doesn’t have <em>any</em> capacity of its own — and according to Mr. Altman, it’s somehow <em>built or acquired 1.7GW of capacity from somewhere without disclosing it. </em></blockquote><p>Anyway, what exactly is OpenAI doing? Why does it need all this capacity? Even if it  hits its $13 billion revenue projection for this year (<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/sora2-openai/"><u>it’s only at $5.3 billion or so as of the end of August, and for OpenAI to hit its targets it’ll need to make $1.5bn+ a month very soon</u></a>), does it really think it’s going to effectively 10x the entire company from here? What possible sign is there of that happening other than a conga-line of different executives willing to stake their reputations on blatant lies peddled by a man best known for needing, at any given moment, <em>another billion dollars</em>. </p><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-first-half-results-4-3-billion-sales-2-5-billion-cash-burn?utm_campaign=%5BREBRAND%5D+RTSU+-+Aut&amp;utm_content=1109&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=129&amp;rc=kz8jh3"><u>According to The Information</u></a>, OpenAI spent $6.7 billion on research and development in the first six months of 2025, and according to Epoch AI, <a href="https://epoch.ai/data-insights/openai-compute-spend?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>most of the $5 billion it spent on research and development in 2024</u></a> was spent on research, experimental, or derisking runs (basically running tests before doing the final testing run) and models it would never release, with only $480 million going to training <em>actual models that people will use.</em> </p><p>I should also add that <a href="https://futurism.com/openai-screwed-up-gpt-4-5?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>GPT 4.5 was a dud</u></a>, and <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1895203654103351462?lang=en&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>even Altman called it giant, expensive, and said it “wouldn’t crush benchmarks.”</u></a></p><p>I’m sorry, but what exactly is it that OpenAI has released in the last year-and-a-half that was worth burning $11.7 billion for? GPT 5? <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/how-does-gpt-5-work/"><u>That was a huge letdown</u></a>!

Sure, it’ll get a few things right a lot of the time, but what task is it able to do every time that you actually need? </p><p>Say the answer is “something that took me an hour now takes me five minutes.” Cool! How many of those do you get?

That’s $23.5 billion more than the $368 billion <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/oracle-buy-40-billion-nvidia-chips-openais-us-data-center-ft-reports-2025-05-23/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>of global venture capital raised in 2024</u></a>!
