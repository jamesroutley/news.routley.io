    <h1>Ask HN: Do you regret being a generalist?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m a fairly young SWE in my early twenties, and I&#39;ve tried a bit of everything.</p><p>Fullstack web dev, a bit of cyber security, a bit of AI, mobile apps, all kind of automation/bots/mass scraping, growth hacking, small games, low level C...</p><p>And I&#39;m starting to wonder if I should specialize.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been interested by AI, but since it&#39;s such a large/complex field, I never really took the time to dedicate myself to it completely because I&#39;m always interested by 10 things at the same time.</p><p>I have absolutely zero doubts about my employability, but I&#39;m afraid to regret it long term if I don&#39;t specialize in an interesting field.</p><p>Do you regret being a generalist? Have you been one in the past and then changed? In that case what do you prefer? Do you regret it?</p></div></div></div>
