<ul><li><strong>You can obtain a free federal tax return: </strong> If you are new to Free File, you can choose a Free File company’s Free File offer based on your review of the offer qualifications listed on IRS.gov. If you choose a program and qualify, you will not be charged for preparation and e-filing of a federal tax return. </li>
	<li>If you used IRS Free File last year, you will receive an email from the same company that you used, welcoming you back to their official IRS Free File services. The email must include a link to the company’s IRS Free File site and explain how to file with it.  If you choose this email link and qualify, you will not be charged for preparation and e-filing of a federal tax return. </li>
	<li><strong>Fees to file your federal return are prohibited: </strong> No participant in the Free File Program will charge you anything to file your federal tax return if you qualify. You will not be asked to buy any products or services (for example, promotional rebates) in exchange for having your Federal tax return prepared by the Free File program participant. </li>
	<li><strong>Bank products with fees are not a part of Free File. </strong>As part of IRS Free File, you must not be offered bank products that often carry product fees, such as refund transfer products (e.g., refund anticipation loans (RALs)). </li>
	<li><strong>Free state returns may be available:</strong> Some IRS Free File Program partner companies offer free state tax preparation. Others charge a state fee.  Be sure to read each company’s information carefully. </li>
	<li><strong>Each Free File Company Guarantees the Accuracy of the Return Calculations:</strong> Each company lists this guarantee on its Free File website. You can pursue any accuracy concerns directly with the company that prepared your return. </li>
	<li><strong>You have choices:</strong> If you don’t qualify for an IRS Free File offer after visiting a company’s Free File website, you can return to the IRS.gov Free File website to seek a Free File offer that may meet your needs. Each IRS Free File company will provide you information when you don’t qualify, with a link back to the IRS.gov Free File site. </li>
