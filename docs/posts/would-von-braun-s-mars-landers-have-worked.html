<h2 id="landing-boats">Landing Boats</h2>
<p>Wernher von Braun’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Project">Das
Marsprojekt</a></em> envisioned a flotilla of 10 ships, operated by not
less than 70 men, that would depart Earth orbit for Mars. Once at Mars,
the transfer ships would remain in orbit while winged “landing boats”
would fly as gliders down to the surface.</p>

<p>As if this weren’t already ambitious enough, the plan actually called
for one boat to land with ski-type landing gear in the icy polar
regions. Its crew would then unload earth-moving equipment, make the
long trek down to the equatorial region, and construct an airstrip so
that the other landing boats, equipped with conventional tricycle
landing gear, could come down. (Presumably the bravest and most highly
skilled men in the expedition would have been on the ice boat, as they
would be landing on totally strange terrain with no chance of
rescue!)</p>
<h2 id="in-light-of-current-knowledge">In Light of Current
Knowledge</h2>
<p>In computing the necessary lift and therefore the boats’ required
wing area, von Braun considered the acceleration due to Martian gravity
as about 38% that of Earth’s and the density of the Martian atmosphere
as about 8% that of Earth’s.</p>
<p>Of course, much more is now known of Mars’ atmosphere than in 1952.
In light of today’s knowledge, would von Braun’s winged ships have
actually worked? Here’s a back-of-the-envelope calculation using the
properties of the Martian atmosphere that are now known. (Note that
atmosphere percentages may total slightly above or below 100 due to
rounding and measurement uncertainty.)</p>

<p>The Ideal Gas Law relates pressure, volume, amount of substance, and
temperature as follows:</p>
<p>pV = nRT</p>
<p>wherein p is pressure (pascals), V is volume (cubic meters), n is
amount of substance (moles), T is temperature (Kelvin), and R = 8.314
J/K·mol is the ideal gas constant. For a known temperature and pressure,
the ideal gas law will predict the volume occupied by 1 mole of gas when
algebraically rearranged as:</p>
<p>V = RT/p</p>
<p>Here is the relevant data:</p>

<p>The Ideal Gas Law therefore indicates these properties for the
atmosphere of both planets:</p>

<p>Mars’ atmospheric density is only about 1% that of Earth! Von Braun,
who estimated it at 1/12 that of Earth, was too optimistic by about
800%. This isn’t looking good for our landing boats … let’s keep
going.</p>
<h2 id="the-fate-of-the-boats">The Fate of the Boats</h2>
<p>Von Braun’s landing boats had a wing area of 2810 m<sup>2</sup> and
massed 185 Mg. At 0.38 <em>g</em>, the required wing loading was
therefore no less than 245 N/m<sup>2</sup>. (Surprisingly, this is about
the same wing loading as a Piper Cherokee.) The design landing speed was
196 km/h (54.5 m/s).</p>
<p>How much lift would these wings have produced in the real Martian
atmosphere? Well, the basic aerodynamic lift equation is:</p>
<p>L = C<sub>L</sub>½ρV<sup>2</sup>S</p>
<p>wherein ρ is air density, V is airspeed, S is wing area, and
C<sub>L</sub> is the lift coefficient. (Lift coefficients are determined
experimentally for given air conditions, body geometries, and angles of
attack. The quantity ½ρV<sup>2</sup> is also referred to as “dynamic
pressure” or <em>Q</em>. If you’ve heard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_q">“max <em>Q</em>”</a> called
out during a rocket launch, this is the quantity they were referring
to.)</p>
<p>Von Braun supplied a lift coefficient of 1.3, which he considered the
optimum attainable with trailing-edge and leading-edge flaps. Using this
coefficient and the other design criteria, I calculate the lift produced
at Martian sea level by a landing boat at 336 kN, and therefore the wing
loading at 120 N/m<sup>2</sup>: a pitiful 49% of the lift required for
the boat to support its own weight!</p>
<p>What a letdown. It’s not enough that the real-world Solar System put
a nail in the coffin of the cozy one envisioned in the Golden Age of
science fiction (where we had web-footed friends on a jungly but
habitable Venus or perhaps a stilted but cordial relationship with the
Great Old Ones of Mars.) Even the rosy visions of mid-20th century
science “fact” have now succumbed to the inexorable march of new
knowledge.</p>
<p>Still … can you imagine?</p>
