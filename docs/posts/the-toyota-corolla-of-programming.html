    <h1>The Toyota Corolla of programming</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="document"><div><p><span><span>I</span>n</span> 1995, an otherwise unknown software developer released the first version of a new scripting language whose explicit aim was to make applications for this new platform called “The World Wide Web”. After starting as a small project, and thanks to the crazy dot-com years, it grew dramatically to become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time. After some stumbling first steps, it eventually got some sort of standardization in 1997, even reluctantly including some OOP features to please community and pundits alike.</p><p>However, no matter how hard it tried, this language and its users were mocked for decades by so-called “serious” programmers, who derided its “WTF”-level syntax, the quirks of its runtime model, its ever-increasing amount of security issues, or the gazillion frameworks that sprang around it. Despite the backlash, this language and its community prevailed, eventually getting a huge second act, including some explicit support from Big Tech themselves. Nowadays, as the language reaches the glorious age of 30, a new project drives its future evolution thanks to the strengths of the Go programming language.</p><p>Interestingly enough, the description spread across the two paragraphs above fits not just one but two programming languages: on one side, PHP, heavily inspired by Perl and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi/c/PyJ25gZ6z7A/m/M9FkTUVDfcwJ?lidx=2&amp;wpid=363176&amp;pli=1">released</a> by Rasmus Lerdorf in June 1995 with the name “Personal Home Page Tools”; and on the other hand JavaScript, designed by Brendan Eich and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060111090514/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html">released</a> December of that same year by Netscape.</p><p>But the parallels between both languages do not stop there. In 1997, they got both some level of standardization, thanks to <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/phpfi2.php">PHP/FI 2</a> and <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-262_1st_edition_june_1997.pdf">ECMA-262</a>. During the 2010s, each language got major support from Facebook on one side, and Google and Microsoft on the other side. And in 2025, they both got a major revamp effort based on the <a href="http://iafisher.com/the-age-of-concurrency/">Go programming language</a>: a new PHP runtime called <a href="https://frankenphp.dev/">FrankenPHP</a>, and the recently announced <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/">TypeScript compiler</a>.</p><p>PHP and JavaScript represent two faces of the same coin: web programming, both server-side and client-side. The growth of the <a href="http://iafisher.com/from-hypertext-to-spas-to-hypertext/">World Wide Web</a> transformed them into major players, despite their (let us be honest) quite jarring initial design flaws, their slow committee-based evolution, and the seemingly endless series of security flaws that plagued their respective ecosystems.</p><p>An oft-quoted <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/quotes.html">smirk</a> by Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, states that</p><blockquote><p>There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.</p></blockquote><p>Two years ago we published an issue about <a href="http://iafisher.com/programming-the-liberal-arts/">BASIC</a>, the programming language that all developers love to hate but which single-handedly defined a whole era in our industry. It is only fair that we dedicate some words to PHP, the one everyone also complains about, the one everyone <a href="https://php-ceo.medium.com/">laughs</a> about, yet <a href="https://kinsta.com/php-market-share/">apparently</a> powers between 70 and 80 percent of the world’s websites; needless to say, an impressive number, no matter how hard you look at it, and no matter how much “serious” programmers laugh about it.</p><p>Throughout history, programming languages have received interesting, if revealing, epithets. C is said to be “portable assembly”. <a href="http://iafisher.com/write-anywhere-run-once/">Java</a> is good for “write once, debug anywhere”. <a href="http://iafisher.com/the-state-of-python-in-2021/">Python</a> is usually referred to as “executable pseudocode”. <a href="http://iafisher.com/innovationscript/">JavaScript</a> “was created in 10 days, and it shows”. Perl is the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/programmers-arent-humble-anymore-nobody-codes-in-perl/">“duct tape of the Internet”</a>.</p><p>And, well, PHP is either a “fractal of bad design” (seriously, people?) or an acronym meaning “Pretty Horrific Programming”. Ouch.</p><p>Here is how I see things: PHP is the <em>lingua franca</em> of affordable <del>cloud</del> web hosting options; or, in other terms, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Corolla">Toyota Corolla</a> of programming languages: boring, solid, easy, and affordable. You can find, almost anywhere in the world, an affordable web hosting option offering the saint quadrinity of LAMP: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP; an operating system, a web server, a database server, and a scripting language, in an inexpensive package, enabling the masses to go further. Paraphrasing George Clooney, what else?</p><p>These days, PHP features many traits of a modern programming language; let us enumerate some, beginning with its fully <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">open-source</a> nature. It has advanced <a href="http://iafisher.com/the-hype-cycle-of-oop/">OOP</a> features like <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.traits.php">traits</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.property-hooks.php">property hooks</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php">namespaces</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.attributes.overview.php">attributes</a>, and <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.enumerations.php">enums</a>. It includes functional programming constructs, like <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php">closures</a> with capture lists and <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arrow.php">arrow functions</a>, and a “pipe” operator <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/07/11/php-85-adds-pipe-operator/">coming next November</a> (rejoice, OCaml and F# developers!). PHP has associative arrays, and a rudimentary yet fast, useful, and growing type checking system (remember: <code>declare(strict_types=1);</code> is your friend) including <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.never.php"><code>never</code></a> and <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php">nullable types</a>. It bundles a full library of algorithms ready to use, following the “batteries included” mantra, and if all else fails, there is a powerful and open-source <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">package manager</a> with <a href="https://packagist.org/">enough packages</a> to make <code>npm</code> blush. There is excellent support for <a href="https://phpunit.de/index.html">unit testing</a>. As scripting programming languages go, it is quite fast to compile and execute. It has its own ecosystem of conferences, <a href="https://afieldguidetoelephpants.net/">a mascot</a>, and even a powerful <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">IDE</a> made by none other than JetBrains.</p><p>But, alas, it does feature <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.goto.php">a <code>goto</code> operator</a>. Oh, là, là! What would Dijkstra say! Not to mention those pesky variables prefixed with a stupid dollar sign, and a cringeworthy <code>foreach</code> statement. The ignominy!</p><p>Most so-called “serious” programmers would be wise to step down from their ivory tower and take a look at PHP in 2025 before an LLM kicks them out of their job. The language has seen major, steady, and consistent revamps for the past decade, including a stable release rhythm once per year, every November, plus a dedicated team that has been <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/74/PHP.html">consistently</a> removing security vulnerabilities, and removing obsolete APIs with newer and safer ones.</p><p>I know they should take another look at PHP, because I myself had to step down from my own ivory tower and do that. It is only fair to state my <em>mea culpa</em>: back in 2009 I participated in a (admittedly useless) community effort called “I Hate PHP” (of which the Internet Archive has duly kept <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071213013127/https://www.ihatephp.net/">a copy</a>) where my name appeared prominently on the front page. I plead guilty, your honor.</p><p>In my defense, I will argue that those were the somewhat darker ages of PHP. Those were the times of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beyond-java/0596100949/">Bruce Tate’s “Beyond Java”</a> and its long diatribes against PHP spread in the pages therein.</p><p>Remember the long-gone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050210035857/http://phpsec.org/">PHP Security Consortium</a>? Are the days of <a href="https://bobby-tables.com/">Little Bobby Tables</a> over? Let us be honest; not really. You can still release code with SQL injection vulnerabilities if you want (hint: avoid the <code>.</code> operator as much as you can. For all things that are no database queries, <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.parsing">string interpolation</a> is your friend).</p><p>The <a href="http://iafisher.com/pastor-manul-laphroaig/">Rt. Rvd. Pastor Manul Laphroaig</a>, in his <a href="https://archive.org/details/Pocorgtfo01/page/n13/mode/2up">sermon</a> to the Beloved Congregation of the First United Church of the Weird Machines, claimed that there is divinity in every programming language… including PHP:</p><blockquote><p>If a language like PHP introduces so many people to pwnage, then that is its divinity. It provides a first step for children to learn how program execution goes astray, with control and data so easy to mangle.</p></blockquote><p>Amen.</p><p>Nowadays, what I see now is a healthy, thriving <a href="http://iafisher.com/the-tragedy-of-the-common-enemy/">community</a> around PHP. One that, with the exception from JetBrains, is not encumbered by the whims of a FAANG or any other “Big Tech” firm. And the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/">PHP Foundation</a> is driving the evolution of its <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/">standards</a> towards the future, hopefully navigating that unstable space between money and people.</p><p>Take these numbers with a grain of salt, but if we look at language ratings, there is a lot of terrain to reclaim back: on TIOBE, even if PHP was named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050113041221/http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm">language of the year 2004</a>, it presently appears at the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/php/">15th position</a> and going down: it used to be 3rd in 2010. In the IEEE ranking, it appears in the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2024">13th position</a>, and on the <a href="https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">7th position</a> at PYPL, which is quite a drop in the past 20 years. But hey! It appears <a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2025/06/18/language-rankings-1-25/">4th</a> at the RedMonk ranking, and the <a href="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/files/2025/06/redmonk-language-rankings-jan-2025-1.png">graph</a> shows that the fall from 2013 to now has not been <em>that</em> strong. Not all is lost!</p><p>Jokes aside, the most important developments in the history of PHP had to do with the engines used to power it. For decades, the <a href="https://www.zend.com/">Zend engine</a> served as the reference point for the evolution of the language; designed for the needs of the World Wide Web of 1999 (a world of LAMP stacks) and as good as it was for its time, it could not evolve gracefully into a world of DevOps, containers, and <a href="http://iafisher.com/antonomasia/">Kubernetes</a> orchestrators.</p><p>(Raise your hand if you have ever tried to put together a <code>Dockerfile</code> with Nginx, <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php">FPM</a>, and <a href="https://supervisord.org/">Supervisor</a>, to run some forgotten PHP 7.1 application. I feel your pain, my friend.)</p><p>Thankfully, we can move away from Zend now. Thanks to the unpredictable power of its community, there is this thing called <a href="https://frankenphp.dev/">FrankenPHP</a>. This project has been recently <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/06/08/php-30/">adopted</a> by the PHP Foundation as an official runtime, and it ticks all the boxes that could propel PHP into another orbit.</p><p>FrankenPHP not only dramatically simplifies the creation of containers, but it also provides new execution models for PHP code, all while offering 100% compatibility with the massive existing codebase. We talk more about FrankenPHP <a href="http://iafisher.com/k%C3%A9vin-dunglas/">in the Vidéothèque section</a> this month.</p><p>As nice as FrankenPHP is, I do not count on the end of the backlash against PHP anytime soon. The language will continue to suffer the stigma of its humble beginnings. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf">Rasmus Lerdorf</a> did not get an interview in <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/masterminds-of-programming/9780596801670/">“Masterminds of Programming”</a>, because PHP is the quintessential language built in a bazaar, as the fruit of an accidental <del>affair</del> design. Nor will Rasmus be invited to the next <a href="http://iafisher.com/jean-sammet/">HOPL conference</a>, despite the unreasonable popularity of the language, nor will PHP be used for PhD dissertations (other than those related to security, that is). To add insult to injury, PHP is not even mentioned in the <a href="http://iafisher.com/geoffrey-james/">Tao of Programming</a> (OK, OK, it was published in 1987, I give you that).</p><p>But thankfully IEEE’s “Computer Magazine” did pay attention to PHP, and followed suit with an interview of Rasmus in both <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/co/2012/11/mco2012110006/13rRUILLkze">written</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIGRXEzjE6c">video</a> formats, published in 2012.</p><p>At least that. In that interview, Rasmus states the core philosophy behind the bazaar:</p><blockquote><p>I learned a bit along the way that, for this to grow, I had to give up control of PHP—I had to let other people have some control. (…) It’s not just them contributing to my project—it becomes our project, and that really changed the nature of PHP.</p></blockquote><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@kobuagency?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">KOBU Agency</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/hello-world-text-67L18R4tW_w?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>.</p></div></article></div>
