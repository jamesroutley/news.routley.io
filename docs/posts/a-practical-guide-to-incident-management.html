    <h1>A practical guide to incident management</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
    Every company needs a plan for when things go wrong. I&#39;ve written these plans many times now,
    and every time I&#39;ve wished for a reference that reflects the way companies actually work today.
  </p><p>
    So here it is — our many years of collective knowledge and experience distilled into a
    <em>practical guide</em> for your whole organisation. Enjoy!

          <p>
            We’ll begin with our thoughts about on-call,
            including what it means, who’s involved and how
            it should be compensated.

          <p>
            We’ll explain some basics including what an
            incident is and how to measure the impact of incidents.
