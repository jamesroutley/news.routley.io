      <span>Abstract:</span>  Project Management anti-patterns are well-documented in the
software-engineering literature, and studying them allows understanding their
impacts on teams and projects. The video game development industry is known for
its mismanagement practices, and therefore applying this knowledge would help
improving game developers&#39; productivity and well-being. In this paper, we map
project management anti-patterns to anti-patterns reported by game developers
in the gray literature. We read 440 postmortems problems, identified
anti-pattern candidates, and related them with definitions from the
software-engineering literature. We discovered that most anti-pattern
candidates could be mapped to anti-patterns in the software-engineering
literature, except for Feature Creep, Feature Cuts, Working on Multiple
Projects, and Absent or Inadequate Tools. We discussed the impact of the
unmapped candidates on the development process while also drawing a parallel
between video games and traditional software development. Future works include
validating the definitions of the candidates via survey with practitioners and
also considering development anti-patterns.
