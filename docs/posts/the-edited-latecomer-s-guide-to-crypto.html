        On March 20, 2022, the <i>New York Times</i> published a 14,000-word puff piece on cryptocurrencies, both 
        online and as an <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1505582695287468036">entire section of the Sunday print edition</a>. Though 
        its author, Kevin Roose, wrote that it aimed to be a &#34;sober, dispassionate explanation of what crypto actually
        <i>is</i>&#34;, it was a thinly-veiled advertisement for cryptocurrency that appeared to have received little
        in the way of fact-checking or critical editorial scrutiny. It uncritically repeated many questionable or 
        entirely fallacious arguments from cryptocurrency advocates, and it appears that no experts on the topic
        were consulted, or even anyone with a less-than-rosy view on crypto. This is grossly irresponsible.
      </p>
      <p>Here, a group of around <a href="#contributors">fifteen cryptocurrency researchers and critics</a> have done what the <i>New York Times</i> apparently won&#39;t.</p>

            <p>Crypto skeptic Ben McKenzie has <a href="https://youtu.be/AijwGyNLtjc?t=865">argued</a> that this is a sign that the bubble has become precariously large, not that crypto has become ubiquitous: &#34;The celebrities are a symptom of a much bigger problem... You&#39;ve got all this money and you&#39;re trying to get it out to more people and get more people to buy. And if one were to compare cryptocurrency to, say, an MLM or a ponzi, then you would need ever more people to come in to keep the thing going. Celebrities are sort of the natural endpoint for that. At its biggest, you need the biggest: you need Matt Damon and Larry David and sports stars to sell it.&#34; (<i>Crypto Critics&#39; Corner</i>, episode 51)

            <p>Roose fails to mention the many companies who have jumped <i>off</i> the bandwagon as quickly as they jumped on, after realizing that their users are not only uninterested in being sold NFTs, but actively oppose them. <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/canceled-gaming-nft-2022-2021">Countless video game projects</a>, <a href="https://www.glossy.co/fashion/meundies-nfts-customer-backlash/">MeUndies</a>, <a href="https://gorillazland.com/2021/06/06/3248/#nfts">The Gorillaz</a>, and the <a href="https://futurism.com/wwf-cancels-nft-project">World Wildlife Foundation</a> are just a few companies and groups who&#39;ve canceled NFT projects after announcing them due to backlash from customers or supporters.</p>

           Crypto! For years, it seemed like the kind of fleeting tech trend most people could safely ignore, like hoverboards or Google Glass. But its power, both economic and cultural, has become too big to overlook. <mark data-annotation-id="1" aria-details="percent-adults-own-crypto">Twenty percent of American adults, and 36 percent of millennials, own cryptocurrency, according to a recent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/05/2022-consumer-electronics-show/">Morning Consult survey</a></mark>. Coinbase, the crypto trading app, has landed on top of the App Store’s top charts <a href="https://decrypt.co/84653/coinbase-returns-to-no-1-in-apple-us-app-store">at least twice</a> in the past year. <mark data-annotation-id="2" aria-details="market-cap">Today, the crypto market is valued at around $1.75 trillion</mark> — roughly the size of Google.

              <p>As David Gerard wrote in his 2017 book <i>Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain</i>, &#34;Cryptocurrency advocates and lazy journalists like to talk about the &#39;market cap&#39; of crypto, which is the total number of coins or tokens in existence multiplied by today&#39;s price. This is a bogus number that&#39;s not actually applicable to anything — it&#39;s not money that was put into the crypto, it&#39;s not a realisable value like a company market cap, it doesn&#39;t affect prices — it&#39;s just an easily-calculated number that sounds good in a headline. Trading is so thin in any crypto, even Bitcoin, that you could never realise a fraction of the number.&#34;
            </p></div>
            <div> 
              <p>Yeah, market cap is a meaningless number. It assumes everyone bought at the current price and could cash out at the current price.

           As it’s gone mainstream, crypto has inspired an unusually polarized discourse. Its biggest fans think it’s saving the world, while its biggest skeptics are convinced it’s all a scam — an environment-killing speculative bubble orchestrated by grifters and sold to greedy dupes, which will probably crash the economy when it bursts.</p>

           I’ve been writing about crypto for nearly a decade, a period in which <mark aria-details="rooses-views">my own views have whipsawed between extreme skepticism and cautious optimism. These days, I usually describe myself as a crypto moderate</mark>, although I admit that may be a cop-out.</p>

            <p>This is a statement desperately in need of some links. Although Roose has linked to his writing quite liberally throughout this article, it certainly doesn&#39;t show &#34;extreme skepticism&#34;, nor for that matter does his optimism seem particularly cautious. This article notably doesn&#39;t seem to link to his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/penguin-nft-club.html">August 2021 <i>Times</i> article about the &#34;Pudgy Penguins&#34; NFT project</a>, which served to lend the project legitimacy and pump the price before the group later attempted to scam a prospective buyer of the company. No follow-up was ever published—this is a recurring theme for the articles Roose writes about various crypto projects, as you will see throughout this commentary.</p>
            <p>Roose has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220219172535/https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1495085866192027655">publicly advocated</a> for journalists who write about crypto to be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies and NFTs, despite himself acknowledging the &#34;strong biasing effect&#34; it would have and that the traditional finance equivalent of this behavior is prohibited by most reputable publications. He holds the <code>cryptoroose.eth</code> <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/ethereum-name-service-ens-explained-guide-learn">ENS domain</a> (which he <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdd58208d954f61ed181899d4380266246eb483c8e0cb6bf2d471cc4fb64708e1">bought</a> in October for $21... plus another $136 in transaction fees.)</p>

           Recently, I spent several months reading everything I could about crypto. But I found that most beginner’s guides took the form of boring podcasts, thinly researched YouTube videos and blog posts written by hopelessly biased investors. <mark data-annotation-id="1" aria-details="undercut-inaccuracies">Many anti-crypto takes, on the other hand, were undercut by inaccuracies and outdated arguments</mark>, such as <mark data-annotation-id="2" aria-details="good-for-criminals">the assertion that crypto is good for criminals, notwithstanding the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/technology/bitcoin-untraceable-pipeline-ransomware.html">growing</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/13/nyregion/bitcoin-bitfinex-hack-heather-morgan-ilya-lichtenstein.html">evidence</a> that crypto’s traceable ledgers make it a poor fit for illicit activity</mark>.</p>

              <p>As I explored in my <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/techgirl1908/status/1501216120707162118">Spaces with Angie</a> the other day, I come to this with a very different lens: from the point of view of software and systems architecture, cryptocurrencies are computationally inefficient, fragile, demonstrably unable to scale to global levels, and - most damning - introduce an incredibly broad and dangerous attack surface. Whether or not you agree with the philosophy/economics behind cryptocurrencies, they are - simply put - a software architecture disaster in the making.

          <div role="comment" data-annotation-id="2" id="good-for-criminals"> 
            <div> 
              <p><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">According to Chainalysis</a>, illicit addresses received $14 billion in 2021, almost twice the amount they did in 2020. Roose uses as an example the case of two alleged criminals whose level of incompetence reportedly includes storing private keys in Dropbox cloud storage, and keeping a file on their desktop called &#34;passport ideas&#34;, and yet even they operated for 5 1/2 years before being arrested.
            </p></div>
            
            <div> 
              <p>So even if this is true:
              </p><ol> 
                <li>There are cryptos where you struggle to see on-chain activity: Monero/Zcash</li>
                <li>There are layer 2 designs that obfuscate transactions</li>
                <li>There is the ability to bridge between chains to make tracking increasingly more challenging</li>
                <li>There are on-chain obfuscation technologies like Tornado Cash and Samurai</li>
                <li>Part of the nature of the illicit activity that crypto enables is as a pretense for integration in money laundering</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div> 
              
              <p>Notwithstanding that, yes, competent criminals can absolutely use crypto for illicit activity—isn&#39;t the flip side of this argument that blockchain ledgers are fundamentally privacy-less? If the argument is that it&#39;s easy to track criminals through crypto ledgers, then it would be easy to track anyone through them. Especially the average person, who doesn&#39;t know how to obfuscate their activity.</p>
              <p>In what universe is it a good idea for everyone&#39;s financial transactions to be publicly available (especially to, as this very sentence implies, to law enforcement)? &#34;Debunking&#34; this anti-crypto argument only forms a stronger, much more critical one.</p>

            <div>
              <p>Roose claims to be giving &#34;the view from nowhere&#34; but his entire thesis here is loaded with all these assumptions that somehow somewhere there actually is a &#34;there&#34; there and yet he can&#39;t even point to it.

          <p>Crypto boosters will likely quibble with my explanations, while dug-in opponents may find them too generous. That’s OK. My goal is not to convince you that crypto is good or bad, that it should be outlawed or celebrated, or that investing in it will make you rich or bankrupt you. It is simply to demystify things a bit. And if you want to go deeper, each section has a list of reading suggestions at the end.</p>

          <h3>Crypto will be transformative</h3>
          <p>Understanding crypto now — <mark aria-details="naturally-skeptical">especially if you’re naturally skeptical</mark> — is important for a few reasons.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div> 
        <div>
          <div role="comment" id="naturally-skeptical">
            
            <p>While I appreciate Kevin’s attempt to “explain” crypto to the masses, his very introduction is problematic. Why would understanding crypto be of particular importance for the “naturally skeptical?” Wouldn’t it make more sense to posit that understanding crypto was of greater immediate importance to those likely to invest money that perhaps they couldn’t afford to lose? Isn’t it more likely that the “naturally skeptical” are probably more familiar with how crypto works than the “naturally embracing” given the amount of pro-crypto propaganda to which we are constantly bombarded? And even the use of the term “naturally” is itself intriguing and telling—suggesting that skepticism is likely to stem from a certain form of romantic and emotional uniformed resistance to change a la Larry David rather than from the application of reason and the too-rare employment of critical thinking.</p>
            <p>To fully explain crypto to the masses, one might be forgiven for thinking that priority number one should be to carefully and fully describe the manifest financial risks, and to explain to the innocent how crypto is anchored in, and supports, a vision of society in which public institutions and functions are replaced by private parties. And how that vision naturally aligns with, and advances, a political agenda that undermines progressive ideas of society and government, regardless of one’s personal views of how it might be employed to advance a particular noble or progressive cause. Kevin wants us to know that not every person that invests in crypto does so out of pure selfishness, or to support regressive frameworks of governance. That is undoubtedly true, but it entirely misses the point. </p>

              <p>Okay, so I sort of see what he&#39;s going for here in his clumsy way. There is a libertarian bent that&#39;s sort of meshing with crypto and web3 - crypto has been absorbed into the right wing part of tech. </p>
              <p>The wealth could be interesting, but this is also something that is easily questioned.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>Technolibertarianism has been around longer than crypto, though—why are we now taking it on faith that it will be a &#34;transformative force... in the coming years&#34;?
            </p></div>
            <div>
              <p>This is where Roose goes from being objective to prescriptive. With no justification. Just that crypto is &#34;inevitable&#34; for no reason.

            <div>
              <p>You cannot write this line then refuse to engage with the political thought that has influenced crypto.  You just can&#39;t.  You have to talk about what ideology that wealth is going to be used to advance.  Talk about the candidates they are giving money to who support evil things.  Talk about something please Kevin.

              <p>This links to a Kevin Roose article in the <i>NYT</i> about Glauber Contessoto, who took all his savings and borrowed money to put ~$250,000 into Dogecoin, and was boasting holdings worth $2 million when this article was written in May 2021—which was also when Dogecoin reached its all-time-high of around $0.70. Dogecoin is currently priced at around $0.12 and the &#34;Dogecoin millionaire&#34; is back to being a hundred-thousand-aire who serves to inspire others to make enormously risky decisions and hold their positions beyond all reason. Roose, of course, has not written about this part.

No technical plan for the project has been disclosed.&#34; Furthermore, the first $1 billion that Bukele hopes to raise through &#34;volcano bonds&#34; are earmarked for purposes unrelated to building this supposed Bitcoin City, though those bonds were just paused due to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/el-salvador-postpones-bitcoin-bond-issue-expects-better-conditions-2022-03-22/">unfavorable market conditions</a>.</p>

              <p>I suspect there is much less overlap between the &#34;wealthy&#34; and the &#34;true believers&#34; than Roose posits here. The true believers don&#39;t tend to be the ones hoovering up VC investments or spinning up new shitcoins to pump and dump. Some of the wealthy (e.g. some of the folks behind exchanges like Binance and Kraken) parrot true believer talking points, but I suspect those are not so much strongly-held convictions as they are convenient ways to launder their work as ideological rather than money-driven. I talked a little bit about the true believers and those who just repeat the true believers&#39; talking points in <a href="https://youtu.be/WB_luMPwiXo?t=990"><i>This Week In Startups</i></a> last month.

The prototypes of social media were already over a decade old, and the core product, micro-updates, chat functionality, and asynchronous communication, was already a deeply well proven feature for a decade before that via message boards, IRC, ICQ, and MSN messenger. The arguments revolved mostly around specific companies surviving the churn cycle of the 00s, but &#34;will Facebook be the next Friendster?&#34; isn&#39;t as useful for painting these un-cited critics as dinosaurs who just didn&#39;t get it.

               People absolutely were asking these questions (see Matt Binder&#39;s comment above), though Roose seems to have set himself up for the defense of &#34;well sure, but they weren&#39;t being <i>loud</i> enough&#34;. What does &#34;loud enough&#34; look like? Are the people asking these questions of crypto being loud enough?</p>
            <div>
              <p>Quite a few ethicists were talking about this, but we were mostly in academia so I guess that&#39;s not loud enough for him. Here&#39;s the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon-Rogerson/publication/296786273_ETHICOMP_2011_Conference_Proceedings_The_Social_Impact_of_Social_Computing/links/56da9c8908aebe4638bbe3e0/ETHICOMP-2011-Conference-Proceedings-The-Social-Impact-of-Social-Computing.pdf">entire list of abstracts from ETHICOMP 2011</a>, for example, with plenty of ethical analyses of social media that assumed it would be successful.

              <p>So I&#39;ve been in tech ethics for almost 20 years now and I was bashing down doors trying to get someone to talk to me (and colleagues too); it&#39;s only really since AI came in that we&#39;ve been actively sought after because finally the big companies realised maybe this tech thing needs a bit more than technical know-how.

(Where it&#39;s referring to anyone in specific at all, that is.) But which of those groups are supposed to have the power to &#34;steer&#34; anything?</p>
              <p>Or to quote <a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/can-the-media-stop-crypto">Max Read</a> on this one: &#34;I&#39;m also increasingly less convinced that a &#39;better&#39; tech journalism, by any definition of the word, would have made a particular difference in how the internet of the 21st century has unfolded so far. What strikes me looking back at tech journalism of the 2000s is how fast Facebook (to take the most prominent example) was growing: zero to 500 million users in just five years. I&#39;m not sure any analysis or criticism, no matter how damning, could have slowed that kind of planetary momentum — and there was plenty of good analysis and criticism of Facebook at the time. What was missing was a coherent, organized, well-resourced political movement that could have matched Facebook&#39;s size, speed, and capital.&#34;</p>

In fact, ironically, isn&#39;t it that most of the pundits <i>are not</i> trying to sell something, and in fact are trying to keep people away from selling/buying/trading crypto? It&#39;s a lazy rhetorical device that paints the entire set of skeptics as being self-interested and just descends into &#34;both sidesism&#34;. The more I write about it, it makes me more annoyed.

            <p>Roose is again citing questionable surveys to make broad claims... I don&#39;t doubt his conclusion in this particular case, but he really needs to work with better data. The poll in question is from the Gemini crypto exchange and featured a &#34;total sample of 3,000 U.S. adults, ages 18 to 65 with $40,000 or more in household income. Survey respondents were polled from October 19-November 16, 2020, and included 921 self-identifying current cryptocurrency owners and 1,697 consumers who were interested in learning more about cryptocurrency.&#34; The <i>Cheddar News</i> article he&#39;s linking here tries to claim that it also suggests crypto is somehow becoming more diverse, which is the more eyebrow-raising claim, but at least not one that Roose has chosen to make.

            <p>That sounds fair perhaps, but it entirely ignores the fact that choices made by individuals have consequences for all of society. This is not merely a personal investment choice whose effects are limited to the financial realm. Indeed, Kevin himself notes elsewhere that: “It’s an organized technological movement, armed with powerful tools and hordes of wealthy true believers, whose goal is nothing less than a total economic and political revolution.” So is he saying to “participate or abstain” in a revolution as you wish, as if the results of that revolution will be limited to the willing participants thereof?

          <h4>Let’s start from the beginning: What is crypto?</h4>
          <p>A decade or two ago, the word was generally used as shorthand for cryptography. But in recent years, it’s been more closely associated with cryptocurrencies. These days, “crypto” usually refers to the entire universe of technologies that involve blockchains — the distributed ledger systems that power digital currencies like Bitcoin, but also serve as the base layer of technology for things like <mark aria-details="nfts-web3">NFTs, web3 applications and DeFi trading protocols.</mark></p>

          <div role="comment" id="nfts-web3">
            <p>It&#39;s really bizarre that Roose describes this as a no-nonsense explainer for people trying to figure out what on earth all this crypto stuff even is, but then also uses all this jargon like &#34;NFTs&#34;, &#34;web3&#34;, and &#34;DeFi&#34; in this long introductory section without describing what any of these terms mean until much, much later. It seems like he can&#39;t find his audience.

          <h4>Ah yes, blockchains. Can you remind me, without going into too much technical detail, what they are?</h4>
          <p>At a very basic level, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/business/dealbook/blockchains-guide-information.html">blockchains</a> are shared databases that store and <mark aria-details="verify">verify</mark> information in a cryptographically secure way.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div> 
        <div>
          <p>&#34;Validation/verification&#34; has a specific computer science meaning and like many of these things they don&#39;t tend to translate well into everyday jargon. Using this term in this way is likely to mislead the average reader, who would likely interpret this to mean that there is some verification of the <i>accuracy</i> of any information that is added to a blockchain. The verification that I believe he is intending to describe is other nodes verifying that some data exists on the chain, not verifying that the data is any good, and he should be much more explicit about that.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div> 
      <div> 
        <p>You can think of a blockchain like a Google spreadsheet, except that instead of being hosted on Google’s servers, blockchains are maintained by a network of computers all over the world. These computers (sometimes called miners or validators) are responsible for storing their own copies of the database, adding and verifying new entries, and <mark aria-details="miners-secure" data-annotation-id="1">securing the database against hackers</mark>.</p>

              <p>Just going to handwave that one I guess. &#34;It&#39;s secure because.. uh.. miners&#34;. Spoiler: securing technological systems is never that simple.

          <h4>So blockchains are … fancy Google spreadsheets?</h4>
          <p>Sort of! But there are at least three important conceptual differences.</p>
          <p>First, <mark data-annotation-id="1" aria-details="decentralized">a blockchain is decentralized</mark>. It doesn’t need a company like Google overseeing it. <mark data-annotation-id="2" aria-details="computers-on-the-network">All of that work is done by the computers on the network</mark>, using what’s called a consensus mechanism — basically, a complicated algorithm that allows them to agree on what’s in a database without the need for a neutral referee. This makes blockchains more secure than traditional record-keeping systems, <mark data-annotation-id="3" aria-details="more-secure">proponents believe</mark>, since <mark data-annotation-id="4" aria-details="no-single-person">no single person or company can take down the blockchain or alter its contents</mark>, and anyone trying to hack or change the records in the ledger <mark data-annotation-id="5" aria-details="break-into-many-computers">would need to break into many computers simultaneously</mark>.</p>

        <p>
           The second major feature of blockchains is that they’re typically public and open source, meaning that <mark aria-details="unlike-spreadsheet">unlike a Google spreadsheet</mark>, anyone can inspect a public blockchain’s code or see a record of any transaction. (There are private blockchains, but they’re less important than the public ones.)</p>
      </div>
      <div> 
        <div> 
          <p>
             This analogy is really falling apart... you could publish a Google spreadsheet to make it publicly visible too, and whether the blockchain itself is open-source or not is a separate topic to whether it&#39;s a public or private blockchain (there are open-source private blockchains). We also seem to be working up to the suggestion that blockchains are the only reasonable way to verify that data hasn&#39;t changed, which is far from accurate.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div> 
        <p>
           Third, blockchains are typically <mark aria-details="append-only">append-only and permanent, meaning that unlike with a Google spreadsheet, data that’s added to a blockchain typically can’t be deleted or changed after the fact</mark>.</p>

              <p>One could just as easily argue that <i>everyone</i> owns it—everyone has access to your data, including those same tech giants that blockchain proponents usually oppose doing data collection. </p>
              <p>Roose has inadvertently refuted a point that a lot of blockchain proponents fall back on. &#34;In web3 you will own your own data!&#34; No, no one will own it once you put it out there, including you, because you won&#39;t be able to change or delete it.</p>

            <div>

              Well, no, because one it&#39;s not worth anything if it&#39;s not bundled with a million other data points and two, you&#39;re already giving it away for free because anyone can download the chain and run their own chain analysis tools to scrape out whatever they want.

              <p>Yeah. No. No major bank is using permissionless blockchains. Zero. Nada. Nope. <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/project-hamilton-building-a-hypothetical-cbdc">Project Hamilton</a> doesn&#39;t use a blockchain. Any main bank work I have encountered — and I work in this space! — has at the very most been playing with permissioned blockchains, a very very very VERY different beast.

              <p>This is where Roose makes a logical jump. The veracity of a technology doesn&#39;t necessarily correspond to cashflows in an investment. No amount of belief corresponds to a quantifiable amount of inflow of cash into an investment and, as such, this remains a very dubious claim as the basis for an investment thesis.

              <p>Agree, and the fact that Tether is not mentioned a single time in this entire piece, which is the main (highly dubious) conduit for liquidity, should be part of some explanation for why this thing is built on a house of cards.

          <p>Sorry, Cardi. The dollar is the world’s reserve currency, and dislodging it would be a huge, costly project that isn’t likely to happen any time soon.

          <p>“If I live in a community where the police absolutely use eminent domain to claim my private property and I cannot do anything about it,” she wrote, “that sense of everyday powerlessness would make the promise of blockchain sound pretty good.”</p>

           Let’s start with what we know for sure. It’s true that most crypto activity today takes place on blockchains that require large amounts of energy to store and verify transactions. <mark aria-details="proof-of-work">These networks use a “proof-of-work” consensus mechanism</mark> — a process that has been compared to a global guessing game, played by computers all competing to solve cryptographic puzzles in order to add new information to the database and earn a reward in return. Solving these puzzles requires powerful computers, which in turn use lots of energy.</p>

            <div>
              <p>There are: Cardano, Avalanche, and Solana are some of the bigger ones. They are a lot less used, though—although Solana boasts a huge number of transactions per day, around 90% of those are just validators voting among themselves rather than doing anything useful. I think it&#39;s reasonable for him to say most crypto activity takes place on PoW chains.

            <div>
              <p>Also worth pointing out that a bunch of PoS chains (e.g. Polygon) are sidechains to PoW ones anyway so still require the ridiculous power consumption to continue.

            <div>
              
              <p>While this is far from the most dangerous part of Kevin’s formulation of the “truth of crypto,” it is the one that strikes closest to home for me personally. Decentralization as a theoretical tool for empowering artists has been a feature of the advocacy landscape since the arrival of Napster in 1999. It has proven to be both illusory and wildly exploitative. The tools for decentralization—for bypassing gatekeepers, have existed for more than two decades. There is nothing new about crypto to aid in this putative empowerment. The problem that artists confront is that the asset which they create/own has virtually no value given decades of a dominant idea, peddled by many of the same advocates for web3/crypto, that “information wants to be free.” But capacity to individually create and distribute is not synonymous with empowerment when it fails to produce revenue that sustains creators. And don’t get me started on NFTs. NFTs solve none of these problems. Basically, they’re like telling artists—your music isn’t worth anything, but perhaps you can monetize this unique digital collectible. The NFT is a gimmick, not an asset.</p>
              <p>Now it’s all fine and good for Kevin to say that “some proponents will say” that decentralization will empower artists. That’s a true statement. Some people will say that Trump was the greatest president in US history. That is also a true statement of the views of “some people.” But it is beyond irresponsible to fail to interrogate this claim, and the lessons of history in demonstrating its failures.</p>

            <p>It is and always has been possible to do this since the internet started. Artists take commissions and exchange digital assets all the time.

            <p>Artists (to a certain extent) <i>want</i> those &#34;gatekeepers&#34; because they are platforms that bring in an audience or automate some complicated task like inventory management or product hosting.

              <p>In the case of a crypto transaction, it&#39;s incredibly important to add that &#34;sending money&#34; can mean a lot of things, and that you are &#34;sending&#34; it and have to pay to send it, and then once it&#39;s sent, it has to be recorded and depending on how they <i>received</i> it may take more confirmations before you can actually receive the money.</p>

           I was a religion reporter once, and I don’t think the comparison is totally inapt. (It’s also not necessarily a bad thing: <mark aria-details="find-meaning" data-annotation-id="1">Plenty of people find meaning and community and intellectual stimulation in religion.</mark>) As people like the Bloomberg journalist <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/bitcoin-is-a-faith-based-asset-joe-weisenthal">Joe Weisenthal have pointed out,</a> <mark aria-details="cult-2" data-annotation-id="2">crypto has similar elements to an emerging religion: an enigmatic founder (the still-anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto), sacred texts (the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin white paper</a>) and rituals and rites to mark yourself as a believer,</mark> such as tweeting “gm” (crypto speak for “good morning”) to your fellow believers, or photoshopping <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-look-at-the-origins-of-bitcoin-laser-eyes-as-el-salvadors-president-dons-them-2021-06-07">laser eyes</a> onto your profile picture.</p>

            <p>Plenty of people find meaning and community and intellectual stimulation in cults too, I&#39;m sure.</p>
            <div>
              <p>Religion is a system of epistemology. Providing meaning and community is the thing it exists to do. I do not, and should not, expect the same from my bank. If my bank had a fan club, if the Canadian dollar as a concept had a big meetup where everyone was like &#34;woo, the loonie!&#34; and we got musical guests to sing songs about RBC and Scotiabank, that would be insane.
            </p></div>
          </div>
          <p>This would also describe many cults.</p>

           It’s fun to laugh at the (often <a href="https://mashable.com/article/randi-zuckerberg-crypto-parody-music-videos">cringeworthy</a>) ways crypto fans try to entertain and inspire each other. But focusing too much on their behavior and customs might mean missing what’s genuinely novel — and, depending on where you sit, either exciting or dangerous — about the technology itself. Which is why, when my friends ask me how to talk to their cryptopilled relatives, I advise them to start by trying to understand what’s gotten them so excited in the first place.</p>
