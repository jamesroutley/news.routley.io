<subtitle>The layman&#39;s guide to understanding electric guitars and 
tube amplifiers.</subtitle>


</b></i>
<p>By Rob Robinette</p>




<p>Have you ever looked at the guts of a guitar amplifier and 
wondered what all those parts do? Well, I&#39;ll walk you through the signal 
flow and discuss the components in 
this <b>very simple but great sounding 1950&#39;s Fender 5F1 Champ guitar amplifier</b>. Once you 
understand the simple 5F1 you&#39;ll be able to understand more complicated amps. 
5F1 was Fender&#39;s internal model code for the 1950&#39;s tweed Champ. <b>Although 
this page discusses Guitar tube amps everything here applies to audio stereo 
tube amplifiers too</b> with the goal of distortion prevention in audio amps being the 
biggest difference.</p>

<i>Tracing the signal path on this layout diagram and the schematic below

<h2>
Signal Flow Overview</h2>
<p>
Signal flow is shown above and below (orange arrows above, fat red line below). Signal from the guitar enters at 
upper right guitar <b>Input Jack</b> 1 or 2 and flows down to the circuit board 
and then to the preamp tube V1A at bottom right where the signal goes through 
its first stage of amplification. The signal then goes up to the circuit board 
and on to the volume control at top center, then back down to tube V1B (the 
second half of the first tube) for its second stage of amplification. From there 
the audio signal goes back to the circuit board then down to the power tube V2 
for the third stage of amplification. V2&#39;s output goes out the blue wire to the 
output transformer (not shown) for a current boost, then from the output 
transformer via the green wire to the speaker jack (to the right of V2) and on 
to the speaker. I have added component numbers to the layout diagram above that match the schematic below.</p>

The next few paragraphs will help you visualize the flow of electrons through 
simple circuits. Learning to visualize the flow of individual electrons was a 
breakthrough for me in understating tube amplifier electronics.</p>
<p>
<b>Electric guitars generate an alternating current (AC) audio signal</b>. The 
guitar&#39;s <b>pickups</b> are small electric generators. Pickups have magnets 
(poles) that magnetize the metal guitar <b>strings</b>. <b>The movement of 
the magnetic field surrounding the magnetized strings generates electricity in the 
pickup&#39;s coil</b>. The coil is simply a thin insulated wire wrapped around a spool and when a 
magnetic field cuts through a coil of wire it generates an electric 
voltage (electronic pressure) and current (electron flow) in the coil&#39;s wire.</p>
<h2>
Guitar Pickup</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/GuitarPickup.jpg" width="250" height="250"/></p>
<p>
<i>The black and white wires leaving the guitar pickup are the two ends of one long 
coil wire. A humbucker pickup is simply two of these coils connected end-to-end 
(in series).</i></p>

<h2>
Standard Guitar Circuit</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Guitar.jpg" width="400" height="229"/></p>
<p>
<i>The Pickup on the left is a wire coil that generates the guitar signal. The 
Tone Control bleeds high frequencies to ground. The Volume Pot is wired as a variable voltage divider. The Volume Pot bleeds guitar signal to ground to 
lower the guitar&#39;s output volume.</i></p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been asked many times, &#34;<b>What is voltage?</b>&#34; It&#39;s pretty simple 
really. Like electrical charges repel the same way like magnetic poles repel. So 
if you cram a bunch of <b>negatively charged electrons</b> together onto the 
metal plates of a battery their negative charges repel one other--they want elbow 
room. The tighter they are packed together the higher the pressure so I like to 
think of negative voltage as <i><b>electron pressure</b></i>.</p>
<p>
A quick note about &#39;<b>Conventional Current Flow</b>.&#39; In 
electric circuits negatively charged electrons actually flow from the negative 
&#39;-&#39; battery terminal to the positive &#39;+&#39; terminal. That&#39;s right, the electricity 
in your car flows from the battery&#39;s - terminal through the ground wire, through 
the car&#39;s body, through the radio&#39;s ground wire to the radio and then through 
the positive power wire back to the battery. The problem is that Benjamin 
Franklin guessed wrong on the polarity and direction of electrical flow so <i>conventionally</i> 
we think of electricity as flowing from + to -. People say <i>electric current</i> 
flows + to - (conventional current flow) but <i>electrons</i> flow - to +. <b>
With tube electronics it&#39;s easier to think in terms of how the electrons are really moving in order to understand them</b>.</p>
<p>
If you connect a wire across a battery&#39;s terminals the jammed 
together electrons in the negative terminal see the wire as a pipe with lots of room so they flow down 
the wire. <b>When you have an &#39;excess&#39; of electrons tightly packed together you have negative voltage. 
When you have a &#39;scarcity&#39; of electrons, or electrons are pulled apart from one 
another, you have a positive voltage</b>.</p>
<p>
When I 
think about a wire with very high positive voltage on it I imagine the wire as an 
empty 
pipe with very few electrons in it with lots of &#39;elbow room&#39; so electrons really 
want to flow into that wire. Ground or earth represents an unlimited supply of 
electrons at zero volts (or neutral voltage). Touch that high voltage wire wire to a ground and the electrons 
hanging out there will rush in to fill the void of electrons in the wire. <b>
<i><span>Voltage</span></i><span> is the force of electrons wanting to move from a conductor crowded with 
electrons to aÂ  conductor with fewer electrons and more elbow room</span></b>. <b>
<i>Current</i> is the measure of how many electrons are flowing through a 
conductor--the more electrons flowing, the higher the current</b>.
Keep this in mind when thinking about amp circuits, high voltage is an extreme 
scarcity of electrons and <b>ground represents an unlimited supply of electrons.</b></p>
<p>
<b><span>As a guitar string vibrates it moves one way and generates a positive voltage in 
the pickup coil, then as the string reverses direction 
the 
voltage is reversed and a negative voltage is generated</span>. This occurs with every 
string vibration so an alternating current 
(positive-negative-positive-negative. . .) makes up the audio signal put out by 
the guitar</b>. I&#39;ll repeat that because it&#39;s a very important concept, as the 
guitar string moves one direction over the guitar pickup coil it generates a negative 
voltage (excess electrons), then <b>as the string reverses direction the 
electron pressure (voltage) and electron flow (current) 
reverses too</b> and a positive voltage is generated (scarcity of electrons) and 
this repeats with every vibration of the string creating an Alternating Current 
(AC) electrical signal. 
<b>This is why guitar audio signals are AC, or alternating current--as the 
strings alternate their direction of travel the signal voltage alternates 
between + and -. </b>This tiny little AC signal is what the guitar amp will 
amplify until it&#39;s strong enough to move a speaker cone in and out. The speaker 
cone alternates in and out with the alternating current from the guitar&#39;s pickup 
coil. <b><span>For every guitar string movement there is a corresponding speaker cone 
movement</span>.</b></p>
<p>
<b>An AC guitar audio signal on a wire alternates between positive 
and negative voltage. A negative signal voltage packs electrons closer together (excess of electrons = negative voltage). The positive half 
of the AC guitar signal pulls electrons apart and creates a scarcity of electrons. 
Remember, voltage = electron pressure.</b></p>
<p>
If you graph a guitar audio signal the pitch of the guitar string&#39;s sound is expressed as wave spacing 
(frequency) and loudness is expressed as wave height (amplitude). A high 
frequency sound will have tight wave spacing and a low frequency sound will have 
wide wave spacing. In the graph below the high E string is on the left and the 
low E is on the right. A quiet sound will have short waves and a loud sound will 
have tall waves.</p>
<p>
The direct 
relationship between string movement and electricity generated in the pickup 
coil is the key to understanding guitar amplification. Our guitar amplifier will 
simply make the electric audio waves taller to boost their loudness.</p>
<p>
When multiple strings are played 
the multiple electric waves are summed into complex waves. See my 
short youtube video to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd5dgajeIOA&amp;feature=youtu.be">see 
guitar audio on an oscilloscope</a>.</p>

<i>Fender Stratocaster connected directly to an oscilloscope. Each &#39;wave&#39; on the 
oscilloscope is caused by one string vibration. The highest voltage (peak of 
wave) is created by the fastest string speed when it&#39;s moving directly over the 
pickup. The zero voltage point (center of graph) is when the string stops moving 
and reverses its direction. The left side of the graph shows a high 
open E string pluck followed by a pluck of the low open E. Voltage is on the left 
scale and time runs along the bottom. The top half of the signal is positive 
voltage and the bottom half is negative. The signal&#39;s voltage and 
current alternate between positive and negative.  
The tight wave spacing on the left is an indication of high frequency and pitch. The wave height 
is an indication of power and loudness. The high open E + low open E strings&#39; 
signal on the right is a 
summation of the two strings&#39; signals combined into a complex wave--the high 
open E wave is &#39;written&#39; onto the large low open E wave. 
<span> <b>The speaker cone 
will move just like this graph</b></span>. Every little twitch on that line 
makes the speaker cone twitch. When the graph goes high with a positive 
voltage the speaker cone moves outward, when the graph goes low with a negative 
voltage the cone moves inward.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Amplifiers have large capacitors that store enough electricity to <b>kill 
even when the amplifier is unplugged</b>.
If you open an amplifier you MUST verify no voltage remains in the capacitors before 
working inside it. </i></p>

<i>The guitar cable&#39;s tip conductor connects to the input jack&#39;s &#34;T&#34; tip 
terminal. The cable&#39;s sleeve connects to the &#34;G&#34; ground terminal. The guitar signal travels down 
the wire and through grid stopper 
resistor R3.</i></p>
<p>
The guitar&#39;s alternating current audio signal enters the amplifier at guitar 
<b>input jack 1</b> or <b>2</b>. 1 is the Hi input and 2 is the Lo, -6dB quieter input. Resistor 
<b>R1</b> on jack 1 is the &#39;<b>input resistor</b>.&#39; It sets the amp&#39;s input 
impedance to 1,000,000 ohms (1M) to boost the signal voltage from the guitar. 
<SPAN color="#0000FF">[Bonus info: R1 also functions as the &#39;<b>grid leak</b>&#39; resistor 
for Tube V1A&#39;s grid. A grid leak drains off unwanted DC voltage to keep the tube&#39;s 
control grid near 0 DC volts.]</SPAN> The &#39;1M&#39; 
written on R1 is its rating of 1 megaohm. See more on

level information 
on how Fender multiple input jacks and jumpering channels</a> works.</p>
<p>
The signal moves from the 
guitar jacks down the yellow wires to 
resistors <b>R2 </b>or <b>R3</b>, which are &#39;<b>grid stopper</b>&#39; resistors. They help stabilize the 
amplifier by removing much of the audio signal above human hearing. The &#34;68K&#34; 
written on the resistor refers to its resistance value of 68,000 ohms or 68 
kilohms.
<SPAN color="#0000FF">[Bonus info: R2 and R3 also act as &#39;mixing resistors&#39; and 
prevent interaction between two simultaneous inputs like two guitars or a guitar 
and microphone. Sometimes you will see resistor values written as 1K5 which 
simply means 1.5 kilohms.]</SPAN></p>

<i>Signal from resistor R3 travels down the wire to tube V1A&#39;s grid (pin 2) then out 
the plate to coupling capacitor C1. Tube V1 is split into two identical halves, A &amp; B.</i></p>
<p>
After going through grid stopper resistor R3 the audio signal flows down the wire to the 
<b>preamp tube</b>&#39;s control grid, which is the entry to the &#39;A&#39; half of the preamp tube (<b>V1A</b>). 
It&#39;s called V1A because tubes were called &#39;Valves&#39; and this is tube number 
1 and we&#39;re using the &#39;A&#39; half of the tube. 12AX7 is the type of tube which 
happens to be the 
most popular preamp tube in use and it&#39;s really two tubes in one.</p>
<p>
<b>I recommend you now read 
<a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/How_Tubes_Work.htm" target="_blank">How Tubes Work</a> 
and come back here when finished.</b></p>
<p>
The preamp tube amplifies the guitar audio signal then sends it 
out pin 1 (plate) up the yellow wire to capacitor <b>C1</b>, which is a 
<b>&#39;coupling capacitor&#39;</b> or &#39;cap.&#39; Coupling caps are sometimes also called 
&#39;blocking caps&#39; because they block DC voltage but allow the AC guitar signal to 
pass. The 0.022<SPAN face="Arial">u</SPAN>F written on 
the cap is it&#39;s rating of 0.022 microfarads (0.000,000,022 Farads). In some old 
documents you&#39;ll see &#34;micro-micro&#34; or &#34;uu&#34; which means pico 
Farad.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Capacitor_Construction.gif" width="600" height="437"/></p>
<p>
<i>Capacitors are made of two conductive plates separated by an insulator or 
dielectric. Common dielectrics are mica, polypropylene, ceramic and even 
paper and oil.</i></p>
<SPAN size="3">
</SPAN>

<p>
<b>How capacitors block DC but let AC pass</b>: Caps are made with 
sandwiched but separated conductive plates. The separated plates cannot flow DC 
current but AC fluctuates between positive and negative voltage. When the AC 
guitar signal negative voltage (excess electrons) is applied to the input plate 
the electrons repel electrons on the output plate so they move off the plate and 
flow out of the capacitor. When a positive voltage is applied (scarcity of 
electrons) to the input plate the output plate attracts electrons so electrons 
flow into the capacitor.</p>
<p>
That&#39;s how capacitors really work but I like to visualize them 
as having a stretchable rubber membrane inside that blocks the flow of 
electricity. When voltage is applied to a capacitor the &#39;rubber 
membrane&#39; stretches and bulges as electrons try to flow through it. The higher 
the voltage the more the membraneÂ  bulges. If you quickly reverse the 
capacitor&#39;s voltage polarity it will go from bulging one way to bulging the 
other way. This is what a small AC signal does--it stretches the &#39;membrane&#39; back 
and forth as the voltage alternates which allows electrons on both sides of the 
capacitor to move back and forth (alternate) but a constant DC voltage that is trying to flow in one direction will be blocked by the membrane.</p>

<p>
If you are familiar with hydraulics a coupling capacitor is like a piston in a 
hydraulic line. Small alternating pressure changes will make the piston move 
back and forth so fluid is moved on both sides of the piston -- this is how 
small alternating current signals move through a capacitor.</p>
<p>
High voltage DC (direct current) power used by the tube is 
brought in through resistor <b>R5</b>, which is a &#39;<b><a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/How_Tubes_Work.htm#Load_Resistor">load resistor</a></b>.&#39; We&#39;ll 
discuss the function of the load resistor later. The wire between 
tube 
pin 1 (plate) and R5 carries up to 250 volts DC. 
<b>That wire carries both the AC audio signal out and the high voltage DC power the tube 
needs in.</b> Coupling capacitor C1 allows the AC audio signal to pass through 
but blocks the DC on the wire and keeps it out of the volume pot.</p>

<p>
<i>Signal flows from capacitor C1 to the Volume pot then down the orange wire to 
tube V1B&#39;s grid (pin 7) then out the plate (pin 6) to capacitor C2, then to a 
fork in the road--resistor R9 one way and the other way down the yellow wire to the power tube V2.</i></p>
<p>
After going through capacitor C1 the audio signal flows up the yellow wire to the 
<b>volume potentiometer</b> (pot) which acts as a variable voltage divider. Volume knob left = more 
signal bled to ground and lower 
volume. Volume knob right = less signal bled to ground and higher volume. 
<SPAN color="#0000FF">[Bonus info: The volume pot also functions as V1B&#39;s grid leak resistor]</SPAN> 
For more info see <a href="#Voltage_Dividers">voltage dividers and 
potentiometers</a>.</p>
<p>
The signal then flows from the volume pot down the orange 
wire all the way to tube <b>V1B</b>&#39;s pin 7 (grid). V1B is the second half of the preamp tube. 
This second gain stage is called the <b>output stage driver</b> because it 
boosts the signal to the level needed by the power tube. The audio signal leaves 
tube V1B via pin 6 (plate) and flows up the yellow wire to capacitor <b>C2</b>, another coupling cap that blocks DC. 
High voltage DC is fed to the tube via load resistor R7. After C2 the signal 
flows down the yellow wire to the power 
tube&#39;s pin 5 (grid). Resistor <b>R9</b> has a dual function. It adds input impedance to the power tube amplifier circuit 
and acts as the tube&#39;s &#39;grid leak&#39; resistor which keeps the grid at 0 volts DC. </p>

<p>
<i>Signal leaves V2&#39;s pin 3 and flows out the blue wire to the Output Transformer&#39;s primary 
winding then out the secondary winding to the speaker jack.</i></p>
<p>The <b>power tube</b>, <b>V2</b> is sometimes referred to as the 
output 
tube. V2 is the final stage of amplification and its purpose is to amplify for 
power (voltage x current) where V1A and V1B were focused on voltage 
amplification. The signal enters the power tube at pin 5 (grid) and leaves via pin 3 (plate). It then 
goes to the <b><a name="output_transformer">output 
transformer</a> (OT)</b> which is mounted on the backside of the chassis and is not shown on the layout diagram.</p>
<p>Like we saw with the guitar&#39;s pickup, magnetism can be used to 
generate electricity in a coil. You can also do the reverse and pass electricity 
through a coil and generate magnetism. The amplifier&#39;s output transformer uses 
both of these principles to pass alternating current (AC) from its primary 
(input) winding to the iron core as magnetic flux and on to the secondary (output) winding 
as alternating current.</p>
<p>The output transformer&#39;s windings are really just two wire 
coils wrapped around an iron core. The input, or primary winding uses electric current flowing through it to 
generate a magnetic field or flux. This magnetic field fluctuates with the 
guitar AC 
signal voltage and is captured by the transformer&#39;s iron core. The captured 
magnetic flux flowing through the core generates a voltage and current in the secondary 
winding. You can alter the 
voltage and current from primary to secondary by changing the ratio of coil 
wraps from primary coil to secondary.</p>

<p><i>Current flowing into the primary winding (above left) induces 
magnetic flux flow around the transformer iron core which in turn induces an electric 
voltage and current in the secondary winding. Put fewer wire wraps on the secondary (output) winding 
and its voltage will decrease (step down) but its current will increase. Most guitar amp transformers are of the 
&#39;double window&#39; type (bottom of left diagram) and made with laminated iron magnetic cores. 
5F1 transformers are shown on the right. The Power Transformer is lying on its side 
while the Output Transformer is standing vertically. Positioning transformers 90<SPAN face="Arial">º</SPAN> 
out of phase with one another like this reduces interference hum.</i></p>
<p>Example: The primary winding has 200 wraps of wire in its coil 
and the secondary has 100 wraps. If a 10 volt alternating current is applied to 
the primary winding the secondary will generate 1/2 of the input or 5 volts. The 
current will change proportionally in the opposite direction. If 1 ampere of 
AC current is applied to the primary the secondary will generate 2 amps. This is 
what an amplifier&#39;s output transformer does, it steps down the signal&#39;s voltage but steps 
up the current because the speaker&#39;s voice coil needs current to generate a 
magnetic field to move the 
speaker cone.</p>
<p><b>The output transformer&#39;s primary takes in a high voltage, low 
current signal (high impedance signal) and puts out a low voltage, high current signal 
(low impedance signal)</b> through the green wire to the <b>speaker jack</b> and on to the <b>speaker</b>. 
For you mechanical types you can <b>think of the output transformer as a gearbox</b> 
that alters speed (voltage) and torque (current). The power tubes send large 
voltage swing into the output transformer and you can think of this as high 
speed from an &#34;engine&#34;. The transformer gears this high speed (high speed, low 
torque=high voltage, low current) down for much less speed (less voltage swing) 
but much more torque (current).</p>
<p>The 
alternating current audio signal flows 
through the speaker&#39;s <b><a name="voice_coil">voice coil</a></b> which generates a magnetic field. The 
voice coil is simply a single wire wrapped into a coil as shown below. The 
magnetic field created by the voice coil is either attracted to or repelled by 
the speaker&#39;s magnet. Positive 
voltage generates a repulsive magnetic force and the speaker coil and cone moves outward away 
from the speaker magnet, 
negative voltage generates an attractive magnetic force and pulls the speaker 
cone 
inward. <b>The speaker cone <i>alternates</i> between moving outward and inward as 
the signal voltage alternates between positive and negative</b>. <b>For every 
guitar string movement there is a corresponding speaker cone movemen</b>t.</p>
<h2>
Speaker Voice Coil is an Electromagnet</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/coil-magnetic-field.jpg" width="250" height="388"/></p>
<p><i>Electric current flowing through the speaker&#39;s voice coil 
generates a magnetic field. When the electric current in the voice coil reverses, the magnetic 
field also reverses causing attraction and repulsion to the speaker magnet.</i></p>
<p>This 
magnetic attraction and repulsion moves the voice coil and <b>speaker cone</b> back and forth to create air 
pressure waves that our ears perceive as sound--the sweet sound of electric 
guitar. When the speaker cone moves 
outward a positive air pressure wave is created and when the cone moves inward a 
negative (low pressure) wave trough is generated. These air pressure waves move 
our ear drums in and out. The ear drum movement is translated into neuron 
activity which is sent to the brain where pleasure is created, thus electric 
guitar + amp = pleasure ;)</p>
<p><SPAN color="#0000FF"><b>Bonus Info</b>: You can determine the 
ohm rating of a guitar speaker by measuring the DC ohms (resistance) between the 
speaker terminals (while disconnected from the amp) and then multiply by 1.2. 
Example: You measure 6.5 ohms: 6.5 x 1.2 = 7.8 ohms = 8 ohm speaker.</SPAN></p>
<h2>Speaker</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/speaker.jpg" width="400" height="276"/></p>
<p><i>The &#39;voice coil&#39; is an electromagnet that interacts with 
the speaker magnet. The &#39;spider&#39; supports 
the voice coil but allows it to move in and out freely. This excellent
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1870&amp;v=x6CCrLz-Zts">DIY speaker recone 
video</a> shows speaker parts and function in detail.</i></p>
<h2><SPAN color="#0000FF">Bonus Info: How Microphones Work</SPAN></h2>
<p><SPAN color="#0000FF">Dynamic microphones work exactly in 
reverse of how a speaker works. They have a diaphragm like a speaker cone that gets moved by sound (air pressure 
waves). The diaphragm moves a coil of wire wrapped around a magnet. The coil 
moving through the magnetic field creates electricity in the coil wire--an 
alternating current signal voltage.</SPAN></p>
<h2><SPAN color="#0000FF">Microphone</SPAN></h2>
<p>
<SPAN color="#0000FF">
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Microphone.gif" width="381" height="323"/></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN color="#0000FF"><i>When the microphone diaphragm moves the coil, electricity is generated.</i></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN color="#0000FF">When a singer sings a note her vocal chords vibrate like a 
guitar string. The movement of the vocal chords create air pressure waves that 
strike the microphone diaphragm and cause it to move. Speaking of diaphragms, our 
ear drums are diaphragms that when moved by sound waves cause neurons to fire to 
communicate with our brain. Yea, our ears are biological dynamic microphones.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN color="#0000FF">When a positive, high pressure sound wave hits the microphone 
diaphragm it is pushed inward and a positive electrical current and voltage are 
created. When the low pressure wave trough hits the diaphragm it is pulled outward and a negative current and voltage are created in the coil. 
The microphone creates an alternating current voltage signal similar to an 
electric guitar AC voltage signal.</SPAN></p>
<h2>Negative Feedback</h2>
<p>The 5F1 amplifier uses <b>negative feedback (NFB)</b> to reduce 
distortion, increase headroom, decrease damping factor and improve stability but a drawback is it also reduces overall 
amplifier gain. Negative feedback works by taking the speaker output voltage and 
feeding it back into the amp&#39;s signal stream before the driver or phase inverter 
circuit. A feedback resistor reduces the voltage to a suitable level before it 
joins the amp&#39;s signal stream. It&#39;s <i>negative</i> feedback because the signal 
is out of phase so when it&#39;s injected into the amp&#39;s signal stream it reduces 
the amp&#39;s signal voltage.</p>
<p>A green wire running from the 5F1&#39;s speaker jack carries the amplified 
audio signal through resistor R13 and injects 
the feedback at V1B&#39;s pin 8 (cathode). Resistor <b>R13</b> is the Feedback 
Resistor and controls the level of 
feedback voltage passed to the cathode. Adding a switch to the NFB circuit is a common 
modification. Removing feedback makes an amp more aggressive with earlier break up 
and distortion at lower volume levels.</p>
<p><b>So the main purpose of a guitar amplifier is to take the tiny 
AC 
electrical signal generated by the guitar&#39;s pickup coil and make it strong enough to 
push and pull a speaker cone.</b> The guitar amp is also used to shape the tone and 
control signal distortion giving us the clean, mellow sound of jazz guitar 
or the animal growl of hard rock. <b>Distortion is an important part of guitar 
amplifier design and this is the primary difference between guitar and audio 
amplifiers. Audio amps are usually designed for absolute minimum distortion</b>.</p>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve covered the signal flow I&#39;ll go back and cover 
the other amplifier components that I didn&#39;t mention. <b>Wall plug power of 120 volts AC</b> (USA 
or 100, 220 or 240 volts AC in other countries) runs to the <b>fuse</b> F1. 
<b>Fender guitar amp fuses are MDL type &#34;slow blow&#34;</b> or &#34;time 
delay&#34;, size 3AG, 1/4 inch (6mm) wide by 1 1/4 inch (30mm) long. The fuse is a 
250 volt, 2 amp slow blow fuse. Slow blow means it 
won&#39;t blow instantaneously when the turn-on power surge runs through it. 
Sustained current greater than 2 amps is required to blow the fuse. Next the 
power flows to the <b>power switch</b> 
S1, which is located on the volume pot.</p>

<SPAN color="#0000FF">
<i>120 AC volts RMS (average) wall power equals 169.7 volts peak (Vp) and 339.4 volts peak-to-peak 
(Vpp).</i></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN color="#0000FF"><b>Bonus Info:</b> Alternating Current 
(AC) voltage is normally given 
in volts <b>RMS (root-mean-square)</b>, which is a form of voltage averaging 
equal to a DC voltage. Always consider AC voltage as RMS unless it 
is specified as peak Vp or peak-to-peak Vpp. <b>Multimeters show voltage in RMS</b>. 
Our standard 120 volts AC wall power is RMS. You can convert RMS voltage to <b>
peak voltage</b> by multiplying RMS by 1.414, so 120 volts AC at the wall is 
actually 169.7 volts measured from the + wave peak to 0. You can convert peak 
voltage to RMS by multiplying by 0.707. To convert RMS voltage to <b>
peak-to-peak</b> voltage you multiply RMS by 2.828, so 120 volts AC at the 
wall is actually 339.4 volts measured from the + wave peak to the - wave peak. 
You can convert peak-to-peak to RMS by multiplying by 0.354.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN color="#0000FF">AC voltage in the United States runs at 60 cycles per second, which is called 
Hertz (Hz). 120 volt wall power goes from zero to +169.7 volts, then down through zero to 
-169.7 volts, then back up to zero 60 times per 
second. This is why AC electrical noise picked up by guitar amps is often described as 
a 60 Hertz hum. Why is our wall power 60 cycles per second? Because power company electrical 
generators in the US turn at 60 revolutions per second (3600 revolutions per 
minute or RPM).</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN color="#0000FF"><i><b>Bonus Bonus Info:</b> Visualizing 
Alternating Current</i>. One way to visualize how AC electricity flows is to 
think of the amplifier&#39;s power system as a rope and pulley system. Think of the 
wall power plug and the amplifier&#39;s power transformer as pulleys.Â  A loop 
of rope representing the hot and neutral wires would be wrapped tightly around 
the wall power and transformer pulleys.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN color="#0000FF">The power company&#39;s AC generator is like a 
hand grabbing the power rope (hot wire) and pushing it forward a few feet then stopping the 
rope movement and pulling the rope back, then pushing the rope again, then 
pulling it in this alternating pattern (doing one push-pull cycle 60 times per 
second). Electrons actually alternate their movement forward and backward, 
reversing course through AC wires and circuits like this rope movement.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN color="#0000FF"><i><b>Bonus Bonus Bonus Info:</b></i> 240 
volt circuits in the United States use two 120 volt hot wires instead of 120 volt&#39;s single hot wire 
and ground (called neutral). For 240 volts one wire pushes at +120 volts while 
the other pulls at -120 volts (like using two hands, one hand on each of the two ropes in 
the analogy above), then they alternate the pushing and pulling at the same 60 
cycles per second for 240 volts of power. Alright, back to the amplifier. . .</SPAN></p>
<p>After the amp&#39;s fuse and On/Off switch the 120v AC RMS runs to the <b>power 
transformer</b> (PT), through its primary winding, then back to the wall plug 
via the white Neutral wire. <b>The white Neutral wire is a ground wire</b> and 
is connected to the same ground as the Safety Ground wire at the building&#39;s 
electrical service entrance.</p>
<p>The 5F1&#39;s power transformer high voltage winding is 
rated at <b>325-0-325v</b>. This means the transformer has a grounded 0 volt 
center tap and simultaneously puts out +325 volts AC RMS on one secondary 
winding wire and -325v on the other for a 650 volt AC RMS wire-to-wire voltage (<b>650 
volts AC RMS = 1,838 volts peak-to-peak</b> :O ). Yes, that&#39;s high voltage that 
can kill you. At this very high voltage the 5F1 power transformer only needs to 
be rated for a paltry 70 milliamps (0.070 amp) max AC current to run the amp 
circuit.</p>
<p>The power transformer has three secondary windings. The first 
winding as discussed above steps the 120v RMS AC wall power up to 325 volts RMS 
AC. Two other small secondary windings step the 120v AC down to 6.3 volts RMS AC 
and 5 volts RMS AC. Notice all voltages in transformer secondaries are always AC 
because a transformer can&#39;t pass DC from primary to secondary. The 6.3 volts are 
used to power the pilot light and heat the preamp and power tubes&#39; heater 
filaments which heat the tubes&#39; cathodes. The 5 volts are used to directly 
heat the rectifier tube&#39;s cathode.</p>
<p><SPAN color="#0000FF"><i><b>Bonus Info:</b></i> When I first 
learned that the power transformer primary coil was made up of one long wire 
that directly connects the 120v hot wire to the neutral (ground) wire I wondered 
why it didn&#39;t short out. The reason is the primary and secondary coils are 
coupled together by the transformer&#39;s iron core. Alternating current in the 
primary coil creates a magnetic field or flux that is captured by the core. That 
flux in the core creates an AC voltage in the secondary coil. The load 
(impedance) placed on the secondary winding by the amplifier is transferred 
through the core to the primary coil. That impedance keeps the primary coil from 
&#34;shorting out.&#34;</SPAN></p>

<p>
<i>Modern U.S. wall cords and sockets have a narrow blade for <b>Hot </b>(black wire 
120v), a wide blade for <b>Neutral</b> (white wire ground), and a round or &#39;D&#39; shaped 
prong for the chassis <b>Safety Ground</b> (green wire ground). Power cord wire colors are sometimes 
non-standard so use a multimeter to identify Hot and Neutral. Europeans 
sometimes use the letters <b>E: Earth</b> (safety ground), <b>L: Line</b> (hot) 
and <b>N: Neutral</b> to describe the three plug wires.</i></p>
<p>The 325 volts AC power from the <a name="power_transformer">
power transformer</a> is fed directly into <b>V3</b>, the <b> <a href="#rectifier_tube">rectifier 
tube</a></b>. V3 is a full wave dual plate rectifier tube that converts 
alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). The power transformer and rectifier 
work together as an electron 
pump which pulls electrons out of the amp circuit creating a positive voltage 
(electron scarcity = positive voltage). The amplifier&#39;s 
electronics need DC to amplify. <b>The amp is powered by DC but the 
guitar signal moving through the amp is AC.</b></p>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/5F1_Power_Flow.png"/></p>
<p><i>The flow of power starts at the power transformer at far 
left. 325V AC on each high voltage secondary wire powers the V3 rectifier tube. V3 puts out 360V of DC. Note the 
yellow wires running to V1&#39;s pins 1 &amp; 6 carry both high voltage DC power into 
the tube and the AC signal out (orange arrows). This diagram shows &#34;conventional&#34; 
current flow but 
the actual electrons flow in the opposite direction.</i></p>
<p>360 volts of DC flows out of V3&#39;s pin 8 (cathode) and is referred to 
as <b>B+ </b>voltage (from old Battery Positive designation). Tube 
rectifiers are popular in guitar amps due to their dynamic power sag which adds 
to the amp&#39;s playing dynamics and note &#34;bloom&#34;. Audio stereo tube amps usually use 
solid state rectifiers to reduce voltage sag that would be seen as distortion to 
the Hi Fi listener.</p>
<p>The B+ DC voltage flows to the output transformer&#39;s primary winding and 
to the circuit 
board&#39;s three large <b>filter/reservoir capacitors</b>, <b>C3, C4</b> and <b>C5 
and two voltage dropping resistors, R10 &amp; R11</b>. These 
resistors and capacitors form RC (resistance capacitance) low pass filters that 
take the lumpy, pulsing DC output of the rectifier tube and smooth it out--the 
smoother the better.Â Any waves or ripples left over in the DC power 
would be added to our audio signal and heard as hum in the preamp and power 
tubes. These big capacitors also function as current reservoirs that help feed 
the amp during high demand. The hydraulic equivalent of a filter capacitor is a 
hydraulic accumulator. The &#39;16<SPAN face="Arial">µF </SPAN>475V&#39; written on the cap is its rating of 16 
micro Farads and 475 volts. The &#39;10K 2W&#39; written on resistor R10 is its rating of 10,000 ohms and 2 
watts. Here&#39;s an online
<a href="https://www.ampbooks.com/mobile/amplifier-calculators/RC-ripple-filter/">
RC Ripple Filter Calculator</a>.</p>
<p>The voltage dropping resistors separate the amp&#39;s power into 
three power supply nodes, B+1, B+2 and B+3.Â  The 360 volts DC from the 
rectifier is B+1 then it&#39;s stepped down to 325 volts DC 
(<b>B+2</b>) then to 250 
volts DC (<b>B+3</b>). The 360 volts DC B+1 direct from the rectifier is fed to the output transformer&#39;s primary input which flows on to the power 
tube plates. The 325 volts DC B+2 is connected to the power tube pin 4--the screen grid. The 250 
volts DC B+3 is used to power the preamp tube. The filter capacitors and voltage 
dropping resistors also decouple the three B+ power nodes to prevent 
interaction, feedback and oscillation between the preamp stages and power tube. With no guitar signal present the &#39;idle&#39; voltage at the 
V1 preamp tube&#39;s plate pins 1 and 6 will be around 170 volts DC after flowing 
through the <b>Load Resistors</b> R5 and R7.</p>
<h2><a name="How_Chokes_Work">How Chokes Work</a></h2>
<p>Although the Champ does not use a choke many amps do use them to 
filter the power supply. Typically the choke is placed between the power tube 
plate and power tube screen power nodes. This is done as a cost savings measure. 
A choke would have to be very large and expensive to filter the entire power 
supply for a 50 or 100 watt amplifier.</p>
<p><b>When electrical current flows through a wire it creates a 
magnetic field around the wire. Chokes are inductors that use this magnetic 
field to reduce changes in voltage and current.</b> When no current flows 
through a wire (you can have voltage but no current) there is no magnetic field 
generated around the wire. When current increases some of the current will be 
used to grow a magnetic field around the wire. When current decreases the 
magnetic field shrinks and the magnetic energy is converted into electrical 
current. These inductor properties &#34;fight&#34; current changes.</p>
<p>A choke is simply one long wire wound in many loops. A choke 
will have two leads which are simply the two ends of the one long wire. The wire 
is usually looped around an iron core which makes it work better. Looping the 
wire increases the effect of the induced magnetic field (&#34;inductor&#34; comes from 
the word &#34;induced&#34;).</p>
<p>When power supply voltage ripple flows through a choke, the 
choke &#34;fights&#34; the ripple. As ripple voltage increases, ripple current increases 
through the choke. The choke will convert some of the current increase into a 
magnetic field. The choke&#39;s magnetic field is stored energy. As the power supply 
ripple voltage decreases the choke&#39;s magnetic field collapses and converts into 
current. So increasing voltage and current are cut, and decreasing voltage and 
current are reinforced which reduces the amplitude of voltage ripple.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Small_Inductor.jpg" height="427"/></p>
<p><i>This simple looped wire is a small air core inductor.</i></p>
<p>Inductors in AC circuits work the same way. Inductance &#34;fights&#34; 
changes in current and AC audio signals are made up of voltage and current 
changes. A small inductor can remove high frequencies. A larger value inductor 
can remove medium and high frequencies. A very high value inductor, like the 
choke in power supplies, can remove all audio frequencies.</p>
<h2><a name="Amp_Total_Power_Usage">Amp Total Power Usage</a></h2>
<p>How is it that the 5F1 Champ uses 0.75 amps of 6.3 volt current, 
2 amps of 5 volt current and 42ma of high voltage current and yet it uses a 2 
amp fuse? It&#39;s due to power conversion.</p>
<p><b>This is the power conversion for the 5F1 Champ</b></p>
<p>Â Â Â  First we will convert the current from amps 
to watts:</p>
<p>Â Â Â  The Champ&#39;s 5Y3 rectifier tube datasheet 
shows it uses 2 amps of 
5v heater current: 2a x 5v = 10 watts (this is also be called 10 VA)</p>
<p>Â Â Â  The 6V6GT power tube datasheet shows it 0.45 amps of 6.3v 
heater current: 0.45a x 6.3v = 2.835 watts</p>
<p>Â Â Â  The 12AX7 datasheet shows it uses 0.3 amps of 6.3v heater 
current: 0.3a x 6.3v = 1.89 watts</p>
<p>Â Â Â  The amp uses 42ma of high voltage DC.</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We have a typical 19v 
drop across the 470 ohm power tube cathode resistor: 19v / 470 = 40ma</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We have a 1.5v drop 
across both of the 12AX7 cathode resistors: 1.5v / 1.5k = 1ma each, 2ma total</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  42ma x 370v = 15.5 watts</p>
<p>Â Â Â  Total the watts: 10w + 2.835w + 1.89w + 
15.5w = <b>30.225 watts of power used by the power transformer secondaries</b>.</p>
<p>Â Â Â  Now we convert the secondary watts to primary 
watts:</p>
<p><b>Â Â Â  If our mains voltage is 125 volts then 
30.225w / 125v = 0.24 amps of mains current. We can estimate that the 
transformer looses about 10% for a total of 0.26 amps,Â  so a 2 amp fuse has 
a lot of headroom for turn-on power surge.</b></p>
<p><b>Â Â Â  If our mains voltage is 240 volts then 
30.225w / 240v = 0.13 amps + 0.01 amp efficiency loss for a total of 0.14 amps, so 
a 1 amp fuse could be used.</b></p>
<p>Well that&#39;s it for the 5F1 Champ. It&#39;s a great sounding but 
simple guitar amp. The signal flow is very similar to most other Fender 
amps, they just have more parts. Really understanding the 5F1 will help you 
understand other more complex amps.</p>

<h2>A Note On Amplifier Gain</h2>
<p><b>The more gain an amplifier offers up the more likely it is to 
oscillate and hum</b>. That&#39;s why many high gain amps have &#34;extra&#34; high 
frequency filtering plate load bypass caps, DC preamp heater voltage, shielded signal cable and 
&#34;stability&#34; caps across the phase inverter plates. Component placement, lead 
dress (wire length and placement) and power filtering all become more critical. 
Higher gain amps can take what would be an acceptable level of noise and amplify 
it to the point the amp is unusable. If you build a high gain kit amp you can 
expect to spend some time troubleshooting hum and noise issues until you get the 
kinks out--you&#39;ve really got to pay attention to lead dress, especially around 
the first couple of gain stages.</p>

<h2>Tube Bias Circuits</h2>
<h2>
5F1 Cathode Bias</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/5F1_Cathode_Bias.png"/></p>
<p><i>The 5F1&#39;s V1 and V2 use &#34;common cathode biasing&#34;, also 
referred to as &#34;self biasing&#34; or just &#34;cathode biased.&#34; V1A&#39;s bias voltage is 
set by cathode resistor R4 which is connected to V1A&#39;s cathode (pin 3). V1B&#39;s 
bias is set by R6. V2&#39;s bias is set by R8. Capacitor C6 is a cathode bypass cap 
that helps decrease local feedback and increase V2&#39;s gain. Although not shown on 
the original 5F1 Champ Fender schematic and layout, most 
Champs came from the factory with the C7 cathode bypass capacitor shown at 
extreme right. The bypass cap boosted the amp&#39;s gain. For Champs without the C7 
bypass cap adding one is a common and recommended 
modification.</i></p>
<p>For the tube&#39;s control grid to control the flow of electrons 
between the cathode and plate there must be a voltage difference between the cathode and 
control grid. The voltage difference is what repels the electrons to control 
their flow. The cathode is &#39;boiling off&#39; 
negatively charged electrons and a more negatively charged control grid can keep 
them in place because like charges repel. <b>This voltage difference between the cathode and control grid 
is called tube &#39;bias.&#39;</b> Common cathode tubes use the voltage drop across a 
cathode resistor placed 
between the cathode and ground to generate the bias voltage.</p>
<p>The much more powerful 5E3P amplifier shown below uses an &#34;<b>adjustable fixed bias</b>&#34; system to 
supply the bias voltage. It is called &#34;fixed bias&#34; because a steady bias voltage 
is applied to the tube control grid. A cathode biased amp&#39;s bias voltage will 
fluctuate with the input signal (it&#39;s not fixed). A fixed bias amp applies a 
negative voltage (usually between -35 to -50 volts DC) to the power tubes&#39; 
control grids and the cathodes 
are connected directly to ground at zero volts (there is no cathode resistor). 
Power tubes have a maximum heat dissipation rating given in watts. Exceed this 
limit and you can melt the tube. Setting a tube&#39;s bias for a higher % of maximum  
dissipation is considered a hotter bias. The power tube grid voltage is always 
negative on fixed bias amps and a hotter bias will have the grid voltage closer 
to zero. A hot bias for the 5F6A <i>Bassman</i> would be around -44V DC. Setting 
a lower % of max dissipation is considered a cooler bias and the grid voltage 
will be a larger negative number like -50V. See this for info on How to <b>
<a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/How_to_Bias_a_Tube_Amp.htm">Measure and Adjust Bias</a></b>.</p>
<h2>Adjustable Fixed Bias System</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/adjustable_fixed_bias.jpg"/></p>
<p><i>Power Transformer on left supplies 50 volts AC to the 
Rectifier Diode. The AC power flows into the diode&#39;s negative terminal (cathode) 
so 50 volts of pulsing <b>negative DC</b> flows out. The 1K resistor and large 
50uF Filter Capacitor 
form an RC (resistance capacitance) low pass filter to smooth out the DC pulses. 
The Bias Adjustment Pot adjusts the amount of 
negative DC voltage that flows to the Power Tubes&#39; Control Grids. The 27K resistor sets 
the maximum hot bias, reduce it for hotter max bias, increase it for cooler.</i></p>

<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/65_Deluxe_Reverb_Gain.jpg" height="1124"/></p>
<p>
<i>A 1kHz 37 millivolt sine wave (AC) audio signal is injected at a 65 Deluxe 
Reverb Normal and Vibrato channels&#39; Hi 
input jack (upper left) with all the volume and tone pots set to a half turn. The 1kHz audio 
signal path through the amp is highlighted and each stage&#39;s gain factor is shown 
in red with an &#34;x&#34;. Yellow ovals list the audio signal voltage.</i></p>
<p>
The 1kHz AC sine wave test signal measures 37 millivolts AC RMS (root-mean-square average) at the V1A 
(Normal channel) and V2A (Vibrato channel) grids.</p>
<p>
V1A and V2A amplify the 37mv AC signal 
on their grids to 1.6 VAC (volts AC) at their plates. This is a voltage increase 
(voltage gain or gain factor) of 43 times (.037v x 43 = 1.6v).</p>
<p>
The tone stack and volume control load the AC signal down from 1.6 VAC at the 
V1A and V2A plates to 47mv AC at the V1B and V2B grids. V1B and V2B amplify the 
47mv signal 57 times to 2.7 VAC (gain factor of 57).</p>
<p>
The Vibrato channel&#39;s signal off the V2B plate is attenuated by the reverb 
circuit from 2.7 VAC down to 115 millivolts AC at the V4B grid. V4B amplifies 
the Vibrato channel signal 33 times. One explanation for the lower gain factor 
of this stage is the load 
applied to the plate from the tremolo circuit. Disconnecting this load with a 
&#34;tremolo off&#34; mod will significantly boost the Vibrato channel&#39;s gain.</p>
<p>
<b>We can see the extra gain provided by the Vibrato channel when we compare the 3.8 VAC at its 
220k mixing resistor with the 2.7 VAC at the Normal channel mixing resistor. 
The Vibrato channel puts out 47% more gain than the Normal channel at this 
volume setting due to the extra V4B gain stage.</b></p>
<p>
The schematic shows 5.3 peak-to-peak volts on the V6A upper phase inverter grid. 
5.3vpp equals 1.9 VAC RMS (assumes an 
undistorted sine wave).</p>
<p>
With 1.9 VAC on the phase inverter upper grid and an output at the plate 
of 22 VAC we get an 11.6x gain. The phase inverter lower triode (V6B) plate is at 
23 VAC for a 12.1x gain. Note the 82k plate load resistor on the upper phase 
inverter triode and 100k on the lower. 82k was used to lower the gain to balance 
the phase inverter output but 82k is actually a little too low for an exact 
balance. We can add the two triodes&#39; gain together to get the 
total phase inverter gain of 23.7x. Note that each phase inverter triode&#39;s gain factor is only about 25% 
of a normal triode 
gain stage. Also note the audio signal travels from the phase inverter upper triode 
to the lower triode through their interconnected cathodes. The 1.9 peak-to-peak 
volt signal shown on the lower phase inverter grid is the negative 
feedback signal.</p>
<p>
<b>While the previous gain stages are voltage amplifiers the power tubes amplify 
power, meaning voltage and current</b>.
The schematic doesn&#39;t show power tube grid voltage so we&#39;ll ignore the signal 
loss caused by the 220k grid leak resistors and assume 22 and 23 VAC on the power tube grids for a 
7.9 and 7.6x gains to 174 VAC. Each power tube puts out 174 VAC between one half of the transformer primary 
to the center tap so there is 348 VAC total across the transformer 
primary so the power tubes&#39; total gain factor is 15.5. Remember the power tubes 
are amplifying both voltage and current so their contribution to overall gain is 
higher than the voltage gain number suggests.</p>
<p>
The output transformer steps <b>down</b> the 348 VAC primary 
voltage to 11 VAC at the secondary (and speaker jack) for a -31.6x signal voltage 
reduction <b>but</b> the signal&#39;s current is stepped <i><b>up</b></i> by the output transformer 31.6 
times (current gain factor of 31.6). The output transformer matches the high impedance audio signal (high 
voltage but low current) from the power tubes with the low impedance signal (low 
voltage but high current) needed by the speaker coil.</p>
<h2>
Vibrato Channel Gain Chain</h2>
<p>
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  37mv audio signal in -&gt; V2A 43x -&gt; 
V2B 57x -&gt; V4B 33x -&gt; Phase Inverter 23.7x -&gt; Power Tubes 15.5x -&gt; Output Transformer -31.6x -&gt; 11 VAC out</p>
<p>
With the volume pots set at 1/2 we get 11 VAC into an 8 ohm speaker which yields 
15 watts. The amp is rated at 22 watts with 5% total harmonic distortion with 
the Normal channel volume pot at max.</p>
<p>
<b>Note the gain factors of each stage are not additive because there are signal 
voltage losses between gain stages</b>. If there were no losses between stages 
in the Vibrato channel 
and no loss to overdrive a 37mv signal into 
the amp would yield 65.5 VAC and 536 watts at the speaker jack!</p><hr/>


<p>Amplifier rectifiers can use tubes or solid state diodes to 
rectify alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). They do this by 
acting as one-way valves that only allow electrons to flow in one direction.</p>
<p>Solid state rectifiers (silicone diodes) are known as sounding 
stiff and punchy because they don&#39;t create as much voltage drop and sag as tube 
rectifiers which can have over 60 volts of voltage drop across them.</p>
<p><b>Voltage drop</b> is caused by the internal resistance of the 
power transformer and rectifier. It lowers the amp&#39;s B+ voltage and can soften 
the dynamics of an amplifier where the higher voltage provided by solid state 
rectifiers can make an amp sound punchier, louder and offer up a tighter lower 
end and overdrive tone. Solid state rectifiers typically drop only 2 volts and a GZ34 tube 
rectifier drops around 15. The 5Y3 offers up 60 volts of drop.</p>
<p><b>Voltage sag</b> is the dynamic voltage drop across the 
rectifier that increases with current demand and creates output volume 
compression. Output volume compression occurs because high current demand during 
loud notes lowers the amps B+ voltage and maximum volume is decreased. 
Conversely, low demand, quiet passages create less voltage sag and generate 
greater amplification. This makes loud notes quieter and quiet notes louder 
which equals compression. Class A and AB amps differ in how much voltage sag is 
generated. Since Class A amplifiers idle near max current there are less current 
demand fluctuations and therefore less voltage sag. Voltage drop and sag help 
contribute to the warm, round, tubey sound of vintage amplifiers. The 
combination of the 5E3 <i>Deluxe&#39;s</i> small power transformer, 5Y3 rectifier tube and 
Class AB operation lead to metric shit tons of voltage sag.</p>

<p>A single diode or single plate rectifier tube is a <b>half wave 
rectifier</b> because only half of the AC wave is converted into DC voltage. Many fixed bias power supplies use a single diode half wave rectifier 
to generate the power tube bias voltage. Silicone diodes are similar to single plate rectifier tubes in 
that both have one cathode and one anode (plate is another name for a tube&#39;s anode). The 
term &#34;diode&#34; means two electrodes (cathode and anode). Tubes with two electrodes 
are also called diodes.</p>

<p>
<i>50V AC is tapped off the power transformer and sent to 
a <b>single diode</b>. It acts as a one-way valve to convert the 60Hz AC into 
60Hz pulsing negative DC voltage. The DC out voltage is negative because of the 
polarity of the diode (turning the diode around would provide positive DC 
voltage). With the diode&#39;s cathode connected to the AC power 
source, negative DC is created. The bias circuit uses the power transformer&#39;s 
grounded center tap as the current return path.</i></p>

<p>
<i>60Hz AC in and 60Hz pulsing negative DC out. Half wave rectification is inefficient 
because it only converts half of the AC wave. It generates very lumpy DC power 
which is smoothed using resistors and large capacitors that form a 
resistance-capacitance (RC) low pass filter.</i></p>
<p>Two diodes, or a standard dual plate rectifier tube such as the 
5Y3 or GZ34, are <b>conventional full wave rectifiers</b>. They are &#34;full wave&#34; 
rectifiers because both the positive and negative AC wave are converted into DC 
voltage. <b>Conventional rectifiers 
require a power transformer center tap to provide a DC current return path from the 
amp circuit back to the transformer</b>.</p>

<p>Four diodes can be used to create a full wave <b>bridge rectifier</b> 
which <b>does not need a power transformer center tap.</b> A bridge rectifier 
is very efficient and extracts almost twice the voltage from an AC supply as a 
conventional rectifier.</p>

<p>
<i>All four diodes in a bridge rectifier act as one-way valves that allow current to flow in only one 
direction. T<b>he two diodes on the left side form the &#39;bridge&#39; from the amp circuit 
back to the power transformer so a center tap is not required</b>. As the outflow of 
current (shown with orange arrows) is &#39;pushed&#39; by the transformer, the return 
path (shown with blue arrows) is simultaneously &#39;pulled&#39; by the transformer&#39;s 
negative voltage so a bridge rectifier can extract twice the voltage of a 
conventional two diode rectifier which only &#39;pushes&#39; because the transformer 
center tap is grounded at zero volts and does not pull.</i></p>
<h2>
Bridge Rectifier Current Flow During Negative Half of AC Wave</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Bridge_Rectifier_bottom.jpg" width="480" height="416"/></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: All diagrams in this <i>All About Rectifiers</i> 
section show <b>conventional current flow</b> when in reality to create a 
positive voltage electrons must be removed from a conductor (+ voltage = 
scarcity of electrons, - voltage = excess of electrons).</p>
<p><b>All rectifiers must have a DC current return path back to the power 
transformer</b> because the rectified DC flows in only one direction--away from the 
transformer. <b>The transformer center tap or rectifier bridge provides the  
current return path back to the transformer</b>.</p>
<p><b>Although a bridge rectifier will extract twice the voltage 
from a transformer compared to a conventional rectifier, a bridge rectifier will only 
supply 62% the rated current at that higher voltage</b>. If you tape off the center tap of a power transformer 
and replace a conventional rectifier with a bridge rectifier it will generate 
twice the voltage but the winding wires would have to be of a heavier gauge to 
generate the same current.</p>
<h2>Predict Amp Idle DC Voltage</h2>
<p>

<p><i>This chart is from the 5Y3 tube rectifier datasheet and 
shows predicted DC voltage when using a B+ filter cap (there is another chart 
for chokes). If we know the power transformer high voltage output and the amp&#39;s 
DC current draw the chart will show the rectifier B+ output voltage. <b>The 5F1 
Champ uses 42 milliamps of DC current and a 325-0-325v high voltage secondary so 
we enter the chart at the bottom at 42ma and go up to find the 325v chart curve 
and move left to find the rectifier output DC volts under load of 370 volts</b>. 
The <b>no-load</b> B+ voltage is equal to the high voltage secondary peak 
voltage:Â  325v * 1.41 = 458 peak volts (1.41 is equal to the square root of 
2) so with the power and preamp tubes pulled (no load on the rectifier) you 
would expect to measure 458 volts DC at the first filter cap.</i></p>

<h2>Why Center Tapped Transformers Don&#39;t Need a Bridge  
Rectifier</h2>
<p>This bothered me for a long time until I did enough research to 
understand the current flow through 2 diode (conventional) and 4 diode (bridge) 
rectifiers.</p>
<p>Why does a power transformer with a center tap allow 
rectification with just two diodes versus four needed with no center tap? 
Because the transformer center tap provides the path for returning current to 
the transformer. If you use a 
transformer without a center tap then a 4 diode bridge rectifier is needed to 
provide the DC current return path from the amp circuit back to the transformer.</p>

<i>With no center tap there&#39;s no return path to the transformer so this will not 
work.</i></p>

Hybrid Rectifier With No Center Tap</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/5E3P_Build/Hybrid-Rectifier.gif" width="303" height="178"/></p>
<p>
<i><b>To use a transformer with no center tap with a tube rectifier you can install 
the &#39;bridge half&#39; of a bridge rectifier to provide a current return path</b>. Two 
1N4007 diodes running from the tube plate pins to ground will do the trick. 
Diode polarity is important, install the diodes with their stripes (cathodes) to the tube 
plates.</i></p>

<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/5E3P_Build/Hybrid_Rectifier_With_Backup.gif" width="287" height="193"/></p>
<p>
<i>The two diodes connected to the tube plates are soft fail protection &#39;backup&#39; diodes 
that will prevent AC from entering the amp if the tube fails as a short circuit. 
This is the equivalent of a bridge rectifier feeding a tube rectifier.</i></p>
<p>
<b>The 6.3v filament heater circuit is different from the high voltage circuit 
in that the 6.3v circuit can function fine without a center tap</b>. The 6.3v center 
tap is not used as a current return path, its only used as a zero volt reference to 
balance the voltage of the two heater wires and set a stable voltage difference 
between the heaters and tube cathodes. Keeping the two heater wire voltages the 
same helps with twisted wire hum cancellation. Since the heater circuit is AC 
and is not converted to DC both 6.3v wires act as &#34;send&#34; and &#34;return&#34; wires. In these 
purely AC wires the electrons flow back and forth in both lines so a separate 
return line isn&#39;t needed.</p><hr/>
<h2>
Amplifier <a name="Grounding_Schemes">Grounding Schemes</a></h2>
<p>
The key to understanding grounding schemes is to realize <b>the ground is the 
source for all the DC electrons 
flowing through the amp</b>. That&#39;s right, the power supply pumps electrons out 
of the amp circuit creating a scarcity of electrons we measure as a positive 
voltage. Electrons are pulled out of the ground to replace the ones removed by 
the power supply. Conventionally we think of <b><i>DC current</i></b> flowing 
from the power supply through the circuit to ground but in actuality the <i><b>
DC electrons</b></i> are flowing the opposite direction. For amp&#39;s using a 
conventional rectifier the DC current must 
return to the power transformer center tap. For amps using a bridge rectifier the current must 
return to the rectifier bridge (see the <a href="#Rectifiers">Rectifier section</a> 
for more detail on this).</p>
<p>

<p>
<i>Arrows show flow of ground current back to the power transformer center tap.</i></p>
<p>
<b>The Split Grounding Bus Bar</b></p>
<p>
Splitting the power amp and preamp grounds is currently (no pun intended) the 
most popular grounding scheme used by amateur amp builders. By far most of the 
amp&#39;s B+ current is used up by the power tube plates so we want a nice &#34;loop&#34; 
from power transformer, to rectifier, to B+1 filter cap, 
through the output transformer to power tube plates, to power tube cathode &amp; 
resistor and back to the power transformer through its center tap. That loop needs a ground reference 
connection to reduce hum so we bolt the center tap to the chassis but no current 
should flow into the chassis--it flows through the loop from the transformer, 
through the amp circuit and 
back to the transformer.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/5E3P_Build/5e3_Deluxe_Amp_Layout.png">
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/5E3P_Build/5e3_Deluxe_Amp_Layout_small.png"/></a></p>
<p>
<i>Note the split &#34;Power Amp Ground Bus&#34; and &#34;Preamp Ground Bus&#34; 
running along the top of the circuit board in this 5E3 
Deluxe layout. The power amp is connected to the chassis to the right and above 
the power transformer. The preamp is connected to the chassis at the upper 
right input jack.</i></p>
<p>
Since the power tube screens are part of the power amp we usually connect the 
B+2 (power tube screens) filter cap to the same power amp chassis ground 
point--but again the current is flowing in a loop through the screen resistors 
back to the power transformer.</p>
<p>
The B+3 (preamp) filter cap provides power to the rest of the amp and its 
current must also make its way back to the power transformer center tap by way 
of the ground connection at the input jack. So <b>the preamp&#39;s DC current must 
flow through the chassis from the input jack to the power transformer&#39;s center 
tap</b>. We do it this way to try to prevent interaction between the high 
current power amp and low current preamp but eddy 
currents in the steel or aluminum chassis can add noise and hum. Electrical 
engineers will tell you that flowing ground current through the chassis is a bad 
idea. I agree but this split bus works fine in low gain amplifiers like the 
Fender Tweed, blackface and silverface amps.</p><hr/>
<h2>
Actual DC Electron Flow Through the 5E3</h2>
<p>
The actual flow of electrons is opposite the direction of conventional current 
because Benjamin Franklin guessed wrong on the direction of electrical flow.</p>
<h2>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/5E3_Electron_Flow_Schematic.bmp"/></h2>
<p>
<i>Gray arrows show the actual DC electron flow through the amp (flows negative 
to positive) which is opposite of &#34;conventional&#34; current direction. <b>Electrons 
flow from the power transformer center tap to chassis 
ground to all the tube cathodes</b>. DC electron flow is very slow and takes about 170 hours to make a 600 inch loop around an amp circuitÂ which includes half the 
length of the power transformer secondary winding and half of the output 
transformer primary due to their center taps. Don&#39;t believe this? See
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_velocity">electron drift velocity</a>

The other three input jacks and speaker jacks must be isolated from the 
chassis and connected to the ground bus. DC electrons flow in a circular motion 
starting at the power transformer center tap around the amp.</i></p>
<p>
Electron flow starts with the black Hot and white Neutral power cord wires at 
far left. Electrons alternate moving back and forth under AC voltage. They 
really don&#39;t move so much as vibrate or wiggle because they only move about .00001 inch 
each AC cycle. These wiggling electrons in the power 
transformer primary winding induce AC electron wiggle in the transformer 
secondary. The high AC voltage from the power transformer secondary tries to push and 
pull electrons to the rectifier tube but the rectifier acts as a one-way valve 
that only allows the wiggling electrons to move in one direction so electrons 
are pulled out of the rectifier&#39;s cathode into the transformer.</p>
<p>
<b>So the transformer and rectifier act as an electron pump that pulls electrons 
out of the B+ wire connected to the rectifier&#39;s cathode at pin 8</b>. Pulling 
electrons out of the B+ wire creates a positive DC voltage (scarcity of 
electrons = positive voltage). Although the power transformer puts out an AC 
voltage, the only current flowing through the high voltage secondary is DC--the 
electrons flowing from the rectifier to the transformer center tap. For amps 
with bridge rectifiers, which do not need a transformer center tap, there will 
be AC current flowing in the high voltage secondary. See the
<a href="#Rectifiers">Rectifier section</a> for more info on how conventional 
and bridge rectifiers work.</p>
<p>
The electrons pulled out of the B+ wire flow through the power transformer&#39;s 
high voltage secondary leads and out its grounded center tap to the ground bus 
bar. <b>The center tap is the source of all DC electrons that flow through the 
amp</b> (the guitar signal is AC). Most of the amp&#39;s electrons will flow from 
the ground bus through the power tube cathode resistor and on to the power tube 
cathodes. Then they flow out the plates and through the output transformer 
primary then to the B+1 power node, standby switch and back to the rectifier 
tube for a complete &#34;lap&#34; around the amp. <b>During the amp&#39;s operation 
electrons are constantly making this circular trek around the amp</b>. Electrons 
captured by the power tube screen flow to the B+2 node and on to the rectifier. 
Electrons also flow through the preamp tubes&#39; cathodes and out their plates to 
the B+3 wire and back to the rectifier.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Big Picture Amp Power</h2>
<p>The electric company&#39;s generators (spinning at 60Hz = 60 
revolutions per second = 3600 revolutions per minute) push and pull electrons 
(alternating current or AC) through wires to your wall socket. You connect your 
amp&#39;s power transformer primary winding to the wall socket and electrons are 
pushed and pulled through the winding. The transformer&#39;s iron core captures the 
magnetic field (flux) generated by the primary winding and induces a stepped up higher 
voltage AC in the secondary winding. The secondary winding is connected to the 
5Y3 rectifier&#39;s two plates. Every AC half cycle one 
plate is charged positive (scarcity of electrons) while the other plate is 
charged negatively (excess electrons). The negatively charged plate does nothing 
while the positively charged plate pulls electrons from the cathode and the B+ 
supply 
wire attached to it (removing electrons from the B+ wire creates a positive 
voltage).</p>

<p>During the next AC half cycle voltage on the two plates is 
reversed. One plate is charged 
positive and pulls electrons from the cathode while the other plate does 
nothing. Because the 5Y3 has two plates and pulls electrons during both halves of the AC cycle it 
is a &#39;full wave&#39; rectifier and because it only &#39;pulls&#39; electrons they flow in 
only one direction which makes the current DC (direct current). A rectifier with 
just one plate and cathode would only pull electrons during half the AC cycle so 
it would be a half wave rectifier. The single diode in bias power supplies is a half 
wave rectifier.</p>

<p>
<i>The 5F6A Bassman is a truly classic amp. Major differences from the 5E3 
Deluxe include a tone stack with bass, treble and mid controls and a tone stack 
buffer (V2B) just before the tone stack. The long tail pair phase inverter adds 
gain and helps drive the big 5881 fixed bias power tubes into full distortion. The amp also came 
with much larger value filter/reservoir caps to drive the lows from a bass guitar. <b>Click on

How Cathode <a name="Bypass_Capacitors">Bypass Capacitors</a> Work</h2>
<h2>
Cathode Bypass Cap C5</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Bypass_Cap.jpg"/></p>
<p>
<i>Cap C5 at the bottom center bypasses the R13 cathode resistor.</i></p>
<p>
Adding a bypass capacitor to a tube&#39;s cathode resistor is a common way to boost 
gain. Without a bypass capacitor electrons flow from ground through the R13 
cathode resistor to the tube&#39;s cathode (3), through the grid (2) and out the 
plate (1). As electrons are pulled through the cathode resistor a positive 
voltage is formed on the cathode which is used as the tube&#39;s bias voltage. In 
the circuit above (5E3 Deluxe second gain stage) about 1.7 volts DC will be 
found on the cathode.</p>
<p>
The larger the positive signal voltage is on the grid the larger the flow of 
electrons through the cathode resistor and therefore the larger the voltage on the 
cathode. These increases in cathode voltage and therefore bias voltage acts as a 
negative feedback mechanism because a higher bias voltage leads to a reduction 
in bias current. This bias voltage fluctuation helps keep the flow of electrons 
through the tube in check. This is why cathode biased tubes are called &#34;self 
biasing.&#34;</p>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Bypass_Cap2.jpg"/></p>
<p>
<i>5E3 Deluxe V1A bypass cap.</i></p>
<p>
Adding a bypass capacitor around the cathode resistor reduces this negative 
feedback because the <b>bypass capacitor acts as an electron reservoir</b>. When 
the tube&#39;s grid goes positive and flows more electrons through the tube it&#39;s 
much easier to pull electrons from the bypass cap reservoir than pull them 
through the cathode resistor. The freer flow leads to more electrons flowing 
through the tube so more gain is generated.</p>
<p>
When the grid goes negative and slows the flow of electrons through the tube the 
capacitor is recharged and is ready for the next positive grid electron demand.</p>

<h2>
How the Bassman&#39;s <a name="Long_Tail_Pair">Long Tail Pair</a> Phase Inverter Works</h2>
<p>
The Long Tail Pair (LTP) Phase Inverter (also called the cathode-coupled phase 
inverter) is the most popular phase inverter in 
guitar amplifiers due to its large output voltage swing and sweet overdrive tone. Unlike the non-amplifying cathodyne phase inverter in the 5E3
<i>Deluxe</i> the LTP phase inverter not only creates a dual mirror image signal 
stream but it also acts as a gain stage boosting the signal by about 1/4 of what 
two normal triode gain stages would. This added gain gives its output more 
voltage swing to drive big bottle power tubes to a fully distorted state. The 
LTP is a true differential amplifier that amplifies the difference between its 
two grids. It uses both halves of a dual triode tube (usually a 12AX7 or 
12AT7).</p>
<p>

<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Long_Tail_Pair_Layout.png"/></p>
<p>
<i>Signal flow shown with red arrows. Component numbers on the schematic and 
layout match. The signal enters the phase inverter at V3A&#39;s grid and flows out both its plate 
(inverted signal) and cathode (non-inverted signal). The cathode signal flows to 
V3B&#39;s cathode where it is amplified.</i></p>
<p>
For simplicity I will refer to the upper V3A triode as the &#34;upper triode&#34; and 
V3B as the &#34;lower.&#34;</p>
<p>
The upper triode in the schematic above has a dual function. It acts as a normal gain stage 
by outputting an inverted signal at its plate 
but also 
acts like a 
cathode follower by outputting a non-inverted signal at its cathode.</p>
<p>
In the schematic above the AC input signal flows through coupling capacitor C19. 
Cap C19 blocks the upper triode&#39;s 32.5v of DC grid voltage out of the tone stack. The signal 
then flows onto the upper grid while <b>the lower grid is held at a constant 
DC voltage</b> 
and all AC signal is sent to ground through shunt capacitor C20. C20 also passes 
the negative feedback signal to the lower triode grid. C20&#39;s third function is 
to act as a coupling cap to handle the DC voltage across the R36 tail resistor.</p>
<p>
The upper and lower cathodes are tied together. <b>All of the lower triode&#39;s input signal flows from 
the upper cathode</b>. With the lower grid held constant, signal voltage 
fluctuations on the lower cathode alter the electron flow from it to the plate 
which creates an amplified signal on the lower triode plate.</p>
<p>
R36 is the tail resistor that creates the relatively high voltage (34v DC in the 
<i>Bassman</i>) needed for the 
cathode follower function of the upper cathode. It also supplies a near constant current flow 
shared between the two cathodes--as current increases through the upper cathode the 
current decreases through the lower and vice versa.</p>
<p>
R34 is a standard bias resistor and creates a 1.5 volt difference between both tubes&#39; 
grid and cathode.</p>
<p>
R37 and R38 are simply grid leak resistors which leak off DC grid current to 
maintain a steady DC bias voltage between the grid and cathode.</p>
<p>
The plate load resistors R39 and R40 are different values to balance the 
difference in gain between the upper and lower triodes.</p>
<p>
The <b>negative feedback signal</b> from the output transformer&#39;s 2 ohm speaker tap is injected 
into the LTP phase inverter in two places: the lower grid through C20 and at the R36 tail resistor which leads to the cathode. The negative feedback signal on the 
lower grid is in phase with the primary signal on the upper grid and counteracts the signal 
resulting in negative feedback attenuation. Injecting the NFB signal at the tail 
resistor helps balance the feedback effect on the upper and lower plates. </p>
<p>
The <b>Presence control</b> (R35 and C21) removes a variable amount of high frequency 
from the negative feedback signal. Reducing negative feedback has the effect of boosting 
output so reducing the high frequencies in the negative feedback signal boosts high frequency output. C21 shunts high frequency 
AC NFB 
signal voltage to ground. Increasing C21&#39;s capacitance value will lower the 
cutoff frequency and bypass a larger range of frequencies to ground therefore 
boosting a larger frequency range at the speaker output.</p>
<p>
Capacitor C22 suppresses oscillations above audio frequencies between the two 
triodes&#39; plates to help stabilize the circuit.</p>
<p>
<b>LTP and cathodyne phase inverters present a very high impedance to upstream 
circuits because their grid leak resistors are &#34;bootstrapped&#34; to the phase 
inverter tail resistor</b>. The input signal on the grid is also present at the 
top of the tail resistor. This in-phase tail resistor signal reduces signal loss 
through the grid leak resistor which greatly reduces the load shown to the 
previous gain stage. Since impedance affects an audio filter&#39;s corner frequency 
we must use a much smaller coupling cap at the phase inverter grid to get the 
same low frequency roll off. This is why phase inverter input coupling caps are 
so small. AB763 blackface head cab amps use a 500pF coupling cap and the .022uF 
cap used by Marshall in their Plexi and JCM800 could easily be reduced to .002uF 
with no effect on tone but decrease the likelihood of blocking distortion.</p>
<p>
<b>Function Detail:</b> When a positive voltage signal arrives at the upper grid 
the reduction of blocking negative electrons on the grid allows electrons to 
flow from its cathode, through the grid, to its plate. The electrons flowing 
onto the plate <b>lowers the plate voltage</b>--this is the inverted and 
amplified output signal. As electrons leave the upper cathode a positive voltage is 
created on the cathode (scarcity of electrons = positive voltage) caused by the 
voltage drop across the cathode resistor R34. This positive 
signal voltage is also present in the lower cathode because the two cathodes are 
directly connected. Since the lower grid is held constant at 0 volts AC, any 
change in its cathode voltage will create a voltage difference between the grid 
and cathode. This voltage difference changes the flow of electrons from the 
cathode, through the grid to the plate. As the lower cathode goes positive (scarcity of 
electrons) fewer electrons will flow from it through the grid to the plate. The 
reduction of electrons flowing onto the plate<b> raises the plate voltage</b>--this is the non-inverted and 
amplified output signal.</p>

<p>
<i>Note the voltage difference between the tail resistor junction of 32.5v and 
the cathodes at 34v equaling a normal bias for a 12AX7 of 1.5v. The voltage 
difference between the grids (22 and 23v) and the resistor intersection (32.5v) 
is measurement error caused by voltage probe circuit loading. If the voltage 
difference were real the tube would be in cutoff.</i></p>
<hr/>

<p>If you power the power tube screen grids (g<sub><SPAN size="3">2</SPAN></sub>) 
from the output transformer center tap (B+) the tubes function as <b>normal 
pentodes</b> since the screen voltage will be fixed at or near B+. </p>
<p>But if you power the screens with the ends of the output transformer winding 
(same voltage as the power tube plates) the tube functions as a <b>triode</b> because the 
plates&#39; and screens&#39; voltage will fluctuate together. </p>
<p>An ultra-linear output transformer has two extra tap wires that power the 
power tube screen grids. The ultra-linear transformer taps are part way between the center tap 
and winding ends so the power tubes function as a <b>triode-pentode hybrid</b>. The 
screen voltage will fluctuate with the plates but with much less amplitude. <b>This results in more linear amplification (less clean 
signal distortion) and is used extensively in stereo audio tube amplifiers</b>.</p>
<p>Ultra-linear is such a fundamental change to how a power tube operates that 
it does affect both the amp&#39;s clean and overdrive tone. Some Fender silver face 
amps use ultra-linear and they tend to be loud, clean and excellent pedal 
platforms.</p>
<p>This diagram from Richard Kuehnel&#39;s <i>
<a href="http://www.ampbooks.com/mobile/books/power-amps/">Vacuum Tube Circuit 
Design: Guitar Amplifier Power Amps</a></i> shows the ultra-linear taps 
connected to the power tube screens:</p>

<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/ultralinear.gif" width="530" height="262"/></a></p>
<p><b>The problem is ultra-linear operation <i>reduces power tube distortion</i> 
which usually sounds better than preamp distortion</b>. This shifts the balance 
of preamp and poweramp distortion toward the preamp which is just not a good 
thing.</p>
<p>You can simply ignore the ultra-linear taps on an output transformer by 
disconnecting and insulating them and then powering the screen grids like normal 
guitar amps with an RC filter or choke between the center tap power node and 
screen grid node.</p>
<p>You can also put the screen grid connection on a switch and power them from 
either the ultra-linear taps or from their own power node. Use ultra-linear mode 
for clean headroom and to handle high output effects pedals and use the normal 
mode for sweet power tube distortion.</p>

<p>
Understanding impedance was one of the last things I figured out about guitar 
and amp electronics.</p>
<p>Impedance, whose symbol is Z, is only a factor in alternating current (AC) circuits 
so <b>in a guitar amplifier impedance applies to the guitar audio signal voltage 
and not so much to the DC power supply</b>.</p>
<p><b>Impedance is made up of three things that impede or restrict AC current flow: resistance, inductance and capacitance 
but its easier if you just <SPAN size="5">think of impedance as &#34;AC resistance.&#34;</SPAN></b> 
We&#39;ll leave inductance and capacitance to the end of this discussion to simplify 
things. The term &#34;impedance&#34; can apply to both signals and circuits.</p>
<p><SPAN size="5"><b><i>A</i></b></SPAN><b><i><SPAN size="5"> high

<p>I like to think of a low impedance signal as a slow moving, deep 
river and a high impedance signal as a shallow, fast moving stream. <b>I also 
visualize a high impedance signal as &#34;thin&#34; and a low impedance signal as being 
&#34;thick.&#34;</b></p>
<p>A thin signal is more likely to lose it&#39;s high end when it 
encounters resistors, capacitors and inductors.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take a 
look at a guitar circuit:</p>
<h2>
Simple Guitar Circuit</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Guitar_simple.jpg" width="400" height="229"/></p>
<p>
<i>The Pickup on the left generates the guitar signal. The 
Volume Pot bleeds guitar signal to ground to 
lower the guitar&#39;s output volume. A typical guitar has an impedance of 10k to 
20k ohms.</i></p>
<p>In the circuit below we short the guitar output jack and turn the volume pot all the 
way up so there&#39;s very little to restrict electron flow from one pickup coil wire, 
around the circuit and back to the pickup. This is a very low impedance circuit 
with lots of current flow and little restriction to generate electron pressure 
or voltage:</p>
<h2>Low Impedance Circuit</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Guitar_simple_max_vol.jpg" width="400" height="229"/></p>
<p><i>Electrons easily flow from the pickup coil, around the 
circuit, back to the pickup so we have high current and low voltage. The 
guitar&#39;s AC output audio signal will have very little voltage but lots of 
current will flow which makes this a low impedance circuit and a low impedance signal.</i></p>
<p>In the circuit below we turn the volume pot all the way down so the electron flow 
from the pickup has to flow through the volume pot&#39;s 500 kilohms of resistance. The 
circuit is now a high impedance circuit. A small amount of current flows because 
of the volume pot&#39;s restriction. This restriction causes the electrons to stack 
up at the pot which generates electron pressure or voltage across the pot:</p>
<h2>
High Impedance Circuit</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Guitar_simple_min_vol.jpg" width="400" height="229"/></p>
<p>
<i>Electrons stack up trying to flow through the volume pot&#39;s 500k of resistance 
which reduces current but increases the voltage across the volume pot. The 
guitar&#39;s AC audio signal at the pot&#39;s input will have high voltage but little 
current flow which makes it a high impedance circuit and high impedance signal.</i></p>
<p>
<b>You&#39;ve probably heard how a tone stack can &#34;load down&#34; an upstream preamp 
circuit</b>. The preamp tube&#39;s AC 
output audio signal is a high impedance signal with lots of voltage swing but 
very little current driving those voltage swings--I think of it as a &#34;thin&#34; 
signal. If the following circuit has a 
low impedance it will &#34;eat up&#34; or load down the audio signal&#39;s current. <b>The 
low impedance circuit allows too much current to sink to ground so the amplitude 
of the audio signal voltage swings are reduced and attenuated</b>. That&#39;s what 
happens in the tone stack when you turn the tone controls down. <b>The tone 
stack becomes a low impedance circuit and too much AC signal current can be bled 
to ground lowering the amp&#39;s output volume. Guitar players don&#39;t want their volume to 
change when they change a tone control setting.</b></p>

<p>
As I said in the beginning, impedance is made up of three things that impede or 
restrict AC current flow: resistance, inductance and capacitance.</p>
<p>
<b>Inductance</b> is generated by AC signals flowing through coils so guitar 
pickups add impedance to the guitar and amp input circuits.</p>
<p>
<b>Capacitance</b> in a circuit acts as a drag on AC signals because the signal 
looses energy moving electrons on and off the opposing capacitor 
&#34;plate.&#34; The &#34;plate&#34; can be the actual plate of a capacitor, the ground shield 
in a guitar cable or a nearby wire in an amp. There&#39;s even capacitance between 
the electrodes in a tube.</p>
<p>
<b>Tube amp gain stages typically put out high impedance signals (high voltage, 
low current, &#34;thin&#34;) but a cathode follower can put out much more 
current to create a low impedance signal</b>.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Input_and_Output_Impedance">Input and Output Impedance</a> Bridging</h2>
<p>It took me a long time to understand why input and 
output impedance matters in amplifier circuits. Here&#39;s my layman&#39;s explanation:</p>
<p><b>For simplicity sake you can think of impedance as AC 
resistance</b>. The <b>maximum power-transfer</b> theorem says to transfer the 
maximum amount of power from a source (guitar) to a load (amplifier), <b>the load impedance should 
match the source impedance </b>(a.k.a. Impedance Matching).</p>
<p>Impedance Matching is used for maximum power in the power amp circuit where the 
power tube output impedance is matched to the speaker impedance through the 
output transformer.Â But at the amp&#39;s guitar signal input we&#39;re not 
concerned with maximum <b>power</b> transfer, we want maximum <b>voltage</b> 
transfer because <b>a guitar amplifier amplifies a signal voltage</b>--the voltage changes 
are the audio signal. We really don&#39;t care about the current generated by a guitar&#39;s 
pickup coil, it&#39;s the 
pickup&#39;s voltage changes that will be amplified by the preamp tubes. <b>
<SPAN size="5">Since we favor voltage over current we can use an impedance 
mismatch to trade current for voltage. This intentional impedance mismatch reduces the 
<i>current</i> 
from the guitar but boosts the 
signal <i>voltage</i> the amplifier receives.</SPAN></b></p>
<h2>Guitar Output Impedance &amp; Amplifier Input Impedance</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Impedance.jpg"/></p>
<p><i>Guitar circuit on left, amplifier input on the right. The 
current generated by the guitar pickup coil must be allowed to loop back to the 
guitar pickup. Typical guitar impedance is around 10k to 20k ohms. The &#34;Amplifier Input Load Impedance&#34; is typically a 1 megaohm input 
resistor mounted on the amp&#39;s input jack.</i></p>
<p>In the diagram above the guitar&#39;s pickup coil generates a signal 
voltage. 
The guitar&#39;s output impedance is made up of the resistance of the pickup coil, volume and 
tone controls + the guitar circuit&#39;s capacitance and inductance. Since we can&#39;t control the output impedance of 
the guitar we can maximize the signal voltage by making the amplifier input  
impedance as large as possible, preferably 10 or more times greater than the 
guitar&#39;s output impedance (Rule of 10).</p>
<p><b>A high input impedance reduces the 
current flowing through the amplifier but increases the signal voltage level.</b> 
It also reduces distortion 
because the guitar&#39;s coil can output less current. This is called <b>high 
impedance bridging</b> and is used extensively in electronic audio circuits.
<b>The Input Resistor R1 on the 5F1 amplifier&#39;s guitar Jack 1 adds input impedance to boost the signal voltage from the guitar.</b></p>
<p>The same principal applies between amplifier stages. 
The output stage driver tube V1B sends the guitar signal 
voltage to the power tube V2. Low output impedance from the driver tube and high 
input impedance from the power tube boosts the signal voltage. This is what 
resistor R9 (power tube grid leak) does, it sets a high input impedance to the driver tube V2.Â 
<a href="#Signal_Input">Back to Signal Input</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><a name="Impedance_Mismatch_Between_Power_Tube_and_Speaker">Impedance Mismatch Between the Power Tube and Speaker</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier to get the most power out of the amplifier the power 
tube and speaker should match their impedance. But what happens when they don&#39;t 
match?</p>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Pentode_Power_vs_Distortion_graph.jpg" height="1733"/></p>
<p><i>Notice how when plate load resistance (bottom of graph) is 
increased beyond 4k ohms power output begins to drop off (left side of graph), 
total distortion increases, 2nd order harmonic distortion increases (2nd H) but 
nasty sounding 3rd order harmonic distortion (3rd H) increases much more. Also notice how when plate load is decreased 
power output again decreases, total distortion again increases but sweet sounding 2nd order 
harmonic distortion increases and and nasty sounding 3rd order decreases. This 
is why a low impedance mismatch can sound better than a perfect amp-to-speaker 
impedance match. Also note that when running a 6L6 amp with an 8 ohm output 
transformer hooked up to a 4 ohm speaker the load resistance is cut in half from 
4k to 2k and output power drops from 7.3 watts to 5.6 for a 23% power loss.</i></p>
<h2><b>High Mismatch</b></h2>
<p>If you connect a 16 ohm speaker to your 8 ohm output transformer (16 ohm load 
and 100% increase) the 
impedance as seen by the power tube plate increases and plate current 
decreases which can lengthen the lifespan of your power tubes, especially in 
Class A amps. This decrease in plate current will decrease demands on the power 
transformer and it will run cooler. Power filtering effectiveness is increased 
as current demand decreases so <b>hum and line noise should decrease</b>, especially 
in Class A amps. Decreased hum can help prevent <b>ghost notes</b> which are 
caused by hum interacting with musical notes to create false harmonic tones.</p>
<p>Since the power tube and transformer are not coupled at maximum efficiency 
some power is turned into transformer heat and <b>
the amp&#39;s power output is reduced</b>.</p>
<p>We get the opposite of the sonic improvements of a low impedance mismatch: <b>
Sweet sounding 2nd order harmonic distortion in the power tube and nasty 
sounding 3rd harmonic distortion <i>in</i>crease but the 3rd harmonic 
dominates</b>.</p>
<p><b>The main problems with a high impedance mismatch are increased screen 
current and flyback voltage</b> 
generated in the output transformer. A higher plate load impedance can
<a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Drawing_Tube_Load_Lines.htm#6V6GT">rotate the plate load line to below 
the knee</a> and cause excessive screen current which can melt the screens and 
kill the tubes. Flyback voltage can damage the power tubes and the output 
transformer itself. Flyback voltage spikes can cause the power tube to arc 
between pins or burn through the thin lacquer wire insulation used in the 
transformer windings. This is normally not a concern when going &#34;one step&#34; away 
from a match such as running a 4 ohm output transformer with an 8 ohm speaker 
unless the output transformer is cheaply made or really old. But running a 4 
ohm transformer with a 16 ohm speaker can generate very high flyback voltages 
when running the amp hard near max volume.</p>
<p><b>For you Hi-Fi guys</b>, increasing a speaker&#39;s impedance will change a 
passive crossover&#39;s crossover frequency. Changing out a two-way speaker&#39;s 4 ohm 
bass driver with an 8 ohm will shift the low pass filter&#39;s crossover point 
higher a full octave which will feed the bass driver more mid freqs and create 
an overlap where both the tweeter and bass driver are active. The bass driver 
impedance mismatch won&#39;t directly affect the tweeter crossover frequency.</p>
<h2><b>Low Mismatch</b></h2>
<p>If your output transformer is designed to match your power tubes to an 8 ohm 
speaker and you connect a 4 ohm speaker then the impedance as seen 
by the power tube plate decreases by 50% too. <b>Less impedance will cause plate current 
to increase</b>. The power tubes are stressed by this increased plate current so the <b>power tube 
lifespan can be shortened</b>. This is especially true of Class A amps because 
they idle near max current flow. Since the plate current idles near maximum, the 
entire power supply also runs at maximum output so the <b>rectifier tube and 
power transformer will run hotter</b>. Power filtering effectiveness is reduced 
as current demand increases so <b>hum and noise may increase</b>, especially in 
Class A amps. Increased hum can cause <b>ghost notes</b>.</p>
<p>The increase in primary current will cause the <b>output transformer to run 
hotter</b>. This generation of excess heat reduces power output at the speaker.</p>
<p>Many vintage Fender tube combo amps have an <b>aux speaker jack</b> that&#39;s 
wired in parallel with the built-in speaker. Plugging in a speaker rated at the 
same ohms as the built-inÂ speaker will cut the speaker load in half for a &#34;one step&#34; low 
mismatch. Fender designed their output transformers to handle this and is 
considered safe.</p>
<p><b>But there are two possible sonic improvements with a power tube and speaker 
low mismatch. Sweet sounding 2nd order harmonic distortion in the power tube 
increases and nasty sounding 3rd harmonic distortion decreases dramatically</b>. 
This is why it&#39;s worth experimenting with different speaker loads, you may like 
the tone you get. This is also why I prefer a 6.6k:8 ohm output transformer for 
6V6 power tubes like the <i>Deluxe Reverb</i> uses instead of the typical 6V6 
8k:8 ohm transformer.</p>
<p>If your power and/or output transformers run hot with a matched speaker load then mismatching them is more of a risk.<b> The 
bottom line is the greater the low impedance mismatch, the harder your amp works, 
and the greater the high impedance mismatch, the more likely you are to burn out 
your output transformer and/or power tubes. For tube amps a low mismatch is safer 
than a high mismatch, that&#39;s why most speaker jacks have a shorting switch--a 
short is better than an open circuit. The opposite is generally true for solid state amps--a 
short will burn out their output transistors.</b> An output transformer open 
circuit must be avoided, that&#39;s why I recommend soldering speaker wire to the 
speaker and why I recommend you shut down your amp before changing the speaker 
impedance switch (and avoid cheap impedance switches in your builds).</p>
<p><b>For two-way Hi-Fi speakers</b>, decreasing a speaker&#39;s impedance will 
change a passive crossover&#39;s crossover frequency. Changing out a two-way 
speaker&#39;s 8 ohm bass driver with a 4 ohm will shift the low pass filter&#39;s 
crossover point lower a full octave which will feed the bass driver less mid 
freqs and create a &#34;hole&#34; in the speaker system&#39;s frequency response. The bass 
driver impedance mismatch won&#39;t directly affect the tweeter crossover frequency.</p>
<h2><b>Running 2 Power Tubes in a 4 Power Tube Amp</b></h2>
<p>Many push-pull amps designed to run 4 power tubes can be run with 2 power 
tubes to cut the output power in half. But since the output transformer was 
designed to load the current put out by 4 power tubes we need to make an 
adjustment on the speaker end to load 2 tubes properly. <b>Since 2 power tubes 
put out <i>half the current</i> of 4 tubes we need to double the speaker 
impedance so 2 tubes feel the same load as when 4 tubes are used</b>. If your 
amp is designed to run an 8 ohm speaker with 4 tubes like the AB763 Blackface<i> 
Single Showman</i>, it will need a 16 ohm speaker when run with 2 power tubes.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><a name="Speaker_Phase">Amp and Speaker Phase</a></h2>
<p>Amplifier and speaker phase has to do with which way a speaker moves, in or 
out, with a positive voltage at the amp input (such as a 1.5v battery + terminal 
to input jack tip). <b>For multiple speakers playing the same source material 
such as a stereo audio amp or a multi speaker guitar cab, phase does matter</b>. 
You want all the speakers moving in concert--all of them moving out together, 
then in together. If not there will be interactions between the speakers that 
change the apparent volume of certain frequencies. A loss of low end is usually 
what is noticed but the volume loss and frequencies depend upon the position of 
the listener. </p>
<p><b>For single speaker amps however, phase does not matter</b>. I have had 
guitar players argue with me that it does matter, especially when they are 
working with guitar/amp feedback. Why would it matter if the speaker moves 
outward when the guitar string moves upward versus downward? If the listener (or 
guitar player if he is working with amp feedback) moves a foot or two toward or 
away from the amp speaker the phase flips at his location so phase does not 
matter.</p>
<p><b>Many multi-channel guitar amplifiers have different phase for different 
channels</b>. If a channel has 1 or 3 extra gain stages compared to another 
channel then the amp/speaker phase will be 100% different between those two 
channels at the speakers. Again, this does not matter due to the material in the 
previous paragraph. But, if you jumper two out of phase channels they will sound 
weak and funky due to the phase cancellation when the two channels meet inside 
the amp.</p>
<p><b>What about two guitar players playing the exact same song? Does it matter 
if their two amps and speakers are in phase?</b> No, because their picking would 
have to be incredibly synchronized to make a difference. At 1000Hz there is 
three hundredths of a second difference between the signal and 100% out of 
phase. The placement of the players&#39; amp speakers is also important. A 1000Hz 
signal has a wavelength of 13.5 inches so if one of the speakers is 6.75 inches 
closer to the listener the phase will change by 100%. <b>Don&#39;t worry about your 
band mates being out of phase with you or your amp</b>.</p>
		<p><b>Changing an amp&#39;s phase can help when recording live performances</b>. 
		Standing acoustic waves can cause tonal anomalies that can sometimes be 
		improved by changing the phase of the guitar or bass amp. The bass amp 
		open E is 41Hz which has a wavelength of 25 feet so flipping the 
		polarity of a bass amp can change a standing pressure wave at the 
		microphone to a standing wave trough which may solve the guitar and bass 
		interaction at the microphone. Live concert sound board operators 
		sometimes run into the same situation. At their location there is a 
		funky interaction and by flipping the phase of the guitar or bass signal 
		using the sound board can improve the tone at his location. The problem 
		is if he moved to a new location he could find another spot with similar 
		funky interaction.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say we take a new 325-0-325v rated power transformer out 
of the box and connect the primary to 125 volts AC from the wall. The power 
transformer center tap and high voltage secondary wires aren&#39;t connected to 
anything (they&#39;re floating) and we measure 650 volts AC from one high voltage 
secondary wire to the other. We would also measure around 325 volts AC from 
either hot wire to the center tap.</p>
<p><b>We can touch either hot wire or center tap and not get 
shocked because the voltage isn&#39;t referenced to ground--the voltage is only 
between the three secondary wires. If we measure the voltage between a metal 
ground rod sunk into the earth and any secondary wire we&#39;ll see only random low 
voltage caused by transformer leakage.</b></p>
<p>But if we touch any two secondary wires we will get shocked.</p>
<p>If we connect the power transformer center tap to an un-grounded 
metal chassis we would measure around 325 VAC between either high voltage wire 
and the chassis but we can still touch a single hot wire or the chassis (not 
both) and we won&#39;t get shocked.</p>
<p>If we ground the chassisÂ  we now have a modern, standard, 
powered amplifier. We and the grounded chassis have a common path literally 
through the ground. If we touch an amp hot wire electrons can flow between the 
ground and the hot wire through our body and shock us.</p>
<p>If we rest one hand on the chassis and touch a hot wire with the 
other then 325 volts AC will push current from one hand to the other across our 
chest--that&#39;s why we have the <i>one-hand rule</i> for working on hot 
amplifiers.</p>
<p>If we stand on an insulated plastic box so our body has no path 
to earth we can touch either hot wire and not get shocked.</p>
<p>We can hold the grounded chassis in our hands and connect a hot 
wire (or failed short capacitor) to the chassis and not get shocked because the 
lowest impedance path to earth is through the chassis ground wire. Now if we 
were standing in a pool of water in our basement and did that we would probably 
feel a tingle. </p>

<p><i>The early Gibsonette (mid-late 1940&#39;s) has an unusual design. It uses a 
single pentode (6SJ7 tube) stage for the preamp, a self-split push-pull power amp 
(2x6V6) which requires no phase inverter. The self-split power amp works like this: The guitar signal 
on the upper power tube grid changes the current flowing through the tube which 
causes a voltage drop across the cathode resistor. This voltage drop is also 
present on the lower power tube cathode and since the lower grid is grounded 
(common grid) the voltage changes on the cathode affect the current flowing 
through the lower power tube. The speaker field coil is an electromagnet that 
takes the place of the speaker permanent magnet. The field coil also acts as the 
choke.</i></p><hr/>

<p><i>The GA-40 V3 uses one 5879 pentode per channel as a single 
preamp stage. The paraphase phase inverter lower triode gets its signal to its 
grid through the upper 470k grid leak resistor. The tremolo oscillation is fed 
to the channel 2 preamp plate. The &#34;Tremolo High Pass Filter&#34; is a fifth order 
high pass filter which removes tremolo thumping that can be created in the 
tremolo oscillation. Each RC network stage rolls off at a slope of 6dB per 
octave at 32Hz. Five successive filters create a very steep filter cut which allows the 
corner frequency to be set low enough to allow normal bass response in the 
tremolo channel (Channel 2) while still killing tremolo thump.</i></p><hr/>

<p><i>Magnatone used an unusual first stage bias circuit in some 
of their amps including the 280. Using the upper 1A &#34;High&#34; input jack bias voltage is generated 
by the 
4.7M Grid Leak/ Grid Bias resistor because it creates a voltage drop as grid current flows 
through it. The 470 ohm Cathode resistor generates a voltage drop when 
electrons flow from the cathode to plate. Since this circuit has no blocking 
capacitor the grid bias voltage will be passed to the guitar. When the lower 1B 
&#34;Low&#34; input jack is used the 4.7M grid leak resistor is bypassed so no grid leak 
bias is generated.</i></p>

<p>Humbucking pickups are really two single coil pickups connected together in a 
way that cancels noise and doubles the pickup output voltage. Humbuckers use common mode noise rejection to reduce hum 
and other electromagnetic noise picked up from surrounding sources like fluorescent lights. Any noise that gets 
into both pickup coils is nullified when the two signals from the two coils are 
combined because the noise signals from the two coils are of opposite phase.</p>
<p>In 
other words the positive noise signal is added to the negative noise signal and 
they wipe each other out. We get a &#34;positive&#34; coil and &#34;negative&#34; coil by simply 
winding the wire in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Why doesn&#39;t the guitar string signal get nullified like the noise? Because of the opposite magnetic polarity of the 
pickups&#39; pole pieces. One pickup has North up magnets and the other has South 
up magnets. This flips the 
signal polarity of one coil so the string signals are in phase, not out of phase 
like the noise. The string signals from the two coils are added together 
instead of being subtracted and nullified.</p>
<p>Just like two humbucker pickup coils, two separate pickups can be paired 
together to work as humbuckers and reduce noise if the two pickup coils are 
connected the right way.</p>
<p><b>You need two things to get hum cancelation in a humbucker pickup or between two 
single coil pickups: Opposite electrical current flow in the two coils--one coil&#39;s 
string generated current flows clockwise, the other coil flows 
counter-clockwise. The two pickups must also have opposite magnetic 
polarity (North+South).</b></p>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Guitar_Pickup_Polarity.jpg" width="1200" height="846"/></p>
<p><i>The two coils of the bridge humbucker circulate electric 
current generated by the strings in opposite directions. The black arrows show 
the direction of current flow around the pickup coils. The same is true when you select switch position 
2 which pairs the right bridge humbucker coil with the mid pickup and switch position 4 
which pairs the mid and neck pickups. The magnetic poles of the left humbucker 
coil are South up and the right coil is North up. In switch position 2 the North 
bridge coil is paired with the South mid pickup. In switch position 4 the 
South mid pickup is paired with the North neck pickup. 5-Way switch positions 
are: 1 Bridge Humbucker, 2 North Humbucker coil + South Mid Pickup, 3 Mid 
Pickup, 4 South Mid Pickup + North Neck Pickup, 5 Neck Pickup.</i></p>
<p><b>It is pretty obvious when you pair two coils out of electrical phase</b> 
(both coils&#39; electrical flow running in the same direction)--the guitar tone is weak 
and tinny because the two string signals are subtracting and nullifying each 
other. The solution is easy, just swap one of the coil&#39;s two hookup wires to 
reverse its electrical flow.</p>
<p><b>It&#39;s much harder to detect by ear when a pair of coils are in phase 
electrically but out of phase magnetically</b>--they will sound normal when paired but there will be no hum cancelation 
so you <i>may</i> notice some 60Hz electrical hum. The easiest way to check the 
magnetic polarity of two pickups is to carefully move the two pickups close 
together--top pole to top pole. If they magnetically repel each other they are 
the same polarity and will not hum cancel. <b>If they attract each other they are 
opposite polarity and will hum cancel when paired</b>. You can also purchase a $9 
<a href="http://www.stewmac.com/Luthier_Tools/Tools_by_Job/Electronics_and_Pickups/Pickup_building/Magnet_Polarity_Tester.html">Schatten Design Magnetic Polarity Tester</a> from Stewmac which makes checking installed pickups a breeze.</p>
<p>Many pickup manufacturers will change the magnetic polarity of their pickups 
for no charge. I had to do this on
<a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/TelecasterMod.htm#Magnetic_Polarity_Problems">my Telecaster</a> to get 
the mid and neck pickups to hum cancel. Note that if you change the magnetic polarity of a pickup the current flow direction 
will also reverse so you will have to swap its hookup wires to keep the same 
electrical polarity. <b>Be aware that some aftermarket pickups have the opposite 
magnetic polarity as modern Fender pickups so when purchasing pickups that will 
be paired for humbucking make sure you know what magnetic polarity you&#39;re 
ordering.</b></p>

<p>Here&#39;s two transistor circuits that look and function very much 
like tube amp circuits. The first is the <i><b>transistor common emitter 
amplifier</b></i>:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Triode_Tube.png" width="523" height="317"/><img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/TransistorCommonEmitterAmp.png" width="416" height="274"/></p>
<p><i>Tube triode amp circuit on the left, transistor common 
emitter amp on the right. Remove transistor resistor R2 and this circuit looks 
just like a tube amplifier stage. <b>The two circuits serve the exact same purpose</b>.</i></p>
<p>The big difference between the tube and transistor amp circuit 
is the addition of resistor R<sub>2</sub>.Â  Resistors R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> 
form a voltage divider which sets the bias voltage on the transistor&#39;s base 
(similar to a tube&#39;s control grid). Resistors R<sub>C</sub> and 
R<sub>E</sub> determine the amplifier gain and set the max current. Capacitor C<sub>E</sub> 
is a standard bypass cap to boost gain. Capacitors C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> are 
standard coupling caps.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the <i><b>transistor emitter follower</b></i>. It bears 
an uncanny resemblance to a tube cathode follower:</p>
<p>

emitter follower on the right. Remove transistor resistor R<sub>1</sub> and this 
circuit looks just like a tube cathode follower. <b>The two circuits serve the

<p>Again, the big difference between the tube and transistor amp 
circuit is the addition of resistor R<sub>1</sub>.Â  Resistors R<sub>1</sub> 
and R<sub>2</sub> form a voltage divider which sets the transistor&#39;s bias 
voltage on the base (input). A 
transistor emitter follower can be used as an easy to implement tone stack 
buffer or effects loop buffer because they do not need a cathode heater.</p><hr/>
<h2>
How <a name="Voltage_Dividers">Voltage Dividers</a> and Pots (potentiometers) Work</h2>
<p>
When I first got into electronics I had a hard time understanding voltage 
dividers but they are really pretty simple. Understanding them is important 
because a tube amp is full of them. Even tone controls and tone stacks can be 
thought of as voltage dividers. The Soldano SLO-100 high gain amp uses five 
voltage dividers to bleed off excess guitar signal to prevent harsh <i>over</i>-overdrive.</p>
<h2>
Classic Voltage Divider</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Voltage_Divider.png"/></p>
<p>
<i>Note how there is 100 volts at the top of the resistors and <b>0 volts at the 
bottom (ground)</b>. The resistance above the output is R1 and the lower is R2.</i></p>
<p>
A voltage divider literally divides voltage. Take a look at the diagram above.
<b>We have two 500k resistors with 100 volts at the top andÂ  0 volts 
(ground) at the bottom</b>.<b> If we tap the resistors at the top we get 100 
volts, tap the resistors at the bottom and we get 0 volts. <i>Now if we tap the resistors 
at the middle, half way down at 500k, we will get half the voltage, 50 volts</i></b>. Tap 
higher and the voltage moves toward 100v, tap lower and the voltage goes down 
toward 0 volts.</p>
<p>
Note the equation at the bottom of the diagram above:Â  The formula to 
calculate the voltage out of a voltage divider is:</p>
<p>
<b><SPAN size="5">Voltage Out = Voltage In * resistance below the output / total resistance</SPAN></b></p>
<p>
We can calculate the 
voltage out of the voltage divider by multiplying the Voltage in * R2 / (R1 + 
R2).</p>
<p>
For our voltage above we get: 100v * 500,000 / (500,000 + 500,000) = 100v * 
.5 = 50 volts out.</p>
<p>
The R2 / (R1 + R2) determines the ratio of the upper to lower 
resistance. If you make the lower resistor smaller, more voltage will be bled to 
ground so you will have less voltage out.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Voltage_Divider_Theory.png" height="749"/></p>
<p>
<i>We have 100 volts at the top of this multi-resistor divider and 0 volts (ground) at 
the bottom. We get lower voltages as we move down the 
resistance.</i></p>
<p>
If we make the top resistor in a two resistor divider 250k and the lower 
resistor 750k we know less 
voltage would be bled to ground so the output voltage would be higher: 100v * 
750,000 / (250,000 + 750,000) = 100v * .75 = 75 volts out.</p>
<p>

<i>Note how the placement of the upper resistor is important. The circuit on the 
right is <b>not</b> a voltage divider.</i></p>

<h2>
<a name="Treble_Peaker">Treble Peaker</a>s</h2>
<p>
Treble Peakers are a special type of bright cap that bypass the upper 
(attenuating) resistor in a voltage divider. By bypassing the upper resistor 
high frequencies bypass the voltage divider and are not cut. A Treble Peaker cap acts 
as a semi-active high frequency boost. In the voltage divider below the guitar 
signal is cut in half except for high frequencies--they go around the divider 
and are not cut so in effect high frequencies above the bright cap corner 
frequency are doubled in volume compared to the rest of the guitar signal. 
Treble Peakers are used in all high gain tube guitar amplifiers to give the amp 
high gain sizzle. The Marshall JCM800 uses two 470pF Treble Peakers and the 
Soldano SLO-100 uses a single .002uF Treble Peaker in the Overdrive Channel and 
a tiny 120pF in the Clean Channel. A common mod in these amps is to remove a 
Treble Peaker to cut ice pick highs.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Treble_Peaker.png" height="749"/></p>
<p>
<i>The Treble Peaker cap allows high frequencies to go around the upper resistor 
so they are not cut by the voltage divider.</i></p>

<h2>
Potentiometers (pots)</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Potentiometer.png" height="585"/></p>
<p>
<i>A potentiometer (pot) is simply a variable voltage divider. Schematic symbol 
on the left, layout symbol on the right. Pot terminal numbers &#34;1, 2, 3&#34; are 
shown on both symbols. The potentiometer got it&#39;s name from voltage <b>potential</b>. &#34;Shaft Down&#34; means the pot&#39;s knob shaft is pointing away 
from you.</i></p>
<p>
Now take a look at the pot diagram above. Look familiar? <b>A pot is simply a
</b> <i><b>
variable voltage divider</b></i>. If we turn the voltage tap, or wiper, to the 
top of the pot we get 100 volts, turn the wiper to the bottom and we get 0 
volts (because it&#39;s directly connected to ground). In the diagram the wiper is at 50% so there&#39;s 500k above the wiper and 
500k below the wiper so the input voltage is cut in half. <i><b>Now we can tap 
the voltage by placing the wiper anywhere between the 100 volts at the input, to 
the 0 volts at the ground connection</b>.</i></p>
<p>
<b>The formula to calculate the voltage out is the same as a voltage divider: 
resistance below the wiper / total resistance</b>. &#34;R1&#34; is the pot resistance 
above the wiper 
and &#34;R2&#34; is the resistance below the wiper on the ground side. For 
example we turn the 1M linear pot 1/4 turn up from &#34;off&#34; we know that 1/4 of 1M 
= 250k. That 250k is movement up from off or 0 volts so R2 = 250k and R1 would 
be the rest of 1M or 750k. Voltage 
out = 100v * 250,000 / (250,000 + 750,000) = 100v * .25 = 25 volts out.</p>
<h2>
Pot With Arrow</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Pot_with_Arrow.jpg" height="209"/></p>
<p>
<i>The downward arrow pointing to &#34;CW&#34; means the direction the wiper moves when 
you turn the pot knob clockwise or &#34;up.&#34; If &#34;CW&#34; is not shown then assume the arrow 
points in the clockwise direction. If there is no arrow you can assume that the 
wiper moves upward when you turn the pot clockwise.</i></p>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Attenuator_Plus_Potentiometer.png" height="764"/></p>
<p>
<i>Attenuator resistor (R1a 500k) added to a volume pot to reduce max volume. The 
R1a resistance is added to the pot&#39;s &#34;above the wiper&#34; resistance so it adds 
attenuation (cuts the max guitar signal out). With 
the pot set to the mid point with 500k + 500k above the wiper and 500k below the wiper 
gives us a 66% cut in the guitar signal compared to a 
50% cut without the attenuation resistor. <b>With the pot set to max the attenuator 
resistor will still cause a 33% cut in guitar signal</b>. This simple circuit 
can be used in high gain preamp circuits to control excess gain. If needed, a bright cap 
can be placed in parallel with the attenuator resistor to allow high frequencies 
to go around the resistor and keep the attenuator resistor from 
darkening the amp&#39;s tone. <b>The formula to calculate the voltage out is the 
same as a voltage divider: resistance below the wiper / total resistance</b>.</i></p>
<h2>
Capacitive Voltage Dividers</h2>
<p>
Resistance based voltage dividers work the same with AC or DC voltage but we can put two capacitors in the same configuration as the R1 and R2 resistors 
above and form a capacitive voltage divider that divides AC voltage. The 
capacitors block DC voltage and current so only AC voltage is divided.</p>

<a name="Calculating_Parallel_Resistance">Calculating Parallel Resistance<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Equation_Parallel_Resistors.jpg"/></a></h2>
<p>
<b>The first time I saw the equation for calculating the resistance of resistors 
in parallel I had a mental meltdown</b>. It actually stopped me in my tracks as 
I attempted to self-learn electronics back in high school. Then I discovered the 
calculator&#39;s <span>1/</span><i><span>x</span></i> 
or <b>inverse key</b> that made this equation super simple.</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s say you have three resistors in parallel: R1 is 100 ohms, R2 is 200 ohms 
and R3 is 300 ohms.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Parallel_Resistors_Schematic.png"/></p>
<p>
<i>Circuit total resistance = 54.5 ohms. Using Ohm&#39;s Law current = .22 amps, 
power = 2.6 watts.</i></p>
<p>
<b>This would be the key sequence on the calculator</b></p>
<p>
100 <span>1/</span><i><span>x</span></i> 
+ 200 <span>1/</span><i><span>x</span></i> 
+ 300 <span>1/</span><i><span>x</span></i> 
= <span>1/</span><i><span>x</span></i></p>
<p>
Don&#39;t forget that last <span>1/</span><i><span>x</span></i> 
key, it&#39;s for the 1/ on top of the equation. 54.5 ohms should be showing on 
the calculator screen when you hit that last
<span>1/</span><i><span>x</span></i> 
key. Give it a try right now, open your computer&#39;s on screen calculator and 
follow the key sequence.</p>
<p>
The Windows built-in 
calculator has a <span>1/</span><i><span>x</span></i> 
key. If the <span>1/</span><i><span>x</span></i> 
key is not showing when you open the Windows calculator select &#34;Scientific&#34; then click on the

<a name="Measuring_Resistance_In_Circuit">Measuring Resistance In Circuit</a></h2>
<p>
I have seen many amps &#34;repaired&#34; with new resistors because the owner/builder 
measured resistors&#39; resistance and replaced them due to what they thought was 
component value drift.</p>
<p>
Your multi-meter applies a very low level DC voltage and 
current to a resistor in order to measure its resistance. The problem is when 
you try to measure resistance with the resistor in an amp or &#34;in circuit&#34; there 
is often a &#34;back door&#34; path for your meter&#39;s current flow that will cause an 
inaccurate resistance measurement.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/images/Guitar/HowAmpsWork/Measuring_In_Circuit_Resistance.png" height="600"/></p>
<p>
<i>The first two circuits have two paths for the meter&#39;s test current so 
measured resistance is much less than expected. In the third circuit a cap 
blocks current flow so an accurate reading is taken. &#34;Lifting a leg&#34; in the last circuit 
also 
ensures an accurate measurement.</i></p>
<p>
<b>The key to knowing when an in circuit measurement will be true is being able 
to read the schematic so you can follow the &#34;back door&#34; path(s) to see if it 
will cause inaccuracy</b>. An unpowered tube grid, plate and cathode are &#34;dead 
ends&#34; that will not pass current. Capacitors are also dead ends that will not 
allow DC current to flow. Typical transformer windings have from 0.5 to 300 ohms 
of resistance so they do provide a back door. To be sure you can always unsolder 
one end of a resistor to get an accurate measurement.</p><hr/>

The &#34;Engineering Mode&#34; available in Excel spreadsheets, scientific calculators (including 
the Windows built-in scientific calculator) and mathematic

<p>Notice how all the exponents are multiples of 3? The exponent 
tells you how many places to shift the decimal point. A negative exponent means 
we shift the decimal point to to the left to make the number smaller. A positive 
exponent means we shift to the right for a larger number. With 47E-6 we would shift 
the decimal point 6 places left to give you .000047</p>
<p>250pF would be shown in the calculator as &#34;250E-12&#34; 
(see chart, read E-12 as pico)</p>
<p>32 milliamps 
would be shown as &#34;32E-3&#34;</p>
<p>56K would be &#34;56E3&#34; and 1M would be &#34;1E6&#34;</p>
