          <div><div><p><span lang="EN-GB">Step into a damp autumn woodland after rain and the ground comes alive. Shaggy parasols push through leaf litter, bracket fungi climb tree trunks like shelves, and tiny bird’s nest fungi hold their spore “eggs” in miniature cups. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">One of the joys of studying fungi, known as mycology, is the challenge of identifying all the fascinating shapes and fungi forms. The Victorian author Beatrix Potter was a pioneering mycologist, studying fungi under the microscope and producing exquisite illustrations to record their features.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">With thousands of species in the UK, even experienced mycologists are still learning. This creates a wonderfully supportive environment, where mistakes are expected and everyone can grow in their knowledge. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">From the glowing green of the biofluorescent shaggy scalycap to puffballs releasing billions of spores in a smoky cloud, fungi are among the most extraordinary lifeforms on Earth and they’re all around us, once you learn where to look. </span><span> </span></p>
</div></div>
      </div><div>
          <div><div><h2><span lang="EN-GB">What are fungi?</span><span> </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Fungi aren’t plants, they belong to their own kingdom and are actually more closely related to animals. In the UK, scientists have identified over 15,000 species, of which less than a third produce visible fruiting bodies such as mushrooms, puffballs, and bracket fungi. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">A single giant puffball (</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Calvatia gigantea</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) can release an astonishing seven trillion spores into the air. Yet the visible fruiting body is only the tip of the fungi. The real bulk of the fungus is hidden underground or in its food source: a network of fine threads called mycelium, which can grow through soil, wood, flour or even jet fuel. (The so-called kerosene fungus thrives in aircraft fuel tanks, so antifungal agents are added to stop it clogging engines!)</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Some fungi are adaptable generalists, while others are picky specialists. The splitgill fungus (</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Schizophyllum commune</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">), for example, is a generalist as it grows on a huge variety of dead wood from broadleaf trees all over the world and is most widespread fungi on Earth. It also has over 28,000 different sexes, a reminder that fungi relationships are every bit as complicated as human ones.</span><span> </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">You can find fungi at any time of year, but the best seasons are spring and autumn, when warmth and dampness bring fruit bodies to life. Knowing where to look is half the fun. In the UK, the two main habitats are grassland and woodland. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Identifying what a fungus is growing on can help narrow down possibilities. Though sometimes it’s hard to tell whether the mycelium is feeding on moss, a buried twig, or the surrounding soil. But with practice you’ll discover bird’s nest fungi (Nidulariaceae) often appear on woodchip, while wood ear fungi (</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Auricularia auricula-judae</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) grow mainly on elder trees.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Sadly, fungi are disappearing from both urban areas and intensively managed farmland, where soils are often hostile to fungal life. However, fungi also appear in the most unexpected places. Desert truffles (</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Terfezia</span></em><span lang="EN-GB"> species) grow in sand, several fungi species have been found living on the outside of space stations, and a radiation-loving yeast (</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Cryptococcus neoformans</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) has been discovered thriving at Chernobyl.</span><span> </span></p>

          <div><div><h2><span lang="EN-GB">Shapes, smells, and textures</span><span> </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">When it comes to identification, colour is rarely reliable, except perhaps when spotting the most well-known of toadstools the fly agaric (</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Amanita muscaria</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) or lesser known shaggy scalycap (</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Pholiota squarrosa</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">), which glows bright green under ultraviolet light. For most fungi, shape is a better clue: from classic cap-and-stem mushrooms to stinkhorns, trumpets, cups, clubs, puffballs, and brackets.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Texture and smell are also helpful. Is it slimy, waxy, scaly, or woody? Does it smell of radish, potato, bleach or perhaps coconut, honey, or ink? Some fungi are unmistakable once you catch their scent.</span><span> </span></p>

<h2><span>Learn more about fungi</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Fungi are remarkable recyclers of the natural world, yet they’re also inspiring human innovation. The oyster mushroom (</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Pleurotus ostreatus</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) is now being used to grow sustainable packaging and insulation, while other fungi are showing promise in breaking down plastics.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The best way to start your own fungi journey is out in nature. Join a Wildlife Trust fungus foray, walk or workshop and discover these hidden treasures for yourself. Visit </span><a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/events"><span lang="EN-GB">our events page</span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> and search for fungi.</span><span> </span></p>
