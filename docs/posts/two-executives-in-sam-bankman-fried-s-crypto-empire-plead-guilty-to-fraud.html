They were key lieutenants in Mr. Bankman-Fried’s vast business empire, which rested primarily on FTX and Alameda, companies that he founded and ran.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission also filed civil fraud charges against Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang on Wednesday. The S.E.C. said that Ms. Ellison, 28, had misused FTX customer deposits to fund Alameda’s trading activity and that Mr. Wang, 29, had created software that allowed that diversion of funds to take place. The S.E.C. case builds on civil charges filed against Mr. Bankman-Fried, 30, this month.</p><p>The guilty pleas and cooperation agreements are a major advance in the criminal fraud case against Mr. Bankman-Fried, who is in U.S. custody after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/technology/sbf-ftx-extradition.html" title="">agreeing to be extradited </a>from the Bahamas earlier on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The combination of criminal and civil charges against the former top executives puts Mr. Bankman-Fried in an even more perilous legal position, with the federal government having said he oversaw a sweeping, yearslong fraud that transformed him from one of the most powerful people in the crypto industry into a criminal defendant potentially facing decades in prison.</p><p>Federal prosecutors and regulators in the United States have said Mr. Bankman-Fried <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/business/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-fraud-charges.html?name=styln-ftx&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;block=storyline_menu_recirc&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=LegacyCollection&amp;variant=show&amp;is_new=false" title="">carried out a fraud</a> that diverted billions in customer money for other uses, including buying real estate in the Bahamas, trading crypto at Alameda, making campaign donations and investing in other crypto companies. Prosecutors contend he defrauded customers, investors and lenders to his crypto trading firm before it collapsed in bankruptcy last month.</p><p>The charges have also come as a major blow to the crypto industry, which has been reeling for the past year as prices of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have plunged and firms have filed for bankruptcy. The collapse of FTX and the fraud charges have unsettled customers of other trading platforms, which had been assured their money was safe and protected.</p><div><section role="complementary" aria-label="What to Know About the Collapse of FTX"><p><h2>What to Know About the Collapse of FTX</h2></p><div id="storyline-context-container" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><p><span>Card 1 of 5</span></p><div data-scrolled-index="0"><div><div aria-hidden="false"><div><p><strong>What is FTX?<!-- --> </strong><span>FTX is a now bankrupt company that was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/technology/ftx-binance-crypto-explained.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-ftx&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc">one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges</a>.

In November, Mr. Zhao said he would sell the tokens and expressed concerns about FTX’s financial stability.

Traders rushed to withdraw from FTX, causing the company to have a $8 billion shortfall.

On Dec. 12, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/business/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-bahamas.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-ftx&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc">Mr. Bankman-Fried was arrested</a> in the Bahamas for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/business/prosecutors-charge-that-ftx-was-engaged-in-fraud-from-the-beginning.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-ftx&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc">lying to investors and committing fraud</a>.

He also claimed he wasn’t fully aware of what was happening at Alameda.</p><p>Mr. Williams, in his statement, also said Mr. Bankman-Fried was in F.B.I. custody and being flown back to the United States, and would be presented before a judge as soon as possible. He is expected to be taken into Federal District Court in Manhattan as early as Thursday.</p><p>Lawyers for Ms. Ellison declined to comment. Ilan Graff, a lawyer for Mr. Wang, said, “Gary has accepted responsibility for his actions and takes seriously his obligations as a cooperating witness.”</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Bankman-Fried declined to comment.</p><p>In its complaint, the S.E.C. said Ms. Ellison, under direction from Mr. Bankman-Fried, had manipulated the price of a digital currency that FTX created, called FTT, by buying large quantities of the crypto token to prop up its price.</p><p>Alameda was one of the major firms that was trading FTT and had used the crypto token as collateral for loans it got from other big crypto firms to fund its trading.</p><p>Sanjay Wadhwa, deputy director of the S.E.C.’s Division of Enforcement, said Mr. Bankman-Fried, Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang “were active participants in a scheme to conceal material information from FTX investors, including through the efforts of Mr. Bankman-Fried and Ms. Ellison to artificially prop up the value of FTT.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ms. Ellison was a key figure in Mr. Bankman-Fried’s business empire. At times, she and Mr. Bankman-Fried were romantically involved, and they lived together in a five-bedroom penthouse in the Bahamas, where FTX was based.</p><p>Ms. Ellison met Mr. Bankman-Fried at the quantitative trading firm Jane Street, where she worked after graduating from Stanford University. Both were involved in effective altruism — a community focused on using data to maximize the long-term impact of charitable donations.</p><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried left Jane Street and eventually founded Alameda in 2017. Ms. Ellison joined him in 2018 and soon became a member of his tightknit inner circle. She followed him to Hong Kong, and took over as the chief executive of Alameda after Mr. Bankman-Fried founded FTX with Mr. Wang.</p><p>Even as she became a powerful figure in the emerging crypto industry. Ms. Ellison was never a true believer in the technology. “I do think a lot of crypto projects don’t have much real value,” she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfcb9JAgWBs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on FTX’s official podcast in early 2021. She got into crypto, she explained on another episode, because she was hoping to make lots of money to give away as part of her commitment to effective altruism.</p><p>As FTX collapsed, Ms. Ellison gathered a group of Alameda staff members who were working from the company’s office in Hong Kong, and confessed that the firm had used customers’ deposits to fill a shortfall in its accounts, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>A former software engineer at Google, Mr. Wang, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was one of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s closest confidants at FTX. The pair lived together in a luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
