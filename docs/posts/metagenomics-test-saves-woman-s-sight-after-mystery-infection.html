No treatment helped and at one point she even considered having her eye removed.</p><p>It was only after Ellie was offered a &#34;last resort&#34; analysis called metagenomics, that she was diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection which was cured with antibiotics.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s been transformative,&#34; Ellie told the BBC. &#34;I feel so fortunate.&#34;</p><p>Professor Carlos Pavesio, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says Ellie&#39;s case is a &#34;breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases&#34;. </p><p>&#34;There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible,&#34; he says.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>In 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition.</p><p>Ellie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion.</p><p>&#34;It was completely dominating my life,&#34; Ellie says. &#34;I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days.</p><p>&#34;I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn&#39;t feel I was getting any better.&#34;</p><p>The treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.</p><p>Ellie says she eventually reached &#34;breaking point&#34;, and even began considering having her affected eye removed.</p><p>&#34;Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying,&#34; she says, &#34;my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye.&#34;</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 480w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="A close-up of Ellie&#39;s right eye which shows a cataract - a cloudy light blue circle in the centre of the eye - which causes blurry vision" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/623/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg 480w" width="623" height="350"/></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Ellie Irwin</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Ellie&#39;s eye developed a cataract that had to be removed</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>It was one of Ellie&#39;s doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.</p><p>Metagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.</p><p>A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie&#39;s eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Currently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.</p><p>For viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test.
