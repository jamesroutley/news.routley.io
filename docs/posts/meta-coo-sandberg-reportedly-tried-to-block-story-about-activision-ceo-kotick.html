The Journal cited unnamed sources involved in the article and the campaign to stop it.</p><p>Sandberg and Kotick reportedly worked with a team including Facebook and Activision employees to devise a strategy to convince the Mail not to publish the article. Sandberg&#39;s advisors were worried it could reflect poorly on her due to her reputation advocating for women, according to the report.</p><p>Kotick has more recently come under fire for his <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">reported knowledge of sexual misconduct allegations</a> at Activision.</p><p>&#34;Sheryl Sandberg never threatened the MailOnline&#39;s business relationship with Facebook in order to influence an editorial decision,&#34; a Meta spokesperson said in a statement. &#34;This story attempts to make connections that don&#39;t exist.&#34;</p><p>There were reportedly &#34;conflicting accounts&#34; about Sandberg&#39;s exact language and whether she &#34;directly invoked Facebook&#34; in speaking with the Mail. But the report said the social media giant&#39;s massive influence on distribution in the news industry could have had a significant impact without a direct threat.</p><p>Activision&#39;s board said in a statement it&#39;s been aware of the reported 2014 incident, seemingly in reference to the restraining order.</p><p>&#34;Around the time of the incident in 2014 , Mr. Kotick notified the senior Independent Director of the Board, has subsequently updated the full Board and has been fully transparent with the Board,&#34; it wrote. &#34;The Board, through its counsel Skadden Arps, has done a thorough examination of the facts and circumstances of the events, satisfied itself that there was no merit to the allegations, and notes that they concern a personal relationship that has nothing to do with the business of the Company. The Board continues to have full confidence in Mr. Kotick&#39;s leadership and his ability to run the Company.&#34;</p><p>Microsoft announced in January it plans to acquire Activision Blizzard in a $68.7 billion all-cash deal.</p><p>The Daily Mail did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Read the full report at <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sandberg-facebook-kotick-activision-blizzard-daily-mail-11650549074" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CNBC?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank"><em><strong>Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.</strong></em></a></p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/05/17/sheryl-sandberg-says-breaking-up-facebook-doesnt-address-several-big-underlying-issues.html">WATCH: Sheryl Sandberg says breaking up Facebook doesn&#39;t address big underlying issues</a></p></div></div></div>
