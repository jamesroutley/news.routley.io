    <h1>Ask HN: How to handle user file uploads?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>hey, i work as an SRE for a company where we allow users to upload media files (e.g. profile picture, attach docs or videos to tasks..the usual). We currently just take a S3 pre-signed URL and let the user upload stuff. Occasionally, limits are set on the &lt;input/&gt; element for file types.</p><p>I don&#39;t feel this is safe enough. I also feel we could do better by optimizing images on the BE, or creating thumbnails for videos. But then there is the question of cost on AWS side.</p><p>Anybody have experience with any of this? I imagine having a big team and dedicated services for media processing could work, but what about small teams?</p><p>All thoughts/discussions are welcome.</p></div></div></div>
