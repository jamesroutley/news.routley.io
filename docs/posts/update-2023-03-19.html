    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><nav></nav><section><ul><li><a href="https://aaronstrick.com/artifacts">Artifacts</a> -- a collection of things around my home</li></ul><p>Updates to my site now show up in the RSS feed.</p><p><strong><em>What&#39;s an update?</em></strong></p><p>It&#39;s when I write about the changes. It&#39;s not an automated thing, cuz that can end up as spammy on RSS. It&#39;s Aaron, the real human writing about the things that have changed recently!</p><p><strong><em>Why?</em></strong></p><p>The feed generator for this site was only including new &#34;posts&#34;. But I rarely write &#34;posts&#34;. This is less of a blog and more of a... ðŸ¤·.</p><p>In any case, sometimes I want to let people know about changes, like the new post I added above. Or some other recent pages like my <a href="https://aaronstrick.com/custom-duds">Custom Duds</a> page.</p><p>The site has had the <a href="https://aaronstrick.com/log">log</a> for a while, but only recently I had the idea that I could manually curate and write updates that would be included in the RSS feed. I&#39;ve seen similar ideas like &#34;Recently&#34; posts, but that didn&#39;t seem right for me. I wasn&#39;t sure how I wanted &#34;updates&#34; to fit into the taxonomy of content on this site, until now.</p><p>So this is where I landed.</p><p><strong><em>Neat!</em></strong></p><p>Thanks me. I&#39;d actually love for other people with digital gardens, portfolios, and other sites that don&#39;t fit into the &#34;blog&#34; mold to do something similar. Lemme get curated updates about changes on your site through RSS!!</p><p>I plan to make a more traditional &#34;post&#34; about this idea soon that hashes out some thoughts and encourages others to do similar, but we&#39;ll see if that ever happens...</p><p><strong><em>The Link!</em></strong></p><p>Here&#39;s the (<a href="https://aaronstrick.com/rss.xml">rss</a> link!)</p></section></div></div>
