    <h1>Ask HN: What&#39;s a good business model for selling standalone software?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello all!</p><p>We are selling standalone boring, mainly desktop (although it runs on beefier laptops as well) software. It&#39;s for Windows and written in boring technologies (C99 for the engine and C# for GUI).
We are considering various business models when it comes to selling it in the future as our current one causes a lot of problems. Some options and thoughts I have about them right now:</p><p>1)What I call a &#34;classical model&#34; which we tried so far: release 1.0 version, sell it for a fixed price. Continue to support it for a while with bugfixes/features. At some point move to developing 2.0 version, sell it again (giving discounts for current 1.0 customers).</p><p>Advantages: simple, the customers can use software they purchased forever</p><p>Disadvantages: at some point you need to start collecting features/development for the next version. This means you will not be shipping new things for a while and &#34;sit&#34; on developments in house. This creates numerous problems, the most severe are: I)you are releasing all the new things at once making the release period hell as all the bugs/suggestions/problems hit you at one point in time and II) you can&#39;t give customers what they want/need immediately even if they want to pay for it right now as you need a significant improvements for the next version. III) You don&#39;t get quick feedback from the customers (only from testers which will always be less complete) about the things you are working on. It may turn out you have spent a few months working on something people don&#39;t really want or they want it in a different way.</p><p>2)Pure subscription.</p><p>Advantages: I)Everyone is on the newest version all the time II)Everyone can cancel/renew at any point III)Incentives aligned: developers can ship new stuff immediately, no reason to sit on new developments</p><p>Disadvantages: you can&#39;t purchase software and &#34;own it&#34;. I like the idea that software once purchased can be run in 3-5-10 years from now and it&#39;s not developers&#39; business when/how you choose to run it.</p><p>3)Some mix of the above. For example one time purchase and then subscription for updates.</p><p>Potential problems:</p><p>I)Difficult to determine what happens to people who cancel subscription (do they get the latest version at the time - that&#39;s difficult to support, what they need to pay if they renew in a few months?)</p><p>II)What happens when someone want to jump from subscription to one-time payment + updates?</p><p>III)It&#39;s seems to be recipe for a situation where there are 100s of &#34;current versions&#34; people are running and that&#39;s very difficult to support. It would be nice if everyone is on a newest one (or some ancient one that doesn&#39;t need support anymore).</p><p>It seems like it&#39;s very difficult to choose a business model that let people &#34;own&#34; the software but which also keeps incentives for the developers to ship new developments regularly. I guess that can be worked around with frequent release schedule (so you don&#39;t sit on stuff for too long) but that&#39;s very difficult to accomplish in a small development team.</p><p>I also think in case of various subscription/subscription hybrid ideas it&#39;s very important to be very clear about the policy towards people who cancel/want to renew after some time.</p><p>Any advice/suggestions are much appreciated!</p></div></div></div>
