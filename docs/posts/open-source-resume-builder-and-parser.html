What is a resume builder? Why resume builder is better than resume template doc?</h3><div><p>There are two ways to create a resume today. One option is to use a resume template, such as an office/google doc, and customize it according to your needs. The other option is to use a resume builder, an online tool that allows you to input your information and automatically generates a resume for you.</p><p>Using a resume template requires manual formatting work, like copying and pasting text sections and adjusting spacing, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. It is easy to run into formatting issues, such as using different bullet points or font styles after copying and pasting. On the other hand, a resume builder like OpenResume saves time and prevents formatting mistakes by automatically formatting the resume. It also offers the convenience of easily changing font types or sizes with a simple click. In summary, a resume builder is easier to use compared to a resume template.</p></div></div><div><h3>Q2. What uniquely sets OpenResume apart from other resume builders and templates?</h3><div><p>Other than OpenResume, there are some great free resume builders out there, e.g. <a href="https://rxresu.me/" target="_blank">Reactive Resume</a>,<!-- --> <a href="https://flowcv.com/" target="_blank">FlowCV</a>. However, OpenResume stands out with 2 distinctive features:</p> <p><span>1. OpenResume is designed specifically for the U.S. job market and best practices.</span></p><p><span>2. OpenResume is super privacy focus.</span> </p></div></div><div><h3>Q3. Who created OpenResume and why?</h3><p>OpenResume was created by<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/xitanggg" target="_blank">Xitang Zhao</a> and designed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imzhi" target="_blank">Zhigang Wen</a> as a weekend project. As immigrants to the US, we had made many mistakes when creating our first resumes and applying for internships and jobs. It took us a long while to learn some of the best practices. While mentoring first generation students and reviewing their resumes, we noticed students were making the same mistakes that we had made before. This led us to think about how we can be of help with the knowledge and skills we have gained. We started chatting and working over the weekends that led to OpenResume, where we integrated best practices and our knowledge into this resume builder. Our hope is that OpenResume can help anyone to easily create a modern professional resume that follows best practices and enable anyone to apply for jobs with confidence.</p></div><div><h3>Q4. How can I support OpenResume?</h3><div><p>The best way to support OpenResume is to share your thoughts and feedback with us to help further improve it. You can send us an email at<!-- --> <a href="mailto:hello@open-resume.com" target="_blank">hello@open-resume.com</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/xitanggg/open-resume/issues/new" target="_blank">open an issue</a> <!-- -->at our Github repository. Whether you like it or not, we would love to hear from you.</p><p>Another great way to support OpenResume is by spreading the words. Share it with your friends, on social media platforms, or with your school’s career center. Our goal is to reach more people who struggle with creating their resume, and your word-of-mouth support would be greatly appreciated. If you use Github, you can also show your support by<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/xitanggg/open-resume" target="_blank">giving the project a star</a> <!-- -->to help increase its popularity and reach.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
