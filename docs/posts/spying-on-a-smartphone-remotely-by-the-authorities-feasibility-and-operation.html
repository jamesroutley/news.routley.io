    <h1>Spying on a smartphone remotely by the authorities: feasibility and operation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
                
<p>French lawmakers agreed to a justice reform bill that includes a provision granting police the power to remotely activate suspects&#39; geolocation, microphone and camera (<a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2023/07/06/france-set-to-allow-police-to-spy-through-phones_6044269_7.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">source</a>).</p>
<p>Following the senators, the deputies also gave their green light to allow certain features of smartphones and other devices to be activated remotely, thus turning them into surveillance trackers.</p>
<p>The deputies determined a list of professions &#34;protected&#34; from any capture: journalists, doctors, notaries, and bailiffs, in addition to lawyers, magistrates and members of parliament.</p>
<p><strong>Technically, will it be possible for them to set up this type of surveillance on phones? If so, how will they go about it?</strong></p>
<p>I wonder how authorities can effectively activate microphones and cameras from popular smartphones using iOS or Android.</p>
<p>I am also wondering how can the privacy of individuals not involved in any criminal activity be safeguarded when such wide-reaching surveillance measures are implemented.</p>
