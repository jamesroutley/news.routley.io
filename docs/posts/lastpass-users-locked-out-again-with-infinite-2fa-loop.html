    <h1>LastPass users locked out (again) with infinite 2FA loop</h1>

<p>LastPass password manager users have been experiencing significant login issues starting early May after being prompted to reset their authenticator apps.</p>
<p>The company first announced that users might need to log back into their LastPass account and reset their multifactor authentication preference due to planned security upgrades <a href="http://twitter.com/LastPassHelp/status/1655716360574337024" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">on May 9</a>.</p>
<p>However, since then, numerous users have been <a href="http://community.logmein.com/t5/LastPass-Support-Discussions/Authenticator-Reset/m-p/305738" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">locked out of their accounts</a> and unable to access their LastPass vault, even after successfully resetting their MFA applications (e.g., LastPass Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator).</p>
<p>Compounding the problem, affected customers cannot seek assistance from support since reaching out to LastPass support requires logging into their accounts which they can&#39;t do because they&#39;re <a href="https://community.logmein.com/t5/LastPass-Support-Discussions/Authenticator-Reset/m-p/305746/highlight/true#M47077" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">locked in an infinite loop</a> of being prompted to reset their MFA authenticator.</p>

<p>&#34;The forced re-sync of MFA is now preventing me from logging in because LastPass won&#39;t recognise the new MFA code,&#34; one user <a href="https://twitter.com/clarbner/status/1671361836854411264" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;After resetting my MFA I completely lost access to my Vault. MasterPW is not working and resetting as well as the reset eMail never gets delivered to me. Cannot contact my &#39;Premium&#39; Support as a Login is required,&#34; another one <a href="https://community.logmein.com/t5/LastPass-Support-Discussions/Authenticator-Reset/m-p/305721/highlight/true#M47059" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;I was prompted to reenter master password then forced to update MFA, which I did successfully, and now I&#39;m not able to login at all. I can&#39;t even open a support ticket because you need to log in in order to do so,&#34; one user <a href="https://community.logmein.com/t5/LastPass-Support-Discussions/Authenticator-Reset/m-p/305732/highlight/true#M47064" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>, asking for help on the LastPass community website.</p>
<p>LastPass says the MFA resets were announced via in-app messages for &#34;several weeks&#34; before the initial announcement.â€‹</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/fabiorossi80/status/1656422269458030594" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt="LastPass tweet reply" height="344" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1109292/2023/LastPass_reply_tweet.png" width="573"/></a></p>
<p>This has prodded LastPass to release several advisories about the security upgrades explaining that this is being done to increase password iterations to the new default of 600,000 rounds</p>
<p>&#34;To increase the security of your master password, LastPass utilizes a stronger-than-typical version of Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF2),&#34; explains a <a href="https://support.lastpass.com/s/document-item?language=en_US&amp;bundleId=lastpass&amp;topicId=LastPass/about-password-iterations.html&amp;_LANG=enus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">LastPass support bulletin</a> sent to impacted users.</p>
<p>&#34;At its most basic, PBKDF2 is a &#39;password-strengthening algorithm&#39; that makes it difficult for a computer to check that any 1 password is the correct master password during a compromising attack.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The forced logout + MFA resync events are taking place as we increase all customer&#39;s password iterations. This has to do with the encryption of your LastPass Vault,&#34; the company <a href="https://twitter.com/LastPass/status/1671340964202307585" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://support.lastpass.com/s/document-item?language=en_US&amp;bundleId=lastpass&amp;topicId=LastPass/why_do_i_have_to_reset_my_authenticator_app.html&amp;_LANG=enus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">another advisory</a>, the company says users are prompted to re-enroll in multifactor authentication for their security when logging in to LastPass.</p>
<p>&#34;You must log in to the LastPass website in your browser and re-enroll your MFA application before you can access LastPass on your mobile device again. You cannot re-enroll using the LastPass browser extension or the LastPass Password Manager app,&#34; the company explains.</p>
<p>The detailed procedure required to reset the pairing between LastPass and the authenticator app (LastPass Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Google Authenticator) is described in detail in <a href="https://support.lastpass.com/s/document-item?language=en_US&amp;bundleId=lastpass&amp;topicId=LastPass/why_do_i_have_to_reset_my_authenticator_app.html&amp;_LANG=enus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">this support document</a>.</p>

<p>The next time you log in to a website or an app using LastPass, you will be prompted to verify your location. When you log in to a website or an app where you used LastPass to log into, you must enter your credentials again and authenticate using your authenticator app.</p>
<p>Users will also be asked to verify their location the next time they log into a website or app using LastPass as an additional security measure.</p>
<p>As part of the same process, users will be required to re-enter their login credentials and authenticate themselves again using their authenticator app.</p>
<p>&#34;Following the 2022 incidents, we sent email and in-product communications to our customer base recommending that they reset their MFA secrets with their preferred Authenticator App as a precautionary measure. This recommendation was also included in the Security Bulletins that we sent to our B2C and B2B customers in early March and a second email communication in early April,&#34; a LastPass spokesperson told BleepingComputer.</p>
<p>&#34;However, a subset of our customers still have not taken this action, so we have been prompting them to take action upon their next log-in to LastPass. We started this in-product prompt back in early June in the hopes that it would get a greater response than our emails.&#34;</p>
<p>These issues come after LastPass disclosed <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lastpass-hackers-stole-customer-vault-data-in-cloud-storage-breach/" target="_blank">a security breach</a> in December 2022 after threat actors stole a large amount of partially encrypted customer information and password vault data.</p>
<p>The December breach resulted from <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lastpass-developer-systems-hacked-to-steal-source-code/" target="_blank">another breach from August 2022</a>, with the attackers gaining access to the company&#39;s encrypted Amazon S3 buckets using stolen data from the first breach.</p>
