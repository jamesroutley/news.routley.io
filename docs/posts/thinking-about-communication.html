<ol><li>I am twitching at twitch.tv/msrobot0 4 days a week. Twitching during a live stream – even when there is no one watching – is really leveling up my programing practice for two reasons.</li></ol>



<p>Narrating what I am doing helps me understand what I am doing and to find better ways to improve – it provides transparency to my process. It reminds me of teachings. When teaching yoga for example you need to explain how to do each kriya and it is a much different experience than just practicing yoga. You get an inner and more nuanced understanding.</p>



<p>I am less likely to write garbage code. Since someone might watch, I take extra care to write good code. Its kind of nuts that I can only behave in the panopticon but it is a good thing to know about myself. I also take care of my environment and use tmux and my nice vi config. </p>



<p>2. I started my newsletter again – It’s going to be short and I hope fun. I am experimenting with different forms of communication – twitch, medium, my blog, my secret blog you can only access with my token (which I will gladly send you if you sign up for my postcard project<a href="https://twitter.com/hackerm0m"> https://twitter.com/hackerm0m</a>)</p>

<p>3. My favorite type of communication is one on one though. This could be hanging out, conversation, carousing, or pair programming.  </p>
