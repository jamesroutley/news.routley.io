    <h1>From Sparkbox to Formidable</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>Several months ago, I handed in my computer and wrapped up my employment at Sparkbox.</p>
<p>I’ve wanted to blog about the change—to share some experiences I had and things I learned along the way. But the words just didn’t seem to want to come.</p>
<p>The truth is, on the night that I submitted my notice, I laid awake in bed unable to sleep. When I joined Sparkbox 7 years ago, it felt so right… I couldn’t imagine ever leaving. And yet, here I was.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I’ve been sleeping better recently. I’m now 3 months into my new role as a (Frontend) Software Engineer at <a href="https://formidable.com/">Formidable</a> and I’m confident that it was the right choice. It feels good!</p>
<p>Change can be intimidating, but it has been necessary for every great opportunity I’ve had. I think its always going to be like that.</p>
