    <h1>NSA urges orgs to use memory-safe programming languages</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The US National Security Agency (NSA) has released guidance encouraging organizations to shift programming languages from the likes of C and C++ to memory safe alternatives – namely C#, Rust, Go, Java, Ruby or Swift.</p>
<p>&#34;NSA recommends that organizations use memory safe languages when possible and bolster protection through code-hardening defenses such as compiler options, tool options, and operating system configurations,&#34; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/News-Highlights/Article/Article/3215760/nsa-releases-guidance-on-how-to-protect-against-software-memory-safety-issues/">advised</a> the agency.</p>
<p>The org&#39;s main concern is that malicious cyber actors may exploit vulnerabilities in poorly managed memory, which occurs more frequently in the languages that give more options and flexibility to the programmer.</p>

    

<p>The NSA gives the examples of a threat actor finding their way into a system through a buffer overflow or by leveraging software memory allocation issues.</p>

        


        

<p>Meanwhile, memory safe languages use a combination of compile time and runtime checks that automatically protect the programmer from introducing mistakes that turn into vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>&#34;Malicious cyber actors can exploit these vulnerabilities for remote code execution or other adverse effects, which can often compromise a device and be the first step in large-scale network intrusions,&#34; <a target="_blank" href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/10/2003112742/-1/-1/0/CSI_SOFTWARE_MEMORY_SAFETY.PDF">said</a> [PDF] the NSA.</p>

        

<p>Well, obviously that is best avoided.</p>

<p>NSA cybersecurity technical director Neal Ziring said consistent use of memory safe language and other protections was necessary when developing software to eliminate such vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>However, the NSA did recognize that &#34;memory safe&#34; is a bit of a misnomer and the concept exists on a spectrum.</p>
<p>Being memory safe also comes with its own challenges – extreme levels of inherent protection have the adverse effect of being difficult to compile, and costly. And shifting from one language to another is a right old pain in the ASCII, if even possible at times.</p>
<p>Rust users have tripled between Q1 2020 and Q1 2022, according to analyst firm <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3661248/developer-survey-javascript-and-python-reign-but-rust-is-rising.html">SlashData.</a> Go has also been prolific, it was clocked as having a community of 3.3 million developers. JavaScript took its decade-long spot as the most-popular language with 17.5 million developers.</p>

        

<p>While the languages are ubiquitous, the NSA&#39;s assertion that C and C++ are particularly problematic is a popular opinion. Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich laid out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/20/rust_microsoft_c/">his case</a> in September that it&#39;s time to halt any new projects in the two time-tested languages.</p>
<p>The CTO did acknowledge that although he&#39;ll bias new tools towards Rust, there exists an &#34;enormous amount of C/C++ that will be maintained and evolved for decades (or longer.)&#34; Russinovich himself had added to his already 85,000 lines of Sysinternals C/C++ code just the night prior to his tweet.</p>
<p>&#34;I think NSA is doing the right thing,&#34; CISO of cybersecurity firm Acronis, Kevin Reed, told <i>The Register.</i></p>
<p>&#34;Mitigations like address space layout randomization (ASLR) and stack guard are kind of a band-aid, not a full solution; moving to a memory-safe language is a much better one,&#34; added Reed, before echoing Russinovich&#39;s sentiments.</p>
<p>&#34;I doubt we&#39;ll see immediate effects because the amount of C and C++ code written over the years is immense and even if we all start using Rust and Go tomorrow, it&#39;ll take decades before we clean up this mess,&#34; said Reed. ®</p>
