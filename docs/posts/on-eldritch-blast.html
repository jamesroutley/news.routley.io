    <h1>On Eldritch Blast</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>I’ve played Dungeons and Dragons for many years,
in multiple editions and campaigns, and on both sides of the DM screen.</p>
<details>
  <summary>D&amp;D for the unfamiliar</summary>
<p>Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop role-playing game,
typically involving a cast of characters in a fantasy setting.
The players describe how their characters interact with the world:
what the character says, does, thinks.
The dungeonmaster (DM) takes the role of “the rest of the world”,
describing what the characters perceive, who they meet,
and how their actions affect their environment.</p>
<p>Wizards of the Coast owns the D&amp;D intellectual property
and publishes official rule books.
They also publish a free version of the rules
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a>,
covering a subset of the material;
I’ve linked to some subsections below.</p>
<h4 id="d20-tests">D20 Tests</h4>
<p>Many conflicts and challenges are mediated by a set of rules.
The <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#D20Tests" rel="external" target="_blank">D20 Test</a>
involves rolling a 20-sided die (d20),
adding some character-dependent bonuses,
and comparing the sum to a target.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
If the sum meets or exceeds the target, the action is a success.
This evens the playing field between players and the DM,
forcing everyone to improvise.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>For instance, a character might cast a <em>firebolt</em> spell
to light a distant brazier.
The DM might decide, based on the distance and size,
the brazier takes a 15 to hit. The player would roll a 1d20,
add a spellcasting modifier (say, +2),
and state the number; if they got 15 or more, the brazier lights.</p>
<h4 id="character-class">Character class</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/character-classes" rel="external" target="_blank"><em>Character class</em></a>
is one of the other core rule sets.
The <em>class</em> describes part of a character’s backstory
and provides rules for their heroic abilities.
A character might be a well-trained <strong>fighter</strong>,
a scholarly <strong>wizard</strong>, a well-spoken <strong>bard</strong>,
or a pious <strong>cleric</strong>.</p>
<p>Or perhaps they made a pact with an otherworldy entity,
to provide some service in exchange for magical powers:
a <strong>warlock</strong>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</details>
<p>As a player, I often create and play a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/character-classes#Warlock" rel="external" target="_blank">warlock</a>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
In addition to the storytelling hook that the pact provides,
the mechanics reinforce a play style that works for me.
<em>Eldritch Blast</em> lets me feel consistently helpful in combat;
and most of the mechanical decision-making is front-loaded into level up,
making it easier for me to stay in character at the table.</p>

<h2 id="i-cast-eldritch-blasttypography">“I cast <em>eldritch blast</em>”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/spell-descriptions#EldritchBlast" rel="external" target="_blank"><em>Eldritch blast</em></a> is the warlock’s signature cantrip –
it doesn’t show up on any other class’s spell lists.
There’s a bit of a meme of warlocks “just” casting <em>eldritch blast</em>
in combat situations, or at least going to it as a default.</p>
<p>In my experience, the meme is justified – but so is the choice
to cast the spell!
<em>Eldritch blast</em> provides more consistency than other cantrips,
and can be extremely effective if the warlock is built for it.</p>
<h3 id="consistent-performance">Consistent performance</h3>
<p><em>Eldritch blast</em> stands out from other cantrips by having Big Damage Dice:
a ranged d10, while most other ranged cantrips use a d8 or d6.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/spell-descriptions#Firebolt" rel="external" target="_blank"><em>Firebolt</em></a> is the exception; it also uses a d10.</p>
<p>The difference in damage is accentuated at higher character levels.
Most damage-forward cantrips deal NdX on a hit, where N scales up
at level milestones;
for instance, <em>firebolt</em> starts with 1d10 fire damage on hit,
then becomes 2d10, 3d10, etc.</p>
<p><em>Eldritch blast</em> works differently.
Instead of dealing Nd10 on a hit, the caster fires N beams of force.
Each beam can hit (or miss) indepenently, each dealing 1d10 damage on a hit.</p>
<p>The N is the same for <em>eldritch blast</em> and other cantrips,
so the possible range of damage is the same as <em>firebolt</em>.
The <em>mean</em> damage is the same, too:
over a large number of casts of the spell,
<em>firebolt</em> and <em>eldritch blast</em> will do the same amount of damage.</p>
<p>However, <em>eldritch blast</em> will hit for <strong>some</strong> damage more frequently.
More rolls, less damage for each.</p>

  <summary>About this chart</summary>
<p>The above chart
shows the percentage of rolls (Y-axis) that will result
in the given amount of damage (X-axis)
for each of two cantrips, <em>eldritch blast</em> and <em>firebolt</em>.</p>
<p>Both of these spells use an attack roll:
the caster rolls 1d20 and adds their spell attack modifier.
The roll “hits” (does damage) if the sum meets or exceeds the target’s armor class (AC).</p>
<p>Mathematically, this is the same as subtracting the modifier
from the target’s AC to get a <em>hit threshold</em> –
the number the die needs to show to indicate a hit.
I’ve used the hit threshold here to keep the number of knobs small.</p>
<p>The number N (beams/dice) is the level-up parameter.
<em>Eldritch blast</em> creates one beam at 1st level,
two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level,
and four beams at 17th level.
<em>Firebolt</em> deals 1d10, 2d10, 3d10, 4d10 damage at the same level thresholds.</p>
<p>The <em>rolls</em> knob allows you to configure the simulation fidelity.
The chart is based on a random number generator,
not an analytical solution; this sets how many times to cast each spell.</p>
<p>If you run through an analytical solution, you’ll realize the <em>mean damage</em>
is the same.
The numbers reported above represent the sample means –
any difference comes from randomness in the generated data.</p>
</details>
</div>
<p>At low levels (N=1), <em>eldritch blast</em> and <em>firebolt</em> behave identically.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Once the character hits level 5 (N=2),
there’s a dramatic difference in reliability-to-hit:
<em>eldritch blast</em> will hit twice as often, though with less damage.</p>
<p>I like being able to reliably contribute <em>something</em> to combat encounters.
I’ve played characters who could not reliabily damage or buff;
being able to hit often, even for less damage, lets me feel like I’m helping out the party.</p>
<h3 id="warlock-confluence">Warlock confluence</h3>
<p>“Consistent damage” alone is a nice reason to use <em>eldritch blast</em>.
But there’s additional options for warlocks that make the spell even better.</p>
<p>Damage <a href="https://donjon.bin.sh/5e/spells/" rel="external" target="_blank">cantrips</a>
are generally structured as pick-2: “ranged”, “d10”, and “extra effect”.
<em>Chill touch</em> is one example of this tradeoff:
the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/spells#ChillTouch" rel="external" target="_blank">2014 rules</a> list it as a ranged attack, dealing 1d8 and prohibiting hit-point recovery,
while the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/spell-descriptions#ChillTouch" rel="external" target="_blank">2024 rules</a> change it to melee, but bump damage up to d10.</p>
<p><em>Eldritch blast</em> and <em>firebolt</em> both occupy the “ranged d10”
space. Warlocks can improve either cantrip with Eldritch Invocations
(a class feature): options include
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/character-classes#EldritchSpear" rel="external" target="_blank">Eldritch Spear</a>, to extend the range,
or <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/character-classes#EldritchSpear" rel="external" target="_blank">Repelling Blast</a>
to move opponents.</p>
<p>Those invocations have similar benefits for any cantrip.
But one invocation, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/character-classes#AgonizingBlast" rel="external" target="_blank">Agonizing Blast</a>
, works particularly well for <em>eldritch blast</em>.</p>
<p>Agonizing Blast allows the character to add their
Charisma modifier to damage rolls for a chosen cantrip.
(Charisma is the key stat for warlocks, so the modifier is expected to be large.)
Since <em>eldritch blast</em> involves multiple damage rolls –
one roll for each beam – the level scaling is even steeper.</p>
<div>
<h4>With Agonizing Blast</h4>
<canvas width="100" height="30"></canvas>

</div>
<p>The structure here, “N attacks, each with +mod to hit and +mod damage”,
is the same as a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/character-classes#Fighter" rel="external" target="_blank">fighter</a> with the Extra Attack feature.
Arguably <em>eldritch blast</em> is even better: it only requires one hand
to cast and operates at range.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="choices">Choices, choices</h2>
<p>So, in combat, warlocks have a pretty easy set of choices:
cast <em>eldritch blast</em>, or spend a spell slot.</p>
<p>In general, I see this as a theme:
warlocks have fewer short- and medium-term choices than other classes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many classes have additional resources to manage on top of spell slots:
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/character-classes#Fighter" rel="external" target="_blank">maneuver dice</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/character-classes#Druid" rel="external" target="_blank">Wild Shape charges</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/character-classes#Monk" rel="external" target="_blank">ki points</a>,
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/character-classes#Sorcerer" rel="external" target="_blank">sorcery points</a>.</p>
<p>Warlocks just have Pact Magic spell slots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other casters must space out their spell slots
between long rests: “Will we be getting into another encounter today?”</p>
<p>Warlocks recharge spell slots after a short rest, so it’s easier to say
“yeah sure I’ll spend this.” Use it or lose it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some casters must prepare spells at each long rest.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Warlocks (like sorcerers and bards) prepare their spells during level-up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The flip side is that warlocks have more long-term choices to make.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most classes pick their subclass, and then don’t have more class-related choices
to make at level-up.</p>
<p>Via Eldritch Invocations, warlocks have to
build ~half of their class features from the list, and reevaluate at each level-up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="works-for-me">Works for me</h2>
<p>This kind of “set up and run” play style isn’t for everyone.
I like that I can mostly worry about mechanics offline,
and then come to a session with a short list of well-understood options.</p>
<p>If that appeals to you, try a warlock for your next character!</p>
<p>If you have other thoughts on warlocks, D&amp;D,
or my horrible Javascript to make the above charts, let me know!</p>
