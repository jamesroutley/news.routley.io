          <p dir="auto">Since my last message, Google has been rolling out a fix. We&#39;ve observed the progress over the last hours, and it seems like this issue is fixed for the vast majority of users. I&#39;ll go ahead and close this bug as fixed.</p>
<p dir="auto">I&#39;ll also unlock this issue in case there&#39;s still a large group of people who still experience blank-page issues on Google Search that can be fixed with a UA spoof. Although, instead of commenting here, I strongly suggest filing a new bug for this, because that&#39;s more likely to get picked up by our triage process, as opposed to just sending me a notification that I might see <em>eventually</em>.</p>
