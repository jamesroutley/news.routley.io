</div><p>Expert sommeliers can take a whiff of a glass of wine and tell you a lot about what&#39;s in your pinot noir or cabernet sauvignon. A team of physicists at CU Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have achieved a similar feat of sensing, only for a much wider range of substances.</p>


										      
																																	<p>The group has developed a new laser-based device that can take any sample of gas and identify a huge variety of the molecules within it. It is sensitive enough to detect those molecules at minute concentrations all the way down to parts per trillion.</p>
<p>Its design is also simple enough that researchers could employ the method quickly and at a low cost in a range of settings, from diagnosing illnesses in human patients to tracking <a href="https://phys.org/tags/greenhouse+gas+emissions/" rel="tag">greenhouse gas emissions</a> from factories.</p>
<p>The study was led by scientists at JILA, a joint research institute between CU Boulder and NIST. The team <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08534-2" target="_blank">published their findings</a> in the journal <i>Nature.</i></p>
<p>&#34;Even today, I still find it unbelievable that the most capable sensing tool can in fact be built with such simplicity, using only mature technical ingredients but tied together with a clever computation algorithm,&#34; said Qizhong Liang, lead author of the research and a doctoral student at JILA.</p>
<p>To show what the tool is capable of, Liang and his colleagues drilled down on an important question in medicine: What&#39;s in the air you breathe out?</p>
<p>The team analyzed breath samples from real human subjects and showed that they could, for example, identify the types of bacteria living in peoples&#39; mouths. The technique could one day help doctors diagnose lung cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and much more.</p>
<p>Physicist Jun Ye, senior author of the study, said the new work builds on nearly three decades of research into <a href="https://phys.org/tags/quantum+physics/" rel="tag">quantum physics</a> at CU Boulder and NIST—especially around a type of specialized device known as a frequency comb laser.</p>
<p>&#34;The frequency comb laser was originally invented for <a href="https://phys.org/tags/optical+atomic+clocks/" rel="tag">optical atomic clocks</a>, but very early on, we identified its powerful application for molecular sensing,&#34; said Ye, a fellow of JILA and NIST and professor adjoint of physics at CU Boulder.</p>
<p>&#34;Still, it took us 20 years to mature this technique, finally allowing universal applicability for molecular sensing.&#34;</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>A shaking cavity</h2>
<p>To understand how the team&#39;s technology works, it helps to understand that all gases, from pure carbon dioxide to your stinky breath after you eat garlic, carry a fingerprint of sorts.</p>
<p>If you probe those gases with a laser that spans multiple &#34;<a href="https://phys.org/tags/optical+frequencies/" rel="tag">optical frequencies</a>,&#34; or colors, the molecules in the gas samples will absorb that light at different frequencies. It&#39;s almost like a burglar leaving behind a thumbprint at a crime scene.</p>
<p>In a previous study, for example, Liang and his colleagues used this laser absorption detection principle to <a href="https://phys.org/news/2023-05-breathalyzer-disease-covid-real-time-cancer.html">screen human breath samples</a> for signs of SARS-CoV-2 infections.</p>
<p>Frequency combs are well suited to that technique because, unlike traditional lasers, they emit pulses of light in thousands to millions of colors at the same time. (JILA&#39;s Jan Hall pioneered these lasers, winning the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in 2005).</p>
<p>But to detect molecules at low concentrations, those lasers must also pass through the gas sample over distances of miles or more so that the molecules can absorb enough light.</p>
<p>To be practical, scientists must realize that distance within containers for gases that are measured on the scale of a foot.</p>
<p>&#34;We enclose the gas sample with a pair of high-reflectivity mirrors, forming an &#39;optical cavity,&#39;&#34; Liang said. &#34;The comb light can now bounce between those mirrors several thousand times to effectively increase its absorption path length with the molecules.&#34;</p>
<p>Or that&#39;s the goal. In practice, optical cavities are tricky to work with and eject laser beams if they aren&#39;t properly matched to the resonant modes of the cavity. As a result, scientists previously could only use a narrow range of comb light, and detect a narrow range of molecules, in a single test.</p>
<p>In the new study, Liang and his colleagues overcame this longstanding challenge. They presented a new technique they named Modulated Ringdown Comb Interferometry, or MRCI (pronounced &#34;mercy&#34;). Rather than keep its optical cavity steady, the team periodically changed its size. This jiggling, in turn, allowed the cavity to accept a much wider spectrum of light.</p>
<p>The team then deciphered the complicated laser intensity patterns emerging from the cavity with computational algorithms to determine the samples&#39; chemical contents.</p>
<p>&#34;We can now use mirrors with even larger reflectivity and send in comb light with even broader spectral coverage,&#34; Liang said. &#34;But this is just the beginning. Even better sensing performance can be established using MRCI.&#34;</p>

																																			<h2>A sensor for breath</h2>
<p>The team is now turning its new gas sniffer on human breath.</p>
<p>&#34;Exhaled breath is one of the most challenging gas samples to be measured, but characterizing its molecular compositions is highly important for its powerful potential for medical diagnostics,&#34; said Apoorva Bisht, co-author of the research and a doctoral student in Ye&#39;s lab.</p>
<p>Bisht, Liang and Ye are now collaborating with researchers at CU Anschutz Medical Campus and Children&#39;s Hospital Colorado to use MRCI to analyze a range of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/breath+samples/" rel="tag">breath samples</a>. They are examining whether MRCI can distinguish samples taken from children with pneumonia from those taken from children with asthma.</p>
<p>The group is also analyzing the breath of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/lung+cancer/" rel="tag">lung cancer</a> patients before and after tumor removal surgery and is exploring whether the technology can diagnose people in early stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>
<p>&#34;It will be tremendously important to validate our approach on real world human subjects,&#34; Ye said. &#34;Through close collaboration with our medical colleagues at CU Anschutz, we are committed to developing the full potential of this technique for medical diagnosis.&#34;</p>
