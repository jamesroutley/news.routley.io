    <h1>Jack&#39;s Ass</h1>

<p>2023/02</p>
<p>Jack is my friend, he had hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Hemorrhoid is one of the experiences which could be legitimately called: &#34;the pain in the ass&#34;. Something grows in the ass and causes pain.</p>
<h2><a name="1" aria-hidden="true" href="#1"><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>1</h2>
<p>One day in a coffee shop, Jack and I were chattering.</p>
<p>I said: &#34;Damn! Lisp is so cool! I wish I could have known it earlier!&#34;</p>
<p>Then Jack said: &#34;Is it cool enough to solve my ass problem?&#34;</p>
<p>That was a medical problem, and I ain&#39;t no medic. Although I deeply know that Lisp is cool enough to solve it, I choose to hold my impulse and asked:</p>
<p>&#34;What did your doctor say?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He said this is not curable by any known medicine. Once it is there, it is there. The only way to solve this problem is to cut it out. I said no.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And I&#39;m in pain! I can&#39;t sit for too long, otherwise, my ass will blow up.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Can&#39;t you just keep standing?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That will hurt my knees! I have tried to set a bunch of timers, but they were a mess.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;OK, that&#39;s easy, Lisp can do it, I assure you,&#34; I said.</p>
<p>Then Jack paid for the coffee, and I sent him the software to cure his ass by the end of the day. It&#39;s just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" rel="nofollow">Pomodoro</a> timer that reminds him to stand up every 25 minutes, written in Lisp with SDL2 and Cairo Graphics.</p>
<p>I also have written a detailed manual to explain how to install the software with SBCL, SDL2, Cairo Graphics, and some other dependencies. Anyone with some basic computer knowledge could manage to install it.</p>

<p>A month later, I met Jack in the same coffee shop.</p>
<p>&#34;How&#39;s your ass?&#34; I asked.</p>
<p>&#34;The hemorrhoids were gone.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;See? I told you, Lisp is cool!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No, I let the doctor cut my ass.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oh, Why&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I spent a whole day sitting in front of the computer to install SDL2, SDL_Mixer, SDL_Image, Cairo, SBCL, Quicklisp, and many other shits to get your shitty software working. Suddenly, a huge pain came from my ass. When I stood up, blood was all over the chair. Then I called the ambulance.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No! Uh...&#34;</p>
<h2><a name="3" aria-hidden="true" href="#3"><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>3</h2>
<p>That night, I couldn&#39;t sleep.</p>
<p>Jack&#39;s wounded ass is all my fault.</p>
<p>So I decided to never ask non-wizard users to install any dependencies again.</p>
<p>After uncountable days and nights sitting in front of the computer, I made it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a huge pain came from my ass.</p>
