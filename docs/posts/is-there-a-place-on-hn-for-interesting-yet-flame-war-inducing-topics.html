    <h1>Ask HN: Is there a place on HN for interesting yet flame-war inducing topics?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I ask this (as truly an open question, without knowing the answer) because of 2 recent posts on HN that got flagged, one a thought-provoking article by a Yale student titled &#34;Abolish Yale&#34;, and the other about the California proposal to use the recently-novel &#34;citizen deputization&#34; legal techniques pioneered by Texas, but this time to restrict assault weapons.<p>The reason I ask this is because there appear to be a growing collection of topics that <i>are</i> interesting and deserving of debate, but because they are hot-button issues they often devolve into flame wars. I&#39;ve been on the other side of this as well, where I commented that I flagged a DEI-focused article because, while I thought the topic itself was interesting, it seems comment threads on DEI topics <i>always</i> devolve into uninteresting flame wars, and that I rarely learn something new from these threads.</p><p>I didn&#39;t feel that about the 2 topics today that got flagged - indeed, there were a bunch of comments that let me to going down Wikipedia rabbit holes and I learned a ton, and for both of these topics the first I heard about them was on HN.</p><p>So my question to the HN community is whether you think there is some way (e.g. feature changes, &#34;sub topics&#34;, etc.) to host these topics that seem fundamentally relevant to the HN audience, but which are so difficult to have debate about without getting flooded by low quality comments?</p></td></div></div>
