Early-onset breast, tracheal, bronchus and lung, stomach and colorectal cancers showed the highest mortality and DALYs in 2019. Globally, the incidence rates of early-onset nasopharyngeal and prostate cancer showed the fastest increasing trend, whereas early-onset liver cancer showed the sharpest decrease. Early-onset colorectal cancers had high DALYs within the top five ranking for both men and women. High-middle and middle Sociodemographic Index (SDI) regions had the highest burden of early-onset cancer. The morbidity of early-onset cancer increased with the SDI, and the mortality rate decreased considerably when SDI increased from 0.7 to 1. The projections indicated that the global number of incidence and deaths of early-onset cancer would increase by 31% and 21% in 2030, respectively. Dietary risk factors (diet high in red meat, low in fruits, high in sodium and low in milk, etc), alcohol consumption and tobacco use are the main risk factors underlying early-onset cancers.</p><p id="p-5"><strong>Conclusion</strong> Early-onset cancer morbidity continues to increase worldwide with notable variances in mortality and DALYs between areas, countries, sex and cancer types.

Early-onset breast, tracheal, bronchus and lung, stomach and colorectal cancers showed the highest mortality and burden in 2019. Countries with a high-middle and middle Sociodemographic Index and individuals aged 40–49 years were particularly affected. Dietary risk factors (diet high in red meat, low in fruits, high in sodium and low in milk, etc), alcohol consumption and tobacco use are the main risk factors underlying early-onset cancers.</p></li></ul></div><div id="sec-7"><h4>HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY</h4><ul id="list-3"><li id="list-item-3"><p id="p-8">This study suggests that it is necessary to conduct prospective life-course cohort studies to explore the aetiologies of early-onset cancers, and each country should adjust their prevention strategies based on the characteristics of early-onset cancer. Meanwhile, encouraging a healthy lifestyle could reduce early-onset cancer disease burden.</p></li></ul></div></div><div id="sec-8"><h2>Introduction</h2><p id="p-9">Globally, cancer is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, resulting in a large disease burden.<a id="xref-ref-1-1" href="#ref-1">1</a> According to Global Cancer Statistics 2020, breast cancer with the largest number of 2.3 million new cases accounted for 11.7% of all cancers, followed by lung cancer (11.4%), colorectal cancer (CRC) (10.0 %), while lung cancer was the main cause of cancer death (1.8 million deaths, 18%), followed by CRC (9.4%), liver (8.3%) cancer.<a id="xref-ref-1-2" href="#ref-1">1</a> Cancer is generally more prevalent in adults over 50 years, but the incidence of early-onset cancer (&lt;50 years) has increased worldwide.<a id="xref-ref-2-1" href="#ref-2">2</a> In comparison to later-onset cancer, the increase of early-onset cancer has significant personal and societal ramifications. Moreover, early-onset cancer and the adverse impacts of some corresponding cancer treatments may result in additional health issues during subsequent life cycle,<a id="xref-ref-3-1" href="#ref-3">3</a> which would considerably increase the disease burden associated with early-onset cancers.</p><p id="p-10">Currently, it was reported that the promotion of cancer screening strategies and the exposure to risk factors in early life or young adulthood may increase incidence of early-onset cancer.<a id="xref-ref-4-1" href="#ref-4">4</a> For example, increasing the proportion of cervical cancer screening among women aged 21–65 years was a Healthy People 2020 objective for use of cancer screening tests in the USA,<a id="xref-ref-5-1" href="#ref-5">5</a> and the American Cancer Society (ACS) has recommended initiating CRC screening at age 45 years instead of 50 years.<a id="xref-ref-6-1" href="#ref-6">6</a> For breast cancer, in countries with favourable healthcare conditions, it is recommended that women between the ages of 40 and 49 undergo a screening test for breast cancer every 1–2 years.<a id="xref-ref-7-1" href="#ref-7">7–11</a> Furthermore, changes in diet, lifestyle and environment since the turn of the 20th century, resulting in increased rates of obesity, physical inactivity, westernised diets and environmental pollution, may have affected the incidence of early-onset cancer.<a id="xref-ref-12-1" href="#ref-12">12</a> Additionally, alcohol, smoking and detrimental pregnancy exposures may have also affected the incidence of early-onset cancer.<a id="xref-ref-2-2" href="#ref-2">2 13</a></p><p id="p-11">The majority of previous studies focused on regional and national variations in the incidence and death of all-age cancer,<a id="xref-ref-14-1" href="#ref-14">14</a> and only a small number of studies examined the worldwide epidemiology and disease burden of early-onset cancer. A systematic examination on the global epidemiology of early-onset cancer can aid in the efficient implementation of prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment initiatives. Thus, we conducted this study to describe the global burden of early-onset cancer based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study for 29 cancers in 204 countries and regions with the aim of shedding light on early-onset global cancer prevention and control.</p></div><div id="sec-9"><h2>Material and methods</h2><div id="sec-10"><h3>Data source, definition of early-onset cancer and risk factors</h3><p id="p-12">We obtained the data from the GBD 2019 database (<a href="http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019">http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019</a>). The incidence, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and risk factor proportion were extracted directly from GBD 2019. All rates are reported per 100k population. A total of 29 early-onset cancers were ascertained from administrative data according to International Classification of Disease 9th revision (ICD-9) and 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, the ICD codes of 29 cancers are shown in <a id="xref-supplementary-material-1-1" href="#DC1">online supplemental table S1</a>. Early-onset cancer was defined as cancer cases diagnosed from 14 to 49 years.<a id="xref-ref-15-1" href="#ref-15">15</a> In total, 204 countries were divided into five-level regions based on the Sociodemographic Index (SDI). The Human Development Index (HDI) data were obtained at the national level from the World Bank. Definitions of risk factors and method for calculating the proportions of their attribution in GBD 2019 were detailedly described in <a id="xref-supplementary-material-1-2" href="#DC1">online supplemental methods</a>.</p></div><div id="sec-11"><h3>Statistical analysis</h3><p id="p-14">The incidence rate, death rate and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) were used to quantify the epidemic trends of 29 early-onset cancers. The EAPC formulas were as follows:</p><p id="p-15"><span id="disp-formula-1"><span><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Embedded Image" data-src="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmjonc/2/1/e000049/embed/mml-math-1.gif"/></span></span></p><p id="p-16"><span id="disp-formula-2"><span><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Embedded Image" data-src="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmjonc/2/1/e000049/embed/mml-math-2.gif"/></span></span></p><p id="p-17">The age-standardised rate (ASR)/100k population, including age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardised death rate (ASDR), was estimated with the following formula:</p><p id="p-18"><span id="disp-formula-3"><span><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Embedded Image" data-src="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmjonc/2/1/e000049/embed/mml-math-3.gif"/></span></span></p><p id="p-19">The selected reference standard population was presented in <a id="xref-supplementary-material-1-3" href="#DC1">online supplemental table S2</a>. We explored the associations between EAPCs and HDI in 2019 using Spearman correlation analysis. Additionally, the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model integrating nested Laplace approximations was used to project the morbidity and mortality of the disease burden attributable to early-onset cancer from 2020 to 2030.<a id="xref-ref-16-1" href="#ref-16">16</a> The BAPC model is widely used in analysing and projecting age-stratified cancer incidence and mortality rates, particularly considering the significant demographic changes taking place. The primary advantage of developing the BAPC package is to create efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo-free software specifically designed for routine utilisation in epidemiological applications. This package simplifies the implementation of the BAPC model, enabling the generation of well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts with reasonably narrow ranges of uncertainty. The formula was as follow:</p><p id="p-20"><span id="disp-formula-4"><span><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Embedded Image" data-src="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmjonc/2/1/e000049/embed/mml-math-4.gif"/></span></span></p><p id="p-21">To avoid over dispersion, an independent random effect, <span id="inline-formula-1"><span><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Embedded Image" data-src="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmjonc/2/1/e000049/embed/mml-math-5.gif"/></span></span>, was added into the model:</p><p id="p-22"><span id="disp-formula-5"><span><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Embedded Image" data-src="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmjonc/2/1/e000049/embed/mml-math-6.gif"/></span></span></p><p id="p-23">Data analysis and graphics were conducted using R V.4.2.1 (Lucent Technologies, Jasmine Mountain, USA).

Among them, the early-onset breast cancer had the highest incidence (13.7, 95% uncertainty interval (UI): 12.5 to 15 per 100k) and mortality (3.5, 95% CI: 3.2 to 3.8 per 100k) rates (<a id="xref-supplementary-material-1-5" href="#DC1">online supplemental tables S3 and S4</a>). Globally, the morbidity of early-onset nasopharyngeal cancer (EAPC=2.28%, 95% CI: 2.1% to 2.47%) and prostate cancer (EAPC=2.23%, 95% CI: 1.97% to 2.49%) showed the fastest increasing trends, whereas early-onset liver cancer (EAPC=−2.88%, 95% CI: −3.46% to –2.3%) showed the sharpest decline (<a id="xref-supplementary-material-1-6" href="#DC1">online supplemental table S3</a>). Besides, the number of early-onset cancer deaths in 2019 was 1.06 million, which was an increase of 27.7% from 1990 (<a id="xref-fig-1-2" href="#F1">figure 1C,D</a>). The top four early-onset cancers with the highest mortality and DALYs rates were early-onset breast, tracheal, bronchus and lung (TBL), stomach and CRC cancers (<a id="xref-supplementary-material-1-7" href="#DC1">online supplemental tables S4 and S5</a>). The mortality of early-onset kidney cancer (EAPC=0.81%, 95% CI: 0.70% to 0.92%) and ovarian cancer (EAPC=0.59%, 95% CI: 0.49% to 0.69%) showed the fastest increasing trends, whereas early-onset liver cancer (EAPC=−3.39%, 95% CI: −4.00% to –2.77%) showed the sharpest decline (<a id="xref-supplementary-material-1-8" href="#DC1">online supplemental table S4</a>). In 2019, early-onset breast cancer had the highest ASIR in regions with high SDI, while early-onset TBL cancer had the highest ASIR in high-middle SDI regions (<a id="xref-supplementary-material-1-9" href="#DC1">online supplemental table S6</a>). Early-onset CRC had the highest ASIR in high SDI regions, and stomach cancer had the highest ASIR in high-middle SDI regions in 2019. On the other hand, the highest ASDR for early-onset breast cancer were observed in regions with low and low-middle SDI in 2019.

The analysis of incidence, death and DALYs by location, country and sex revealed that the spectrum of early-onset cancer varied significantly among the regions and nations across the world. Although the global early-onset cancer incidence surpassed 3.26 million in 2019, a 79.1% increase of the incidence in 1990, the mortality number of early-onset cancer only increased by 27.7%. Notably, the prediction model indicated that the age brackets of 40–44 and 45–49 will represent a significant proportion of the population affected by early-onset cancer morbidity and mortality in the next 10 years.</p><p id="p-41">Significant regional variations in the early-onset cancer spectrum can be ascribed to the local environment, lifestyle and level of available medical treatment. For example, in high-income North America, Australasia and Western Europe with high degree of development, the ASIRs in 2019 were higher than 125 per 100k, while the lowest were in Western Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Sub-Saharan Africa (&lt;50 per 100k), which were similar to the ASIR of all-age cancer.<a id="xref-ref-14-2" href="#ref-14">14</a> At present, cancer control efforts, preventive measures and strategies in Africa are inadequate, and the majority of Africa countries have limited cancer registries, and their cancer reporting systems are poorly organised.<a id="xref-ref-17-1" href="#ref-17">17</a> Besides, most countries in Africa do not have well established health insurance systems to cover the cost of cancer screening.<a id="xref-ref-18-1" href="#ref-18">18</a> The afore-mentioned factors could be contributing factors to the Africa’s low ASIRs for early-onset cancer. On the whole, the more developed the country and region, the higher the incidence of early-onset cancer. The rising incidence of early-onset cancers may partially attribute to increasing uptake of screening and early detection in developed regions and countries<a id="xref-ref-2-3" href="#ref-2">2</a>; however, only a small number of countries and certain types of cancer (including cervical cancer, breast cancer and CRC<a id="xref-ref-19-1" href="#ref-19">19</a>) have implemented a screening strategy for individuals with cancer who are under the age of 50. Beyond this, western diet risk and lifestyle risk factors promoted the incidence rate of early-onset cancers.<a id="xref-ref-1-3" href="#ref-1">1</a> However, as SDI values increased, there was a sharp decrease in ASDR for early-onset cancer in Western Europe, high-income Asia Pacific and high-income North America regions. Furthermore, the projections indicated that the global morbidity and ASIR from early-onset cancer would increase over the next 10 years, while there would be a slight increase in mortality and ASDR compared to 2019 due to changing demographics over the following 10 years. Our results suggested that the incidences of early-onset nasopharynx cancer and prostate cancer displayed the most rapid upward trends in morbidity from 1990 to 2019. Despite the regional clustering and ethnic susceptibility of nasopharynx cancer, its underlying causes are currently unknown. While genetic factors, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and environmental factors are thought to be significant contributors to the development of nasopharynx cancer, more research is required to establish exact aetiological roles of early-onset nasopharynx cancer.<a id="xref-ref-20-1" href="#ref-20">20</a> Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, which began in developed countries in the 1990s, contributed to the incidence of early-onset prostate cancer.<a id="xref-ref-20-2" href="#ref-20">20</a> However, it would be incorrect to solely attribute the entire increase in early-onset prostate cancer since 1986 to PSA screening. Besides advancements in screenings and diagnostics, other possible reasons for variations in health outcomes could be differences in age demographics and the presence of genetic and lifestyle risk factors.<a id="xref-ref-20-3" href="#ref-20">20</a></p><p id="p-42">Among 29 early-onset cancers, breast cancer had the highest morbidity, mortality and DALYs. In 1990, North America regions with high-income levels had the highest rate of early-onset breast cancer (30.6 per 100k), but by 2019, the incidence of early-onset breast cancer (23.1 per 100k) had decreased, although it still remained in third place. It may benefit from the application of early screening programmes of breast cancer in North America regions. In contrast, over the same time period, Asia regions experienced a significant increase in the incidence of early-onset breast cancer, rising from 4.9 to 13.1 per 100k in 1990 to 8.7–15.6 per 100k in 2019. The growing prevalence of a westernised lifestyle could be among the factors contributing to the upward trend observed in Asian countries.<a id="xref-ref-21-1" href="#ref-21">21 22</a> Recently, a case–control study of Asian American women (diagnosed at age≤55 years) from the San Francisco Bay Area found that breast cancer risk was marginally increased among foreign-born women (OR=1.40) and twofold among foreign-born Chinese women.<a id="xref-ref-23-1" href="#ref-23">23</a> Thus, the factors (including genetic susceptibility) driving the increasing burden of breast cancer in women of Asian are still unclear. Furthermore, the death of early-onset breast cancer accounted for 32% and 20% among all early-onset cancers in the Oceania and Southeast Asia, respectively. The extensive application and promotion of mammography screening worldwide from 2005 to 2015<a id="xref-ref-24-1" href="#ref-24">24</a> has led to an earlier age of breast cancer screening and higher rates of early-onset breast cancer detection. The most typical country is the USA,<a id="xref-ref-25-1" href="#ref-25">25</a> which began to introduce and promote mammography screening from 1980s. The ACS suggests that women be given the chance to commence yearly screening between the ages of 40–44, and to undergo routine screening mammography from the age of 45 onwards.<a id="xref-ref-20-4" href="#ref-20">20</a> More importantly, it is noteworthy that the incidence of early-onset breast cancer also increased in some countries without the introduction of routine screening,<a id="xref-ref-26-1" href="#ref-26">26</a> suggesting that the change of reproductive factors (younger age at menarche, oral contraceptive use, nulliparity, older age at first birth and never breast feeding), physical indicators (higher BMI) and behaviour factors (physical inactivity and alcohol consumption) during recent decades may have contributed to the increasing incidence of early-onset breast cancer.<a id="xref-ref-2-4" href="#ref-2">2</a> Globally, we found that alcohol use and tobacco were always the leading risk factors for early-onset breast cancer DALYs during 1990–2019. Several previous studies also found that both tobacco use and alcohol consumption increase the risk of developing breast cancer, with tobacco use specifically linked to premenopausal breast cancer<a id="xref-ref-27-1" href="#ref-27">27</a> and alcohol consumption linked to increased risk regardless of menopausal status.<a id="xref-ref-28-1" href="#ref-28">28</a> The above evidences highlights that limiting and quitting alcohol and tobacco may serve as a promising strategy to reduce the growing burden of early-onset breast cancer.</p><p id="p-43">Early-onset TBL cancer had the highest burden in men and secondary cause of death for the overall population. Generally, the incidence of early-onset TBL cancer dropped during 1990–2019, which benefited from tobacco control in recent decades.<a id="xref-ref-29-1" href="#ref-29">29</a> In 1990, the regions of Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, high-income North America and East Asia had the highest ASIR of early-onset TBL cancer among all regions. However, ASIR of early-onset TBL cancer in these regions decreased by 2019. Notedly, lung adenocarcinoma in East Asia, especially among those who have never smoked, tends to have an early onset, which sets it apart from cases observed in other regions.<a id="xref-ref-30-1" href="#ref-30">30</a> The differences in incidence rates may be due to various risk factors, such as genetics and exposure to environmental pollution.<a id="xref-ref-31-1" href="#ref-31">31 32</a> Thus, by examining the molecular characteristics and defining the hallmarks of tumour progression in early-onset TBL cancer, precision medicine and prevention may be a viable approach for managing non-smoking early-onset TBL cancer in East Asia. Globally, the morbidity and mortality of early-onset TBL cancer in men was 1.7 and 1.8 times higher than that of women, respectively, which was mainly attributed to the higher tobacco consumption in men.<a id="xref-ref-33-1" href="#ref-33">33</a> Notably, between 1990 and 2019, smoking continued to be the most significant risk factor for lung cancer among men. Currently, the definition of high-risk or moderate-risk individuals in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for lung cancer screening was restricted to those aged 50 years or older.<a id="xref-ref-34-1" href="#ref-34">34</a> However, it is still to be assessed if lung cancer screening is necessary for populations with a history of long-term and high-dose smoking who are younger than 50 years old. TBL cancer is similarly caused by passive exposure to tobacco smoking, environmental pollution and indoor lampblack pollution,<a id="xref-ref-35-1" href="#ref-35">35</a> particularly in women. And outdoor air pollution may be emerging as an important risk factor for early-onset TBL cancer.<a id="xref-ref-36-1" href="#ref-36">36 37</a> In addition to tobacco, we identified two risk factors for early-onset TBL cancer: high fasting plasma glucose and a diet low in fruits. Recently, a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies demonstrated high glycaemic index diet increased risks of lung cancer.<a id="xref-ref-38-1" href="#ref-38">38</a> Therefore, it is necessary to implement a planned programme of measures, including preventing indoor and outdoor air pollution, promoting balanced diet and blood glucose control for diabetic, to further reduce the burden of early-onset TBL cancer.</p><p id="p-44">Early-onset CRC also had high DALYs for both sexes and was the most common form of digestive system early-onset cancer in 2019 globally, accounting for 36.8%. It was reported that greater proportions of patients younger than 50 years were diagnosed with advanced-stage tumours than older patients, thus promoting diagnosis of early-onset CRC patients and identification of potential risk factor were important to improving prevention and therapy of early-onset CRC.<a id="xref-ref-39-1" href="#ref-39">39</a> In 1990, Australasia had the highest occurrence of early-onset CRC. By 2019, this incidence had further increased. However, it is important to highlight that in East Asia, the ASIR of early-onset CRC rose from 4.2 per 100k in 1990 to 10.0 per 100k in 2019, making it the top-ranked region. Besides, the results of risk factors analysis indicated that a diet low in milk, low in whole grains and low in calcium were the top risk factors for early-onset CRC in both women and men. Although diet low in calcium were the top risk factors for early-onset CRC in 2019, its risk proportion showed a general downward trend from 1990 to 2019 across all SDI regions, which may benefit from calcium fortification programme since 1990.<a id="xref-ref-40-1" href="#ref-40">40</a> Interestingly, as one source of calcium intake, an obvious downward trend of risk proportion of diet low in milk of early-onset CRC from 1990 to 2019 was only observed in high SDI region, but an upward or flat trend in other SDI regions. For a diet low in whole grains, the risk proportion in high SDI region has been on an upward trend from 1990 to 2019. The above results suggest that calcium and milk fortification should be taken into reducing the risk of early-onset CRC in the population, especially in non-high SDI regions. Furthermore, diet in whole grains should be promoted, especially in high SDI regions. Except for dietary risk factors, alcohol use, high BMI, tobacco consumption, high fasting plasma glucose and low physical activity contributed to early-onset CRC. Of these risk factors, high BMI, particularly obesity, has been identified as a strong risk factor for early-onset CRC. The increasing prevalence of obesity in younger generations has led to a substantial increase in early-onset CRC cases.<a id="xref-ref-41-1" href="#ref-41">41</a> According to research, obesity is associated with an OR of 1.4 for early-onset CRC.<a id="xref-ref-42-1" href="#ref-42">42</a> Besides, individuals with high fasting plasma glucose and diabetes have a higher risk of developing early-onset CRC, as demonstrated by previous studies,<a id="xref-ref-43-1" href="#ref-43">43</a> and it was recommended to conduct CRC screening earlier for those with diabetes than for the general population.<a id="xref-ref-44-1" href="#ref-44">44</a> Taken together, in addition to focusing on traditional lifestyle risk factors, dietary modifications will have a positive impact on lowering the incidence burden of early-onset CRC.</p><p id="p-45">The ASIR of early-onset stomach cancer in 2019 was highest in East Asia, high-income Asia Pacific, and Eastern Europe, whereas Oceania had the highest ASDR. Generally, stomach non-cardia cancer was common in Eastern Asia and Eastern Europe where the prevalence of <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection is quite high.<a id="xref-ref-45-1" href="#ref-45">45</a> Overall, the morbidity and mortality of early-onset stomach cancer in the most regions showed a downward trend from 1990 to 2019, which suggests that the prevention and treatment of stomach cancer has achieved a remarkable success in recent decades. Undoubtedly, the decrease in mortality of early-onset stomach cancer mainly attributed to the control of risk factors, screening, and treatment methods. For instance, the prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> infection, associated with early-onset stomach cancer, has declined in the USA, most European countries and several East Asian countries.<a id="xref-ref-46-1" href="#ref-46">46</a> More importantly, surgical resection combined with neoadjuvant/perioperative chemotherapy is a highly effective treatment for stomach cancer in early stage, which gives a substantial support to the prevention and treatment of early stomach cancer. Additionally, our result indicated that tobacco and a diet high in sodium were the main risk factors for early-onset stomach cancer. Therefore, the morbidity of early-onset stomach cancer might benefit from the decrease in salt intake and tobacco control.</p><p id="p-46">As the SDI increased, there was a rise in the ASIR of early-onset cancer; yet in regions with a high SDI (&gt;0.7), there was a reduction in both early-onset cancer ASDR and DALYs rate as the SDI increased. The high of ASDR and DALYs rate concentrated on middle and middle-high SDI regions. Despite the fact that the ASIR remained elevated in high SDI regions, advancements in medical technology and treatments had substantially alleviated the mortality and overall impact of early-onset cancer. Conversely, it appeared that the middle SDI region was afflicted by the issue of early-onset cancer with high deaths and DALYs. Meanwhile, our findings indicated that the relationship between the HDI and the EAPC of incidence and death rates for early-onset breast cancer, TBL cancer, CRC and stomach cancer follows an inverted U-shaped curve, and the highest EAPC was observed in regions with low-middle and middle HDI, ranging from 0.5 to 0.7. Therefore, it could be concluded that in countries with a low-middle and middle HDI, burdensome early-onset cancers were displaying the most rapid increase in incidence, mortality and DALYs rates. As a result, enhancing the monitoring and prevention of early-onset cancers in these regions is crucial.</p><p id="p-47">Genetic screening has become an indispensable tool due to its emphasis on the prevention of early-stage cancer. For example, current research indicated that breast and ovarian cancer were associated with variants in the <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> genes.<a id="xref-ref-47-1" href="#ref-47">47</a> Besides, approximately 10% of CRC cases have been found to be associated with pathogenic variants according to research studies.<a id="xref-ref-20-5" href="#ref-20">20</a> Research studies have revealed that these pathogenic variants were detected in 15%–33% of individuals who were diagnosed with CRC before the age of 50, regardless of their family history of the disease.<a id="xref-ref-20-6" href="#ref-20">20</a> More importantly, next-generation sequencing has led to improvements in the accessibility and affordability of genetic testing for cancer susceptibility genes. Therefore, genetic screening is expected to have a significant impact on the identification and anticipation of early-onset cancers in the near future.</p><p id="p-48">However, the study still has several limitations due to GBD 2019’s intrinsic drawbacks. First, the accuracy of GBD data was compromised by the quality of cancer registry data in different countries. Thus, the under-reporting and under-diagnosis in undeveloped countries may result in underestimation of the incidences and deaths of early-onset cancer. Second, the increasing trend of early-onset cancer burden is still unclear, which may be related to early screening intervention and early-life exposures. Third, the estimation of risk factor exposure was conducted on data with sparse investigation time nodes and different sources, which may affect influence accuracy and introduce potential measurement bias. Fourth, it is inevitable that implementing a dichotomy at 50 years of age has drawbacks because pathological, molecular and biological characteristics are unlikely to change considerably at that age.</p></div><div id="sec-24"><h2>Conclusions</h2><p id="p-49">Our study showed that the global morbidity of early-onset cancer increased from 1990 to 2019, while mortality and DALYs slightly decreased. The rate of incidence, mortality and DALY varied widely across regions, countries and cancer types. The highest-burden regions and cancer types were high-middle and middle SDI regions and early-onset breast cancer, TBL cancer, CRC and stomach cancer, respectively. Dietary risk factors, alcohol use and tobacco consumption were the main risk factors for top early-onset cancers in 2019. Additionally, it is necessary to conduct prospective life-course cohort studies to explore the aetiologies of early-onset cancers. Encouraging a healthy lifestyle, including a healthy diet, the restriction of tobacco and alcohol consumption and appropriate outdoor activity, could reduce the burden of early-onset cancer. It is worth exploring whether early screening and prevention programmes for early-onset cancer should be expanded to include individuals aged 40–44 and 45–49, but further systematic studies and randomised trials are necessary to make a definitive determination.</p></div><div id="sec-25"><h2>Data availability statement</h2><p id="p-58">Data are available in a public, open access repository.
