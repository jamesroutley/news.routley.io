<p>A friend found some AirPods on the ground and tapped them to his phone, revealing only the serial number and the last four digits of the owner&#39;s number. He turned to me for help.</p>
<p>Could I really brute-force spam all phone numbers ending in 1234 and find the right owner? This seemed a bit impractical, so I had to think of ways to whittle the number down to something more manageable.</p>
<p>I started with the assumption that the owner lived near me in the Portland metropolitan area. With that, I restricted the search to our local area code*. Sure, they could be from out of town, but hey, let&#39;s give it a shot.</p>
<p>999 numbers is a manageable list, but I wanted to trim the number a bit more. Sure, sending a thousand SMS messages isn&#39;t much to a determined spammer, but I didn&#39;t want to be that noisy or piss off Twilio.</p>
<p>Possible matches: <em>999</em></p>
<p>Next, I narrowed it down by <a href="https://localcallingguide.com/lca_prefix.php">central office code (commonly called prefix)</a> (those three digits after the area code). Most of Portlandâ€™s are assigned, but only 26% to wireless carriers. Also, 000-199 are reserved codes that aren&#39;t available for telcos. I lied earlier, sorry.</p>
<p>Possible matches: <em>232</em></p>

<p>Next, I had to assume the owner had iMessage enabled, which seemed like a safe bet. I ran an iMessage check using <a href="https://loopmessage.com/lookup">an API</a>. (The API is probably used for shady stuff, but my intentions were pure.)</p>
<p>Total matches: <em>84</em></p>
<p>With the list whittled down, I avoided Twilio entirely by using <a href="https://github.com/rdyson/bulk-macos-messages">a script</a> on my MacBook to send iMessages in bulk. Now we wait.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Bingo! I found the owner, relayed the contact info to my friend, and the AirPods were returned to the right ears.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, <a href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/">Find My</a> exists, but they had no idea how to use it. Plus, where&#39;s the fun in that?</li>
<li>I did have to field a few messages from confused people, but I got really lucky and hit in less than 10 messages. We confirmed that the AirPods paired, which wouldn&#39;t be possible if they didn&#39;t belong to them.</li>
<li>*Portland has two area codes, but I only had to try one. Luck, right?</li>
</ul>
