    <h1>Old C code â€“ how to upgrade it?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I&#39;ve got this code I&#39;m interested in [1], and asked about 2 years ago, actually. My efforts at patching it didn&#39;t go well, in retrospect. [2]<p>It&#39;s a Forth variant that does typing, and lots of things that normal forth can&#39;t do... likely as powerful as Lisp, I think. It&#39;s become an obsession to get this thing running.</p><p>I do a wget, unzip, untar, ./configure, make, su make install and it works perfectly... under Debian 3</p><p>Anything newer, even with -std=c99, and it dies a horrible death.</p><p>Taking the executable from Debian 3 to Debian 11 (32 bit) and it works perfectly.</p><p>How do I, a non-C programmer, who is willing to dump tons of time into it, migrate this code into the year 2022?</p><p>Here&#39;s an example of something that seems opaque to me, from src/words.c:2012</p><pre><code>     *(--(char*)hash_ptr.parm.v.p) = fpop(sst);
</code></pre>
I have a hint as to what&#39;s going on here, but when you throw * in there twice, I think you can see how it&#39;s confusing.<p>1 - <a href="http://stoical.sourceforge.net/download.php" rel="nofollow">http://stoical.sourceforge.net/download.php</a></p><p>2 - <a href="https://github.com/mikewarot/stoical" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mikewarot/stoical</a></p></td></div></div>
