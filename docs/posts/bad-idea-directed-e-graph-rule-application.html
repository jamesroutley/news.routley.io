<h5>We teach our children that making friends is easy: you just walk up to any kid on the playground and say, “My name is [whatever], do you want to play?” And if you’re four or five years old, this works pretty well. But it’s a lot more complicated when you’re a grown-up.</h5>
<h5>The tips here are for starting a conversation with a stranger, but of course, they also apply to starting a conversation with someone you already know (which is considerably easier and less risky).</h5>
</div> <div>
<h5>You want to practice your role in advance so that when the time comes, you don’t have to take time to think about what you need to say, and can instead focus your attention on the other person’s reaction, so you know whether you are being encouraged to continue the interaction or being told to back off (see <a href="https://socialcommunication.truman.edu/attitudes-emotions/expressing-emotion/">expressing emotion).</a></h5>
<h5>There is always a (pretty good) chance that your attempts to strike up a conversation will be rejected. Don’t be discouraged – this happens to everybody – and try not to take it personally. Review in your mind whether you broke any of the “rules” described here, but remember that there are times, even if you do everything “right,” that these strategies just won’t work. The other person might have something on their mind, or just isn’t friendly, and that’s no reflection on you.</h5>

<div id="wp-spoiler-1" data-style="wpui-light">  <h3 data-showtext="click to show">Starting A Conversation With Someone You Don&#39;t Know: WHY??</h3><div><p> In several places in the U.S. (especially the big cities), it would be considered rude to initiate a conversation (or even say hello or make eye contact) with someone you don’t already know. In these places, the polite thing to do is to avoid imposing on people – and striking up a conversation <em>is</em> an imposition, as it requires them to either respond to you or to appear rude. In most smaller towns, however, it is considered polite and friendly to chat with someone wherever strangers might have to pass a few minutes together (in an elevator, in a check-out line, if you end up sitting next to each other waiting for a show or a game or some other event to begin, e.g.). If you think of yourself as a loner, someone who isn’t interested in making new friends, this may seem absurd and pointless to you. Even if you are interested in making new friends, most of the time when you strike up “small talk,” you’re talking to people you’ll never see again. So why bother?</p>
<p>There are times when you can’t avoid meeting new people: when you start a new job (or a new worker starts at your workplace), when you start a new class, when you meet new neighbors, when someone you already know introduces you to someone else, etc. It does matter what these people think of you, even if you don’t become close friends. If your co-workers or boss don’t like you, it will make your work more difficult. If your classmates or teacher don’t like you, it will make the classroom experience very difficult. If your friend’s friend thinks you’re a jerk, your friend will be embarrassed by you. For most people, then, small talk with strangers is a way to practice the skills they will need to make a good first impression on those whose opinions of you do matter.</p>
<p>You should be aware, however, that men are much more likely to interpret a woman striking up a conversation as an attempt to flirt than women are apt to do when the roles are reversed, so if you are a woman, you want to be especially careful about approaching an unknown man, especially if there aren’t other people around.</p>

<h2>Other Subtle Signals You May Be Missing</h2>
<p>Obviously, if someone greets you, you should greet them back. (This is common courtesy.) If someone makes a comment, whether a positive comment or a shared gripe, you should feel free to reciprocate with a comment of your own (agreement is always safe, if you can), but it is also perfectly polite to simply smile and/or nod. If you do not acknowledge the comment (at least non-verbally), you will appear unfriendly. But often people will send signals even before they speak to you, signs that it would be okay if you spoke to them<br/>
