    <h1>Satoshi – Sirius emails 2009-2011</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>This is the correspondence between myself (Martti Malmi, AKA Sirius) and Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin.

I did not feel comfortable sharing private correspondence earlier, but decided to do so for an important trial in the UK in 2024 where I was a witness. Also, a long time has passed now since the emails were sent.

The archive is incomplete and contains only emails from my address @cc.hut.fi. My university email addresses changed to @aalto.fi in early 2011, and I don&#39;t have backups of those emails.

There are some passwords and a street address mentioned in the emails, but those are no longer valid or relevant.

        <pre>Thanks for starting that topic on ASC, your understanding of bitcoin is 
spot on.  Some of their responses were rather Neanderthal, although I 
guess they&#39;re so used to being anti-fiat-money that anything short of 
gold isn&#39;t good enough.  They concede that something is flammable, but 
argue that it&#39;ll never burn because there&#39;ll never be a spark.  Once 
it&#39;s backed with cash, that might change, but I&#39;d probably better 
refrain from mentioning that in public anymore until we&#39;re closer to 
ready to start.  I think we&#39;ll get flooded with newbies and we need to 
get ready first.

What we need most right now is website writing.  My writing is not that 
great, I&#39;m a much better coder.  Maybe you could create the website on 
sourceforge, which is currently blank.  If you can write a FAQ, I can 
give you a compilation of my replies to questions in e-mail and forums 
for facts and details and ideas.

Codewise, there&#39;s not much that&#39;s easy right now.  One thing that&#39;s 
needed is an interface for server side scripting languages such as Java, 
Python, PHP, ASP, etc.  Bitcoin would be running on the web server, and 
server side script could call it to do transactions.  It&#39;s Windows, so I 
guess OLE/COM is the interface.

One easy thing that really helps is to run a node that can accept 
incoming connections (forward port 8333 on your firewall) to make sure 
that new users who try it out have someone to connect to.  If they run 
it and get no connections, they&#39;ll probably just give up.

        <pre>All right, I can do the website and the FAQ. I&#39;ll start writing the  
FAQ now with the questions that I can think of.

I have a feature suggestion for the program: a UI tool for creating  
password protected private keys and saving them into a custom  
location. Backups of the key will be needed to be safe from losing the  
control of your coins, and for using the coins on more than one  
computers. Password protection would be needed to make using your  
money more difficult for someone who happens to find your key file.

Maybe a bug/feature tracker could be set up at the Sourceforge project page?

I&#39;m running a bitcoin node always when my PC is powered on, which  
means about 24/7. Bitcoin is a great project, and it&#39;s really cool to  
participate!

That would be great!  I added you (dmp1ce) as a dev to the sourceforge 
project and gave you access to edit the web space and everything.

&gt; someone who happens to find your key file.

Definitely.  This will be an absolutely essential feature once things 
get going, making it so you can lock your wealth up with strong 
encryption and back it up more securely than any physical safe.  So far 
I&#39;ve been putting it off in favour of other features because it&#39;s not 
crucial yet until bitcoins start to have value.

I plan to work on the escrow feature next, which is needed to make 
actual trades for physical stuff safer and before backing the currency 
with fiat money can begin.


&gt; I&#39;m running a bitcoin node always when my PC is powered on, which means 
&gt; about 24/7. Bitcoin is a great project, and it&#39;s really cool to 
&gt; participate!

Thanks!  Right now there are a lot of people on the network who can&#39;t 
receive incoming connections, so every node that can really helps. 
Having more helps keep down the &#34;(not accepted)&#34; issue for now until I 
reduce the chances of that happening in v0.1.6.

I guess one answer for the FAQ should be how to set up your firewall to 
forward port 8333 so you can receive incoming connections.  The question 
could be something like &#34;what if I have 0 connections&#34; and that could be 
the answer that it might be because the nodes you can connect with is 
limited if you don&#39;t set that up.

Here&#39;s a compilation of questions I&#39;ve answered in forums and e-mail 
that should help you see what questions are frequently asked and some 
answers I&#39;ve used.  It&#39;s not intended to use all or most of the material 
here, just pick and choose.  This is just a dump of everything I&#39;ve 
answered.

Some issues that we don&#39;t have easy answers for are best not to bring 
up.  Casual users seems content to assume that the system works as 
stated (which it does), and getting into the design details just opens a 
can of worms that can&#39;t be answered without a deep understanding of the 
system.  The advanced questions I&#39;ve received have mostly been unique 
per person and best answered individually.



**** QUESTION AND ANSWER DUMP ****

Any questions used for the FAQ should probably be rephrased.

questions:

 &gt; The bottom of the UI shows:
 &gt;
 &gt; Generating        4 connections     4024 blocks     164 transactions
 &gt;
 &gt; I understand &#34;generating&#34;; I assume I am connected to 4 other nodes; and
 &gt; I know I have recorded 164 transactions (including failed generation
 &gt; attempts).  I&#39;m not clear what the &#34;blocks&#34; figure describes.  It&#39;s much
 &gt; smaller than the total of all the blocks shown against all my 
transactions.
 &gt;

It&#39;s the total number of blocks in the block chain, meaning the 
network&#39;s block chain, which everyone has a copy of.  Every Bitcoin node 
displays the same number and it goes up about every 10 minutes whenever 
someone generates a block.  When you haven&#39;t had it running for a while, 
once you&#39;re connected it spins up rapidly as it downloads what was 
generated while you were gone to catch up.  I&#39;m not sure exactly how to 
describe it (that would fit on the status bar in 1 word, maybe 2 words 
max), any ideas?

The blocks number in the status column next to your transactions is the 
number of blocks that have come after that transaction.  Your 
transaction is essentially &#34;in&#34; that many blocks.

Satoshi




 &gt; My best guess - it
 &gt; is the length of the global chain, and the rapid advance at the start
 &gt; is as the software downloads and verifies the preceding blocks in the
 &gt; chain as being valid.

Right.  I&#39;m trying to think of more clear wording for that, maybe &#34;%d 
network blocks&#34; or &#34;%d block chain&#34;.





 &gt; I&#39;m having an unusual run of (block not-accepted) failures, and 
thought I&#39;d let you know in
 &gt; case this was of any significance.

What rate of not-accepted did you see?  I didn&#39;t see anything unusual on 
my end.  If you had more than, say, 4 in a row, that would be abnormal 
and probably a loss of network communication.  If it&#39;s scattered and 
less than 25%, just random bad luck.  It&#39;s normal and harmless to 
randomly get some per cent of not-accepted, and of course randomness can 
sometimes bunch up and look like a pattern.

The idea of an option to View/Hide unaccepted blocks is a good one, as 
well as View/Hide all generated blocks so you can more easily see 
incoming transactions.  Seeing the unaccepted blocks is just annoying 
and frustrating.  Everyone faces the same rate of unaccepted, it&#39;s just 
a part of the process.  It would probably be best to default to hide 
unaccepted blocks, so as not to show giving and taking away something 
that never was, and not show new generated blocks at all until they have 
at least one confirmation.  It would only mean finding out you have a 
generated block 15 minutes later than normal, and then you still have 
119 blocks to go before it matures anyway.  This is on the to-do list 
for v0.1.6.

Satoshi

[note: I have some improvements in 0.1.6 to reduce this problem somewhat,
and it&#39;ll also improve when the network is larger]







 &gt; For some reason your transfer to me shows up as &#34;From: unknown&#34; even
 &gt; though I added you to my address book.
 &gt;
 &gt; I have a &#34;Generated (not accepted)&#34; line in my transaction list, it
 &gt; seems like an attempt to generate a coin went wrong somehow. Not sure
 &gt; what happened here - presumably my node successfully solved a block
 &gt; but then I went offline before it was sent to the network?

Transactions sent to a bitcoin address will always say &#34;from: unknown&#34;. 
  The transaction only tells who it&#39;s to.  Sending by bitcoin address 
has a number of problems, but it&#39;s so nice having the fallback option to 
be able to send to anyone whether they&#39;re online or not.  There are a 
number of ideas to try to improve things later.  For now, if things work 
out like the real world where the vast majority of transactions are with 
merchants, they&#39;ll pretty much always make sure to set up to receive by 
IP.  The P2P file sharing networks seem fairly successful at getting a 
large percentage of their users to set up their firewalls to forward a port.

I badly wanted to find some way to include a comment with indirect
transfers, but there just wasn&#39;t a way to do it.  Bitcoin uses EC-DSA, which
was essential for making the block chain compact enough to be practical with
today&#39;s technology because its signatures are an order of magnitude smaller
than RSA.  But EC-DSA can&#39;t encrypt messages like RSA, it can only be used
to verify signatures.

The &#34;Generated (not accepted)&#34; normally happens if two nodes find a 
block at close to the same time, one of them will not be accepted.  It&#39;s 
normal and unavoidable.  I plan in v0.1.6 to hide those, since they&#39;re 
just confusing and annoying and there&#39;s no reason for users to have to 
see them.  While the network is still small like it is now, if you can&#39;t 
receive incoming connections you&#39;re at more of a disadvantage because 
you can&#39;t receive block announcements as directly.




 &gt; ...So far it has two &#34;Generated&#34; messages, however the
 &gt; &#34;Credit&#34; field for those is 0.00 and the balance hasn&#39;t changed.  Is
 &gt; this due to the age/maturity requirement for a coin to be valid?

Right, the credit field stays 0.00 until it matures, then it&#39;ll be
50.00.  BTW, you can doubleclick on a line for details.





 &gt; ...understand correctly, there is only one (or maybe a few) global
 &gt; chain[s] into which all transactions are hashed. If there is only one
 &gt; chain recording &#34;the story of the economy&#34; so to speak, how does this
 &gt; scale? In an imaginary planet-wide deployment there would be millions
 &gt; of even billions of transactions per hour being hashed into the chain...

 &gt; ...I found the section on incentives hard to follow. In particular, I&#39;m
 &gt; not clear on what triggers the transition from minting new coins as a
 &gt; reason to run a node, to charging transaction fees (isn&#39;t the point of
 &gt; BitCoin largely to zero transaction costs anyway?). Presumably there&#39;s
 &gt; some human in charge of the system...

 &gt; ...How did you decide on the inflation schedule for v1? Where did 21
 &gt; million coins come from? What denominations are these coins? You
 &gt; mention a way to combine and split value but I&#39;m not clear on how this
 &gt; works. For instance are bitcoins always denominated by an integer or
 &gt; can you have fractional bitcoins?...

 &gt; ...it&#39;s rare that I encounter truly
 &gt; revolutionary ideas. The last time I was this excited about a new
 &gt; monetary scheme was when I discovered Ripple. If you have any thoughts
 &gt; on Ripple, I&#39;d also love to hear them.

There is only one global chain.

The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million 
Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much 
larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It 
never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you&#39;re interested, I can go over 
the ways it would cope with extreme size.

By Moore&#39;s Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 
years and 100 times faster in 10.  Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy 
adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of 
transactions.

I don&#39;t anticipate that fees will be needed anytime soon, but if it 
becomes too burdensome to run a node, it is possible to run a node that 
only processes transactions that include a transaction fee.  The owner 
of the node would decide the minimum fee they&#39;ll accept.  Right now, 
such a node would get nothing, because nobody includes a fee, but if 
enough nodes did that, then users would get faster acceptance if they 
include a fee, or slower if they don&#39;t.  The fee the market would settle 
on should be minimal.  If a node requires a higher fee, that node would 
be passing up all transactions with lower fees.  It could do more volume 
and probably make more money by processing as many paying transactions 
as it can.  The transition is not controlled by some human in charge of 
the system though, just individuals reacting on their own to market forces.

A key aspect of Bitcoin is that the security of the network grows as the 
size of the network and the amount of value that needs to be protected 
grows.  The down side is that it&#39;s vulnerable at the beginning when it&#39;s 
small, although the value that could be stolen should always be smaller 
than the amount of effort required to steal it.  If someone has other 
motives to prove a point, they&#39;ll just be proving a point I already concede.

My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an 
educated guess.  It was a difficult choice, because once the network is 
going it&#39;s locked in and we&#39;re stuck with it.  I wanted to pick 
something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but 
without knowing the future, that&#39;s very hard.  I ended up picking 
something in the middle.  If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it&#39;ll be 
worth less per unit than existing currencies.  If you imagine it being 
used for some fraction of world commerce, then there&#39;s only going to be 
21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per 
unit.  Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is 
represented internally as 100000000.  There&#39;s plenty of granularity if 
typical prices become small.  For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, 
then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, 
so if you had 1 Bitcoin it&#39;s now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is 
displayed as 1.

Ripple is interesting in that it&#39;s the only other system that does 
something with trust besides concentrate it into a central server.

Satoshi






 &gt; If we assume that 0.1% is a good risk rate, then z=5 thus
 &gt; any transaction must wait a bit less than an hour before being
 &gt; solidified in the chain. As micropayments for things like web content
 &gt; or virtual goods are by definition something that requires low
 &gt; overhead, waiting an hour seems like quite a significant hurdle.

For the actual risk, multiply the 0.1% by the probability that the buyer 
is an attacker with a huge network of computers.

For micropayments, you can safely accept the payment immediately.  The 
size of the payment is too small for the effort to steal it. 
Micropayments are almost always for intellectual property, where there&#39;s 
no physical loss to the merchant.  Anyone trying to steal a micropayment 
would probably not be a paying customer anyway, and if they want to 
steal intellectual property they can use the file sharing networks.

Currently, businesses accept a certain chargeoff rate.  I believe the 
risk with 1 or even 0 confirming blocks will be much less than the rate 
of chargebacks on verified credit card transactions.

The usual scam against a merchant that doesn&#39;t wait for confirming 
blocks would be to send a payment to a merchant, then quickly try to 
propagate a double-spend to the network before the merchant&#39;s copy. What 
the merchant can do is broadcast his transaction and then monitor the 
network for any double-spend copies.  The thief would not be able to 
broadcast during the monitoring period or else the merchant&#39;s node would 
receive a copy.  The merchant would only have to monitor for a minute or 
two until most of the network nodes have his version and it&#39;s too late 
for the thief&#39;s version to catch up and reach many nodes.  With just a 
minute or two delay, the chance of getting away without paying could be 
made much too low to scam.  A thief usually needs a high probability of 
getting an item for free to make it worthwhile.  Using a lot of CPU 
power to do the brute force attack discussed in the paper in addition to 
the above scam would not increase the thief&#39;s chances very much.

Anything that grants access to something, like something that takes a 
while to download, access to a website, web hosting, a subscription or 
service, can be cancelled a few minutes later if the transaction is 
rejected.


 &gt; How is the required difficulty of each block communicated through the
 &gt; network and agreed upon?

It&#39;s not communicated.  The formula is hardcoded in the program and 
every node does the same calculation to know what difficulty is required 
for the next block.  If someone diverged from the formula, their block 
would not be accepted by the majority.





 &gt; Is the code free/open source or just open source?

It&#39;s free open source.  It&#39;s the MIT license, which just requires some 
disclaimer text be kept with the source code, other than that you can do 
just about anything you want with it.  The source is included in the 
main download.

 &gt; Is there a way to be told of new versions? Does the app auto update
 &gt; itself?  Some kind of mailing list would be excellent.

The list is:
bitcoin-list@lists.sourceforge.net
Subscribe/unsubscribe page:

I&#39;ll always announce new versions there.  Automatic update, or at least 
notification of new versions, is definitely on the list.





[this inflation discussion was before the transaction fee mechanism and 
fixed plan of 21 million coins was posted, so it may not be as 
applicable anymore]

 &gt; Since they can be created for free (or at the cost
 &gt; of computer power people have anyway for other reasons),
 &gt; monetizing them means simply giving away money.

You&#39;re still thinking as if the difficulty level will be so easy that 
people will be able to generate all the bitcoins they want.

Imagine you have to run your computer 24/7 for a month to generate 1 
cent.  After a year, you could generate 12 cents.  That&#39;s not going to 
make it so people can just generate all the bitcoin they want for spending.

The value of bitcoins would be relative to the electricity consumed to 
produce them.  All modern CPUs save power when they&#39;re idle.  If you run 
a computational task 24/7, not letting it idle, it uses significantly 
more power, and you&#39;ll notice it generates more heat.  The extra wattage 
consumed goes straight to your power bill, and the value of the bitcoins 
you produce would be something less than that.


 &gt; Why would they, when they make money by generating
 &gt; new ones

No, they can&#39;t make money that way.  It would cost them more in 
electricity than they&#39;d be selling the bitcoins for.






Historically, people have taken up scarce commodities as money, if 
necessary taking up whatever is at hand, such as shells or stones.  Each 
has a kernel of usefulness that helped bootstrap the process, but the 
monetary value ends up being much more than the functional value alone. 
  Most of the value comes from the value that others place in it.  Gold, 
for instance, is pretty, non-corrosive and easily malleable, but most of 
its value is clearly not from that.  Brass is shiny and similar in 
colour.  The vast majority of gold sits unused in vaults, owned by 
governments that could care less about its prettiness.

Until now, no scarce commodity that can be traded over a communications 
channel without a trusted third party has been available.  If there is a 
desire to take up a form of money that can be traded over the Internet 
without a TTP, then now that is possible.

 &gt; As more capable
 &gt; computer hardware comes out, the natural supply per user
 &gt; doubles at every cycle of Moore&#39;s law.

Actually, that is handled.  There&#39;s a moving average that compensates 
for the total effort being expended so that the total production is a 
constant.  As computers get more powerful, the difficulty increases to 
compensate.


 &gt; I do not recall any economic history of a commodity subject
 &gt; to natural inflation ever being used as money

There&#39;s gold for one.  The supply of gold increases by about 2%-3% per 
year.  Any fiat currency typically averages more inflation than that.



 &gt; Won&#39;t there be massive inflation as computers get faster and are able 
to solve the proof-of-work problem faster?

The difficulty is controlled by a moving average that compensates for 
the total effort being expended to keep the total production constant. 
As computers get more powerful, the difficulty increases to compensate.






 &gt; If someone double spends, then the transaction record
 &gt; can be unblinded revealing the identity of the cheater?

Identities are not used, and there&#39;s no reliance on recourse.  It&#39;s all 
prevention.





 &gt; ...You&#39;re saying
 &gt; there&#39;s no effort to identify and exclude nodes that don&#39;t
 &gt; cooperate? I suspect this will lead to trouble and possible DOS
 &gt; attacks.

There is no reliance on identifying anyone.  As you&#39;ve said, it&#39;s
futile and can be trivially defeated with sock puppets.

The credential that establishes someone as real is the ability to
supply CPU power.






 &gt; But in the absence of identity, there&#39;s no downside to them
 &gt; if spends become invalid, if they&#39;ve already received the
 &gt; goods they double-spent for (access to website, download,
 &gt; whatever). The merchants are left holding the bag with
 &gt; &#34;invalid&#34; coins, unless they wait that magical &#34;few blocks&#34;
 &gt; (and how can they know how many?) before treating the spender
 &gt; as having paid.
 &gt;
 &gt; The consumers won&#39;t do this if they spend their coin and it takes
 &gt; an hour to clear before they can do what they spent their coin on.
 &gt; The merchants won&#39;t do it if there&#39;s no way to charge back a
 &gt; customer when they find the that their coin is invalid because
 &gt; the customer has doublespent.

This is a version 2 problem that I believe can be solved fairly
satisfactorily for most applications.

The race is to spread your transaction on the network first.  Think 6
degrees of freedom -- it spreads exponentially.  It would only take
something like 2 minutes for a transaction to spread widely enough
that a competitor starting late would have little chance of grabbing
very many nodes before the first one is overtaking the whole network.
During those 2 minutes, the merchant&#39;s nodes can be watching for a
double-spent transaction.  The double-spender would not be able to
blast his alternate transaction out to the world without the merchant
getting it, so he has to wait before starting.

If the real transaction reaches 90% and the double-spent tx reaches
10%, the double-spender only gets a 10% chance of not paying, and 90%
chance his money gets spent.  For almost any type of goods, that&#39;s
not going to be worth it for the scammer.

Information based goods like access to website or downloads are
non-fencible.  Nobody is going to be able to make a living off
stealing access to websites or downloads.  They can go to the file
sharing networks to steal that.  Most instant-access products aren&#39;t
going to have a huge incentive to steal.

If a merchant actually has a problem with theft, they can make the
customer wait 2 minutes, or wait for something in e-mail, which many
already do.  If they really want to optimize, and it&#39;s a large
download, they could cancel the download in the middle if the
transaction comes back double-spent.  If it&#39;s website access,
typically it wouldn&#39;t be a big deal to let the customer have access
for 5 minutes and then cut off access if it&#39;s rejected.  Many such
sites have a free trial anyway.

[in response to a question about scale]

100,000 block generating nodes is a good ballpark large-scale size
to think about.  Propagating a transaction across the whole network
twice would consume a total of US$ 0.02 of bandwidth at today&#39;s
prices.  In practice, many would be burning off excess allocated
bandwidth or unlimited plans with one of the cheaper backbones.
There could be millions of SPV clients.  They only matter in how
many transactions they generate.  If they pay 1 or 2 cents
transaction fees, they pay for themselves.  I&#39;ve coded it so you
can pay any optional amount of transaction fees you want.  When the
incentive subsidy eventually tapers off, it may be necessary to put
a market-determined transaction fee on your transactions to make
sure nodes process them promptly.

To think about what a really huge transaction load would look like,
I look at the existing credit card network.  I found some more
estimates about how many transactions are online purchases.  It&#39;s
about 15 million tx per day for the entire e-commerce load of the
Internet worldwide.  At 1KB per transaction, that would be 15GB of
bandwidth for each block generating node per day, or about two DVD
movies worth.  Seems do-able even with today&#39;s technology.

Important to remember, even if Bitcoin caught on at dot-com rates
of growth, it would still take years to become any substantial
fraction of all transactions.  I believe hardware has already
recently become strong enough to handle large scale, but if there&#39;s
any doubt about that, bandwidth speeds, prices, disk space and
computing power will be much greater by the time it&#39;s needed.

Satoshi






 &gt; One other question I had... What prevents the single node with the most
 &gt; CPU power from generating and retaining the majority of the BitCoins?
 &gt; If every node is working independently of all others, if one is
 &gt; significantly more powerful than the others, isn&#39;t it probable that this
 &gt; node will reach the proper conclusion before other nodes? An
 &gt; underpowered node may get lucky once in a while, but if they are at a
 &gt; significant horsepower advantage I would expect the majority of BitCoins
 &gt; to be generated by the most powerful node.

It&#39;s not like a race where if one car is twice as fast, it&#39;ll always
win.  It&#39;s an SHA-256 that takes less than a microsecond, and each guess
has an independent chance of success.  Each computer&#39;s chance of finding
a hash collision is linearly proportional to it&#39;s CPU power.  A computer
that&#39;s half as fast would get half as many coins.






[question about what to backup]

The files are in &#34;%appdata%\Bitcoin&#34;, that&#39;s the directory to
backup.

%appdata% is per-user access privilege.  Most new programs like
Firefox store their settings files there, despite the headwind of
Microsoft changing the directory name with every Windows release
and being full of spaces and so long it runs off the screen.





[question about what to backup]

The directory is &#34;%appdata%\Bitcoin&#34;
It has spaces in it so you need the quotes
cd &#34;%appdata%\bitcoin&#34;

On XP it would typically be:
C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Bitcoin

Backup that whole directory.  All data files are in that
directory.  There are no temporary files.





[question about what to backup]

The crucial file to backup is wallet.dat.  If bitcoin is running
then you have to backup the whole %appdata%\bitcoin directory
including the database subdirectory, but even if it&#39;s not running
it certainly feels safer to always backup the whole directory.

The database unfortunately names its files &#34;log.0000000001&#34;.  To
the rest of the world, &#34;log&#34; means delete-at-will, but to database
people it means delete-and-lose-everything-in-your-other-files.  I
tried to put them out of harm&#39;s way by putting them in the
database subdirectory.  Later I&#39;ll write code to flush the logs
after every wallet change so wallet.dat will be standalone safe
almost all the time.







 &gt; &gt; You know, I think there were a lot more people interested in the 90&#39;s,
 &gt; &gt; but after more than a decade of failed Trusted Third Party based 
systems
 &gt; &gt; (Digicash, etc), they see it as a lost cause. I hope they can make the
 &gt; &gt; distinction that this is the first time I know of that we&#39;re trying a
 &gt; &gt; non-trust-based system.
 &gt;
 &gt; Yea, that was the primary feature that caught my eye. The real trick
 &gt; will be to get people to actually value the Bitcoins so that they become
 &gt; currency.

Hal sort of alluded to the possibility that it could be seen as a
long-odds investment.  I would be surprised if 10 years from now
we&#39;re not using electronic currency in some way, now that we know
a way to do it that won&#39;t inevitably get dumbed down when the
trusted third party gets cold feet.

Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you
could effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping
coins in a vending machine.

[this next bit turned out to be very controversial.  there is extreme
prejudice against spam solutions, especially proof-of-work.]

It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail.  The send dialog is
resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It&#39;s sent directly when it connects.  The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message.  If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website.  &#34;Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I&#39;ll read the message personally.&#34;

Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their
free trial so it doesn&#39;t cannibalize subscriptions could charge
bitcoins for the trial.




[again, I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m including this, as it&#39;s best to stay
away from claims about spam.  people automatically react violently
against any suggestion of a spam solution.]

 &gt; Spammer botnets could burn through pay-per-send email filters
 &gt; trivially (as usual, the costs would fall on people other than the
 &gt; botnet herders &amp; spammers).

Then you could earn a nice profit by setting up pay-per-send
e-mail addresses and collecting all the spam money.  You could
sell it back to spammers who don&#39;t have big enough botnets to
generate their own, helping bootstrap the currency&#39;s value.  As
more people catch on, they&#39;ll set up more and more phony addresses
to harvest it.  By the time the book &#34;How I got rich exploiting
spammers and you can too&#34; is coming out, there&#39;ll be too many fake
addresses and the spammers will have to give up.




 &gt; &gt; * Spammer botnets could burn through pay-per-send email filters
 &gt; &gt;   trivially
 &gt; If POW tokens do become useful, and especially if they become money,
 &gt; machines will no longer sit idle. Users will expect their computers to
 &gt; be earning them money (assuming the reward is greater than the cost to
 &gt; operate). A computer whose earnings are being stolen by a botnet will
 &gt; be more noticeable to its owner than is the case today, hence we might
 &gt; expect that in that world, users will work harder to maintain their
 &gt; computers and clean them of botnet infestations.

One more factor that would mitigate spam if POW tokens have value:
there would be a profit motive for people to set up massive
quantities of fake e-mail accounts to harvest POW tokens from
spam.  They&#39;d essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with
automated mailboxes that collect their POW and don&#39;t read the
message.  The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become
too high for spam to be cost effective.

The process has the potential to establish the POW token&#39;s value
in the first place, since spammers that don&#39;t have a botnet could
buy tokens from harvesters.  While the buying back would
temporarily let more spam through, it would only hasten the
self-defeating cycle leading to too many harvesters exploiting the
spammers.

Interestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of
spam called &#34;dusting&#34;.  Spammers send a tiny amount of gold dust
in order to put a spam message in the transaction&#39;s comment field.
  If the system let users configure the minimum payment they&#39;re
willing to receive, or at least the minimum that can have a
message with it, users could set how much they&#39;re willing to get
paid to receive spam.





 &gt; The last thing we need is to deploy a system designed to burn all
 &gt; available cycles, consuming electricity and generating carbon dioxide,
 &gt; all over the Internet, in order to produce small amounts of bitbux to
 &gt; get emails or spams through.
 &gt;
 &gt; Can&#39;t we just convert actual money in a bank account into bitbux --
 &gt; cheaply and without a carbon tax?  Please?

Ironic if we end up having to choose between economic liberty and
conservation.

Unfortunately, proof of work is the only solution I&#39;ve found to
make p2p e-cash work without a trusted third party.  Even if I
wasn&#39;t using it secondarily as a way to allocate the initial
distribution of currency, PoW is fundamental to coordinating the
network and preventing double-spending.

If it did grow to consume significant energy, I think it would
still be less wasteful than the labour and resource intensive
conventional banking activity it would replace.  The cost would be
an order of magnitude less than the billions in banking fees that
pay for all those brick and mortar buildings, skyscrapers and junk
mail credit card offers.

Satoshi






 &gt; BTW I don&#39;t remember if we talked about this, but the other day some
 &gt; people were mentioning secure timestamping. You want to be able to
 &gt; prove that a certain document existed at a certain time in the past.
 &gt; Seems to me that bitcoin&#39;s stack of blocks would be perfect for this.

Indeed, Bitcoin is a distributed secure timestamp server for
transactions.  A few lines of code could create a transaction with
an extra hash in it of anything that needs to be timestamped.
I should add a command to timestamp a file that way.






 From a thread on p2presearch which starts with my rant about trust 
being the root weakness of all conventional financial systems.
http://listcultures.org/pipermail/p2presearch_listcultures.org/2009-February/thread.html

I&#39;ve developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin.  It&#39;s
completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties,
because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust.  Give it a
try, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper:

Download Bitcoin v0.1 at http://www.bitcoin.org

The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that&#39;s
required to make it work.  The central bank must be trusted not to
debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of
breaches of that trust.  Banks must be trusted to hold our money and
transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit
bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.  We have to trust them with
our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.
Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.

A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar
problem.  Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password
protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system
administrator to keep their information private.  Privacy could always
be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the
principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his
superiors.  Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and
trust was no longer required.  Data could be secured in a way that was
physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason,
no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.

It&#39;s time we had the same thing for money.  With e-currency based on
cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman,
money can be secure and transactions effortless.

One of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital
signatures.  A digital coin contains the public key of its owner.  To
transfer it, the owner signs the coin together with the public key of
the next owner.  Anyone can check the signatures to verify the chain of
ownership.  It works well to secure ownership, but leaves one big
problem unsolved: double-spending.  Any owner could try to re-spend an
already spent coin by signing it again to another owner.  The usual
solution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for
double-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model.  In its
central position, the company can override the users, and the fees
needed to support the company make micropayments impractical.

Bitcoin&#39;s solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for
double-spending.  In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed
timestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin.  It
takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but
hard to stifle.  For details on how it works, see the design paper at
http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

The result is a distributed system with no single point of failure.
Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with
each other, with the help of the P2P network to check for double-spending.

Very interesting. Is this akin to David Chaum&#39;s anonymous digital
money? His concept makes sure money is anonymous unless it is
compromised, i.e. the same money spent more than once. As soon as it&#39;s
compromised, the ‘counterfeiter’ is immediately publicly exposed.

Also, in bitcoin, is there a limited supply of money (that must be
managed)? Or is money created exaclty at the moment of transaction?

Succes en plezier,

It&#39;s similar in that it uses digital signatures for coins, but different
in the approach to privacy and preventing double-spending.  The
recipient of a Bitcoin payment is able to check whether it is the first
spend or not, and second-spends are not accepted.  There isn&#39;t an
off-line mode where double-spenders are caught and shamed after the
fact, because that would require participants to have identities.

To protect privacy, key pairs are used only once, with a new one for
every transaction.  The owner of a coin is just whoever has its private key.

Of course, the biggest difference is the lack of a central server.  That
was the Achilles heel of Chaumian systems; when the central company shut
down, so did the currency.

 &gt; Also, in bitcoin, is there a limited supply of money (that must be
 &gt; managed)? Or is money created exaclty at the moment of transaction?

There is a limited supply of money.  Circulation will be 21,000,000
coins.  Transactions only transfer ownership.

Thank you for your questions,

Indeed, it is much like Pekunio in the concept of spraying redundant
copies of every transaction to a number of peers on the network, but the
implementation is not a reputation network like Wizard Rabbit Treasurer.
   In fact, Bitcoin does not use reputation at all.  It sees the network
as just a big crowd and doesn&#39;t much care who it talks to or who tells
it something, as long as at least one of them relays the information
being broadcast around the network.  It doesn&#39;t care because there&#39;s no
way to lie to it.  Either you tell it crypto proof of something, or it
ignores you.

As trust systems go, Ripple is unique in spreading trust around rather
than concentrating it.

Thanks for your answered questions, I&#39;ll add them to the faq. Here&#39;s

**** Bitcoin FAQ ****

General Questions

1 What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network based anonymous digital
currency. Peer-to-peer (P2P) means that there is no central
authority to issue new money or to keep track of the
transactions. Instead, those tasks are managed collectively by
the nodes of the network. Anonymity means that the real world
identity of the parties of a transaction can be kept hidden from
the public or even from the parties themselves.

2 How does bitcoin work?

Bitcoin utilizes public/private key cryptography. When a coin is
transfered from user A to user B, A adds B&#39;s public key to the
coin and signs it with his own private key. Now B owns the coin
and can transfer it further. To prevent A from transfering the
already used coin to another user C, a public list of all the
previous transactions is collectively maintained by the network
of bitcoin nodes, and before each transaction the coin&#39;s
unusedness will be checked.

For details, see chapter Advanced Questions.

3 What is bitcoin&#39;s value backed by?

Bitcoin is valued for the things it can be exchanged to, just
like all the traditional paper currencies are.

When the first user publicly announces that he will make a pizza
for anyone who gives him a hundred bitcoins, then he can use
bitcoins as payment to some extent - as much as people want pizza
and trust his announcement. A pizza-eating hairdresser who trusts
him as a friend might then announce that she starts accepting
bitcoins as payment for fancy haircuts, and the value of the
bitcoin would be higher - now you could buy pizzas and haircuts
with them. When bitcoins have become accepted widely enough, he
could retire from his pizza business and still be able to use his
bitcoin-savings.

4 How are new bitcoins created?

New coins are generated by a network node each time it finds the
solution to a certain calculational problem. In the first 4 years
of the bitcoin network, amount X of coins will be created. The
amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be X/2 after 4 years,
X/4 after 8 years and so on. Thus the total number of coins will
approach 2X.

5 Is bitcoin safe?

Yes, as long as you make backups of your coin keys, protect them
with strong passwords and keep keyloggers away from your
computer. If you lose your key or if some unknown attacker
manages to unlock it, there&#39;s no way to get your coins back. If
you have a large amount of coins, it is recommended to distribute
them under several keys. You propably wouldn&#39;t either keep all
your dollars or euros as paper in a single wallet and leave it
unguarded.

6 Why should I use bitcoin?

• Transfer money easily through the internet, without having to
   trust third parties.

• Third parties can&#39;t prevent or control your transactions.

• Be safe from the unfair monetary policies of the monopolistic
   central banks and the other risks of centralized power over a
   money supply. The limited inflation of the bitcoin system&#39;s
   money supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) throughout
   the network, not monopolized to a banking elite.

• Bitcoin&#39;s value is likely to increase as the growth of the
   bitcoin economy exceeds the inflation rate - consider bitcoin
   an investment and start running a node today!

7 Where can I get bitcoins?

Find a bitcoin owner and sell her something - MMORPG equipement,
IT support, lawn mowing, dollars or whatever you can trade with
her. You can also generate new bitcoins for yourself by running a
bitcoin network node.

        <pre>Oh crap, I got your sourceforge usernames mixed up, sorry about that.  I 
clicked on the wrong e-mail when I was looking for your username.  You 
now have access.

Your FAQ looks good so far!

You can create whatever you want on bitcoin.sourceforge.net.  Something 
to get new users up to speed on what Bitcoin is and how to use it and 
why, and clean and professional looking would help make it look well 
established.  The site at bitcoin.org was designed in a more 
professorial style when I was presenting the design paper on the 
Cryptography list, but we&#39;re moving on from that phase.

You should probably change the part about &#34;distribute them under several 
keys&#34;.  When the paper says that it means for the software to do it, and 
it does.  For privacy reasons, the software already uses a different key 
for every transaction, so every piece of money in your wallet is already 
on a different key.  The exception is when using a bitcoin address, 
everything sent to the same bitcoin address is on the same key, which is 
a privacy risk if you&#39;re trying to be anonymous.  The EC-DSA key size is 
very strong (sized for the future), we don&#39;t practically have to worry 
about a key getting broken, but if we did there&#39;s the advantage that 
someone expending the massive computing resources would only break one 
single transaction&#39;s worth of money, not someone&#39;s whole account.  The 
details about how to backup your wallet files is in the Q&amp;A dump and 
also it&#39;s explained in readme.txt and definitely belongs in the FAQ.

Oh I see, you&#39;re trying to address byronm&#39;s concern on freedomainradio. 
  I see what you mean about the password feature being useful to address 
that argument.  Banks let anyone who has your name and account number 
drain your account, and you&#39;re not going to get it back from Nigeria. 
If someone installs a keylogger on your computer, they could just as 
easily get your bank password and transfer money out of your account. 
Once we password encrypt the wallet, we&#39;ll be able to make a clearer 
case that we&#39;re much more secure than banks.  We use strong encryption, 
while banks still let anyone who has your account info draw money from 
your account.

&gt; could retire from his pizza business and still be able to use his
&gt; bitcoin-savings.
&gt; 
&gt; 4 How are new bitcoins created?
&gt; 
&gt; New coins are generated by a network node each time it finds the
&gt; solution to a certain calculational problem. In the first 4 years
&gt; of the bitcoin network, amount X of coins will be created. The
&gt; amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be X/2 after 4 years,
&gt; X/4 after 8 years and so on. Thus the total number of coins will
&gt; approach 2X.
&gt; 
&gt; 5 Is bitcoin safe?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, as long as you make backups of your coin keys, protect them
&gt; with strong passwords and keep keyloggers away from your
&gt; computer. If you lose your key or if some unknown attacker
&gt; manages to unlock it, there&#39;s no way to get your coins back. If
&gt; you have a large amount of coins, it is recommended to distribute
&gt; them under several keys. You propably wouldn&#39;t either keep all
&gt; your dollars or euros as paper in a single wallet and leave it
&gt; unguarded.
&gt; 
&gt; 6 Why should I use bitcoin?
&gt; 
&gt; • Transfer money easily through the internet, without having to
&gt;   trust third parties.
&gt; 
&gt; • Third parties can&#39;t prevent or control your transactions.
&gt; 
&gt; • Be safe from the unfair monetary policies of the monopolistic
&gt;   central banks and the other risks of centralized power over a
&gt;   money supply. The limited inflation of the bitcoin system&#39;s
&gt;   money supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) throughout
&gt;   the network, not monopolized to a banking elite.
&gt; 
&gt; • Bitcoin&#39;s value is likely to increase as the growth of the
&gt;   bitcoin economy exceeds the inflation rate - consider bitcoin
&gt;   an investment and start running a node today!
&gt; 
&gt; 7 Where can I get bitcoins?
&gt; 
&gt; Find a bitcoin owner and sell her something - MMORPG equipement,
&gt; IT support, lawn mowing, dollars or whatever you can trade with
&gt; her. You can also generate new bitcoins for yourself by running a
&gt; bitcoin network node.

&gt; You can create whatever you want on bitcoin.sourceforge.net.  Something
&gt; to get new users up to speed on what Bitcoin is and how to use it and
&gt; why, and clean and professional looking would help make it look well
&gt; established.  The site at bitcoin.org was designed in a more
&gt; professorial style when I was presenting the design paper on the
&gt; Cryptography list, but we&#39;re moving on from that phase.

Ok. Could you set the project MySQL database passwords so that I can  
set up a CMS on the site? I was thinking about WordPress, as it seems  
simple and well maintained. I need a password for the read/write  
account and one database (or the database admin pass to create it  
myself). This can be done somewhere in the project admin pages, I think.

&gt; You should probably change the part about &#34;distribute them under
&gt; several keys&#34;.  When the paper says that it means for the software to
&gt; do it, and it does.  For privacy reasons, the software already uses a
&gt; different key for every transaction, so every piece of money in your
&gt; wallet is already on a different key.  The exception is when using a
&gt; bitcoin address, everything sent to the same bitcoin address is on the
&gt; same key, which is a privacy risk if you&#39;re trying to be anonymous.
&gt; The EC-DSA key size is very strong (sized for the future), we don&#39;t
&gt; practically have to worry about a key getting broken, but if we did
&gt; there&#39;s the advantage that someone expending the massive computing
&gt; resources would only break one single transaction&#39;s worth of money, not
&gt; someone&#39;s whole account.  The details about how to backup your wallet
&gt; files is in the Q&amp;A dump and also it&#39;s explained in readme.txt and
&gt; definitely belongs in the FAQ.

Ok, that&#39;s good to know.

&gt; Oh I see, you&#39;re trying to address byronm&#39;s concern on freedomainradio.
&gt;  I see what you mean about the password feature being useful to address
&gt; that argument.  Banks let anyone who has your name and account number
&gt; drain your account, and you&#39;re not going to get it back from Nigeria.
&gt; If someone installs a keylogger on your computer, they could just as
&gt; easily get your bank password and transfer money out of your account.
&gt; Once we password encrypt the wallet, we&#39;ll be able to make a clearer
&gt; case that we&#39;re much more secure than banks.  We use strong encryption,
&gt; while banks still let anyone who has your account info draw money from
&gt; your account.

Well, I guess that&#39;s true after all.

They have Wordpress built in, you might not need to set up any database 
stuff manually.  I enabled the Wordpress feature and added you as an 
admin, account sirius-m, e-mail sirius-m@users.sourceforge.net.  I&#39;m not 
sure how it works out the password for access, maybe it&#39;s just based on 
being logged in to sourceforge.

https://apps.sourceforge.net/wordpress/bitcoin/wp-admin/

They also have support for MediaWiki if you want it.

In case you still need it, here&#39;s the accounts and passwords for mysql.

That&#39;s true.

We shouldn&#39;t try to use security against identity theft as a selling 
point, since it leads into these counter arguments.  The current banking 
model is already tested and the actual loss percentage is known.  Even 
if ours is probably better, it&#39;s an unknown, so people can imagine 
anything.  The uncertainty about what the average loss percentage will 
be is greater than the likely loss percentage itself.

The user group privileges seemingly can&#39;t be changed without changing  
the wiki source files, which can only be done by the SF admins as a  
hosted app is concerned. The hosted apps are also otherwise quite  
inflexible: you can only login with a SF account, you can&#39;t change  
themes by yourself and of course there&#39;s the ad-bar above the pages.

I think that replacing the current Wordpress installation at  
bitcoin.sourceforge.net with TikiWiki could be a great solution.  
TikiWiki supports CMS features, forums, wikis, bug trackers, and many  
other features also if needed. Perhaps the best looking example of a  
TikiWiki installation is at http://support.mozilla.com/.

I&#39;ll take backup of the current site and see if TikiWiki can be  
installed at SF. If it doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;ll see how wiki/forum features  
can be integrated with Wordpress or think of something else.

There are a lot of things you can say on the sourceforge site that I

numbered.  Also, could you delete the last sentence on the FAQ &#34;They are 
planned to be hidden in v0.1.6, since they&#39;re just confusing and 
annoying and there&#39;s no reason for users to have to see them.&#34; -- that&#39;s 
not really something I meant to say publicly.

The links to sites to help set up 8333 port forwarding is great. 
favicon is a nice touch.

Someone came up with the word &#34;cryptocurrency&#34;... maybe it&#39;s a word we 
should use when describing Bitcoin, do you like it?

Sourceforge is so slow right now I can&#39;t even get the login page to 
load.  Maybe due to the site reorg they just did.  I&#39;ll keep trying and 
try to get you that logo stats thing.

It sounds good. &#34;The P2P Cryptocurrency&#34; could be considered as the  
slogan, even if it&#39;s a bit more difficult to say than &#34;The Digital P2P

Thanks, I&#39;ve been really busy lately.

I registered username &#34;satoshi&#34;.  Since there&#39;s no SSL login, I want to 
mainly use that account with sub-admin powers and use the admin account 
as little as possible.  I created a &#34;Moderators&#34; group to give my 
satoshi account as much editing control as possible without the ability 
to overthrow everything.

There&#39;s something weird with the download bar on the right covering

        <pre>Hi,

I made a post on the Bitcoin developer&#39;s forum at SF about a month ago  
and sent you, David and Hal a notification about it to your  
users.sourceforge.net emails. A few days ago I wondered why no one had  
replied, and tried if the SF mail aliases even work - and they didn&#39;t,  
at least in the case of my account. So could you please forward this  
message to the others?

Best regards,

Hal isn&#39;t currently actively involved.  He helped me a lot defending the 
design on the Cryptography list, and with initial testing when it was 
first released.  He carried this torch years ago with his Reusable Proof 
Of Work (RPOW).

I&#39;m not going to be much help right now either, pretty busy with work, 
and need a break from it after 18 months development.

It would help if there was something for people to use it for.  We need 
an application to bootstrap it.  Any ideas?

There are donors I can tap if we come up with something that needs 
funding, but they want to be anonymous, which makes it hard to actually 
do anything with it.

That&#39;s strange, I haven&#39;t had any problems with that. Clearly the
banking establishment got scared and banned your account (and founded
www.bitcoin.com in attempt to fetch the trademark), eh. You could ask
if the SF staff at sfnet_ops@corp.sourceforge.com can help you.

Oh, that sounds tough. Take your time.

&gt; It would help if there was something for people to use it for.  We need
&gt; an application to bootstrap it.  Any ideas?

I&#39;ve been thinking about a currency exchange service that sells and
buys bitcoins for euros and other currencies. Direct exchangeability
to an existing currency would give bitcoin the best possible initial
liquidity and thus the best adoptability for new users. Everyone
accepts payment in coins that are easily exchangeable for common
money, but not everyone accepts payment in coins that are only
guaranteed to buy a specific kind of a product.

The instructional formula for stable pricing in euros would be something like:

(The amount of euros that you&#39;re ready to trade for bc + the
euro-value of goods that other people are selling for bc) /
(Total number of bc in circulation - own bc assets).

So if there&#39;s a total of 1M bitcoins of which you own 100K, you have
1000 eur and no one else trades with bitcoin yet, you can safely offer the
exchange rate of 1 eur / 900 bc, without having to devaluate
even if everyone sold their coins to you. This could be guaranteed as
the minimal exchange rate, but the rate could be also higher when
demand is high.

Initially, when others aren&#39;t yet offering anything for bitcoins, you
can increase your bitcoin assets cheaply - for the minimum price that
people bother to do the transaction for. If you had all the existing
coins for yourself, you could set the price to whatever you want,
because you wouldn&#39;t face the risk of having to buy even a single coin
with that price (not counting the new money created by others). So
it&#39;s best to get as much coins as possible before backing bitcoin with
all your available euros.

Profit can be gained, as usually in trading, by having a margin
between the buying and selling prices. Making Bitcoin as usable as
possible will make the business run better, as people do not only want
to sell all their coins to you, but also want to buy them and use them
as a medium of exchange.

At its simplest this exchange service could be a website where
traders, who can be individual persons, can post their rates, and
random users can leave trade requests. Some kind of an average rate
estimate could be shown on the site. Small-scale trading by
individuals would be outside legal hassle in most countries, and
putting all the eggs in the same basket would be avoided.

Another idea, which could be additional to the previous one, would be
an automated exchange service. The service would automatically
calculate the exchange rate and perform the transactions. This would
be nicer to the user: completion of the transaction request would be
certain and instantaneous. Making this service might actually be quite
easy if there was a command line interface to Bitcoin: just take any
web application framework and use PayPal back-end integration to
automatically send euros when Bitcoins are received, and vice versa.
This kind of business would also work great on larger scale if you set
up a company and take care of all the bureaucracy needed to practice
currency exchange. (I actually have a registered company that I&#39;ve
used for billing of some IT work, I could use that as a base.)

This exchange business thing is something that I&#39;d be interested in
doing, and I also have the sufficient technical skills to do it.
Although, before this can be done, there should be a non-alpha version
of Bitcoin (and the command line interface / API).

&gt; There are donors I can tap if we come up with something that needs
&gt; funding, but they want to be anonymous, which makes it hard to actually
&gt; do anything with it.

If this gets started, donors / high-risk investors would be very
welcome to bring capital for the currency&#39;s backup.

So, what do you think about the idea? Note that this is not something
that I&#39;m asking you to do (unless you want to) if you&#39;re busy with
other things. I can do it myself, if I get positive reviews about the
plan.

Next I&#39;m going to implement the &#34;minimize to tray&#34; feature and the  
option to autostart Bitcoin with Windows, so the number of nodes  
online would stay higher. After that I could see if I can do a Linux  
port or the command line interface needed for web app frameworks.

Drop by at #bitcoin-dev on FreeNode some time if you use IRC.

And again, thanks for the great work you&#39;ve done with Bitcoin.

        <pre>That&#39;s a good point that since you know how many coins exist and how 
fast new ones are created, you could set a support price based on the 
amount of legacy currency you have and be sure you&#39;ll have enough to 
meet all demands.  I had imagined an auction, but it would be far 
simpler and more confidence inspiring to back it at a specific exchange 
rate.

Offering currency to back bitcoins would attract freebie seekers, with 
the benefit of attracting a lot of publicity.  At first it would mostly 
be seen as a way to get free money for your computer&#39;s idle time.  Maybe 
pitched like help support the future of e-commerce and get a little 
money for your computer&#39;s spare cycles.  As people cash in and actually 
get paid, word would spread exponentially.

It might help to keep the minimum transaction size above an amount which 
a typical user would be able to accumulate with one computer, so that 
users have to trade with each other for someone to collect enough to 
cash in.  Aggregators would set up shop to buy bitcoins in smaller 
increments, which would add confidence in users ability to sell bitcoins 
if there are more available buyers than just you.

People would obviously be sceptical at first that the backing will hold 
up against an onslaught of people trying to get the free money, but as 
the competition raises the proof-of-work difficulty, it should become 
clear that bitcoins stay scarce.  People will see that they can&#39;t just 
get all the bitcoins they want.  It would establish a minimum value 
under bitcoins enabling them to be used for other purposes if, 
hopefully, other purposes are waiting for something to use.

&gt;&gt; It would help if there was something for people to use it for.  We need
&gt;&gt; an application to bootstrap it.  Any ideas?

&gt; accepts payment in coins that are easily exchangeable for common
&gt; money, but not everyone accepts payment in coins that are only

That would be more powerful if there was also some narrow product market 
to use it for.  Some virtual currencies like Tencent&#39;s Q coin have made 
headway with virtual goods.  It would be sweet if there was some way to 
horn in on a market like that as the official virtual currency gets 
clamped down on with limitations.  Not saying it can&#39;t work without 
something, but a ready specific transaction need that it fills would 
increase the certainty of success.

&gt; At its simplest this exchange service could be a website where
&gt; traders, who can be individual persons, can post their rates, and

&gt; estimate could be shown on the site. Small-scale trading by
&gt; individuals would be outside legal hassle in most countries, and
&gt; putting all the eggs in the same basket would be avoided.

Basically like an eBay site with user reviews to try to establish which 
sellers can be trusted.  The escrow feature will help but not solve 
everything.  It would be far more work to set up such a site than just 
to set up a single exchange site of your own, and there won&#39;t be enough 
users to make it go until later.  I&#39;m thinking it wouldn&#39;t make sense to 
make an eBay type site until later.

&gt; Another idea, which could be additional to the previous one, would be

&gt; used for billing of some IT work, I could use that as a base.)

Even if you had automation, you&#39;d probably want to review orders 
manually before processing them anyway.  It wouldn&#39;t be hard to process 
orders by hand, especially at first.  You could always set a minimum 
order size to keep orders more infrequent.

&gt; This exchange business thing is something that I&#39;d be interested in
&gt; doing, and I also have the sufficient technical skills to do it.

That&#39;s great, I could probably get a donor to send currency to you which 
you convert to euros and pay out through methods that are convenient for 
users.  I don&#39;t want to do an exchange business myself, but it can be 
done independently of me.  Like you say, there is more software 
development to be done first, and also I&#39;d like to keep trying for a 
while to think of a bootstrap application to use bitcoins for.  I&#39;ve had 
some ideas that could only be done before an exchange exists.

BTW, I tried to buy bitcoin.com before I started but there was no 
chance, it&#39;s owned by a professional domain speculator.  It&#39;s normal for 
open source projects to have .org so it&#39;s not so bad.

        <pre>Glad that worked, it&#39;s a pain that the dependencies are so big and hard 
to build.  Some of them give little attention to the Windows build. 
Next time I update to the latest versions, maybe I&#39;ll lay everything out 
in one directory tree and bundle the whole thing up into a giant archive.

I&#39;m not sure they had wxPack before.  I&#39;m glad they got that so everyone 
doesn&#39;t have to build wxWidgets themselves.  OpenSSL is the harder one 
to build.

I reduced the EXE size by running strip.exe on it to take out the debug 
symbols.  That&#39;s with mingw.  That&#39;s the better compiler, I only used VC 
  for debugging.

Bitcoin could be promoted to the users of virtual communities like  
World of Warcraft and Second Life, which both have millions of users.  
It would be great if not only peer-to-peer item traders, but also  
providers of some existing virtual services that already have a lot of  
customers, were to adopt the currency early on.

A programming question: What do you think about using the Boost&#39;s  
program_options to write settings like the transaction fee into a file  
bitcoin.config? Or is it better to save them in the database as it is  
now? Having a config file would make it easier to change the settings  
when running the program on a remote server with a console access only.

&gt; option to autostart Bitcoin with Windows, so the number of nodes online 
&gt; would stay higher. 

Now that I think about it, you&#39;ve put your finger on the most important 
missing feature right now that would make an order of magnitude 
difference in the number of nodes.  Without auto-run, we&#39;ll almost never 
retain nodes after an initial tryout interest.  Auto-running as a 
minimized tray icon by default was the key to success for the early file 
sharing networks.  It wouldn&#39;t have been appropriate for v0.1.0 when 
stability wasn&#39;t a given yet, but now it&#39;s good and stable.  This is a 
must-have feature for the next release so any users that come back to 
try the new version we hopefully retain this time.

I think the most user friendly way of doing auto-run is putting an icon 
in the Startup folder.  I see OpenOffice.org and a number of other 
things on my computer do it that way.  The other way, creating a runas 
registry entry, is not easily visible or editable by users, I&#39;ve never 
liked that much.  I guess what we want is an auto-run option that&#39;s on 
by default, if the option is changed then it creates or deletes the 
startup icon.

While it&#39;s tempting to do a Linux port, once we do it we have that extra 
work with every release from then on.  I&#39;d rather put it off a while 
longer.  Auto-run might give us 300% more nodes while Linux might give 
us 3% more.  Linux would help server farms, but actually we&#39;d like to 
favour individual users.  Someone reported that it works fine in WinE.

go in before any next release.  Some things based on questions and 
feedback I&#39;ve received that&#39;ll reduce confusion.  I&#39;ll probably enable 
multi-proc generating support, and hopefully make it safe to just backup 
wallet.dat to backup your money.  It&#39;s good to be coding again!

I&#39;m going to hide the transaction fee setting, which is completely not 
needed and only serves to confuse people.  It was only there for testing 
and demonstration of a technical detail that can only be needed in the 
far away future, if ever, but was necessary to implement at the 
beginning to make it possible later.

What was the problem with the shortcut in the startup folder?  If you 
could send me the code, I&#39;d like to take another look and see if I can 
see what the problem was.  The first strcat in the registry code should 
be strcpy, otherwise it would fail intermittently.  If the same code was 
in the shortcut one, maybe that was the problem.

It&#39;s encouraging to see more people taking an interest such as that 
NewLibertyStandard site.  I like his approach to estimating the value 
based on electricity.  It&#39;s educational to see what explanations people 
adopt.  They may help discover a simplified way of understanding it that 
makes it more accessible to the masses.  Many complex concepts in the 
world have a simplistic explanation that satisfies 80% of people, and a 
complete explanation that satisfies the other 20% who see the flaws in 
the simplistic explanation.

        <pre>Well, the code worked and made a shortcut in the startup folder. For  
some reason it didn&#39;t automatically start when booting, but worked  
fine when you clicked on it in the menu. Now I tried making a shortcut  
manually, and this time it works on autostart, don&#39;t know why. I could  
try again with the older code.

&gt; I got it, I see you checked in the startup folder code before changing
&gt; it to registry.  I don&#39;t see any visible problems in the code.  I guess
&gt; it depends what exactly the problem was with it not always working by
&gt; default.  Was there a Vista/UAC security problem?

        <pre>Yeah, I put back your startup folder shortcut code and it started fine 
for me too on XP and Vista.  For good measure, I changed it to make the 
shortcut settings look identical to one I manually created.  I set the 
working directory to where the EXE is since that&#39;s where debug.log is 
created, otherwise windows puts it in some weird directory.  I didn&#39;t 
change the setup script yet.

I checked everything in to SVN (thanks for setting that up)
- multi-proc generate
- flush wallet.dat after every change so the DB doesn&#39;t leave that stuff 
in the transaction logs
- view menu checkbox to hide all generated coins so you can see just 
your payment transactions
- disabled transaction fee option
- made the minimize to tray options similar to Firefox&#39;s MinimizeToTray
- bunch of other misc changes since the 0.1.5 release

I made it not show non-accepted generated coins.  It won&#39;t show 
generated coins until they have at least one confirmation (one block 
linked after it), so usually they&#39;ll just never be seen.  Occasionally a 
generated coin that was displayed might disappear because it became not 
accepted later.  I don&#39;t think anyone would notice the occasional 
non-accepteds if we didn&#39;t point them out in the UI.  People have told 
me they find it annoying to have to look at them, as they&#39;re permanently 
displayed in the transaction record.

I still have more testing to do.  I guess we gotta test Windows 7 now.

&gt;  Do you Windows users experience occasional Bitcoin crashes?
&gt; Lately Bitcoin running in wine-1.0.1 has been crashing frequently. I was
&gt; just wondering whether this is a Wine issue or a Bitcoin issue. 

I haven&#39;t had any reports of crashes in v0.1.5.  It&#39;s been rock solid 
for me on Windows.  I think it must be Wine related.  If you get another 
crash in Wine and it prints anything on the terminal, e-mail me and I 
may be able to figure out what happened, maybe something I can work 
around.  Martti and I have been working on a new version to release soon 
and it would be nice to get any Wine fixes in there.

&gt; The following four lines print from the terminal when I start Bitcoin.
&gt; fixme:toolhelp:CreateToolhelp32Snapshot Unimplemented: heap list snapshot
&gt; fixme:toolhelp:Heap32ListFirst : stub
&gt; fixme:toolhelp:CreateToolhelp32Snapshot Unimplemented: heap list snapshot
&gt; fixme:toolhelp:Heap32ListFirst : stub

Those don&#39;t look like anything to worry about.  Probably functions 
unimplemented by Wine that are harmlessly stubbed out.

&gt; I previously wasn&#39;t starting Bitcoin from the terminal, so I don&#39;t know what
&gt; gets printed out when it crashes, but I&#39;ll reply with the results the next
&gt; time it crashes.
&gt; 
&gt; While Bitcoin first downloads previously completed blocks, the file
&gt; debug.log grows grows to 17.4 MB and then stops growing. I imagine it will
&gt; continue to grow as more bitcoins are completed.

You can delete debug.log occasionally if you don&#39;t want to take the disk 
space.  It&#39;s just status messages that help with debugging.

bitcoin.sourceforge.net looks fine now.  Maybe sourceforge was doing 
some maintenance.

  It&#39;s such a standard, more often than not any given project has a

Is there a way to make Bitweaver allow users to edit (and maybe delete)

Getting antsy to port to Linux?  It&#39;s not a decision to be taken lightly 
because once it&#39;s done, it doubles my testing and building workload. 
Although I am worried about Liberty&#39;s Wine crashes.

I&#39;ve tried to be as portable as possible and use standard C stuff 
instead of Windows calls.  The threading is _beginthread which is part 
of the standard C library.  wxWidgets has wxCriticalSection stuff we can 
use.  The sockets code is send/recv stuff which I think is the same as 
unix because Microsoft ported sockets from BSD.  We need direct control 
over sockets, it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to get behind an abstraction 
layer.  wxWidgets is a good place to look for cross-platform support 
functions.  I want to avoid #ifdefing up the code if we can.  Anything 
that&#39;s used more than once probably becomes a function in util.cpp that 
has the #ifdef in it.

BTW, I have a lot of uncommitted changes right now because it includes 
some crucial protocol transitions that can&#39;t be unleashed on the network 
until I&#39;ve tested the heck out of it.  It shouldn&#39;t be too much longer.

Can you make the setup uninstall the Startup folder icon?  I figure it 
should install and uninstall an icon in a regular program group, and 
just uninstall the Startup folder one.  I guess it doesn&#39;t matter that 
much whether it installs and uninstalls the Startup folder icon or just 
uninstalls it.

It&#39;s not possible with the current version of Bitweaver. Bitweaver&#39;s  
wiki and forum packages aren&#39;t so very highly advanced. SF hosting  
also has its disadvantages, like the occasional slowness and lack of  
e-mailer and user IP retrieving. I&#39;ve been considering to buy web  
hosting from prq.se (the host of Wikileaks and Pirate Bay, among  
others) to be used later for the exchange service. I could maybe host  
the project site there as well, under a separate user account for  
better security. There I could set up Drupal or TikiWiki, which are  
more advanced and have quite a lot bigger and more active  
developer/user communities than Bitweaver.

        <pre>The easy solution I took was to look at the wxWidgets source code and 
see how they did it.  They just mapped it to wxMutex on non-MSW, which 
does have TryEnter, so that mapped in perfectly.

I checked in all my backlog of changes to SVN, including the overhaul of 
CCriticalSection in util.h and OpenSSL&#39;s mutex callback in util.cpp to 
do everything with wxWidgets when not on Windows.

If we get it working on Linux, I&#39;ll run my test suite against it here 
off-network first, then we can give an unreleased build to 
LibertyStandard to test for a while before going public.

can be a no-op on Linux.  OpenSSL automatically uses /dev/urandom to 
seed on Linux, so RandAddSeedPerfmon can also be a no-op.

Don&#39;t let it connect to the network before we&#39;ve tested it thoroughly 
off-net.  If you have two computers, unplug the internet and use 
&#34;bitcoin -connect=&lt;ip&gt;&#34; to connect to each other, one windows and one 
linux.  -connect will allow you to connect to non-routable addresses 
like 192.168.x.x.  We don&#39;t want to reflect badly on the reliability of 
the network if it throws off some malformed crud we hadn&#39;t thought to 
check for yet, or discovers something else anti-social to do on the network.

I have time that I can do some testing when you&#39;ve got something 
buildable to test.  I can include it in the stress test I&#39;m currently 
running on the changes so far.

        <pre>Great, I&#39;ve been looking forward to working on the Linux build.

If you connect to Freenode&#39;s hidden service, then they tell you they&#39;ve 
also banned TOR from that due to abuse and it kicks you off.  There&#39;s a 
several step procedure you can do to run a password utility on unix and 
e-mail request an account that you could login with, but that&#39;s getting 
pretty complicated.  I wonder if we could get away with applying for one 
account and then everyone use the same account?  I suppose the IRC 
server probably limits accounts to one login, or some admin might not 
like to see a dozen logins on the same account.

Besides the IRC part, how did your test of proxy go?  Since you&#39;ve been 
connected before, your addr.dat contains known node addresses, but 
without IRC to know which ones are online, it takes a long time to find 
them.  There are normally 1 to 3 other nodes besides you that can accept 
incoming connections, and existing nodes that already know you would 
eventually connect to you.  How many connections did you get, and how 
long did it take?  I guess to know whether it successfully connected 
outbound through TOR you&#39;d need to search debug.log for &#34;connected&#34;.

To originally connect with TOR without connecting normally once to get 
seeded, you&#39;d have to know the address of an existing node that can 
accept incoming connections and seed it like this:
bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -addnode=&lt;ip of a node&gt;

If some nodes that accept incoming connects were willing to have their 
IP coded into the program, it could seed automatically.  Or some IP seed 
addresses posted on a Wiki page with the instructions.

Another option is to search the world again for an IRC server that 
doesn&#39;t ban TOR nodes.  Or if we could get someone to set one up.  IRC 
servers ban TOR because they have actual text chat on them... if there 
was one with just bots and junk then it wouldn&#39;t care.  Probably should 
post a question on the forum or the mailing list and see if anyone knows 
one.

Another problem is that TOR users can&#39;t accept incoming connections, and 
we have so few that can.  If everyone goes to TOR, there won&#39;t be any 
nodes to connect to.

We have a shortage of nodes that can accept incoming connections.  It 
generally ranges from 2 to 4 lately.  We need to emphasize the 
importance to people of setting up port forwarding on their router. 
Every P2P file sharing program has instructions how to do it.  We should 
have a paragraph on the bitcoin.sourceforge.net homepage urging people 
to set up port forwarding to accept incoming connections, and a link to 
a site that describes how to do it for each router.

        <pre>It was almost there.  I fixed a few things and got it to finish 
compiling but I don&#39;t know the system libraries to link to so there&#39;s 
undefined references galore.

I changed the makefile to look for things under /usr/local and in their 
default &#34;make install&#34; locations.  I wrote what I did and switches I 
used in build-unix.txt.  I&#39;m currently using wxWidgets 2.8.9 for now 
because it&#39;s the same version as on Windows and I don&#39;t want to wonder 
if there&#39;s version change issues at the same time as platform change. 
2.8.10 or 2.9.0 are probably fine though.  I went with the 
single-library compile of wxWidgets since we&#39;re linking to almost every 
library anyway.

I added xpm files, which is what they use everywhere else but Windows 
instead of RC files.  They&#39;re clever C files that define graphics in 
static arrays.  The bitcoin icon has 5 different versions but I couldn&#39;t 
figure out how that works in xpm so I only put the biggest one.  Maybe 
on GTK it scales it for you.  I don&#39;t know if these are right or what, 
but they compile.

There are debian packages available for some of the dependencies instead

apt-get install build-essential

I need to see if Berkeley DB or Boost have packages.

We&#39;ll shared-link OpenSSL, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s always preinstalled on

Enabling the proxy setting and restarting Bitcoin I got the first  
connections in less than a minute and ultimately even 8 connections. I  
wonder if they&#39;re all really through TOR. Netstat shows only 2  
connections to localhost:9050 and 7 connections from local port 8333  
to elsewhere. (Some of the shown connections may be already  
disconnected ones.) For some reason there&#39;s no debug.log in the folder  
where I&#39;m running it.

&gt; If some nodes that accept incoming connects were willing to have their
&gt; IP coded into the program, it could seed automatically.  Or some IP
&gt; seed addresses posted on a Wiki page with the instructions.

The wiki page sounds like a good and quickly applicable solution. I  
could keep my ip updated there and we could ask others to do the same.  
When the Linux build works, it&#39;s easier to set up nodes on servers  
that are online most of the time and have a static IP. A static ip  
list shipped with Bitcoin and a peer exchange protocol would be cool.  
That way there&#39;d be no need for an IRC server.

Ok. I didn&#39;t get it linked on the first attempt, but I didn&#39;t look

debug.log moved to the data directory &#34;%appdata%/bitcoin/debug.log&#34;

7 inbound and 2 outbound sounds about as expected.

My last SVN commit included an overhaul of the code that selects the 
order of addresses to connect to, trying them in the order of most 
recently seen online, so it should get connected in a more reasonable 
amount of time if IRC is unavailable.  IRC is really only needed to seed 
the first connection, but we&#39;ve been using it as a crutch to get 
connected faster.

That would be great.  It&#39;s only TOR users that need it, so in the 
instructions saying &#34;bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -addnode=&lt;someip&gt;&#34;, 
someip could be an actual static IP, with the wiki free-for-all 
add-your-ip list nearby or a link to it.  There should be a link to that optional step, add your IP to this list now that you can accept incoming 
if you&#39;re static.

Do you think anonymous people are looking to be completely stealth, as 
in never connect once without TOR so nobody knows they use bitcoin, or 
just want to switch to TOR before doing any transactions?  It&#39;s just if 
you want to be completely stealth that you&#39;d have to go through the 
-proxy -addnode manual seeding.  It would be very easy to fumble that 
up; if you run bitcoin normally to begin with it immediately 
automatically starts connecting.

bitweaver forum feature is just too lightweight.  I assume the &#34;Forum&#34;

I&#39;ve seen projects that have major following just from forum talk and 
pie-in-the-sky planning without even having any code yet.  Having a lot 
of forum talk gives a project more presence on the net, more search 
hits, makes it look big, draws new users in, helps solve support 
questions, hashes out what features are most of wanted.

It would be a big plus if it could support SSL, at least for the login 
page if not sitewide.  Multiple people on the forum have expressed 
interest in TOR/I2P, and those users need SSL because a lot of TOR exit 
nodes are probably password scrapers run by identity thieves.  A lot of 
the core interest in Bitcoin is going to be from the privacy crowd.

Any ideas where we can get a free forum?  Maybe we should look at where 
some other projects have their forums hosted for ideas where to look.

        <pre>It works reliably on Linux now, except if it uses wxMessageBox() outside 
the GUI thread, it&#39;ll crash because non-GUI threads can&#39;t open a window 
on Linux.  I haven&#39;t got to fixing that yet.  I&#39;ve been running my 
stress test on it and it&#39;s functioning normally.

Most of wxWidgets is not thread-safe to use in threads other than the UI 
thread, but as a rule of thumb on Windows anything not UI related is OK. 
  It turns out its more thread-unsafe on GTK.  I replaced a bunch of 
stuff at once so I don&#39;t know if it was just one thing (probably 
Repaint), but I have to assume even any wx function that uses wxString 
is not safe to use outside the UI thread.  So dang, there goes all the 
nice wxWidgets portability support functions.  I left a few simple 
things like wxThread::GetCPUCount() that I checked the source and it&#39;s 
all numerical, and wxMutex has to be safe or it&#39;d be useless.

There&#39;s an issue that if you exit and run it again right away, it can&#39;t 
bind port 8333.  The port frees up after about a minute.  Unless I&#39;m 
missing something, I am closing the socket before exit, so I don&#39;t know 
what else I can do.  Maybe this is just something about Linux that it 
takes a minute to free up a port you had bound.  Possibly a security 
feature so some trojan doesn&#39;t kill the web server and quickly jump into 
its place and pick up all the client retries.

Still gotta figure out how to do the xpm version of the icon correctly.

I wonder if the database dat files are interchangeable with Windows.

The people who are interested in being stealthy tend to be more

instructions to get perfect secrecy. Of course there could be a  
connect-button in the UI that needs to be clicked before use, but the

One option would be ning.com. Ning.com is a popular community site and  
many users who already have an account wouldn&#39;t need to register a new  
account. Example: http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/. This seems to  
support SSL.

Another option would be to relocate the whole site to some place where  
we can run Drupal or TikiWiki. I&#39;ve been thinking of buying virtual  
server or web hosting for the exchange service sometime soon, and if  
the platform allows for two separate accounts, we could run the site  
there too. The CMS and its database can be always copied and relocated  
to a new web host if needed.

        <pre>In the debug.log, it requests the block list, receives the block list, 
then begins uploading the list of blocks requested.  It doesn&#39;t receive 
the blocks, but it didn&#39;t run long enough for me to be sure it would 
have had time yet.  Everything else looks normal.

How long did you run it?  It could take a few minutes to start 
downloading the blocks.  Especially if you&#39;re on a cable modem, the 
uplink can be much lower bandwidth so it would take some time to upload 
the block request list.

If you run it again and it still doesn&#39;t download blocks, keep it 
running for several hours at least and then send me the debug.log.  That 
should give it time for my node to connect to you and I could see what 
it says on my side and correlate it with your debug.log.

You&#39;re right about the minimize on close option, there&#39;s no reason that 
can&#39;t be separate.  Martti originally had it separate and I made it a 
sub-option, my bad.  I&#39;ll change it back.

&gt; A good way for you to test the tray icon in Gnome is to remove the 
&gt; notification area and then add it back. If the icon is still displayed 
&gt; after adding the notification back, then it&#39;s working correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; I generally set application preferences to not minimize to the tray, but 
&gt; to close to the tray. And I keep the application minimized. That way I 
&gt; don&#39;t accidentally close the program and still have the convenience of 
&gt; being able to open the application from the tray. (I don&#39;t display open 
&gt; windows in the &#39;task bar&#39; but I have an icon that if clicked displays 
&gt; open windows as sub-menu items.) Then if the tray icon disappears, I go 
&gt; into the settings disable and re-enable the tray icon setting to get it 
&gt; to reappear. That&#39;s currently not possible with the bitcoin preferences 
&gt; because the close to tray check mark can not be enabled without the 
&gt; minimize to tray check box being enabled.

&gt;     We haven&#39;t figured out how to find and bring up the existing running

fits about 4 threads on a page, posts are treated like news articles or 
blog posts with reply comments at the bottom.  It&#39;s more of a social

I&#39;m thinking phpBB or IPB or similar.  One line of text per thread, 
small fonts, efficient use of vertical space.  Most people are already 
familiar with the interface.

Martti, how long did it take to start downloading blocks when you ran

It already uses SO_REUSEADDR so it can bind to the port if it&#39;s in 
TIME_WAIT state after being closed.  The only time it should fail to 
bind is when the program really is already running.  It&#39;s important that 
two copies of Bitcoin not run on the same machine at once because they 
would be modifying the database at the same time.  There is never any 
need to run two on one machine as coin generation will now use multiple 
processors automatically.

I&#39;m not sure what those lib errors are, I&#39;ll do some searching.

        <pre>Thanks for that, I see what happened.  Because the first one was slow, 
it ended up requesting the blocks from everybody else, which only bogged 
everything down.  I can fix this, I just need to think a while about the 
right way.

There&#39;s no risk in shutting down while there are unconfirmed.  When you 
make a transaction or new block, it immediately broadcasts it to the 
network.  After that, the increasing #/confirmed number is just 
monitoring the outcome.  There&#39;s nothing your node does during that time 
to promote the acceptance.

Now that I think about it, when you close Bitcoin, it closes the main 
window immediately but in the background continues running to finish an 
orderly flush and shutdown of the database.  Before I implemented that, 
it was annoying having a dead hung unresponsive window hanging around. 
Until it finishes the orderly shutdown in the background, the port would 
be locked, and this is an important protection to make sure another copy 
can&#39;t touch the database until it&#39;s done.  I haven&#39;t seen the shutdown 
take more than a few seconds.

In Wine, there&#39;s no way for the Windows version to do SO_REUSEADDR, so 
that would add 60 seconds (on my system) of TIME_WAIT after the port is 
closed.

If you need to transfer between two copies, you could send it to the 
other&#39;s bitcoin address.  The receiving copy doesn&#39;t have to be online 
at the time.

The command line to use a different data directory is
bitcoin -datadir=&lt;directory&gt;

For example, on Linux, the default directory is (don&#39;t use ~)
bitcoin -datadir=/home/yourusername/.bitcoin

You shouldn&#39;t normally have any need to use this switch.  It still won&#39;t 
let you run two instances at once.

&gt; It took about a half hour for it to start incrementing quickly.

&gt; The reason I run two instances at the same time is to transfer bitcoins

&gt; accessing different data directories. Perhaps that could be specified as 
&gt; a command line argument. I currently have to move my bitcoin data folder 
&gt; to a virtual machine to do this. Shutting down bitcoin and restarting it 
&gt; with a different data directory is a poor solution because shutting down 
&gt; bitcoin while there are unconfirmed bitcoins risks losing those bitcoins.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin was definitely not running when i get the busy port error. The 
&gt; process closes quickly and reliably from my experience, but it takes 
&gt; anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes (estimation from memory) for the 
&gt; port to become available again. It occurred while switching from bitcoin 
&gt; 0.1.5 in Wine to the Linux build and again while switching from the 
&gt; Linux build to bitcoin 0.1.5 in Wine.
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing that I noticed is that the about dialog text does not fit 
&gt; correctly and it cannot be resized.

        <pre>You really don&#39;t want to keep running in Wine, you&#39;re getting database 
errors (db.log).  You probably developed these rituals of transferring 
to a fresh install to cope with database corruption.  If there is a way 
to lose unconfirmed blocks, it would have to be the database errors. 
Any problems you find in the Linux build can be fixed.  The Wine 
incompatibility deep inside Berkeley DB is unfixable.

I think GCC 4.3.3 on the Linux build optimized the SHA-256 code better 
than the old GCC 3.4.5 on Windows.  When I was looking for the best 
SHA-256 code, there was a lot of hand tuned highly optimized SHA1 code 
available, but not so much for SHA-256 yet.  I should see if I can 
upgrade MinGW to 4.3.x to get them on a level playing field.

        <pre>I see what happened.  All your sockets went dead somehow.  You had no 
communication with the network, but because you had 8 zombie 
connections, it thought it was still online and kept generating blocks. 
  You can tell this is happening when your blocks are numbered 
sequentially, without other people&#39;s blocks interspersed, like:
2/unconfirmed
3/unconfirmed
4/unconfirmed
5/unconfirmed
6 blocks
7 blocks

It&#39;s implausible that you would be the only one to find blocks for 6 
blocks in a row like that.

When you exited and restarted, it connected and downloaded 45 blocks 
that the network found in your absence.  Since your blocks were not 
broadcast to the network immediately, the network went on without them.

It sounds like you had exactly the same problem on Wine.  There&#39;s 
clearly something about socket handling on Linux that&#39;s effecting it 
either way.

I&#39;ll start researching this.  Ultimately if I can&#39;t find the root of the 
problem, I&#39;ll have to make some kind of mechanism to watch for an 
absence of messages and disconnect.  The only workaround for you right 
now would be to exit and restart more often.

All but one of your node connections went dead at the same time, one 
shortly after.  IRC was still working, so it wasn&#39;t that you were 
offline from the internet.

I wonder if the status of blocks should say &#34;#/unconfirmed&#34; all the way

of the number isn&#39;t as strong for blocks as for transactions.

I think it would be an improvement not to count one&#39;s own blocks as 
confirmations.  A drawback would be that the status numbers shown by 
different nodes would not match.  The status number would no longer be 
coordinated with the maturity countdown on blocks either.  A lighter 
option would be a special case only if all confirmations are your own.

        <pre>I fixed a few places I found where it was possible for a socket to get 
an error and not get disconnected.  If your connections go dead again, 
it should disconnect and reconnect them.  I also implemented an 
inactivity timeout as a fallback.

This also includes a partial fix for the slow initial block download.

You should run with the &#34;-debug&#34; switch to get some additional debug.log 
information I added that&#39;ll help if there are more problems.

&gt; I see what happened.  All your sockets went dead somehow.  You had no

&gt;  You can tell this is happening when your blocks are numbered 
&gt; sequentially, without other people&#39;s blocks interspersed, like:
&gt; 2/unconfirmed
&gt; 3/unconfirmed
&gt; 4/unconfirmed
&gt; 5/unconfirmed
&gt; 6 blocks
&gt; 7 blocks
&gt; 
&gt; It&#39;s implausible that you would be the only one to find blocks for 6 
&gt; blocks in a row like that.
&gt; 
&gt; When you exited and restarted, it connected and downloaded 45 blocks 
&gt; that the network found in your absence.  Since your blocks were not 
&gt; broadcast to the network immediately, the network went on without them.
&gt; 
&gt; It sounds like you had exactly the same problem on Wine.  There&#39;s 
&gt; clearly something about socket handling on Linux that&#39;s effecting it 
&gt; either way.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ll start researching this.  Ultimately if I can&#39;t find the root of the 
&gt; problem, I&#39;ll have to make some kind of mechanism to watch for an 
&gt; absence of messages and disconnect.  The only workaround for you right 
&gt; now would be to exit and restart more often.
&gt; 
&gt; All but one of your node connections went dead at the same time, one 
&gt; shortly after.  IRC was still working, so it wasn&#39;t that you were 
&gt; offline from the internet.
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if the status of blocks should say &#34;#/unconfirmed&#34; all the way 
&gt; up to maturity (119/unconfirmed then 120 blocks) instead.  The meaning 
&gt; of the number isn&#39;t as strong for blocks as for transactions.

        <pre>Right now (04:50 GMT) my node is connecting to yours and getting zombie 
connections each time.  The socket isn&#39;t returning an error, just zombie 
without notice.  If you&#39;re running the linux build right now, it would 
be interesting to see what the log says on your side.

test3:

I&#39;ve added specific code to detect zombie sockets.  It&#39;ll detect if the 
socket hasn&#39;t sent or received any data within 60 seconds of connecting, 
and detect if data is queued to send and hasn&#39;t sent for 3 minutes.

I think I may have weakened the reconnect speed in test2.  In test3 I&#39;m 
making it more determined to reconnect quickly.

I added checking to track whether other nodes received your generated 
blocks.  If none did, it&#39;ll warn you in the description:
&#34;Generated - Warning: This block was not received by any other nodes and 
will probably not be accepted!&#34;

The status can go to &#34;#/offline?&#34; for blocks or transactions you create 
if they don&#39;t get out to any other nodes.

With all this, it should be impossible not to notice as soon as it 
screws up.  It should hopefully disconnect all the zombie sockets. 
After that, whether it&#39;s able to make some good connections, or sockets 
is completely hosed and it stays at 0 connections, I don&#39;t know.

If this doesn&#39;t work, I guess I&#39;ll look at the sourcecode of some other 
P2P apps like BitTorrent and see how they deal with this stuff.  Maybe 
there&#39;s some magic flag or procedure to bash the sockets system back to 
life.

        <pre>test 5:

I added MSG_DONTWAIT to the send and recv calls in case they forgot the 
socket is non-blocking.  If that doesn&#39;t work, there&#39;s now the catch-all 
solution: another thread monitors the send/recv thread and terminates 
and restarts it if it stops.  It prints &#34;*** Restarting 
ThreadSocketHandler ***&#34; in debug.log, and an error message displays on 
the status bar for a while.

Before terminating, it tries closing the socket that&#39;s hung.  If that 
works, it doesn&#39;t have to resort to terminating.

I ran a test where it terminated the thread about 1000 times without 
trouble, so it should be safe.  The terminate on linux is 
pthread_cancel, which throws it into C++&#39;s exception handler.

The thread calls we were using didn&#39;t have terminate, so I created our 
own wrappers in util.h to use CreateThread on windows and pthread_create 
on linux, instead of:
   _beginthread is windows only and lacks terminate
   boost::thread is really attractive, but lacks terminate
   wxThread requires you to create a class for every function you might 
call (yuck)

It doesn&#39;t support SSL, but none of them do.  I replaced the ugly 
default orange and blue theme with the Frostee theme, which was the only 
decent looking theme I could find after extensive searching.  Searching 
for themes is futile, there are thousands of rubbish themes.  It turns 
out the solution is to look at button sets instead 
(http://resources.zetaboards.com/forum/1000328/)

I only created two subforums to begin with.  I&#39;ll create new ones as the 
need arises.  I like to start with a flat namespace until there&#39;s enough 
items to justify subsections.  Technical Support makes sense as a 
separate section to get that stuff out of the main spotlight so our 
dirty laundry isn&#39;t in everyone&#39;s face, and to make people feel more 
free to report bugs there.  Mostly only devs and people checking on a 
bug need read the Technical Support section.

        <pre>linux-0.1.6-test5 solved Liberty&#39;s zombie socket problem.  The 
MSG_DONTWAIT fixed the root cause, it&#39;s not having to terminate and 
restart the thread.  The sockets are marked non-blocking already, so I 
don&#39;t understand why.  Maybe it forgot.  I suppose if a socket fails and 
the OS closes it then there&#39;s nothing left to remember it was 
non-blocking, but then accessing a closed handle should return 
immediately with an error.  There&#39;s no MSG_DONTWAIT on Windows, marking 
the socket as nonblocking is the only way, so if anyone runs the Windows 
version in Wine it will have to rely on terminating the thread.

The only problem now is the DB exceptions he&#39;s getting.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I had expected those to be a Wine problem, but he&#39;s getting them on
&gt;&gt;&gt; Linux just the same.  He tried moving the datadir to a different drive,
&gt;&gt;&gt; no help.  I&#39;ve never gotten them.  I&#39;m running a stress test that
&gt;&gt;&gt; continuously generates a lot of activity and DB access and never got it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; He has Ubuntu 64-bit and I have 32-bit, so I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s the
&gt;&gt;&gt; difference.  Is your Linux machine 64-bit or 32-bit?  Have you ever had
&gt;&gt;&gt; a DB exception? (see db.log also)  Now that the zombie problem is fixed
&gt;&gt;&gt; in test5, could you start running it on your Linux machine?  We could
&gt;&gt;&gt; use a 3rd vote to get a better idea of what we&#39;re dealing with here.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The DB exception is uncaught, so it&#39;ll stop the program if you get it.

might be better than bitcoinx.com.

Be careful where you search domain names, many will front-run you.  Even 
network solutions, although they&#39;ve said they won&#39;t if you use their 
whois page not the homepage.  The only safe place is 
http://www.internic.com/whois.html

&gt; Another name question: I&#39;ve been thinking of a name for the exchange

&gt; (bitcoinshop.com). Which one do you find better?
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I&#39;d better install 64-bit then.  I imagine it&#39;s something about the
&gt;&gt; 32-bit version of Berkeley DB on 64-bit Linux.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; BTW, in things like the feature list credits, do you want me to refer

What do you see as the benefits of switching the wiki?
Some I can think of:
  SSL
  get away from sourceforge&#39;s unreliable hosting
  everything not logged by sourceforge

The forum feature is about as weak as bitweaver.  We need a full blown 
forum software for that.

My priority right now is to get a forum going, either phpBB or similar. 
  What do you think of the zetaboards option?  Should we go ahead with that?

I think the biggest advantage is having a single site so you don&#39;t  
need a separate account for the wiki and the forum, and the  
functionalities are also nicely integrated with the main site itself.  
Also being ad-free is a plus.

How about Drupal&#39;s forum functionality? Address:

simpler than TikiWiki. If the forum&#39;s not good enough, then we can of  
course use a specialized forum software like phpBB.

        <pre>That&#39;s a good idea to go in a more web-publishing CMS type direction 
like Drupal.  That&#39;s a better fit and can produce a better looking 
website than a wiki.  I think I was wrong about wiki.  Only a few 
specific people will do any website design work and those people can go 
ahead and have a separate login.  In that case, login integration with 
the forum doesn&#39;t matter much.  For security, I&#39;d almost rather have a 
different login than be constantly checking the forum with the same 
login that could pwn the website.

Drupal&#39;s forum is less bad than the wikis, but still a long way from 
something I would want to use.

zetaboards pros and cons:

pros:
- we don&#39;t have to worry about bandwidth
- they handle the backend management and security patches

con:
- lack of SSL
- lack of privacy, everything is logged
- lack of control over the php code for customization
- no CAPTCHA, and if they add one later it might be unacceptable flash
- ads (could pay to get rid of them later if we care enough)
- there&#39;s always the risk they abruptly cancel the site for some petty 
reason

        <pre>test 7:

Backup your data directory before running this, just in case.

Workaround for the Db::open/Db::close &#34;Bad file descriptor&#34; exception. 
Might also make the initial block download faster.  The workaround is to 
open the database handles and keep them open for the duration of the 
program, which is actually the more common thing to do anyway.  If we&#39;re 
not closing and opening all the time, the error shouldn&#39;t get a chance 
to happen.

The one exception is wallet.dat, which I still close after writing is 
finished so I can flush the transaction logs into the dat file, making 
the dat file standalone.  That way if someone does a backup while 
Bitcoin is running, they&#39;ll get a wallet.dat that is valid by itself 
without the database transaction logs.

This is a restructuring of the database handling, so we might find some 
new deadlocks.  Usually if it deadlocks, either the UI will stop 
repainting, or it&#39;ll stop using CPU even though it still says Generating.

Another issue I thought of with zetaboards: most free forum sites won&#39;t 
let you export the user account database if you want to move.  I don&#39;t 
know why I don&#39;t see any other software projects using a free forum, but 
I have to assume there might be a reason we would discover later.

If you can install phpBB3 on your VPS, that&#39;s probably the better option.

 From what I&#39;ve seen on other forums, if the cost of bandwidth becomes 
an issue, a small Google Adwords (text links) at the top generates more 
than the cost of bandwidth even for very low value traffic like gaming. 
  This would be much higher value traffic well targeted for high paying 
gold merchant keywords and VPN hosts.  It could eventually be a valuable 
revenue stream you wouldn&#39;t want to give away to some free site.

I want to pre-announce some of the features in version 0.2 on the forum 
and try to get some anticipation going.  Even if hardly anyone else is 
posting, I have seen project forums where most of the posts are the 
author announcing what&#39;s going on with the latest changes.  Users can 
see progress going on, see that it&#39;s improving and supported and not 
abandonware.  It&#39;s a little like a blog in that case, but easier for 
users to use it as a searchable FAQ and better organized.  Whenever I 
google search software questions, most of the hits are forum posts.

        <pre>Finally an easy one.  I see a way that could happen on a long operation 
such as the initial download.  The TryLock bug is unrelated to the db 
stuff.  Fix will be in test8.

I&#39;ve been able to reproduce the db::open/close exception 3 times now on 
32-bit linux by hitting it with a continuous flood of non-stop requests. 
  It looks like even periodically closing the wallet.dat database to 
flush it gets the db::close exceptions.  I&#39;m disabling the wallet flush 
feature on Linux.  On Linux we&#39;ll never close a database handle until 
we&#39;re ready to exit.  So far with this disabled, no exceptions.

I&#39;m also implementing the orderly initial block download.  Instead of 
naively requesting all the blocks at once, it&#39;ll request batches of 500 
at a time.  This way, it&#39;ll receive the blocks before the retry timeout, 
so it shouldn&#39;t go requesting it from other nodes unless it actually 
doesn&#39;t receive them or it&#39;s too slow.  The change is in the requestee&#39;s 
side, so this functionality won&#39;t be visible until your initial block 
download is coming from a node that has the new version.

I&#39;m going to test this some more before sending test8.

        <pre>I&#39;ve been configuring the SMF forum.  They&#39;re saying SMF is better 
written than phpBB and more reliable, so if I can get SMF to look right, 
that&#39;s the preferable choice.

Most forums run vBulletin (big-boards.com lists 1376 vBulletin, 275 
Invision, 245 phpBB and 41 SMF), so if you don&#39;t look like vBulletin or 
Invision, it looks like you compromised because you couldn&#39;t afford 
vBulletin.  SMF&#39;s UI started out further away from the standard look, 
but I&#39;ve been able to use CSS to make it look more like the others.

I&#39;ve done as much as I can with CSS, the rest requires editing PHP files 
and uploading images.  The forum doesn&#39;t have a built in file 
upload/edit admin feature, it&#39;s added separately as the SMF File Manager 
mod.  I uploaded the mod but some files need to be chmod 777 so it can 
install.  If you go to Admin-&gt;Packages-&gt;Browse Packages and click on 
Apply Mod, it offers to do it automatically if you enter an ftp login.

Someone says you might also have to
mkdir /var/www/bitcoin/smf/packages/temp

The error in the error log is:
failed to open stream: Permission denied
File: /var/www/bitcoin/smf/Sources/Subs-Package.php
(I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just the first file)

Is it OK to go live with this SMF installation when I&#39;m finished 
configuring it?  I should be able to point forum.bitcoin.org to it.

Liberty reports that linux-test8 has been running smoothly.  My tests 
have been running fine as well.  The Linux version looks fully 
stabilized to me.

Good news: he says he made his first sale of bitcoins.  Someone bought 
out all he had.  I had been wondering whether it would be buyers or sellers.

It&#39;s okay to go live. Are you setting up a redirect or a dns entry? In

Great that the Linux build works now. It&#39;s exciting to see how things

DNS entry.

I&#39;m thinking of merging the bitcoin.org information with your site 
content so I can switch the whole bitcoin.org domain over.  We need to 
replace the current bitcoin.org site with a user-oriented site before 
the release.

If the website and forum switch at the same time, then forum.bitcoin.org 
isn&#39;t necessary unless we want it that way for looks.

Have you decided on the CMS to use?  I should research Drupal and other 
CMSes and see what&#39;s the most popular.

&gt; Great that the Linux build works now. It&#39;s exciting to see how things 
&gt; will start rolling with the new release and the forum. Not too long 
&gt; until I can set up my own exchange and start promoting the currency to 
&gt; (web) business people.

The linux version, setup exe, tor option and better website/forum will 
all increase the percentage of visitors who can use it, and the 
autostart and minimize to tray will increase how many keep running it. 
All those factors multiply together.

&gt; NewLibertyStandard should perhaps change his pricing to the market price 
&gt; (i.e. what people are willing to buy and sell for) so that he doesn&#39;t 
&gt; run out of coins.

It&#39;s good to start low and only have the price go up.

I really like that he explains the concept that the cost of electricity 
is a minimum floor under the price.  At a minimum you either have to pay 
the cost in electricity or pay someone the cost of production to make 
them for you.

        <pre>Thanks, that worked, I got File Manager installed with SSH.  I also 
uploaded a few themes into Drupal.  I haven&#39;t thoroughly gone through 
all the available themes yet.

Looked around at CMSes, Drupal and Joomla are popular.  Consensus is 
Joomla has a better selection of themes and is easier to learn, though 
Drupal may be more intuitive for programmers and customization.  Joomla 
better for CMS, Drupal better for blogs.  Drupal&#39;s URLs are search

Both have SMF bridge modules available.  For future reference, Drupal&#39;s 
is named &#34;SMFforum Integration&#34;.

We could see if we can get a free SSL certificate somewhere, like

        <pre>I&#39;ll go ahead with setting up Drupal then.

I don&#39;t think we should make the site https by default.  It&#39;s still very 
unusual for the public part of sites to be https, probably because it 
introduces potential technical complications, delays and greater server 
load.  As a user I&#39;m a little annoyed when it takes time to verify the 
identity of some no-name site I casually came across.  For me it seems 
like https sites fail to load a lot more often.

The important thing is to have SSL available for those who need it. 
Those who need SSL I think know to try inserting an &#34;s&#34; after http and 
see if it works.  SMF has code that changes all the links to https if 
the URL handed in is https.

We could add a note on the registration page that if you want SSL, you 
can change http to https at any time and approve the self-signed 
certificate, or a link that does it, and the TOR page can mention it too.

We can look into getting a certificate later when things have settled 
down.  With Class 1, no changes are allowed for a year, which is a risk 
if we find issues with the current host and have to change IP.

        <pre>We need to do a continuity transition with bitcoin.org so the search 
engines don&#39;t think this is a new site and reset the site start date and 
PR data.  Google allows a certain number of properties like IP address 
or content of the site to change without deleting your site history.  To 
play it safe, when the IP address changes, the content better stay the 
same and vice versa.  Even though not much rank has accumulated yet, the 
original start date becomes extremely important if the site gets popular 
later.

Steps:
1) copy the current bitcoin.org index.html to the new server exactly as-is.
2) switch the bitcoin.org DNS entry.
3) keep working on the drupal site behind the scenes.
4) after google has had time to update its records, we can switch over 
to the drupal site.

The timing works out well because we can switch to the new forum now and 
release the drupal site later when we&#39;re ready.

I&#39;ll see if I can figure out how to temporarily move drupal aside to 
drupal.php or /drupal/ or something where we can still easily get in and

It&#39;s the Google&#39;s open source proposal for a replacement for the  
decades old e-mail protocol, and it looked quite cool. A &#34;wave&#34; is a  
communication and collaboration unit that can be read and edited by  
multiple users in real time and easily shared to new users, unlike  
e-mail threads. It combines the functionality of instant messaging,  
wikis, conventional e-mail and social networking, and supports  
integration with external applications.

If you want invites, you can give me the e-mail addresses where you  
want them to. If you already have Wave addresses, please give me them  
as well. It would be great to see how the system works in practice.

try something besides yet another blue site.  Another line of thought is 
that it should be like a bank website, stately, professional and

The logo&#39;s a little too Disco/web-1990&#39;s.  I still like your bitweaver 
one better, I recreated it with text as a placeholder for now.  When the 
theme is more settled, I&#39;ll think about a matching logo.

Good idea about the Sourceforge tag, we can use all the graphics we can get.

I have more to do before we go live, and we need to give the search 
engines more time.

&gt; try something besides yet another blue site.  Another line of thought
&gt; is that it should be like a bank website, stately, professional and
&gt; official looking to support confidence in financial matters.
&gt;
&gt; The logo&#39;s a little too Disco/web-1990&#39;s.  I still like your bitweaver
&gt; one better, I recreated it with text as a placeholder for now.  When
&gt; the theme is more settled, I&#39;ll think about a matching logo.
&gt;
&gt; Good idea about the Sourceforge tag, we can use all the graphics we can get.
&gt;
&gt; I have more to do before we go live, and we need to give the search
&gt; engines more time.

        <pre>What Windows version/browser doesn&#39;t font anti-aliasing work on?  IE 6 
on XP anti-aliases, and versions below that have less than 1% market share.

There&#39;s a transaction fee of 0.01 per KB after the first 1KB for 
oversized transactions.  The first 1KB is free, small transactions are 
typically 250 bytes.  Doubleclick on the transaction.  Think of it like 
postage by weight.

The solution is an extra dialog when sending, something like &#34;This is an 
oversized transaction and requires a transaction fee of 0.20bc.  Is this 
OK?&#34;  (is that text good enough or any improvements?)  I have the code 
already, I&#39;ll put it in.

Then we wouldn&#39;t have to explain the 10,000.20bc transaction, but may 
still have to explain who the transaction fee goes to.

That&#39;s strange, I&#39;ve seen Firefox 3.5 on XP anti-alias large fonts. 
Well anyway, your way is safer.

I changed it back to text for now though so I can keep tweaking the 
colours.  Drupal puts the &lt;span&gt; tags and junk in the browser title but 
that&#39;s fine for testing.

I added some instruction text on the homepage below the screenshots.

&gt; Is there no transaction fee then, if you send the same amount in 
&gt; multiple small packages?

True.  I suppose the dialog could make it worse by giving people a 
chance to experiment with breaking it up.

I&#39;m making some changes.  The largest free transaction will be 60KB, or 
about 27,000bc if made of 50bc inputs.  I hope that&#39;s high enough that 
the transaction fee should rarely ever come up.  v0.2 nodes will take 
free transactions until the block size is over 200K, with priority given 
to smaller transactions.

It&#39;s best if you don&#39;t talk about this transaction fee stuff in public. 
  It&#39;s there for flood control.  We don&#39;t want to give anyone any ideas.

&gt; Where should it go btw? Here it went to the receiver along with all the 
&gt; other coins. Transaction screenshot attached.

You found an infrequent bug in CreateTransaction.  It wrote the 
transaction for 10000.20 with a fee of 0.22.  If you look at the 
transaction on the sender&#39;s side, it&#39;ll be a debit 10000.42 with 
transaction fee 0.22.  The bug was that it had to make a rare third pass 
on calculating the fee, and incorrectly added the first pass&#39; fee to the 
amount being sent.  Will fix.

No problems so far. Seems fine.

&gt; I zipped the setup exe because I doubt the e-mail servers will allow

&gt; the tar.gz one will get through.

&gt; Do you mind testing an initial block download again?

The first time I tried it on Windows, the initial download took a few  
minutes to start, even though it got many connections quickly. I tried  
again twice, and didn&#39;t have the same problem again. I don&#39;t know  
whether it&#39;s related to your latest update or not.

On Ubuntu it worked fine.

&gt; Hope this isn&#39;t in the middle of your final exams right now.

Well actually it is, but it&#39;s not too bad. Time is a matter of arrangement.

Most of the fixes are on the sender&#39;s side, so if you were downloading the network upgrades to 0.2.

        <pre>I have registered the domain name bitcoinexchange.com and will start  
coding the service sometime soon as a nice leisure activity. I&#39;m  
envisioning a simple Google-like interface with no registration and  
only two texts fields on the front page, where you insert the amount  
of money you wish to trade, and either your PayPal address to buy  
dollars or bitcoin address to buy bitcoins. On the next page you&#39;ll  
get a new bitcoin address for sending the coins or a check code for  
the PayPal transaction text.

PayPal is good for the beginning - it&#39;s simple and has no startup  
costs, but later on I might accept credit cards also.

Do you still need the maintenance account? It&#39;s ok if you do, but  
change the password to something else.

        <pre>Thanks for creating the maintenance account, it would have been 
impossible to do all that without it.  I&#39;m really always going to need 
it.  OK, I changed the password to a 20 character random password.

That&#39;s a good domain.  People rarely type domain names anymore, they use 
autocomplete or click links on search engines.

I need to make a way for you to programmatically get new generated 
bitcoin addresses.  Either that or you could have them send to your IP 
address, but then you have to rely on them to put the order number in 
the comment.

When generating the new address, there can be an option to add an entry 
to the address book associated with the address, so the received 
transaction will be labelled.  I kinda hid the labels after early users 
found them confusing, but it would be very helpful for this application. 
  You have to widen up the comment column to see them.

Are you going to manually review and enter orders, at least to begin 
with?  I sure would.

I&#39;m thinking I should move the UI in the direction of having the user 
ask for their bitcoin address when they want one.  &#34;give me a bitcoin to 
receive a payment with&#34;.  I suppose next to the send button, there would 
by a receive button, you press it and it says &#34;here&#39;s a new address to 
use, here&#39;s the button to copy it to the clipboard, do you want to label 
it?&#34; and maybe some explanation about why you shouldn&#39;t reuse addresses.

Or maybe just a &#34;New Address&#34; button next to the address box that you 
should hit each time to change it.

I&#39;d also need at least the command line tools to check if coins have  
been received and to send coins. It would require some way to  
communicate with the Bitcoin process running in the background. I  
don&#39;t know how that should be done, maybe with something RPC related.

It would also be great if the background process was non-graphical -  
the VPS on the current service level doesn&#39;t have enough memory to run  
the X Windowing environment, unless I come up with some ways to free  
memory.

Yes, at least to begin with, when the customer sells bc&#39;s and receives  
dollars. I wouldn&#39;t give a script the access to my dollar reserves so  
lightly. The other way around (customer&#39;s dollars -&gt; bitcoins) it  
doesn&#39;t feel that insecure, and it&#39;s certainly nicer for the customer  
to receive his bitcoins immediately.

I had been wondering why everyone keeps harping on no-UI, when already 
you can run it with only a small icon on the tray, which is common for 
server services on Windows.  So I guess this is why.  I had chalked it 
up to unix snobbery if they couldn&#39;t abide a tiny little icon on a 
desktop they never see.

Not opening any windows is easy, but it may fail because the gtk 
libraries aren&#39;t there.  wxWidgets has __WXBASE__ for &#34;Only wxBase, no 
GUI features&#34;.  You could try building for that instead of __WXGTK__ and 
see what happens.  It would be preferable if there&#39;s any way to do it as 
a command line switch on the same executable, rather than yet another 
build variation to release.

How much memory do you have to work with?  Bitcoin necessarily takes a 
fair bit of memory; about 75MB on Windows.  Is that a problem?

Command line control is one of the next things on the list.  I want to 
design the API carefully.

Receiving payments is the part that has a lot of design choices to be 
made.  The caller needs to identify the transactions of interest, that&#39;s 
where the one-bitcoin-address-per-transaction model helps.  Searching 
the comments text for an order number is another possibility.  There&#39;s 
polled, asking what has been received to the given bitcoin address, and 
event driven.  I guess in event driven, bitcoin would be told to run a 
command line when a certain amount is received to a certain bitcoin address.

bitcoin/bit). It&#39;s running on the Python-powered Django web  
application framework, which is a pleasure to work with, compared to  
php.

I&#39;ll have to do some studying for a few days now, after which I can  
return to work with the exchange service. Among other things I&#39;ll fix  
the pricing so that the price of Bitcoins grows towards infinity when  
my supply of them gets closer to zero. That way I can find the market  
rate and stay at the point where supply meets demand. I&#39;m not yet  
completely sure what the parameters of the hyperbolic pricing curve  
should be, so that&#39;s something to think about.

        <pre>Have you decided upon the inter-process calling method of the Bitcoin  
API yet? An easy solution would be the socket interface provided by  
wxWidgets: http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/overview_ipc.html. The  
Bitcoin program running a wxServer could be then accessed by calling  
the bitcoin executable from the command line or by coding your own  
wxClient app.

Another option would be to just use the plain BSD sockets.

Can you send me a 64-bit Linux binary of Bitcoin if you have one? I  
tried compiling on the VPS, but it ran out of memory. Tried the 32-bit  
version (with ia32-libs) also, but it didn&#39;t find the shared libraries.

        <pre>You could always exchange for Liberty Reserve.  It&#39;s an online currency 
similar to e-Bullion, Pecunix or Webmoney that allows exchanges no 
questions asked and with privacy.

LR and the others are hard to buy but easy to cash out.  Hard to buy 
because exchangers are very cautious about getting ripped off by 
reversed payments, so they require more details and holding time. 
Cashing out is very easy.  LR is non-reversible, so there are oodles of 
exchanges eager to turn LR into any kind of payment.

Bitcoin is the reverse, in that it&#39;s easy to get Bitcoins just by 
generating them.  It would be easy for customers to go 
bitcoin-&gt;LR-&gt;cash, bitcoin-&gt;LR-&gt;gold, bitcoin-&gt;LR-&gt;paypal or maybe they 
just want to save the money, then just bitcoin-&gt;LR.

There&#39;s also the idea BTC2PSC had to sell paysafecards for bitcoins. 
Either online delivery by sending the card number by e-mail, or delivery 
of the unopened physical card in the mails.  There are many variations 
of these cards.  In some countries, they&#39;re called Gift Cards, and can 
be used wherever credit cards are accepted.  I think they&#39;re used more 
by people who don&#39;t have the credit history to get a real credit card, 
so they buy gift cards themselves to pay for things that require a 
credit card.

        <pre>Don&#39;t rush ahead and get yourself rejected from all the payment options 
before you&#39;ve had time to see if there&#39;s a better approach.  I suggest 
you wait before contacting any more payment processors.  You may get 
ideas from things other users come up with and try.

Just some random incomplete ideas: There may be a way to position it as 
an intermediate credit for micropayments for some virtual good or 
something.  Or maybe if the payments are only in one direction.  If you 
only buy bitcoins, then you&#39;re only sending money out not taking 
people&#39;s money, that would still be useful to peg the currency.  That 
might be payment for computer time.

Credit card is only one way.  Don&#39;t even talk about the idea of 
returning money to customer&#39;s credit cards.  Credit card companies hate 
that.

In any case, any payment processor is going to expect you to be selling 
something real.

        <pre>Is there any way to find out what the missing shared libraries are?  It 
would help to know.

It probably needs the gtk libraries, in which case you&#39;ll have the same 
problem with the 64-bit version.  I would like to have a single 
executable that can also run on a UI-less system, but I&#39;m not sure how 
on linux to link to things but still be able to run and not use them if 
the library is not present.  Maybe we should statically link the GTK. 
Licensewise, it&#39;s LGPL, but since it&#39;s only used on unix, that would be 
OK.  (we can&#39;t link LGPL stuff on windows because we provide the OpenSSL 
DLL, but on linux OpenSSL comes with the OS)

My 64-bit (debug stripped) executable is attached.  It includes untested 
changes that are not in SVN yet: UI changes and the wallet fSpent flag 
resync stuff.

I&#39;ve been researching options for interprocess calling.  I want 
something that will be easy for a variety of server side languages to 
call, particularly PHP.  Cross-platform to windows is a plus.

I&#39;m not sure if I want it to be something that can be accessed across 
the network.  That would introduce security issues.  If it can only be 
accessed on the local system, then local security authentication covers 
it, and it is incapable of being hacked remotely.

At surface level, not looking into any details yet, the current front 
runners are:
D-Bus:
    local system only
    used by qt, gnome and skype
    bindings: c, python, java, c++,
          php listed as &#34;in progress&#34;
          .net listed as unmaintained
          not sure how ready it is on windows
XML-RPC:
    widely used, built in libraries on PHP
    it&#39;s more for web clients to talk to server, transport is http, so 
its a security question

Is it possible to open a socket that can only be accessed locally?

&gt; Is it possible to open a socket that can only be accessed locally?

Yes, you can use IPC sockets (&#34;Unix domain sockets&#34;) which are local  
only. That&#39;s done in the wx-api by using a filename in place of a port  
number. I committed an example of how the wxServer-Client  
communication is used, you can revert if you want to. Now there&#39;s the  
-blockamount command line option which asks the running instance for  
the block chain length.

I think this command line method could already be used from PHP, but  
it might be lighter if php itself could call the socket server  
directly. The wx&#39;s IPC overview mentions wxSocketEvent, wxSocketBase,  
wxSocketClient and wxSocketServer as being &#34;Classes for the low-level  
TCP/IP API&#34;, which might be easier to use from php than what I used  
now (wxServer, wxClient, wxConnection). I&#39;ll look more into it.

        <pre>Good, then no need to consider d-bus.  Is there something like IPC 
sockets on Windows?  I guess we could look how wx does it, or maybe the 
XML-RPC library will already know what to do.  Windows has named pipes, 
maybe that&#39;s the best analogue.

I don&#39;t think I want to invent my own RPC protocol, I want to use an 
existing standard.  PHP, Java, Python or anything will be able to talk 
to the server directly the same way the command line commands do.

I&#39;m going to start reading on XML-RPC.  It&#39;s coming up in searches as 
the most widely used protocol and widely supported.  PHP includes it in 
its standard libraries.

&#34;If wait is true and there are no pending connections to be accepted, it 
will wait for the next incoming connection to arrive.  **Warning: This 
will block the GUI.&#34;

wxWidgets is pathologically single-threaded.  Not only single-threaded, 
but must-be-the-GUI-thread-ed.  Even for something as non-UI as 
wxStandardPaths I got nailed.  All this is fine for UI code, since this 
is the same constraint placed by Windows anyway, but for UI-less server 
daemon code, wx calls are uncertain.

Status of my research currently:

For PHP, Python, etc to access the server, we need to use regular 
sockets.  I think we can make it local-only by binding to localhost 
only, so it can only be accessed through the loopback.  They say it&#39;s 
also watertight to simply check the IP of connections received and 
disconnect anything not 127.0.0.1.  May as well do both.

XML-RPC is a bit fat.  There are 4 libraries for C++ but they&#39;re all big 
and hard to build, dependencies, license issues.  Some posters complain 
all the C++ and PHP XML-RPC libraries are buggy.

JSON-RPC is a simpler more elegant standard.  It&#39;s simple enough I could 
use a generic JSON parser.

PHP, Python and Java all have good implementations of JSON-RPC.

I&#39;m currently leaning towards JSON-RPC.

        <pre>Liberty Reserve sounds good. I could first make a service that only  
accepts LR, and add more options later. The weakness is that buying LR  
is an extra step of inconvenience when the customer just wants to get  
Bitcoins. But maybe I don&#39;t have too much choice here.

&gt; Do you have electronic transfer or paper cheque in your country? (even
&gt; if only within Europe)

Yes, electronic bank transfer is available. During 2010 most European  
countries will become a part of SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area),  
which means that all payments within Europe are to be considered  
domestic. Banks will have to apply the same fees and standards to all  
domestic transfers, so they&#39;ll probably all be free of charge and  
complete in one bank day. For international transfers there&#39;s the  
SWIFT/IBAN system, which usually costs some extra.

A longer term project for my exchange service would be to see what  
kinds of integration options the banks have to offer. Bank transfers  
would reach nearly as many customers as credit cards do.

        <pre>Maybe the current difficulty of buying LR is already the limit of how 
easy it can get in that direction.

Every conventional payment method has refutability as their way to cope 
with their lack of passwords and crypto.  The system is wide open to 
copying plaintext credit card numbers and account numbers, and they deal 
with it by reversing the transaction after the fact.  The system works 
for physical goods that have to be delivered somewhere, and services 
which can&#39;t be resold.  It&#39;s a problem when it interfaces with precious 
metals and currency conversion.

The first step of being easy in one direction, bitcoin-&gt;LR or anything 
of established value, goes a long way.  Even those who don&#39;t use the 
conversion still benefit from knowing that they could.  Trading bitcoin 
becomes an easier way to trade the ability to claim LR, similar to how 
paper money was once the right to claim gold.  Nobody has to ever 
actually claim the LR to get the benefit of having the option that they 
could if they wanted to.

A lot of times you just need a minuscule amount of online currency.  The 
hassle of buying the other online currencies is too much for buying a 
small amount.  The ease of getting a small amount of bitcoin may help 
bootstrap an ecosystem of sellers of micropayment sized online goods 
selling to that market.  If the sellers can get LR for bitcoins, they&#39;re 
happy, and that may be subsidized at first by investors who want to buy 
bc in large lots.

The main thing holding online currencies back is the lack of an easy way 
to get a small amount of currency.  Bitcoin opens that up.  It&#39;ll be the 
only online currency that&#39;s both easy to cash out and easy to get a 
small amount.  It&#39;ll just be the usual harder difficulty to buy a large 
amount.

You might find it preferable not to translate it into your own language. 
  Often the standard answer about legalities is that it&#39;s only intended 
for people in other countries.  Translating it into your home language 
weakens that argument.

waiting to post on the forum when I&#39;ve had more time to think about the 
commands.  At least some method names are going to change.

To enable the RPC server, add the switch -server.  It&#39;s not on by default.

Client commands are without any switches, as such:
bitcoin getblockcount
bitcoin getdifficulty
bitcoin getnewaddress somelabel
bitcoin sendtoaddress 1DvqsbZ... 1.00
bitcoin getallpayments 0
bitcoin stop

Applications would normally use JSON-RPC directly, not command line.

I haven&#39;t tested my JSON-RPC server with anything else yet.  If you do, 
please tell me how it goes.  You&#39;re using Python, right?

Getting the Linux version to run without the GTK installed will be a 
separate task.

Yes, using Python. I didn&#39;t test the JSON-RPC yet as I don&#39;t have

Good, that gives them a little sense of ownership and responsibility.

I hope we get at least one .mo file for the software translation in time 
to put into the 0.3 release.

        <pre>I put it at bitcoin.org/download/linux64-0.2.7.1.tar.gz.  You can delete 
it when you&#39;ve got it.

I thought about what might cause the problem you&#39;re having and made a 
change that this build includes.  This might have been unsafe code, 
although it would probably always get lucky.

in util.cpp, old:
const char* wxGetTranslation(const char* pszEnglish)
{
     // Wrapper of wxGetTranslation returning the same const char* type 
as was passed in
     static CCriticalSection cs;
     CRITICAL_BLOCK(cs)
     {
         // Look in cache
         static map&lt;string, char*&gt; mapCache;
         map&lt;string, char*&gt;::iterator mi = mapCache.find(pszEnglish);
         if (mi != mapCache.end())
             return (*mi).second;

         // wxWidgets translation
         const char* pszTranslated = 
wxGetTranslation(wxString(pszEnglish, wxConvUTF8)).utf8_str();

         // We don&#39;t cache unknown strings because caller might be 
passing in a
         // dynamic string and we would keep allocating memory for each 
variation.
         if (strcmp(pszEnglish, pszTranslated) == 0)
             return pszEnglish;

         // Add to cache, memory doesn&#39;t need to be freed.  We only 
cache because
         // we must pass back a pointer to permanently allocated memory.
         char* pszCached = new char[strlen(pszTranslated)+1];
         strcpy(pszCached, pszTranslated);
         mapCache[pszEnglish] = pszCached;
         return pszCached;
     }
     return NULL;
}

new:
const char* wxGetTranslation(const char* pszEnglish)
{
     // Wrapper of wxGetTranslation returning the same const char* type 
as was passed in
     static CCriticalSection cs;
     CRITICAL_BLOCK(cs)
     {
         // Look in cache
         static map&lt;string, char*&gt; mapCache;
         map&lt;string, char*&gt;::iterator mi = mapCache.find(pszEnglish);
         if (mi != mapCache.end())
             return (*mi).second;

         // wxWidgets translation
         wxString strTranslated = wxGetTranslation(wxString(pszEnglish, 
wxConvUTF8));

         // We don&#39;t cache unknown strings because caller might be 
passing in a
         // dynamic string and we would keep allocating memory for each 
variation.
         if (strcmp(pszEnglish, strTranslated.utf8_str()) == 0)
             return pszEnglish;

         // Add to cache, memory doesn&#39;t need to be freed.  We only 
cache because
         // we must pass back a pointer to permanently allocated memory.
         char* pszCached = new char[strlen(strTranslated.utf8_str())+1];
         strcpy(pszCached, strTranslated.utf8_str());
         mapCache[pszEnglish] = pszCached;
         return pszCached;
     }
     return NULL;
}

If you still suspect this code, for testing you could change it to:
const char* wxGetTranslation(const char* pszEnglish)
{
     return pszEnglish;
}

You could comment out the CreateThreads listed below, then re-enable 
them one at a time until it does it again.  Then we would know which 
thread the problem is in.

net.cpp, under // Start threads
     CreateThread(ThreadIRCSeed, NULL)

     CreateThread(ThreadOpenConnections, NULL)

Or you could run it in gdb and step through ThreadIRCSeed

program started eating memory after the debug line &#34;irc 8&#34; and within  
a few seconds crashed with &#34;terminate called after throwing an  
instance of &#39;std::bad_alloc&#39;&#34;.

&gt; It&#39;s in RecvUntil, but I still can&#39;t see anything wrong with it.  The
&gt; only thing I can think of is if the socket is receiving a spew of
&gt; characters.
&gt;
&gt; Try this irc.cpp.  debug.log may grow rapidly so be ready to kill it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Eyeballing it I don&#39;t see anything obvious.  I guess it would have to
&gt;&gt;&gt; be either in ConnectSocket or RecvUntil.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Try it with the attached irc.cpp and net.cpp and send me the debug.log.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Or you could run it in gdb and step through ThreadIRCSeed

        <pre>It&#39;s in util.c ParseString.  I&#39;m guessing the problem is incompatibility 
between the type &#34;unsigned int&#34; and the type of str.npos, which is 
size_type.

Try changing the two &#34;unsigned int&#34;s to &#34;size_type&#34;.

     unsigned int i1 = 0;

         v.push_back(str.substr(i1, i2-i1));
         i1 = i2+1;
     }
     while (i2 != str.npos);
}

new:
void ParseString(const string&amp; str, char c, vector&lt;string&gt;&amp; v)

     size_type i2;

        <pre>I confirmed that ParseString has this problem, and uploaded the fixed 
util.cpp to SVN.

string::npos == -1

Comparing unsigned int -1 (0xffffffff) with long unsigned int -1 
(0xffffffffffffffff) results in the unsigned int being promoted to 
64-bit, which is 0x00000000ffffffff != 0xffffffffffffffff.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That narrows it down a lot.  It didn&#39;t print any IRC activity in

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Eyeballing it I don&#39;t see anything obvious.  I guess it would have to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be either in ConnectSocket or RecvUntil.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Try it with the attached irc.cpp and net.cpp and send me the debug.log.

        <pre>Hi!

How are you doing? Haven&#39;t seen you around in a while.

I&#39;ve been at full-time work lately, and will be until the end of June,  
so I haven&#39;t had that much time to work with Bitcoin or my exchange  
service. I have a working beta of my service though, and a few weeks  
ago made my first transaction: sold 10,000 btc for 20 euros via EU  
bank transfer. Maybe I can make it public soon.

I divided the forum into 6 boards, which are Bitcoin Discussion,  
Development &amp; Technical Discussion, Technical support, Economics,  
Marketplace and Trading Discussion. Hope this is ok?

I also added a page &#34;Trade&#34; on the bitcoin.org site, where  
btc-accepting services are listed. It&#39;s nice to see that there are  
already useful services that accept btc.

The community has been growing nicely. We&#39;ve had around 10-20 people  
and active discussion at #bitcoin-dev lately.

It would be nice to get the daemon-able binaries to SF.net. We have  
some skilled programmers in the community now, so maybe we can finish  
the JSON API functions if you don&#39;t have time to.

Best regards.

        <pre>I&#39;ve also been busy with other things for the last month and a half.  I 
just now downloaded my e-mail since the beginning of April.  I mostly 
have things sorted and should be back to Bitcoin shortly.  Glad that 
you&#39;ve been handling things in my absence.  Congrats on your first 
transaction!

As I recall, the code was nearly ready for a 0.3 release.  I think all 
it needed was a little testing time and to install the new icon xpm.

The JSON API functions are complete.  I wanted to take another fresh 
look at them in case I think of any better function names before 
committing.  I ought to write some sample code showing the proper way to 
use them, particularly with polling for received transactions.  When I 
left off, I was thinking about bolting a payment mechanism onto a free 
upload server software as an example.  It would make sense to actually 
build one practical application with the API before releasing it.  You 
don&#39;t realise the problems with an API until you actually try to use it.

Ok, I&#39;ll monitor it. Bandwidth hasn&#39;t been a problem so far - it&#39;s  
been about 2 GB (0.5 dollars) per month at most. Other costs are about  
15$ a month.

        <pre>I think we should de-emphasize the anonymous angle.  With the popularity 
of bitcoin addresses instead of sending by IP, we can&#39;t give the 
impression it&#39;s automatically anonymous.  It&#39;s possible to be 
pseudonymous, but you have to be careful.  If someone digs through the 
transaction history and starts exposing information people thought was 
anonymous, the backlash will be much worse if we haven&#39;t prepared 
expectations by warning in advance that you have to take precautions if 
you really want to make that work.  Like Tor says, &#34;Tor does not 
magically encrypt all of your Internet activities.  Understand what Tor 
does and does not do for you.&#34;

Also, anonymous sounds a bit shady.  I think the people who want 
anonymous will still figure it out without us trumpeting it.

I made some changes to the bitcoin.org homepage.  It&#39;s not really 
crucial to update the translations.  I tend to keep editing and 
correcting for some time afterwards, so if they want to update, they 
should wait.

I removed the word &#34;anonymous&#34;, and the sentence about &#34;anonymity 
means&#34;, although you worded it so carefully &#34;...CAN be kept hidden...&#34; 
it was a shame to remove it.

Instead, I added Tor instructions at the bottom, with instructions for 
how to stay anonymous (pseudonymous) directly after the Tor 
instructions: &#34;If you want to remain anonymous (pseudonymous, really), 
be careful not to reveal any information linking your bitcoin addresses 
to your identity, and use a new bitcoin address for each payment you 
receive.&#34;

It helps that it can now seed automatically through Tor.

Even though it doesn&#39;t say anonymous until the bottom, I think anonymous 
seekers would already suspect it based on all the other attributes like 
no central authority to take your ID info and the way bitcoin addresses 
look.

Announcing version 0.3 of Bitcoin, the P2P cryptocurrency!  Bitcoin is a 
digital currency using cryptography and a distributed network to replace 
the need for a trusted central server.  Escape the arbitrary inflation 
risk of centrally managed currencies!  Bitcoin&#39;s total circulation is 
limited to 21 million coins.  The coins are gradually being released to 
the networks nodes based on the CPU power they contribute.  You can get 
a share of them just by installing the software and contributing your 
idle CPU time.

What&#39;s new:
- Command line and JSON-RPC control
- Includes a daemon version without GUI
- Tabs for sent and received transactions
- 20% faster hashing
- Hashmeter performance display
- Mac OS X version (thanks to Laszlo)
- German, Dutch and Italian translations (thanks to DataWraith, Xunie 
and Joozero)

immature if it doesn&#39;t have that already.  &#34;Transaction filter tabs&#34; 
sounds better.

I&#39;m still editing it a little more and then I&#39;ll e-mail it to 
bitcoin-list and send it to the cryptography list.

It was an old FAQ on sourceforge that had been linked from slashdot (on a
highly visible comment). people were going there because bitcoin.org was 
down
for a while.

http://bitcoin.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php?page=FAQ

Probably not an issue anymore, but might be a good idea to delete or update
that wiki page.

&gt; I don&#39;t see any 0.1.5 download links on the FAQ.  Do you mean
&gt; bitcoin.org/faq?  Is it on one of the other languages?  Or maybe someone
&gt; else fixed it already.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyways, I write to you now to let you know you must update the FAQ
&gt; &gt; immediately. It points to 0.15 of bitcoin for download. You must update
&gt; &gt; it to 0.30, as it is slashdotted!

Hi,

In the FAQ of bitcoin.org &lt;http://bitcoin.org&gt; the backing up of the
wallet had old instructions, right?  Should it just be to back up
wallat.dat instead of the entire folder???  See below.


&#34;How do I backup my wallet?

Your data is stored in the directory &#39;&#39;%appdata%\Bitcoin&#39;&#39;, which is
typically:

  Windows XP:
    C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Bitcoin
  Windows Vista:
    C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin

It’s recommended that you stop Bitcoin before backing it up to make sure
the backup will be correct.&#34;

        <pre>You did some research when choosing hosting, this was a well chosen one, 
right?  It seems like it would be a tremendous hassle to change, and 
we&#39;ve had good luck with this one.  Cheaper will usually have some 
offsetting drawback in quality.

I wonder if that extra memory is just disk cache or something.

I take it you haven&#39;t received anything from that donor yet?  He seemed 
pretty certain he was going to send it, maybe more.  (if you get 
anything, we need to keep private for him the fact that we got a donation)

        <pre>Yes, we could give accounts to trusted translators. I haven&#39;t found a  
way to give them edit permissions to only one page, but they can be  
forced to create a new revision with every page change they make, and  
not be allowed to delete revisions. Xunie would be the first on the  
list I&#39;d give an account. :)

Hi Sirius,

Check out www.citrusdesignstudio.com. You will see through the portfolio that
I am a real business with many clients.

That is my business that I provide managed hosting through.
I also do unmanaged VPSes.

Normally I would charge $15/mo for 512MB.
I will do it for $10/mo for you.

To see my pricing, go to www.linnode.com. I match everything they have except
their great panel -- you have to email or call my people.

I provide VPS services normally for 3/4ths the posted cost on linnode.com.
(Rackspace is even more expensive.)

I will do it for 1/2 of linnode&#39;s price for you.

It scales linerally just like linnodes, so for 2048 MB of memory, I would
charge $40, etc.

Later!
-----

That would be worth considering, if they have good datacenters and  
connections. $10 / month is about $20 less than what Rackspace costs.  
On the other hand, Rackspace prices are no problem if the donation is  
to arrive.

I will try to think of a polite way to ask the donor if he sent it, but 
right now there are other higher priority things that are going to bump

Would a donation of bitcoins help in the short term?

That&#39;s great!  I&#39;ll let him know it was received and thank him.

It might be a long time before we get another donation like that, we 
should save a lot of it.

Spend what you need on hosting.  Email me a simple accounting when you 
take out money for expenses, like:
    -$60 rackspace monthly
   $2540 balance

$100-200 is chump change if they&#39;re a serious company, it would only 
make us sound small.

What they need most is confidence they can convert it to fiat currency. 
  That VOIP company essentially said so in a recent post.  The best 
thing we can do is make sure there&#39;s cash available to cash out and 
support and steady the conversion rate.

The money is leveraged better that way too.  Theoretically, imagine 10 
businesses have their eye on a $100 bill being offered for bitcoins, but 
don&#39;t actually cash out because they know it&#39;s there if they need it. 
That one $100 bill allowed 10 different people to act like their 5000 
bitcoins were equivalent to $100.

I think we should allocate $1000 at this point to your exchange.

Alright, I&#39;ll add $1000 dollars to the exchange reserves. That way I  
can offer more stable pricing.

A week ago somebody bought coins with 1000 €. That was probably meant  
as a donation to some extent, since 1000 € would have bought him a lot  
more coins at bitcoinmarket.com than at my service.

About +1000€ (plus the $1000) and -40000 BTC since when I started. I

&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Looks like bitcoin.org is listed on the PBL.&#34;
&gt; http://www.spamhaus.org/pbl/query/PBL340779

I think our problem may be that we have forum notifications on, like 
e-mail you when you receive a PM, but we don&#39;t have e-mail verification 
of new accounts.  Can someone put someone else&#39;s e-mail address without 
verifying it, then have stuff sent there?  We need to stop that right 
away before it gets used for something bad.  Either disallow all 
notification, or make sure e-mail addresses are verified.

I&#39;m more inclined to disallow notifications or anything where the forum 
sends you e-mail.  I kinda like not requiring e-mail verification.  But 
if that&#39;s the only way to make sure we don&#39;t send e-mails to un-verified 
addresses, then we could do that.

If we request to get off of PBL, we&#39;d better make sure we&#39;ve got the 
problem secured first.

I changed Registration-&gt;settings-&gt;registration of new members to &#34;Member 
Activation&#34;.  I assume that means it e-mail verifies.
&#34;Member Activation
When this option is enabled any members registering to the forum will 
have a activation link emailed to them which they must click before they 
can become full members&#34;

I think that&#39;s the only way to make sure the forum can&#39;t be used to send 
to other people&#39;s e-mail addresses and potentially use it to spam.

We probably got spam blocked because we were allowing registrations 
without e-mail verification.  But now that we&#39;ve enabled it, our 
verification e-mails are blocked.

There could still be some existing user accounts created before the 
registration requirement being used by spammers.

We&#39;re kind of in a jam here.  Can you make sure there&#39;s nothing else you 
can think of that might be acting as an open e-mail gateway or way for 
spammers to use our system for putting out spam?  Check the e-mail logs 
and see if there&#39;s been a lot of traffic and what it&#39;s from.  If you can 
figure out what the problem was and shut it down, then after you&#39;re sure 
it&#39;s fixed, request PBL to take us off the block list.

If there&#39;s a way to prohibit the forum from sending e-mail 
notifications, maybe we should do that.

I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a notification option for when you receive PMs,

Subject: Forum e-mail notifications and PBL blacklist and wiki registration

http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=338.0

&gt; of e-mail blackhole list or at least the ISP that hosts the e-mail server for registration is on one of those lists.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Looks like bitcoin.org is listed on the PBL.&#34;
&gt; http://www.spamhaus.org/pbl/query/PBL340779

I think our problem may be that we have forum notifications on, like
e-mail you when you receive a PM, but we don&#39;t have e-mail verification
of new accounts.  Can someone put someone else&#39;s e-mail address without
verifying it, then have stuff sent there?  We need to stop that right
away before it gets used for something bad.  Either disallow all
notification, or make sure e-mail addresses are verified.

I&#39;m more inclined to disallow notifications or anything where the forum
sends you e-mail.  I kinda like not requiring e-mail verification.  But
if that&#39;s the only way to make sure we don&#39;t send e-mails to un-verified
addresses, then we could do that.

If we request to get off of PBL, we&#39;d better make sure we&#39;ve got the
problem secured first.

I changed Registration-&gt;settings-&gt;registration of new members to &#34;Member
Activation&#34;.  I assume that means it e-mail verifies.
&#34;Member Activation
When this option is enabled any members registering to the forum will
have a activation link emailed to them which they must click before they
can become full members&#34;

I think that&#39;s the only way to make sure the forum can&#39;t be used to send
to other people&#39;s e-mail addresses and potentially use it to spam.

</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="email-224">
      
      
      <div>
        <pre>The logs don&#39;t tell very much, they just confirm that many servers  
reject the emails sent by our server. I can&#39;t think of anything other  
than pm notifications that could have caused the spam listing. I&#39;ll  
check if I can disable the notifications from the code.

We can allow registrations without email confirmation. It&#39;s no problem  
when we&#39;re already on the spam list and no problem after the  
notifications are disabled.

&gt; Oh great, now we&#39;re screwed.
&gt;
&gt; We probably got spam blocked because we were allowing registrations
&gt; without e-mail verification.  But now that we&#39;ve enabled it, our
&gt; verification e-mails are blocked.
&gt;
&gt; There could still be some existing user accounts created before the
&gt; registration requirement being used by spammers.
&gt;
&gt; We&#39;re kind of in a jam here.  Can you make sure there&#39;s nothing else
&gt; you can think of that might be acting as an open e-mail gateway or way
&gt; for spammers to use our system for putting out spam?  Check the e-mail
&gt; logs and see if there&#39;s been a lot of traffic and what it&#39;s from.  If
&gt; you can figure out what the problem was and shut it down, then after
&gt; you&#39;re sure it&#39;s fixed, request PBL to take us off the block list.
&gt;
&gt; If there&#39;s a way to prohibit the forum from sending e-mail
&gt; notifications, maybe we should do that.

&gt;
&gt; I tried to register me at the bitcoinforum, but I didn&#39;t get an activation

&gt; Tried the resend activation code option a few times, changed the

The FAQ says: &#34;The first thing to know is: THE PBL IS NOT A BLACKLIST.  
You are not listed for spamming or for anything you have done. The PBL  
is simply a list of all of the world&#39;s dynamic IP space, i.e: IP  
ranges normally assigned to ISP broadband customers (DSL, DHCP, PPP,  
cable, dialup). It is perfectly normal for dynamic IP addresses to be  
listed on the PBL. In fact all dynamic IP addresses in the world  
should be on the PBL. Even static IPs which do not send mail should be  
listed in the PBL.&#34; So we didn&#39;t even need to allow spam to be on the  
list.

http://apps.facebook.com/sweepmines/ now accepts BitCoins.

This is single-player computer game based on Windows Minesweeper version.

Would you be so kind to add us to the http://www.bitcoin.org/trade page?

Thank you.

        <pre>I reuploaded the changes.  For future reference, the files in Sources 
with customisations are:
Register.php
PersonalMessage.php
ManageRegistration.php
Subs.php

Let me know whenever you do an upgrade so I can make sure all my changes 
survived.

Hopefully the 1.1.x line is mature and updates are infrequent.  We 
shouldn&#39;t upgrade to 2.0.  I made a ton of customisations that wouldn&#39;t 
be compatible, and I kind of prefer the look of 1.1 over 2.0 anyway.

The captcha url has mycode=4 added to it, and the register page has 
extra hidden mycode=2 through 5 images so any automated thing wouldn&#39;t 
know which one to pick.  Everything that uses captcha has to have that 
mycode=4 thing added.  Something in sending personal messages also uses 
captcha.

I don&#39;t know what it was. It started working again when I rebooted it.  
Someone suggested it might have been the heavy load from a Reddit post  
about Bitcoin. Inspecting the logs would be useful, but I don&#39;t have  
much time now.

I told him to go ahead. I don&#39;t do automatic backups atm. We should  
have more server admins soon when I get bitcoinexchange.com to another  
server. I could give the root password to you and somebody else. Xunie  
has volunteered, but we might find somebody even more professional  outage was due to heavy load, he could help us move to lighttpd or  
optimize resources otherwise. Should we make a recruitment thread on

It should be Gavin.  I trust him, he&#39;s responsible, professional, and

memory error and mysqld got killed. It was the same error last time,  
but with apache getting killed. I couldn&#39;t think of anything better,  
so I resized the server from 512MB to 1024MB of memory.

Should we go by it and trust the database along with its password

option is to encrypt the backups with pgp and store them in multiple

&gt; 
&gt; That seems like asking for trouble, and I think it would violate the
&gt; implicit trust of everybody who&#39;s registered for the forums.

I agree, don&#39;t let the database out of your hands.  There&#39;s private PM 
in there, e-mail addresses, passwords.

BTW, password hashes = passwords.  It&#39;s easy to break the hash of short 
passwords people use on forums.
6 chars = 3 difficulty
7 chars = 410 difficulty
8 chars = 25418 difficulty


&gt;&gt; Another option is to
&gt;&gt; &gt; encrypt the backups with pgp and store them in multiple places.
&gt; 
&gt; That seems wiser.  Daily backups copied ... somewhere ... seems like
&gt; the right thing to do.  If they&#39;re reasonably small (less than a
&gt; gigabyte), I&#39;d be happy to pay for Amazon S3 storage/bandwidth for
&gt; them.

Even with encryption, a trusted storage place is better.

Great

&gt; Satoshi, I assume you don&#39;t want to

True

&gt; We could decline to talk to the press-- Satoshi, I know you&#39;ve
&gt; expressed concern about bitcoin growing too big too fast, and being
&gt; unable to keep up with traffic/attacks/feature requests/etc.  But I
&gt; don&#39;t think ignoring the press will make them go away; they&#39;ll just
&gt; talk to somebody else.  I think it is better to give a realistic
&gt; impression of bitcoin (it is cutting-edge, beta software that is still
&gt; being developed, it is not poised to replace PayPal or the Euro
&gt; anytime soon, etc) rather than let somebody over-enthusiastic become
&gt; &#34;the unofficial bitcoin spokesperson.&#34;

You&#39;re the best person to do it.

EFF is really important.  We want to have a good relationship with them. 
  We&#39;re the type of project they like; they&#39;ve helped the TOR project 
and done a lot to protect P2P file sharing.

&gt; Mr. Mark Herpel of Digital Gold Currency Magazine brought Bitcoin to my 
&gt; attention for inclusion in my thesis. The thesis working title is: 
&gt; Digital Currency Systems: Emerging B2B e-Commerce Alternative During 
&gt; Monetary Crisis in the United States. I discuss the five types of 
&gt; systems per Mr. Herpels suggestion.
&gt; 
&gt; Appreciate it and hope to talk soon.

Since I&#39;m no longer maintaining bitcoinexchange.com, I&#39;m returning the  
750€ to the project budget. I&#39;ll do this when I get a payment from the  
SMS gateway provider.

        <pre>Looks like an excellent opportunity to reach an important audience  
that doesn&#39;t follow Slashdot or Reddit. I&#39;d recommend this job for  
Gavin or Bruce Wagner. Or maybe there can be two attendees. S3052 from  
the forum also seemed potentially competent.

Gavin, would you be interested in organizing this?

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I am writing you on behalf of the EPCA Conference because we are   
&gt; interested to learn more about Bitcoin. Possibly Bitcoin is an   
&gt; interesting topic for the upcoming conference 4-6 April in Amsterdam.
&gt;
&gt; At this top rated conference we deal with the key strategic   
&gt; developments in the &#39;transaction industry&#39; so not limited to   
&gt; payments. The event is truly &#39;professional for professional&#39;, so   
&gt; every presentation is screened on quality and relevance (no sales   
&gt; pitches). See also:   
&gt; www.epcaconference.com&lt;http://www.epcaconference.com&gt; .
&gt;
&gt; Since we discuss the most relevant topics in the industry, I would   
&gt; like to investigate whether the Bitcoin paradigm is interesting for   
&gt; the attendees. This should give the attendees (bankers and other   
&gt; financial professionals) a lot of inspiration for their own   
&gt; business. At the same time it is a good opportunity to position   
&gt; Bitcoin within the international audience, to gain unique strategic   
&gt; insights and to network within the European professional scene.
&gt;
&gt; Can we have contact this week to elaborate this further? Thank you   
&gt; in advance,
&gt;
&gt; Look forward hearing from you,
&gt;
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; Douwe Lycklama
&gt; EPCA Conference Chaiman

        <pre>Hello,

Thanks for contacting and sorry for the late response. EPCA seems very  
interesting for the Bitcoin project, a good opportunity for  
networking. I&#39;ll find somebody who can work with you on this. In the  
meantime please ask me for any questions.

Best regards,

Martti Malmi
Bitcoin project developer

        <pre>&gt; I have not sent a message to the sourceforge bitcoin-list mailing list
&gt; because I don&#39;t think I have permission; Satoshi, can you give me
&gt; permission, encrypt the mailman password with my public key and send
&gt; it to me, or just post the announcement?

Martti should give you the Drupal admin password.

Any subscriber can post to bitcoin-list.  Here&#39;s the admin password in 
case you need it later.
