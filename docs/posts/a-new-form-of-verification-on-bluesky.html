<p>Trust is everything. Social media has connected us in powerful ways, but it hasn’t always given us the tools to know who we’re interacting with or why we should trust them.</p>
<p>In 2023, we launched our first layer of verification: letting individuals and organizations <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">set their domain as their username</a>. Since then, over 270,000 accounts have linked their Bluesky username to their website. Domain handles continue to be an important part of verification on Bluesky. At the same time, we&#39;ve heard from users that a larger visual signal would be useful in knowing which accounts are authentic.</p>
<p><strong>Now, we’re introducing a new layer — a user-friendly, easily recognizable blue check</strong>. Bluesky will proactively verify authentic and notable accounts and display a blue check next to their names. Additionally, <strong>through our Trusted Verifiers feature, select independent organizations can verify accounts directly</strong>. Bluesky will review these verifications as well to ensure authenticity.</p>

<h2>Trusted Verifiers</h2>
<p>Blue checks issued by platforms are just one form of trust. But trust doesn’t come only from the top down; it emerges from relationships, communities, and shared context.</p>
<p>So, we’re also enabling <strong>trusted verifiers</strong>: organizations that can directly issue blue checks. Trusted verifiers are marked by scalloped blue checks, as shown below.</p>

<p>For example, the New York Times can now issue blue checks to its journalists directly in the app. Bluesky’s moderation team reviews each verification to ensure authenticity.</p>
<p>When you tap on a verified account&#39;s blue check, you’ll see which organizations have granted verification.</p>

<p>You can also choose to hide verification within the app — navigate to Settings &gt; Moderation &gt; Verification Settings to toggle it off.</p>
<h2>How to Get Verified on Bluesky</h2>
<p>You can self-verify by <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">setting your domain as your username</a>. We highly encourage official organizations and individuals to do this.</p>
<p>During this initial phase, Bluesky is not accepting direct applications for verification. As this feature stabilizes, we’ll launch a request form for notable and authentic accounts interested in becoming verified or becoming trusted verifiers.</p></div></section></div>
