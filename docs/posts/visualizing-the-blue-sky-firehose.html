    <h1>Visualizing the Blue Sky Firehose</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="observablehq-main">

<p>I unfortunately missed the heyday of the Twitter API, but I&#39;d seen a few posts about Jetstream from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/20/bluesky-websocket-firehose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon Willison</a> and <a href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/drinking-from-the-bluesky-firehose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake Lazaroff</a>, and wanted to do a quick hack visualization with d3, based on <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this template visualization</a>.</p>
<p>This was super easy to put together (thanks to the aforementioned blog posts!)</p>
<p>This visualization provides a live stream of hashtag frequency from the moment you connect, but also includes a decay rate so that stale hashtags are removed after a certain period of inactivity.</p>
<p>The value on the bar is the total number of times the hashtag has appeared since connecting to the stream (and the hashtag is hyperlinked to search in <a href="https://bsky.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Sky</a>. The length of the bar includes the decay rate value. The plot itself is updated every 5 seconds.</p>
<p>(Also it should go without saying, but potential NSFW hashtags will appear. It is the unfiltered internet, after all...)</p>
