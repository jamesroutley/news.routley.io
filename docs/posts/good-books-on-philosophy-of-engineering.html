    <h1>Ask HN: Good books on philosophy of engineering?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am a software engineer by passion. I love computers, I am curious. I love to learn new things / concepts. I love to see the beauty in existing concepts being applied in completely unexpected ways, which makes you wonder that every boring thing has myriad of variations which are not obvious.</p><p>Through my college education &amp; industry experience &amp; curiosity, I have learned a lot. But, even after trying to search about books on the philosophy of engineering or the art / craft of engineering - I have fallen short.</p><p>I would love to hear what books / and projects that you have seen that have inspired you as an engineer &amp; have provided you with your own philosophy of engineering.</p><p>I am talking about general &#34;engineering&#34; here, not just specifically &#34;software engineering&#34;.</p><p>Requesting the universe to enlighten me :)</p></div></div></div>
