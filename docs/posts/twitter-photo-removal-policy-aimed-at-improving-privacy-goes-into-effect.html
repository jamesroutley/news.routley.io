        <p>Twitter will no longer let its users publish private videos or images of other people without their consent, in a new policy expansion meant to prevent harassment and abuse on its platform. </p><p>&#34;Sharing personal media, such as images or videos, can potentially violate a person&#39;s privacy, and may lead to emotional or physical harm,&#34; Twitter said <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/private-information-policy-update">in a blog post</a> on Tuesday, when the change went into effect. &#34;The misuse of private media can affect everyone, but can have a disproportionate effect on women, activists, dissidents, and members of minority communities.&#34;</p>

The <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1465738081122676736?s=20">social media company assured users</a> that &#34;context matters,&#34; and that its private information policy &#34;includes many exceptions in order to enable robust reporting on newsworthy events and conversations that are in the public interest.&#34;</p><p>Brooking added that a lot hinges on those last two words.</p><h3>Critics say the policy lets Twitter decide what&#39;s newsworthy</h3><p><a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1465738078220288000?s=20">Twitter said</a> that media showing people participating in public events, including large-scale protests and sports games, are generally allowed under the policy.</p><p>That clarification doesn&#39;t assuage Ford Fischer, a documentarian who regularly films political activism and protests around the country. He says the policy&#39;s vague terms could allow law enforcement to evade accountability.</p><p>&#34;It puts it into the hands of Twitter to have discretion,&#34; Fischer tells NPR. &#34;I don&#39;t like the idea of journalism being sort of an exception that can be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis. I think there should probably be a presumption of, you know, it is right and proper to film things in public places.&#34;</p>
