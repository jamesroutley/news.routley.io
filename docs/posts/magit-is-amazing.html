            I was reading a post about Jujutsu version control system the other day and that just made me realize how awesome is Magit!

        <p>I‚Äôve been hearing a lot about <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jujutsu</a>
 VCS lately, and when I say a lot I mean maybe 5 times this year. But that is a lot for a new VCS I would say.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/switch-to-jujutsu-already-a-tutorial/?utm_source=changelog-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>
 I came across mostly goes through the flexibility of Jujutsu VCS over <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git</a>
, or at least that‚Äôs as far as I managed to read before I lost interest. I was thinking ‚Äú<em>you can easily do this using Git???</em>‚Äù, but then I realized that I‚Äôve actually never used Git for almost anything besides cloning repositories‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always been using <a href="https://magit.vc" title="Magit! ü™Ñ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magit</a>
 for almost everything.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think whether it would have been better if I started using Git CLI and then switched to Magit, that way I would really understand why it‚Äôs called that way, rather than taking all the amazing work behind it for granted. But I think afterall I wouldn‚Äôt have discovered Git commands so early in my career if I had just used the Git CLI from the start. I remember I was stashing my code changes back in my early career while other coworkers were struggling to move to another branch without losing their changes.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm pretty sure this isn‚Äôt all what Jujutsu is about, but now I really don‚Äôt feel like giving it a try anytime soon because of that article.</p>
