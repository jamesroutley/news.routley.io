    <h1>Developing inside a virtual machine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <article>  <p> Last year, I started a new job at <a href="https://speakeasy.com/"> Speakeasy </a> and with every new job and fresh laptop is an opportunity to revise my workflow. In the past, I experienced first hand how much a development machine can get bogged down when it’s riddled with hundreds of services and homebrew packages and dependencies. All of it contributing to multiple possible attack vectors too. </p>
<p> At Speakeasy, we build code generation for SDKs in multiple languages. At the outset, I knew I needed to install multiple language toolchains and different versions of each as well as countless dependencies. This gave me the necessary nudge to try a new approach for managing my development. </p>
<p> For some time, I had known about Mitchell Hashimoto’s setup in which he works in a VM on his MacBook. I have been working with a similar setup for over a year now and it’s been a fantastic experience. </p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I switched my primary dev environment to a graphical NixOS VM on a macOS host. It has been wonderful. I can keep the great GUI ecosystem of macOS, but all dev tools are in a full screen VM. One person said “it basically replaced your terminal app” which is exactly how it feels.</p>— Mitchell Hashimoto (@mitchellh) <a href="https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1346136404682625024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2021</a></blockquote>


<p> My physical machine is a 2023 MacBook Pro with M2 Pro CPU and 32GB of RAM. I wish I went higher on RAM because it would let me run more powerful LLMs locally. </p>
<p> For my virtual machine runner, I’m using VMWare Fusion Pro. It’s practically invisible technology which is the highest praise I can give a piece of software. I don’t know if I’m paying a VM performance tax. It really never feels like it’s the case and I’ve compared build times with colleagues on the same spec machine. </p>
<p> I use Ubuntu 24.04 (arm64 build) as my guest operating system. Quite often I’ve found developers frowning up Ubuntu and preaching for folks to use NixOS, Arch, Debian or other distros. The reality for me was Ubuntu was the fastest way to get set up and now, in the steady state, it’s fallen into the background much like VMWare. I don’t think about it at all. </p>
<p> On the host (macOS), I do not use homebrew or have any other package managers. I simply use iTerm2 to SSH into the development VM and Visual Studio Code for my editor. The remote development extension for VS Code in particular is an incredible feature. <strong>All my editor extensions are installed inside the VM</strong> instead of the host machine. The exceptions being the color scheme I use and the remote extension itself which live on the host alongside the editor. </p>

<p> Going back to iTerm2, I use the tmux integration which maps windows and pans to the native GUI. It’s such a smooth experience to working with tmux using keyboard shortcuts I’m familiar with (⌘T for new tabs and ⌘D / ⌘⇧D for horizontal / vertical splits). </p>

<p> I think it’s also worth talking about my Git / GitHub workflow. I use an SSH key to authenticate with GitHub and to sign my commits. My private key does not live directly on my host or my guest OS. Instead, it lives in 1Password and is only accessible using my master password or TouchID. What’s super convenient is that I can access the key from within the VM using 1Password’s SSH agent. So any time I <code>git fetch</code> or <code>git commit</code> I get the native 1Password GUI to unlock and grant access to the key. </p>

<div> <dialog> <div>  <p><img src="https://blog.disintegrator.dev/_astro/1password-ssh.IP7v-yeA.png" alt="Running git fetch in my development VM triggers the 1Password prompt to grant access to the key"/> </p></div> </dialog> <a href="https://blog.disintegrator.dev/_astro/1password-ssh.IP7v-yeA.png"> <picture> <source srcset="/_astro/1password-ssh.IP7v-yeA_1QsVy9.webp 1280w" type="image/webp"/> <img src="https://blog.disintegrator.dev/_astro/1password-ssh.IP7v-yeA_ZK3oHH.png" srcset="/_astro/1password-ssh.IP7v-yeA_2dUt1R.png 1280w" loading="eager" alt="Running git fetch in my development VM triggers the 1Password prompt to grant access to the key" width="4416" height="2688" decoding="async"/> </picture> </a> </div> 
<p> When I want to access TCP services in the VM, such as development servers and databases, I use Tailscale which creates a nice DNS name for my guest VM that I can access from my host machine (see <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns"> MagicDNS </a>). Again, Tailscale is invisible software and I rarely pay attention to it except for when there’s an update. </p>

<p> The experience in macOS day-to-day is flawless. Nothing inside the VM can affect the performance of my overall system. I do not have any command-line tools installed on the host machine and no transitive dependencies of those to worry about compromising the host. All my development tools and editor extensions are sandboxed in a virtual machine boundary. It’s not perfect security but a useful level of defense and I still use <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html"> Little Snitch </a> pedantically to manage network access from various programs inside and outside the guest VM. </p>
<p> So much of this setup is largely transparent. I minimise the VMWare window and never think about it running in the background. As I mentioned, I don’t experience a performance hit inside the VM and if anything my overall system is very responsive even when heavy builds are running in the VM. </p>

<p> There are two conveniences I traded away for this setup: </p>
<ol> 
<li><code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> are not available between guest and host. I used to rely on these utilities often but I’ve learned to live without them as most of the time I am working in VS Code and it’s not an issue. In the terminal, I will select text with my mouse and copy it - a minor inconvenience but not a deal breaker.</li>
<li>I don’t use any disk sharing so I rely on <a href="https://mountainduck.io/"> Mountain Duck </a> to mount my VM over SFTP if I need to move files easily within macOS Finder although a lot of the time I can drag and drop files in VS Code.</li>
 </ol>
<p> Overall, I’ve adjusted to these trade-offs since they pop up rarely. </p>

<p> I think I’ve struck a very nice balance with my latest setup. Developing in a VM has security and stability benefits that are easy to appreciate when you’re a year or two into using a machine and it’s just humming along free from the mess of development tools and services that have been accumulating. In my case, some of this mess is necessary to develop and test code generation for multiple languages and so containing it was well worth the investment. I’m sure there are more areas I can improve but I’m happy with how it’s turned out. </p> </article> </div></div>
