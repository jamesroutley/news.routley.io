<h2><strong>Overbooking – how providers divide up the bandwidth</strong></h2>







<p>Most providers advertise their Internet subscriptions with the maximum available bandwidth – in addition to the price. These two parameters are easily comparable for customers and are often the decisive criterion when making a choice.</p>







<h3>Asymmetry</h3>



<p>As most residential customers require more bandwidth for downloading than for uploading, the available frequencies were divided up accordingly, resulting in asymmetry: 100/20 Mbit/s with DSL offers 100 Mbit/s bandwidth for downloading, but only 20 Mbit/s bandwidth for uploading. This restriction also applies to cable Internet, although the achievable bandwidth is greater with cable. The DOCSIS 3.1 standard used in Switzerland could theoretically reach 10/1 Gbit/s, while the DSL technologies currently in use stop at 500 Mbit/s.</p>



<p>In contrast to cable and DSL, fiber optics knows no limits. It is therefore not surprising that almost all network operators rely on fiber optics and ignore newer cable technologies such as DOCSIS 4.0 or 4.1. A fiber optic network is much easier to operate and also consumes less electricity, which is of course much more economical in the long term, even if the construction of fiber optics requires high investments.</p>







<h3>Network topologies</h3>



<p>While the DSL network has a P2P (Point-to-Point) network topology, cable TV networks are structured as P2MP (Point-to-Multipoint). DSL customers have their own private line up to the DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer, the provider’s device in the central office), which aggregates the DSL lines.</p>

<p>The technically available bandwidth on the coaxial cable is shared between all connected customers. As CMTS are expensive to purchase, some cable Internet providers have actually connected too many customers to one CMTS and thus overbooked the network. Only when there are complaints is a second CMTS installed.</p>







<h3>XGS-PON: The quasi-standard</h3>



<p>Most providers in Switzerland today rely on XGS-PON. As the name suggests, this is based on the PON topology and supports 10 (X) gigabit (G) symmetrical (S) bandwidth. This bandwidth is split between 2 and 128 customers using an optical splitter. Most providers in Switzerland use 32-customer splitters. This means that the nominal bandwidth of 10 Gbit/s is split between 32 customers.</p>

<p>It consists of one or two (redundancy) supervisor cards, each with 4 x 10 Gbit/s Ethernet uplinks, and 8 slots in which the XGS-PON line cards are installed. Each line card has 16 10 Gbit/s connections, each of which can serve one splitter.</p>







<h3>Overbooking</h3>



<p>This approach is called “overbooking”.</p>

It measures the latency (ping) to a destination. If too little bandwidth capacity is available, latency and packet loss increase massively. The example graphic shows very heavy overbooking during the day; the bandwidth is only sufficient at night. <a href="https://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/">https://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/</a></mark></figcaption></figure>







<h3>The business of the Internet provider</h3>



<p>Is overbooking legitimate? Basically yes, the business of every Internet provider works like this: you accumulate the bandwidth requirements of all customers and produce the necessary capacity. Of course, a provider does not consider an OLT or a switch separately, but adds up all devices and aggregates the traffic in the backbone. Traffic and other parameters are continuously evaluated using telemetry and alerts are sent in the event of anomalies. The volume of data consumed is measured and capacities must be continuously adapted to consumption. Periodic upgrades are therefore necessary. However, when these upgrades actually take place can vary depending on the self-image, return expectations, peering policy or the personal taste of the network architect. A sarcastic recommendation in the industry says: <em>“Design the capacity in such a way that no customer ever feels compelled to call support and complain about their slow Internet”.</em></p>







<h3>Overbooking at the expense of quality</h3>



<p>Overbooking is therefore flexible. (Nominal) bandwidth X is sold at price Y per month. That is what the customer signs up for. As a customer, you only realize that some providers overbook their available capacity far too much when you have signed a contract for one or two years, but only reach the bandwidth sold at 4 a.m. when most other customers are asleep. During primetime on Sunday evening at 8:30 pm, on the other hand, the Netflix stream is jerky, the shooter game lags and updating the apps on your cell phone takes forever. If this is the case, then the provider has overbooked too much *), but saved money at the expense of the quality of the user experience.</p>
