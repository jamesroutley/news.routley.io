<dd>
<p>Christian Selig, developer of the splendid Reddit client <a href="https://apolloapp.io/">Apollo</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ll cut to the chase: 50 million requests costs $12,000, a figure
far more than I ever could have imagined.</p>

<p>Apollo made 7 billion requests last month, which would put it at
about 1.7 million dollars per month, or 20 million US dollars per
year. Even if I only kept subscription users, the average Apollo
user uses 344 requests per day, which would cost $2.50 per month,
which is over double what the subscription currently costs, so I’d
be in the red every month.</p>

<p>I’m deeply disappointed in this price. Reddit iterated that the
price would be A) reasonable and based in reality, and B) they
would not operate like Twitter. Twitter’s pricing was <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/twitter-data-api-prices-out-nearly-everyone">publicly
ridiculed</a> for its obscene price of $42,000 for 50 million
tweets. Reddit’s is still $12,000. For reference, I pay Imgur, a
site similar to Reddit in userbase and media, $166 for the same 50
million API calls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Selig does some ballpark math and estimates that Reddit currently generates about $0.12 in revenue per month per active user. The average Apollo user would cost $2.50 per month in API fees — 20× higher.</p>

<p>Right now Apollo is free to use, but offers a Pro tier with a slew of additional features and fun stuff for a one-time payment of $5, and an Ultra tier with even more for a $13/year subscription. If Reddit goes through with this API pricing, Apollo’s free and Pro tiers would be unsustainable, and the Ultra subscription would have to cost at least $50 or $60 per year.</p>
