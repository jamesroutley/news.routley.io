    <h1>Trek, a Classic Game for DOS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><center>

<div><small><SPAN face="Arial">This is a classic version of the old program 
	TREK, inspired originally by the 1960&#39;s TV show <i>Star Trek</i>. </SPAN></small>
	<p><small><SPAN face="Arial">The original MS-BASIC version of this specific DOS 
	implementation was written by me in graduate 
	school in 1983 to emulate the FORTRAN version of Super Star 
	Trek that ran on our lab PDP-11/34. 
	That PDP-11/34 FORTRAN version of Super Star Trek was written around 1975, I believe by David Matuszek &amp; 
	Paul Reynolds with modifications by Don Smith. </SPAN></small></p>
	<p><small><SPAN face="Arial">Being often in a 
	low-temperature physics lab overnight nursing a He<sup>3</sup>-He<sup>4</sup> 
	dilution fridge, He<sup>3</sup> cryostat, or He<sup>4</sup> cryostat, I 
	often had too much time on my hands in between moments of sheer terror. 
	During those boring times, I rewrote my MS-BASIC version of TREK, greatly 
	expanding it&#39;s capabilities and sophistication in the 
	1980&#39;s. I converted it to Quick Basic 4.5 somewhere along the way, with the 
	final Quick Basic version written in 1991. That version, v3.0, is about 3000 lines of 
	code. </SPAN></small></p>
	<p><small><SPAN face="Arial">This is that version, with its expanded 
	capabilities.</SPAN></small></p>
	<p><SPAN face="Arial">TREK32M will run under 
	macOS. (Last tested on macOS Monterey.)</SPAN><small><SPAN face="Arial"></SPAN></small></p>
