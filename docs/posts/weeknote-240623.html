    <h1>Weeknote 240623</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><header></header><p>A “weeknote”, I am told, is best written on a Friday,
and yet here I am putting this second one up on Sunday night.
I am sovereign of my domain name, I shall do as I see fit.</p><ul><li>Like 15 people came out to my show last Saturday expressly to see me perform?</li><li>I&#39;m thoroughly touched. I haven&#39;t had that many people show up for me since college.</li><li>I&#39;m writing / performing music for a play that will be put on in November
that my friend Raymond wrote and is producing / directing.</li><li>The name of the play is “The Play About The Blowjob”, and our first rehearsal was this afternoon.</li><li>It was so fun! I read for one of the characters that doesn’t at the moment have an actor
and had a blast.</li><li>My cat Nastya is so loved. She might not be around for much longer.</li><li>I worked and reworked at the way TUI interaction feels all this week.</li><li>Realized that rather than “entities”, what I wanted was “events”,
which can be both posted and handler registered for.</li><li>So put together a “pub-sub” model inspired by <code>mediator_lua</code>.</li><li>This system is really great, especially that it’s accessible from basically anywhere.</li></ul></div></div>
