Here’s How</h2>
	






<div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
	
<p>Did you know 12 new Apple patents published in 2023 have Steve Jobs credited as one of the inventors?</p>



<p>The former CEO was well-known for his iconic design choices and proactive approach to patenting everything. To this date, Steven P. Jobs has 1,158 patents credited in total, of which 377 are utility-based and 781 are design patents. <strong>145</strong> among these were awarded after his demise in 2011. Interestingly, Apple’s current CEO, Tim Cook, has no patents to his name. </p>



<p>The last patent Jobs applied for was the <a href="https://tryslate.greyb.com/engage/USD712067S1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dramatic glass cube</a> for the entrance to the Apple store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York. It was granted in 2012. So, how do we still see Steve Jobs’s name in Apple’s recent patents?</p>



<p>This brief report entails reasons and scenarios why Apple still files patents with Steve Jobs’s name among the inventors.</p>



<p>The first and ideal thought goes to the patents he filed that were still being reviewed. So, we started our search from there.</p>



<h2>Steve Jobs’s Older Patents are Getting Approved</h2>

<p>Some complicated patents can take upwards of a few months or even years to be granted. 145 patents that Steve, among other inventors, applied for before his demise was granted afterward. </p>



<p>Our analysts explored patent databases using in-house tools, looking for intriguing updates to Steve’s expansive patent portfolio. We discovered many patents granted quite recently with Jobs’s name in them but were filed over a decade ago.</p>



<p>Here are the top 20 most cited patents applied on or before 2011, with Steve credited as one of the inventors.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>However, not all the patents crediting Steve Jobs were applied before 2011</h2>



<p>Steve played a significant role in creating many of Apple’s core products. Tim Wasko, the developer of Apple’s QuickTime, remembers that Steve had valuable comments and suggestions that made him worthy of a place on the patents. Most of his involvement was in hardware design and core UI patents.</p>



<p>Here is a list of Apple’s recently published patents filed after 2018 that carry Steve Jobs’s name. </p>



<p><em>Note: The list is analyzed on our in-house patent database, SLATE.</em></p>

<p>We were surprised by the number of new additions to Steve’s patent portfolio. But diving further, we found that the priority dates for all these patents are earlier than 2010. It’s evident that Apple still follows in his footsteps, incrementally innovating over his base ideas.  </p>

<h3>Continuation of Steve Jobs’s Granted Patents</h3>



<p>Deceased inventors can still win patents if the inventors seek a continuation of the IP. The continuation of a patent usually comes in the form of updated versions of the older patent. </p>



<p>Apple has ample resources to pour into this activity. Hence, we see lots of their older patents getting updated through continuation.</p>



<p>Let’s take an example of one such legacy patent- <a href="https://tryslate.greyb.com/engage/USD602015S1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electronic Device</a>.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="332" src="https://www.greyb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/electronic-device-1024x332.png" alt="electronic-device" srcset="https://www.greyb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/electronic-device-1024x332.png 1024w, https://www.greyb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/electronic-device-300x97.png 300w, https://www.greyb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/electronic-device-768x249.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></figure></div>


<p>This patent was initially filed in April 2008 and published in October 2009. We chose this patent because it’s one of Apple’s most valuable and foundational IP assets. Therefore, it will have many citations and updates done over the decades.</p>



<p>Below are all the updates and continuations of the same patent till the latest revision. Our analysts use GreyB’s vast IP libraries and in-house AI tools to get these highly specific results.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Each time there’s an update or continuation like the ones above, the patent’s inventors’ names make headlines again. Since Apple has many more Steve Jobs patents covering core technologies, his name repeatedly appears in patent systems accompanying the new application. Yet Apple isn’t the only company keeping Steve’s legacy alive.</p>



<h2>Other Patents referencing Steve Jobs’s Patents</h2>



<p>When inventors patent a new property based on Steve Jobs’ invention, they must reference his existing patents. In this event, Steve’s name is also attributed as an inventor of this new patent. Here are some examples of other companies collaborating with Apple, whose patents list Steve Jobs as an inventor. </p>



<p><strong>Savant Systems</strong>, a Massachusetts-based home automation company, worked with Apple to create a mechanism for remotely controlling the motion of a vehicle using a wireless mobile device. They filed the <a href="https://tryslate.greyb.com/engage/US9415849B2">patent</a> application in 2014, which was granted in 2016. They submitted an <a href="https://tryslate.greyb.com/engage/US10295999B2">updated patent</a> in 2016, which was granted in 2019. Steve Jobs’s name was among the inventors in both these patents.</p>



<p>Similarly, <strong>Teslamedics Inc. </strong>and Apple filed a <a href="https://tryslate.greyb.com/engage/US8196043B2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patent</a> application for the design of a media player progress bar granted in 2012. This patent was based on the <a href="https://tryslate.greyb.com/engage/US6538665B2">original patent</a> of that family, published in 2003. Apple remains the sole assignee of this patent, and Steve Jobs is among the inventors.</p>
