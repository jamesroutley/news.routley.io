<p dir="ltr"><strong>News Announced on Stage During Giant Bomb Panel at PAX East Conference</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>San Francisco, CA - May 10, 2025 </strong>- <a href="https://www.fandom.com/"><strong>Fandom</strong></a>, the world’s largest fan platform, is selling <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/"><strong>Giant Bomb</strong></a> to long-time Giant Bomb staff and gaming content creators Jeff Bakalar and Jeff Grubb. Financials of the deal were not disclosed. Giant Bomb’s programming, which was paused in order to work out the terms of this deal, will resume as quickly as possible. More details will be communicated soon by Giant Bomb’s new owners. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><u>Statement from Fandom</u></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">“Fandom has made the strategic decision to transition Giant Bomb back to its independent roots and the brand has been acquired by longtime staff and content creators, Jeff Bakalar and Jeff Grubb, who will now own and operate the site independently. Fans are at the core of everything we do at Fandom and we’re committed to not only serving them but also supporting the creators they love, and the sale of Giant Bomb represents a natural extension of that mission. We’re confident Giant Bomb is in good hands and its legacy will live on with Jeff and Jeff.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><u>Joint Statement from Jeff Bakalar and Jeff Grubb</u></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#34;Giant Bomb is now owned by the people who make Giant Bomb, and it would not have been possible without the speedy efforts of Fandom and our mutual agreement on what’s best for fans and creators. The future of Giant Bomb is now in the hands of our supporting community, who have always had our backs no matter what. We&#39;ll have a lot more to say about what this looks like soon, but for now, everyone can trust that all the support we receive goes directly to this team.&#34;</p>
