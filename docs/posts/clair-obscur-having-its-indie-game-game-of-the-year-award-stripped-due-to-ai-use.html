In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art in production on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination.&#34;</p>

            <p>While the assets in question were patched out, it still goes against the regulations we have in place. As a result, the IGAs nomination committee has agreed to officially retract both the Debut Game and Game of the Year awards.</p>

                									<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is exactly the sort of game to win Best Independent Game. They just don&#39;t usually win Game of the Year too.</p>

<p>&#34;Since the IGAs premiere took place just ahead of the holiday break, we expect both acceptance speeches to be recorded and published in early 2026,&#34; the statement concluded. </p>    
    
    
    
<p>As mentioned up top, the show premiered on Friday night, and featured a pre-recorded acceptance speech from Sandfall Interactive after its GOTY win. Now, that speech is for naught.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><h2 id="did-expedition-33-use-ai">
                        Did Expedition 33 Use AI?
               </h2><p>Earlier this week, Expedition 33 was dragged into the larger conversation over AI use in games <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/divinity-generative-ai-art/" target="_blank">after Larian CEO Swen Vincke affirmed that while there won&#39;t be Generative AI in the recently-announced Divinity project</a>, it doesn&#39;t mean the studio won&#39;t utilize the tool during development. </p>    <p>&#34;There is a lot of cleaning of the motion capture data, automatic retargeting, cutting up, the editing — there are generative AI aspects to that, because we have to train it on something to be able to figure out where to cut, where to how to retarget, etc.&#34; Vincke explained. &#34;Those are really huge benefits, because nobody wants to do this.&#34;</p>    <p>Those words eventually led people to question Expedition 33&#39;s Game of the Year wins, particularly after a July 2025 interview with El País began resurfacing in which COO &amp; Production Director François Meurisse confirmed that AI tools were part of the game&#39;s production. </p>    
    
    
    
<p>&#34;We use some AI, but not much,&#34; he said. &#34;The key is that we were very clear about what we wanted to do and what to invest in. And, of course, technology has allowed us to do things that were unthinkable a short time ago.&#34;</p>    

                

                    
    
                                                            <p>It&#39;s unclear, if, following this unprecedented move to strip a game of its already-won GOTY will lead to more disqualifications. What is clear is that a major awards show and governing body made it clear that AI will not be tolerated, even if it comes at the cost of an awards show.</p>
