    <h1>Germany to classify date rape drugs as weapons to ensure justice for survivors</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>Germany plans to treat the use of date rape drugs like the use of weapons in prosecutions as part of measures to ensure justice for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.</p><p>“We classify date rape drugs, which are increasingly used as a widespread tool in crimes, as weapons. This creates the basis for significantly stricter prosecutions,” Alexander Dobrindt, the interior minister, said on Friday. “We are committed to clear consequences and consistent enforcement. Women should feel safe and be able to move freely everywhere.”</p><p>Nearly 54,000 women and girls were the victims of sexual offences in Germany in 2024 – an increase of 2.1% on the previous year – of which nearly 36% were victims of rape and sexual assault.</p><p>A parliamentary debate over a bill calling for a mandatory minimum five-year prison sentence for the use of date rape drugs in sexual assaults was postponed last month.</p><p>Police last year registered a record high of almost 266,000 domestic violence victims, a 3.8% increase on the previous year. However, there were a high number of unreported cases, the head of the federal criminal police office, Holger Münch, said.</p><p>“We must work to ensure that more victims find the courage to report crimes in order to improve the protection and support for victims,” he added.</p><p>Although there is no uniform federal definition for femicide in Germany, nearly 1,200 women and girls were recorded as victims of homicide or attempted homicide in 2024, a slight decrease year on year.</p><p>The German government this week approved a draft law allowing the use of electronic ankle monitors to track perpetrators of domestic violence. Victims can also request a separate device to warn them when the perpetrator is nearby.</p><p>Dobrindt said the government had also secured funding for the national rollout of an app allowing domestic abuse victims to secretly document abuse incidents to be used later in court.</p></div></div></div>
