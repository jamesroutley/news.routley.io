<p>Traffic navigation app Waze is adding a new feature to its toolbox today. It&#39;s called crash history alerts, and it&#39;s meant to warn drivers about dangerous hotspots, based on a combination of historical data plus road and traffic data.</p>
<p>Originally an independent startup, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/google-acquires-waze-for-real-this-time-likely-for-1b-plus/">in 2013</a> Google purchased the Israeli company for $1.15 billion, perhaps <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/01/apple-may-buy-social-navigation-app-waze-to-bolster-maps/">beating Apple to the punch</a>. Even before the purchase, Waze was becoming an Ars reader favorite thanks to more advanced traffic rerouting than either Google Maps or Apple Maps.</p>
<p>It has not been entirely smooth <span>sailing</span>driving; for a while the app was infamous for asking drivers to make difficult left turns across busy multi-lane roads and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/waze-blamed-for-rise-in-accidents-along-one-of-steepest-streets-in-us/">routing cars through once-quiet neighborhoods as shortcuts</a>, aggravating the people who live in those neighborhoods.</p>
<p>After a long period operating as its own company, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/googles-cost-cutters-come-for-waze-will-lose-status-as-independent-company/">more recently</a> Google has been integrating Waze into its &#34;Geo&#34; division, home to Google Maps. That merger <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/06/waze-googles-other-mapping-app-gets-hit-with-layoffs/">was followed</a> this year by layoffs.</p>
<p>One feature of Waze that was unique for a long time was its ability to crowdsource traffic information. Users add live traffic information to the app as they drive, like a car stopped by the side of the road or a crash. Waze now leverages that data, together with geographic information, including road layout and elevation, plus typical traffic levels, to determine whether a particular stretch of road has a high crash rate. Should that be the case, the app will warn the driver.</p>

<p>However, Waze says that to minimize distractions, it won&#39;t show these alerts on regularly traveled roads and will limit alerts on unfamiliar roads to prevent driver overload.</p>
