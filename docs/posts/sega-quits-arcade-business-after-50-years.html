    <h1>Sega quits arcade business after 50 years</h1>

					<section><p>After more than 50 years, Sega has pulled out of the Japanese arcade business. </p><p>All of the company&#39;s remaining arcades will be sold to arcade company Genda Inc, which operates locations under the GiGo brand (thanks, <a href="https://tojodojo.com/sega-sell-all-remaining-shares-in-their-arcades-and-exit-the-arcade-buisness/">Tojodojo</a>). </p><p>Sega had signalled the move back in 2020 - which, as you might expect, was a particularly poor year for arcade revenue. Back then, it shifted 85 percent of its arcade shares to Genda. Now, it has offloaded the rest. </p>

<p>Of course, this is part of a much longer trend away from arcades towards gaming at home - a trend Japan has resisted for longer than many other countries. Over the years, countless arcade locations have shuttered. </p><p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-08-13-namco-funscape-london-closes-down-after-25-years">Namco Funscape London finally closed its doors after 25 years</a>.</p><p>Eurogamer&#39;s editor-in-chief and resident Japanese arcade fan Martin Robinson has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-09-21-arcade-hunting-in-akiba">previously chronicled some of his trips</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-09-15-i-think-i-just-fell-in-love-with-japanese-arcades-again">Tokyo&#39;s iconic arcade and anime district Akihabara</a>, and his memories from there.</p>
