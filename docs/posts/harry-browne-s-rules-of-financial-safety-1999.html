		<p>When you read in the news that a person whom you know as rich and wealthy is in financial trouble or has declared bankruptcy, it is easy to feel a sense of futility about managing your own money. You start to think that if such a rich person, who has access to the best financial advice, can come to this state, what chance do I have?</p>
<p>If you read deeper into his or her story you will find that he has come to this state because he violated some basic rule of life.<strong> The Golden Rules of Financial Safety of Harry Browne</strong> are the basic rules for financial success. They are simple and obvious and if you abide by them, there is less chance than one in a million that you could lose all that you have….</p>
<p>Let us learn what they are…</p>
<p><strong>Your career</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 1: Your career provides your wealth</strong></p>
<p>Build your wealth upon your career.You most likely will make far more money from your business or profession than from your investments. Only very rarely does someone make a large fortune from investments.</p>
<p><strong>Your Wealth May Be Non-Replaceable</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 2: Don’t assume you can replace your wealth.</strong></p>
<p>The fact that you earned what you have doesn’t mean that you could earn it again if you lost it. Markets and opportunities change, technology changes, laws change. Conditions today may be considerably different from what they were when you built the estate you have now. And as time passes, increasing regulation makes it harder and harder to amass a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>Investing vs. Speculating</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 3: Recognize the difference between investing and speculating.</strong></p>
<p>When you invest, you accept the return the markets are paying investors in general. When you speculate, you attempt to beat that return — to do better than other investors are doing — through astute timing, forecasting, or stock selection, and with the implied belief that you’re smarter than most other investors.</p>
<p>You’re speculating when:</p>
<ol>
<li>You select individual stocks, mutual funds, or stock market sectors you believe will do better than the market as a whole.</li>
<li>You move your capital in and out of markets according to how well you think they’ll perform in the near future.</li>
<li>You base your investments on current prospects for the nation’s economy.</li>
<li>You use fundamental analysis, technical analysis, cyclical analysis, or any other form of analysis or system to tell you when to buy and sell.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with speculating — provided you do it with money you can afford to lose. But the money that’s precious to you shouldn’t be risked on a bet that you can outperform other investors.</p>
<p><strong>Forecasting the Future</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 4: No one can predict the future.</strong></p>
<p>Beware of fortune tellers.</p>
<p><strong>Investment Advice</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 5: No one can move you in and out of investments consistently with precise and profitable timing.</strong></p>
<p>Don’t expect anyone to make you rich. You’ll hear about many Wall Street wizards, but the investment advisor with the perfect record up to now most likely will lose his touch the moment you start acting on his advice.</p>
<p><strong>Trading Systems</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 6: No trading system will work as well in the future as it did in the past.</strong></p>
<p>You’ll come across many trading systems or indicators that seem always to have signaled correctly where your money should have been, but somehow the systems never come through when your money is on the line.</p>
<p><strong>Operate on a Cash Basis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 7: Don’t use leverage.</strong></p>
<p>When someone goes completely broke, it’s almost always because he used borrowed money. In many cases, the individual was already quite rich, but he wanted to pyramid his fortune with borrowed money.</p>
<p><strong>Make Your Own Decisions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 8: Don’t let anyone make your decisions.</strong></p>
<p>Many people lost their fortunes because they gave someone (a financial advisor or attorney) the authority to make their decisions and handle their money. The advisor may have taken too many chances, been dishonest, or simply incompetent. But, most of all, no advisor can be expected to treat your money with the same respect you do.</p>
<p><strong>Understand What You Do</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 9: Don’t ever do anything you don’t understand.</strong></p>
<p>Don’t undertake any investment, speculation, or investment program that you don’t understand. If you do, you may later discover risks you weren’t aware of. Or your losses might turn out to be greater than the amount you invested.</p>
<p><strong>Diversification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 10: Don’t depend on any one investment, institution, or person for your safety.</strong></p>
<p>Every investment has its time in the sun — and its moment of shame. Precious metals ruled the roost in the 1970s while stocks and bonds were in disgrace. But then gold and silver became the losers of the 1980s and 1990s, while stocks and bonds multiplied their value. No one investment is good for all times. Even Treasury bills can lose real value during times of inflation.</p>
<p><strong>Balanced Portfolio</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 11: Create a bulletproof portfolio for protection.</strong></p>
<p>For the money you need to take care of you for the rest of your life, set up a simple, balanced, diversified portfolio. I call this a “Permanent Portfolio” because once you set it up, you never need to rearrange the investment mix— even if your outlook for the future changes.</p>
<p>The portfolio should assure that your wealth will survive any event – including events that would be devastating to any one investment.Three absolute requirements for such a portfolio are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Safety:</strong>It should protect you against every possible economic future. You should profit during times of normal prosperity, but you also should be safe (and perhaps even profit) during bad times – inflation, recession, or even depression.</p>
<p><strong>2. Stability:</strong>Whatever economic climate arrives, the portfolio’s performance should be so steady that you won’t wonder whether the portfolio needs to be changed. Even in the worst possible circumstances, the portfolio’s value should drop no more than slightly – so that you won’t panic and abandon it. This stability also permits you to turn your attention away from your investments, confident that your portfolio will protect you in any circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>3. Simplicity:</strong>The portfolio should be so easy to maintain, and require so little of your time, that you’ll never be tempted to look for something that seems simpler, but is less safe.</p>
<p>You leave it alone – to hold the same investments, in the same proportions, permanently. You don’t change the proportions as you, your friends, or investment gurus change their minds about the future.</p>
<p>Your portfolio needs to respond well only to those broad movements. And they fit into four general categories:</p>
<p><strong>1. Prosperity:</strong>A period during which living standards are rising, the economy is growing, business is thriving, interest rates usually are falling, and unemployment is declining.</p>
<p><strong>2. Inflation:</strong>A period when consumer prices generally are rising. They might be rising moderately (an inflation rate of 6% or so), rapidly (10% to 20% or so, as in the late 1970s), or at a runaway rate (25% or more).</p>
<p><strong>3. Tight money or recession:</strong>A period during which the growth of the supply of money in circulation slows down. This leaves people with less cash than they expected to have, and usually leads to a recession – a period of poor economic conditions.</p>
<p><strong>4. Deflation:</strong>The opposite of inflation. Consumer prices decline and the purchasing power value of money grows. In the past, deflation has sometimes triggered a depression – a prolonged period of very bad economic conditions, as in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Investment prices can be affected by what happens outside the financial system – wars, changes in government policies, new tax rules, civil turmoil, and other matters. But these events have a lasting effect on investments only if they push the economy from one to another of the four environments I’ve just described. The four economic categories are all-inclusive. At any time, one of them will predominate. So if you’re protected in these four situations, you’re protected in all situations.</p>
<p>Thus four investments provide coverage for all four economic environments:</p>
<p><strong>STOCKS</strong> take advantage of prosperity. They tend to do poorly during periods of inflation, deflation, and tight money, but over time those periods don’t undo the gains that stocks achieve during periods of prosperity.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS</strong> also take advantage of prosperity. In addition, they profit when interest rates collapse during a deflation. You should expect bonds to do poorly during times of inflation and tight money.</p>
<p><strong>GOLD</strong> not only does well during times of intense inflation, it does very well. In the 1970s, gold rose twenty times over as the inflation rate soared to its peak of 15% in 1980. Gold generally does poorly during times of prosperity, tight money, and deflation.</p>
<p><strong>CASH</strong> is most profitable during a period of tight money. Not only is it a liquid asset that can give you purchasing power when your income and investments might be ailing, but the rise in interest rates increases the return on your dollars. Cash also becomes more valuable during a deflation as prices fall. Cash is essentially neutral during a time of prosperity, and it is a loser during times of inflation.</p>
<p>Any attempt to be clever in assigning portions to the investments probably will do more harm than good. I prefer the simplicity of allocating 25% to each of the four investments.</p>
<p>The only maintenance required is to check the portfolio’s makeup once a year.</p>
<p>If any of the four investments has become worth less than 15%, or more than 35%, of the portfolio’s overall value, you need to restore the original percentages.</p>
<p>When you make your once-a-year check of the portfolio’s value, if all four investments are within the 15-35% range, no rebalancing is necessary. During the year, if you happen to notice that there’s been a big change in investment prices, you may want to check the values of the investments. Again, if any investment has strayed outside the 15-35% range, go ahead and rebalance the entire portfolio.</p>
<p>The test of a Permanent Portfolio is whether it provides peace of mind. A Permanent Portfolio should let you watch the evening news or read investment publications in total serenity. No actual or threatened event should trouble you, because you’ll know that your portfolio is protected against it.</p>
<p>If someone warns about the “alarming parallels” between the current decade and the 1920s, you shouldn’t wonder whether you need to sell all your stocks. You’ll know that your Permanent Portfolio will take care of you – even if next year turns out to be 1929 revisited. The deflation that could devastate stocks would push interest rates downward and bring big profits for your bonds.</p>
<p>When someone claims the inflation rate is headed back to 15%, you shouldn’t wonder whether to dump all your bonds. You’ll know that the gain in your Permanent Portfolio’s gold would far outweigh any losses on the bonds.</p>
<p>When someone announces that a new debt crisis is on the way, or that a bull market is about to begin in stocks, bonds, or gold, you won’t feel pressured to decide whether he’s right. You’ll know that the Permanent Portfolio will respond favorably to any eventuality.</p>
<p>I can’t list every potential event. So if you become concerned by any possibility, reread this chapter and you should be reassured that there’s an investment in your Permanent Portfolio that will cover you if the worst should occur. Whatever the potential crisis or opportunity, your Permanent Portfolio should already be taking care of you.</p>
<p>The portfolio can’t guarantee a profit every year; no portfolio can. It won’t outperform the hotshot advisor in his best year. And it won’t outperform the best investment of the year. But it can give you the confidence that no crisis will destroy you, the assurance that your savings are secure and growing in all circumstances, and the knowledge that you’re no longer vulnerable to the mistakes in judgment that you or the best advisor could so easily make.</p>
<p><strong>Speculation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 12: Speculate only with money you can afford to lose.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to try to beat the market, set up a second — separate — portfolio with which you can speculate to your heart’s content. But make sure this portfolio contains no more of your wealth than you can afford to lose.</p>
<p><strong>International Diversification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 13: Keep some assets outside the country in which you live.</strong></p>
<p>Don’t allow everything you own to be where your government can touch it. By having something outside the reach of your government, you’ll be less vulnerable — and you’ll feel less vulnerable. You’ll no longer have to worry so much about what the government will do next.</p>
<p><strong>Tax Shelters</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 14: Beware of tax-avoidance schemes.</strong></p>
<p>Tax rates are still low enough in the U.S. that you might gain very little from the risk and effort of constructing elaborate tax shelters. And a great deal of money has been lost by people who hoped to beat the tax system. The losses came from investments that provided special tax advantages but didn’t make economic sense, and from tax shelters that were disallowed by the IRS — incurring penalties and interest on top of the liabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 15: Ask the right questions</strong></p>
<p>In what economic circumstances is the investment’s price likely to go down?</p>
<p><strong>Enjoyment</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 16: Enjoy yourself with a budget for pleasure.</strong></p>
<p>Your wealth is of no value if you can’t enjoy it. But it’s easy to spend too much while the money’s flowing in. To enjoy your wealth, establish a budget of money that you can spend yearly without concern. If you stay within that amount, you can feel free to blow the money on cars, trips, anything you want — knowing that you aren’t blowing your future.</p>
<p><strong>When in Doubt . . .</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 17: Whenever you’re in doubt about a course of action, it is always better to err on the side of safety.</strong></p>
<p>If you pass up an opportunity to increase your fortune, another one will be along soon enough. But if you lose your life savings just once, you might never get a chance to replace it.</p>
<p><strong>The Rules of Life</strong></p>
<p>The rules of safe investing are little different from the rules of life: recognize that you live in an uncertain world, don’t expect the impossible, and don’t trust strangers. If you apply to your investments the same realistic attitude that produced your present wealth, you needn’t fear that you’ll ever go broke.</p>
