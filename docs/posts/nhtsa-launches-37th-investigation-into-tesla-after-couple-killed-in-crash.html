<p>GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA: A couple from Lompoc in California were killed when the <a href="https://meaww.com/tesla-florida-man-dies-model-s-car-crash-family-door-handles-defective-futuristic-hinderd-rescue?utm_source=meawwdotcom&amp;utm_medium=article-related&amp;utm_campaign=575802" target="" rel="">Tesla car</a> they were traveling in crashed into the back of a Walmart semi-truck, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating the crash, which happened just before 2 pm on Wednesday, July 6, in the parking lot of the Paynes Prairie rest area.</p><p><span>ADVERTISEMENT</span></p>
<p>As per the reports by <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10998257/NHTSA-opens-THIRTY-SEVENTH-probe-Tesla-elderly-couple-California-killed.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DailyMail</a>, safety officials have opened the 37th probe into a Tesla crash after a California couple, aged 66 and 67, was killed in the crash. The images from the crash indicate the front end of a red Tesla, which is a 2015 S model, crashed into the back of a Walmart semi-truck while the couple was driving on Interstate-75 southbound. The victims were declared dead at the scene.</p><p><span>ADVERTISEMENT</span></p>

<p>Highway Patrol Lt PV Riordan told the portal that the authorities are looking into whether the automated features were involved in the crash. The report further suggests that previous autopilot-related crashes were linked to the Teslas&#39; cameras being confused by flashing lights and reflectors on stopped emergency vehicles. </p>
<p>The 2015 Teslas were the first to use this technology, however, didn&#39;t include fully automated features. Tesla also wrote in a <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/your-autopilot-has-arrived" rel="nofollow">blog</a> that &#34;the driver is still responsible for, and ultimately in control of, the car.&#34;</p><p><span>ADVERTISEMENT</span></p>
<h2>The ongoing investigation</h2>
<p>Earlier in June, the NHTSA escalated its defect investigation into 830,000 Tesla (TSLA.O) vehicles equipped with Autopilot, a necessary step before requesting a recall. While Tesla did not reply to a request for comment, the NHTSA informed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-agency-sought-answers-tesla-autopilot-april-2021-letter-2022-06-21/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a> it was aware of &#34;and in conversations with Tesla&#34; about the Florida tragedy.</p><p><span>ADVERTISEMENT</span></p>
