    <h1>Right to Repair laws have now been introduced in all 50 us states</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>With the introduction of <a href="https://www.midwestfarmreport.com/2025/02/21/sen-pfaff-introduces-right-to-repair-legislation/">a bill in Wisconsin</a>, Right to Repair legislation has now been introduced in <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/release-all-50-states-now-have-filed-right-to-repair-legislation-over-last-8-years/">every single US state</a>. </p>



<p>We’ve been fighting for the simple right to fix everything we own for the last eleven years—and we’ve been joined in that fight by more and more advocates, tinkerers, farmers, students, and lawmakers. Today, that movement has touched every corner of the country. Lawmakers in every state in the union have <a href="https://www.repair.org/legislation">filed legislation</a> demanding access to the parts, tools, and documentation we need for repair. This year alone, legislation is active in 24 states. </p>

<h2>One in Five Americans Is Protected by Right to Repair Legislation</h2>



<p>Some of those laws have passed: Five states (<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/70515/new-york-passes-historic-right-to-repair-bill">New York</a>, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/84491/california-right-to-repair-signed-into-law">California</a>, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/75965/minnesotas-new-right-to-repair-law-will-give-the-whole-world-repair-manuals">Minnesota</a>, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/92144/oregon-just-struck-a-blow-to-parts-pairing-and-won-a-decade-of-repair-support">Oregon</a>, and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/96296/colorado-adds-electronics-to-right-to-repair-protections">Colorado</a>) have passed electronics Right to Repair legislation. One in five Americans lives in a state that has passed Right to Repair—and the remaining states are working hard to restore repair competition.</p>



<p>“Here, there and everywhere—people just want to fix their stuff,” said PIRG’s Senior Right to Repair Campaign Director Nathan Proctor. “Americans are fed up with all the ways in which manufacturers of everything from toasters to tractors frustrate or block repairs, and lawmakers are hearing that frustration and taking action.”</p>

<h2>iFixit’s Eleven Years of Advocacy</h2>



<p>We’ve been boots-on-the-ground fighting for Right to Repair since <a href="https://www.repair.org/history">the very beginning</a>, working to develop and testifying on behalf of the first electronics bill, introduced in South Dakota in 2014. Since then, we’ve worked closely with our US advocacy partners, Repair.org and PIRG, to advance legislation. </p>



<p>“Now that Wisconsin filed their first Right to Repair legislation, we’ve completed the sweep of getting bills filed in all 50 states. Our legislative map no longer has any blanks,” said Gay Gordon-Byrne, Executive Director at Repair.org. “This proves that Right to Repair is needed everywhere—and we are well on our way towards making that happen.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/3970/2012-the-year-of-the-fixer">When we first got involved</a> in Right to Repair, it felt like an uphill battle. Manufacturers told legislators there was no problem—so we brought in repair professionals, did surveys, and shared our repairability expertise to prove that things were really becoming increasingly hard to fix. Manufacturers told legislators that sharing repair information would make it impossible for them to protect their trade secrets and would be dangerous to customers—so we brought in experts, shared data, and proved that repair information is not protected and changing batteries isn’t dangerous.</p>



<p>Over time, more and more legislators joined the fight. The message is simple: If you bought it, you should be able to fix it. And soon, companies started to work with us instead of against us. Now, Google is a major supporter of Right to Repair legislation in the US, and even Apple has come on board to support some laws.</p>



<p>“This is more than a legislative landmark—it’s a tipping point. We’ve gone from a handful of passionate advocates to a nationwide call for repair autonomy,” said Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit. “People are fed up with disposable products and locked-down devices. Repair is the future, and this moment proves it.”</p>

<h2>We’re Not Done Fighting</h2>



<p>Having introduced bills in all 50 states is a massive milestone. It means more pressure on lawmakers, more attention from manufacturers, and more opportunities for all of us to demand repair-friendly products. But we’re not done yet. We’ll keep pushing for stronger laws, better standards, and a future where repair autonomy is a given, not a privilege.</p>



<p>Thank you for being part of this journey. Let’s keep fixing what matters.</p>
