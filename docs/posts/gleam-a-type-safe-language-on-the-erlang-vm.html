    <h1>Gleam: a type safe language on the Erlang VM</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">

    <p>
        The power of a type system, the expressiveness of functional
        programming, and the reliability of the highly concurrent, fault
        tolerant Erlang runtime, with a familiar and modern syntax.

      <h2>Reliable and scalable</h2>
      <p>
        Running on the battle-tested Erlang virtual machine that powers
        planet-scale systems such as WhatsApp and Ericsson, Gleam is ready for
        workloads of any size.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to a multi-core actor based concurrency system that can run
        millions of concurrent tasks, fast immutable data structures, and a
        concurrent garbage collector that never stops the world, your service can
        scale and stay lightning fast with ease.

      <h2>Ready when you are</h2>
      <p>
        Gleam comes with compiler, build tool, formatter, editor integrations,
        and package manager all built in, so creating a Gleam project is just
        running <code>gleam new</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of the wider BEAM ecosystem, Gleam programs can use thousands
        of published packages, whether they are written in Gleam, Erlang, or
        Elixir.

      <h2>Here to help</h2>
      <p>
        No null values, no exceptions, clear error messages, and a practical
        type system. Whether you&#39;re writing new code or maintaining old code,
        Gleam is designed to make your job as fun and stress-free as possible.
      </p>

      <h2>Multilingual</h2>
      <p>
        Gleam makes it easy to use code written in other BEAM languages such
        as Erlang and Elixir, so there&#39;s a rich ecosystem of thousands of open
        source libraries for Gleam users to make use of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gleam can additionally compile to JavaScript, enabling you to use your
        code in the browser, or anywhere else JavaScript can run. It also
        generates TypeScript definitions, so you can interact with your Gleam
        code confidently, even from the outside.
