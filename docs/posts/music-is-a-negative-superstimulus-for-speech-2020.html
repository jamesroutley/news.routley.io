<h2>What is Music A Superstimulus For, If Anything?</h2>

<p>If music is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_stimulus">superstimulus</a>, it has to be a superstimulus <i>for</i> something.</p>

<p>There is one thing other than music which is like music, and that thing is <i>speech</i>.</p>

<p>There are important similarities between speech and music:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Speech has rhythm.</li>
  <li>Speech has &#34;melody&#34;.</li>
  <li>A lot of music actually includes a form of speech, ie song lyrics.</li>
</ul>

<p>So if music is a superstimulus for something, it&#39;s probably a superstimulus for speech.</p>

<p>However, music cannot be a superstimulus for speech <i>per se</i>.</p>

<p>Rather it has to be a superstimulus for some aspect of the <i>perception</i>
  of speech.</p>

<p>In other words, music is speech that feels like it is very [<b>X</b>], where <b>X</b>
  is the aspect of perception in question.</p>

<p>So, what is <b>X</b>?</p>

<h2>Positive vs Negative</h2>

<p>There are many things that <b>X</b> might be.</p>

<p>Whatever <b>X</b> is, we expect the perception of it to have some effect on how
the listener responds to speech, or on how the listener processes speech information.</p>

<p>This effect might be <i>positive</i>, or it might be <i>negative</i>.</p>

<p>To give a concrete example, I will consider the possibility that the perception
of <b>X</b> influences how strongly the listener pays <i>attention</i> to speech:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If <b>X</b> is a positive aspect, then a listener will pay <i>more</i> attention to speech with
    a high level of <b>X</b>.</li>
  <li>If <b>X</b> is a negative aspect, then a listener will pay <i>less</i> attention to speech with
    a high level of <b>X</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Music is something that people like to pay attention to, so this would seem to argue strongly
  that music is a positive superstimulus.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used <i>attention</i> here as an example of an aspect of processing that the perception
  of <b>X</b> acts on.</p>

<p>But, if you continue to read, you will learn that the real target of the perception
  of <b>X</b>, ie the component of information processing that it affects most strongly, is not attention.
  It&#39;s something else.</p>

<h2>Positive implies unconditionally &#34;better&#34;</h2>

<p>If music is a positive superstimulus for some aspect of speech perception, then this implies
  that music is perceived as being a &#34;better speech than speech&#34;.</p>

<p>If this is the case, then speakers would be expected to exploit this perception by
  making their speech more musical in any situation where they are speaking and they want their
  speech to have more effect on the listener.</p>

<p>But this doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>In particular, people <i>never</i> musicalize conversational speech.</p>

<p>(You can try, but I guarantee you will ruin the vibe of the conversation.)</p>

<h2>If not positive, then maybe negative ...</h2>

<p>If the evidence suggests that music is not unconditionally &#34;better&#34; than speech,
  and we still think that music might be a superstimulus, then we need to consider
  the possibility that music is a superstimulus for a <i>negative</i> aspect of speech perception,
and that music is a &#34;worse speech than speech&#34;.</p>

<p>If music is a negative superstimulus, then we need to identify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The aspect <b>X</b> of speech perception that music is a superstimulus for</li>
  <li>The component <b>C</b> of speech processing that is negatively affected by the
  perception of <b>X</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>A Model of Conversational Speech Processing</h2>

<p>I have developed a model of conversational speech processing which is consistent with what
  I think I know about the effects of music on mental state, and which is
  consistent with the observation that people do not &#34;musicalize&#34; their conversational speech, not ever.</p>

<p>This model explains how it is that music completely suppresses one of the steps in the processing
of speech information by a listener.</p>

<p>In this model:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>X</b> is the perceived <i>non-spontaneity</i> of a speaker&#39;s speech.</li>
  <li><b>C</b> is the determination of the listener&#39;s belief about the truth of what the speaker said.</li>
</ul>

<p>Firstly we assume that a speaker has said something to the listener, as part of a conversation.</p>

<p>The basic steps of processing, in the normal (non-musical) case, are:</p>

<ol>
   <li>The listener determines the <i>meaning</i> of what the speaker said.</li>
   <li>The listener determines the <i>emotional significance</i> of the meaning of
     what the speaker said.</li>
   <li>The listener determines their belief about the <i>truth</i> of what the speaker
     said.</li>
   <li>The listener responds to the speaker, where their response includes an indication of
   their belief about the truth of what the speaker said.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is an additional consequence of step 3 on the result of step 2, which is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The intensity of emotional response to the determined meaning is <i>reduced</i> according
  to the determination of belief about the truth of what was said.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, if it&#39;s probably not true, then there is no reason to feel any strong emotion
  about what was said.</p>

<h3>A model of conversational value</h3>

<p>The basic model is a &#34;happy case&#34; model, where the listener assumes that the speaker&#39;s speech
  is genuine conversational speech.</p>

<p>What do I mean by &#34;genuine&#34;?</p>

<p>Genuine conversational speech is speech that directly reflects what the speaker has decided to say
  &#34;in the moment&#34;, based on the current context of the conversation.</p>

<p>The context of any actual conversation is constantly changing, as a direct result of what the
  participants are saying.</p>

<p>Any attempt to say something that is rehearsed, or pre-planned, will not be an honest reflection
  of the speaker&#39;s current thought processes based on the current context of the conversation.</p>

<p>This suggests a possible extra component in the speech processing model, which is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The listener has to decide whether it is worth the effort to evaluate the truth value of what the
    speaker said, and whether it is worth the effort to respond to the speaker with an indication of
  that evaluated truth value.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a listener responds with a genuine &#34;in the moment&#34; evaluation of what the speaker said, but the
  speaker&#39;s original speech was not &#34;in the moment&#34;, then there has been an uneven exchange of information.</p>

<p>In order to enforce a fair exchange, the listener has to determine, as best they can, whether or
  not the speaker&#39;s speech is truly &#34;in the moment&#34;.</p>

<p>In other words:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the speaker&#39;s speech perceived to be <i>spontaneous</i>?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Including conversational &#34;value&#34; in the model</h3>

<p>A revised model, that includes this evaluation, is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The listener determines the <i>meaning</i> of what the speaker said.</li>
  <li>The listener determines the <i>emotional significance</i> of the meaning of
    what the speaker said.</li>
  <li>The listener determines whether of not the speaker&#39;s speech is <i>spontaneous</i>.</li>
  <li>The listener determines their belief about the <i>truth</i> of what the speaker
    said, but, the amount of effort put into this determination is proportional to the perceived
  level of spontaneity in the speaker&#39;s speech.</li>
  <li>The listener responds to the speaker, where their response includes an indication of
    their belief about the truth of what the speaker said.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Applying the model to perception of music</h3>

<p>We can now account for what happens in the musical case, where the &#34;speech&#34;, if any,
  consists of the lyrics of the song:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The listener determines the <i>meaning</i> of what the speaker said (ie the song lyrics).</li>
  <li>The listener determines the <i>emotional significance</i> of the meaning of
    what the speaker said.</li>
  <li>The listener determines that the speaker&#39;s speech is extremely non-spontaneous.</li>
  <li>The listener&#39;s determination of their belief about the <i>truth</i> of what the speaker
    said <i>does not happen at all</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the normal non-musical case, the evaluation of truth value results in a reduction of the emotional
  intensity.</p>

<p>But in the musical case, the evaluation of truth value does not happen, so the reduction of
  emotional intensity does not happen.</p>

<p>The result is that the negative effect that music has on the listener&#39;s processing of speech
  causes what appears to be a positive increase in the emotional response to the speaker&#39;s speech.</p>

<p>But the positive increase isn&#39;t really an increase – it&#39;s just a non-occurrence of a decrease.</p>

<p>The final result of all this is that the listener&#39;s brain remains in an intermediate processing state, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The meaning of what a speaker has said is represented.</li>
  <li>The emotional significance of that meaning is represented, at full intensity.</li>
  <li>No attempt has been made to evaluate the truth value of what the speaker said – the
    meaning remains in a completely hypothetical state.</li>
</ul>

<p>That article also includes discussion of other aspects of the theory, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The emotional effect of music on meanings that don&#39;t necessarily come from song lyrics.</li>
  <li>Evidence that music is not just a &#34;side effect&#34; of the conversational processing model, and it
    must serve a biological function.</li>
   <li>Speculation about what the biological function of music might be.</li>
</ul>
