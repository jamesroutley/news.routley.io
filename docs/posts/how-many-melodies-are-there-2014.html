    <h1>How many melodies are there? (2014)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The equivalent of a writer staring at a blank page, wondering how to fill it, is a composer staring at the 88 black and white notes on a piano wondering how to compose a melody that&#39;s never been heard before.  How can one possibly take the eight notes of a standard scale and write a brand new melody when so many great melodies have already been written? Perhaps they&#39;ve all been taken!</p>

<div><p><img src="https://plus.maths.org/content/sites/plus.maths.org/files/articles/2014/Oli/notes.jpg" alt="Notes" width="350" height="280"/></p><p>How many combinations are there?</p>
</div>


<p>So, to counter the fear of there being no new melodies, I thought it would be interesting to examine the number of melodies available to a composer looking at his blank stave to see how many there potentially are. </p>

<p>The first thing to do is to lay down some ground rules. These are:</p>

<ol><li>The melodies will be a single stream of notes — no chords, counter-melodies or basslines — just a single line of music. Remember the &#34;old grey whistle test&#34;? If it can be played on a tin whistle — it&#39;s a melody. </li>

<li>For the first section I&#39;ve discounted rhythm so as to focus only on the permutations of notes.</li>

<li>All melodies should be contained within an octave — C to C&#39; inclusive.  </li>

<li>Any of the 13 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr2rXc9Qu4A">chromatic notes</a> of the octave can be used. I&#39;ve not restricted this to just a major or minor scale as many great melodies use <em>accidentals</em> (the black notes in a C major scale). So we can include all of the notes within the octave, including the octave jump (from C to C&#39;) as otherwise <em>Over the Rainbow</em> would not count as a melody! The notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, C&#39;.</li></ol>

<p>We will tackle this problem by starting with the simplest possible melody — one consisting of two notes — and then building up the melody length one note at a time until we see a pattern that can be turned into a formula.</p>

<h3>Two note melodies</h3>

<p>How many two note melodies can be written within an octave? This one is easy and all combinations can be written out: </p>

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><center><strong>Melodies that go up in pitch</strong></center></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>First note</strong></td><td><strong>Second note</strong></td><td><strong>Pitch difference (semitones)</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>C#</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>D#</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>E</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>F</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>F#</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>G</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>G#</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>A</td><td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>A#</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>B</td><td>11</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>C&#39;</td><td>12</td></tr></tbody></table>


<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><center><strong>Melodies that go down in pitch</strong></center></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>First note</strong></td><td><strong>Second note</strong></td><td><strong>Pitch difference (semitones)</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>C&#39;</td><td>C&#39;</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>C&#39;</td><td>B</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>C&#39;</td><td>A#</td><td>-2</td></tr>
<tr><td>C&#39;</td><td>A</td><td>-3</td></tr>
<tr><td>C&#39;</td><td>G#</td><td>-4</td></tr>
<tr><td>C&#39;</td><td>G</td><td>-5</td></tr>
<tr><td>C&#39;</td><td>F#</td><td>-6</td></tr>
<tr><td>C&#39;</td><td>F</td><td>-7</td></tr>
<tr><td>C&#39;</td><td>E</td><td>-8</td></tr>
<tr><td>C&#39;</td><td>D#</td><td>-9</td></tr>
<tr><td>C&#39;</td><td>D</td><td>-10</td></tr>
<tr><td>C&#39;</td><td>C#</td><td>-11</td></tr>
<tr><td>C&#39;</td><td>C</td><td>-12</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>
Now, you might be wondering why combinations like G# - F and  E – A are not included. This is because we are only interested in relative pitch, not absolute notes.  For the purposes of this exercise the melody C – C is identical to D – D or G – G as they are all <em>unison melodies</em> (i.e., they have 0 as their pitch difference).  That&#39;s why we won&#39;t count  the unison melody C&#39; – C&#39; — unison was already covered in the first table by C – C.</p>

<p>Having excluded C&#39; - C&#39; we have a total of 25 exciting two-note melodies! </p>

<h3>Three note melodies</h3>

<p>The number of three note melodies rises quite sharply, but not so much that they can&#39;t also be written out. </p>

<div><p><img src="https://plus.maths.org/content/sites/plus.maths.org/files/articles/2014/Oli/spreadsheet2.png" alt="Spreadsheet" width="300" height="324"/></p><p>A small extract of the spreadsheet that lists all 2197 three-note combinations with duplicates in grey. You can see the whole spreadsheet <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/sites/plus.maths.org/files/articles/2014/Oli/combinations_spreadsheet.xlsx">here</a>. </p>
</div>




<p>We can start by listing all possible combinations of three notes and then crossing out those that are duplicates. It turns out that it&#39;s easy to find duplicates: they are exactly  those sequences of notes that don&#39;t have any C in them. Any melody without a C can always be moved down the scale until its lowest note becomes a C. Therefore, any melody without a C is a duplicate of a melody that does contain a C. To count all melodies, all we have to do is to count all sequences of notes than contain a C. </p>

<p>There are exactly  2,197 three-note combinations, out of which 1,728 don&#39;t contain a C. So there is a total of  2,197 – 1,728 = 469 three note melodies.</p>

<p>Not bad!</p>

<h3>Four to infinity</h3>

<p> Now, writing down all possible combinations of notes and picking out the ones with a C is not a very efficient way of exploring further, so we need an equation that will describe the increase in melodies. Suppose we are counting melodies made out of <img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/acfe84d0716048a81bf4bd49245092cf/images/img-0001.png" alt="$n$"/> notes (so we’ve already covered <img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/acfe84d0716048a81bf4bd49245092cf/images/img-0002.png" alt="$n=2$"/> and <img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/acfe84d0716048a81bf4bd49245092cf/images/img-0003.png" alt="$n=3$"/>). There are 13 choices for what the first note could be (one of C through to C’), 13 choices for the second note, and so on. This means that the number of all sequences of <img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/acfe84d0716048a81bf4bd49245092cf/images/img-0001.png" alt="$n$"/> notes is </p><table id="a0000000002">
<tbody><tr>
    
    <td> </td>
    <td><img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/acfe84d0716048a81bf4bd49245092cf/images/img-0004.png" alt="\[ \underbrace{13 \times 13 \times ... \times 13}_{n} = 13^ n. \]"/></td>
    
    <td> </td>
    <td> </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><p>From this we need to subtract the sequences that don’t have a C in them. For such a sequence there are 12 choices for the first note, 12 choices for the second note, and so on. So the number of all sequences of <img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/acfe84d0716048a81bf4bd49245092cf/images/img-0001.png" alt="$n$"/> notes that don’t contain a C is </p><table id="a0000000003">
<tbody><tr>
    
    <td> </td>
    <td><img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/acfe84d0716048a81bf4bd49245092cf/images/img-0005.png" alt="\[ \underbrace{12 \times 12 \times ... \times 12}_ n = 12^ n. \]"/></td>
    
    <td> </td>
    <td> </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><p>Which tells us that the number of sequences of <img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/acfe84d0716048a81bf4bd49245092cf/images/img-0001.png" alt="$n$"/> notes that do contain a C (the number of melodies) is </p><table id="a0000000004">
<tbody><tr>
    
    <td> </td>
    <td><img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/acfe84d0716048a81bf4bd49245092cf/images/img-0006.png" alt="\[ 13^ n - 12^ n. \]"/></td>
    
    <td> </td>
    <td> </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><p>We can even be more general and find the number of melodies for any scale. If the number of notes in the scale is <img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/acfe84d0716048a81bf4bd49245092cf/images/img-0007.png" alt="$s$"/> (so in our case <img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/acfe84d0716048a81bf4bd49245092cf/images/img-0008.png" alt="$s=13$"/>) then the number of melodies that contain <img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/acfe84d0716048a81bf4bd49245092cf/images/img-0001.png" alt="$n$"/> notes is </p><table id="a0000000005">
<tbody><tr>
    
    <td> </td>
    <td><img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/acfe84d0716048a81bf4bd49245092cf/images/img-0009.png" alt="\[ s^ n - (s-1)^ n. \]"/></td>
    
    <td> </td>
    <td> </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>But let’s return to our example with <img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/6da31d83122e968a6cd22e9df390c966/images/img-0001.png" alt="$s=13.$"/> Substituting ever larger numbers for <img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/6da31d83122e968a6cd22e9df390c966/images/img-0002.png" alt="$n$"/> — the length of the melody — gives us the following answer to our original question, the number of potential melodies within an octave: </p>


<table>
<tbody><tr><td><strong>Length of melody</strong></td><td><strong>No of possible melodies</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>25</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>469</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>7,825</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>122,461</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>ca. 1.84 million</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>ca. 26.9 million</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>ca. 385 million</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>ca. 5.4 billion</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>ca. 75 billion</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>So, a mere ten note melody will produce over 75 billion potential melodies of 13 notes within the octave! It&#39;s going to take our composer a while to work his way through those. A computer would find it easier — if anyone out there produces a program that cycles through all of them, then please let us know!</p>




<h3>Bring on the rhythm</h3>

<p>It would be nice to factor in rhythm as well, just to be completist, as very few melodies are sequences of exactly the same length of notes. </p>

<p>Luckily this is much easier to compute. Potentially note lengths can be anything between a <em>semiquaver</em> (a sixteenth note) and a <em>semibreve</em> (a whole note). (I&#39;m discounting <em>hemi-demi-semiquavers</em>!) Rather than include every single variation I think these would be a sensible selection of notes that would be available to use:</p>

<div><p><img src="https://plus.maths.org/content/sites/plus.maths.org/files/articles/2014/Oli/note_lengths.png" alt="Notes" width="470" height="341"/></p>
</div>

<p>This means there are 8 different possible lengths of a note, and each new note added to the sequence multiples the number of combinations by 8. for a sequence of <img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/54adc9db80a5110963026ccedd172483/images/img-0001.png" alt="$n$"/> notes the formula that counts the different rhythm variations is simply <img src="https://plus.maths.org/MI/54adc9db80a5110963026ccedd172483/images/img-0002.png" alt="$8^ n,$"/> which gives us the final calculation as below: </p>


<table>
<tbody><tr><td><strong>Length of melody</strong></td><td><strong>No of possible note combinations</strong></td><td><strong>Rhythm variations (ignoring melodies) = 8<sup>n</sup></strong></td><td><strong>Number of melodies (note combinations multiplied by rhythm variations</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>25</td><td>64</td><td>1600</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>469</td><td>512</td><td>240,128</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>7,825</td><td>4,096</td><td>32 million</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>122,461</td><td>32,768</td><td>4 billion</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>ca. 1.84 million</td><td>262,144</td><td>4.8 x 10<sup>11</sup></td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>ca. 26.9 million</td><td>ca. 2.1 million</td><td>ca. 5.6 x 10<sup>13</sup></td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>ca. 385 million</td><td>ca. 16.8 million</td><td>ca. 6.4 x 10<sup>15</sup></td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>ca. 5.4 billion</td><td>ca 1.3 x 10<sup>8</sup></td><td> ca. 7.02 x 10<sup>17</sup></td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>ca. 75 billion</td><td>ca. 1.1 x 10<sup>9</sup></td><td>ca. 8.25  x 10<sup>19</sup></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Or, for that final number:                                                                      
</p><p>There are  around 82,500,000,000,000,000,000 melodies that are 10 notes long.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a fair few to work through! A very rough approximation shows it&#39;s over 2.6 trillion years worth of material. 
And as mentioned at the start, this doesn&#39;t even begin to take into account the variations provided for by harmonisation, orchestration, tempo, or heavens above — bringing in a new counter melody!</p><p>So I think the message is: there is no excuse for writers&#39; block.
