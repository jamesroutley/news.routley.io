The style was popular in the 1960s to 1980s due to ability to maximize floor space with relatively cheap construction costs.<sup id="cite_ref-UBC_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-UBC-1">[1]</a></sup>

<p>Vancouver Specials were mass-produced between 1965 and 1985.<sup id="cite_ref-VHF_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-VHF-2">[2]</a></sup> However, there are examples of homes built in the late 1940s which share the characteristics of a Vancouver Special.<sup id="cite_ref-UBC_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-UBC-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>The houses were first built in southeast Vancouver in the early 1960s to serve newly arrived immigrants from Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> However, the mass production of the Vancouver Special is primarily attributed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asians_in_Vancouver" title="South Asians in Vancouver">South Asian community</a> after a wave of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s prompted many new immigrants to settle in the area and preside over the last large scale residential development in southeast Vancouver.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>In response to public reaction to the proliferation of this design, the City of Vancouver made changes to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_zoning" title="Single-family zoning">single-family zoning</a> regulations in the 1980s with the intent to stop additional Vancouver Specials from being built. However, other Lower Mainland cities have not substantially changed their housing codes over the past 25 years with respect to this kind of housing design. Thus, it is still possible to build (and buy) new houses (of very similar design to the classic Vancouver Specials) in the Lower Mainland.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>Vancouver Specials are front-gabled, 2-storey, boxy houses built on grade (i.e., without a raised foundation), with low-pitched roofs. They contain a shallow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcony" title="Balcony">balcony</a> on the second floor accessed by sliding glass doors. The front door is typically set to one side of the house, which allows for main living quarters on the upper floor and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_suites" title="Secondary suites">secondary suites</a> on the bottom. Ground level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facades" title="Facades">facades</a> are typically finished with brick or stone, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stucco" title="Stucco">stucco</a> at the higher levels.<sup id="cite_ref-VHF_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-VHF-2">[2]</a></sup>

<p>As the greater Vancouver area has not experienced a substantial earthquake (M ~6.5+) in the past 100 years, it is unclear how durable the Vancouver Special is to Seattle- or San Francisco-like earthquake land and soil movements. As there is a lot of built in modularity in this kind of housing design, it is assumed that relatively inexpensive earthquake remediation measures could be taken to increase this kind of housing architecture&#39;s ability to withstand earth movement without disintegration.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>Vancouver Specials evolved into what were frequently derided as &#34;monster homes&#34; in the 1990s that many critics claimed were ruining the aesthetic character of their neighbourhoods. However, the change in house size in the Greater Vancouver area is more closely bound to the rising house prices, and property speculation. Vancouver house prices had increased year-on-year more than many other similarly sized Canadian cities (and regions) in the previous 25 years.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2020)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p><p>In contrast to the earlier Vancouver Specials, monster homes were appearing in wealthier areas of the city, and critics were sometimes charged with being concerned as much about immigrants invading their exclusive neighbourhoods as they were about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a> of the neighbourhoods.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>The much maligned Vancouver Special, however, may yet see its bad reputation improve. Some indications include a locally produced music compilation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc" title="Compact disc">compact disc</a> in 2000, &#34;Vancouver Special,&#34; which features several examples of the house design on the cover, and a renovated Vancouver Special that won the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia&#39;s Innovation Award for Architecture in 2005.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>A home design store on Main Street bears the name &#34;Vancouver Special&#34; and Arsenal Pulp Press of Vancouver published <i>Vancouver Special</i>, a book of essays about the city by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Demers" title="Charles Demers">Charles Demers</a>, in November 2009, showing that the reputation of the homes may have now gained a certain vintage glamour.
