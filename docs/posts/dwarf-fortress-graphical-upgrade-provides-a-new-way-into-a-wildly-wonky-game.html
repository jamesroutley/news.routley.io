<p>After a long night of playing <em>Dwarf</em> <em>Fortress</em>, I had a concerned look on my face when I finally went to bed. My wife asked what was wrong. &#34;I think I actually want to keep playing this,&#34; I said. I felt a nagging concern for many weeknights to come.</p>
<p>Available tomorrow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370">Steam</a> and <a href="https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/dwarf-fortress">itch.io</a>, the new version of <i>Dwarf Fortress </i>updates the legendary (and legendarily arcane) colony-building roguelike with new pixel-art graphics, music, some (default) keyboard shortcuts, and a beginners&#39; tutorial. The commercial release aims to do two things: make the game somewhat more accessible and provide Tarn and Zach Adams, the brothers who maintained the game as a free download for 20 years, some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/16/unexpected-nudity-and-vomit-covered-cats-how-dwarf-fortress-tells-some-of-gamings-most-bizarre-stories">financial security</a>.</p>

<p>I know it has succeeded at its first job, and I suspect it will hit the second mark, too. I approached the game as a head-first review expedition into likely frustrating territory. Now I find myself distracted from writing about it because I keep thinking about my goblin defense and whether the fisherdwarf might be better assigned to gem crafting.</p>
<h2>Getting hooked</h2>
<p>Nearly 10 years ago, Ars&#39; Casey Johnston spent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/02/dwarf-fortress-ten-hours-with-the-most-inscrutable-video-game-of-all-time/">10 hours trying to burrow into <em>Dwarf Fortress</em></a> and came out more confused than before. The ASCII-based &#34;graphics&#34; played a significant role in her confusion, but so did the lack of any real onboarding, or even simple explanations or help menus about how things worked. Even after begrudgingly turning to <a href="https://www.dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Quickstart_guide">a beginners&#39; wiki</a>, Johnston found nothing but frustration:
</p><blockquote><p>Where’s the command to build a table? Which workshop is the mason&#39;s? How do I figure that out? Should I just build another mason’s workshop because that may be faster than trying to find the right menu to identify the mason’s workshop?</p></blockquote>
<p>In a few hours&#39; time—and similarly avoiding the wiki guide until I&#39;d tried going it alone for my first couple of runs—I got further into <em>Dwarf Fortress&#39; </em>systems than Johnston did with her 10-hour ordeal, and I likely enjoyed it a good deal more. Using the new tutorial modes&#39; initial placement suggestions and following its section-by-section cues, my first run taught me how to dig down, start a stockpile, assign some simple jobs, build a workshop, and—harkening back to Johnston&#39;s final frustrations—craft and place beds, bins, and tables, made with &#34;non-economic stone.&#34;</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/giant_badger_boar.jpg" data-height="1026" data-width="1246" alt="One of the badgers that terrorized an early settlement—and his surprisingly rich inner life."><img alt="One of the badgers that terrorized an early settlement—and his surprisingly rich inner life." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/giant_badger_boar-640x527.jpg" width="640" height="527" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/giant_badger_boar.jpg 2x"/></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/giant_badger_boar.jpg" data-height="1026" data-width="1246">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> One of the badgers that terrorized an early settlement—and his surprisingly rich inner life.</p><p>Kevin Purdy / Kitfox Games</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&#39;s about where the guidance ends, though. The new menus are certainly a lot easier to navigate than the traditional all-text, shortcut-heavy interface (though you can keep using multi-key combinations to craft and assign orders if you like). And the graphics certainly make it a lot easier to notice and address problems. Now, when an angry Giant Badger Boar kills your dogs and maims the one dwarf you have gathering plants outside, the threat actually <em>looks</em> like a badger, not a symbol you&#39;d accidentally type if you held down the Alt key. If you build a barrel, you get something that resembles a barrel, which is no small thing when you&#39;re just getting started in this arcane world.</p>
<p>The newly added music also helps soften the experience for newcomers. It&#39;s intermittent, unobtrusive, and quite lovely and evocative. It seems designed to stave off the eeriness of too much silent strategizing without overstaying its welcome. I can appreciate a game that graphically evokes the 16-bit era without the audio-cue exhaustion common to the JRPGs and simulations of the time.</p>

<p>However gentler the aesthetics and guidance for a newcomer, all the game&#39;s brutally tough and interlocking systems are intact in this update. These systems crunch together in weird and wild ways, fed by the landscape, your recent and long-ago actions, and random numbers behind the scenes.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>My first run ended in starvation and rock-bottom morale (&#34;hissy fits&#34; in common wiki language) because farming, butchering, and other procurements aren&#39;t covered in the tutorial. I shut down my second run early after picking a sandy area with an aquifer as a starting zone, thinking it would make glasswork and irrigation easier and being quickly disappointed with this strategy. I was proud on my third run to have started brewing and dispensing drinks (essential to dwarves&#39; contentment), but I dug too close to a nearby river, and I abandoned that soggy fort as yet another lesson learned.</p>
<p>But I&#39;ll be back. For me, the commercial release of <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> succeeded at transforming the game from a grim, time-killing in-joke for diehards into a viable, if not graceful, challenge. I will start again, I will keep the badgers and floods at bay, and next time, I might have the privilege of failing to a magma monster, an outbreak of disease, or even a miscarriage of dwarf justice.</p>
