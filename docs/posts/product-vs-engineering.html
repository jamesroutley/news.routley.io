    <h1>Product vs. Engineering</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><b>Friction Between Product and Engineering</b>; Lack of trust and
  collaboration slowing down product growth</p><div>
<p>The key to any successful startup is close collaboration between product
    and engineering. This sounds easy, but can be incredibly difficult. Both
    groups may have conflicting goals and different definitions of success that
    have to be reconciled. Engineering might want to build a product that is
    perfectly scalable for the future with the best developer experience.
    Product might want to quickly validate their ideas, and put features out
    that will entice customers to pay for the product. Another example that’s
    common to see is an engineering-led &#34;engineering roadmap&#34; and a product-led
    &#34;product roadmap&#34; and for the two to be completely independent of each
    other, leading to confusion for product engineering. These two mindsets 
    put two parts of your organization at odds. The easy path is to skip the
    difficult conversations and operate within silos, coming together
    infrequently to deliver a release. We believe that aligning these two
    disparate organizations into cohesive team units removes organizational
    friction and improves time to value.</p>

<section id="entry">
<h2>How did you get into the bottleneck?</h2>

<p>At the beginning of a startup’s journey, aligning is natural because
      you are a small team working closely together, and likely the product and
      tech leaders had close personal relationships before the company was
      founded. The initial startup idea is very strong and as it quickly gains
      traction, what to work on next is obvious to all groups. As the company
      grows, however, skill-based verticals begin to appear with more layers of
      management, and these managers don’t always put the effort in to create
      an effective working relationship with their peers. Instead, they focus on
      urgent tasks, like keeping the application running or preparing for a
      funding round. At the same time, the startup faces a critical juncture where the company needs to
      to decide how to best invest in the product, and needs a holistic
      strategy for doing so.</p>

<p>Well-run startups are already working in cross-functional product
      teams. Some functions will naturally work well together because they fall
      under the same vertical hierarchy. An example would be development and
      testing — well integrated in startups, but often siloed in traditional
      enterprise IT. However, in the scaleups we work with, we find that product
      and technical teams are quite separated. This happens when employees align
      more with their function in an <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ActivityOriented.html">Activity Oriented</a>
      organization rather than with an <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OutcomeOriented.html">Outcome Oriented</a> team, and it
      happens at every level: Product managers are not aligned with tech leads
      and engineering managers; directors not aligned with directors; VPs not
      aligned with VPs; CTOs not aligned with CPOs. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the bottleneck will be felt by reduced organizational
      performance as it chokes the creation of customer and business value.
      Startups will see it manifest in organizational tension, disruptive
      exceptions, unchecked technical debt, and velocity loss. Fortunately,
      there are some key signs to look for that indicate friction between your
      product and engineering organizations. In this article we will describe
      these signs, as well as solutions to lower the communication barriers,
      build a balanced investment portfolio, maximize return on investment, and
      minimize risk over the long term.</p>

<h2>Signs you are approaching a scaling bottleneck</h2>

<section id="FingerPointingAcrossFunctions">
<h3>Finger pointing across functions</h3>

<div id="hierarchical-communication.png"><p><img src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/hierarchical-communication.png"/></p><p>Figure 1: Friction across a typical
        hierarchical structure</p>
</div>



<p>Team members align themselves with their management structure or
        functional leadership as their primary identity, instead of their
        business or customer value stream, making it easier for teams to assume
        an “us” versus “them” posture.</p>

<p>At its worst the “us vs them” posture can become truly toxic, with little respect for each other.  We have seen this manifest when product leaders throw requirements over the wall, and treat the engineering team as a feature factory. They might abruptly cancel projects when the project doesn’t hit its outcomes, without any prior indication the project wasn’t meeting its KPIs. Or conversely, the engineering team continually lets down the product team by missing delivery dates, without warning that this might happen. The end outcome is both sides losing trust in each other. </p>
</section>

<section id="EngineersOftenStuckDueToLackOfProductContext">
<h3>Engineers often stuck due to lack of product context</h3>

<p>When product managers pass off features and requirements without reviewing them with the
        engineers (usually within the constructs of a tool like Jira), critical business and customer context can be lost. If
        engineers operate without context, then when design or
        development decisions need to be made, they must pause and track down the product
        manager, rather than make informed decisions themselves. Or worse, they made the decision anyway and
        build software based on an incorrect understanding of the product
        vision, causing time delays or unused software. This friction disrupts
        flow and introduces undue waste in your delivery value stream. </p>
</section>

<section id="MissedDependencies">
<h3>Missed dependencies</h3>

<p>When engineers and architects operate with minimal context, the full
        scope of a change can be overlooked or misunderstood. Requirements or
        user stories lack depth without context. Customer personas can be
        ignored, business rules not taken into consideration, technical
        integration points or cross-functional requirements missed. This
        often leads to last minute additions or unintended disruptions to the
        business or customer experience.</p>
</section>

<section id="WorkSlippingBetweenTheCracks">
<h3>Work slipping between the cracks </h3>

<p>Tasks slipping between the cracks, team members thinking someone else
        will be responsible for an activity, team members nudging each other out
        of the way because they think the other team member is operating in
        their space, or worse, team members saying “that’s not my job” – these
        are all signs of unclear roles and responsibilities, poor communication
        and collaboration, and friction.</p>
</section>

<section id="TechnicalDebtNegotiationBreakdown">
<h3>Technical debt negotiation breakdown</h3>

<p>Technical debt is a common byproduct of modern software development
        with many root causes that <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/01-tech-debt.html">we have
        discussed previously</a>. When product and engineering organizations
        aren’t communicating or collaborating effectively during product
        planning, we tend to see an imbalanced investment mix. This can mean the
        product backlog leans more heavily towards new feature development and
        not enough attention is directed toward paying down technical debt.</p>

<p>Examples include: </p>

<ul>
<li>Higher frequency of incidents and higher production support costs</li>

<li>Developer burnout through trying to churn out features while working
          around friction</li>

<li>An extensive feature list of low quality features that customers quickly
          abandon</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="TeamsCommunicatingButNotCollaborating">
<h3>Teams communicating but not collaborating </h3>

<p>Teams that meet regularly to discuss their work are communicating.
        Teams that openly seek and provide input while actively working are
        collaborating. Having regular status meetings where teams give updates
        on different components doesn’t mean a team is collaborative.
        Collaboration happens when teams actively try to understand each other
        and openly seek and provide input while working.</p>

<h2>How do you get out of the bottleneck?</h2>

<p>Eliminating the wall between Product and Engineering is essential to
      establishing high performing product teams. Cross-functional teams must
      communicate and collaborate effectively and they must be able to negotiate
      amongst themselves on how best to reach their goals. These are strategies
      Thoughtworks has applied to overcome this bottleneck when working with our
      scaleup clients.</p>

<section id="IdentifyAndReinforceYourx201cfirstTeamx201d">
<h3>Identify and reinforce your “First Team”</h3>

<p>At its most basic, a product team is a group of individuals who come
        together in a joint action around a common goal to create business and
        customer value. Each team contributes to that value creation in their own
        unique way or with their unique scope. As leaders, it’s important to identify
        and reinforce a team dynamic around the creation of value rather than an
        organizational reporting structure. This cross-functional product team becomes
        a team member’s “first team”. As a leader, when you define your team as your
        group of direct reports, you are enabling a tribal concept that contributes to
        an “us vs. them” dynamic. </p>

<p>The First Team mindset was defined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPXI2bPZTOo">by
        Patrick Lencioni</a> and referenced in many of his works including
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470941529/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470941529&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20">The Advantage</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787960756/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0787960756&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20">The Five Dysfunctions Of A Team: A Leadership
        Fable</a>, and while it’s typically used in relation with the
        establishment of cross-functional leadership teams as the primary
        accountability team rather than organizational reports, the same concept
        is applicable here for product teams.</p>

<p>Simply changing your organization&#39;s language, without changing its
        behaviors isn’t going to have a measurable impact on your scaling woes. Still,
        it&#39;s a simple place to start and it addresses the organizational friction and
        larger cultural issues that lie at the root of your performance issues.</p>

<section id="ChangingTheLanguage">
<h4>Changing the language</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The more hands-on an organization is willing to be in breaking
          silos, the more likely it is they will be effectively be breaking some
          of the implicit ‘versus’ states that have enabled them.</p>

<p>-- <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/duenablomstrom1/2019/02/06/why-a-culture-of-us-vs-them-is-deadly">Duena Blomstrom</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taking a hands-on approach to moderating the language
        used in your organization is a simple first step to breaking down
        barriers and reducing friction.</p>

<ul>
<li>Referring to your organizational group of practitioners as anything other
          than “team” – such as squad, pod, or whatever term fits your organization’s
          culture is a small change that can have a strong impact.</li>

<li>Naming your cross-functional product delivery teams,
          ideally with the name of their product or value stream, is another simple change that helps
          these multi-disciplined individuals adopt a new team identity separate from
          their organizational reporting context.</li>

<li>Drop “us” and “them” from the professional vocabulary. Coming up with
          alternative terms but keeping the same context of ‘that group over there - which
          isn’t this group’ is cheating. We filter ourselves and our language in a
          professional environment regularly and this language needs to be added to the
          ‘not allowed’ list.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="ChangeTheBehavior">
<h4>Change the behavior</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Those of us trying to
        change our organizations’ culture need to define the things we want to
        do, the ways we want to behave and want each other to behave, to provide
        training and then to do what is necessary to reinforce those behaviors.
        The culture will change as a result.</p>

<p>-- <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-change-a-culture-lessons-from-nummi/">John Shook</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Changing an organization’s culture when it isn’t delivering the desired
        results is hard. Many books have been written on the subject. By
        defining and communicating the expected behaviors of your teams and
        their respective team members up front, you set the underlying tone for
        the culture you are striving to create.</p>

<ul>
<li>Leaders should set a principle and expectation of a blameless culture. When
          something goes wrong, it’s a wonderful learning opportunity, to be studied and
          used to continuously improve. An example of this is the concept of
          a blameless post-mortem. </li>

<li>Set expectations and regularly inspect adoption of desired behaviors. Hold
          team members accountable to these behaviors and refuse to tolerate
          exceptions.</li>

<li>Orient “team” constructs around value streams instead of functions.
          Differentiate “teams” as groups who deliver common value from Communities of
          Practices or Centers of Excellence which are typically formed to deepen or
          deliver specific competencies such as Product Management or Quality
          Assurance.</li>

<li>Acknowledge that some personality types are less compatible than others.
          Shift talented people around to find the optimal team synergy.</li>

<section id="DefineAndCommunicateHowYourScaleupDeliversValue">
<h3>Define and communicate how your scaleup delivers value</h3>

<p>A company is, in many ways, just one large team with one shared goal
        — the success of the organization. When product and engineering don’t
        have a shared understanding of that goal, it’s hard for them to come to
        a collaborative agreement on how to achieve it. To avoid this source of
        friction, executives must clearly articulate and disseminate the overall
        value their organization provides to its customers, investors, and
        society. Leaders are responsible for describing how each product and
        service in your portfolio contributes to delivering that value.
        Management must ensure that every team member understands how the work
        that they do day in and day out creates value to the organization and
        its customers.</p>

<p>The goal is to create a shared mental model of how the business
        creates value. The best way to do this is highly dependent on the nature
        of your business. We have found certain kinds of assets to be both
        common and useful across our scaleup clients:</p>

<section id="AssetsThatDescribeCustomerAndUserValue">
<h4>Assets that describe customer and user value</h4>

<p>These should describe the value your product and services create, who
        they create it for, and the ways you measure that value. Examples
        include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Business Model Canvas/Lean Canvas</li>

<li>User Journeys</li>

<li>Service blueprints</li>

<li>Personas</li>

<li>Empathy maps</li>

<li>Storyboards</li>

<li>Job forces diagrams</li>

<li>Product overviews (one-pagers, etc)</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="AssetsThatDescribeYourEconomicModel">
<h4>Assets that describe your economic model</h4>

<p>These should describe the value your company receives from customers,
        the cost of creating that value, and the ways in which you measure that
        value. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Business flywheels</li>

<li>Value stream maps</li>

<li>Wardley maps</li>

<li>Retention/churn models</li>

<li>Customer acquisition models</li>

<li>Customer lifetime value models</li>

<li>Projected balance sheets and income
          statements </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="AssetsThatDescribeYourStrategy">
<h4>Assets that describe your strategy</h4>

<p>These should describe why you’ve chosen to serve these customers in
        this way, the evidence you used to make that decision, and the highest
        leverage ways you can increase the value you create and the value you
        receive in return.</p>

<ul>
<li>Target customer profiles</li>

<li>Issue trees</li>

<li>Impact maps</li>

<li>Opportunity/solution trees</li>

<li>Hierarchy diagrams</li>

<li>Causal loop diagrams</li>

<li>Other bespoke frameworks and models</li>
</ul>
</section>

<p>Once you have these assets, it’s important to constantly refer to
        them in presentations, in meetings, when making decsions, and most importantly,
        when there is conflict. Communicate when you change them,
        and what made you make those changes. Solicit updates from the
        organization. In short, make them part of your normal operations and
        don’t let them become wallpaper or another cubicle pinup. </p>

<p>A simple heuristic that we’ve found to understand how successful
        you’ve been in this communication is to pick a random individual
        contributor and ask them to answer the questions answered by these
        assets. The better they can do this without referring to the assets, the
        better they will be at incorporating this thinking into their work. If
        they don’t even know that the assets exist, then you still have a good
        deal of work to do. </p>

<p>The alignment and focus these assets create allow for better
        deployment of organizational resources, which enables scaling.
        Additionally, they redirect the natural tension between product and
        engineering. Instead of unproductive interpersonal friction, you can use
        creating and updating these assets as a venue for true collaboration and
        healthy disagreement about ideas that strengthen the company.</p>
</section>

<section id="CreateMultidisciplinaryStream-alignedTeams">
<h3>Create multidisciplinary stream-aligned teams</h3>

<p>When a company is just starting out, it often only has one value
        stream. But once it grows, it needs to break apart its products and
        services into multiple value streams so that individual teams can
        assume full ownership of various products or pieces of products. The
        best way to do this decomposition is beyond the scope of this article
        (we personally are big fans of <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/">Team Topologies</a> as a way to think
        through it), but some key things to consider are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Could this value stream and the products and services it comprises exist as
          a separate company (even if it wouldn’t be a highly successful one)?</li>

<li>Can you align your value streams to a specific way that your company creates
          value, or to a specific customer or user that the company creates value
          for?</li>

<li>How do your different value streams interact with each other?</li>
</ul>

<p>After defining your value streams, it’s time to bring
        multi-disciplined team members together around them — because value creation is a team sport. Ask the leaders
        of these value streams to create similar but more detailed versions of
        the assets we discussed above, and then determine what skills and
        capabilities are routinely needed to deliver and evolve the value of
        the product(s) and/or service(s) in the value streams from start to
        finish. </p>

<p> Pool those individuals together into an <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OutcomeOriented.html">Outcome Oriented</a>  team, rather
        than coordinating work across <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ActivityOriented.html">Activity Oriented</a> or functional teams. In
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0133903354/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0133903354&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20">Agile IT Organization Design</a>, Sriram Narayam
        states, “The more process and indirection there is, the greater the
        friction for effective collaboration. By contrast, people within a team
        don’t have to schedule meetings to collaborate with each other. They
        collaborate continuously and get into huddles (informal, ad hoc
        meetings—virtual or face to face) on demand.” While this model helps
        reduce latency within outcome-oriented team, it also reduces the
        friction among multidisciplinary team members.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that as your company grows, you may need to have
        “teams of teams”, with multiple teams aligned around one value stream
        and a team of cross-functional leaders for that value stream as well.
        As the complexity of your value creation increases, so too does the
        criticality of maintaining common purpose across your product delivery
        teams.</p>

<p>Product managers and software engineers have a shared
        responsibility to understand the needs of the customer so that they
        can define and prioritize the work. There isn’t an ideal mix of
        product people to engineers; every product is going to have a
        different ratio. The important part is to know that both are
        responsible for understanding, prioritizing and creating value.</p>

<p>As the product evolves, the needs of the team will evolve as well.
        Take regular inventory of the team&#39;s capabilities and empower the
        stream-aligned teams to advocate for their own needs. Ensure that the
        teams are fully resourced with the staff, skills, information, and
        authority to deliver efficiently without unnecessary dependencies on
        external resources. Fully sourced, empowered and autonomous product
        teams operating as a single entity, regardless of each individual’s
        reporting structure, dramatically reducing cross-discipline
        friction.</p>

<section id="EstablishTeamWorkingAgreementsAtAllLevels">
<h3>Establish team working agreements at all levels </h3>

<section id="EnsureEveryTeamMemberKnowsWhatRoleTheyx2019rePlaying">
<h4>Ensure every team member knows what role they’re playing</h4>

<p>The best teams are those that have negotiated the best ways of working for
          themselves. It’s important for organizations to have established sensible
          defaults to guide less mature teams on how to work effectively as a team. Even
          with established defaults, it&#39;s important that teams have autonomy to decide
          which member will take on which responsibilities. This measure of autonomy
          leads to greater accountability and a higher level of intrinsic motivation. As
          new teams form, codify this working agreement in the team&#39;s common knowledge
          repository. During retrospectives, revisit this team working agreement as the
          team learns more about each team member’s strengths and weaknesses and
          reassign the responsibilities accordingly. This team working agreement becomes
          both the social contract of the team, and also a unique &#34;responsibility
          fingerprint&#34; that no other team has. As new team members join or rotate
          through the team, having a referenceable team working agreement accelerates
          integration and reduces time to value during onboarding.</p>

<p>Team working agreements frequently contain:</p>

<ul>
<li>Team Name: What is the unique identifier for the team?</li>

<li>Team Mission: Why does this specific team exist? What value is it expected
            to deliver?</li>

<li>Team Metrics: How will the team measure success? Include value creation
            metrics, not just activity metrics.</li>

<li>Team Responsibilities: What work needs to be done to ensure success and
            which team members are agreeing to own those work items? <i>Organizations can seed
            this work with typical activities and recommendations for team responsibility
            allocations, but team members are free to renegotiate amongst themselves.</i></li>

<li>Team Skills: What skills are needed on this particular team to ensure
            success? </li>

<li>Team Norms: Guidelines, principles, ceremonies, and/or sensible defaults for
            team members to align on how team members are expected to behave, interact, and
            make decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Working agreements are a useful tool for cross functional teams,
          but they are also a great tool for aligning cross functional
          leaders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These three holistic view leaders—the head of product, the head
            of design, and the head of technology—are obviously very valuable
            individually, but in combination you can see their real power.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Executive leaders have a responsibility at a macro level to align
          on corporate and product strategies and the subsequent measures of
          success. If executives are not aligned on such measures as “desired
          investment mix across products”, teams expected to deliver to these
          measures are not being set up for success.</p>

<p>Functional line managers in a digital product organization may no
          longer direct the day to day efforts of the stream-aligned team - that
          responsibility falls to the team and the product manager on that team
          - but they still have tremendous value. Functional managers are
          responsible for ensuring that they are providing a healthy bench of
          skilled players to staff those teams. It’s critical that these direct
          managers are aligned on the roles and responsibilities of product team
          members to avoid conflict within the product teams.</p>
