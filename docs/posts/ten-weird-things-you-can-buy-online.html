<p>It’s <a href="https://www.aprilcools.club/">April Cools</a>! It’s like April Fools, except instead of cringe comedy you make genuine content that’s different from your normal stuff. For example, last year I talked about <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/microscopy/">owning a microscope</a>. This year I debated doing another hobby but settled on a much dumber topic.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen those <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/strange-things-amazon/">lists of weird things you can buy online</a>? It’s always just novelties and gag gifts. I’m much more interested in the weird things <em>with a legitimate use case</em>. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WTVQ171">Nicolas Cage throw pillow</a>? Just weird. Three pounds of live bees? Weird <em>and cool</em>.</p>

<p>Back in 2020, stuck inside and bored out of my mind, I decided to assemble my own Weird Thing list. My (loose) criteria were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not a one-off. It’s either something a merchant is selling on an ongoing basis or something with an active marketplace of buyers and sellers.</li>
<li>There’s an actual legitimate use. No gag gifts or collectors items.</li>
<li>There’s an actual price. It’s not “call for a quote”. If I have to call for a quote then I can’t just buy it on a whim.</li>
</ol>

<p>After I got a bunch I started a <a href="https://twitter.com/amazingwebdeals">gimmick Twitter account</a> to share them, then within two weeks discovered I hated running a gimmick Twitter account and shut it down. But I do like blogging, so here’s 10 weird things you can buy online and why you might want to.</p>

<h2 id="three-yards-of-books">Three Yards of Books</h2>

<p><a href="https://booksbythefoot.com/product/rainbow-ombre/"><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/weird-things-you-can-buy/img/books.jpg" alt=""/></a></p>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Merchant</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://booksbythefoot.com/">Books by the Foot</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Old books, $60/foot. Fiction books, $25/foot. <em>The Joy of Cooking</em>, $50/foot.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Two main clientele: clients who want filled bookshelves as part of their decor and filmmakers who need set dressing. These use cases are reflected in how they organize offerings: you can buy a specific genre, but also buy a specific binding style or color. My favorite detail is a bit of pricing: A foot of modern books are $10. Modern books <em>with all the racy stuff removed</em> is $20.</p>

<h2 id="human-milk">Human Milk</h2>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Market</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.breastfeedingmomsunite.com/">BreastfeedingMomsUnite</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Breast milk, usually around $1-2/oz</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> From the site:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This breast milk market will be of help to women who need to breastfeed their babies but cannot produce enough breast milk. Hence mothers who are willing to donate can help others who are having reduced supply of breast milk.</p>

<p>The government majorly regulates the trade of body fluids and organs (tissues, semen, blood, livers, and kidneys…), but not breast milk, thus donating, buying or selling breast milk is 100% legal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Yes there are creeps on the site too, but their ads are taken down p. quickly)</p>

<p>I really like how this is the perfect example of how marketplaces develop. Some women overproduce milk, some underproduce it, there’s an inefficiency in allocation, therefore market!</p>

<h2 id="a-life-size-animatronic-whale-shark">A life-size animatronic whale shark</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/product/10m-animatronic-whale-shark-for-sale/"><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/weird-things-you-can-buy/img/animatronic-whale-shark-2.jpg" alt="An animatronic whale shark"/></a></p>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Merchant</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/">My Dinosaurs Culture and Arts Co</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Life-size <a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/product/10m-animatronic-whale-shark-for-sale/">animal animatronics</a> and <a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/product/complete-t-rex-skeleton-for-sale/">skeletons</a>. Also for some reason, <a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/product/fiberglass-over-size-tea-cup-sculpture-for-sale/">giant teacups</a> and <a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/product/miniature-replica-landmarks-of-statue-of-liberty-2/">Statues of Liberty</a>. Price varies per item but it’s roughly mid thousands to low ten-thousands.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Theme parks and/or museums, depending on the product. There are more natural history museums in California than there are T-Rex fossils in the whole world. They claim all their skeletons are anatomically accurate.</p>

<p>If you’re in the market for nightmares, they also sell <a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/product/customized-realistic-silicone-animatronic-human-model/">animatronic people</a>.</p>

<h2 id="private-islands">Private Islands</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.privateislandsonline.com/caribbean/bahamas/the-exumas/darby-island"><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/weird-things-you-can-buy/img/island.jpg" alt="A large island."/></a></p>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Market</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.privateislandsonline.com/">Private Islands inc.</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Private islands. Surprisingly enough, there are plenty of islands that sell for under half a million dollars. Unsurprisingly, there are also islands that sell for a hundred million. Only one other product on this list comes <em>close</em> to those prices.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> I guess it’s like owning real estate, except the real estate is an entire island?  Billionaires use the internet too ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>I knew that some people owned private islands, but I didn’t expect there to be an online marketplace. Turns out it’s been around since 1999! They have a <a href="https://www.privateislandsonline.com/magazine-issues/pdf/pim-28-digital.pdf">magazine and everything</a>.</p>

<h2 id="uranium">Uranium</h2>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Merchant</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://unitednuclear.com">United Nuclear</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> <a href="https://unitednuclear.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=2_5">Radioactive Isotopes</a> for $100 each. You pick the isotope.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Calibrating scientific equipment and powering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber">cloud chambers</a>. The isotopes are small enough to be safe.</p>

<p>I looked to see if you could buy (tiny amounts of) weapons-grade uranium but unsurprisingly nobody’s offering that. I <em>did</em> find this <a href="https://measurlabs.com/">cool place</a> which does <a href="https://measurlabs.com/products/radiocarbon-dating/">radiocarbon dating</a> for $500 a sample.</p>

<p>Keeping on the topic of scientific research:</p>

<h2 id="chlamydia">Chlamydia</h2>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Merchant</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.atcc.org/products/vr-903">American Type Culture Collection</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> <a href="https://www.atcc.org/products/vr-903#generalinformation">Clamydia</a> for $1200. You can also buy COVID-19, tuberculosis, and <em>drug-resistant</em> tuberculosis. And, if you really want, you can buy a packet of brewer’s yeast for <a href="https://www.atcc.org/products/18824">$431</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Biomedical research. Unsurprisingly, you need a license to purchase anything. Still pretty neat that labs who need bioweapons can just go to a website and click “checkout”.</p>

<p>My favorite little bit is this section of the yeast quality control specifications:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>26S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence ATATCAATAAGCGGAGGAAAAGAAACCAACCGGGATTGCCTTAGTAACGGCGAGTGAAGCGGCAAAAGCTCAAATTTGAAATCTGGTACCTTCGGTGCCCGAGTTGTAATTTGGAGAGGGCAACTTTGGGGCCGTTCCTTGTCTATGTTCCTTGGAACAGGACGTCATAGAGGGTGAGAATCCCGTGTGGCGAGGAGTGCGGTTCTTTGTAAAGTGCCTTCGAAGAGTCGAGTTGTTTGGGAATGCAGCTCTAAGTGGGTGGTAAATTCCATCTAAAGCTAAATATTGGCGAGAGACCGATAGCGAACAAGTACAGTGATGGAAAGATGAAAAGAACTTTGAAAAGAGAGTGAAAAAGTACGTGAAATTGTTGAAAGGGAAGGGCATTTGATCAGACATGGTGTTTTGTGCCCTCTGCTCCTTGTGGGTAGGGGAATCTCGCATTTCACTGGGCCAGCATCAGTTTTGGTGGCAGGATAAATCCATAGGAATGTAGCTTGCCTCGGTAAGTATTATAGCCTGTGGGAATACTGCCAGCTGGGACTGAGGACTGCGACGTAAGTCAAGGATGCTGGCATAATGGTTATATGCCGCATT</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s just something really funny about the verification being “sequence it and make sure it’s got these 600 characters in a row.”</p>

<h2 id="live-bees">Live Bees</h2>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://mountainsweethoney.com/bees/">Mountain Sweet Honey Company</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Three pounds of bees for $144.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Apiaries! There are over <a href="https://honey.com/newsroom/presskit/honey-industry-facts">100,000 beekeepers</a> in the US and they all had to get their starter colonies from <em>somewhere</em>. It’s either buy the bees or buy a <a href="https://www.arbico-organics.com/product/bee-scent-attractant/pollination-aids">pint of bee pheromones</a> and attract them yourself.</p>

<p>Live bees are one of the few animals explicitly listed as shippable, under USPS postal code <a href="https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c5_008.htm">526 Mailable Live Animals</a> along with day-old chicks and live scorpions. But in general you can ship “small, harmless, cold-blooded animals”, so there’s a lot of business in selling insects. In particular, you can buy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/1500-Live-Ladybugs-Guaranteed-Delivery/dp/B00533KOIC">1500 ladybugs</a> for organic pest control and <a href="https://butterflyreleasecompany.com/Item/100-painted-lady-butterflies-for-release">100 butterflies</a> for wedding services.</p>

<p>For the record, the USPS explicitly considers all nonvenomous insects as “harmless”, which means you can ship</p>

<h2 id="bedbugs">Bedbugs</h2>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Seller</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.cheapbedbugs.com/product-page/6-month-subscription">https://www.cheapbedbugs.com/product-page/6-month-subscription</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> 600 bedbugs, $750.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> The fastest way to check a lot of places (say, a hotel) for bedbugs is with bedbug-sniffing dogs, and you’re trying to train bedbug-sniffing dogs, you need live samples of bedbugs to use for training. Hence, a live bedbug supplier.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the site is run by one guy and he wants a copy of your business license before selling you anything, so no buying bedbugs to torment your enemies. I dunno why but the tone of his <a href="https://www.cheapbedbugs.com/faq">FAQ</a> makes him seem more trustworthy.</p>

<h2 id="rollercoasters">Rollercoasters</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amusement-rides.com/en/product/g-force-maurer"><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/weird-things-you-can-buy/img/coaster.jpg" alt=""/></a></p>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Both</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.usedrides.com/">usedrides.com</a>, <a href="https://www.amusement-rides.com/en/services">amusement-rides</a>, <a href="https://amusementsupplyco.com/store/categories/New/">amusementsupplyco</a>. Lots more sellers but they’re all “contact for a quote” places.</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Anything you’d need for an amusement park. Food carts, kiddie rides, carousels, even <a href="https://www.amusement-rides.com/en/product/g-force-maurer">entire rollercoasters</a>. Prices vary.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> It makes sense when you think about it. There are over 400 permanent amusement parks in the US alone, not counting the thousands of county and state fairs. Most amusement parks have a static pool of attendees, and people crave novelty. A well-maintained carnival ride can last for <em>decades</em>. There’s plenty supply from parks trying to exchange rides and plenty demand from places trying to buy them, which means marketplaces.</p>

<p>I’m a little more surprised at how <em>many</em> sites I found. On some investigation, it seems this is driven by logistical concerns. Even small rides weigh <a href="https://www.majesticrides.com/quadzilla.html">10+ tons</a> and you’ll want to minimize transportation fees as much as possible. Different regions have different marketplaces.</p>

<h2 id="oil-tankers">Oil Tankers</h2>

<p><a href="https://horizonship.com/ship/228m-double-hull-lr-1-oil-chemical-tanker-imo-iii-73720-dwt-2008/?measure=2"><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/weird-things-you-can-buy/img/tanker.jpg" alt="A god-damn oil tanker"/></a></p>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Market</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://horizonship.com/ship-category/tankers-for-sale/crude-oil-tankers-for-sale/?sort=price&amp;sort_dir=DESC">Horizon Ship Brokers</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong>  Ships. Ships of all kinds. Cruise ships. Research vessels. Oil tankers. Anywhere from under a million to over 30 million.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> It’s insane to think that there’d be a secondhand market for <em>eight-hundred foot oil tankers</em>. This sent me down the <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/rmt2022_en.pdf">UN Maritime Transport Review</a> rabbit-hole, where I learned that in 2021 shipyards built the tonnage-equivalent of 1200 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aframax">Aframaxes</a> (pdf. 43). Nothing else made me realize just how unimaginably vast world trade is and just how much work goes into keeping the international supply chains running.</p>

<h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable mentions</h2>

<p>Some things that I are either interesting but not <em>that</em> surprising, or where I just don’t have much to say about them.</p>

<ul>
<li>I used to buy <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/ghirardelli-25-lb-queen-dark-chocolate-wafers/40863127.html">25 pound chocolate sacks</a> for small-scale chocolatiering.</li>
<li><a href="https://epson.com/For-Work/Printers/Large-Format/SureColor-F2100-Direct-to-Garment-Printer/p/SCF2100WE">T-shirt printers</a>: It’s a printer that takes t-shirts instead of paper! Also it costs $19,000</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Solution-Preserved-Plain-Pail/dp/B005N08FAO/">Pig fetuses</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Barn-Owl-Pellets-Large-Pack/dp/B00FGED110/ref=sr_1_4?crid=27IMXV4TI226A&amp;keywords=owl+pellets&amp;qid=1680203449&amp;sprefix=owl+pellets%2Caps%2C92&amp;sr=8-4">owl poop</a>: science classrooms</li>
<li>Can’t afford an oil tanker? Start small with buying a <a href="https://www.bizquest.com/buy-a-business-for-sale/search/">small business</a> or two.</li>
<li>Priceless cultural artifacts like <a href="https://www.artemission.com/">cuneiform tablets</a> do in fact have a price, and it’s usually in the mid hundreds to low thousands. The site <em>claims</em> they have provenance proof that all their wares come from before the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/27">Dealing in Cultural Objects Act</a> 2003 cutoff, but I don’t know how trustyworthy they are.</li>
<li>Several friends asked that I put in <a href="https://www.chemdirect.com/industry/other/deuterium-oxide/7789-20-0/2221">heavy water</a> and I value my friendships more than my integrity.</li>
</ul>
