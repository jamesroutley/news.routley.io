    <h1>Wi-fi signal tracks heartbeat without wearables</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="How Wi-Fi Signals Can Be Used to Detect Your Heartbeat"><div><p><em>This article is part of our exclusive <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/journal-watch/" target="_self">IEEE Journal Watch series</a> in partnership with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ieee-xplore" target="_self">IEEE Xplore</a>.</em></p><p><a data-linked-post="2666660456" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/wi-fi-7" target="_blank">Wi-Fi signals</a> today primarily transmit data. But these signals can also be used for other innovative purposes. For instance, one California-based team has proposed using ambient <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/wi-fi">Wi-Fi</a> signals to monitor a person’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/heart-rate">heart rate</a>. </p><p>The new approach, called Pulse-Fi, offers advantages over existing heart-rate-monitoring methods. It’s low-cost and easily deployable, and it sidesteps the need for people to strap a device to their body. </p><p><a href="https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=obraczka" target="_blank">Katia Obraczka</a> is a professor at the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, who led the development of Pulse-Fi. She notes that continuous tracking of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/vital-signs">vital signs</a>, including heat rate, can help flag health concerns such as stress, dehydration, cardiac disease, and other illnesses. “But using <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/wearables">wearables</a> to monitor vitals can be uncomfortable, have weak adherence, and have limited <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/accessibility">accessibility</a> due to cost,” she says. </p><p>Camera-based methods are one option for remote, contactless tracking of a person’s heart rate without a wearable device. However, these approaches may be compromised in poor lighting conditions and may also raise privacy concerns.</p><p>In the search for a better option, Obraczka, along with postdoc student Nayan Sanjay Bhatia and high-school intern Pranay Kocheta working in her lab, sought to create Pulse-Fi. “Pulse-Fi uses ordinary Wi-Fi signals to monitor your heartbeat without touching you. It captures tiny changes in the Wi-Fi signal waves caused by heartbeats,” says Obraczka.</p><h3>How Can Wi-Fi Signals Measure Someone’s Pulse? </h3><p>Specifically, the team designed Pulse-Fi to filter out background noise and detect the changes in signal amplitude brought about by heartbeats. They developed an <a data-linked-post="2671886754" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chain-of-thought-prompting" target="_blank">AI model</a>—capable of running on a simple computing device, such as a <a data-linked-post="2665855779" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/raspberry-pi-5" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>—which then reads the filtered signals and estimates heart rate in real time. </p><p>The team tested their approach in two different experiments, which are described in a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11096342" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in August at the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/11096125/proceeding" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2025 International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things</a>. </p><p>First, the researchers had seven volunteers sit in a chair at various distances of 1, 2, and 3 meters from two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32" target="_blank">ESP32 microcontrollers</a> that used Pulse-Fi to estimate the volunteers’ heart rates, comparing these data to heart-rate measurements taken by a pulse oximeter. In the second experiment, Pulse-Fi was used on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> devices to monitor the heart rates of more than 100 participants in different positions, including walking, running in place, sitting down, and standing up. </p><p>The results show that the system performs on par with other reference sensors, and Pulse-Fi’s less than 1.5-beats-per-minute error rate compares favorably to other vital-sign-monitoring technologies. Pulse-Fi also maintained sufficient accuracy despite the person’s posture (for example, sitting or walking) or distance from the recording device (up to 10 feet away). Based on these results, Obraczka says the team plans to establish a company to commercialize the technology. </p><p> <img alt="A woman scientist smiles in a conversation with her graduate student, as he explains the data being displayed on his laptop." data-rm-shortcode-id="c5f31186fd3df9d3e91bfc4a77dc95d8" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-scientist-smiles-in-a-conversation-with-her-graduate-student-as-he-explains-the-data-being-displayed-on-his-laptop.jpg?id=61696191&amp;width=980" height="2732" id="71fe9" lazy-loadable="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%204370%202732&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="4370"/> <small data-gramm="false" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-875874" placeholder="Add Photo Caption..." spellcheck="false">Prof. Katia Obraczka and her Ph.D. student Nayan Sanjay Bhatia—both of the University of California, Santa Cruz—discuss research on their Pulse-Fi technology, which remotely measures people’s pulse rates using Wi-Fi signals. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Erika Cardema/UC Santa Cruz</small></p><p>Obraczka adds that Pulse-Fi can work in new environments that its underlying AI model hadn’t trained for. “The model generalized well in [a new] setting, showing it’s not just memorizing, but actually learning patterns that transfer to new situations,” she says. </p><p>Obraczka also notes that the devices that Pulse-Fi runs on are affordable–with ESP32 chips costing about US $5 to $10, with Raspberry Pis costing about $30. </p><p><span>As yet, the researchers have tested Pulse-Fi on only a single user in the room at a time. The team is</span><span> now beginning to pilot the approach on multiple users simultaneously. “In addition to working on multiuser environments, we are also exploring other <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/wellness">wellness</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/health-care">health care</a> applications for Pulse-Fi,” Obraczka says, citing sleep apnea and breathing rates as examples.</span></p></div></div></div>
