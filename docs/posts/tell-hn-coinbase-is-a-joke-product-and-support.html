    <h1>Tell HN: Coinbase is a joke (product and support)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I work with Ukrainians and paying some of them has been a challenge, so we decided to give payment via BTC a try.  I got a personal Coinbase account to play around with it, to get more familiar (I had never purchase any crypto until then).  Once I got the account and proved to myself that it should work, I started the process to get a business account.</p><p>The business account took a long time to get.  Probably 2 months.  The amount of information they asked for was quite surprising to me.  As a founder, I had never given this level of detail to anyone for any purpose.  I assumed that it was due to regulations Coinbase were under, but honestly, I do not know.  The end goal was important enough that I was willing to go along.</p><p>Once I went through the onerous process, I linked our business checking and purchased some BTC and tried to transfer it.  I was told there would be a 13 day hold on the funds before they could be transferred to my consultant.  I went through support and was told to use a debit card and there would be no hold.</p><p>Since I didn&#39;t have a debit card, I had to get one.  After it came, I tried to add it and I got the error: An error occurred / Business cards are not supported.</p><p>That was in mid-December.  Here we are in late January and it is still not resolved.  Here&#39;s a thumbnail of what has happened in between:</p><p>- I submitted an email ticket, where they sent me canned responses for the first week or so.  They really never seem to understand the issue.</p><p>- After a few weeks they finally told me I had a personal account and I couldn&#39;t add a business debit card.</p><p>- I showed them screengrabs of my account proving that it was a business account.</p><p>At this point they ghosted me.</p><p>A week ago I tried a chat on the website.  I explained everything above and it came down to this:</p><p>&gt; A person can only have either a personal or business account, but not both</p><p>Let&#39;s ignore the fact that they let me open both accounts and never said a word about it.  They even let me connect a debit card to my personal account and a checking account to my business account.</p><p>Next, they told me if I deleted my personal account I could add the debit card to my business account.  I did that.  No change.</p><p>I started a chat again and after a long time bumped it up a level and said someone would get in touch with me via email.</p><p>Yesterday I got an email that my new ticket was closed and asked if my issue was resolved.</p><p>At this point, I deleted my personal account and my business account is stuck in &#34;personal&#34; mode and I can&#39;t add a debit card, so the hold time means it&#39;s useless.</p><p>I just want people to know that Coinbase is a complete joke of a company.  Don&#39;t use them.</p></div></div></div>
