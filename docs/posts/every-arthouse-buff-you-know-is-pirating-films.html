    <h1>Every Arthouse Buff You Know Is Pirating Films</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Earlier this year, Daniel, a filmmaker from England, wanted to watch Béla Tarr’s take on <em>Macbeth</em>, a TV movie by the <a href="https://i-d.co/article/krisztian-eder-april-breeze-photo-zine/" data-type="link" data-id="https://i-d.co/article/krisztian-eder-april-breeze-photo-zine/">Hungarian</a> auteur that had aired in 1982 on the Magyar Televízió network. On <a href="https://i-d.co/article/arthouse-cannibal-movies/" data-type="link" data-id="https://i-d.co/article/arthouse-cannibal-movies/">arthouse</a> subreddits like /<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscureMedia/comments/ao6f3x/macbeth_1982_a_hungarian_tv_movie_adaptation_by/">ObscureMedia</a> and /<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/criterion/comments/ku779v/does_anyone_here_know_where_i_can_watch_b%C3%A9la/">Criterion</a>, the film had become the subject of intrigue. It’s composed of just two takes, the first five minutes long, the second 57 minutes. The famous three witches are all played by men. </p>

<p>Pre-2010 arthouse is even more scarce. The transition from physical media to streaming in the late 00s led to the quiet loss of a slew of films that had previously been available from specialist companies like Tartan, Artificial Eye <em>et al.</em> Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s <em>Blissfully Yours</em> won the <a href="https://i-d.co/article/photos-cannes-film-festival-francesc-planes-gonzo-glamour-debauchery/">Cannes Film Festival</a>’s Un Certain Regard prize back in 2002 and is not legally viewable anywhere. Federico Fellini’s rare circus documentary <em>I Clowns</em> (1970) was re-released a decade ago, only for its distribution deal to expire<em>. The Falls</em> (1980), the abstract three-hour debut movie of Peter Greenaway, known best for <em>The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover</em> (1989), has fallen into the abyss. </p>

<p>Waters‘ early work, so salacious it has routinely been destroyed by the censorship boards asked to grade it, has become arthouse catnip: films that young cinephiles once had to scourge for on shared VHS tapes are now find on digital clouds and drives. Films like <em>Eat Your Makeup </em>(1968), his 16mm comedy about a kidnapping nanny, and his Divine-starring short <em>The Diane Linkletter Story </em>(1970), have never been officially released, but have found cult audiences online via pirated streams. The source? “Don’t ask me!” he says.</p>
