They said the calls for violence against Russian soldiers were allowed because this was being used as a proxy for the Russian military, and said it would not apply to prisoners of war.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">The temporary policy changes apply to Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Russia and Ukraine.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Last week, Russia said it was banning Facebook in the country in response to what it said were restrictions of access to Russian media on the platform. Moscow has cracked down on tech companies, including Twitter<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TWTR.N" target="_blank">(TWTR.N)</a>, which said it is restricted in the country, during its invasion of Ukraine, which it calls a &#34;special operation.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Many major social media platforms have announced new content restrictions around the conflict, including blocking Russian state media RT and Sputnik in Europe, and have demonstrated carve-outs in some of their policies during the war.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Emails also showed that Meta would allow praise of the right-wing Azov battalion, which is normally prohibited, in a change first reported by The Intercept.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Meta spokesman Joe Osborne previously said the company was &#34;for the time being, making a narrow exception for praise of the Azov Regiment strictly in the context of defending Ukraine, or in their role as part of the Ukraine National Guard.&#34;</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in New Delhi and Elizabeth Culliford in New York; editing by Kenneth Li and Jonathan Oatis</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
