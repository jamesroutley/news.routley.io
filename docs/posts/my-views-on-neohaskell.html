<p>Recently <a href="https://github.com/NickSeagull">Nick Seagull</a>
has <a href="https://dev.to/neohaskell/introducing-neohaskell-a-beacon-of-joy-in-a-greyed-tech-world-4f9b">announced</a>
a <a href="https://neohaskell.org/">NeoHaskell</a> project which (I
believe) has generated some controversy. My first run-in with NeoHaskell
was <a href="https://cohost.org/ratherforky/post/2952574-utterly-overwhelmed">this
post on cohost</a> criticizing the NeoHaskell project and a few of my
friends within the Haskell community have expressed concern about the
NeoHaskell project. My gut reaction is also critical, but I wanted to do
a more thorough investigation before speaking publicly against
NeoHaskell so I figured I would dig into the project more first. Who
knows, maybe my gut reaction is wrong? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
<p>Another reason NeoHaskell is relevant to me is that I think a lot
about marketing and product management for the Haskell community, and
even presented a talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNpsgTIpODA">How to market Haskell
mainstream programmers</a> so I‚Äôm particularly keen to study NeoHaskell
through that lens to see if he is trying to approach things in a similar
way or not.</p>
<p>I also have credentials to burnish in this regard. I have a lot of
experience with product management and technical product management for
open source projects via my work on Dhall. Not only did I author the
original implementation of Dhall but I singlehandedly built most of the
language ecosystem (including the language standard, documentation,
numerous language bindings, and the command-line tooling) and mentored
others to do the same.</p>
<p>Anyway, with that out of the way, on to NeoHaskell:</p>
<h3 id="what-is-neohaskell">What is NeoHaskell?</h3>
<p>I feel like this is probably the most important question to answer
because unless there is a clear statement of purpose for a project
there‚Äôs nothing to judge; it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot even wrong‚Äù because there‚Äôs no
yardstick by which to measure it and nothing to challenge.</p>
<p>So what <em>is</em> NeoHaskell?</p>
<p>I‚Äôll break this into two parts: what NeoHaskell is <em>right now</em>
and what NeoHaskell aspires to be.</p>
<p>Based on what I‚Äôve gathered, <em>right now</em> NeoHaskell is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A set of user experience requirements</p>
<p>‚Ä¶ tracked as <a href="https://github.com/neohaskell/NeoHaskell/issues">issues in this
GitHub repository</a></p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="https://neohaskell.org/">website</a></p>
<p>‚Ä¶ which informally summarizes some of the headline requirements (such
as Python interop and mobile support)</p></li>
<li><p>An <a href="https://dev.to/neohaskell/introducing-neohaskell-a-beacon-of-joy-in-a-greyed-tech-world-4f9b">announcement
post</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, it‚Äôs not clear what NeoHaskell aspires to be from studying
the website, the issue tracker, or announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is this going to be a new programming language inspired by
Haskell?</p>
<p>In other words, will this be a ‚Äúclean room‚Äù implementation of a
language which is Haskell-like?</p></li>
<li><p>‚Ä¶ or this going to be a fork of Haskell (more specifically:
<code>ghc</code>) to add the desired features?</p>
<p>In other words, will the relationship of NeoHaskell to Haskell be
similar to the relationship between NeoVim and Vim? (The name seems to
suggest as much)</p></li>
<li><p>‚Ä¶ or this going to be changes to the command-line Haskell
tooling?</p>
<p>In other words, will this be kind of like <code>stack</code> and
promote a new suite of tools for doing Haskell development?</p></li>
<li><p>‚Ä¶ or this going to be improvements to the Haskell package
ecosystem?</p>
<p>In other words, will this shore up and/or revive some existing
packages within the Haskell ecosystem?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here‚Äôs what I <strong>think</strong> NeoHaskell aspires to be based
on carefully reading through the website and all of the issues in the
issue tracker and drawing (I believe) reasonable inferences:</p>
<p>NeoHaskell is not going to be a fork of <code>ghc</code> and is
instead proposing to implement the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new command-line tool (<code>neo</code>) similar in spirit to
<code>stack</code>
<ul>
<li>It is proposing some new features not present in <code>stack</code>
but it reads to me as similar to <code>stack</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A GHC plugin that would add:
<ul>
<li>new language features (none proposed so far, but it aims to be a
Haskell dialect)</li>
<li>improved error messages</li>
<li>some improvements to the UX (e.g.¬†automatic hole filling)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An attempt to revive the work on a mobile (ARM) backend for
Haskell</li>
<li>An overhaul of Haskell‚Äôs standard libraries similar in spirit to
<code>foundation</code></li>
<li><code>TemplateHaskell</code> support for the <code>cpython</code>
package for more ergonomic Python interop</li>
<li>A set of documentation for the language and some parts of the
ecosystem</li>
<li>An event sourcing framework
<ul>
<li>‚Ä¶ and a set of template applications based on that framework</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>And in addition to that concrete roadmap Nick Seagull is essentially
proposing the following governance model for the NeoHaskell project (and
possibly the broader Haskell ecosystem if NeoHaskell gains
traction):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Centralizing product management in himself as a benevolent
dictator</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm exaggerating this. Here is the relevant excerpt
from the announcement post, which explicitly references the BDFL
model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that in order for a product to be successful, the design
process <strong>must be centralized in a single person.</strong> This
person must listen to the users, the other designers, and in general
must have an open mind to always cherry-pick all possible ideas in order
to improve the product. <strong>I don‚Äôt believe that a product should be
guided by democracy</strong>, and neither it should implement all
suggestions by every user. In other words, I‚Äôll be the one in charge of
generating and listening to discussions, and prioritizing the features
of the project.</p>
<p><strong>I understand that this comes with some risk</strong>, but at
the same time I believe that all programming tools like Python and Ruby
that are very loved by their communities are like that because of the
BDFL model</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Organizing work via the NeoHaskell discord and NeoHaskell GitHub
issue tracker</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I feel like it should have been easier to gather this concrete
information about NeoHaskell‚Äôs aspirational goals, if only so that the
project is less about vibes and more a discussion on a concrete
roadmap.</p>
<p>Alright, so now I‚Äôll explain my general impression of this project.
I‚Äôll start with the positive feedback followed by the negative feedback
and I‚Äôll be a bit less reserved and more emotionally honest in my
feedback.</p>
<h3 id="positive-feedback">Positive feedback</h3>
<h4 id="welcome-contributions">Welcome contributions</h4>
<p>I‚Äôm not the kind of person who will turn down someone willing to do
work to make things better as long as they don‚Äôt make things worse. A
new mobile backend for Haskell sounds great! Python interop using
<code>TemplateHaskell</code> sounds nice! Documentation? Love it!</p>
<h4 id="a-ghc-plugin-is-a-good-approach">A GHC plugin is a good
approach</h4>
<p>I think the approach of implementing this as a GHC plugin is a much
better idea than forking <code>ghc</code>. This sidesteps the ludicrous
amount of work that would be required to maintain a fork of
<code>ghc</code>.</p>
<p>Moreover, implementing any Haskell dialect as a GHC plugin actually
minimizes ecosystem fragmentation because (similar to an alternate
Prelude) it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúleak‚Äù. If one of your dependencies uses a GHC
plugin for the NeoHaskell dialect then your package doesn‚Äôt have to use
that same dialect (you can still build that dependency and code your
package in non-Neo Haskell). <code>cabal</code> can handle that sort of
thing transparently.</p>
<h4 id="haskell-does-need-better-product-management">Haskell does need
better product management</h4>
<p>I think the <a href="https://haskell.foundation/">Haskell
foundation</a> was supposed to be this (I could be wrong) but that
didn‚Äôt really seem to pan out.</p>
<p>Either way, I think a lot of us know what good product management is
and it is strikingly absent from the ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="negative-feedback">Negative feedback</h3>
<h4 id="benevolent-dictator">Benevolent dictator</h4>
<p>I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that someone who hasn‚Äôt made significant
contributions to the Haskell ecosystem wants to become a benevolent
dictator for a project aspiring to make an outsized impact on the
Haskell ecosystem. I know that this is harsh and a personal attack on
Nick and I‚Äôm also mindful that there‚Äôs a real person behind the avatar.
<strong>HOWEVER,</strong> when you propose to be a benevolent dictator
you are inherently <em>making things personal</em>. A proposal to become
a benevolent dictator is essentially a referendum on you as a person.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>And it‚Äôs not just a matter of fairness or whatever. Nick‚Äôs lack of
Haskell credentials directly impact his ability to actually meaningfully
improve upon prior art if he doesn‚Äôt understand the current state of the
art. Like, when Michael Snoyman created <code>stack</code> it did lead
to a lot of fragmentation in the Haskell tooling but at least I felt
like he was justified in his attempt because he had an impressive track
record and a deep understanding of the Haskell ecosystem and
toolchain.</p>
<p>I do not get anything remotely resembling that impression from Nick
Seagull. He strikes me as a dilettante in this area and not just due to
his lack of Haskell credentials but also due to some of his questionable
proposed changes. This brings me to:</p>
<h4 id="unwelcome-contributions">Unwelcome contributions</h4>
<p>Not all contributions benefit the ecosystem<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. I
think proposing a new <code>neo</code> build tool is likely to fragment
the tooling in a way similar to <code>stack</code>. I have worked pretty
extensively with all three of <code>cabal</code>, <code>stack</code> and
Nix throughout my career and my intuition based on that experience is
that the only improvement to the Haskell command-line experience that is
viable and that will ‚Äúwin‚Äù in the long run is one that is directly
upstreamed into <code>cabal</code>. It‚Äôs just that nobody wants to do
that because it‚Äôs not as glamorous as writing your own build tool.</p>
<p>Similarly, I think his proposed vision of ‚Äúevent source all the
Haskell applications‚Äù (including <a href="https://github.com/neohaskell/NeoHaskell/issues/39">command-line
scripts</a>) is poorly thought out. I firmly subscribe to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power">principle of
least power</a> which says that you should use the simplest type or
abstraction available that gets the job done instead of trying to
shoehorn everything into the same ‚Äúgod type‚Äù or ‚Äúgod abstraction‚Äù. I
learned this the hard way when I tried to shoehorn everything into my <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes"><code>pipes</code></a>
package and realized that it was a huge mistake, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm
innocent in this regard. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did.</p>
<p>And it <em>matters</em> that some of these proposed changes are
counterproductive because if he indeed plays a role as a benevolent
dictator you‚Äôre not going to get to pick and choose which changes to
keep and which changes to ignore. You‚Äôre getting the whole package, like
it or not.</p>
<h4 id="not-good-product-management">Not good product management</h4>
<p>I don‚Äôt believe NeoHaskell is the good product management we‚Äôre all
looking for. ‚ÄúHaskell dialect + python interop + event sourcing + mobile
backend‚Äù is not a product. It‚Äôs an odd bundle of features that don‚Äôt
have a clear market or vertical or use case to constrain the design and
navigate tradeoffs. The NeoHaskell roadmap comes across to me as a grab
bag of unrelated features which individually sound good but that is not
necessarily good product management.</p>
<p>To make this concrete: what is the purpose of bundling both python
interop and a mobile backend into NeoHaskell‚Äôs roadmap? As far as I know
there is no product vertical that requires both of those things.</p>
<h4 id="the-overall-vibe-is-bad">The overall vibe is bad</h4>
<p>My initial impression of NeoHaskell was that it struck me as
bullshit. Carefully note that I‚Äôm not saying that Nick is a bullshitter,
but if he wants to be taken seriously then he needs to rethink how he
presents his ideas. Everything from the tone of the announcement post
(including the irrelevant AI-generated images), the complete absence of
any supporting code or mockups, and the wishy washy statement of purpose
all contributed to the non-serious vibes.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Anyway, I don‚Äôt hate Nick and I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôd get along with him
great in person in other contexts. He also seems like a decently
accomplished guy in other respects. However, I think nominating himself
as a benevolent dictator for an ambitious ecosystem is a bit
irresponsible. However, we all make mistakes and can learn from
them.</p>
<p>And I don‚Äôt endorse NeoHaskell. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any more likely to
succeed than Haskell absent some better product management. ‚ÄúI like
simple Haskell tailored to blue collar engineers‚Äù is a nice vibe but
it‚Äôs not a product.</p>
