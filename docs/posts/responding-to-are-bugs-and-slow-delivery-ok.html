    <h1>Responding to “Are bugs and slow delivery ok?”</h1>

<p>A few days ago I came across a blog post, by Valentina Cupać, titled <a href="https://journal.optivem.com/p/are-bugs-and-slow-delivery-ok">“Are bugs and slow delivery ok?”</a>.</p>



<p>The title itself was enough to irritate me. What do you mean? That’s been an answered question for decades! Surely this is nothing more then clickbait.</p>



<p>Reading through the post, my irritation grew into real anger.</p>



<p>Based on her experience, most companies can afford to ship buggy products, slowly. </p>



<p>As a proponent of such noble ideas as TDD, trunk-based development, refactoring, etc, you can see why Cupać’s ideas would be hateful to me. It’s the exact opposite of everything I believe in!</p>



<p>But there was one thing that I hated most about her blog post:</p>



<p>She was right.</p>







<p>Cupać says that she came to her conclusion based on her personal experience.</p>



<p>I’ve seen (and wrote) some terrible quality code. Really bad stuff. Untested, most of it. </p>



<p>You know what I haven’t seen? not once in 15 years?</p>



<p>I’ve seen expensive and unnecessary re-writes, once technical bankruptcy was inevitably declared.</p>



<p>But none of that caused these companies to go out of business.</p>



<p>And why is that? </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Software doesn’t make or break an organization. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Even a software organization.</p>



<p>There are many ways for software products to survive, and many of them don’t depend on quality:</p>



<p>Some software is built for an internal audience, who are captive customers. They have to accept whatever sh*t we developers deliver to them.</p>



<p>Once I woke up to the truth Cupać’s arguments, I realised that I was the victim of dogmatic thinking.</p>







<p>That’s not to say that I now think that “High quality good! Low quality better!”.</p>



<p>I now arrived at a more refined view of technical quality. Where high quality is nice to have, but is not the be-all-and-end-all.</p>



<p>Up until now, I assumed that every organization should aspire to high quality of software delivery. And if they don’t have that currently – then surely they’re working towards it.</p>



<p>This new insight will fundamentally change the way I view software organizations.</p>



<p>So thank you, Valentina, for your thought-provoking post. </p>
