<hr/>
<p dir="auto">The goal of this project is to: <strong>create a programming language capable of making formal verification and provably correct software practical and mainstream</strong>. The language and its surrounding education/tooling ecosystem should provide a foundation strong enough to create verified software for any system or environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">Software is an increasingly critical component of our society, underpinning almost everything we do. It&#39;s also extremely vulnerable and unreliable. Software vulnerabilities and errors have likely caused humanity <a href="https://www.it-cisq.org/pdf/CPSQ-2020-report.pdf" rel="nofollow">trillions of dollars</a> in damage, <a href="https://findstack.com/hacking-statistics/" rel="nofollow">social harm</a>, waste, and <a href="https://raygun.com/blog/cost-of-software-errors/" rel="nofollow">lost growth opportunity</a> in the digital age (it seems clear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions" rel="nofollow">Tony Hoare&#39;s estimate</a> is way too conservative, especially if you include more than <code>null</code> errors).</p>
<p dir="auto">What would it look like if it was both possible and tractable for working software engineers to build and deploy software that was <em>provably correct</em>? Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant" rel="nofollow">proof assistant languages</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq" rel="nofollow">Coq</a> it&#39;s possible to define logical assertions as code, and then write proofs of those assertions that can be automatically checked for consistency and correctness. Systems like this are extremely powerful, but have only been suited for niche academic applications until the fairly recent invention of <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.ohearn/papers/Marktoberdorf11LectureNotes.pdf" rel="nofollow">separation logic</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Separation logic isn&#39;t a tool, but a paradigm for making logical assertions about mutable and destructible state. The Rust ownership system was directly inspired by separation logic, which shows us that it really can be used to unlock revolutionary levels of productivity and excitement. Separation logic makes it possible to verify things about practical imperative code, rather than simply outlawing mutation and side effects as is done in functional languages.</p>
<p dir="auto">However Rust only exposes a simplified subset of separation logic, rather than exposing the full power of the paradigm. <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/papers/iris-ground-up/paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Iris separation logic</a> was recently created by a team of academics to fully verify the correctness of the Rust type system and several core implementations that use <code>unsafe</code>. Iris is a fully powered separation logic, making it uniquely capable of verifying the kind of complex, concurrent, arbitrarily flexible assertions that could be implied by practical Rust code, even those that use <code>unsafe</code>. Iris could be used to do the same for any other practical and realistic language.</p>
<p dir="auto">Isn&#39;t that amazing?! A system that can prove completely and eternally that a use of <code>unsafe</code> isn&#39;t actually unsafe??!! You&#39;d think the entire Rust and systems programming community would be over the moon!!?</p>
<p dir="auto">But as always happens with academia, it&#39;s only being used to write papers rather than creating tools to apply it to real software. All the existing uses of Iris perform the proofs &#34;on the side&#34; using transcribed syntax tree versions of the target code rather than directly reading the original source. And although the papers are more approachable than most academic papers, they&#39;re still academic papers, and so basically no working engineers have even heard of any of this.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is why I&#39;m building Magmide, which is intended to be to both Coq and LLVM what Rust has been to C. There are quite a few proof languages capable of proving logical assertions in code, but none exist that are specifically designed to be used by working engineers to build real imperative programs. None have placed a full separation logic, particularly one as powerful as Iris, at the heart of their design, but instead are overly dogmatic about the pure functional paradigm. None make it possible to type-check, prove assertions about, and compile practical programs all using one unified tool. And all existing proof languages are hopelessly mired in the obtuse and unapproachable fog of <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/" rel="nofollow">research debt</a> created by the culture of academia. Even if formal verification is already capable of producing <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/formal-verification-creates-hacker-proof-code-20160920/" rel="nofollow">provably safe and secure code</a>, it isn&#39;t good enough if only professors have the time to gain the necessary expertise. We need to pull all this amazing knowledge out of the ivory tower and finally put it to work to make computing truly safe and robust.</p>
<p dir="auto">I strongly believe a world with mainstream formal verification would not only see a significant improvement in <em>magnitude</em> of social good produced by software, but a significant improvement in <em>kind</em> of social good. In the same way that Rust gave engineers much more capability to safely compose pieces of software therefore enabling them to confidently build much more ambitious systems, a language that gives them the ability to automatically check arbitrary conditions will make safe composition and ambitious design arbitrarily easier to do correctly.</p>
<p dir="auto">What kinds of ambitious software projects have been conceived but not pursued because getting them working would simply be too difficult? With machine checkable proofs in many more hands could we finally build <em>truly secure</em> operating systems, trustless networks, or electronic voting methods? How many people could be making previously unimagined contributions to computer science, mathematics, and even other logical fields such as economics and philosophy if only they had approachable tools to do so? I speculate about some possibilities at the end of this readme.</p>
<p dir="auto">Read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/magmide/magmide/blob/main/posts/design-of-magmide.md"><code>posts/design-of-magmide.md</code></a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/magmide/magmide/blob/main/posts/comparisons-with-other-projects.md"><code>posts/comparisons-with-other-projects.md</code></a> to more deeply understand how Magmide is designed and how it&#39;s different than other projects.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is a huge goal, and a language capable of achieving it must have all these qualities:</p>

<p dir="auto">In order to really deliver the kind of truly transformative correctness guarantees that will inspire working engineers to learn and use a difficult new language, it doesn&#39;t make sense to stop short and only give them an &#34;easy mode&#34; verification tool. It should be possible to formalize and attempt to prove any proposition humanity is capable of representing logically, not only those that a fully automated tool like an <a href="https://liquid.kosmikus.org/01-intro.html" rel="nofollow">SMT solver</a> can figure out. A language with full logical expressiveness and manual proofs can still use convenient automation as well, but the opposite isn&#39;t true.</p>
<p dir="auto">To achieve this goal, the language will be fully <strong>dependently typed</strong> and use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_constructions" rel="nofollow">Calculus of Constructions</a> much like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq" rel="nofollow">Coq</a>. I find <a href="http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/html/Cpdt.Intro.html" rel="nofollow">Adam Chlipala&#39;s &#34;Why Coq?&#34;</a> arguments convincing in regard to this choice. Coq will also be used to bootstrap the first version of the compiler, allowing it to be self-hosting and even self-verifying using a minimally small trusted theory base. Read more about the design and bootstrapping plan in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/magmide/magmide/blob/main/posts/design-of-magmide.md"><code>posts/design-of-magmide.md</code></a>. The <a href="https://github.com/MetaCoq/metacoq">metacoq</a> and <a href="https://metacoq.github.io/coqcoqcorrect" rel="nofollow">&#34;Coq Coq Correct!&#34;</a> projects have already done the work of formalizing and verifying Coq using Coq, so they will be very helpful.</p>
<p dir="auto">It&#39;s absolutely possible for mainstream engineers to learn and use these powerful logical concepts. The core ideas of formal verification (dependent types, proof objects, higher order logic, separation logic) aren&#39;t actually that complicated. They just haven&#39;t ever been properly explained because of <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/" rel="nofollow">research debt</a>, and they weren&#39;t even all that practical before separation logic and Iris. I&#39;ve been working on better explanations in the (extremely rough and early) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/magmide/magmide/blob/main/posts/intro-verification-logic-in-magmide.md"><code>posts/intro-verification-logic-in-magmide.md</code></a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/magmide/magmide/blob/main/posts/coq-for-engineers.md"><code>posts/coq-for-engineers.md</code></a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Software needs to perform well! Not all software has the same requirements, but often performance is intrinsically tied to correct execution. Very often the software that most importantly needs to be correct also most importantly needs to perform well. If the language is capable of truly bare metal performance, it can still choose to create easy abstractions that sacrifice performance where that makes sense.</p>
<p dir="auto">To achieve this goal, the language will include in its core libraries a formalization of the basic principles of von Neumann computation, allowing users to specify the axiomatic assumptions of any software execution environment, from concrete instruction set architectures, to any <strong>abstract assembly language</strong> such as LLVM capable of compiling to many targets, and even up to operating system userlands or bytecode environments such as WebAssembly. Making it possible to specify software at this level of fidelity helps ensure it is aligned with reality and isn&#39;t making unrealistic assumptions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because of separation logic and Iris, it is finally possible to verify code at this extremely granular level.</p>
<h2 dir="auto"><a id="user-content-gradually-verifiable" aria-hidden="true" href="#gradually-verifiable"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a>Gradually verifiable</h2>
<p dir="auto">Just because it&#39;s <em>possible</em> to fully verify all code, doesn&#39;t mean it should be <em>required</em>. It simply isn&#39;t practical to try to completely rewrite a legacy system in order to verify it. Successful languages with goals of increased rigor such as Rust and Typescript strategically use concessions in the language such as <code>unsafe</code> and <code>any</code> to allow more rigorous code to coexist with legacy code as it&#39;s incrementally replaced. The only problem is that these concessions introduce genuine soundness gaps into the language, and it&#39;s often difficult or impossible to really understand how exposed your program is to these safety gaps.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can get both practical incremental adoption and complete understanding of the current safety of our program by leveraging work done in the <a href="https://iris-project.org/pdfs/2019-popl-iron-final.pdf" rel="nofollow">Iron obligation management logic</a> built using Iris. We can use a concept of <strong>trackable effects</strong> to allow some safety conditions to be <em>optional</em>, so a project can successfully compile code without proving everything about it is safe, making fast iteration and incremental adoption possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Trackable effects will work by requiring a piece of some &#34;correctness token&#34; to be forever given up in order to perform a dangerous operation without justifying its safety with a proof. This would infect the violating code block with an effect type that will bubble up through any parent blocks. Defining effects in this way makes them completely composable <em>resources</em> rather than <em>wrappers</em>, meaning that they&#39;re more flexible and powerful than existing effect systems. Systems like algebraic effects or effect monads could be implemented using this resource paradigm, but the opposite isn&#39;t true.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the trackable effect system is defined in a sufficiently generic way then custom trackable effects could be created, allowing different projects to introduce new kinds of safety and correctness tracking, such as ensuring asynchronous code doesn&#39;t block the executor, or a web app doesn&#39;t render raw untrusted input, or a server doesn&#39;t leak secrets.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even if a project chooses to ignore some effects, they&#39;ll always know those effects are there, which means that other possible users of the project will know as well. Project teams could choose to fail compilation if their program isn&#39;t memory safe or could panic, while others could tolerate some possible effects or write proofs to assert they only happen in certain well-defined circumstances. It would even be possible to create code that provably sandboxes an effect by ensuring it can&#39;t be detected at any higher level if contained within the sandbox. With all these systems in place, we can finally have a genuinely secure software ecosystem!</p>

<p dir="auto">We can&#39;t write all software in assembly language! Including first-class support for powerful metaprogramming, alongside a <a href="https://ollef.github.io/blog/posts/query-based-compilers.html" rel="nofollow">query-based compiler</a>, will allow users of this language to build verified abstractions that &#34;combine upward&#34; into higher levels, while still allowing the possibility for those higher levels to &#34;drop down&#34; back into the lower levels. Being a proof assistant, these escape hatches don&#39;t have to be unsafe, as higher level code can provide proofs to the lower level to justify its actions.</p>
<p dir="auto">This ability to create fully verifiable higher level abstractions means we can create a &#34;verification pyramid&#34;, with excruciatingly verified software forming a foundation for a spectrum of software that decreases in importance and rigor. Not all software has the same constraints, and it would be dumb to to verify a recipe app as rigorously as a cryptography function. But even a recipe app would benefit from its foundations removing the need to worry about whole classes of safety and soundness conditions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Magmide <em>itself</em> doesn&#39;t have to achieve mainstream success to massively improve the quality of all downstream software, but merely some sub-language. Many engineers have never heard of LLVM, but they still implicitly rely on it every day. Magmide would seek to do the same. We don&#39;t have to make formal verification fully mainstream, we just have to make it available for the handful of people willing to do the work. If a full theorem prover is sitting right below the high-level language you&#39;re currently working in, you don&#39;t have to bother with it most of the time, but you still have the option to do so when it makes sense.</p>
<p dir="auto">The metaprogramming can of course also be used directly in the dependently typed language, allowing compile-time manipulation of proofs, functions, and data. Verified proof tactics, macros, and higher-level embedded programming languages are all possible. This is the layer where absolutely essential proof automation tactics similar to Coq&#39;s <code>auto</code> or <a href="http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/html/Cpdt.Intro.html" rel="nofollow">Adam Chlipala&#39;s <code>crush</code></a>, or fast counter-example searchers such as <code>quickcheck</code> would be implemented.</p>
<p dir="auto">Importantly, the language will be self-hosting, so metaprogramming functions will benefit from the same bare metal performance and full verifiability.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can find rough notes about the current design thinking for the metaprogramming interface in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/magmide/magmide/blob/main/posts/design-of-magmide.md"><code>posts/design-of-magmide.md</code></a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">My experience using languages like Coq has been extremely painful, and the interface is &#34;more knife than handle&#34;. I&#39;ve been astounded how willing academics seem to be to use extremely clunky workflows and syntaxes just to avoid having to build better tools.</p>
<p dir="auto">To achieve this goal, this project will learn heavily from <code>cargo</code> and other excellent projects. It should be possible to verify, interactively prove, query, compile, and run any Magmide code with a single tool.</p>
<p dir="auto">An important design choice that will likely make the tool easier to understand and use is the &#34;Logic/Host split&#34; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/magmide/magmide/blob/main/posts/design-of-magmide.md">(discussed deeply in <code>posts/design-of-magmide.md</code>)</a> that clearly separates &#34;imaginary&#34; pure functional code from the &#34;real&#34; imperative computational code.</p>

<p dir="auto">Working engineers are resource constrained and don&#39;t have years of free time to wade through arcane and disconnected academic papers. Academics aren&#39;t incentivized to properly explain and expose their amazing work, and a massive amount of <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/" rel="nofollow">research debt</a> has accrued in many fields, including formal verification.</p>
<p dir="auto">To achieve this goal, this project will enshrine the following values in regard to teaching materials:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Speak to a person who wants to get something done and not a review committee evaluating academic merit.</li>
<li>Put concrete examples front and center.</li>
<li>Point the audience toward truly necessary prerequisites rather than assuming shared knowledge.</li>
<li>Prefer graspable human words to represent ideas, never use opaque and unsearchable non-ascii symbols, and only use symbolic notations when it&#39;s both truly useful and properly explained.</li>
<li>Prioritize the hard work of finding clear and distilled explanations.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">How do we design something capable of meeting all the above design constraints? By choosing three pillar features that nicely interlock with each other and then &#34;maxing them out&#34; to the most powerful versions of themselves, we can build a tool capable of achieving our goal with the smallest amount of effort possible. These pillars hold up the entire design:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Maxed out in logical power</strong> by using the strongest type theory we can find. Without this the design wouldn&#39;t be able to handle lots of interesting/useful/necessary problems, and couldn&#39;t be adopted by many teams. It wouldn&#39;t be able to act as a true <em>foundation</em> for verified computing. It&#39;s important to note that this one design feature enables all the other features involving formal logic, such as the ability to formalize bare metal computation at a high level of abstractness and the use of trackable effects.</li>
<li><strong>Maxed out in computational power</strong> by self-hosting in a bare metal language. If the language were interpreted or garbage collected then it would always perform worse than is strictly possible. It would be silly for metaprogramming to be done in a different language than the intended target languages. If we&#39;re going to formalize bare metal computation, we might as well use it to build the tool itself!</li>
<li><strong>Maxed out in expressive power</strong> by making it deeply metaprogrammable from the beginning. Metaprogramming is basically a cheat code for language design, since it gives a language access to an infinite range of possible features without having to explicitly support them. It&#39;s the single best primitive to add in terms of implementation overhead versus expressiveness. Making the compiler query-based maxes out metaprogrammatic capability, since every bit of work done in the core compiler can be exposed for reuse.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I claim that none of these major features could be removed or weakened and still allow the project to achieve its goals. If these features weren&#39;t the strongest versions of themselves we would be leaving power on the table that we wouldn&#39;t have to, and we&#39;d just be wasting time before some other better design shows up in a few years. All these design features are tractable, so we shouldn&#39;t stop short.</p>
<p dir="auto">Building such a language is a massively ambitious goal. It might even be too ambitious! But we have to also consider the opposite: perhaps previous projects haven&#39;t been ambitious enough, and that&#39;s why formal verification is still niche! Software has been broken for too long, and we won&#39;t have truly solved the problem until it&#39;s possible and tractable for <em>all</em> software to be verified.</p>

<p dir="auto">Yes! None of the technical details of this idea are untested or novel. Dependently typed proof languages, higher-order separation logic, query-based compilers, introspective metaprogramming, and abstract assembly languages are all ideas that have been proven in other contexts. Magmide would merely attempt to combine them into one unified and practical package.</p>

<p dir="auto">Mostly because this idea exists in an &#34;incentive no man&#39;s land&#34;.</p>
<p dir="auto">Academics aren&#39;t incentivized to create something like this, because doing so is just &#34;applied&#34; research which tends not to be as prestigious. You don&#39;t get to write many groundbreaking papers by taking a bunch of existing ideas and putting them together nicely.</p>
<p dir="auto">Software engineers aren&#39;t incentivized to create something like this, because a programming language is a pure public good and there aren&#39;t any truly viable business models that can support it while still remaining open. Even amazing public good ideas like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System" rel="nofollow">interplanetary filesystem</a> could be productized by applying the protocol to markets of networked computers, but a programming language can&#39;t really pull off that kind of maneuver.</p>
<p dir="auto">Although the software startup ecosystem does routinely build pure public goods such as databases and web frameworks, those projects tend to have an obvious and relatively short path to being useful in revenue-generating SaaS companies. The problems they solve are clear and visible enough that well-funded engineers can both recognize them and justify the time to fix them. In contrast the path to usefulness for a project like Magmide is absolutely not short, and despite promising immense benefits to both our industry and society as a whole, most engineers capable of building it can&#39;t clearly see those benefits behind the impenetrable fog of research debt.</p>

<p dir="auto">We only got Rust because Mozilla has been investing in dedicated research for a long time, and it still doesn&#39;t seem to have really paid off for them in the way you might hope.</p>

<p dir="auto">Maybe! We can&#39;t force people or guarantee it will be successful, but we can learn a lot from how Rust has been able to successfully teach quite complex ideas to an huge and excited audience. I think Rust has succeeded by:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>Making big promises</em> in terms of how performant/robust/safe the final code can be.</li>
<li><em>Delivering on those promises</em> by building something awesome. I hope that since the entire project will have verification in mind from the start it will be easier to ship something excellent and robust with less churn than usual.</li>
<li><em>Respecting people&#39;s time</em> by making the teaching materials clear and distilled and the tooling simple and ergonomic.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">All of those things are easier said than done! Fully achieving those goals will require work from a huge community of contributors.</p>

Do you actually think this is worth it?</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Emphatically yes it is worth it.</strong> As alluded to earlier, broken software is a massive drain on our society. Even if it were much more expensive to write verified software, it would still be worth it. Rust has already taught us that it&#39;s almost always worth it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylOpCXI2EMM&amp;t=565s&amp;ab_channel=Rust" rel="nofollow">have the hangover first</a> rather than wastefully churn on a problem after you thought you could move on.</p>
<p dir="auto">Verification is obviously very difficult. Although I have some modest theories about ways to speed up/improve automatic theorem proving, and how to teach verification concepts in a more intuitive way that can thereby involve a larger body of engineers, we still can&#39;t avoid the fact that refining our abstractions and proving theorems is hard and will remain so.</p>
<p dir="auto">But we don&#39;t have to make verification completely easy and approachable to still get massive improvements. We only have to make proof labor more <em>available</em> and <em>reusable</em>. Since Magmide will be inherently metaprogrammable and integrate programming and proving, developments in one project can quickly disseminate through the entire language community. Research would be much less likely to remain trapped in the ivory tower, and could be usefully deployed in real software much more quickly.</p>
<p dir="auto">And of course, a big goal of the project is to make verification less expensive! Tooling, better education, better algorithms and abstractions can all decrease verification burden. If the project ever reaches maturity these kinds of improvements will likely be most of the continued effort for a long time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Besides, many projects already write <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/156883/what-is-a-normal-functional-lines-of-code-to-test-lines-of-code-ratio" rel="nofollow">absolutely gobs of unit tests</a>, and a proof is literally <em>infinitely</em> better than a unit test. At this point I&#39;m actually hopeful that proofs will <em>decrease</em> the cost of writing software. We&#39;ll see.</p>

<p dir="auto">No! Although it&#39;s certainly <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/formal-verification-creates-hacker-proof-code-20160920/" rel="nofollow">very exciting to see how truly secure verified software can be</a>, there will always be a long tail of hacking risk. Not all code will be written in securable languages, not all engineers will have the diligence or the oversight to write secure code, people can make bad assumptions, and brilliant hackers might invent entirely new <em>types</em> of attack vectors that aren&#39;t considered by our safety specifications (although inventing new attack vectors is obviously way more difficult than just doing some web searches and running scripts, which is all a hacker has to do today).</p>
<p dir="auto">However <em>any</em> verified software is better than <em>none</em>, and right now it&#39;s basically impossible for a security-conscious team to even attempt to prove their code secure. Hopefully the &#34;verification pyramid&#34; referred to earlier will enable almost all software to quickly reuse secure foundations provided by someone else.</p>
<p dir="auto">And of course, social engineering and hardware tampering are never going away, no matter how perfect our software is.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is nuanced, but the answer is still yes!</p>
<p dir="auto">First let&#39;s get something out of the way: software is <em>literally nothing more</em> than a mathematical/logical machine. It is one of the very few things in the world that can actually be perfect. Of course this perfection is in regard to an axiomatic model of a real machine rather than the true machine itself. But isn&#39;t it better to have an implementation that&#39;s provably correct according to a model rather than what we have now, an implementation that&#39;s obviously flawed according to that same model? Formal verification is really just the next level of type checking, and type checking is still incredibly useful despite also only relating to a model.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you don&#39;t think a logical model can be accurate enough to model a real machine in sufficient detail, please check out these papers discussing <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.ohearn/papers/Marktoberdorf11LectureNotes.pdf" rel="nofollow">separation logic</a>, extremely high fidelity formalizations of the <a href="http://nickbenton.name/hlsl.pdf" rel="nofollow">x86</a> and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mom22/arm-hoare-logic.pdf" rel="nofollow">arm</a> instruction sets, and <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/papers/iris-ground-up/paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">Iris</a>. Academics have been busy doing amazing stuff, even if they haven&#39;t been sharing it very well.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you think we&#39;ll constantly be tripping over problems in incorrectly implemented operating systems or web browsers, well you&#39;re missing the whole point of this project. These systems provide environments for other software yes, but they&#39;re still just software themselves. Even if they aren&#39;t perfectly reliable <em>now</em>, the entire ambition of this project is to <em>make</em> them reliable.</p>
<p dir="auto">We would however need hardware axioms to model the abstractions provided by a concrete computer architecture, and this layer is trickier to be completely confident in. Hardware faults and ambient problems of all kinds can absolutely cause unavoidable data corruption. Hardware is intentionally designed with layers of error correction and redundancy to avoid propagating corruption, but it still gets through sometimes. There&#39;s one big reason to press on with formal verification nonetheless: the possibility of corruption or failure can be included in our axioms!</p>
<p dir="auto">Firmware and operating systems already include state consistency assertions and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction" rel="nofollow">error correction codes</a>, and it would be nice if those checks themselves could be verified. The entire purpose of trackable effects is to allow environmental assumptions to be as high fidelity and stringent as possible without requiring every piece of software to actually care about all that detail. This means the lowest levels of our verification pyramid can fully include the possibility of corruption and carefully prove it can only cause a certain amount of damage in a few well-understood places. Then the higher levels of the pyramid can build on top of that much sturdier foundation. Additionally the concept of <a href="https://github.com/magmide/magmide/blob/main/posts/design-of-magmide.md#corruption-panics">corruption panics</a> would allow software to include consistency checks even in situations that are logically impossible, to account for situations where the hardware has failed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Yes it&#39;s true that we can only go so far with formal verification, so we should always remain humble and remember that real machines in the real world fail for lots of reasons we can&#39;t control. But we can go much much farther with formal verification than we can with testing alone! Proving correctness against a mere model with possible caveats is incalculably more robust than doing the same thing we&#39;ve been doing for decades.</p>

<p dir="auto">The biggest reason is that Coq is the language <a href="https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/iris/" rel="nofollow">Iris</a> is implemented in, and since that project will be a core component of Magmide it makes the most sense to be as compatible as possible. Iris will likely need to be ported to Magmide once it&#39;s bootstrapped, so it would be nice to avoid also porting it to the bootstrapping language.</p>

<p dir="auto">The short answer is that languages like Coq weren&#39;t designed with the intent of making formal verification mainstream, so they&#39;re all pretty mismatched to the task.

Especially interesting has been what it looks like to prove some specific assembly language program will always terminate, and to ergonomically discover paths in the control flow graph which require extra proof justification. I have some raw notes and thoughts about this in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/magmide/magmide/blob/main/posts/toward-termination-vcgen.md"><code>posts/toward-termination-vcgen.md</code></a>. Basically I&#39;ve been playing with the design for the foundational computational theory.</p>
<p dir="auto">In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/magmide/magmide/blob/main/posts/design-of-magmide.md"><code>posts/design-of-magmide.md</code></a> I outline my guess at the project&#39;s major milestones. Obviously a project as gigantic as this can only be achieved by inspiring a lot of hardworking people to come and make contributions, so each milestone will have to show exciting enough capability to make the next milestone happen.</p>

<li><code>notes.md</code> is a scratchpad for raw ideas, usually ripped right from my brain with very little editing.</li>
<li><code>README.future.md</code> is speculative writing about a &#34;by example&#34; introduction to the language.

<p dir="auto">A proof checker with builtin support for metaprogramming and verification of assembly languages would allow us to build any logically representable software system imaginable. Here are some rough ideas I think are uniquely empowered by the blend of capabilities that would be afforded by Magmide. Not all of these ideas are <em>only</em> possible with full verification, but I feel they would get much more tractable.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a general quality, one that could apply to any piece of software. With machine checked proofs, it&#39;s possible to write software <em>that never has to be rewritten or maintained</em>. Of course in practice we often want to add features or improve the interface or performance of a piece of software, and those kind of expected improvements can&#39;t be anticipated enough to prove them ahead of time.</p>
<p dir="auto">But if the intended function of a piece of software is completely understood and won&#39;t significantly evolve, it&#39;s possible to get it right <em>once and for all</em>. Places where this would be a good idea are places where it&#39;s hard to get to the software, such as in many embedded systems like firmware, IOT applications, software in spacecraft, etc.</p>

<p dir="auto">If it&#39;s possible to prove a piece of code is well-behaved in arbitrary ways then it&#39;s possible to simply run foreign and untrusted code without any kind of sandboxing or resource limitations, as long as that foreign code provides a consistent proof object demonstrating it won&#39;t cause trouble.</p>
<p dir="auto">What kind of performance improvements and increased flexibility could we gain if layers like operating systems, hypervisors, or even internet browsers only had to type check foreign code to know it was safe to execute with arbitrary system access? Of course we still might deem this too large a risk, but it&#39;s interesting to imagine.</p>

<p dir="auto">It isn&#39;t good enough for voting machines to be provably secure, the voting system itself must be cryptographically transparent and auditable. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_auditable_voting_systems" rel="nofollow">ideal requirements</a> are extremely complex, and would be very difficult to get right without machine checked proofs.</p>
<p dir="auto">Voting is sufficiently high stakes that it&#39;s extremely important for a voting infrastructure to not simply be correct, but be <em>undeniably</em> correct. I imagine it will be much easier to assert the fairness and legitimacy of voting results if all the underlying code is much more than merely audited and tested.</p>

<p dir="auto">All computer programs in our world operate on bits, and those bits are commonly interpreted as the same few types of values (numbers, strings, booleans, lists, structures of those things, standardized media types).

<p dir="auto">It would be very exciting to know with deep rigorous certainty that a program can be compiled for a broad host of architectures and model the same logical behavior on all of them.</p>

<p dir="auto">In many languages some idea of encapsulation or data hiding is supported by the language, to allow component authors to ensure outside components don&#39;t reach into data structures and break invariants. With proof checking available, it&#39;s possible to simply encode invariants directly alongside data, effectively making arbitrary invariants a part of the type system. When this is true data no longer has to be hidden at the type system level. We can still choose to make some data hidden from documentation, but doing so would simply be for clarity rather than necessity.</p>
<p dir="auto">Removing the need for data hiding allows us to reconsider almost all common software architectures, since most are simply trying to enforce consistency with extra separation. Correct composition can be easy and flexible, so we can architect systems for greatest performance or clarity and remove unnecessary walls. For example strict microservice architectures might lose much of their usefulness.</p>

<p dir="auto">The process model is a very good abstraction, but the main reason it&#39;s useful is because it creates hard boundaries around different programs to prevent them from corrupting each other&#39;s state. Related to the above point, what if we don&#39;t have to do that anymore? What if code from different sources could simply inhabit the same memory space without much intervention?</p>
<p dir="auto">The Rust community has made some very innovative strides with their asynchronous executor implementations, and I am one person who believes the &#34;async task&#34; paradigm is an extremely natural way to think about system concurrency and separation. What if an async task executor could simply be the entire operating system, doing nothing but managing task scheduling and type checking new code to ensure it will be well-behaved? In this paradigm, the abstractions offered by the operating system can be moved into a <em>library</em> instead of being offered at runtime, and can use arbitrary capability types to enforce permissions or other requirements. Might such a system be both much more performant and simpler to reason about?</p>

<p dir="auto">Most databases are designed to run as an isolated service to ensure the persistence layer is always in a consistent state that can&#39;t accidentally be violated by user code. With proof invariants this isn&#39;t necessary, and databases can be implemented as mere libraries.</p>
<p dir="auto">Immutable update logs have proven their value, and with proof checking it would be much easier to correctly build &#34;mutable seeming&#34; materialized views based on update commands.

<p dir="auto">However the model is too simple for many obviously correct scenarios, such as mutation of a value from multiple places within the same thread, or pointers in complex data structures that still only point to ownership ancestors or strict siblings such as is the case in doubly-linked lists. More advanced invariants and arbitrary proofs can solve this problem.</p>

<p dir="auto">Reactive programming models have become ubiquitous in most user interface ecosystems, but in order to make sense they often rely on the tacit assumption that user code doesn&#39;t introduce resource leaks or deadlocks or infinite cycles between reactive tasks. Verification can step in here, and produce algorithms that enforce tree-like structures for arbitrary code.</p>
