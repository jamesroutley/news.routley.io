Edit: full story by request, long read:
----</p><p>Previous month billing didn&#39;t went through. Not sure if this was due to the billing outage google had (https://status.cloud.google.com/products/oLCqDYkE9NFWQVgctQTL/history) or financial transaction issue, however we went ahead and made a manual payment covering all the outstanding amount + extra. Despite the payment made, about a week+ later we suddenly started receiving threatening emails &#34;Your Projects are at risk of suspension&#34;. Edited and updated the billing cards. Opened a billing support request clearly mentioning this is a production environment and all the bills are paid. They were &#34;investigating&#34; the issue and assured the project will not be suspended.</p></td></tr>
