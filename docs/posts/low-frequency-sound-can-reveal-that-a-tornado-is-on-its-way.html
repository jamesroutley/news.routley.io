Eventually the rotating air becomes focused into a narrow column that when it reaches the ground becomes a tornado. But while there are many theories about what causes this to happen – such as <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/vortex2/">temperature differences in the air on the outside of the storm<!-- --></a> – the exact conditions that cause a tornado to form <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/">are not fully understood<!-- --></a>.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>The wind itself is also invisible to the human eye.

This can also mean the tornado warnings that rely upon this method can often turn out to be false alarms as the supercell thunderstorm detected using the radar don&#39;t ever produce a tornado, says Nowotarski. Often, storm spotters on the ground are needed to verify whether a tornado has formed.<!-- --></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Many storms that appear &#39;primed&#39; to produce a tornado never do so,&#34; says Nowotarski. &#34;False alarms are problematic, because a tornado warning can be disruptive to special events, work, and everyday life.  While not as disruptive as a tornado, too many &#39;boy who cried wolf&#39; events will encourage the public to not take action in future warnings and be unprepared when a tornado actually does it.&#34;<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Forecasters also tend to err on the side of caution when issuing warnings – understandable, as the consequences of not sheltering can be deadly.
