After marking bcachefs &#34;externally maintained&#34; in 6.17, Linus Torvalds has
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f2c61db29f27">removed
it entirely</a> for 6.18.  &#34;<q>It&#39;s now a DKMS module, making the in-kernel
code stale, so remove it to avoid any version confusion.</q>&#34;</p></div> <!-- ArticleText -->

Just curious, no judgement: How is this decision made? Can Linus just decide that he removes something from the kernel?<br/>

      Yes, Linus can make that kind of decision.  He doesn&#39;t just do it on his own, though; there was a long series of public and private discussions that led up to this one.
