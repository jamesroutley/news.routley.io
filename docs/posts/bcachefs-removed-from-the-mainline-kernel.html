After marking bcachefs &#34;externally maintained&#34; in 6.17, Linus Torvalds has
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f2c61db29f27">removed
it entirely</a> for 6.18.  &#34;<q>It&#39;s now a DKMS module, making the in-kernel
code stale, so remove it to avoid any version confusion.</q>&#34;</p></div> <!-- ArticleText -->

Before Bcachefs getting mainlined, one had to get the whole kernel source tree from the Bcachefs author. This happened because this filesystem relied on changes in other subsystems, and was not just a self-contained add-on. Upon upstreaming, the required changes were applied to these subsystems, making Bcachefs self-contained, and then it was split out as a module that can be compiled via DKMS.</p></div>
