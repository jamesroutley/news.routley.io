<p>Artificial intelligence, like machine learning before it, is making big money off what I call the “sell ∀ ∃ as ∃ ∀ scam.”</p>
<p>The scam works as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a system that solves problems, but with an important user-facing control. For AI systems like GPT-X this is “<a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/prompt-engineering-vs-blind-prompting">prompt engineering</a>.” For machine learning it is commonly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning)">hyper-parameters</a>.</li>
<li>Convince the user that it is <em>their</em> job to find a instantiation or setting of this control to make the system work for their tasks. Soften this by implying there is a setting of the control that works for all of their problems, so finding that setting is worth the trouble.  This is the “∃ ∀” claim: that there <em>exists (∃)</em> a setting or configuration that makes the system work for <em>all (∀)</em> of your examples.</li>
<li>In practice just make the setting or control complicated enough to provide memorization or over-fitting. That is: exploit the fact that for sufficiently rich systems is is relatively easy to provide a “∀ ∃” system. That is a system for <em>every (∀)</em> task, there <em>exists (∃)</em> a setting that gives the correct answer for that one task. It is just there is no one setting useful for all tasks. This can devolve into something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptomorphism">cryptomorphic</a> to “the system can copy the answer from its input to its output.”</li>
</ul>
<center></center>
<p>In my opinion one can see this scam of hiding some debt in with an asset spreading.</p>
<p>Earliest modeling systems, such as linear regression, had no hyper-parameters. An under specified algorithm was not considered a fully specified method.</p>
<p>Machine learning systems, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">random forest</a>, have hyper-parameters. However, they specified how to set them in the paper and supplied an implementation that set the hyper-parameters. Hyper-parameters were seen as embarrassing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a> to be solved before releasing the system into the wild.</p>
<p>Then we get to boosting, neural nets, large language models, and others. These are <em>very</em> useful methods. Also, as they the hyper-parameter selection fully to the users, they become not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiable</a>. If <em>they</em> didn’t work, it is because <em>you</em> didn’t pick the right hyper-parameters or training procedures. These are among my favorite methods, but they do have a bit of a fortress-like “no true Scotsman” defense built in. And, if you are only rewarding first to appear correct- you will (by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias">selection bias</a>) end up only rewarding scams.</p>
<p>To conclude: one <em>must</em> have <em>different</em> standards for developing systems than for testing, deploying, or using systems. Or: testing on your training data is a common way to cheat, but so is training on your test data.</p>
