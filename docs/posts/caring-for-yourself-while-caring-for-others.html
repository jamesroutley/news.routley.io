            <p>Are you helping a loved one with daily tasks, medical care, or emotional support? If so, you’re a <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/caregivers.html" target="_blank">caregiver</a>…and you’re not alone. According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr144-508.pdf" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, nearly 1 in 5 adults in the United States are now caregivers, and the number is growing as the population ages.</p>

<p>Caregiving can be an extremely rewarding experience, but it can also be physically and emotionally draining. Whether you’re supporting an aging parent, a spouse with a chronic illness, or a friend recovering from surgery, it’s easy to be so focused on their needs that <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/caregiverhealth.html" target="_blank">you forget about your own</a>.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing: if you’re exhausted, easily agitated, feeling disconnected from others, or unable to take care of your own needs—if you don’t <a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2017/12/coping-caregiving" target="_blank">“fill your own cup”</a>—you can’t give your loved one your best care.</p>

<h2>Your health matters</h2>

<p>Caregivers often put their own health on the back burner. Research shows that caregivers are at a <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/caregiver-stress" target="_blank">greater risk for chronic health conditions</a> such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and depression. That’s why it’s so important to pay attention to your own health needs.</p>

<p>It’s not always easy to recognize when you’re pushing yourself too hard, so keep an eye out for these signs:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Do you feel constantly tired or overwhelmed?</li>
	<li>Are you getting irritated easily?</li>
	<li>Are you having trouble sleeping?</li>
	<li>Have you lost interest in activities you used to enjoy?</li>
	<li>Are you experiencing frequent headaches or other physical problems?</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of this sounds familiar, it might be time to focus on self-care.</p>

<h2>Preventing and managing caregiver stress</h2>

<p>Many caregivers struggle with guilt around taking time for themselves. But remember, taking care of yourself isn’t selfish; it’s necessary for your health and well-being, which directly benefits the person you’re caring for.</p>

<p>Here are some tips from the <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/caregiving/taking-care-yourself-tips-caregivers" target="_blank">National Institute on Aging</a> and the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/patient-education/caring-for-the-caregiver" target="_blank">National Cancer Institute</a> to help you take care of your own physical and mental health while being there for someone else:</p>

<h3>1. Let others lend a hand</h3>

<p>As a caregiver, you might feel like you have to do it all. But you’re not in this alone. Reach out to friends and family for help, and don&#39;t be afraid to say yes when someone offers support.</p>

<p>Be specific about what you need. Maybe a friend could pick up groceries or a family member could sit with your loved one for an hour while you take a break. Many people want to help—they just might not know how.</p>

<h3>2. Take time to recharge</h3>

<p>Try to do something for yourself every day. You could read a chapter of a book you enjoy, practice deep breathing or meditation, or meet up with a friend. Even if it’s just a short walk or a few minutes of quiet time, stepping away from caregiving responsibilities can help recharge your batteries.</p>

<h3>3. Prioritize your own health</h3>

<p>One of the most important parts of self-care is taking care of your own health. This includes being active, eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and getting enough sleep.</p>

<p>It’s also important to keep up with your own medical appointments and screenings. Make sure your doctor knows about your caregiving role and tell them how you’ve been feeling (both physically and mentally).</p>

<h3>4. Be gentle with yourself</h3>

<p>It’s common to experience a wide range of emotions as a caregiver. You might feel frustrated, sad, resentful, joyful—all in the same day or even in the same hour! These feelings are a normal part of the caregiving experience, and it’s okay to express them.</p>

<h3>5. Recognize when it’s time for a break</h3>

<p>If you’re feeling overwhelmed, consider speaking with a counselor or your doctor. They can offer resources and support to help you manage these feelings.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/caregiving/what-respite-care" target="_blank" title="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/caregiving/what-respite-care">Respite care</a>, which offers short-term relief for primary caregivers, may also be an option. Services can range from a few hours of in-home help to a short stay with your loved one at their care facility. Respite care gives caregivers time to rest, travel, or spend time with other family and friends.</p>

<h3>6. Connect with other caregivers</h3>

<p>Caregiver support groups can be a great way to talk about your experience with people who understand what you’re going through. Your health care provider or local senior center may be able to recommend a group in your area.</p>

<p>Self-care might seem overwhelming right now, and that’s okay. You don’t have to tackle everything at once. Even small steps can make an enormous difference in your well-being…and your ability to care for others.</p>
