    <h1>Wikipedia loses challenge against Online Safety Act</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><p>Wikipedia has lost a legal challenge to new Online Safety Act rules which it says could threaten the human rights and safety of its volunteer editors.</p><p>The Wikimedia Foundation - the non-profit which supports the online encyclopaedia - wanted a judicial review of regulations which could mean Wikipedia has to verify the identities of its users.</p><p>But it said despite the loss, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Wikimedia-Foundation-and-another-v-Secretary-of-State-for-Science-Innovation-and-Technology.pdf">the judgement</a> &#34;emphasized the responsibility of Ofcom and the UK government to ensure Wikipedia is protected&#34;.</p><p>The government told the BBC it welcomed the High Court&#39;s judgment, &#34;which will help us continue our work implementing the Online Safety Act to create a safer online world for everyone&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Judicial reviews challenge the lawfulness of the way in which a decision has been made by a public body.</p><p>In this case the Wikimedia Foundation and a Wikipedia editor tried to challenge the way in which the government decided to make regulations covering which sites should be classed &#34;Category 1&#34; under the Online Safety Act - the strictest rules sites must follow.</p><p>It argued the rules were logically flawed and too broad, meaning a policy intended to impose extra rules on large social media companies would instead apply to Wikipedia.</p><p>In particular the foundation is concerned the extra duties required - if Wikipedia was classed as Category 1 - would mean it would have to verify the identity of its contributors, undermining their privacy and safety.</p><p>The only way it could avoid being classed as Category 1 would be to cut the number of people in the UK who could access the online encyclopaedia by about three-quarters, or disable key functions on the site. </p><p>The government&#39;s lawyers argued that ministers had  considered whether Wikipedia should be exempt from the regulations but had reasonably rejected the idea.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In the end, the court rejected Wikimedia&#39;s arguments.</p><p>But Phil Bradley-Schmieg, Lead Counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation, said the judgment did not give Ofcom and the Secretary of State, in Mr Justice Johnson&#39;s words, &#34;a green light to implement a regime that would significantly impede Wikipedia&#39;s operations&#34;.</p><p>And the judgement makes it clear other legal challenges could be possible. </p><p>Wikimedia could potentially challenge Ofcom&#39;s decision making if the regulator did ultimately decide to classify the site as Category 1.</p><p>And if the effect of making Wikipedia Category 1 meant it could not continue to operate, then other legal challenges could follow.</p><p>&#34;Wikipedia has been caught in the stricter regulations due to its size and user created content even though it argues (convincingly) that it differs significantly from other user-to-user platforms,&#34; said Mona Schroedel, data protection litigation specialist at law firm Freeths.</p><p>&#34;The court&#39;s decision has left the door open for Wikipedia to be exempt from the stricter rules upon review.&#34;</p><p>The communications regulator Ofcom, which will enforce the act, told the BBC: &#34;We note the court&#39;s judgment and will continue to progress our work in relation to categorised services and the associated extra online safety rules for those companies.&#34;</p></div></div>
