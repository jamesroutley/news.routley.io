Over the last four years, those teams shipped <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/comma-three-press-release">two</a> <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/comma3X">products</a>, a <a href="https://commabody.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">robotics platform</a>, 3 major and 30 minor openpilot <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/RELEASES.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">releases</a>, the first end-to-end <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/end-to-end-lateral-planning/">driving</a> <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/090release/#experimental-mode">agent</a>, and a drive to <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/taco-bell">Taco Bell</a> without a disengagement.</p>
<p>As the company has grown, it’s time to refactor things a bit. Remember that our mission is to:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solve self-driving cars while delivering shippable intermediaries.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>comma is fundamentally a consumer electronics company that ships the latest AI to you as a product. Consumer electronics is a good business to be in; we’re building products that we’d like to buy, and it allows us to <a href="https://github.com/commaai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build in the open</a>.</p>

This includes money, people, logistics, the comma fleet, and keeping everything running.</p>
<p>The <strong>product team</strong> designs and manufactures the product. This includes the hardware, low level <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">software</a> needed to run the autonomous agent software, as well the <a href="https://comma.ai/connect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">app</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/autonomy"><strong>autonomy team</strong></a> is responsible for making the <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/selfdrive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autonomous agent software</a>, and all of the infrastructure needed for that.</p>
<p>The operations and product teams work together to ship you the comma 3X, and the autonomy and product teams ship openpilot to run on your comma 3X.</p>
<h2 id="lets-take-a-look-at-where-were-at-now">Let’s take a look at where we’re at now</h2>
<p>comma is a 21 person company made up of mostly engineers, and we build and ship all our hardware and software from our San Diego, CA <a href="https://youtu.be/PFjssb7r_uU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office</a>.</p>
<p>We’re shipping <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/097release">openpilot 0.9.7</a>, with 54% of miles and 29% of time engaged.</p>

We’re scaling up the factory to output 10x more devices.</p>

<p>It should be clear now that widespread deployment of driverless cars is still years away. Meanwhile, openpilot’s partial autonomy improves driving on 10 million compatible cars currently on the road, with more sold every day.</p>
<p>With user growth on a product that’s profitable and machine learning simulation <a href="https://youtu.be/dfIZGEXvXis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working</a>, the path forward is clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drive down disengagements with our new simulator</li>
<li>Improve the product until it looks like something you can buy at Best Buy and drive out of the parking lot with</li>
<li>Scale up production until we have a lights-out factory</li>
</ol>

<p>We’re growing the team by ~5 people to help solve autonomy, improve the product, and scale up production. You’ll hear more about each team in the following posts from the head of each team.</p>
<p>Check out our new <a href="https://comma.ai/leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaderboard</a> and <a href="https://comma.ai/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jobs page</a>. It’s got some fun programming challenges that also happen to be hiring challenges.</p>
<h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>
<p><em>&gt; If the software is open source, how will comma make money?</em></p>
<p>We sell a <a href="https://comma.ai/shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardware product</a> and offer a (very optional) <a href="https://comma.ai/connect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">software subscription</a>.</p>
<p>And we’re already making money. We last raised money <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/comma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two years ago</a>, and since then, have been profitable from sales in our <a href="https://comma.ai/shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shop</a>.</p>
<p><em>&gt; Why open source the software at all?</em></p>
<p>We like working on open source projects, and it leaves no room for <a href="https://x.com/comma_ai/status/1793018640968863829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rent seeking</a>.</p>
<p><em>&gt; If the software is open source, won’t there be clones?</em></p>
<p>Like <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/forks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forks</a> of openpilot, clones grow the ecosystem. The openpilot software and hardware ecosystem has grown well beyond us, and we’ll continue to do fine as long as we offer a good product for a fair price.</p>
<p><em>&gt; What happens when cars ship with openpilot-quality ADAS?</em></p>
<p>Have the auto manufacturers even shipped you a CarPlay-level infotainment system? How about OTA updates?</p>
<p><em>&gt; Why not partner with the car companies?</em></p>
<p>The quality of the product is currently the bottleneck for getting openpilot in more cars. And it’s not clear that <a href="https://x.com/alvinfoo/status/1812713741785440381" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they</a> can give us better interfaces to the car than <a href="https://github.com/commaai/opendbc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opendbc</a>.</p>
<p>Cars will eventually <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/working-with-comma-a-guide-for-car-companies/">ship with openpilot</a>, but it remains to be seen how this plays out. Maybe a Tier 1 will do it for the existing manufacturers, or perhaps some <a href="https://aptera.us/openpilot-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new manufacturer</a> will be the first.</p></section>
