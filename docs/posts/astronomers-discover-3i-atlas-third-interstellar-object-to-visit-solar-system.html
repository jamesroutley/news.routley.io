    <h1>Astronomers discover 3I/ATLAS – Third interstellar object to visit Solar System</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For only the third time in history, astronomers have discovered a new interstellar object that originated from outside our Solar System.</p><p>The object, known as 3I/ATLAS, is likely a comet and is much faster than any other interstellar object found before. </p><p>The object appears to be hurtling towards our Sun at about 60 kilometres a second. </p><p>&#34;This thing is coming in at such an incredible speed that absolutely nothing in the Solar System could have caused this,&#34; Jonti Horner, an astronomer at the University of Southern Queensland, said. </p><div data-component="EmphasisedText"><blockquote>&#34;<!-- -->Of the three interstellar objects we have seen, this is by far the fastest.<!-- -->&#34;</blockquote></div><p>There are only two other interstellar objects that have previously been<strong> </strong>tracked entering our Solar System — <a href="https://ntietz.com/news/2023-03-23/scientists-offer-non-alien-explanation-for-oumuamua/102138318" data-component="Link">&#39;Oumuamua</a> and <a href="https://ntietz.com/news/science/2019-11-16/interstellar-comet-2i-borisov-excites-astronomers/11691940" data-component="Link">Comet 2I/Borisov.</a></p><p>&#34;It&#39;s so exciting,&#34; Professor Horner added.</p><p>Rumblings of the potential interstellar object started in astronomy groups when the object was first detected early this week.</p><p>&#34;It has been picked up so early — relatively speaking — that we&#39;ve got at least eight months [during which]<strong> </strong>we&#39;ll be able to observe it,&#34; he said.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">How was 3I/ATLAS found?</h2><p>The object was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile on 1 July.</p><p>Follow-up observations confirmed the orbit was extremely unusual — almost unaffected by the Sun&#39;s gravity, Professor Horner said. </p><div data-component="EmphasisedText"><blockquote>&#34;<!-- -->Plotting the orbit of this thing [shows] it barely bends as it goes past the Sun.<!-- -->&#34;</blockquote></div><figure data-print="inline-media" data-component="Figure" id="105489798" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/105489798"><div><div><div><p><img alt="A diagram showing the comet&#39;s pathway in relation to the orbital planes of other planets." sizes="100vw" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c8df4323378d4510e159be29b39480c2?src" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"/></p></div></div></div><figcaption><p data-component="Typography">The trajectory of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the Solar System.<!-- --> <cite>(<span>Supplied: CSS, D.

Rubin Observatory released just last week</a>, it&#39;s likely that this is just a taste of what is to come. </p><p>Interstellar objects have been extremely rare so far, but with better telescopes like the Rubin Observatory, we&#39;re likely to catch many more of these objects when they arrive. </p><p>&#34;We&#39;ve had three [interstellar objects] in less than a decade with our current technology,&#34; Professor Horner said. </p><p>&#34;The Rubin Observatory is probably an order of magnitude better at finding things … so that would suggest we&#39;ll find a few of these per year.&#34;</p><p>Within its first 10 hours of operation the observatory detected more than 2,000 previously unknown asteroids in the Solar System. </p><div data-component="EmphasisedText"><blockquote>&#34;<!-- -->It&#39;s kind of a sneak peek into the future.<!-- -->&#34;</blockquote></div></div></div>
