    <h1>The German automotive industry wants to develop open-source software together</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h4><span>Collaboration for more speed, efficiency, and security in software development and the basis for an open and collaborative ecosystem</span></h4></p><div data-speakable="text"><p>With the support of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), 11 companies in the automotive industry have agreed on pre-competitive cooperation in open source software development.</p>

<p>A corresponding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed today at the 29th International Automotive Electronics Congress (AEK).</p>

<p>With the increasing importance and complexity of vehicle software, it is becoming critical for the industry to increase speed and efficiency in development while ensuring high quality and safety.</p>

<p>EA significant portion of the vehicle software is not directly accessible to the user and therefore not differentiating. This fact allows the corresponding software modules to be developed jointly in an open and collaborative ecosystem.</p>

<p>In order to achieve the necessary functional safety for automotive series software, a groundbreaking development process for open source was developed in preparation for certification according to the relevant standards.</p>

<p>In addition, by providing executable software modules instead of detailed specifications, standardization and increased development speed are achieved through the so-called code-first approach.</p>

<p>This ecosystem is open, both through software interoperability with relevant industry standards and for contributions and collaboration from other European and international companies.</p>

<p>The initiative&#39;s timeline envisages that the software scope for series development of a platform for autonomous driving will be available in 2026.</p>

<p>The modular software scope can be adapted or expanded and then made available to the industry as a customized distribution for series development. This allows manufacturers and suppliers to focus on differentiating features while maintaining core components together. This creates a strong foundation for innovation - and the freedom to focus on what makes the difference for the customer.</p>

<p>&#34;Together we are building a future-proof and powerful software ecosystem - open, transparent and secure,&#34; VDA Managing Director Dr. Marcus Bollig said.</p>
