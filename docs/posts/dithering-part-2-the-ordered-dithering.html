<p>tap/click the right side of the screen to go forward →</p><p>Hi! Welcome back to part 2 of my dithering series!</p><p>← tap/click the left side to go back</p><p>If you missed part 1, please check it out first! I&#39;ve covered how dithering simulates more colors than actually exist.</p><p>← or use arrow keys to navigate →</p><p>This part dives into ordered dithering, a method using a threshold map to decide each pixel&#39;s final color*.</p><p>*Note: This series covers grayscale dithering to two colors only: black &amp; white. Multi-color dithering is possible, but it will not be covered here.</p><p>There are many ways to build a threshold map, each creating a unique visual pattern.</p><p>I&#39;ll guide you through how it works and how it forms those unique patterns.</p><p>Please note that this isn’t a technical deep-dive. It’s just a visual exploration of the logic behind ordered dithering.</p><p>I personally grasp ideas much better when I can see them visually, so I hope this helps you too!</p><p>Let’s start!</p><p>First, a quick recap on quantization: the process of reducing colors in an image.</p><p>Grayscale images use many shades, from black to white.</p><p>Now, imagine our display can only show pure black and white.</p><p>We must convert those gray shades into black or white. This is what quantization does.</p><p>One way is by rounding: dark shades become black, and bright shades become white.</p><p>Another way is by setting a threshold. Anything below it turns black; anything above it turns white.</p><p>The threshold controls the quantization output: lower thresholds can turn darker shades white, while higher ones can turn brighter shades black.</p><p>Now, imagine using multiple thresholds at once, each with a different value.</p><p>Quantizing a single color now gives us a mix of black and white pixels.</p><p>The result reflects the original brightness: brighter inputs get more whites, while darker inputs get more blacks.</p><p>This is essentially how a threshold map works in ordered dithering.</p><p>It converts gray shades into black &amp; white patterns that mimic the original image&#39;s brightness.</p><p>Now let’s try to apply this map to a full image by tiling it across the entire area.</p><p>Our image is now converted to black &amp; white, but something is off. See those vertical line artifacts?</p><p>They are formed by the horizontal black &amp; white patterns our map produces.</p><p>The problem is that the output directly mirrors the map&#39;s layout.</p><p>To fix this, we need to rearrange the threshold map.</p><p>Introducing: The Bayer matrix.</p><p>The thresholds are arranged in a 2x2 matrix, like this.</p><p>When applied, it generates this signature cross-hatch pattern.</p><p>This pattern keeps black and white pixels apart, preventing unwanted artifacts like those vertical lines.</p><p>The result is a uniform dispersion of black &amp; white pixels that blend smoothly into shades of gray.</p><p>Now while this looks better, we still have a problem: the transitions between shades are quite harsh.</p><p>The issue? With only 4 threshold levels, we only have 4 patterns to represent the entire grayscale shades.</p><p>To improve this, we need to increase the number of our output patterns.</p><p>Here is a 4x4 Bayer matrix, which has 16 different threshold values.</p><p>It&#39;s an extension of the 2x2 matrix. Notice how the sequence is similar, just with different starting values.</p><p>Like the 2x2 version, it creates a cross-hatch pattern. But now with 16 distinct pattern variations.</p><p>These extra patterns allow us to represent 16 unique shades of gray instead of just four.</p><p>As a result, we get smoother transitions between shades.</p><p>This reduces harsh transitions between shadows and highlights in the final image.</p><p>And that’s ordered dithering in a nutshell!</p><p>In summary, it uses a threshold map to translate shades into cleverly arranged patterns.</p><p>Now you might ask, can we use even more threshold levels? Or, can we arrange them differently?</p><p>The answer is yes! The threshold map&#39;s arrangement is what creates those unique dithering patterns. Let’s explore a few other ways to arrange them.</p><p>This is the pattern coming from an 8x8 Bayer Matrix. With 64 levels, it’s a further extension of the versions we’ve seen so far.</p><p>It still has a similar cross-hatch pattern but offers even smoother transitions between shades.</p><p>It provides a denser and more detailed gradient, although the difference is fairly subtle.</p><p>Now let’s look beyond the Bayer family with this pattern coming from a 8x8 Cluster Dot matrix.</p><p>It consists of round dot clusters, quite different from Bayer’s cross-hatching.</p><p>It gives the image the classic, familiar feel of a printed newspaper.</p><p>Finally, my favorite method: Void and Cluster.</p><p>blue noise</p><p>The result is a pattern that feels less rigid than the Bayer cross-hatch.</p><p>In the final image, this creates a fine texture that blends into grays more naturally.</p><p>That’s all for now! There are still some more maps to explore, but we’ll save those for another time.</p><p>If you want more examples and details, here are some resources you might want to explore:</p><p>• Libcaca study - 2. Halftoning</p><p>• Ditherpunk — The article I wish I had about monochrome image dithering</p><p>• Robert Ulichney&#39;s paper on void-and-cluster dithering</p><p>I hope you enjoy what you read so far! In the next part, we’ll look at another dithering method that doesn&#39;t use a map at all: Error Diffusion.</p><p>Thanks for reading!
