    <h1>Schemes for Indirect Control</h1>

<p>There are two fundamental approaches to indirect control in code.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In an <em>open</em> approach, we can change the behavior of dereferencing code by conveying different values. The decision-making mechanism must be unordered. Typically, this is implemented in code using a data structure with a distinct set of keys, i.e. a <em>lookup table</em>.</p>
<p>In a <em>closed</em> approach, we can only change the decision-making process by changing the underlying code. A conditional, e.g. an expression that uses an <code>if/elif/else</code> or <code>match/case</code> form in Python, is closed. It is ordered, and if predicates aren’t disjoint, order matters.</p>
<p>While an open table <em>conveys</em> values, a conditional <em>decides</em> based on values. For a table to be useful, it must avoid conflicts. Conditionals avoid conflicts by making explicit, fixed decisions. An open approach must avoid conflicts in a dynamic way.</p>
<p>Consider all the kinds of tricks we use to try to force ourselves to work when we’re tired or distracted:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Willpower</em>: Tell yourself, “Don’t give in to that,” or, “Keep on trying.”</li>
<li><em>Activity</em>: Move around. Exercise. Inhale. Shout.</li>
<li><em>Expression</em>: Set jaw. Stiffen upper lip. Furrow brow.</li>
<li><em>Chemistry</em>: Take coffee, amphetamines, or other brain-affecting drugs.</li>
<li><em>Emotion</em>: “If I win, there’s much to gain, but more to lose if I fail!”</li>
<li><em>Attachment</em>: Imagine admiration if you succeed – or disapproval if you fail – especially from those to whom you are attached.</li>
</ul>
<p>So many schemes for self-control! How do we choose which ones to use? There isn’t any easy way. Self-discipline takes years to learn; it grows inside us stage by stage.</p>
