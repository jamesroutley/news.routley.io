      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Two weeks ago, I announced (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31598978) that I was shutting down my companies, 70 Million Jobs and Commissary Club (companies that helped the formerly incarcerated get on with their lives). The overwhelming volume of support I received just through Bookface and Hacker News stunned me; my heart overflowed with pride and gratitude.<p>Now I am facing another challenge: I need a job. I’ve spoken with many recruiters and HR professionals, along with people who are interested in either acquiring my company(s), funding them or just want to make themselves available for a chat. I’ve received offers for leadership positions at nonprofits, but I haven’t yet discovered the right fit. Maybe I love the startup life too much. Maybe my criminal record hurts my chances. (Maybe!?!) Maybe my age is a deterrent.</p><p>Before I accept a position that doesn’t thrill me, I thought I’d get the word out to the YC community. Perhaps your company has—or has been considering—beginning a foundation or some other mission-based, social impact endeavor. Perhaps you need to hire lots of folks for your work force and want to seriously access the largely ignored 70 million Americans with records. I can help.</p><p>What else am I very good at? Business development, sales training and management.</p><p>Please note: I’m not very technical.</p><p>If you’ve got ideas, I’d love to hear them. Thanks for your time and consideration.</p></td></tr>
