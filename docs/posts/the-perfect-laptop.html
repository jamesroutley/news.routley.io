    <h1>The Perfect Laptop</h1>

      <p>The TL;DR is <a href="#the-perfect-laptop">down here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Personal preference is an interesting thing.
People can have a particular preference for something until they are able to experience something else.
As we gain experience, our personal preference gets more finely tuned.</p>
<p>I’ve probably owned 20 or more laptops over the years.
I remember two cheap consumer-grade laptops I bought early on in my life of laptop ownership.
They were Gateways, a 14&#34; early on (AMD Turion X2 model) that I ended up selling to a client.
This particular model would come to bite me later on in life when it refused to run a modern operating system.
Not long after, I got another Gateway: a dirt cheap Black Friday deal (back when these were still great deals)
with an Intel chip that I had installed Windows Server 2003 on.
I couldn’t tell you now the reason for that,
I suppose I was in to plugging it in to networks and having it do “server things” at the time.
This laptop was stolen out of the back of my car behind a shopping center.</p>
<p>Before I owned those two laptops (which in retrospect I would describe as atrocious)
I worked as a computer repair technician in a computer shop (remember those?).
It was a great job for a teenager,
I remember asking the owner of the shop if I could have a broken laptop he had in a cardboard box in the “old parts room”.
It was an old IBM ThinkPad 600e, and it would become my first personal laptop.
I would spend the day fixing consumer grade Sony Vaios that would cost thousands,
and bargain basement Toshibas that came from the factory with gigabytes of junkware.
But I kept going back to this ancient Pentium II powered laptop,
amidst the Pentium 4s and Core-based machines that were the laptop of the day.
At the time, I couldn’t figure out why I was drawn to this laptop.
I realize now there was something about the way it felt.
The way the keyboard felt.
The way the screen hinges moved.
Partly it was because I had pieced it together from spare parts,
a 2.5&#34; hard drive some customer replaced with a larger capacity drive…
a memory module and charger I found in other boxes of spare parts.</p>
<p>Since the laptop was terribly outdated even at the time
I experimented with Linux (Slackware of course!) on it.
While just working on the hardware of the machine
I found there was a real difference in the build quality and repair experience on this
old gem.</p>
<p>The experienced technician (probably 20 years my senior) I shared an office with remarked,
“Oh, the ThinkPads… those things are tanks, easy to fix too,
look how many different kinds of screws they use”
as he pointed to a pile of screws of all the same length.</p>
<p>That was the moment I began to appreciate the engineering that goes into making a laptop.</p>
<p>Later more consumer-grade laptops came and went.</p>
<p>Eventually I came back around to the ThinkPad.
This time a Job bought me a Lenovo x201.
I got a good deal on it, as it was a generation or two old by the time I got it,
but this was the best laptop I had ever used.</p>
<p>I used it for many years.
In fact, I had continued using it far past what many would consider it’s usable lifetime.
At the time I found it to be the perfect size.
The keyboard, which I wouldn’t explicitly appreciate until some time later, was also sublime.
It’s speakers were garbage, but I was a headphone guy.</p>
<p>There was something about the screen though that I didn’t like.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what it was until I started experiencing Apple’s latest.
I had worked on older PowerPC Apple laptops in the past,
but I suppose they never really appealed to me.</p>
<p>There was something about the screen on the MacBook that made me realize
screens on other laptops were severely lacking.
I finally broke down and bought a 2015 MacBook Pro in 2018 (brand new) at the height
of the keyboard fiasco.
Once I had the experience of the MacBook Pro’s excellent screen,
I had to quantify what made this one so much better.</p>
<p>The two specifications that made the largest impact were:
Brightness (nits).  Aspect ratio (16:10).</p>
<p>The “retina” marketing of the Apple displays was also apparent,
but at the time most laptops came with at least a 1920x1080 resolution display.</p>
<p>I currently own: 2020 MacBook Pro (the 4 port one with Intel CPU),
a Lenovo x201, and a Lenovo x220.</p>
<p>So, with the background out of the way, I’d like to quantify what, In my opinion,
would make up the perfect laptop today.</p>
<h2 id="the-perfect-laptop">The Perfect Laptop</h2>
<p>The perfect laptop has:</p>
<ul>
<li>a 13&#34; to 14&#34; screen with at least a 16:10 ratio, if not taller (how to calculate? <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>)
<ul>
<li>2560x1600 is a great resolution to start with, 1920x1200 at a minimum</li>
<li>400 nits or greater brightness, we need to be able to use it in various lighting conditions</li>
<li>reasonable color reproduction, the colors shouldn’t be washed out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the body of a 12&#34; laptop
<ul>
<li>to fit the 13&#34; to 14&#34; screen it would have very small bezels,
this is a great size for fitting in bags and sitting on small tables</li>
<li>the body need not be ridiculously thin, needlessly sacrificing performance and battery power</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>webcam that doesn’t make it look like your laptop (or you) are a potato during a videoconference
<ul>
<li>it doesn’t have to be super high resolution, just a quality image with good light management</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>excellent build quality
<ul>
<li>this is more important than being lightweight</li>
<li>milled aluminum or magnesium chassis are nice, but even just high quality composites and plastics are fine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a great keyboard, look to the 2008-11 era ThinkPads for inspiration</li>
<li>a large, quality touchpad backed by great software
<ul>
<li>another Apple <em>can’t put my finger on why this is so much better than everyone else</em> things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>excellent performance, excellent battery life
<ul>
<li>certainly a sliding scale, but I’m anxiously awaiting the industry’s response to Apple’s M1 line of processors, these are currently unmatched in the space <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the ability to run whatever operating system I want
<ul>
<li>within reason, is it reasonable to want to be able to run MacOS, Windows, Linux, BSD?
the perfect laptop is truly the the laptop for everyone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>excellent repairability
<ul>
<li>also the ability to upgrade the basics, like memory and storage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>good quality DAC or audio interface (headphone jack), this is also something Apple tends to do a little better than competitors</li>
<li>a useful number of ports
<ul>
<li>a 1/8&#34; headphone and microphone combo port is a must</li>
<li>it should at least have an HDMI port, some USB-C/Thunderbolt ports, and until the world is completely switched over to USB-C ports, probably a couple USB-A ports as well</li>
<li>an SD card reader, why not, they’re $5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reasonably priced (certainly under $2000, ideally under $1500 with a great spec)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a short list of laptops currently on the market that come as near as they can to “The Perfect Laptop”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple M1 MacBook line (from Air to the lower end Pro)</li>
<li><a href="https://frame.work/">The Framework Laptop</a></li>
<li>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano Gen 2</li>
<li>Lenovo ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 (AMD)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, none of these are 100% there yet.
I’m excited to see what Qualcomm or Intel responds to the M1 processors with,
and to see what Framework and Lenovo does with them.</p>
<p>The fact that an amalgam of these laptops could be “The Perfect Laptop” means it’s certainly possible</p>
