    <h1>You shouldn&#39;t parse the output of ls(1)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="ltr" id="content" lang="en">
<p>The <tt>ls(1)</tt> command is pretty good at showing you the attributes of a single file (at least in some cases), but when you ask it for a <em>list</em> of files, there&#39;s a huge problem: Unix allows almost any character in a filename, including whitespace, newlines, commas, pipe symbols, and pretty much anything else you&#39;d ever try to use as a delimiter except NUL. There are <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fixing-unix-linux-filenames.html">proposals</a> to try and &#34;fix&#34; this within <a href="https://www.everipedia.com/posix/">POSIX</a>, but they won&#39;t help in dealing with the current situation (see also <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html">how to deal with filenames correctly</a>).  In its default mode, if standard output isn&#39;t a terminal, <tt>ls</tt> separates filenames with newlines.  This is fine until you have a file with a newline in its name.  And since I don&#39;t know of any implementation of <tt>ls</tt> that allows you to terminate filenames with NUL characters instead of newlines, this leaves us unable to get a list of filenames safely with <tt>ls</tt>. <span id="line-3"></span><span id="line-4"></span></p><pre><span id="line-1"></span>$ touch &#39;a space&#39; $&#39;a\nnewline&#39;

<span id="line-6"></span>newline
<span id="line-7"></span>a space</pre><p>This output appears to indicate that we have two files called <tt>a</tt>, one called <tt>newline</tt> and one called <tt>a space</tt>. <span id="line-15"></span><span id="line-16"></span></p><p>Using <tt>ls -l</tt> we can see that this isn&#39;t true at all: <span id="line-17"></span><span id="line-18"></span></p><pre><span id="line-1-1"></span>$ ls -l

<span id="line-5-1"></span>-rw-r-----  1 lhunath  lhunath   0 Mar 27 10:47 a space</pre><p>The problem is that from the output of <tt>ls</tt>, neither you or the computer can tell what parts of it constitute a filename.  Is it each word? No. Is it each line?  No.  There is no correct answer to this question other than: you can&#39;t tell. <span id="line-27"></span><span id="line-28"></span></p><p>Also notice how <tt>ls</tt> sometimes garbles your filename data (in our case, it turned the newline character in between the words &#34;<tt>a</tt>&#34; and &#34;<tt>newline</tt>&#34; into a question mark.  Some systems put a <tt>\n</tt> instead.).  On some systems it doesn&#39;t do this when its output isn&#39;t a terminal, on others it always mangles the filename.  All in all, you really can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t trust the output of <tt>ls</tt> to be a true representation of the filenames that you want to work with.  So don&#39;t. <span id="line-29"></span><span id="line-30"></span></p><p>Now that we&#39;ve seen the problem, let&#39;s explore various ways of coping with it.  As usual, we have to start by figuring out <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem">what we actually want to do</a>. <span id="line-31"></span><span id="line-32"></span></p><p><tt>ls</tt> in GNU coreutils &gt;= 8.25 now correctly shell-escapes the filenames <a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=coreutils.git;a=commitdiff;h=109b9220cead6e979d22d16327c4d9f8350431cc">when printing to a terminal</a>.

<p>When people try to use <tt>ls</tt> to get a list of filenames (either all files, or files that match a <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob">glob</a>, or files sorted in some way) things fail disastrously. <span id="line-36"></span><span id="line-37"></span></p><p>If you just want to iterate over all the files in the current directory, use a <tt>for</tt> loop and a <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob">glob</a>: <span id="line-38"></span><span id="line-39"></span></p><pre><span id="line-1-2"></span># Good!

If you want the oldest or newest file in a directory, don&#39;t use <tt>ls -t | head -1</tt> -- read <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/099">Bash FAQ 99</a> instead.  If you truly need a list of <em>all</em> the files in a directory in order by <tt>mtime</tt> so that you can process them in sequence, switch to perl, and have your perl program do its own directory opening and sorting.  Then do the processing in the perl program, or -- worst case scenario -- have the perl program spit out the filenames with NUL delimiters. <span id="line-95"></span><span id="line-96"></span></p><p>Even better, put the modification time <em>in</em> the filename, in YYYYMMDD format, so that <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob">glob</a> order is also mtime order.  Then you don&#39;t need <tt>ls</tt> or perl or anything.  (The <em>vast</em> majority of cases where people want the oldest or newest file in a directory can be solved just by doing this.) <span id="line-97"></span><span id="line-98"></span></p><p>You could patch <tt>ls</tt> to support a <tt>--null</tt> option and submit the patch to your OS vendor.  That should have been done about 15 years ago.  (In fact, people <em>tried</em>, and it was rejected!  <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs#coreutils">See below</a>.) <span id="line-99"></span><span id="line-100"></span></p><p>Of course, the reason that wasn&#39;t done is because very few people <em>really</em> need the sorting of <tt>ls</tt> in their scripts.  Mostly, when people want a list of filenames, they use <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/UsingFind">find(1)</a> instead, because they don&#39;t care about the order.  And BSD/GNU <tt>find</tt> has had the ability to terminate filenames with NULs for a very long time. <span id="line-101"></span><span id="line-102"></span></p><p>So, instead of this: <span id="line-103"></span><span id="line-104"></span></p><pre><span id="line-1-8"></span># Bad!  Don&#39;t!
<span id="line-2-8"></span>ls | while read filename; do
<span id="line-3-8"></span>  ...
<span id="line-4-8"></span>done</pre><p>Try this: <span id="line-112"></span><span id="line-113"></span></p><pre><span id="line-1-9"></span># Be aware that this does not do the same as above. This goes recursive and lists only on normal files (i.e. no dirs or symlinks). It may work for some situation but is not at all a replacement for the above.
<span id="line-2-9"></span>find . -type f -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d &#39;&#39; filename; do
<span id="line-3-9"></span>  ...
<span id="line-4-9"></span>done</pre><p>Even better, most people don&#39;t really want a list of filenames.  They want to <em>do things</em> to files instead.  The list is just an <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem">intermediate step to accomplishing some real goal</a>, such as <em>change www.mydomain.com to mydomain.com in every *.html file</em>.  <tt>find</tt> can pass filenames directly to another command.   There is usually no need to write the filenames out in a straight line and then rely on some other program to read the stream and separate the names back out. <span id="line-121"></span><span id="line-122"></span></p>
<p>If you&#39;re after the file&#39;s size, the portable method is to use <tt>wc</tt> instead: <span id="line-124"></span><span id="line-125"></span></p><pre><span id="line-1-10"></span># POSIX
<span id="line-2-10"></span>size=$(wc -c &lt; &#34;$file&#34;)</pre><p>Most implementations of <tt>wc</tt> will detect that stdin is a regular file, and get the size by calling <tt>fstat(2)</tt>.  However, this is not guaranteed.  Some implementations may actually read all the bytes. <span id="line-131"></span><span id="line-132"></span></p><p>Other metadata is often hard to get at in a portable way.  <tt>stat(1)</tt> is not available on every platform, and when it is, it often takes a completely different syntax of arguments.  There is no way to use <tt>stat</tt> in a way that it won&#39;t break for the next POSIX system you run the script on. Though, if you&#39;re OK with that, both the GNU implementations of <tt>stat(1)</tt> and <tt>find(1)</tt> (via the <tt>-printf</tt> option) are very good ways to get file information, depending upon whether you want it for a single file or multiple files. AST <tt>find</tt> also has <tt>-printf</tt>, but again with incompatible formats, and it&#39;s much less common than GNU <tt>find</tt>. <span id="line-133"></span><span id="line-134"></span></p><pre><span id="line-1-11"></span># GNU
