    <h1>Japan&#39;s Moon lander makes it through another lunar night</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Japan&#39;s Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) has woken up again, having survived three lunar nights.</p>
<p>A <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/SLIM_JAXA/status/1783330118683050427">post</a> on social media from the lander&#39;s X account confirmed that once more, SLIM had defied the odds and snapped a picture of the lunar surface using its navigation camera.</p>
<p>SLIM was revived <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/02/jaxa_slim_awakens/">a few weeks ago</a>, after a second lunar night. However, with telemetry showing that some of the electronics (temperature sensors) and battery cells were <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/SLIM_JAXA/status/1773162603075821881">malfunctioning</a>, the chances of the lander making it through a third lunar night seemed remote.</p>

    

<p>Yet against all odds, SLIM has stirred once more on the lunar surface despite lacking heaters to keep its electronics warm.</p>

        


        

<p>Spacecraft designed to survive extreme cold are usually constructed with heaters to keep electronics toasty. The surface temperature on the Moon can drop below −150°C, and the temperature in some craters can get as low as −247°C.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/SLIM_JAXA/status/1783330326850503075">According</a> to SLIM&#39;s social media presence: &#34;SLIM has maintained main functionality even after three nights on the Moon, which was not anticipated in the design!</p>

<p>&#34;SLIM&#39;s condition will be monitored to clarify areas where deterioration has progressed due to the day and night environments, and where there is less susceptibility.&#34;</p>
<p>SLIM was only designed to last until the end of its first lunar day on the Moon&#39;s surface. The mission was initially declared a &#34;minimum success&#34; because the lander tipped onto its side during the landing, meaning that it could not achieve all the intended goals.</p>

        

<p>Despite this, SLIM has exceeded all endurance expectations and come around after a third lunar night.</p>
<p>JAXA gave no indication as to whether SLIM might survive a fourth lunar night or the state of the lander&#39;s electronics. At the start of April, hopes that a third night might be survivable were tempered with a warning that &#34;the sensors and other functions are gradually being lost.&#34;</p>
<p>As we said in our earlier coverage: &#34;Here&#39;s to as many more lunar sunrises as you can manage.&#34; ®</p>
