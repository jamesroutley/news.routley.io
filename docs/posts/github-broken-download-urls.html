    <h1>GitHub Broken Download URLs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div disabled="" sortable="">
  <div>
            <p dir="auto">I don&#39;t use releases much, so I may very well be misunderstanding this.  Take what I&#39;m saying with a large grain of salt.</p>
<p dir="auto">I wanted to note that of the URLs that Davorpa put up, only the first two are broken.  The third, which he lists as <code>expected</code>, actually works.</p>
<p dir="auto">I looked at one of my projects which has releases set up.  I tried recreating the <code>.../releases/latest/download...</code> url for it.</p>
<p dir="auto">That sends it to my equivalent of his redirect URL, which fails as his does.</p>
<p dir="auto">When I recreate his &#34;expected&#34; URL for my project, it works as his does.  (Mine needs a <code>v</code> in front of the version number.  It&#39;s not clear if that&#39;s meaningful or not.)</p>
<p dir="auto">At this time I wonder whether either</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The redirect is going to the wrong URL, or</li>
<li>Multiple URLs should be supported here but only some survive</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The releases link on the repo webpage points to the <code>Expected</code> structure link, and works correctly.</p>
<p dir="auto">I can&#39;t find a &#34;how this is actually supposed to work&#34; document, by which I could state clearly whether my repo is working as expected.</p>
