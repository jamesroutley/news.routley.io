				<p>According to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/646880/confidence-higher-education-closely-divided.aspx" target="_blank">a new Gallup poll</a>, Americans are losing the thread with higher education. Confidence in college has taken a nosedive, with one out of three poll responders claiming they have “little or no confidence” in higher education. This contrasts sharply with a 2015 poll, when 57% of those surveyed claimed to to be fairly or “very” confident in the old hallowed halls.</p>
<p>Poll responders <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/646880/confidence-higher-education-closely-divided.aspx" target="_blank">cited several reasons</a> for a rising ambivalence. But among these, “pushing political agendas, not teaching relevant skills, and being overly expensive,” took the cake. The faith-ebbing trend holds true across all demographics surveyed. Though conservatives skewed quite a bit angrier as a block, with Republicans citing fear of liberal “indoctrination” as a big reason for foregoing four-year-ed.</p>
<p>Perhaps this news won’t shock you to your socks, considering the interlocking crises of 1) <a href="https://www.luminafoundation.org/news-and-views/sticker-shock-americans-say-college-costs-are-too-high-and-unclear/" target="_blank">un-affordability</a>, 2) fresh light on the <a href="https://knowyourdebt.debtcollective.org/student" target="_blank">scam that is student loans</a>, 3) an unpromising job market with diminishing returns for un-STEM professions and 3) the many tortured varietals of “free speech” discourse. Every corner of academia is famously in trouble, from <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher-ed-gamma/adjunctification-gen-ed-0" target="_blank">adjuncts</a> to alumni.</p>
<p>And considering too how <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/student-journalists-campus-repression-palestine-protests/" target="_blank">poorly students have been treated by the mainstream media</a>, I’m personally hard-pressed to imagine the high-ed advocate who <em>could</em> claim full confidence in The University. Still, it’s striking that responders are citing more than material objections. Increasingly, to-college or not-to-college feels like an ethical question.</p>
<p>Even if today’s young person goes in knowing that their private college humanities degree could prove professionally useless, it was plausible till recently that such a degree could at least yield cryptic intellectual benefits.</p>
<p>In a 2020 piece for <em>The New Republic</em>, Dr. Wim Wiewel of Lewis &amp; Clark University outlined <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/157845/case-liberal-arts-college-coronavirus-crisis" target="_blank">three core goals of a liberal arts education</a>: “to encourage lifelong exploration of the self and one’s own values; to develop the skills needed to embark on meaningful careers; and to prepare for full, and civil, participation in public life.” This rubric surely conveys the enlightenment-era tea yours truly was sipping, when I elected to take on a BFA for a six figure ticket price. But such benefits look starry-eyed from here.</p>
<p>These days, there are very different corridors for “civil participation.” And, thanks to an <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2022-in-review/the-year-in-quiet-quitting" target="_blank">ongoing interrogation of office life under capitalism</a>, the definition of a “meaningful career” isn’t static, either. “Public life” is increasingly siloed, too, in a country where large parts of the population <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/09/15/deconstructed-naomi-klein-doppelganger-book/" target="_blank">fail to agree on basic tenets of reality</a>. Let alone how schools should operate.</p>
<p>This is all to say: I get it, youth of America. Ad hoc classes plus robust hobbies plus library creepin’ plus learning a trade with a strong union looks more and more reasonable to me, as a life plan. And a(n unscientifically conducted) poll of the Lit Hub masthead seems to agree. But to each their own.</p>
<p>It could also be a matter of time. As the Gallup poll notes, confidence in community college and two year programs is up.</p>
