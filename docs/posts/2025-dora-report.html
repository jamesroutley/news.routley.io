In our report, <a href="http://cloud.google.com/dora">State of AI-assisted Software Development</a>, we surveyed nearly 5,000 technology professionals globally, validating what we all suspected: the way software is built has profoundly changed.</p><p data-block-key="1cc80">Google Cloud’s <a href="https://dora.dev/">DORA research program</a> has been investigating the capabilities, practices and measures of high-performing technology-driven teams and organizations for more than a decade. And our 2025 research makes it clear that AI is no longer a novelty, but a near-universal part of a developer’s toolkit.</p><h2 data-block-key="3eb15">Massive adoption meets major productivity gains</h2><p data-block-key="crm6d">This year&#39;s report reveals a significant finding: AI adoption among software development professionals has surged to 90%, marking a 14% increase from last year. These professionals, from developers to product managers, now integrate AI into their core workflows, typically dedicating a median of two hours daily to working with it.</p></div>

        <div><h2 data-block-key="ktza1">A trust and productivity paradox</h2><p data-block-key="34ti">Despite the widespread adoption and perceived benefits, some software development professionals remain cautious about using AI in their work. Our report uncovers a surprising &#34;trust paradox&#34;: While 24% of respondents report a &#34;great deal&#34; (4%) or &#34;a lot&#34; (20%) of trust in AI, 30% trust it &#34;a little&#34; (23%) or &#34;not at all&#34; (7%). This indicates that AI outputs are perceived as useful and valuable by many of this year’s survey respondents, despite a lack of complete trust in them. This could also imply that AI is being incorporated into workflows as a supportive tool to enhance productivity and efficiency, rather than serving as a full substitute for human judgment.</p><p data-block-key="dv21q">While AI is boosting individual performance, its effect on organizations is more complex. This year&#39;s research shows that AI adoption is now linked to higher software delivery throughput, meaning teams are releasing more software and applications, which is a positive reversal of last year&#39;s findings. However, the ongoing challenge remains of ensuring software works as intended before it&#39;s delivered to users.</p><h2 data-block-key="emsko">Reflections on how teams work</h2><p data-block-key="4pl86">Our research this year also found that AI can act as a &#34;mirror and a multiplier.” In cohesive organizations, AI boosts efficiency. In fragmented ones, it highlights weaknesses.</p><p data-block-key="2i9nr">To better understand these underlying conditions, this year&#39;s report moves beyond simple performance metrics to reveal seven distinct team archetypes, providing a deeper, more human-centric view of what drives success in AI adoption. These profiles, from &#34;Harmonious high-achievers&#34; to teams caught in a &#34;Legacy bottleneck,&#34; offer a richer narrative that can help organizations understand the unique interplay between performance, well-being and workplace environment.</p><p data-block-key="5i7q5">For organizations ready to adopt AI, new tools can help them evolve their work processes - meaning they benefit from both the productivity boost and the resulting transformation.</p><h2 data-block-key="aijaj">A blueprint for guiding AI in organizations</h2><p data-block-key="2l1dc">Adoption of AI alone isn&#39;t enough to guarantee success though. That’s why this year, we’re also introducing a new blueprint of seven essential capabilities for amplifying AI&#39;s impact. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-doras-inaugural-ai-capabilities-model">The DORA AI Capabilities Model</a> is based on extensive research and identifies a blend of technical and cultural factors that are crucial for success.</p></div>
