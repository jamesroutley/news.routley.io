People ask me what I mean by this. </p><p>That’s a a reasonable question, but the new normal defies simple explanation. At some point, I hope to write in-depth on this subject. But today I will simply offer a quick definition, and then share 14 tweets. </p><p>These capture the flavor of what I’m trying to express better than any long-winded analysis.</p><p>First, here’s a quick definition. These are the key indicators that you might be living in a society without a counterculture:</p><ul><li><p>A sense of sameness pervades the creative world</p></li><li><p>The dominant themes feel static and repetitive, not dynamic and impactful</p></li><li><p>Imitation of the conventional is rewarded</p></li><li><p>Movies, music, and other creative pursuits are increasingly evaluated on financial and corporate metrics, with all other considerations having little influence</p></li><li><p>Alternative voices exist—in fact, they are everywhere—but are rarely heard, and their cultural impact is negligible</p></li><li><p>Every year the same stories are retold, and this sameness is considered a plus</p></li><li><p>Creative work is increasingly embedded in genres that feel rigid, not flexible</p></li><li><p>Even avant-garde work often feels like a rehash of 50-60 years ago</p></li><li><p>Etc. etc. etc. </p></li></ul><p>This is a deep matter, and I won’t try to unlock all the nuances here. I will now simply share 14 tweets that capture the stale taste of life without a counterculture. Some of these tweets are my own, others from total strangers—but they all paint the same overall picture.</p><h4><em>The Honest Broker</em> is a reader-supported guide to music, books, and culture.

Every screen shows the same movie.</h4><h4>2. Alt Weeklies disappear in every city—along with everything else that’s alternative or outside the norm.</h4><h4>3. The most popular song doesn’t change for three years in a row.</h4><h4>4. The banal word ‘content’ is used to describe every type of creative work, implying that artistry is generic and interchangeable.</h4><h4>5. There are lots of journalists, but they all seem to be working for the same corporations.</h4><h4>6. The dominant company in the creative culture views everything as a brand extension.</h4><h4>7. Indie music and alt music are marginalized.</h4><h4>8. Telling jokes becomes a dangerous profession.</h4><h4>9. The experts who ‘explain’ the culture to us all seem to be insiders with identical backgrounds.</h4><h4>10. This year’s movies look a lot like last year’s movies.</h4><h4>11. Even elite awards for creativity are dominated by reboots and remakes.</h4><h4>12. Five companies have almost complete control over the book business—where, in an earlier day, dozens of indie publishers thrived.</h4><h4>13. Everybody is encouraged to watch the same TV shows and movies—with niche options gradually removed from the dominant platforms.</h4><h4>14.  All those nasty, rebellious songs that defy authorities are now owned by hedge funds.</h4></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
