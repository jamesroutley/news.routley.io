    <h1>Crabs evolved at least five times from separate groups of crustaceans (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It&#39;s true: Crabs keep turning up in nature, and it&#39;s bothering scientists so much that they&#39;ve been given federal grants to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>The phenomenon is so widely known that it&#39;s been given a name—carcinization, a term that&#39;s been in use for over 140 years. Through this process, crabs, the beach critters we all know and love, have evolved at least five times from separate groups of crustaceans, <em>Newsweek</em> has been told.</p><p>These groups had one common ancestor, but over 300 million years ago. That means there&#39;s been a lot of time for evolution, but still the crabs keep coming.</p><p>&#34;Carcinization can be defined as the evolutionary process leading to the crab-like form,&#34; said Heather Bracken-Grissom, associate professor at the Institute of Environment and Department of Biological Sciences at Florida International University, who has been studying the phenomenon.</p><p>&#34;We know the process has occurred multiple times and our current grant is aimed at better understanding the drivers and implications.&#34;</p>

</figure><p>Not all the species to have undergone carcinization have become crabs in the technical sense. Some have merely become crab-like, adopting their shape and form. Carcinized species can be divided into two main groups: Brachyura, which are true crabs, and Anomura, or false crabs.</p><p>But it still poses the question: What makes <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/most-advanced-crab-leaves-unimpressed-internet-arguing-over-superior-species-1592595" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the crab shape so successful</a> that species keep trying to emulate it?</p><p>Joanna Wolfe, a researcher at the Department of Organismic &amp; Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University, has been looking into this.</p><p>&#34;At least five groups of decapod crustaceans have evolved a crab-like body form,&#34; she told <em>Newsweek</em>. These include most eubrachyurans—the group which includes most land crabs—plus sponge crabs, porcelain crabs, king crabs and the hairy stone crab.</p><p>So how do these creatures end up so crabby? The process of carcinization involves adopting various crab-like characteristics, Wolfe explained, like a flattened, often round carapace (upper shell), and a pleon (abdomen) that is folded under the body.</p><h2>Searching for a Reason</h2><p>Why they do this is another question. &#34;We are still not sure,&#34; said Wolfe. &#34;The pleon being folded under the body makes a smaller target for predators. Perhaps crabs are better able to fit into small places to hide. Perhaps they can move faster with the ability to walk sideways.</p><p>&#34;But there isn&#39;t yet direct experimental evidence comparing carcinized and uncarcinized forms as to how they may perform at some of these strategies.&#34;</p><p>It could be assumed that crabs are some sort of ultimate evolutionary form, but the experts say that is not the case.</p><p>&#34;Whatever the advantages are, they do not apply in all habitats because some groups have also lost carcinization; one modern example being the frog crab.&#34;</p><p>Wolfe and Bracken-Grissom&#39;s area of study aims partly to find out whether crab-like evolutionary forms can be predicted. Thankfully, neither of them thinks that <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/human-evolution-weird-anatomical-feature-1537486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans are likely to turn into crabs</a> any time soon.</p><p>Their 2021 study on the topic, <em>How to become a crab: Phenotypic constraints on a recurring body plan</em>, was published in the journal BioEssays in March.</p><p><em>Update 14/10/21, 10:18 a.m. EDT: This article has been updated to clarify which crabs are eubrachyurans.</em></p><figure><div><picture width="790" height="527"><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 992px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1913282/crab.webp?w=790&amp;f=44622e0933d1a2b5f39d23cede40b092 1x"/><source type="image/jpeg" media="(min-width: 992px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1913282/crab.jpg?w=790&amp;f=44622e0933d1a2b5f39d23cede40b092 1x"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1913282/crab.webp?w=900&amp;f=a4ef0d3c3d7b340025c54dd290a5d0f1 1x"/><source type="image/jpeg" media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1913282/crab.jpg?w=900&amp;f=a4ef0d3c3d7b340025c54dd290a5d0f1 1x"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 481px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1913282/crab.webp?w=790&amp;f=44622e0933d1a2b5f39d23cede40b092 1x"/><source type="image/jpeg" media="(min-width: 481px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1913282/crab.jpg?w=790&amp;f=44622e0933d1a2b5f39d23cede40b092 1x"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1913282/crab.webp?w=450&amp;f=ce48b12f94634f676727599a24e7936a 1x"/><source type="image/jpeg" media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1913282/crab.jpg?w=450&amp;f=ce48b12f94634f676727599a24e7936a 1x"/><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1913282/crab.webp?w=790&amp;f=44622e0933d1a2b5f39d23cede40b092"/><img loading="lazy" id="i1913282" src="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1913282/crab.jpg?w=790&amp;f=44622e0933d1a2b5f39d23cede40b092" alt="Crab" width="790" height="527"/></picture></div><figcaption>
