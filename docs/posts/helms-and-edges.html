<p>These days I am into dual meanings or multiple meanings.</p>



<p>Two words that have stood out to me in the last few days are Helm and Edge. </p>



<p>Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a system for managing containerized applications. </p>



<p>Kubernetes is an English rendering of the greek word κυβερνητική -pilot. </p>



<p>Helm is the front of a ship, also “the handle or wheel which controls the direction in which a ship or boat”, also the head of something. </p>



<p>I like that middle definition – the helm is a tool. </p>



<p>I also think of Helms deep from The Lord of the Ring. I also thing of the Helm of the astrology chart – which is the ascendant. The ascendant is often referred to as how the world perceives the chart owner. However, if we think about the ascendant as the Helm, then it is what drives the vehicle, the life. </p>



<p>Edges… Edges </p>



<p>One way to think about edges is in graph theory. We have nodes and we have edges. My older kid used to be obsessed with the edge of his train tracks – he would always ask what is an edge. I think about optical illusions as playing with edges. When I paint it is important to pay careful attention to edges. I was reading an article today and the more edges a field has the less vulnerable it is not pests.  Edges are the in between spaces. Edge is also the name of a browser.  Edge can also mean a quality – edgy itself is a quality. </p>



<p>If I were to write an esoteric language it would be a language of edges. maybe I would just represent them as pipes | or _ – / \.  Now I think of super Mario. For some reason my edge language cannot have any bends or curves. = is not an edge it is a symbol – * is a shape. an edge is what makes a shape and a symbol. </p>



<p>A language of edges </p>
