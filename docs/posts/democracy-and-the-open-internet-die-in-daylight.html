			<p><span>O</span>bviously there have been many editorial changes at the formerly venerable Washington Post, a tawdry saga which I don’t intend to recap here.</p>
<p>What I do want to share is this, which I spotted yesterday during research.</p>

<div id="attachment_13182"><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13182" src="https://heatherburns.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-21-at-12.59.43-1024x965.png" alt="A screen cap of the Washington Post&#39;s site, offering free access to Post stories if you download the Comet browser from PerplexityAI" width="960" height="905" srcset="https://heatherburns.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-21-at-12.59.43-1024x965.png 1024w, https://heatherburns.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-21-at-12.59.43-300x283.png 300w, https://heatherburns.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-21-at-12.59.43-1194x1125.png 1194w, https://heatherburns.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-21-at-12.59.43.png 1378w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"/></p><p id="caption-attachment-13182">A screen cap of the Washington Post’s site, offering free access to Post stories if you download the Comet browser from PerplexityAI. The two story masthead images in the background – a floor caked in mud and filth, and an American flag – are inadvertently perfect.</p></div>
<p>In other words – you get free access to news <em>if</em> you download PerplexityAI’s proprietary browser, which is built entirely around <a href="https://observer.com/2025/07/signal-meredith-whittaker-agentic-ai-risk/">agentic AI</a>.</p>
<p><em>*grinds teeth into powder*</em></p>
<p>Leaving aside the idea of access to any form of content being conditional on the use of a proprietary browser, which is a particularly horrid 1990s throwback, I’m going to call this day 0 of an experiment in shifting the funding model of journalism from adtech to agentic AI.</p>
<p>Journalism (or what’s left of it now) is in the state it’s in <em>because</em> of the adtech funding model. I don’t know what the solution is.</p>
<p>But it sure as fuck isn’t trading one privacy-obliterating technology for another, packaged as opportunity.</p>
