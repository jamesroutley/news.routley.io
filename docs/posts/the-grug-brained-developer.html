<p>this collection of thoughts on software development gathered by grug brain developer</p>
<p>grug brain developer not very smart, but grug brain developer program many long year and learn some things
although mostly still confused</p>
<p>grug brain developer try collect learns into small, easily digestible and funny page, not only for you, the young grug, but also for him
because as grug brain developer get older he forget important things, like what had for breakfast or if put pants on</p>
<p>big brained developers are many, and some not expected to like this sour face</p>
<p><em>THINK</em> they are big brained developers many, many more, and many more even definitely probably not like this</p>
<p>(grug once think big brained but learn hard way)</p>
<p>is fine!</p>
<p>is free country sort of and end of day not really matter too much, but grug hope you fun reading and maybe learn from
many, many mistake grug make over long program life</p>

<p>apex predator of grug is complexity</p>
<p>complexity bad</p>
<p>say again:</p>
<p>complexity <em>very</em> bad</p>
<p><em>you</em> say now:</p>
<p>complexity <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> bad</p>
<p>given choice between complexity or one on one against t-rex, grug take t-rex: at least grug see t-rex</p>
<p>complexity is spirit demon that enter codebase through well-meaning but ultimately very clubbable non grug-brain
developers and project managers who not fear complexity spirit demon or even know about sometime</p>
<p>one day code base understandable and grug can get work done, everything good!</p>
<p>next day impossible: complexity demon spirit has entered code and very dangerous situation!</p>
<p>grug no able see complexity demon, but grug sense its presence in code base</p>
<p>demon complexity spirit mocking him make change here break unrelated thing there what!?! mock mock mock ha ha so funny
grug love programming and not becoming shiney rock speculator like grug senior advise</p>
<p>club not work on demon spirit complexity and bad idea actually hit developer who let spirit in with club: sometimes grug
himself!</p>
<p>sadly, often grug himself</p>
<p>so grug say again and say often: complexity <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> bad</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-saying-no"></a><a href="#grug-on-saying-no">Saying No</a></h2>
<p>best weapon against complexity spirit demon is magic word: &#34;no&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;no, grug not build that feature&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;no, grug not build that abstraction&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;no, grug not put water on body every day or drink less black think juice you stop repeat ask now&#34;</p>
<p>note, this good engineering advice but bad career advice: &#34;yes&#34; is magic word for more shiney rock and put in
charge of large tribe of developer</p>
<p>sad but true: learn &#34;yes&#34; then learn blame other grugs when fail, ideal career advice</p>
<p>but grug must to grug be true, and &#34;no&#34; is magic grug word.  Hard say at first, especially if you nice grug and don&#39;t like
disappoint people (many such grugs!) but  easier over time even though shiney rock pile not as high as might otherwise be</p>
<p>is ok: how many shiney rock grug really need anyway?</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-saying-ok"></a><a href="#grug-on-saying-ok">Saying ok</a></h2>
<p>sometimes compromise necessary or no shiney rock, mean no dinosaur meat, not good, wife firmly remind grug
about young grugs at home need roof, food, and so forth, no interest in complexity demon spirit rant by grug for
fiftieth time</p>
<p>in this situation, grug recommend &#34;ok&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;ok, grug build that feature&#34;</p>
<p>then grug spend time think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 solution</a> to problem and build that instead.</p>
<p>sometimes probably best just not tell project manager and do it 80/20 way.  easier forgive than permission, project managers
mind like butterfly at times overworked and dealing with many grugs.  often forget what even feature supposed to do or move on or
quit or get fired grug see many such cases</p>
<p>anyway is in project managers best interest anyway so grug not to feel too bad for this approach usually</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-factring-your-code"></a><a href="#grug-on-factring-your-code">Factoring Your Code</a></h2>
<p>next strategy very harder: break code base up properly (fancy word: &#34;factor your code properly&#34;)  here is hard give general
advice because each system so different.  however, one thing grug come to believe: not factor your application too early!</p>
<p>early on in project everything very abstract and like water: very little solid holds for grug&#39;s struggling brain to hang
on to.  take time to develop &#34;shape&#34; of system and learn what even doing.  grug try not to factor in early part of project
and then, at some point, good cut-points emerge from code base</p>
<p>good cut point has narrow interface with rest of system: small number of functions or abstractions that hide complexity
demon internally, like trapped in crystal</p>
<p>grug quite satisfied when complexity demon trapped properly in crystal, is best feeling to trap mortal enemy!</p>
<p>grug try watch patiently as cut points emerge from code and slowly refactor, with code base taking shape over time along
with experience.  no hard/ fast rule for this: grug know cut point when grug see cut point, just take time to build
skill in seeing, patience</p>
<p>sometimes grug go too early and get abstractions wrong, so grug bias towards waiting</p>
<p>big brain developers often not like this at all and invent many abstractions start of project</p>
<p>grug tempted to reach for club and yell &#34;big brain no maintain code!  big brain move on next architecture committee
leave code for grug deal with!&#34;</p>
<p>but grug learn control passions, major difference between grug and animal</p>
<p>instead grug try to limit damage of big brain developer early in project by giving them thing like
UML diagram (not hurt code, probably throw away anyway) or by demanding working demo tomorrow</p>
<p>working demo especially good trick: force big brain make something to actually work to talk about and code to look at that do
thing, will help big brain see reality on ground more quickly</p>
<p>remember!  big brain have big brain!  need only be harness for good and not in service of spirit complexity demon on
accident, many times seen</p>
<p>(best grug brain able to herd multiple big brain in right direction and produce many complexity demon trap crystals, large
shiney rock pile awaits such grug!)</p>
<p>also sometimes call demo approach &#34;prototype&#34;, sound fancier to project manager</p>
<p>grug say prototype early in software making, <em>especially</em> if many big brains</p>

<p>grug have love/hate relationship with test: test save grug many, many uncountable time and grug love and respect test</p>
<p>unfortunately also many test shamans exist.  some test shaman make test idol, demand things like &#34;first test&#34; before grug
even write code or have any idea what grug doing domain!</p>
<p>how grug test what grug not even understand domain!?</p>
<p>&#34;Oh, don&#39;t worry: the tests will show you what you need to do.&#34;</p>
<p>grug once again catch grug slowly reaching for club, but grug stay calm</p>
<p>grug instead prefer write most tests after prototype phase, when code has begun firm up</p>
<p>but, note well: grug must here be very disciplined!</p>
<p>easy grug to move on and not write tests because &#34;work on grugs machine&#34;!</p>
<p>this very, very bad: no guarantee work on other machine and no guarantee work on grug machine in future, many times</p>
<p>test shaman have good point on importance of test, even if test shaman often sometimes not complete useful
feature in life and talk only about test all time, deserve of club but heart in right place</p>
<p>also, test shaman often talk unit test very much, but grug not find so useful.  grug experience that ideal tests are not
unit test or either end-to-end test, but in-between test</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit tests</a> fine, ok, but break and make refactor hard as API change and, frankly,
not too useful many bugs anyway often, often throw away when code change.  write unit test mostly at start of project
help get things going but not get too attached</p>
<p><a href="https://smartbear.com/solutions/end-to-end-testing/">end to end</a> tests good, show whole system work, but! hard to
understand when break and drive grug crazy very often, sometimes grugs just end up ignoring because &#34;oh, that break all
time&#34;  very bad!</p>
<p>in-between tests, grug hear shaman call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">&#34;integration tests&#34;</a> sometime
often with sour look on face. but grug say integration test sweet spot according to grug: high level enough test correctness
of system, low level enough, with good debugger, easy to see what break</p>
<p>grug prefer some unit tests especially at start but not 100% all code test and definitely not first test.  many more focus
ferocious integration test as cut point emerge and system stabilize! also small, curated end-to-end test suite that is kept
working religiously on pain of clubbing. focus of important end-to-end test on most common UI features and few most important
edge cases, but not too many or become impossible maintain</p>
<p>this ideal set of test to grug</p>
<p>you may not like, but this peak grug testing</p>
<p>also, grug think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mocking</a> make mockery of testing no prefer only when have
to (rare/never) and coarse grain mocking only at that</p>

<p>grug think agile not terrible, not good</p>
<p>end of day, not worst way to organize development, maybe better than others grug supposes is fine</p>
<p>danger, however, is agile shaman!  many, many shiney rock lost to agile shaman!</p>
<p>whenever project fail, agile shaman say &#34;you didn&#39;t do agile right!&#34;  grug note this awfully convenient for agile
shaman, ask more shiney rock better agile train young grugs on agile, danger!</p>
<p>grug tempted reach for club when too much agile talk happen but always stay calm</p>
<p>prototyping, tools and hiring good grugs better key to success software: agile process ok and help some but sometimes hurt taken
too seriously, never silver club no matter what agile shaman say (danger!)</p>

<p>refactoring fine activity and often good idea, especially later in project when code firmed up</p>
<p>however, grug note that many times in career &#34;refactors&#34; go horribly off rails and end up causing more harm than good</p>
<p>grug not sure exactly why some refactors work well, some fail, but grug notice that larger refactor, more
likely failure appear to be</p>
<p>so grug try to keep refactors relatively small and not be &#34;too far out from shore&#34; during refactor.  ideally system work
entire time and each step of finish before other begin.</p>
<p>end-to-end tests are life saver here, but often very hard understand why broke... such is refactor life.</p>
<p>also grug notice that introducing too much abstraction often lead to refactor failure and system failure.  good example
was <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/j2ee/">J2EE</a> introduce, many big brain sit around thinking too much abstraction, nothing good came of it many project hurt</p>
<p>another good example when company grug work for introduce <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/OSGi">OSGi</a> to help
manage/trap spriit complexity demon in code base.  not only OSGi not help, but make complexity demon much more powerful!
took multiple man year of best developers to rework as well to boot!  more complex spirit and now features impossible
implement! very bad!</p>

<p>wise grug shaman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton">chesterton</a> once say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>here exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>many older grug learn this lesson well not start tearing code out willy nilly, no matter how ugly look</p>
<p>grug understand all programmer platonists at some level wish music of spheres perfection in code.  but danger is here,
world is ugly and gronky many times and code also must so be</p>
<p>humility not often come big brained or think big brained
easily or grug even, but grug often find &#34;oh, grug no like look of this, grug fix&#34; lead many hours pain grug and no better or system
worse even</p>
<p>grug early on in career often charge into code base waving club wildly and smash up everything, learn not good</p>
<p>grug not say no improve system ever, quite foolish, but recommend take time understand system first especially bigger system is and
is respect code working today even if not perfect</p>
<p>here tests often good hint for why fence not to be smashed!</p>

<p>grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too</p>
<p>seem very confusing to grug</p>

<p>grug love tool.  tool and control passion what separate grug from dinosaurs!  tool allow grug brain to create code that
not possible otherwise by doing thinking for grug, always good relief! grug always spend time in new place learning
tools around him to maximize productivity: learn tools for two weeks make development often twice faster and often
have dig around ask other developers help, no docs</p>
<p>code completion in IDE allow grug not have remembered all API very important!</p>
<p>java programming nearly impossible without it for grug!</p>
<p>really make grug think some time</p>
<p>good debugger worth weight in shiney rocks, in fact also more: when faced with bug grug would often trade all shiney rock and
perhaps few children for good debugger and anyway debugger no weigh anything far as grug can tell</p>
<p>grug always recommend new programmer learn available debugger very deeply, features like conditional break points, expression
evaluation, etc</p>
<p>grug say never be not improving tooling</p>

<p>grug very like type systems make programming easier.  for grug, type systems most value when grug hit dot on keyboard and
list of things grug can do pop up magic.  this 90% of value of type system or more to grug</p>
<p>but beware big brains here!</p>
<p>some type big brain think in type systems and talk in lemmas, can be very dangerous!</p>
<p>big brain type system shaman often say type correctness main point type system, but grug note big brain type system
shaman not often ship code.  grug suppose code never shipped is correct, in some sense, but not really what grug mean
when say correct!</p>
<p>also danger abstraction too high, and big brain code become astral projection of platonic generic turing model of
computation into code base.  grug confused and agree some level very elegant but also very hard do anything like
record number of club inventory for Grug Inc. task at hand</p>
<p>generics especially dangerous here, grug try limit generics to container classes for most part where most value add</p>
<p>temptation generics very large is trick!  spirit demon complex love this one trick! beware!</p>
<p>always most value type system come: hit dot see what grug can do, never forget!</p>

<p>grug once like to minimize lines of code much as possible.  write code like this:</p>
<pre><code>  if(contact &amp;&amp; !contact.isActive() &amp;&amp; (contact.inGroup(FAMILY) || contact.inGroup(FRIENDS))) {
    // ...
  }
</code></pre>
<p>over time grug learn this hard debug, learn prefer write like so:</p>
<pre><code>  if(contact) {
    var contactIsInactive = !contact.isActive();
    var contactIsFamilyOrFriends = contact.inGroup(FAMILY) || contact.inGroup(FRIENDS);
    if(contactIsInactive &amp;&amp; contactIsFamilyOrFriends) {
        // ...
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>grug hear screams from young grugs at horror of many line of code and pointless variable and grug prepare defend self with club</p>
<p>club fight start with other developers attack and grug yell: &#34;easier debug!  see result of each expression more clearly and good name!  easier
understand conditional expression!  EASIER DEBUG!&#34;</p>
<p>definitely easier debug and once club fight end calm down and young grug think a bit, they realize grug right</p>
<p>grug still catch grug writing code like first example and often regret, so grug not judge young grug</p>

<p>grug like closures for right job and that job usually abstracting operation over collection of objects</p>
<p>grug warn closures like salt, type systems and generics: small amount go long way, but easy spoil things too much use
give heart attack</p>
<p>javascript developers call very special complexity demon spirit in javascript &#34;callback hell&#34; because too much closure
used by javascript libraries very sad but also javascript developer get what deserved let grug be frank</p>

<p>grug huge fan of logging and encourage lots of it, especially in cloud deployments.  some non-grugs say logging expensive
and not important.  grug used think this way no more</p>
<p>funny story: grug learn idol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">rob pike</a> working on logging at google and decide:
&#34;if rob pike working on logging, what grug do there?!?&#34; so not pursue.  turn out logging <em>very</em> important to google so
of course best programmer work on it, grug!</p>
<p>don&#39;t be such grug brain, grug, much less shiney rock now!</p>
<p>oh well, grug end up at good company anyway and rob pike dress habit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KINIAgRpkDA">increasingly erratic</a>, so all work out in end, but
point stand: logging very important!</p>
<p>grug tips on logging are:</p>
<ul>
<li>log all major logical branches within code (if/for)</li>
<li>if &#34;request&#34; span multiple machine in cloud infrastructure, include request ID in all so logs can be grouped</li>
<li>if possible make log level dynamically controlled, so grug can turn on/off when need debug issue (many!)</li>
<li>if possible make log level per user, so can debug specific user issue</li>
</ul>
<p>last two points are especially handy club when fighting bugs in production systems very often</p>
<p>unfortunately log libraries often very complex (java, <a href="https://stackify.com/logging-java/">why you do?</a>) but worth investing
time in getting logging infrastructure &#34;just right&#34; pay off big later in grug experience</p>
<p>logging need taught more in schools, grug think</p>

<p>grug, like all sane developer, fear concurrency</p>
<p>as much as possible, grug try to rely on simple concurrency models like stateless web request handlers and simple
remote job worker queues where jobs no interdepend and simple api</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control">optimistic concurrency</a> seem work well for web stuff</p>
<p>occasionally grug reach for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage">thread local variable</a>, usually when
writing framework code</p>
<p>some language have good concurrent data structure, like java <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html">ConcurrentHashMap</a>
but still need careful grug work to get right</p>
<p>grug has never used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)">erlang</a>, hear good things, but language
look wierd to grug sorry</p>

<p>grug love good apis.  good apis not make grug think too much</p>
<p>unfortunately, many apis very bad, make grug think quite a bit.  this happen many reasons, here two:</p>
<ul>
<li>API creators think in terms of implementation or domain of API, rather than in terms of use of API</li>
<li>API creators think too abstract and big brained</li>
</ul>
<p>usually grug not care too deeply about detail of api: want write file or sort list or whatever, just want to call
<code>write()</code> or <code>sort()</code> or whatever</p>
<p>but big brain api developers say:</p>
<p>&#34;not so fast, grug!  is that file <em>open for write</em>? did you define a <em>Comparator</em> for that sort?&#34;</p>
<p>grug find self restraining hand reaching for club again</p>
<p>not care about that stuff right now, just want sort and write file mr big brain!</p>
<p>grug recognize that big brain api designer have point and that <em>sometime</em> these things matter, but often do not.
big brain api developers better if design for simple cases with simple api, make complex cases possible
with more complex api</p>
<p>grug call this &#34;layering&#34; apis: two or three different apis at different level complexity for various grug needs</p>
<p>also, if object oriented, put api on thing instead of elsewhere. java worst at this!</p>
<p>grug want filter list:</p>
<p>&#34;Did you convert it to a stream?&#34;</p>
<p>fine, grug convert to stream</p>
<p>&#34;OK, now you can filter.&#34;</p>
<p>OK, but now need return list!  have stream!</p>
<p>&#34;Did you collect it in a list?&#34;</p>
<p>grug hand reaching for club yet again, control</p>
<p>put common thing like <code>filter()</code> on list and make return list big brain java api developer!</p>
<p>nobody care about &#34;stream&#34; or even hear of &#34;stream&#34; before, is not networking api big brain!  all java developer use list!</p>

<p>some non-grugs, when faced with web development say:</p>
<p>&#34;I know, I&#39;ll split my front end and back end codebase up and use <hot new="" spa="" library=""> talking to a GraphQL JSON API back end&#34;</hot></p>
<p>now you have two complexity demon spirit lairs</p>
<p>and, what is worse, front end complexity demon spirit even more powerful and have deep spiritual hold on entire front end
industry as far as grug can tell</p>
<p>back end developers try keep things simple and can work ok, but front end developers make very complex very quickly and
introduce lots of code, demon complex spirit</p>
<p>even when website just need put form into database or simple brochure site!</p>
<p>everyone do this now!</p>
<p>grug not sure why except maybe facebook and google say so, but that not seem very good reason to grug</p>
<p>grug not like big complex front end libraries everyone use</p>
<p>grug make <a href="https://htmx.org">htmx</a> and <a href="https://hyperscript.org">hyperscript</a> to avoid</p>
<p>keep complexity low, simple HTML, avoid lots javascript, the natural ether of spirit complexity demon</p>
<p>maybe they work for you, but no job postings, sorry</p>
<p>react better for job, but also you become alcolyte of complexity demon whether you like or not, sorry is life</p>

<p>grug note lots of fads in development, especially front end development today</p>
<p>back end better more boring because all bad ideas have tried at this point maybe (still retry some!)</p>
<p>still trying all bad ideas in front end development so still much change and hard to know</p>
<p>grug recommend taking all revolutionary new approach with grain salt: big brains have working for long
time on computers now, most ideas have tried at least once.  grug not saying can&#39;t learn new tricks or no good
new ideas, but also much of time wasted on recycled bad ideas, lots of spirit complexity demon power come from putting
new idea willy nilly into code base</p>
<p>note!  very good if senior grug willing to say publicly: &#34;hmmm, this too complex for grug&#34;!</p>
<p>many developers Fear Of Looking Dumb (FOLD), grug also at one time fold, but grug learn get over:  important senior grug say
&#34;this too complicated and confuse&#34;  this make it ok for junior grugs to admit too complex not understand as well!  FOLD
major source of complexity demon power over developer, especially younger grugs!</p>
<p>take FOLD power away, very good senior grug!</p>
<p>note: important to make thinking face and look big brained when saying though.  be prepare for big brain or, worse and
much more common, <em>thinks</em> is big brain to make fun.  be strong! no fold!  club sometimes useful here, but more often sense
of humor and especially last failed project by big brain very useful, so collect</p>

<p>grug note many such impostor feels in development</p>
<p>always grug one of two states: grug is ruler of all survey, wield code club like thor OR grug have no idea what doing</p>
<p>grug is mostly latter state most times, hide it pretty well though</p>
<p>now, grug make softwares of much work and moderate open source success, and yet grug himself often feel not any
idea what doing!  very often!  fear make mistake break everyone code and disappoint other grugs!</p>
<p>is maybe nature of programming for most and be ok with is best, nobody imposter if everybody imposter</p>
<p>any young grug read this far probably do fine in program career even if frustrations and worry is always to be there, sorry</p>
