            <p>I played two shows in NYC in March!</p>
            <p>
              The first one was on March 23 at The Living Gallery in Brooklyn,
              where I performed visuals in an A/V collaboration with
              <a href="https://leetusman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lee Tusman</a>. The show was organized by Proto, a.k.a.
              <a href="https://proto.garden/imaginary_prisons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Imaginary Prisons</a>
              from Worcester, MA (and a friend from the fediverse!) All the sets
              besides ours were by Massachusetts-based experimental/noise folks,
              and they were a lot of fun. (My favorite moment was when Proto
              played the spoons.)

            <p>
              The second show I played was on March 31 at Union Docs in
              Ridgewood, where I performed a solo AV set. The event was part of
              a series called
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/women_innovating_sound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women Innovating Sound Experiences</a>, which highlights women/non-binary artists working in
              experimental sound &amp; media arts, and is curated by fellow
              artist
              <a href="https://www.jenngrossman.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn Grossman</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This installment of the series was themed around
              <em>Audiovisual Alchemy</em>, with performances by
              <a href="http://www.maria-takeuchi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maria Takeuchi</a>
              and
              <a href="http://melissafclarke.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melissa F. Clarke</a>, and a screening by
              <a href="https://strangerays.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rachel Efruss</a>. After the main event, we all sat down together for a Q&amp;A
              with the audience about our processes, and I talked a little about
              my system for live generative visuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              I really enjoyed playing alongside these wonderful artists, and
              the crowd was great, with lots of familiar faces. Big thanks to
              Jenn Grossman, Mike Clemow, and Jacob McCoy for shooting lots of
              photos and videos.

            <p><strong>&#34;How did you make those visuals?&#34;</strong></p>
            <p>
              Since a few people were curious about my current live video
              performance setup, I made a flowchart of the process I used for
              both of these shows. I&#39;ve been noodling around with it for a while
              (since I started using Resolume last year), and I keep finding new
              tricks and smoothing out quirks. I feel like I am able to make the
              most of both my analog and digital tools while also avoiding the
              pitfalls of either. Also, it&#39;s compact enough for me to carry
              everything at once — at least for short distances.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Footage I have pre-recorded includes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Footage I shot while walking around</li>
              <li>Water, ferrofluid and other liquids</li>
              <li>Slit-scan processed imagery</li>
              <li>
                Video feedback created with cameras and analog video mixers
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Digital effects I use on all layers:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Brightness</li>
              <li>Contrast</li>
              <li>Blur (amount &amp; distance)</li>
              <li>Saturation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>I use these effects specifically for the framebuffer
                feedback:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Time delay</li>
              <li>X and Y displacement</li>
              <li>Invert</li>
              <li>
                Sharpen (used in conjuntion with blur to create Turing/reaction
                diffusion patterns)
              </li>
              <li>Hue rotation</li>
            </ul>
