I think I&#39;ve already go an OK understanding, but this will test that assumption.</li><li>Building something that can ask for discreet updates in enough places to be useful. This probably means making a native app of some kind to use the right notifications APIs.</li></ol><p>Of course, part of the challenge here is to keep things as small and simple as possible, so we&#39;ll see how much work is actually necessary!</p><h2>Updates</h2><dl><dt>2024</dt><dd><a href="https://bytes.zone/micro/thing-a-month-03-02/">what&#39;s between two pings?</a>, <em>March 5, 2024</em></dd><dd><a href="https://bytes.zone/micro/thing-a-month-03-01/">messing around with statistics</a>, <em>March 5, 2024</em></dd></dl></article></div></div>
