    <h1>Hello, new subscribers.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I am pleasantly surprised that I gained a number of subscribers over the past week. I just wanted to say hello to thank you for following.</p>

<p>If you are here for essays like <a href="https://plug-world.com/2023/06/14/reddit-moat.html">Reddit is OpenAI’s Moat</a>, I suggest my 2017 essay about autocorrect called <a href="https://plug-world.com/2017/12/12/pink-lexical-slime.html">Pink Lexical Slime</a>. It took a year to research and write. In that essay, I showed how autocorrect was changing English spelling. I extrapolated how predictive text could amplify bias and alter English style. Of course, predictive text turned into large language models, making the issues way bigger. I should write a big update to that essay at some point.</p>

<p>Please beware that by following me, you are exposing yourself to highly technical content about Linux and databases like <a href="https://plug-world.com/2023/04/06/whats-writing-to-my-disk.html">What’s Writing to My Brand-new Disk?</a>.</p>

<p>Again, thanks for following me.</p>

<p>By the way, feel free to say hi at dm@cyberdemon.org!</p>
