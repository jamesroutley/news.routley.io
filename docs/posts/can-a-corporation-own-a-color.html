    <h1>Can a Corporation “Own” a Color?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    


<p>On a summer day in 2019, Daniel Schreiber opened his mailbox to find a threatening letter from one of the world’s largest telecom companies.</p>



<p>In the letter, Deutsche Telekom AG (the parent company of T-Mobile) accused Schreiber’s small insurance startup, Lemonade, of trademark infringement. Schreiber was confused: He hadn’t used T-Mobile’s name. He hadn’t appropriated the company’s logo or tagline. Hell, he wasn’t even in the cell phone business.</p>



<p>But as he read on, he realized his “crime” was using the color <strong>magenta</strong>.</p>



<p>In recent years, companies like T-Mobile have achieved something once thought to be legally impossible: They’ve successfully trademarked individual colors.</p>



<p>When a color becomes synonymous with a brand — think <strong>robin egg blue</strong> jewelry boxes, <strong>brown</strong> delivery trucks, or <strong>orange</strong> scissors — a company can claim a certain form of “ownership” over it.</p>



<p>But how is it possible for a single corporation to call dibs on a color? And what effect does this exclusivity have on its competitors?</p>



<h2><strong>A colorful history</strong></h2>





<p>Under the umbrella of intellectual property law, the 3 most common applications are the trademark, the copyright, and the patent.</p>

<p>While corporations routinely file all of these, they use the trademark to (quite liberally) protect anything integral to their brand. Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/lanham_act">legal doctrine</a>, this might be “any word, name, symbol, or device [used to] identify and distinguish” a company’s good or service from its competitors.</p>



<p>When a trademark is granted, it gives a company the exclusive right to use that intellectual property in its respective industries.<br/></p>

<p><em>Note: Though trademarks are indefinite, they still need to be renewed every 10 years. (Zachary Crockett / The Hustle)</em></p>



<p>For many years, a color did not, by itself, qualify as a trademark.</p>



<p>Though companies had successfully trademarked combinations of colors (e.g., Campbell’s soup labels), the US Patent and Trademark Office shot down attempts to trademark a single color. John Deere, for example, would not be permitted to lay claim to the color <strong>green</strong> in the farm equipment industry.</p>



<p>Scholars maintained several arguments against issuing single color trademarks:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Color depletion theory</strong>: Only around <a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-intelligence/articles/technical/pantone-numbering-explained">1,867</a> solid Pantone colors exist; if brands all claim a color, we’ll eventually run out.</li><li><strong>Shade confusion theory: </strong>It would be hard for the consumer to determine the difference between slight shade variations of colors claimed by brands.</li></ol>



<p>But everything changed when this stuff came along:</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1000" height="477" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/pink2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation in its trademark pink-dyed hue (Pixabay)</em></p>



<p>That, dear readers, is a piece of fiberglass insulation (the stuff that goes behind our walls) from a company called Owens-Corning. </p>



<p>In the late <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/in-the-pink">1950s</a>, Owens-Corning was facing steep competition from other fiberglass insulation companies. At the time, all products were the same “naturally <strong>tan</strong>” hue; to distinguish itself, Owens-Corning decided to infuse their product with dye.</p>



<p>For the next 30 years, the company used its unique <strong>pink</strong> insulation as a marketing tool: It adopted the slogan “think pink,” used the Pink Panther as a mascot, and spent <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&amp;context=jipl">tens of millions of dollars</a> advertising the color.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/517628185/?terms=Owens%2BCorning%2Bcolor%2Btrademark%2Bpink">1985</a>, after a 5-year legal battle, Owens-Corning became the first company in American history to successfully trademark a color.</p>



<p>Ten years later, a second company, Qualitex, went all the way to the <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/514/159.html">Supreme Court</a> to defend its right to trademark its signature <strong>green-gold</strong> dry cleaning pads. The court ruled that color could, indeed, serve to <a href="https://law.freeadvice.com/intellectual_property/trademark_law/secondary_meanings.htm">identify</a> a brand — and in doing so, opened up the floodgates for companies to file their own color trademarks.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-it-take-to-trademark-a-color"><strong>What does it take to trademark a color?</strong></h2>





<p>In the decades since that Supreme Court case, a number of companies have successfully trademarked single colors.</p>



<p>Tiffany &amp; Co. trademarked its famous <strong>blue</strong> in 1998 — the same year UPS trademarked its “<strong>Pullman Brown</strong>.” 3M secured its signature <strong>canary yellow</strong> color for its Post-it notes, Deutsche Telekom AG protected T-Mobile’s famous <strong>magenta</strong>, and Fiskars has one for <strong>orange</strong> scissor handles.</p>



<p>There are even a few you wouldn’t expect: The Wiffle Ball, Inc. has a trademark on <strong>yellow</strong> for use in bats, and the estate of the late musician Prince currently has one <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/889/75/n-88975900.html">pending</a> for the color <strong>purple</strong>.</p>



<p>These trademarks aren’t exclusive to businesses, either. The University of Texas at Austin (<a href="https://www.utexas.edu/brand-guidelines/brand-identity/primary-colors">Pantone 159</a>) and The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (<a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-finder/542-C">Pantone 542</a>) both have protections on their school colors.<br/></p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1000" height="548" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/colors-final.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>A few of these companies, like Cadbury, have since lost their color trademark in legal disputes (Zachary Crockett / The Hustle)</em></p>



<p>Plenty of brands trademark certain colors that might appear in conjunction with a logo (think, for instance, McDonald’s <strong>red</strong> and <strong>yellow</strong>, or Facebook’s <strong>blue</strong>). But these companies have done something different and far rarer: They have trademarked literal swatches of color.</p>



<p>“Usually a company does this when its business model relies, to some extent, on a particular color,” says Jeffrey Samuels, a professor emeritus at The University of Akron School of Law. “It will trademark a color to prevent other companies from using it.”</p>



<p>An important distinction, adds Samuels, is that a company with a color trademark only “owns” the color in connection to particular goods or services.</p>



<p>Take, for instance, the purple trademark from Prince’s estate, Paisley Park Enterprises. The trademarked image is the color purple alone — no words, no logos, no other form of branding. If granted, it will give them a claim to the color <strong>purple</strong> for use in live music venues. Purple alone, they claim, is enough to ID their brand.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1000" height="347" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/prince.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>A trademark filed by Paisley Park Enterprises seeks to secure a shade of purple (Pantone color “Love Symbol #2”) for use in musical performance (Justia)</em></p>



<p>To successfully secure such a trademark, a firm must <a href="https://lizerbramlaw.com/2012/08/30/gold-glove-trademark-battle-color-as-a-trademark/">prove</a> that a single color:</p>



<ul><li>Achieves “<a href="https://law.freeadvice.com/intellectual_property/trademark_law/secondary_meanings.htm">secondary meaning</a>” (distinguishes a product from competitors and identifies the company as the definitive source of the product)</li><li>Doesn’t put competitors at a disadvantage by affecting cost or quality</li><li>Doesn’t serve a functional<strong> </strong>purpose</li></ul>



<p>This last piece, says IP lawyer Robert Zelnick, means that “a color really has to be quite arbitrary” to be trademarked: It can’t be essential to the production of the product or serve any utilitarian purpose.</p>



<p>Sometimes, proving all of his can be extremely challenging.</p>



<p>General Mills, for instance, has <a href="https://qz.com/1062688/cheerios-just-lost-its-bid-to-trademark-the-color-yellow/">twice failed</a> to secure a <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/867/57/n-86757390.html">trademark</a> on <strong>yellow</strong> for its Cheerios box, on the grounds that the color isn’t synonymous with the brand since too many other cereal companies use it in their branding. </p>



<p>Pepto-Bismol’s attempts to <a href="https://lizerbramlaw.com/2012/05/16/hershey-bars-and-functional-trademarks/">trademark</a> <strong>pink</strong> were thwarted when a court deemed that the “therapeutic” effect the color had on customers was “functional.”</p>



<h2 id="h-the-color-wars"><strong>The color wars</strong></h2>



<p>As the CEO of Lemonade learned, companies that <em>are </em>granted color trademarks often go to great lengths to enforce them in court — and competitors often challenge their right to monopolize certain hues.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1000" height="657" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/legere2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>

<p>Over the years, these controversial trademarks have resulted in dozens of lawsuits relating to color “ownership:”</p>



<ul><li>In 2002, <a href="https://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/intellectual-property-law/intellectual-property-keyed-to-merges/trademark-law/mattel-inc-mca-records/">Mattel</a> brought suit against MCA Records for, among other things, allowing the band Aqua to use its trademarked <strong>pink</strong> color on its album cover for the single, “Barbie Girl.” The judge famously advised both parties to “chill.”</li><li>In 2010, <a href="https://newfoodeconomy.org/food-company-color-trademarks-reeses-peanut-butter-chocolate-orange/">Hershey</a> sued Mars for using <strong>orange</strong> on the packaging of a peanut butter candy bar. The suit was later dropped.</li><li>In 2011, <a href="https://fashionista.com/2012/12/the-christian-louboutin-vs-ysl-red-sole-battle-is-officially-over-for-good-this-time">Louboutin</a> accused Yves Saint Laurent of infringing on its trademark <strong>red</strong> shoe soles and won.</li><li>In 2015, toolmaker <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/law360/b/newsheadlines/posts/black-amp-decker-wins-54m-in-dewalt-trade-dress-battle">DeWalt</a> won a $54m judgment against a competitor that copied its <strong>black</strong> and <strong>yellow</strong> colors, though it was later tossed out on appeal.</li></ul>



<p>But one company has been <em>particularly </em>protective of its color trademark.</p>



<p>T-Mobile’s parent company, Deutsche Telekom AG, has spent at least 12 years attempting to prevent competitors — some large, some small — from using <strong>magenta</strong>.</p>



<p>Though its trademark covers only a specific variation of the color (<a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-finder/Rhodamine-Red-U">Pantone Rhodamine Red U</a>), the company has expanded its definition of magenta to encompass a variety of surrounding hues. Since Deutsche Telekom has its hands in so many projects, it has also been able to defend its trademark in industries outside of telecommunications, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90436680/t-mobile-is-suing-a-company-for-using-magenta-can-it-really-own-a-color">ranging</a> from fashion to healthcare.</p>



<p>In 2008, it went after the rival European wireless carrier <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008/05/28/t-mobile-loses-magenta-suit-against-telia-we-try-not-to-laugh/">Telia</a>. A few months later, it demanded that the tech blog <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gallery/deutsche-telekom-t-mobile-demands-engadget-mobile-discontinue-using-the-color-magenta/">Engadget</a> drop magenta from its mobile logo. In 2014, a judge <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/02/10/court-says-t-mobile-owns-the-color-magenta/">ruled</a> that AT&amp;T subsidiary Aio Wireless couldn’t use <strong>magenta</strong> because it would confuse T-Mobile customers.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1000" height="653" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/engadget.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>A letter sent by T-Mobile’s parent company to Engadget, demanding that the blog stop using the color magenta in its logo (Engadget)</em></p>



<p>Its latest victim, Lemonade, has complied with T-Mobile’s demand by changing the color of its marketing materials in Germany, where Deutsche Telekom AG is based. The company has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/lemonade-gets-a-nastygram-from-deutsche-telekom-over-its-use-of-magenta-says-it-will-fight/">filed</a> a motion in Europe to “invalidate Deutsche Telekom’s <strong>magenta</strong> trademark.” </p>



<p>Making changes like this can be costly — especially for bigger firms that spend tens of millions of dollars on marketing and branding strategies.</p>



<p>But legal fees can also rack up for the companies that constantly trawl for color trademark violations, begging a question:</p>



<h2><strong>Is trademarking a color worth all the effort?</strong></h2>

 



<p>When a company files a trademark in black and white — say a simple logo — the trademark is actually protected in <em>all </em>color variations by default. Nobody can, say, take the McDonald’s <strong>red</strong> and <strong>yellow</strong> logo, make it <strong>purple</strong> and <strong>green</strong>, and claim it as his own.</p>



<p>So, why would a brand go through all the trouble of trademarking a color when they likely already have so many other protections?</p>



<p>“You only see brands do this when the color is critical to the brand, or sales, or the way the product is marketed,” says Zelnick, the IP lawyer.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1000" height="498" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/popular-colors.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Across all trademarks (including logos), blue is the color of choice (Zachary Crockett / The Hustle)</em></p>



<p>Most marketers are aware of the effect color has on consumer behavior. Surveys and studies have shown that:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f7c3/b2a780a7a3bf907ef807085b86a63f0d8d0a.pdf">62%-90%</a> of a consumer’s initial judgment of a product is based on color.</li><li><a href="http://ejshs.net/journals_n/1410980912.pdf">52%</a> of consumers say the color of packaging is an indicator of quality.</li><li>Color increases brand recognition by up to <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f7c3/b2a780a7a3bf907ef807085b86a63f0d8d0a.pdf">80%</a>.</li></ul>



<p>So, if you’re thinking about making your entire brand one solid color, go ahead and try your luck. Just don’t pick <strong>magenta</strong>.</p>
