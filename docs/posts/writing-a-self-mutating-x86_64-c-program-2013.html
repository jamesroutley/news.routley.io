  <p><code>garner-vale</code> is a collection of stylistic suggestions and corrections for English prose, written as a plugin for the command-line tool <a href="https://vale.sh/docs">Vale</a>. I spent more than 20 hours reading all 983 pages of the fourth edition of <em>Garner&#39;s Modern English Usage</em> (by Bryan A. Garner) and hand-coding as many entries as practicable.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p><code>garner-vale</code> is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive plugin ever written for Vale. It has over 200 distinct rules covering more than 3,000 words and phrases, among them more than 100 tricky plural forms, almost 1,900 corrections for misspellings and malapropisms, more than 500 &#39;needless variant&#39; terms, and dozens of commonly-confused pairs of words. It recognizes all inflected forms of verbs and nouns (<em>obtain</em>, <em>obtains</em>, <em>obtaining</em>, <em>obtained</em>) and produces suggestions that respect the original form (<em>obtain</em> → <em>get</em>, <em>obtains</em> → <em>gets</em>, <em>obtaining</em> → <em>getting</em>, <em>obtained</em> → <em>got</em>).</p>
<p>You can find instructions for installation at <a href="https://github.com/iafisher/garner-vale">https://github.com/iafisher/garner-vale</a>. Comments, suggestions, and corrections are welcome at <a href="https://github.com/iafisher/garner-vale/issues">https://github.com/iafisher/garner-vale/issues</a> or by email.</p>
<p><em>A note on Garner:</em> Samuel Johnson wrote that &#34;to make dictionaries is dull work,&#34; and I can testify that to read them is hardly more edifying. But even after trawling<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> through every entry from &#34;a&#34; to &#34;zwieback&#34;,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> I cannot praise <em>Garner&#39;s Modern English Usage</em> enough. It is a masterly<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> achievement of lexicography that sparkles with erudition and wit, and anyone who is serious about writing in English should get their hands on a copy. ∎</p>
