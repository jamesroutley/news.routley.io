    <h1>Setelinleikkaus: When Finns snipped their cash in half to curb inflation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-7830074591186405092" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>On the last day of 1945, with World War II finally behind it, Finland&#39;s government announced a new and very strange policy.</p><p>All Finns were required to take out a pair of scissors and snip their banknotes in half. This was known in Finland as <i>setelinleikkaus</i>, or banknote cutting. Anyone who owned any of the three largest denomination Finnish banknotes <span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> the 5000 markka note, the 1000, or the 500 <span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> was required to perform this operation immediately. The left side of the note could still be used to buy things, but at only half its value. So if a Finn had a 1000 markka note in their wallet, henceforth he or she could now only buy 500 markka worth of items at stores. As for the right side, it could no longer be spent and effectively became a bond (more on this later).</p><p>It was plain to governments all across Europe what this sudden making-up of postponed consumption in a war-focused economy would lead to: a big one time jump in prices.</p><p>This may sound familiar to the modern day reader, since we just went through our own wartime economy of sorts: the 2020-21 battle against COVID and subsequent return to a peacetime economy. The supply chain problem caused by the COVID shutdowns combined with the big jump in spending as lockdowns expired, spurred on by a big overhang of unspent COVID support cheques, led to the steepest inflation in decades. </p><p>According to Dornbusch and Wolf, European authorities fretted that the post-WWII jump in prices could very well spiral into something worse: all-out hyperinflation, as had happened after the first World War. Currencies were no longer linked to gold, after all, having lost that tether when the war started<span lang="en"><span>, </span></span>or earlier, in response to the Great Depression. </p><p>To prevent what they saw as imminent hyperinflation, almost all European countries began to enact monetary reforms. Finland&#39;s own unique reform <span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> obliging their citizens to cut their stash of banknotes in two <span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> would reduce the economy&#39;s stock of banknotes to just &#34;lefts,&#34; thereby halving spending power and muting the wave of post-wartime spending. After February 16, 1946 the halves would be demonetized, but until then the Finns could continue to make purchases with them or bring them to the nearest bank to be converted into a new edition of the currency.</p><p>As for the right halves, they were to be transformed into a long-term investment. Finns were obligated to bring each right half in to be registered, upon which it would be converted into a Finnish government bond that paid 2% interest per year, to be repaid four years later, in 1949. It was illegal to try and spend right halves or transfer their ownership to anyone else (although it&#39;s not apparent how this was enforced).</p><p>In theory, turning right halves into bonds would shift a large part of the Finnish public&#39;s post-war consumption intentions forward to 1949, when the bonds could finally be cashed. By then, the economy would have fully transitioned back to a civilian one and would be capable of accepting everyone&#39;s desired consumption spending without hyperinflation occurring.</p><p>To our modern sensibilities, this is a wildly invasive policy. Had <i>setelinleikkaus</i> been proposed in 2022-23 as a way to dampen the inflationary effects of the reopening of COVID-wracked economies, and we all had to cut our dollar bills or yen or euros in half, there probably would have been a revolt. </p><p>Why the failure? As Finish economist Matti Viren has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081609/http://www.rahamuseo.fi/monetaria/studia_monetaria_viren_kev%C3%A4t_2007.pdf">pointed out</a>, the reform only affected banknotes, not bank deposits. This stock of notes only comprised 8% of the total Finnish money supply, (Finns being  uncommonly comfortable with banks) so a major chunk of the monetary overhang was left in place.</p><p>Another glitch appears to have been the public&#39;s anticipation of <i>setelinleikkaus</i>.

Taking place over four days in October 1944, Belgium contracted its entire money supply, both banknotes and deposits, from 165 billion to 57.5 billion francs. That&#39;s a two-thirds decline!
