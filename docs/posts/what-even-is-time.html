    <h1>What Even Is Time?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
<p>September 24, 2025</p>

<p>It’s been a while since I blogged, so long that the old version of
<a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">middleman</a> I was using could not run in any version
of Ruby that <a href="https://mise.jdx.dev/">mise</a> could install on my machine and
moving off middleman seemed less work than dealing with that.</p>

<p>I don’t even remember moving to middleman from
<a href="https://octopress.org/">octopress</a> but now I am back on
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>In what is probably quite an on-brand move I have decided to use the <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte
CSS</a> theme that was cool 10 years ago.
<label for="use-of-sidenotes"></label><span>Which is odd as Im not <em>that</em> into sidenotes
really</span></p>

<p>A fair bit has happened that I will write more about soon but as a quick summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moved to Malta during covid</li>
  <li>Got Married</li>
  <li>Learned to sail</li>
  <li>Had a kid (Izzy, nearly 3 now)</li>
  <li>Moved back to the UK</li>
  <li>Did a batch at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">the Recurse Center</a> <label for="rc"></label><span>Probably the main reason I wanted to reboot my blog was being inspired by the RC alum feed</span></li>
</ul>

<p>I also just bought a house near where I am from on <a href="https://www.visitwirral.com/">The
Wirral</a> in the northwest of the UK and we went for
some <del>Digital Nomad</del> Analogue Hobo Family time in Porto and then Syros with
<a href="https://www.boundless.life/syros-greece">Boundless Life</a> while the paperwork
went through.</p>

<p>I am currently in my wife’s home town of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ia%C8%99i">Iași</a> in the east of Romania for a few
more weeks and then return to the UK mid October.</p>

<p>TTFN <label for="ttfn"></label><span>ta ta for now (ie <em>goodbye</em>), which I know from Tigger in the 1968 Disney Winnie the Pooh but apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TTFN">started in WW2</a></span></p>
