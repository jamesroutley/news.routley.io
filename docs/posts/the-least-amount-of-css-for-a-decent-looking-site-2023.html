    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> People often over-engineer solutions, and it leads to them running into problems with their CSS. In this article, we&#39;ll take a look at the least amount of CSS that you need to make a decent looking page.</p>

  <p>The fun part of making a website is that if you write your HTML and nothing else, you have a responsive website.</p>
<p>Granted, if you have images they can cause some overflow issues.</p>
<p>So we can start things off by fixing that:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>img</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>max-width</span><span>:</span> 100%<span>;</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> block<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It’s possible you have videos or SVGs that are also causing problems (less likely with SVGs though), so if you need, you can expand upon this a little bit.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>img,
svg,
video</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>max-width</span><span>:</span> 100%<span>;</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> block<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="improving-the-typography">Improving the typography</h2>
<p>The first thing we can do is change the font family since the default is never very exciting.</p>
<p>We’ll just use a basic <code>system-ui</code> for this example. It has pretty good support these days, and looks good on every system without having to worry about loading in any extra fonts.</p>
<p>In general, the font-size is a little small as well, so we can bump it up, and the default line-height is always a bit tight, so anything within the 1.5 to 1.7 range should do:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>body</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>font-family</span><span>:</span> System UI<span>;</span>
  <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> 1.25rem<span>;</span>
  <span>line-height</span><span>:</span> 1.5<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Though not perfect, this is already a huge improvement over the regular defaults.</p>
<h2 id="adding-dark-mode-support">Adding Dark Mode Support</h2>
<p>Many people love dark mode, so let’s enable it based on a user’s system preferences.</p>
<p>We can do this by using the <code>color-scheme</code> property:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>html</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>color-scheme</span><span>:</span> light dark<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This will set the user-agent-styles to either a light or dark theme, based on the users system preferences.</p>
<p>If you’d prefer, we can do this without CSS as well!</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span><span><span>&lt;</span>html</span> <span>lang</span><span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span>en<span>&#34;</span></span> <span>color-scheme</span><span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span>light dark<span>&#34;</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<h3 id="a-small-note-on-following-the-system-preferences">A small note on following the system preferences</h3>
<p>While this is really handy, it is a best practice to allow users to manually toggle the color-scheme as well.</p>
<p>Some people prefer a dark system theme, but light website themes, and vice-versa.</p>
<h2 id="restraining-content-width">Restraining Content Width</h2>
<p>Line-length is one of the most important things when it comes to the readability of text.</p>
<p>We generally <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/line-length.html">want to try and fall somewhere in the 45-90 characters per line range</a> (for body text, not headlines).</p>
<p>To make the website more readable, we’ll limit the content width using a <code>main</code> element and some CSS magic:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>main</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>max-width</span><span>:</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span>70ch<span>,</span> 100% - 4rem<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>margin-inline</span><span>:</span> auto<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>min()</code> function here will pick whatever is smallest, either <code>70ch</code> or <code>100% - 4rem</code>. Because we are inside a <code>min()</code> function, we don’t need to use a <code>calc()</code>.</p>
<p>Whatever the output from that min() function, the width is less than 100%, so the page will be stuck to the left side of the viewport.</p>
<p>We can then use margin-inline: auto to center it, as this acts on the margins on the inline axis, so in any horizontal writing modes, that means both the margin-left and margin-right are auto.</p>
<p>You might want to switch out the main selector for a .container or .wrapper so you can have more control over where you use it.</p>
<p>And with that, our final CSS file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>html</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>color-scheme</span><span>:</span> light dark<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>body</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>font-family</span><span>:</span> system-ui<span>;</span>
  <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> 1.25rem<span>;</span>
  <span>line-height</span><span>:</span> 1.5<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>img,
svg,
video</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>max-width</span><span>:</span> 100%<span>;</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> block<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>main</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>max-width</span><span>:</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span>70ch<span>,</span> 100% - 4rem<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>margin-inline</span><span>:</span> auto<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="build-on-top-of-this">Build on top of this</h2>
<p>This is just a quick start to get things off the ground, though it could be used for a very simple page as well.</p>
<p>For the most part, though, you’ll probably want to build on top of this, but it should be able to act as a nice jumping off point!</p>
