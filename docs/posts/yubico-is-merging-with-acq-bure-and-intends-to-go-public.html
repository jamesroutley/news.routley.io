    <h1>Yubico is merging with ACQ Bure and intends to go public</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>




<p>We have chosen this path to continue our success to further achieve Yubico’s long-term growth and goals. This is in partnership with our existing trusted investors and board, who support and are strategically aligned with this merger. </p>



<p>The Transaction is expected to be completed during the third quarter 2023, subject to, among other things, approval by the general meeting in ACQ and Yubico, respectively.</p>



<p>I am honored and thrilled by the opportunity to lead Yubico as the company prepares to go public. We see continuous revenue growth, we are profitable, and the need for our technology and our position in the cyber security market has never been stronger. I am looking forward to continuing my work with Yubico’s founders and the rest of our team, who all are instrumental in our company’s success. In addition, ACQ’s strong and long-term shareholder base provides a solid foundation to continue our growth journey in a listed environment.</p>



<p>Here’s what others that are close to the merger are saying: </p>



<p><strong>Stina Ehrensvärd, Co-founder and Chief Evangelist of Yubico commented: </strong>“<em>When Jakob and I founded Yubico in Stockholm 16 years ago, our vision was to make secure logins easy and accessible to everyone. Today, we are proud and humbled to have built and established a global gold standard for strong authentication. Today, our technology protects access for the world’s largest enterprises, critical government infrastructures, human rights organizations, and millions of individuals around the world.</em></p>



<p><em>I am excited that Mattias Danielsson recently transitioned to Yubico’s CEO. He has been my trusted co-worker and top adviser for thirteen years and he and the rest of the team are well positioned to lead the company through this next phase. I am continuing to support Yubico’s development as a member of the board and am working to increase awareness on cyber security in my recent role as Chief Evangelist.” </em></p>



<p><strong>Henrik Blomquist, CEO of ACQ Bure commented: </strong><em>“I am pleased to announce this proposed transaction, which meets all investment criteria communicated when we listed ACQ in 2021. Yubico is a trusted global brand in cybersecurity with a unique blue-chip customer base and is led by a strong management team with a proven track record of profitable growth. By listing Yubico through ACQ, we create a solid foundation for the company to continue its successful growth journey and create value for all our shareholders.”</em></p>



<p><strong>Caroline af Ugglas, on behalf of ACQ board of directors commented: </strong>“<em>The non-conflicted board members of ACQ have carefully considered the potential transaction with Yubico that we have been presented with. We have ensured that a due diligence of Yubico’s operations has been conducted by professional external advisors, and we have obtained a fairness opinion from Handelsbanken that supports that the merger consideration is fair from a financial perspective for ACQ and its shareholders. In conclusion, we all consider Yubico to be an attractive investment for ACQ and therefore for its shareholders, and we recommend that ACQ’s shareholders vote in favor of the transaction at the upcoming EGM.</em>”</p>
