  <h2>moving on</h2>
  
  <p>I want to move on from the current iteration of the <i>finartcialist</i> project.</p>
  
  <p>I am not sure how to make this happen.</p>
  
  <p>There is this tension inside the project about it being my hobby thing versus making it a thing that others can (hopefully) learn from...</p>
  
  <p>I learned many things since the beginning of this project a tiny six years ago. I am not sure how it translate into the project as it currently is.</p>
  
  <p>I attended a programming retreat, found a new job, finished studying before starting it again and dropping out because of the pandemic we are still living through.</p>
  
  <p>And that is only to name a few personal and less personal things.</p>
  
  <p>But how does it work? Do I put all of my current ideas for projects in a box and call it a day for now, for these? I feel that all these projects still have so much to teach me...</p>
  
  <p>And moreso, what would be, could be the next step?</p>
  
  <h2>moving forward</h2>
  
  <p>moving forward is not obvious.</p>
  
  <p>I am not sure what progress would look like. What do I want from this project now? What will I want from it in 2, 3... 5, 10 years from now?</p>
  
  <p>Maybe I am not ready to try and implement some of the ideas I currently have - maybe I can keep them for later, when I have more experience and...</p>
  
  <p>And maybe I won&#39;t want to do them anymore. Might I discard these ideas?</p>
  
  <h2>moving sideways</h2>
  
  <p>I am tired of exploring financial markets at the moment.</p>
  
  <p>I would like to spend more time thinking about the human aspects of exchange: what it means, as a human, to exchange things and services through time and places?</p>
  
  <p>Maybe now is the time to start this new project. Let&#39;s call it <i>v3</i> for now.</p>
