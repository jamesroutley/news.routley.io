    <h1>Ask HN: Why new browsers use Chromium instead of Firefox as their base?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Every time there is a post here related to Firefox, I see a lot of people complaining about the state of browsers and the utterly dominance of Chrome and Chromium based browsers.<p>I’m wondering if that are technical reasons why the newish browsers (such as Brave or Edge) are choosing Chromium instead of Firefox as their starting point.</p><p>If so, shouldn’t this be a priority for Mozilla to change that?</p></td></div></div>
