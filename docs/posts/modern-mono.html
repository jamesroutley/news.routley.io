    <h1>Modern Mono</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">I’ve just finished setting up a new Mac (14&#34; MBP, M2 Pro, 32G, 4T). It dawned on me that most of my really intense
    interactions with this thing involve looking at “monospace” (i.e. fixed-width) text; in Emacs where I write this blog, in
    my IDE, and in my terminal.  The ones that came with the machine by default are, well, OK, but maybe we can do better.  So I got
    on Mastodon and 
    <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@timbray/109837766746088431">asked</a>: “Dear LazyWeb: Setting up a new Mac, what are some
    groovy new monospace fonts for terminals and IDEs?”</p>

<p>Which was like throwing raw meat into the piranha
    pool. Obviously this is something that geeks care about deeply. I got a huge number of suggestions, of which I downloaded 16, basically
    all the ones that are free. In general I prefer to pay for things and am suspicious of anything that’s free on the Net, but
    when there are so many good free options I just don’t think there’s a business model.</p>

<p>Disclosure: In recent years I’ve been using
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inconsolata">Inconsolata</a>, which has always pleased my eye, and also is the only font
    whose inventor I’ve met; I admire
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raph_Levien">Raph Levien</a> extremely. Can I replace it?</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>Method</span> · 
I loaded up the man page for ls(1) in the MacOS Terminal program, with size set to 18pt. By doing so I’m bypassing one
    important criterion: Readability at small size. I suspect that an increasing proportion of geeks, like me, in this era of
    27-inch-and-up 4K screens, don’t really squish the letters the way we did when we were twentysomethings on screens with only a
    million dots. But if you still do, this piece probably won’t help you that much.</p>

<p>So let’s run through those screenshots. I’ll switch Emacs into each font as I write about it. I’ll pick the ones that I think
    are generally the most pleasing and do another screenshot of a moderately complex chunk of Go code as presented by JetBrains’
    excellent <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/go/">GoLand</a> IDE.</p>

<p>Here they are, in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>I lived in this typeface when I was in the Android group 2010-12. It’s perfectly OK but just uses too much horizontal space

<p>“Programmers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several characters. For the human brain, sequences
    like -&gt;, &lt;= or := are single logical tokens, even if they take two or three characters on the screen…”</p>
<p>This is an open-source thing by
    <a href="https://github.com/tonsky">Nikita Prokopov</a>, said to be optimized for code. Its big selling point is a set of
    ligatures, like “≠” for “!=”. Meh; all these years in, my eyes don’t care.</p>

<p>For a font that doesn’t market its typographic values much, it sure pleases my eye; light, clear, well balanced horizontally
    and vertically.</p>

<p>It comes with an ordinary selection of styles: Normal, Light, and so on. But then there’s also “Retina”. It’s difficult to
    find an explanation; one assumes some sort of optimization for high pixel density? Anyhow, it makes me happy; just the tiniest
    bit of extra weight that to my eye makes each character speak its nature a little louder.</p>

<p>The Retina style advances.</p>

<p>By Bigelow &amp; Holmes.</p>
<p>Wow, so many serifs. That strikes me as inconsistent with Go’s design aesthetic, which eschews decoration and fancy features.
    Also, it is notably more vertically compact than the average, which makes my Emacs editing screen look cramped; in code,
    which typically has shorter lines, that’s probably not so much of an issue?</p>

<p>Advance to the next round? Honestly, probably not. But I’m going to advance it anyhow because after all, stage 2 involves Go
    code, which this is said to excel at.</p>

<p>“Designed for the screen. Open source. Libre.”</p>
<p>A little tighter vertically and looser horizontally. Which is arguably a good choice for code, with its shorter lines.
    Looks nice in my editor buffer too. Advances.</p>

<p>“I was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot&#39;s Consolas, which is his monospaced design
    for Microsoft’s upcoming Vista release. This font, similar to his earlier TheSansMono, demonstrated clearly to me that
    monospaced fonts do not have to suck.”<span> —</span>Raph Levien</p>
<p>Unfortunately I am failing to find the words to explain why this pleases my eyes so much; a screenful of it makes me happy.
    It suffers from several sins for which I fault other faces, but even so.
    More compact than this overview’s average but so graceful that I’ll take that and welcome the information density. Advances.</p>

<p>The Light variant also pleases my eyes<span> —</span> even more, a bit. But I don’t think it can quite carry
    the load of all-day every-day work.</p>

<p>“A monospace programming typeface, built declaratively using custom typeface generation software, and
    with an emphasis on compatibility with CJK characters.”</p>
<p>It probably needs to be evaluated in a CJK-heavy application. It definitely, to my eye, has the look of technical printing
    I saw in Japan way back in the day.  But for those of us whose coding lives are mostly in Latin characters, no.</p>

<p>“A typeface for developers.”</p>
<p>And JetBrains knows a lot about developers. This font is so overwhelmingly clear that I can hardly even see it. I can’t think
    of anything to say, which means it’s doing what it’s designed to do. Advances.</p>

<p>When I switch between this and JetBrains, the occupied space shrinks a little, but wow, other than that it looks really about
    the same. Density is good. Which do I prefer? Hmmmm… but it advances.</p>

<p>Derived from San Francisco, per Apple:</p>
<p>Yes, but not derived that well, I think. The lower-case letters are working too hard, mannered even; consider the “r”.
    I’m normally happy to take whatever Apple says is best for my
    general-purpose daily driver, but this one doesn’t meet my bar for a developer’s font.</p>

<p>“Designed by Paul D. Hunt and Teo Tuominen.”</p>
<p>This is from Adobe, obviously a heavyweight in the world of design and typography; was authored in-house.
    Interestingly,
    when I switch back and forth between this and SF Pro, the shape of the text doesn’t change; the character metrics are
    identical. The glyphs do change in interesting ways. Source Code is simpler, less mannered, but neither does it really please my
    eyes nor get out of the way.</p>

In no particular order:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I cheated and included Inconsolata Light.</p>
</li>
<li><p>They all kind of look like each other. Which I guess shouldn’t be surprising.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In fact, they’re all pretty great.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are several opportunities for a “≠” ligature in the code fragment. I don’t think it makes a damn bit of
      difference.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you care about how many lines of code you can see, Hack squeezes the most into your window, JetBrains Mono the
      least. Um, I care.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can tell which is which by click-to-enlarge and look at the labels, or the filenames.</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>Conclusions?</span> · 
I don’t think Go Mono really belongs in the top tier, even though it was designed for the language in the sample.</p>

<p>Nor does Inconsolata Light, actually, although I think it looks great.</p>

<p>I could be super-happy with any of Fira Code Retina, Hack, JetBrains Mono, or Inconsolata. Happy enough, I suspect, that the
    choice doesn’t matter.</p>

But Inconsolata still wins, by a substantial margin.</p><p>At my third-last employer, a decade back, my boss looked over my shoulder and saw my typeface, and instantly forgot all else and switched to it. That is what makes for a winning typeface.</p><p>Adobe&#39;s Source Code Pro is, aside from certain precious letterforms, just Inconsolata with one scan-line chopped out, and then labeled as one point-size off. I call it &#34;Inconsolata Squat&#34;. (I e., SCP-10 derives from IC-11.)</p><p>The best way to compare coding typefaces is to get a bunch of terminal windows full of code, and set your system &#34;mono&#34; face to one, and the terminal settings face to the other, and then click the &#34;use system font&#34; box in the settings pane on and off.</p>

However, I did switch to iA Writer Mono some time ago, which was based on Nitti, a beautiful typewriter face from the original iA Writer for iPad (<a href="https://ia.net/topics/a-typographic-christmas, https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Mono">https://ia.net/topics/a-typographic-christmas, https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Mono</a>). It’s the first programming font I’ve ever found where I actually like the italic version, and that’s why I’ve stuck with it for the last few years.</p>

It&#39;s very evenly balanced (to my eye, at least) in terms of the relative weight of the individual characters, not serif-y at all, and doesn&#39;t suffer from the dreadful &#34;handcuffs&#34; typewriter lower-case g, although if you like Inconsolata...</p>
