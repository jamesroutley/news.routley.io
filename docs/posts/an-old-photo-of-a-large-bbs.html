    <h1>An old photo of a large BBS</h1>

<p>
Nearly 30 years ago, I was given this picture.  I wanted to present it 
in a post all by itself to give it a chance to &#34;sink in&#34; before I went 
and used it in an analogy.  First, I&#39;ll just show the image and explain 
what you&#39;re looking at here.

</p><p>
This was given to me as a postcard-sized photo.  I scanned it in a long 
time ago and then either lost the original or (more likely) threw it 
out.  So, unfortunately, this is the highest resolution I have.
</p><p>
I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games (&#34;doors&#34;) and anything else they cared to offer.
</p><p>
You should be noticing the sheer amount of hardware here.  I count 16 
machines in each group: 8 high, 2 wide.  Then, I see at least 4 groups, 
so this is <em>64 machines</em> in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80286">286s</a> (ATs, more or 
less), but it&#39;s impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but honestly, the workload 
just didn&#39;t call for it.  But, I&#39;m getting ahead of myself!  (More on 
that later...)
</p><p>
I&#39;m fairly sure all of those machines were running DOS.  It might&#39;ve 
been MS-DOS itself, or it could have been IBM&#39;s PC-DOS, or even 
something weirder like DR-DOS or whatever, but I&#39;m fairly sure these 
machines weren&#39;t doing any sort of &#34;real&#34; Unix-style multitasking.  It&#39;s 
likely that one box in this picture equals one &#34;node&#34;, which serviced 
exactly one phone line at a time, and thus one user at a time.
</p><p>
Then they probably ran something like Netware, and so there&#39;s at least 
one more machine somewhere out of the picture that was acting as the 
file server.  These individual nodes might&#39;ve had their own hard drives, 
or they might have been set to boot from a ROM (!) and did everything 
over the network.  There&#39;s no way to know from the photo alone.
</p><p>
Based on the research I&#39;ve done, it seems they got as high as <em>134 
nodes</em>, and that means this picture is only showing HALF of their 
final setup.  Think about that.  That is a lot of machines sitting 
there!
</p><p>
One side note: I noticed what appears to be two modems on top of some 
of these things, like the ones at far right, nearest the camera.  It&#39;s 
possible they managed to do some rudimentary multitasking with DESQview 
(or worse...) and so supported <em>two whole users</em> with each box.  
Does that mean they had to be at least 386s to do protected mode?  Or 
was it virtual 8086 mode?  I (fortunately) have forgotten the finer 
points of how that stuff used to work.  I DO remember how damn crashy a 
box became when you ran it &#34;under DV&#34;.  Constant system freezes.  Yep.
</p><p>
Imagine how much power those things used.  Every watt of heat they 
dumped into the room then had to be pumped out, so that means a 
corresponding amount of air conditioning to take it outside.  That seems 
like a whole mess of juice to me.
</p><p>
So then, when you see this picture (and remember, it might only be
showing half of the whole setup), do you think &#34;wow, cool, they got
to wrangle all of that&#34;, or do you think &#34;OMG they *had* to wrangle all 
of that&#34;?  It&#39;s an important distinction to make, and I think someone&#39;s 
gut reaction to this amount of hardware in one place might influence how 
they approach building new systems.
</p><p>
I&#39;ll leave it there for the moment, but I&#39;ll be back on this topic in 
a subsequent post to get a little more opinionated.
