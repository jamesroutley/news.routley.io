    <h1>How to stop a robot vacuum from getting stuck on the laundry rack</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
        <p>My robotic vacuum loves to ram itself onto and get stuck on my laundry drying rack. It has been doing it for years, and I’ve not had a good solution to the problem. Until now.</p>
        <p>I’ve kept the Roomba out by putting boxes and other obstacles underneath the laundry rack. The robot is surprisingly strong and often manages to push them out of the way.</p>
        <p>I’ve also attempted disastrous solutions involving lots of duck tape wrapped along the length of the bottom tubing. I essentially tried to form an admittedly soft physical barrier with the tape. It looked hideous and didn’t even work all that well.</p>
        
        <p>Last week, I stumbled upon a much better solution. While looking for something completely unrelated, I found the 3D-printing recipe for a freely licensed <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/151700-laundry-rack-raiser-for-vacuum-robot-minimal-16mm-" rel="external">laundry rack raiser</a>. It’s just a set of feet you can camp on to the bottom tubing on a laundry rack.</p>
        <p>It’s an ingenious solution. The laundry rack just needs to be lifted up from the floor enough for the bottom tubing to form a barrier tall enough to trigger the robot’s collision sensor.</p>
        <p>I don’t own a 3D printer and the first available slot at the community 3D printer was in eight weeks. However, I didn’t need this precise plastic gadget to solve my problem.</p>
        <p>I explored different other options for feet and adhesives. The best and simplest solution that got the job done turned out to be twine. I just spun a twine ball around the existing tiny plastic feet to pad the height about 20 mm. This raises it enough to trigger the collision sensor.</p>
        <p><em>Success!</em> The solution is completely obvious in hindsight but yet it managed to avoid me for the 13 years I’ve owned a robotic vacuum cleaner.</p>
