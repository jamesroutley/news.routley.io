<p><a href="https://atari.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atari</a> has just announced a line of officially licensed and authentic reproduction circuit boards from some of their most beloved arcade classics.</p>
<p>These make for a perfect limited edition collector’s item for hardcore arcade fans.</p>
<p>And also are a 1:1 recreation of the original boards. So they would also work as an actual replacement for a damaged board from an original cabinet.</p>
<p>So whether you plan on hanging them on the wall in a frame or bringing a classic arcade cabinet back to life, Atari has you covered.</p>

<h2>Atari Arcade Reproduction Boards</h2>

<p>The new Atari reproduction boards were created in collaboration with <strong>Retro Arcade</strong>, who specialize in… well… retro arcade printed circuit boards. Makes sense, right?</p>
<p>These unique PCBs are primarily intended as a collector’s item, with Atari describing them as “<em>stunning wall pieces</em>”. </p>
<p>The screenprinted graphics on each board features the logo of the game and a historical breakdown, if you can manage to read it.</p>
<p>But they also “<em>follow the original schematics, and can be used to replace damaged original boards by using the original parts from these boards</em>”.</p>
<p>So if you are able to do the technical work, you can transfer the components from an original damaged board to these new unpopulated ones and it should work like a charm.</p>

<p>There are currently five reproduction titles available from the Atari line: <em>Lunar Lande</em>r, <em>Warlords</em> (Rev D), <em>Black Widow</em> (Rev A), <em>Gravitar</em> (Rev C), and <em>Major Havoc</em> (Rev D).</p>
<p>All of these titles also appeared in the <a href="https://retrododo.com/atari-50-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration</a>. </p>
<p>So if you don’t own an original cabinet, you can experience those amazing games on current gen hardware with a reproduction safely displayed on your wall.</p>
<p>The most popular of these titles, <em>Lunar Lander</em> and <em>Warlords</em>, currently retail for $245usd. And the additional three titles are currently on sale at 15% off at $208usd.</p>
<p>All five boards are available right now, and are not pre-order items. So you can expect your reproduction PCB to ship a few days after you order it.</p>
<p>This is something we appreciate in the growing pre-order culture in retro gaming products.</p>
<p>Overall this is a fun collector’s item if you happen to have the budget for it or are a big enough fan of arcade classics that you absolutely must have a reproduction board. </p>
