    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__docusaurus"><nav aria-label="Main"></nav><div id="__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback"><main><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="Powered by MDX" width="1009" height="717" src="https://docusaurus.io/img/undraw_typewriter.svg" loading="lazy"/></p><h3>Powered by MDX</h3><p>Save time and focus on text documents. Simply write docs and blog posts with MDX, and Docusaurus builds them into static HTML files ready to be served. You can even embed React components in your Markdown thanks to MDX.</p></div><div><p><img alt="Built Using React" width="1108" height="731" src="https://docusaurus.io/img/undraw_react.svg" loading="lazy"/></p><h3>Built Using React</h3><p>Extend and customize your project&#39;s layout by writing React components. Leverage the pluggable architecture, and design your own site while reusing the same data created by Docusaurus plugins.</p></div><div><p><img alt="Ready for Translations" width="1137" height="776" src="https://docusaurus.io/img/undraw_around_the_world.svg" loading="lazy"/></p><h3>Ready for Translations</h3><p>Localization comes out-of-the-box. Use git, Crowdin, or any other translation manager to translate your docs and deploy them individually.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img alt="Document Versioning" width="1038" height="693" src="https://docusaurus.io/img/undraw_version_control.svg" loading="lazy"/></p><h3>Document Versioning</h3><p>Support users on all versions of your project. Document versioning helps you keep documentation in sync with project releases.</p></div><div><p><img alt="Content Search" width="1137" height="736" src="https://docusaurus.io/img/undraw_algolia.svg" loading="lazy"/></p><h3>Content Search</h3><p>Make it easy for your community to find what they need in your documentation. We proudly support Algolia documentation search.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><h2>Check it out in the intro video</h2></div></div></div></div><div><div><h2>Loved by many engineers</h2><div><div><div><p>We&#39;ve been using Docusaurus for all the Redux org docs sites for the last couple years, and it&#39;s great! We&#39;ve been able to focus on content, customize some presentation and features, and It Just Works.</p></div><div><div><p>We&#39;ve been using V2 since January and it has been great - we spend less time building documentation and more time building üõ≥</p></div></div><div><p>The #IOTA wiki is now part of the <b>@docusaurus</b> showcase. We even have the honor of being a favorite. We are really happy that we found this project. It helped us a lot to improve the documentation. And we still have a lot of plans with things like tutorials, versioning and i8n.</p></div></div><div><div><p>I&#39;ve used Docusaurus for two websites this year, and I&#39;ve been very happy about the v2. Looks good, and simple to setup.</p></div><div><p>Continue to be impressed and excited about Docusaurus v2 alpha releases. Already using the sidebar items generator to help monorepo workspace devs create their own doc pages without any configuration needed.</p></div><div><div><p>http://testing-library.com just got a nice update! We&#39;re now on the latest version of <b>@docusaurus</b> thanks to @matanbobi, @TensorNo, and @nickemccurdy üíô</p></div></div></div><div><div><p>Docusaurus v2 doubles as a really nice little static site generator tool for content-focused sites, love it üëè</p></div><div><p>Been doing a lot of work with <b>@docusaurus</b> lately and I have to say it is really fun to work with. A lot of really cool features. I love that you can easily reuse content by creating a markdown file and importing it as a component. üî•</p></div><div><div><p>Happy to share Temporal&#39;s first open source sponsorship ‚Äî of</p><!-- --> <p><b>@docusaurus</b>!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Christopher &#34;vjeux&#34; Chedeau</p><p><small>Lead Prettier Developer</small></p></div></div><p>I&#39;ve helped open source many projects at Facebook and every one needed a website. They all had very similar constraints: the documentation should be written in markdown and be deployed via GitHub pages. I‚Äôm so glad that Docusaurus now exists so that I don‚Äôt have to spend a week each time spinning up a new one.</p></div><div><div><div><p>Hector Ramos</p><p><small>Lead React Native Advocate</small></p></div></div><p>Open source contributions to the React Native docs have skyrocketed after our move to Docusaurus. The docs are now hosted on a small repo in plain markdown, with none of the clutter that a typical static site generator would require. Thanks Slash!</p></div><div><div><div><p>Ricky Vetter</p><p><small>ReasonReact Developer</small></p></div></div><p>Docusaurus has been a great choice for the ReasonML family of projects. It makes our documentation consistent, i18n-friendly, easy to maintain, and friendly for new contributors.</p></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div>
