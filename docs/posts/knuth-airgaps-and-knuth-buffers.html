<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">decorated</a> darling of computer
science.</p>
<p>
Knuth knows how to maintain information hygeine.</p>
<h2>
Knuth Airgaps</h2>
<p>
Knuth is unreachable via digital communication. He
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_%28networking%29">airgaps</a> himself from
the internet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an
email address. I’d used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15
years of email is plenty for one lifetime. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>
He also maintains airgaps between his machines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I currently use Ubuntu Linux, on a standalone laptop—it has no Internet
connection. I occasionally carry flash memory drives between this machine and
the Macs that I use for network surfing and graphics; but I trust my family
jewels only to Linux. </p>

<h2>
Knuth Buffers</h2>
<p>
He buffers ideas on paper before putting them on machines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The kernel of the idea is first put on paper. Yeah, that’s where I write and
I’ll write maybe five programs a week. Of course, literate programming. And
these are before I describe something in my book, I always program it to see
how it’s working. </p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
I’m working on a research problem I generally begin by filling dozens of
sheets of scratch paper with partial calculations. When I eventually get to a
point where I can think about the problem while swimming, then I’m often ready
to solve it. </p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson">Neal Stephenson</a> – arguably one
of the best sci-fi authors of all time – maintains a Knuth Buffer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I seem to remember seeing the transcripts for the Baroque Cycle were all
handwritten. Are you still handwriting your books and if so, what advantages
do you think it has over using a computer? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Mostly handwritten, yes. It’s slower, and so each sentence spends longer in
the buffer before it gets written out, so first draft quality is higher. </p>
