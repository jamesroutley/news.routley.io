<p>One thing that <strong>school doesn’t teach you</strong> (not even high school) is <strong>how to manage your personal finances</strong>.</p>

<p>As my eldest son’s birthday was approaching, we suggested that instead of asking for physical gifts, he ask for their equivalent in money. That way, he gathered a <strong>decent amount of capital for his first investment adventure.</strong></p>

<p>I explained to my kids that <strong>investing is like having a magic box</strong> that generates more money over time. To make it more visual and interactive, I decided to create a small app where they could <strong>see their investment grow day by day</strong>.</p>

<hr/>



<p>My first idea was to build a <strong>physical piggy bank with a display</strong>, showing the accumulated amount. However, that mixed up the concept of <strong>saving</strong> with <strong>investing</strong>, and also required buying extra hardware.</p>

<p>So I looked for a quicker, cheaper way: <strong>revive an old smartphone</strong> and create a simple app using plain HTML.</p>

<p>The result was <strong>D-i<del>n</del>vestments</strong>, a mix between <em>Diversions</em> and <em>Investments</em>.</p>

<hr/>



<p>The app is essentially <strong>a single HTML file</strong> that installs on the phone as a <strong>PWA (Progressive Web App)</strong>.</p>

<p>The phone is <strong>attached to the fridge</strong> and works as a <strong>panel or dashboard</strong> where my kids can see <strong>their money growing each day.</strong></p>

<p>I act as their <strong>investment agent</strong>, assigning <strong>realistic interest rates</strong> — high enough to keep them motivated, but moderate enough to reflect how the real world works.</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="configuration-screen">Configuration Screen</h2>

<p>The app includes a screen where you can enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The kids’ names</li>
  <li>The invested amount</li>
  <li>The interest rate</li>
  <li>The start date</li>
</ul>

        <p><img src="https://roberdam.com/assets/images/pantacel1.jpg" alt="Configuration screen"/></p><p>Configuration screen</p>
    
</div>



<p>With that data, the app automatically calculates and displays:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Daily gain</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Weekly gain</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Monthly gain</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Total updated balance</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The process is as simple as opening the link from a smartphone and tapping <strong>“Install”</strong> when prompted by the browser.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Access the app:</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>



<p>The goal wasn’t just to teach my kids the value of money, but to <strong>show them visually how investment and time work as allies.</strong></p>

<p>Each day, as they watch their small fund grow, <strong>they grasp the magic of compound interest</strong> — and that, more than any gift, is a lesson I hope will stay with them for life.</p>
