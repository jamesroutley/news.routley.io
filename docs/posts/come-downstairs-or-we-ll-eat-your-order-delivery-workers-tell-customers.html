    <h1>Come downstairs or we’ll eat your order, delivery workers tell customers</h1>

<p>When a customer asked Pedro Júnior to bring the food he was delivering up to their apartment, he’d weigh his options: Take his bulky (and often heavy) bag up with him, or leave it behind and risk it being stolen? Júnior, who works for a food delivery app, has had his bag stolen twice already on the streets of Rio de Janeiro. One night, he told <em>Rest of World</em>, someone tried to steal his motorbike. “I came back to see someone had tampered with the chain with which I lock up my baby,” he said, using the pet name he has for his bike. That was the last straw. From then on, Júnior pledged that customers would either come down to get their food — or they’d go without it. </p>



<p>Customers pushed back, often reacting rudely when Júnior told them they’d need to come down to collect their order. So he turned to TikTok, and a trend was born: Júnior posts videos of himself arguing with customers over the intercom, while eating the unretrieved meals and singing a song he’s made up. “Se não descer, eu como mesmo,” it goes. (“If you don’t come down, I’ll eat it”). In one video, Júnior dances to the song with a group of other delivery drivers.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lgdastart/video/7220429469759098117">song’s debut went viral</a>, with 7.6 million views on TikTok and thousands of expressions of solidarity from customers and also workers who faced the same issue. Soon, other delivery drivers followed Júnior’s lead and began creating their own videos.</p>



<p>The social media trend showed how customers’ insistence on doorstep delivery is a common problem for Brazil’s almost 386,000 delivery app workers. It has since escalated into motorbike protests, with drivers honking and loudly revving up their bikes in front of apartment buildings. They have also taken their demands to local lawmakers. In two state capitals, Fortaleza and Porto Velho, delivery drivers have won the right to refuse requests to deliver inside apartment buildings.</p>



<p>According to Rappi and iFood, which control over 90% of Brazil’s app delivery market, drivers do not need to make doorstep deliveries. On paper, representatives from both companies told <em>Rest of World</em>, their rules already require delivery workers to only go as far as a street-level point of contact, from which customers are asked to collect their meals.</p>



<p>A common worry among drivers is that their cycles, motorbikes, or bags might be stolen if left unattended. Most buildings don’t allow them to park inside, workers told <em>Rest of World</em>, forcing them to leave their vehicles and delivery bags on the street. The bags frequently contain two or three orders as the apps assign them multiple deliveries along the same route. To avoid having the other orders stolen, the bags must also go up with the drivers.</p>

<p>But drivers also want to save time, as the process of getting through Brazil’s heavily guarded buildings can be time-consuming. It often involves checking in with a concierge and handing over an ID. Sometimes, biometric photo-registration may be required. The minutes spent delivering an order to the customer’s doorstep is time they could be using to complete other potential orders. “The more orders we deliver, the more money we make,” Júnior said.</p>



<p>When a customer refuses to come down, many now follow Júnior’s lead. They refuse, in turn, to deliver the order. Júnior said he tries to return undelivered meals when possible, but some restaurants, like McDonald’s — a frequent order in his videos — don’t accept returns and advise him to throw the food away. “When they tell me to toss [a meal], my understanding is that I’m free to do whatever I want with it,” he said. “I’m not going to throw it out, so either I give it to a homeless person, eat it myself, or take it home to my son.” </p>



<p>Beyond TikTok, delivery workers also vent to colleagues in Telegram groups. Videos on gig worker chat groups and on social media often show drivers being verbally assaulted by customers for refusing to carry an order upstairs. Recently, a popular delivery driver-turned-YouTuber made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23bYAUEZpLI">video</a> reacting to the humiliation of fellow drivers by customers. In one scene, a customer walks away with the food and ignores the driver’s plea for the delivery code — which confirms to the app that an order has been completed — hampering his ability to take other orders.</p>



<p>Arguments with customers have often escalated and <a href="https://www.sbtnews.com.br/noticia/primeiro-impacto/233910-descontrolada-cliente-agride-entregador-em-predio-no-df">led to violence</a>. In December 2022, <a href="https://g1.globo.com/df/distrito-federal/noticia/2022/12/12/entregadores-fazem-mais-um-protesto-no-df-apos-nova-briga-entre-motoboy-e-cliente-veja-video.ghtml">media reports </a>highlighted altercations between app users and delivery workers across Brasília — a few of which <a href="https://www.sbtnews.com.br/noticia/primeiro-impacto/233910-descontrolada-cliente-agride-entregador-em-predio-no-df">got physical</a>.</p>



<p>Given how often customers react aggressively, many drivers end up agreeing to take orders upstairs. “If we don’t, we risk getting a bad review from the client or even having our accounts reported,” Wellington Lopes, a delivery worker in Rio de Janeiro, told <em>Rest of World.</em> </p>



<p>As episodes of violence piled up in Brasília and surrounding cities, the Federal District Association for App Workers and Motorcyclists (ATAM-DF), an app workers’ organization, took legal action. They reached out to Fábio Félix, a local legislator from Brasília, who has been following app workers’ demands since 2019.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“IFood thinks we [falsely report food as undelivered] on purpose to eat the meals, but no, it really is tough being a delivery driver.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Abel Santos, vice president of the association, told <em>Rest of World</em> the workers created a draft bill and sent it over to Felix’s legal team for consideration. The draft, which establishes that workers should not be obligated to deliver within apartment buildings, is now being discussed in Brasília’s local legislature. Like Fortaleza’s existing doorstep delivery law, the Brasília draft provides exemptions for customers with reduced mobility or special needs.</p>



<p>According to Danilo Lopes, a councilman from Fortaleza, the widespread support for his city’s doorstep delivery law can also be attributed to its benefits for customers. “On the side of residents, there’s a fear of insecurity, as thieves have been passing themselves off as delivery drivers to gain access to apartments and commit robberies,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Projects aiming to grant workers the right to refuse doorstep delivery have so far been approved in three Brazilian cities: Valadares, Porto Velho, and Fortaleza. At least two others — Brasília and Manaus — are currently considering implementing similar legislation, with Rio de Janeiro considering a statewide law.</p>



<p>In Brasília, workers haven’t been waiting idly by as lawmakers discuss their petitions. They’ve been organizing on messaging apps, and protesting in front of the buildings where violence between workers and customers has taken place, across the city’s many upper-class neighborhoods. The local delivery workers’ association has not publicly endorsed the protests because its members are already involved with the draft bill and in legal proceedings helping some workers.</p>



<p>Júnior claimed his iFood account was blocked without explanation after he began posting videos; he doesn’t dismiss the possibility of a connection between the two. He’s now looking to get back into deliveries. “I’ll keep making videos,” he said, but added that he’d stop recording himself eating orders to minimize the risk of being blocked again. “IFood thinks we [falsely report food as undelivered] on purpose to eat the meals, but no,” said Júnior. “It really is tough being a delivery driver.”</p>
