    <h1>Facebook&#39;s Little Red Book</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Content" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>In 2012, Facebook was facing a challenge as it hit a billion users: rapid scaling was outpacing their ability to maintain focus on the big picture. Narratives became fragmented, and with them, the essence of what tied the company to Zuckerberg&#39;s vision began to fade.</p><p>They made a bold move by codifying their story into a <em>Little Red Book</em>. Which they distributed internally.</p><p>Created by designer <!--$--><a href="https://benbarry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben Barry</a><!--/$-->, the book distilled Facebook’s ethos—breaking things, thinking big, and moving fast—into a manifesto. More than a handbook, it was a declaration of identity, solving the problem of scaling culture during explosive growth. It reminded employees: <em>This is who we are. This is why we exist.</em></p><p>Few copies remain today, and most of the digital versions floating around the internet are low resolution.</p><p>After years of sporadically checking eBay, I found a copy. It arrived at our office a few weeks ago.</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,Il710XsKIqtIBh4o3bxWhOTafsI.png" data-framer-height="723" data-framer-width="1410" height="361" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/Il710XsKIqtIBh4o3bxWhOTafsI.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/Il710XsKIqtIBh4o3bxWhOTafsI.png?scale-down-to=512 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/Il710XsKIqtIBh4o3bxWhOTafsI.png?scale-down-to=1024 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/Il710XsKIqtIBh4o3bxWhOTafsI.png 1410w" width="705" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199px) 100vw, (max-width: 809px) 100vw"/></p><h6>Determined to create a <em>better</em> digital version, I reached out to a few public libraries and universities in NYC. One gave me access to their $150,000 DT-BC100 scanner.</h6><p>This isn’t just a scan of a book; it’s a testament to the power of storytelling.</p><p>Stories build belief. They turn strangers into teammates, teams into movements, and movements into businesses that can change the world.</p><p>So here it is, the highest quality publicly available version of the <em>Little Red Book</em>,<em> </em>preserved for anyone curious about how great companies scale culture and ideas.</p></div></div>
