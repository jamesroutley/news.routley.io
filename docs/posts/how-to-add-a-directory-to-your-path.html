    <h1>How to add a directory to your PATH</h1>
    
    <p>I was talking to a friend about how to add a directory to your PATH today. It&rsquo;s
something that feels &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; to me since I&rsquo;ve been using the terminal for a
long time, but when I searched for instructions for how to do it, I actually
couldn&rsquo;t find something that explained all of the steps &ndash; a lot of them just
said &ldquo;add this to <code>~/.bashrc</code>&rdquo;, but what if you&rsquo;re not using bash? What if your
bash config is actually in a different file? And how are you supposed to figure
out which directory to add anyway?</p>
<p>So I wanted to try to write down some more complete directions and mention some
of the gotchas I&rsquo;ve run into over the years.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-what-shell-are-you-using">step 1: what shell are you using?</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure what shell you&rsquo;re using, here&rsquo;s a way to find out. Run this:</p>
<pre><code>ps -p $$ -o pid,comm=
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>bash</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out <code>97295 bash</code></li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>zsh</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out <code>97295 zsh</code></li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>fish</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out an error like &ldquo;In fish, please use
$fish_pid&rdquo; (<code>$$</code> isn&rsquo;t valid syntax in fish, but in any case the error
message tells you that you&rsquo;re using fish, which you probably already knew)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also bash is the default on Linux and zsh is the default on Mac OS (as of
2024). I&rsquo;ll only cover bash, zsh, and fish in these directions.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-find-your-shell-s-config-file">step 2: find your shell&rsquo;s config file</h3>
<ul>
<li>in zsh, it&rsquo;s probably <code>~/.zshrc</code></li>
<li>in bash, it might be <code>~/.bashrc</code>, but it&rsquo;s complicated, see the note in the next section</li>
<li>in fish, it&rsquo;s probably <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code> (you can run <code>echo $__fish_config_dir</code> if you want to be 100% sure)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-note-on-bash-s-config-file">a note on bash&rsquo;s config file</h3>
<p>Bash has three possible config files: <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, and <code>~/.profile</code>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure which one your system is set up to use, I&rsquo;d recommend
testing this way:</p>
<ol>
<li>add <code>echo hi there</code> to your <code>~/.bashrc</code></li>
<li>Restart your terminal</li>
<li>If you see &ldquo;hi there&rdquo;, that means <code>~/.bashrc</code> is being used! Hooray!</li>
<li>Otherwise remove it and try the same thing with <code>~/.bash_profile</code></li>
<li>You can also try <code>~/.profile</code> if the first two options don&rsquo;t work.</li>
</ol>
<p>(there are a lot of elaborate flow charts out there that explain how bash
decides which config file to use but IMO it&rsquo;s not worth it and just testing is
the fastest way to be sure)</p>
<h3 id="step-3-figure-out-which-directory-to-add">step 3: figure out which directory to add</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re trying to install and run a program called <code>http-server</code>
and it doesn&rsquo;t work, like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server
bash: http-server: command not found
</code></pre>
<p>How do you find what directory <code>http-server</code> is in? Honestly in general this is
not that easy &ndash; often the answer is something like &ldquo;it depends on how npm is
configured&rdquo;. A few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often when setting up a new installer (like <code>cargo</code>, <code>npm</code>, <code>homebrew</code>, etc),
when you first set it up it&rsquo;ll print out some directions about how to update
your PATH. So if you&rsquo;re paying attention you can get the directions then.</li>
<li>Sometimes installers will automatically update your shell&rsquo;s config file
to update your <code>PATH</code> for you</li>
<li>Sometimes just Googling &ldquo;where does npm install things?&rdquo; will turn up the
answer</li>
<li>Some tools have a subcommand that tells you where they&rsquo;re configured to
install things, like:
<ul>
<li>Node/npm: <code>npm config get prefix</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>Go: <code>go env GOPATH</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>asdf: <code>asdf info | grep ASDF_DIR</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code> and <code>/shims/</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-1-double-check-it-s-the-right-directory">step 3.1: double check it&rsquo;s the right directory</h3>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve found a directory you think might be the right one, make sure it&rsquo;s
actually correct! For example, I found out that on my machine, <code>http-server</code> is
in <code>~/.npm-global/bin</code>. I can make sure that it&rsquo;s the right directory by trying to
run the program <code>http-server</code> in that directory like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ~/.npm-global/bin/http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./public
</code></pre>
<p>It worked! Now that you know what directory you need to add to your <code>PATH</code>,
let&rsquo;s move to the next step!</p>
<h3 id="step-4-edit-your-shell-config">step 4: edit your shell config</h3>
<p>Now we have the 2 critical pieces of information we need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which directory you&rsquo;re trying to add to your PATH (like  <code>~/.npm-global/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>Where your shell&rsquo;s config is (like <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.zshrc</code>, or <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now what you need to add depends on your shell:</p>
<p><strong>bash instructions:</strong></p>
<p>Open your shell&rsquo;s config file, and add a line like this:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin/
</code></pre>
<p>(obviously replace <code>~/.npm-global/bin</code> with the actual directory you&rsquo;re trying to add)</p>
<p><strong>zsh instructions:</strong></p>
<p>You can do the same thing as in bash, but zsh also has some slightly fancier
syntax you can use if you prefer:</p>
<pre><code>path=(
  $path
  ~/.npm-global/bin
)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>fish instructions:</strong></p>
<p>In fish, the syntax is different:</p>
<pre><code>set PATH $PATH ~/.npm-global/bin
</code></pre>
<p>(in fish you can also use <code>fish_add_path</code>, some notes on that <a href="#a-note-on-fish-add-path">further down</a>)</p>
<h3 id="step-5-restart-your-shell">step 5: restart your shell</h3>
<p>Now, an extremely important step: updating your shell&rsquo;s config won&rsquo;t take
effect if you don&rsquo;t restart it!</p>
<p>Two ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>open a new terminal (or terminal tab), and maybe close the old one so you don&rsquo;t get confused</li>
<li>Run <code>bash</code> to start a new shell (or <code>zsh</code> if you&rsquo;re using zsh, or <code>fish</code> if you&rsquo;re using fish)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that both of these usually work fine.</p>
<p>And you should be done! Try running the program you were trying to run and
hopefully it works now.</p>
<p>If not, here are a couple of problems that you might run into:</p>
<h3 id="problem-1-it-ran-the-wrong-program">problem 1: it ran the wrong program</h3>
<p>If the wrong <strong>version</strong> of a is program running, you might need to add the
directory to the <em>beginning</em> of your PATH instead of the end.</p>
<p>For example, on my system I have two versions of <code>python3</code> installed, which I
can see by running <code>which -a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ which -a python3
/usr/bin/python3
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
</code></pre>
<p>The one your shell will use is the <strong>first one listed</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to use the Homebrew version, you need to add that directory
(<code>/opt/homebrew/bin</code>) to the <strong>beginning</strong> of your PATH instead, by putting this in
your shell&rsquo;s config file (it&rsquo;s <code>/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH</code> instead of the usual <code>$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin/</code>)</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH
</code></pre>
<p>or in fish:</p>
<pre><code>set PATH ~/.cargo/bin $PATH
</code></pre>
<h3 id="problem-2-the-program-isn-t-being-run-from-your-shell">problem 2: the program isn&rsquo;t being run from your shell</h3>
<p>All of these directions only work if you&rsquo;re running the program <strong>from your
shell</strong>. If you&rsquo;re running the program from an IDE, from a GUI, in a cron job,
or some other way, you&rsquo;ll need to add the directory to your PATH in a different
way, and the exact details might depend on the situation.</p>
<p><strong>in a cron job</strong></p>
<p>Some options:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the full path to the program you&rsquo;re running, like <code>/home/bork/bin/my-program</code></li>
<li>put the full PATH you want as the first line of your crontab (something like
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:&hellip;.). You can get the full PATH you&rsquo;re
using in your shell by running <code>echo &quot;PATH=$PATH&quot;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly not sure how to handle it in an IDE/GUI because I haven&rsquo;t run into
that in a long time, will add directions here if someone points me in the right
direction.</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-duplicate-path-entries-making-it-harder-to-debug">problem 3: duplicate <code>PATH</code> entries making it harder to debug</h3>
<p>If you edit your path and start a new shell by running <code>bash</code> (or <code>zsh</code>, or
<code>fish</code>), you&rsquo;ll often end up with duplicate <code>PATH</code> entries, because the shell
keeps adding new things to your <code>PATH</code> every time you start your shell.</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve run into a situation where this kind of
duplication breaks anything, but the duplicates can make it harder to debug
what&rsquo;s going on with your <code>PATH</code> if you&rsquo;re trying to understand its contents.</p>
<p>Some ways you could deal with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you&rsquo;re debugging your <code>PATH</code>, open a new terminal to do it in so you get
a &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; state. This should avoid the duplication.</li>
<li>Deduplicate your <code>PATH</code> at the end of your shell&rsquo;s config  (for example in
zsh apparently you can do this with <code>typeset -U path</code>)</li>
<li>Check that the directory isn&rsquo;t already in your <code>PATH</code> when adding it (for
example in fish I believe you can do this with <code>fish_add_path --path /some/directory</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>How to deduplicate your <code>PATH</code> is shell-specific and there isn&rsquo;t always a
built in way to do it so you&rsquo;ll need to look up how to accomplish it in your
shell.</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-losing-your-history-after-updating-your-path">problem 4: losing your history after updating your <code>PATH</code></h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a situation that&rsquo;s easy to get into in bash or zsh:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run a command (it fails)</li>
<li>Update your <code>PATH</code></li>
<li>Run <code>bash</code> to reload your config</li>
<li>Press the up arrow a couple of times to rerun the failed command (or open a new terminal)</li>
<li>The failed command isn&rsquo;t in your history! Why not?</li>
</ol>
<p>This happens because in bash, by default, history is not saved until you exit
the shell.</p>
<p>Some options for fixing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of running <code>bash</code> to reload your config, run <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> (or
<code>source ~/.zshrc</code> in zsh). This will reload the config inside your current
session.</li>
<li>Configure your shell to continuously save your history instead of only saving
the history when the shell exits. (How to do this depends on whether you&rsquo;re
using bash or zsh, the history options in zsh are a bit complicated and I&rsquo;m
not exactly sure what the best way is)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-note-on-source">a note on <code>source</code></h3>
<p>When you install <code>cargo</code> (Rust&rsquo;s installer) for the first time, it gives you
these instructions for how to set up your PATH, which don&rsquo;t mention a specific
directory at all.</p>
<pre><code>This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):

. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;        	# For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env.fish&quot;  # For fish
</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that you add that line to your shell&rsquo;s config, and their script
automatically sets up your <code>PATH</code> (and potentially other things) for you.</p>
<p>This is pretty common (for example <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/deacfa6a6e62e5f4002baf9e1fac7a96e9aa5d41/install.sh#L1072-L1087">Homebrew</a> suggests you eval <code>brew shellenv</code>), and there are
two ways to approach this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just do what the tool suggests (like adding <code>. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;</code> to your shell&rsquo;s config)</li>
<li>Figure out which directories the script they&rsquo;re telling you to run would add
to your PATH, and then add those manually. Here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d do that:
<ul>
<li>Run <code>. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;</code> in my shell (or the fish version if using fish)</li>
<li>Run <code>echo &quot;$PATH&quot; | tr ':' '\n' | grep cargo</code> to figure out which directories it added</li>
<li>See that it says <code>/Users/bork/.cargo/bin</code> and shorten that to <code>~/.cargo/bin</code></li>
<li>Add the directory <code>~/.cargo/bin</code> to PATH (with the directions in this post)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with doing what the tool suggests (it
might be the &ldquo;best way&rdquo;!), but personally I usually use the second approach
because I prefer knowing exactly what configuration I&rsquo;m changing.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-fish-add-path">a note on <code>fish_add_path</code></h3>
<p>fish has a handy function called <code>fish_add_path</code> that you can run to add a directory to your <code>PATH</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>fish_add_path /some/directory
</code></pre>
<p>This is cool (it&rsquo;s such a simple command!) but I&rsquo;ve stopped using it for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes <code>fish_add_path</code> will update the <code>PATH</code> for every session in the
future (with a &ldquo;universal variable&rdquo;) and sometimes it will update the <code>PATH</code>
just for the current session and it&rsquo;s hard for me to tell which one it will
do. In theory the docs explain this but I could not understand them.</li>
<li>If you ever need to <em>remove</em> the directory from your <code>PATH</code> a few weeks or
months later because maybe you made a mistake, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to do
(there are <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8604">instructions in this comments of this github issue though</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all</h3>
<p>Hopefully this will help some people. Let me know (on Mastodon or Bluesky) if
you there are other major gotchas that have tripped you up when adding a
directory to your PATH, or if you have questions about this post!</p>
