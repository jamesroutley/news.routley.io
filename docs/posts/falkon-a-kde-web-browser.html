Notable changes There is a handful of changes in this release.
KWallet The format under which the passwords are stored has changed from Binary to Map. The passwords can now be viewed from within KWalletManager and even edited. While editing and adding new ones I would be careful with the data field and updated that as well. (This is some Falkon password internal mechanic) The Folder under which the passwords are stored changed from Falkon to FalkonPasswords. This was done to not overwrite the old passwords and potentialy ruin them during the migration to new format.
