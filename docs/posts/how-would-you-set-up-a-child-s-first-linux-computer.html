    <h1>Ask HN: How would you set up a child’s first Linux computer?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As a tech parent I think one of the best things I did for both my son and daughter was for their first computer to help them to build and setup their own Linux computer (It was Ubuntu back then but they’ve both moved themselves to Arch these days).</p><p>We went together and bought a second hand desktop (exciting the people selling to us also) and when I got home I pulled out the Ram, HD and CD drive and set them aside; and then together with a screwdriver we “built the computer” over a few days.</p><p>In windows when a child goes searching the web for a “movie maker for windows” they are going to be in a world of hurt either finding expensive commercial options or super scammy sites promising the world.</p><p>By comparison on Linux if they search the local “app store” they’ll find stacks and stacks of free, useful, open licensed software.</p><p>My kids loved the power, freedom and later unexpected community this bought them.</p><p>Now my friend wants the same for their daughter who is 8 years old.</p><p>I’m planning to do the same and go with her parents and her and buy a second hand desktop together and then put Linux on it.</p><p>My question is where would you go from there? What suggestions do you have? What to install? Any mini “curriculums” or ideas?</p><p>Would love to hear your ideas and experiences. Linux with free and open software is the goal and focus.</p></div></div></div>
