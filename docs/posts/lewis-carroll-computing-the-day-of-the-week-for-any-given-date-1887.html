			<p>A letter from Lewis Carroll to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/035517a0"><em>Nature</em></a>, March 31, 1887:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Having hit upon the following method of mentally computing the day of the week for any given date, I send it you in the hope that it may interest some of your readers. I am not a rapid computer myself, and as I find my average time for doing any such question is about 20 seconds, I have little doubt that a rapid computer would not need 15.</p>
<p>Take the given date in 4 portions, viz. the number of centuries, the number of years over, the month, the day of the month.</p>
<p>Compute the following 4 items, adding each, when found, to the total of the previous items. When an item or total exceeds 7, divide by 7, and keep the remainder only.</p>
<p><em>The Century-Item.</em> — For Old Style (which ended September 2, 1752) subtract from 18. For New Style (which began September 14) divide by 4, take overplus from 3, multiply remainder by 2. [The Century-Item is the first two digits of the year, so for 1811 take 18.]</p>
<p><em>The Year-Item.</em> — Add together the number of dozens, the overplus, and the number of 4’s in the overplus.</p>
<p><em>The Month-Item.</em> — If it begins or ends with a vowel, subtract the number, denoting its place in the year, from 10. This, plus its number of days, gives the item for the following month. The item for January is ‘0’; for February or March (the 3rd month), ‘3’; for December (the 12th month), ’12.’ [So, for clarity, the required final numbers after division by 7 are January, 0; February, 3; March, 3; April, 6; May, 1; June, 4; July, 6; August 2; September, 5; October, 0; November, 3; and December, 5.]</p>
<p><em>The Day-Item</em> is the day of the month.</p>
<p>The total, thus reached, must be corrected, by deducting ‘1’ (first adding 7, if the total be ‘0’), if the date be January or February in a Leap Year: remembering that every year, divisible by 4, is a Leap Year, excepting only the century-years, in New Style, when the number of centuries is <em>not</em> so divisible (<em>e.g.</em> 1800).</p>
<p>The final result gives the day of the week, ‘0’ meaning Sunday, ‘1’ Monday, and so on.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>1783, <em>September</em> 18</p>
<p>17, divided by 4, leaves ‘1’ over; 1 from 3 gives ‘2’; twice 2 is ‘4.’</p>
<p>83 is 6 dozen and 11, giving 17; plus 2 gives 19, <em>i.e.</em> (dividing by 7) ‘5.’ Total 9, <em>i.e.</em> ‘2.’</p>
<p>The item for August is ‘8 from 10,’ <em>i.e.</em> ‘2’; so, for September, it is ‘2 plus 3,’ <em>i.e.</em> ‘5.’ Total 7, <em>i.e.</em> ‘0,’ which goes out.</p>
<p>18 gives ‘4.’ Answer, <em>‘Thursday.’</em></p>
<p>1676, <em>February</em> 23</p>
<p>16 from 18 gives ‘2.’</p>
<p>76 is 6 dozen and 4, giving 10; plus 1 gives 11, <em>i.e.</em> ‘4.’ Total ‘6.’</p>
<p>The item for February is ‘3.’ Total 9, <em>i.e.</em> ‘2.’</p>
<p>23 gives ‘2.’ Total ‘4.’</p>
<p>Correction for Leap Year gives ‘3.’ Answer, <em>‘Wednesday.’</em>
