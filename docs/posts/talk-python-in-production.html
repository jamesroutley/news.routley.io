                <p>
                    Welcome to <strong>Talk Python in Production</strong>, a hands-on guide for Python developers
                    determined to master
                    real-world deployment and infrastructure management. Have you ever felt locked into pricey cloud
                    services or struggled with overly complex DevOps configurations? This book&#39;s <em>stack-native</em>
                    approach offers a refreshing alternative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You&#39;ll learn to containerize Python apps, secure them with NGINX,
                    tap into CDNs for global performance, and manage everything on a single, powerful server, without
                    sacrificing reliability. Along the way, you&#39;ll see exactly how we evolved Talk Python&#39;s own web
                    infrastructure over many years of practical deployment experience.
                    <strong>This isn&#39;t just theory: discover cost-saving tips, real-world examples, and step-by-step
                        tutorials you can put to use right away.</strong>
                    By the end, you&#39;ll be confident in running your Python applications at scale, with minimal cloud
                    lock-in and maximum control over your technology stack.

                    This book is ideal for Python developers who want:

                    </p><ul>
                        <li>More control over their web application deployments.</li>
                        <li>To reduce reliance on deeply integrated, &#34;cloud-native&#34; services.</li>
                        <li>Hands-on examples for using Docker, NGINX, Python web frameworks, databases, CDNs, and
                            more -- all from a practical &#34;stack-native&#34; perspective.
                        </li>
                    </ul><p>

                    If you consider yourself comfortable writing Python but find deployment or DevOps a bit intimidating
                    (or overly expensive), <em>Talk Python in Production</em> was written for you.

                <div>
                    <h3>What does &#34;stack-native&#34; mean?</h3>
                    <p><img src="https://cdn-podcast.talkpython.fm/static/img/python-in-production-book/2-server.webp" alt=""/></p><p>
                        &#34;Stack-native&#34; is an alternative deployment philosophy to &#34;cloud-native.&#34; Instead of outsourcing
                        dozens of microservices to a hyperscale cloud, you run much of your app on a single, powerful
                        server (e.g., via Docker Compose). This keeps the complexity and cost far lower, avoids lock-in,
                        and is typically manageable by a small team -- or even a single developer.

                        The book includes a total of 1 hour and 20 minutes of short 2 to 4 minute conversations that
                        bookend each chapter. Use them to prime your
                        focus before reading or to broaden your takeaways after. They complement the code-heavy text
                        without trying to be a word-for-word audiobook; expect the occasional quirky acronym. Preview a

                        The book doesn&#39;t assume deep DevOps knowledge. Readers with moderate Python experience, plus
                        some comfort using Linux terminals and basic web deployment concepts, should be able to follow
                        along. It progressively introduces Docker, NGINX, and other tools with concrete, real-world
                        examples. However, it&#39;s not a basic &#34;Hello World&#34; tutorial -- it deals with production-scale
                        considerations like security patches, automated deployments, container orchestration, and cost
                        optimization.

                        No. While having some exposure to Docker or Linux server administration helps, the text walks
                        you through setting up and managing a modern Docker-based deployment from scratch. Think of it
                        as a guided tour of these technologies, with best practices and pitfalls explained along the
                        way.

                        <li><strong>Other frameworks</strong> get honorable mentions (e.g., Django, FastAPI), but the
                            main focus is on the lessons learned migrating from a legacy framework to a modern
                            async-first one.

                        blindsided by unpredictable bills. The book showcases real monthly costs (often under $100) for

                    <p>We explore how Talk Python outgrew PythonAnywhere and transitioned to dedicated Linux VMs. Starting with a PaaS was ideal for testing podcast waters, but maintenance downtime and limited control prompted the shift. DigitalOcean offered a simpler, more affordable alternative to hyperscale providers like AWS. With eight small VMs running various apps, podcasts, courses, APIs, the approach worked but introduced complexities, especially around updates and reboots. Ultimately, dividing apps across multiple servers didn’t deliver the expected isolation, simplicity, or cost savings. This chapter highlights the lessons learned, paving the way for a more efficient, containerized hosting environment in future chapters.</p>

                    <p>Learn how Talk Python escaped the complexity and costs of hyperscale cloud platforms, inspired by David Heinemeier Hansson’s <em>We have left the cloud</em> journey. Instead of maintaining multiple VMs, we consolidated everything into a single, powerful server running Docker and Docker Compose for seamless app isolation and portability. Enjoy a simpler, faster, and cloud-agnostic setup; without rewriting apps for proprietary services or sacrificing performance and reliability.</p>

                    <p>See why Talk Python ditched multiple small servers for a single, larger machine with eight vCPUs and 16 GB RAM. Although the total compute power is the same, consolidating everything under one server simplifies updates, as only one machine needs patching, and dramatically increases peak performance. When each web app spikes separately, it can tap into nearly all eight CPUs, rather than being limited to a small VM. This approach provides 4-8x more capacity for critical moments at roughly the same price. Explore how Docker-based isolation still protects each app while allowing full compute sharing and streamlined management.</p>

Instead, this chapter introduces &#34;stack-native&#34;: a philosophy centered on running just enough containers (e.g., Flask, NGINX, Granian, and a database) on one well-chosen VM. It avoids vendor lock-in, scales seamlessly for many real-world apps, and remains fully owned by your small team. You’ll see why this approach, replete with Docker orchestration, custom volumes, and self-hosted databases, achieves the reliability of Kubernetes without the complexity or runaway cloud costs.</p>

                    <p>In Chapter 18: Conclusion, we finalize the journey of “stack-native” development, where simplicity, flexibility, and cost-effective ownership are front and center. You’ve seen how to deploy Python apps using Docker, NGINX, container orchestration, and more, all on a single, powerful VM. This approach ensures minimal complexity, straightforward management, and maximum autonomy. Whether you adopt all these practices or adapt only a few, you now have the tools and confidence to run Python in production, without lock-in or unnecessary cloud-native overhead.
