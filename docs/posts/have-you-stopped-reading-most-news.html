    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I say “most” because you’re reading this on HN.</p><p>I haven’t had FB for over 6 years and I don’t use Twitter. I primarily find the internet to be a distraction these days and considering just phasing out news all together for weeks at a time. Has anyone done something similar?</p><p>In the past people have been harsh to call me ill informed for not being up to date on all things media, but to what end does this actually benefit the individual? My argument is that it’s mostly a detriment given the state of the world.</p><p>For those that have experimented with “going dark” in a sense, how was it, what did you do and what’s a good balance?</p></div></div></div>
