          <p dir="auto">Your GitHub repo looks like it&#39;s used, or can potentially be used, as a weapon by providers trying to rob users of one of the few defenses they have to their email address leaking, a scarily common occurrence, which are then weaponized by bad actors to flood those users&#39; inboxes with spam.</p>
<p dir="auto">Can you not do this? You look like extremely bad actors. Please don&#39;t contribute to an unsafe internet.</p>
<p dir="auto">I use Private Relay to protect my personal mail address, not as a tool for spam. I&#39;m not even sure how a user would use Private Relay for spam, as users cannot begin email chains with a Relay address, only respond to mails delivered to those addresses.</p>
