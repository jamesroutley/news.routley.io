I’ve long imagined a tool that would enable a teacher to help students learn how to write and edit. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2015/01/12/thoughts-in-motion/">Thoughts in motion</a> I explored what might be possible in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/tag/fedwiki/&#34;">Federated Wiki</a>, a writing tool that keeps version history for each paragraph. I thought it could be extended to enable the kind of didactic editing I have in mind, but never found a way forward.</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/08/13/how-to-rewrite-a-press-release-a-step-by-step-guide/">How to write a press release</a> I tried bending Google Docs to this purpose. To narrate the process of editing a press release, I dropped a sample release into a GDoc and captured a series of edits as named versions. Then I captured the versions as screenshots and combined them with narration, so the reader of the blog post can see each edit as a color-coded diff with an explanation.</p>
<p>
The key enabler is GDoc’s <tt>File -&gt; Version history -&gt; Name current version</tt>, along with <tt>File -&gt; See version history</tt>‘s click-driven navigation of the set of diffs. It’s easy to capture a sequence of editing steps that way. </p>
<p>
But it’s much harder to <i>present</i> those steps as I do in the post. That required me to make, name, and organize a set of images, then link them to chunks of narration. It’s tedious work. And if you want to build something like this for students, that’s work you shouldn’t be doing. You just want to do the edits, narrate them, and share the result.</p>
<p>
This week I tried a different approach when editing a document written by a colleague. Again the goal was not only to produce an edited version, but also to narrate the edits in a didactic way. In this case I tried bending GitHub to my purpose. I put the original doc in a repository, made step-by-step edits in a branch, and created a pull request. We were then able to review the pull request, step through the changes, and review each as a color-coded diff with an explanation. No screenshots had to be made, named, organized, or linked to the narration. I could focus all my attention on doing and narrating the edits. Perfect!</p>
<p>
Well, perfect for someone like me who uses GitHub every day. If that’s not you, could this technique possibly work?</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2886828/github-for-the-rest-of-us.html">GitHub for the rest of us</a> I argued that GitHub’s superpowers could serve everyone, not just programmers. In retrospect I felt that I’d overstated the case. GitHub was, and remains, a tool that’s deeply optimized for programmers who create and review versioned source code. Other uses are possible, but awkward. </p>
<p>
As an experiment, though, let’s explore how awkward it would be to recreate my Google Docs example in GitHub. I will assume that you aren’t a programmer, have never used GitHub, and don’t know (or want to know) anything about branches or commits or pull requests. But you would like to be able to create a presentation that walks a learner though a sequence of edits, with step-by-step narration and color-coded diffs. At the end of this tutorial you’ll know how to do that. The method isn’t as straightforward as I wish it were. But I’ll describe it carefully, so you can try it for yourself and decide whether it’s practical.</p>
<p>
Here’s the final result of the technique I’ll describe.</p>
<p><span><iframe width="656" height="369" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CbyrxXlKV9A?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>
If you want to replicate that, and don’t already have a GitHub account, create one now and log in.</p>
<p>
Ready to go? OK, let’s get started.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Create a repository</h2>
<p>
Click the <b>+</b> button in the top right corner, then click <b>New repository</b>.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-00.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-00.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<p>
Here’s the next screen. All you must do here is name the repository, e.g. <i>editing-step-by-step</i>, then click <tt>Create repository</tt>. I’ve ticked the <tt>Add a README file</tt> box, and chosen the Apache 2.0 license, but you could leave the defaults — box unchecked, license None — as neither matters for our purpose here.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-01.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-01.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<h2>Step 2: Create a new file</h2>
<p>
On your GitHub home page, click the <tt>Repositories</tt> tab. Your new repo shows up first. Click its link to open it, then click the <tt>Add file</tt> dropdown and choose <tt>Create new file</tt>. Here’s where you land.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-03a.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-03a.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<h2>Step 3: Add the original text, create a new branch, commit the change, and create a pull request</h2>
<p>
What happens on the next screen is bewildering, but I will spare you the details because I’m assuming you don’t want to know about branches or commits or pull requests, you just want to build the kind of presentation I’ve promised you can. So, just follow this recipe.</p>
<ul>
<li>Name the file (e.g. <tt>sample-press-release.txt</tt>
</li><li>Copy/paste the text of the document into the edit box
</li><li>Select <tt>Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request</tt>
</li><li>Name the branch (e.g. <tt>edits</tt>)
</li><li>Click <tt>Propose new file</tt>
</li></ul>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-03.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-03.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<p>
On the next screen, title the pull request (e.g. <tt>edit the press release</tt>) and click <tt>Create pull request</tt>.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-04.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-04.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<h2>Step 4: Visit the new branch and begin editing</h2>
<p>
On the home page of your repo, use the <tt>main</tt> dropdown to open the list of branches. There are now two: <tt>main</tt> and <tt>edits</tt>. Select <tt>edits</tt></p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-06.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-06.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<p>
Here’s the next screen. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-07.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-07.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<p>
Click the name of the document you created (e.g. <tt>sample-press-release.txt</tt> to open it.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-08.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-08.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<p>
Click the pencil icon’s dropdown, and select <tt>Edit this file</tt>.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-09.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-09.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<p>
Make and preview your first edit. Here, that’s my initial rewrite of the headline. I’ve written a title for the commit (<tt>Step 1: revise headline</tt>), and I’ve added a detailed explanation in the box below the title. You can see the color-coded diff above, and the rationale for the change below. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-10.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-10.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<p>
Click <tt>Commit changes</tt>, and you’re back in the editor ready to make the next change.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-11.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-11.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<h2>Step 5: Visit the pull request to review the change</h2>
<p>On your repo’s home page (e.g. <tt><a href="https://github.com/judell/editing-step-by-step" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/judell/editing-step-by-step</a></tt>), click the <tt>Pull requests</tt> button. You’ll land here.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-12.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-12.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<p>
Click the name of the pull request (e.g. <tt>edit the press release</tt>) to open it. In the rightmost column you’ll see links with alphanumeric labels. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-13.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-13.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<p>
Click the first one of those to land here.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-14.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-14.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<p>
This is the first commit, the one that added the original text. Now click <tt>Next</tt> to review the first change.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-15.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/step-by-step-15.jpg?w=656&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></p>
<p>
This, finally, is the effect we want to create: a granular edit, with an explanation and a color-coded diff, encapsulated in a <a href="https://github.com/judell/editing-step-by-step/pull/1/commits/de67cf6b75f0de9da82b821e82ed1d8457fb7562">link</a> that you can give to a learner who can then click <tt>Next</tt> to step through a series of narrated edits.</p>
<h2>Lather, rinse, repeat</h2>
<p>
To continue building the presentation, repeat Step 4 (above) once per edit. I’m doing that now.</p>
<p>
… time passes …</p>
<p>
OK, done. Here’s the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/judell/editing-step-by-step/edits/sample-press-release.txt">final edited copy</a>. To step through the edits, start <a href="https://github.com/judell/editing-step-by-step/pull/1/commits/de67cf6b75f0de9da82b821e82ed1d8457fb7562">here</a> and use the <tt>Next</tt> button to advance step-by-step.</p>
<p>
If this were a software project you’d merge the <tt>edits</tt> branch into the <tt>main</tt> branch and close the pull request. But you don’t need to worry about any of that. The <tt>edits</tt> branch, with its open pull request, is the final product, and the link to the first commit in the pull request is how you make it available to a learner who wants to review the presentation.</p>
<p>
GitHub enables what I’ve shown here by wrapping the byzantine complexity of the underlying tool, Git, in a much friendlier interface. But what’s friendly to a programmer is still pretty overwhelming for an English teacher. I still envision another layer of packaging that would make this technique simpler for teachers and learners focused on the craft of writing and editing. Meanwhile, though, it’s possible to use GitHub to achieve a compelling result. Is it practical? That’s not for me to say, I’m way past being able to see this stuff through the eyes of a beginner. But if that’s you, and you’re motivated to give this a try, I would love to know whether you’re able to follow this recipe, and if so whether you think it could help you to help learners become better writers and editors.</p>
