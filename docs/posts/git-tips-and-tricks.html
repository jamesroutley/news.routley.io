For the last decade or so, I&#39;ve sort of assumed that everyone knew all the advanced command line stuff by now.</p><p>However, in the last few months I’ve been back on the speaking circuit, talking about Git and GitButler and I’ve found that <em>lots</em> of people don’t know a <em>lot</em> of stuff about Git.</p><p>There is a whole generation of developers who just grew up only using Git, never having to switch to it from something else or relearn previous concepts from SVN or CVS or whatever.</p><p>Additionally, there are a few things that Git can do now that wasn’t possible years ago. Git has learned some stuff. Most of the changes are subtle or very targeted, but they could be useful to people, so I figured this would be a good time to do a little survey of some interesting Git things that might be new to you for whatever reason.</p><p>There are a million things, but I&#39;m going to narrow them down to &#34;still too many for one blog post&#34;, so instead I&#39;ll do a small series covering a few topics each.</p><h2 id="the-series">The Series</h2><p>So, I&#39;m going to write 3 short articles on some interesting Git things for intermediate to advanced Git users that you may not know, either because they just never came up or because they&#39;re pretty new and you&#39;ve been using Git the same way for years.</p><p>The topics are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.gitbutler.com/git-tips-1-theres-a-git-config-for-that/" rel="noreferrer">Oldies but Goodies</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.gitbutler.com/git-tips-2-new-stuff-in-git/" rel="noreferrer">Some Subtle New Things</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.gitbutler.com/git-tips-3-really-large-repositories/" rel="noreferrer">Really Large Repositories and Monorepos</a></li></ul><p>I hope you find something interesting in there. Git continues to surprise even me, so have fun exploring!</p><p>Let&#39;s start with <a href="https://blog.gitbutler.com/git-tips-1-theres-a-git-config-for-that/" rel="noreferrer">Oldies but Goodies</a>!</p>
