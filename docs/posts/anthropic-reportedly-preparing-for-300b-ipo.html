    <h1>Anthropic reportedly preparing for $300B IPO</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>San Francisco-based <strong>Anthropic</strong> has asked Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati to begin work on an initial public offering (IPO) that could take place as early as 2026, the Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3254fa30-5bdb-4c30-8560-7cd7ebbefc5f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> this week.</p>



<p>The move positions the company, best known for its Claude chatbot, to reach the stock market ahead of rival OpenAI and would test investors’ willingness to fund large, loss-making artificial-intelligence labs. People familiar with the plans cautioned that discussions with investment banks remain informal and that no underwriting line-up has been chosen.</p>




<p><strong>Wilson Sonsini</strong>, which advised Anthropic on its multibillion-dollar investment agreements with Amazon and Google, has <a href="https://www.wsgr.com/en/services/practice-areas/corporate/capital-markets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously</a> guided Google, LinkedIn and Lyft to market.</p>



<p>In a statement, an Anthropic spokesperson said: “We have not made any decisions about when, or even whether, to go public.”</p>



<p>The IPO preparations coincide with a private fundraising round that could value Anthropic above $300 billion. Microsoft and Nvidia have jointly committed $15 billion to that round, according to the Financial Times, while Anthropic has pledged to spend $30 billion on Microsoft’s cloud platform over the next four years. A previous funding round this autumn pegged the company at roughly $183 billion.</p>



<p>Chief executive Dario Amodei has told investors that annualised revenue could rise to $26 billion next year, triple this year’s run-rate, as the customer base expands beyond 300,000 businesses.</p>



<p>Internal changes aimed at satisfying public-market requirements are already under way. Last year Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/krishna-rao-joins-anthropic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired</a> Airbnb’s former head of corporate finance, <strong>Krishna Rao</strong>, as chief financial officer and has since worked through governance, accounting and disclosure checklists, one source said.</p>




<p>OpenAI, valued at about $500 billion after a recent share sale, is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-lays-groundwork-juggernaut-ipo-up-1-trillion-valuation-2025-10-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducting</a> similar early-stage work but chief financial officer Sarah Friar said last month that a listing is “not in the near-term plan.”</p>



<p>Both companies face the challenge of forecasting profits while spending heavily on model training and infrastructure. Anthropic recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/anthropic-invest-50-billion-build-data-centers-us-2025-11-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a $50 billion build-out of data centres in Texas and New York and plans to triple its global workforce.</p>
