<p>(1)  If you’re inclined to be pedantic about the plural of “octopus”, pause and ask yourself this question:  “Am I a sophomore in college?”  If yes, please go right ahead!  If no… dude.</p>
<p>(2) They could actually control their buoyancy, and in a very cool way, but this post is really long enough already.</p>
<p>(3)  If you’re inclined to be pedantic about the nautilus’ limbs and say that /actually/ they are “arms” and not “tentacles” because tentacles have suckers on them, then (a) congratulations on remembering that long-ago biology class, and (b) see Footnote 1, above.</p>
<p>(4) Yes I am aware of walruses and elephant seals.  Most seals are medium-sized animals, human size or smaller.  As for being an apex predator, seals are a very popular food item for the larger sharks, and even leopard seals get bodied by orcas.</p>

						<p>There seems to be an obvious logical flaw here. Cephalopods without shells, that are just as tasty, are doing just fine, and there are a lot more critters that eat them than just seals.</p>

<p>@4, what flaw?  Cephalopods without shells are either much faster and more maneuverable (squid) or mostly hang out on or near the ocean floor (octopi) where, if threatened, they can suddenly squeeze their amorphous bodies into the tiniest of shelters.  Or they’re cuttlefish, who do both. Also, most non-armored cephalopods can change color, allowing some very sophisticated camouflage; can’t do that with armor on.</p>
<p>(There are some interesting edge cases.  The vampire squid is not a squid, but rather a rare octopus that hangs out in open water instead of crawling along the bottom.  It survives because (1) it mostly lurks in deep, low-oxygen waters with almost no predators, and (2) it has an <em>astonishing</em> threat display.)</p>

<p>“Cephalopods without shells, that are just as tasty, are doing just fine, and there are a lot more critters that eat them than just seals.”</p>
<p>A key difference is their reproduction.  Checking wikipedia, the chambered nautilus takes 5 years to reach maturity, which is longer than most octopi even live: “Unlike most other octopus species, whose lifespans normally span only one year, the giant Pacific octopus has a lifespan of three to five years”.  Even the giant squid “are thought to reach sexual maturity at about three years old”.</p>
<p>Why are nautiloids so slow?  According to my notes from <i>Squid Empire</i>, they have big eggs and thick shells. Ammonoids evolved to have lots of eggs, thinner shells with complex sutures for strength, and faster growth.  Probably why they evolved more diversity, but maybe also part of why they didn’t pass the K-T boundary, while nautiloids might have survived a dearth of plankton better.</p>
<p>At any rate, they <em>are</em> slow.  Shell-less cephs can better survive predation via massive spawning and rapid growth, in addition to their other advantages Doug described.</p>

						<p>“Ammonoids evolved to have lots of eggs, thinner shells with complex sutures for strength, and faster growth.” Well okay, but if that’s really the story nautiloids could have evolved to mature and reproduce faster — fish hunted by humans did that in a few generations. Also, seals have to mate, give birth, and rest on land so they are limited to coastal areas. Predation by seals has no effect on pelagic species.</p>

<p>“Also, seals have to mate, give birth, and rest on land so they are limited to coastal areas.”</p>
<p>— That’s a hard “incorrect”.  Seals don’t need to rest on land.  They do still come ashore to give birth and nurse young pups, true enough.  But that’s only for a few weeks per year.  The rest of the time, they’re completely free of land.</p>
<p>It’s not at all unusual for seals to travel thousands of miles from their rookeries.  Some species, it’s true, like to hug the shore — monk seals, harbor seals — and others, like the walrus, don’t like to leave the continental shelf.  But elephant seals, leopard seals, northern fur seals, crab-eating seals and a bunch of others are absolutely long-distance predators.   Like, northern elephant seals?  Breed on the coast of California… and have been recorded as far west as Hawaii, ~3000 miles away.</p>
<p>TLDR: many, perhaps most species of seals will cheerfully turn up in mid-ocean, far from land, if there’s anything there for them to eat.</p>
