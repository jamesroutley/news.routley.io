<p>“Cephalopods without shells, that are just as tasty, are doing just fine, and there are a lot more critters that eat them than just seals.”</p>
<p>A key difference is their reproduction.  Checking wikipedia, the chambered nautilus takes 5 years to reach maturity, which is longer than most octopi even live: “Unlike most other octopus species, whose lifespans normally span only one year, the giant Pacific octopus has a lifespan of three to five years”.  Even the giant squid “are thought to reach sexual maturity at about three years old”.</p>
<p>Why are nautiloids so slow?  According to my notes from <i>Squid Empire</i>, they have big eggs and thick shells. Ammonoids evolved to have lots of eggs, thinner shells with complex sutures for strength, and faster growth.  Probably why they evolved more diversity, but maybe also part of why they didn’t pass the K-T boundary, while nautiloids might have survived a dearth of plankton better.</p>
<p>At any rate, they <em>are</em> slow.  Shell-less cephs can better survive predation via massive spawning and rapid growth, in addition to their other advantages Doug described.</p>
