    <h1>AGI Safety is Important</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve over the last couple of weeks become totally engulfed in the AI safety space. I’m not sure why it’s taken me so long. I think GPT-3/4 capabilities shined a new light on what is possible with current state of the art systems, and it somehow intrigued me enough that when I stumbled on <a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/most-important-century/">this</a> blog post, I became completely hooked.</p><p>The blog post above explains it better than I ever could, but the most convincing thought to me was:</p><ul><li>There does not seem to be any inherent restrictions on AI becoming smarter than humans.</li><li>When this happens, we better make sure they value humans and their wants and needs - if not, why would this super-intelligent AI ever treat us better than chickens in factory farms?</li></ul><p>This is definitely out there, I know. But all ideas are out there until they become reality. If you want to debate me on this, I would LOVE to. Please convince me this is not a potential problem.</p><p>After being convinced by the arguments above, another consequence is that <strong>everything else feels very unimportant in comparison</strong>. The only developments that “matter” are the ones that matter before this potential AGI shift, which very well could be within the coming century.</p><p>I’m currently speed-running the <a href="https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/ai-alignment-curriculum">AGI Safety Fundamentals</a> course, and am thinking of applying to the <a href="https://www.serimats.org/">MATS Program</a> for this summer. I’m not a believer in fate, but I am incredibly happy I studied applied mathematics! Certainly helps with getting up to speed in the space.</p><p>I’m very interested in hearing from others that are interested in or working in the area.</p></div></div>
