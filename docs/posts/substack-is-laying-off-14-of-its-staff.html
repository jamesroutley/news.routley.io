He said he wanted the company to seek funding from a position of strength if it decided to raise again.</p></div><div><div><p>In his remarks to employees, Mr. Best said the company’s revenues were increasing. He noted that Substack still had money in the bank and was continuing to hire, albeit at a slower place, the person said. Mr. Best said the cuts would allow the company to hone its focus on product and engineering.</p><p>Months earlier, Substack <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/26/business/media/substack-venture-capital.html" title="">scrapped a plan</a> to raise additional funding after the market for venture investments cooled. The company had discussions about raising $75 million to $100 million to fuel its growth, and some of the fund-raising discussions valued the company between $750 million and $1 billion.</p><p>Substack, which takes a cut of its writers’ subscription fees, generated about $9 million in revenue last year, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/26/business/media/substack-venture-capital.html" title="">reported</a>. That means the funding discussions valued the company at a hefty premium relative to its financial results. Substack was said to be valued at $650 million last year after it closed a $65 million funding round.</p><p>Many media companies are anticipating headwinds in the coming months as the broader economy shows signs of strain. Advertising revenue could dry up as companies cut their marketing budgets to conserve cash, and subscriber churn could increase if consumers have fewer dollars to spend on news and entertainment.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
