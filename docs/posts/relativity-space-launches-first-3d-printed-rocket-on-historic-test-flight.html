<p>The world&#39;s first 3D-printed rocket didn&#39;t earn its wings during its launch debut late Wednesday (March 22), but it did notch some important milestones.</p><p>The Relativity Space rocket, <a href="https://www.space.com/relativity-space-company-terran-1-launch">called Terran 1</a>, lifted off from Launch Complex 16 at Florida&#39;s <a href="https://www.space.com/33926-cape-canaveral.html">Cape Canaveral Space Force Station</a> at 8:25 p.m. EST (0025 GMT on March 23), kicking off a test flight called &#34;Good Luck, Have Fun&#34; (GLHF). </p><p>Terran 1 performed well initially. For example, it survived Max-Q — the part of flight during which the structural loads are highest on a rocket — and its first and second stages separated successfully. But something went wrong shortly thereafter, at around three minutes into the flight, when the rocket failed to reach orbit.</p><p>&#34;No one&#39;s ever attempted to launch a 3D-printed rocket into orbit, and, while we didn&#39;t make it all the way today, we gathered enough data to show that flying 3D-printed rockets is viable,&#34; Relativity Space&#39;s Arwa Tizani Kelly said during the company&#39;s launch webcast on Wednesday night.</p><p>&#34;We just completed a major step in proving to the world that <a href="https://www.space.com/relativity-space-company-terran-1-launch">3D-printed rockets</a> are structurally viable,&#34; she added.</p><p><strong>Video: </strong><a href="https://videos.space.com/m/2JfNgfmL/relativity-space-ceo-talks-fully-reusable-3d-printed-rocket?list=9wzCTV4g" data-url="https://videos.space.com/m/2JfNgfmL/relativity-space-ceo-talks-fully-reusable-3d-printed-rocket?list=9wzCTV4g">Relativity Space CEO Tim Ellis on 3d-printed rockets and the future</a></p><div id="slice-container-imageGallery-4"><div data-hydrate="true" data-reactroot=""><div><div><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true"><div><div><div><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="true"><div><div><div data-hydrate="true"><p><img src="https://www.space.com/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="Relativity Space&#39;s first Terran 1 rocket streaks toward space in this long exposure view of its debut test launch from Florida&#39;s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on March 22, 2023.

Rockets rarely perform perfectly on their first-ever liftoff; Japan&#39;s new <a href="https://www.space.com/japan-h3-rocket-fails-1st-test-flight">H3 rocket failed during its debut flight</a> earlier this month, for example. And Relativity Space co-founder Tim Ellis said before launch that getting through Max-Q was &#34;the key inflection&#34; for the GLHF mission.</p><p>&#34;This will essentially prove the viability of using additive manufacturing tech to produce products that fly. We already effectively did this in ground testing, pushing and prodding well above this max stress successfully on both stages in a simulated worst-case flying environment, and have tested over 12,000 seconds of engine hot fires across dozens of articles — so I think we&#39;ve done this already, but in flight of course is the most visceral proof,&#34; <a href="https://twitter.com/thetimellis/status/1633148579995844608" target="_blank" data-url="https://twitter.com/thetimellis/status/1633148579995844608" rel="noopener">Ellis tweeted on March 7</a><span> (opens in new tab)</span>.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="The second stage of Relativity Space&#39;s first Terran 1 rocket comes to life briefly after stage separation during a test launch on March 22, 2023.

Terran 1 is fueled by liquid methane and liquid oxygen, for example, and it tried to become the first such &#34;methalox&#34; rocket to reach orbit (in addition to the first 3D-printed vehicle to do so). </p><p>The methalox combo is favored by <a href="https://www.space.com/47-mars-the-red-planet-fourth-planet-from-the-sun.html">Mars</a> exploration advocates, as both methane and oxygen can be sourced locally on the Red Planet.
