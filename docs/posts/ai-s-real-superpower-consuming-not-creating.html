    <h1>AI&#39;s real superpower: consuming, not creating</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><span>October 30, 2025</span><p>Everyone&#39;s using AI wrong. Including me, until last month.</p>
<p>We ask AI to write emails, generate reports, create content. But that&#39;s like using a supercomputer as a typewriter. The real breakthrough happened when I flipped my entire approach.</p>
<p>AI&#39;s superpower isn&#39;t creation. It&#39;s consumption.</p>
<h2 id="the-creation-trap">The creation trap</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s how most people use AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;Write a blog post about engineering leadership&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Generate code for this feature&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Create a summary of this meeting&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p>Makes sense. These tasks save time. But they&#39;re thinking too small.</p>
<p>My Obsidian vault contains:
→ 3 years of daily engineering notes
→ 500+ meeting reflections
→ Thousands of fleeting observations about building software
→ Every book highlight and conference insight I&#39;ve captured</p>
<p>No human could read all of this in a lifetime. AI consumes it in seconds.</p>
<h2 id="the-consumption-breakthrough">The consumption breakthrough</h2>
<p>Last month I connected my Obsidian vault to AI. The questions changed completely:</p>
<p>Instead of &#34;Write me something new&#34;
I ask &#34;What have I already discovered?&#34;</p>
<p>Real examples from this week:</p>
<p><strong>&#34;What patterns emerge from my last 50 one-on-ones?&#34;</strong>
AI found that performance issues always preceded tool complaints by 2-3 weeks. I&#39;d never connected those dots.</p>
<p><strong>&#34;How has my thinking about technical debt evolved?&#34;</strong>
Turns out I went from seeing it as &#34;things to fix&#34; to &#34;information about system evolution&#34; around March 2023. Forgotten paradigm shift.</p>
<p><strong>&#34;Find connections between Buffer&#39;s API design and my carpeta.app architecture&#34;</strong>
Surfaced 12 design decisions I&#39;m unconsciously repeating. Some good. Some I need to rethink.</p>
<h2 id="your-knowledge-compounds-but-only-if-accessible">Your knowledge compounds, but only if accessible</h2>
<p>Every meeting, every shower thought, every debugging session teaches you something. But that knowledge is worthless if you can&#39;t retrieve it.</p>
<p>Traditional search fails because you need to remember exact words. Your brain fails because it wasn&#39;t designed to store everything.</p>
<p>AI changes the retrieval game:
→ Query by concept, not keywords
→ Find patterns across years, not just documents
→ Connect ideas that were separated by time and context</p>
<p>The constraint was never writing. Humans are already good at creating when they have the right inputs.</p>
<p>The constraint was always consumption. Reading everything. Remembering everything. Connecting everything.</p>
<h2 id="building-your-consumption-system">Building your consumption system</h2>
<p>My setup is deceptively simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everything goes into Obsidian (meetings, thoughts, reflections)</li>
<li>AI has access to the entire vault</li>
<li>I query my past self like a research assistant</li>
</ol>
<p>But the magic isn&#39;t in the tools. It&#39;s in the mindset shift.</p>
<p>Stop thinking of AI as a creator. Start thinking of it as the ultimate reader of your experience.</p>
<p>Every note becomes a future insight. Every reflection becomes searchable wisdom. Every random observation might be the missing piece for tomorrow&#39;s problem.</p>
<h2 id="the-compound-effect">The compound effect</h2>
<p>After two months of this approach:</p>
<p>→ I solve problems faster by finding similar past situations
→ I make better decisions by accessing forgotten context
→ I see patterns that were invisible when scattered across time</p>
<p>Your experience is your competitive advantage. But only if you can access it.</p>
<p>Most people are sitting on goldmines of insight, locked away in notebooks, random files, and fading memories. AI turns that locked vault into a queryable database of your own expertise.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-revolution">The real revolution</h2>
<p>We&#39;re still thinking about AI like it&#39;s 2023. Writing assistants. Code generators. Content creators.</p>
<p>The real revolution is AI as the reader of everything you&#39;ve ever thought.</p>
<p>And that changes everything about how we should capture knowledge today.</p>
<p>Start documenting. Not for others. For your future self and the AI that will help you remember what you&#39;ve forgotten you know.</p>
