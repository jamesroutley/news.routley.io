In 2015, swayed by his youthful charisma and a hopeful political message, voters catapulted the Liberals from a third-place party into a majority - unprecedented in Canadian political history.</p><p>He remains the only leader left standing among peers when he came into office, from Barack Obama to Angela Merkel, Shinzo Abe and David Cameron, and is currently the longest-serving leader in the G7. </p><p>But in the years since, and over two general elections, Trudeau and his brand have become a drag on the party’s fortunes.</p><p>A series of early ethics scandals began to take the sheen off the new government. He was found to have violated federal conflict of interest rules in the handling of a corruption inquiry – the SNC-Lavalin affair - and for luxury trips to the Bahamas.</p><p>In 2020, he faced scrutiny for picking a charity with ties to his family to manage a major government programme.</p><p>More recently, Trudeau faced headwinds over the cost of living and inflation, which have contributed to incumbent election upsets around the world.</p><p>And after more than nine years in power, he is among Canada’s longest serving prime ministers, and there is a general sense of fatigue and frustration with his government.</p><p>In the end, pressure from his own MPs, who over the holidays made it clear they no longer supported his leadership, made staying on near impossible.</p></article></div></div>
