<p>It has been a while since I’ve been working as <strong>SRE/Platform/Cloud Engineer</strong>, and lately and I realize I’ve been repeating some <strong>questions</strong> to developers that I rarely get an answer for straight away.</p>
<p>These are not meant to make anyone’s life harder, <em>au contraire</em>, the whole pourpose of having a solid answer to this list of questions, is to make everyone less worried about the probabilty of some <strong>high stakes, overnight failure</strong> or a <strong>data handling missuse</strong> that could potentially cause big losses, and of course a lot of unnecessary stress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re a Software Engineer/Developer, then consider that a <strong><code>service</code></strong> (at least, for me), is a piece of code running in a <em>live production system</em>, that <strong>YOU</strong> wrote, only <strong>YOU</strong> know how it works, thus <strong>YOU</strong> own.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><strong>List of questions I’d like to get an answer from devs on any new service deployment request:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How can I check the health of the <strong><code>service</code></strong> ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you securely configured endpoints that I can ping periodically?</li>
<li>Is it going to use the same port as the <strong><code>service</code></strong> ?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can I safely and gracefully restart the <strong><code>service</code></strong> ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Does graceful shutdowns wait for <em>inflight requests</em> to finish?</li>
<li>If I restart the <strong><code>service</code></strong>, will there be any disruption or performance degradation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How and why would the <strong><code>service</code></strong> fail ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it has any external dependencies ?</li>
<li>And what happens if it does ?</li>
<li>Do you have a playbook, or sequence of steps, to bring the <strong><code>service</code></strong> back up?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you use appropriate logging levels depending on the environments ? <em>i.e. (TRACE &amp; DEBUG should not go to production)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Are you logging to <code>stdout</code> ?</li>
<li>What format of logs are you using, (JSON, PLAINTEXT)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of metrics are you exposing ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you measuring the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3638693/the-red-method-a-new-strategy-for-monitoring-microservices.html#:~:text=RED%20method%20explained,of%20failed%20requests%20per%20second">RED signals</a>?
<ul>
<li>Rate (# of requests per second)</li>
<li>Errors (# of errors per second) and</li>
<li>Duration (time each request takes)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there any documentation/design specification for the <strong><code>service</code></strong> ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you using gRPC or REST ?</li>
<li>How can I see the API contract?</li>
<li>Do you have a OpenAPI/Swagger spec</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the data flow through the <strong><code>service</code></strong> ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have any <strong>PII/Sensitive</strong> data flowing through the service?</li>
<li>Is any part of the data captured in the <strong><code>service</code></strong> logs?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the testing coverage for this <strong><code>service</code></strong> ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you wrote unit, integration tests for it?</li>
<li>Is there a end to end test that I can run discard issues?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>My <strong>conundrum</strong> lies on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Luckily, much of this overhead can be alleviated with a <strong><code>service</code></strong> template that I can control and upgrade overtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But… that same template can abstract and hide away these answers from devs, causing them to ignore issues and fail to react when their services fail.</p>
</li>
</ul>
