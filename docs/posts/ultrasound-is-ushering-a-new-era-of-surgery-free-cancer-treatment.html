She&#39;d landed on the idea of using high-frequency sound waves – ultrasound – to mechanically break up tissue and was testing her theory on pig hearts.</p><p>Ultrasound isn&#39;t supposed to be audible to human ears, but Xu was using such a powerful amplifier in her experiments that other researchers she shared the laboratory with <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/156/3/1565/3311656/Sensory-unpleasantness-of-very-high-frequency">began to complain about noise</a>. &#34;Nothing had worked anyway,&#34; she says. So she decided to humour her colleagues by increasing the rate of ultrasound pulses, which would bring the sound level outside the range of human hearing.</p><p>To her shock, increasing the number of pulses per second – which also meant each pulse reduced in length to a microsecond – was not only less disruptive to those around her, but also more effective on living tissue than the approach she&#39;d tried previously. As she watched, a hole appeared in the pig heart tissue within a minute of ultrasound application. &#34;I thought I was dreaming,&#34; says Xu, who is today a professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Michigan. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><div><div><p>Decades later, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02656736.2021.1905189">Xu&#39;s serendipitous discovery</a>, known as histotripsy, is one of several approaches using ultrasound that are ushering in a new era of advanced cancer treatment, offering doctors non-invasive methods to rid patients of cancerous tumours using sound rather than surgery.</p><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251010-110820-1cf8d3aa45-web-2.31.3-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0m77rwr.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0m77rwr.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0m77rwr.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0m77rwr.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0m77rwr.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0m77rwr.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0m77rwr.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0m77rwr.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0m77rwr.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0m77rwr.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Erica Bass/ Rogel Cancer Center/ Michigan Medicine Increasing the number of ultrasound pulses produced every second made the device better at destroying living tissue (Credit: Erica Bass/ Rogel Cancer Center/ Michigan Medicine)"/><span>Erica Bass/ Rogel Cancer Center/ Michigan Medicine</span></p><figcaption>Increasing the number of ultrasound pulses produced every second made the device better at destroying living tissue (Credit: Erica Bass/ Rogel Cancer Center/ Michigan Medicine)</figcaption></figure><p>Histotripsy was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-roundup-october-13-2023">treatment of liver tumours</a> in October 2023.

To create a medical image like a sonogram, a handheld transducer sends high-frequency sound waves into the body, where they ricochet off tissues inside. A sensor in the device picks up the waves that bounce back, converting their activity into electrical signals, which are then used to create an image of what&#39;s going on beneath the skin.</p><p>In cancer treatment, ultrasound waves are concentrated onto a small area of a tumour to destroy it.</p><div><p><span>These pulses create tiny microbubbles that expand and then collapse in microseconds, breaking apart the tumour tissue as they do</span></p></div><p>For treatment of liver cancer, histotripsy devices channel ultrasound waves into a focal zone of about two by four millimetres – &#34;basically, the tip of your colouring pen&#34;, Xu says. Then, a robotic arm guides the transducer over the tumour to target the correct area.</p><p>The ultrasound is delivered in quick bursts. These pulses create tiny &#34;microbubbles&#34; that expand and then collapse in microseconds, breaking apart the tumour tissue as they do. The patient&#39;s immune system is then able to clean up the remains. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><div><div><p>The whole thing is fast, non-toxic and non-invasive, usually allowing patients to go home the same day, Xu says.

Some researchers have raised concerns about histotripsy potentially seeding new cancer growths as tumours are broken up inside the body, meaning they can be transported to other areas. That fear, however, hasn&#39;t borne out in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goldjournal.net/article/S0090-4295(12)00672-3/abstract">animal studies</a> so far.</p><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251010-110820-1cf8d3aa45-web-2.31.3-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0m77qxf.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0m77qxf.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0m77qxf.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0m77qxf.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0m77qxf.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0m77qxf.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0m77qxf.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0m77qxf.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0m77qxf.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0m77qxf.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Erica Bass/ Rogel Cancer Center/ Michigan Medicine By adjusting the amount of ultrasound energy produced, the histotripsy device can control how much tissue is affected (Credit: Erica Bass/ Rogel Cancer Center/ Michigan Medicine)"/><span>Erica Bass/ Rogel Cancer Center/ Michigan Medicine</span></p><figcaption>By adjusting the amount of ultrasound energy produced, the histotripsy device can control how much tissue is affected (Credit: Erica Bass/ Rogel Cancer Center/ Michigan Medicine)</figcaption></figure><p>Histotripsy may also not work against all cancers, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02656736.2021.1905189">research suggests</a>. Bone can block ultrasound from reaching its intended source, ruling out tumours in certain locations.

High-intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU), an older and more established technology, can also be used to attack tumours. A focused blast of ultrasound is applied to a tumour to generate heat that essentially &#34;cooks&#34; the tissue, says Richard Price, who co-directs the Focused Ultrasound Cancer Immunotherapy Center at the University of Virginia in the US. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><div><div><p>&#34;If you take a magnifying glass and you hold it outside on a sunny day over a dry leaf, you could actually start the leaf on fire,&#34; Price says.

This barrier usually prevents toxins in the bloodstream from entering and damaging the brain. But purposely opening it during cancer treatment could <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/16/6/719">allow drugs to reach the tumours</a> they&#39;re meant to attack.</p><p>&#34;The non-invasive part is awesome, but the [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168365925007953">drug-delivery</a> component] is really unmatched anywhere,&#34; Price says. </p><p>Deepa Sharma, a research scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Ontario, Canada, says those benefits don&#39;t stop at brain cancer. <a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10555-025-10255-5#Abs1">She has studied</a> the combination of ultrasound and microbubbles across cancer types, finding that it can broadly improve drug delivery.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10517408/%23ab005">Sharma&#39;s research</a> also suggests that ultrasound-enhanced microbubbles can boost the effects of radiation by damaging the vasculature of tumours, leading to greater cell death.

If its effects can be enhanced thanks to ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles, she says, doctors could theoretically use lower doses to achieve the same treatment effects with fewer devastating side effects. </p><p>Ultrasound also seems to be a <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/tb/d3tb02705h/unauth">good match for immunotherapy</a>, a treatment approach focused on spurring the immune system to fight off cancerous cells that may be dodging or hiding from the body&#39;s natural defences.</p><p>As focused ultrasound heats and damages tumours, it seems to make these<a target="_blank" href="https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-abstract/26/5/1152/83120/High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound-HIFU-Triggers?redirectedFrom=fulltext"> tissues more visible to the immune system</a> – and thus more vulnerable to its defences, says Price, whose research centre is focused on using ultrasound along with immunotherapy. </p><p>A direction for future research, Price says, is determining whether that pairing can work against advanced-stage cancer. Metastatic cancer is much harder to treat than localised disease – when cancer spreads throughout the body, it&#39;s no longer enough to remove a single tumour. The holy grail would be that clinicians could someday use ultrasound to coax one tumour out of hiding by breaking it apart, allowing the immune system to pick up on its characteristics and launch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1547594/full">a system-wide attack against cancerous cells</a> elsewhere in the body, Price says.
