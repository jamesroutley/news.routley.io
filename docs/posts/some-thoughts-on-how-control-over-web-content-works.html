    <h1>Some thoughts on how control over web content works</h1>
    
    
<p>
During the lockdown of 2020 and subsequent Twilight Zone times that 
followed, I learned a bit about how a local restaurant&#39;s web site 
operates.  That web site had become the lifeline for the business since 
everything had turned into takeout or delivery, and it wasn&#39;t always 
right, so I brought it up with the owner.  He said he had &#34;a guy who 
takes care of it&#34;.  This makes sense since his thing was running a 
restaurant and keeping that going.  He doesn&#39;t sit around dealing with 
domain names and web sites every day.
</p>
<p>
At one point &#34;his guy&#34; became unreachable for several months, and the 
restaurant owner asked me what his options were since he knew I was &#34;one 
of these computer people&#34;.  I had to lay out the top to bottom of how 
this stuff works in terms of &#34;this content gets displayed with this name 
on it&#34;, and figured it might benefit others if I put some variant of it 
online.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s say you&#39;re the restaurant owner.  You&#39;re paying some third party to 
run a web site and list your menu, hours, and that kind of stuff.  They 
might also have some kind of thing rigged up to send orders through 
online, or an agreement with yet another vendor to do it through them.
</p>
<p>
You need to get something changed on the site.  Maybe your menu changed 
and you need to warn people about the increased price of egg-based 
products.  Maybe you have new hours of operation.  Whatever.  What 
steps can make that happen?
</p>
<p>
In no particular order, an incomplete list:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Ask them to change it&#34; - contact your person (people) and ask them to 
change it.  That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying them for.  You are paying them, 
right?
</p>
<p>
&#34;Change the actual files&#34; - find out how the serving of content works, 
gain access to it, and then make changes to the file(s).  This requires 
account access to whatever they happen to be using to run the site.  If 
it&#39;s just a bunch of flat files on a disk somewhere, it might be easy.  
If it&#39;s just one entry in a much bigger system, it might not.  Also you 
have to know how to do this and/or have new people to do this for you 
(as with most of the entries in this list).
</p>
<p>
&#34;Replace the document root&#34; - figure out how the web server works, then 
swing your-restaurant.example.com around from their directory to your 
directory, or do the equivalent database wrangling if it&#39;s some dynamic 
thing.  This requires some admin powers on the box/system itself.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Take over the server&#34; - gain admin powers on the box through security 
holes or good old-fashioned physical access and single-user mode.  Then 
go in and change the document root, edit the files, or do whatever else 
you feel like doing.  Requires security skills and/or physical access to 
the server.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Replace the server&#34; - find out where the server is (assuming it&#39;s just 
one machine) and then physically replace it with one that you control 
but is otherwise configured for the right IP address(es) and whatever 
else is required to serve the site.  This might mean &#34;unplug the old one 
and plug a new one in on the same spot&#34;.  Requires physical access to 
the hosting arrangements, and if it&#39;s in the clown, yeah, forget about 
it.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Change the DNS&#34; - get access to whatever controls the DNS zone for that 
domain and repoint it to new hosting arrangements with new content 
installed.  This means changing things like A and AAAA records and/or 
CNAMEs.  Requires ability to log in to whatever&#39;s running the show.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Change the primary nameservers&#34; - get into the account at the registrar 
for the domain and repoint the primary nameservers to ones where you can 
set the data for the domain.  Continue as above.  Requires ability to 
log into the registrar account.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Move the domain to another registrar&#34; - maybe you can&#39;t get into the 
existing registrar, but maybe you can go through the transfer process to 
pull it to another one where you can change the nameservers.  Then you 
proceed as in that option (above).  Requires ability to transfer a 
domain, which typically involves a one-time key from the &#34;losing&#34; 
registrar, which in turn usually involves access to the account.  There 
may be legal options for *yoinking* the domain without such access, 
assuming you can prove ownership, or otherwise bludgeon the companies 
involved into doing what you want.
</p>
<p>
Basically, if you actually own some of the items in question, you have 
options.  If you are the owner of the registrar account and it&#39;s just 
some rando tech person who&#39;s a contact on it that does the work, you 
authenticate yourself to the registrar out of band, have them removed, 
get yourself (or a new tech rando) installed, and continue from there.
The same applies for the DNS serving, or the actual web hosting.
</p>
<p>
This pattern pretty much plays out everywhere: is it your account?  Or, 
did you pay them to &#34;take care of everything&#34; and your only &#34;interface&#34; 
to it is through them?
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think people really know the implications of some of these 
setups.
