    <h1>The journey of the Roman gladius and other swords</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This week I want to do something a little different and discuss the evolution and development of a specific weapon, in this case the famed Roman <em>gladius</em>, the sword of the legions. As we’re going to see, this is going to entail a <em>journey</em> covering quite a bit of both time and space as the <em>gladius</em> first emerges from other sword forms, then evolves through its own subtypes and eventually into what we’d recognize as other, later sword forms.</p>



<p>And while this is a fun way to explore the development of a single weapon-type, I want to actually use this to make a few broader points. First, in the same way we discussed with the Mediterranean omni-spear, weapons develop in response to their threat-environment: on the one hand their shapes shift and mold towards the current threats, but on the other hand this is almost always a slow, evolutionary process of change rather than some sort of sudden ‘snap’ to an optimal design. Second, I want to also stress the substantial cultural exchange – in this case, often violent – implied by the twisting, turning journey of the <em>gladius</em> and the larger La Tène sword family. While we often represent weapon-types as distinctive to particular cultures – and to be fair, they often are! – but they are also often crossing cultural or political boundaries, influencing each other or splitting into distinct but related designs. Effective designs, in particular, prompt a lot of imitation.</p>



<p><strong>And the <em>gladius</em> was <em>very</em> effective.</strong></p>

<p>(Bibliography Note: The starting point for any kind of Roman military equipment is, unsurprisingly, M.C. Bishop and J.C.N. Coulston, <a href="https://amzn.to/3aiXaBg"><em>Roman Military Equipment from the Punic Wars to the Fall of Rome</em></a> (2006), now in its second edition with a third edition on the way. I have used here, made available by the authors via creative commons licensing, several of the wonderful scale-drawing reproductions in that volume. On the La Tène sword, the <em>best</em> thing to read is T. Lejars, <em>La Tène: La Collection Schwab (Bienne, Suisse).  La Tène, Un Site, Un Mythe 3</em>. (2013) but it is practically impossible to acquire in the United States. For English-readers, R. Pleiner, <em>The Celtic Sword</em> (1993) and J.M. De Navarro, <em>The Finds from the Site of La Tène: Scabbards and the Swords Found in Them</em> (1972) are both excellent surveys of the weapons. For La Tène swords in Spain and all other pre-Roman swords in Spain, Quesada Sanz, <em>El Armamento Ibérico. Estudio tipológico, geográfico, functional, social y simbólico de las armas en la Cultura ibérica (siglos VI-I a.C.)</em> (1997) is the place to go, but for something a bit more beginner-friendly F. Quesada Sanz, <em>Arma de la antigua Iberia: De Tartesos a Numancia</em> (2010) is excellent and well-illustrated, <a href="https://amzn.to/3RMTOvl" data-type="link" data-id="https://amzn.to/3RMTOvl">an English translation has <em>just</em> become available</a> and is due for a fireside recommendation as soon as my copy actually arrives.</p>



<h2>La Tène Beginnings</h2>



<p>We start not in Italy at all, but in what is today France, in particular the region north of the Swiss Alps (so eastern France), which is where we find what seem to be the oldest La Tène material culture sites. La Tène material culture was itself a development out of the older Hallstatt material culture and so La Tène swords (exclusively made in iron) likely have their roots in earlier Hallstatt swords (generally made in bronze), though the shift in metal brings with it a shift in design (especially in the tang) that is significant enough to treat these as distinct sword-types.</p>



<p>Early iron La Tène swords already start showing some of the key design features that are going to define their long lineage (into which fits <em>most</em> of the European sword tradition). In particular, the base of the blade narrows to a thin, typically rectangular cross-sectioned tang, which runs through the hilt completely enclosed (rather than a flat tang like you may see on modern steak knives); the guard, handle and pommel, made out of organic materials (usually wood) are slide over that tang and then the tang is hammered down to make a ‘disc-button’ that presses the organic hilt elements together. That is by no means the only way to structure the handle of a sword – the other major options are to either make much of the grip out of metal (one sees this with many Indians swords) or to have a ‘flat’ tang of metal shaped in the flat silhouette of the grip, which is then sandwiched by organic elements and riveted through. So what I am going to call the ‘square-tang’ (short for square-sectioned-tang), while I can’t say it is <em>exclusive</em> to the greater La Tène sword family, is a notable marker of it.</p>



<p>Early La Tène swords (from around 500 – 300 BC; you’ll see these described as La Tène I swords) tend to be fairly short, with blade-lengths in the 50-65cm range (though some are longer than this) and they tend to come to quite sharp thrusting points. Note that I am going to give <em>blade-lengths</em> for various swords, but of course the total length will include the hilt, which is generally going to add 14-16cm to the total length (human hands varying only somewhat in size). The edges of the blade typically taper (that is, the blade begins to narrow) fairly early along the blade’s length compared to later La Tène swords – this would be in contrast to a sword with parallel edges for much of its length. Some swords of this kind come to disc-button pommels, but others have elaborate ‘antenna’ pommels, a stylistic element one sees in earlier Hallstatt swords, as well as swords in Spain and Italy, which drops away fairly quickly among La Tène swords.</p>

ML.1732) an early early La Tène (La Tène I) sword, found at Bussy-le-Château in France. It has a 64cm long blade 5.1cm at its widest point, a bit on the big size for the type. Note the sharp point the sword comes to.</figcaption></figure>



<p>And from this starting point, things now diverge because the early La Tène sword spreads geographically (by adoption, it seems, as much if not more than by migration; in many cases it is spreading to other linguistically and culturally distinctive groups who know a good thing when they see it) and as a result develops differently in different geographic spaces. In the La Tène ‘heartland’ of Gaul and the Danube region, it gets progressively longer and the edges become more parallel, producing the Middle La Tène sword (La Tène II sword) of the third and second century, with a blade length of 60-75cm (so a total length of 75-90cm). Because the edges more parallel, the taper is not so strong and so the point is less sharp; most Middle La Tène swords still have capable thrusting points, but some of them are starting to be rounded. What I suspect is happening is that as the metallurgy available to La Tène smiths improves – and they are experimenting with steel in full swing at this point – they are taking advantage of the superior capabilities to produce longer cutting blades (because they have stronger metal to play with, so they can get more length without compromising on weight or reliability). That greater length, combined with a combat environment where body armor is rare, encourages a cutting-oriented fighting style and the blades shift to match, favoring the cut over the thrust in their design.</p>

<p>In <strong>Italy</strong>, the early La Tène sword makes it into Cisalpine Gaul and from there into much of Italy. As Michael Taylor notes there’s good reason to suppose La Tène swords push out the Greek-style swords (both straight <em>xiphe</em> and curved <em>kopides</em>) which predominate the fifth-century burial evidence. A recovered fourth century sword-blade in La Tène style actually has an inscription, “TR POMPONIOS C [F?] [M]E FECET ROMA[I],” ‘Trebonius Pomponoius, Son of Gaius, made me in Rome,’ suggesting Roman smiths are already making swords in the fourth century in La Tène style. That also probably explains why the Romans shift from the native Latin word for sword (<em>ensis</em>, which gets used subsequently mostly in poetry) to a Proto-Celtic loanword for sword (the familiar <em>gladius</em>) to refer to these swords and then eventually all swords. This is a clear case of the La Tène style of sword crossing cultural boundaries – Romans are not Gauls – a thing that it turns out this sword-type will be very good at.</p>



<p>Meanwhile in <strong>Spain</strong> the early La Tène swords enter in the fourth century into a <em>bewildering</em> variety of sword-types in use on the Iberian peninsula. ’True’ La Tène swords remain rare – the longer “Middle’ La Tène types especially so – but smiths in the Celtiberian region of the Meseta take up the early La Tène sword and make it their own. Remaining around 55-65cm in blade length, local producers adapted the sword to the local suspension system (that is, the way the scabbard is held on the body) with a two-point ring suspension over the single-point chain suspension of La Tène swords; this is the suspension we in turn see in early Roman <em>gladii</em>. There’s also some cross-pollination, it seems with the indigenous Celtiberian ‘Antenna’ swords, which offer a bit of their blade-shape to this emerging type, perhaps contributing the later <em>gladius</em>‘ lightly slightly ‘waisted’ profile. The tang-structure, however, remains distinctively La Tène with a square-sectioned tang rather than the Antenna swords’ full metal handle.</p>

<p>So by the mid-third century (that is, the 250s) we have three successors of the early La Tène sword: in the La Tène material culture sphere itself (Gaul, the Danube basin, the Alps) we mostly have ‘Middle’ La Tène swords (longer, parallel-edged, rounded points), while in Italy we have (alongside some Greek sword-types still holding on for the moment) apparently locally adopted but mostly unmodified early La Tène sword-types presumably being used by the armies of Rome, while in Celtiberian Spain we have a modified form of the early La Tène sword with a different suspension and a modestly different blade-shape.</p>



<p>And then the Romans find this Spanish variant of the La Tène sword. We don’t <em>know</em> when the Romans adopt the ‘Spanish sword’ (what <em>gladius Hispaniensis</em> means), except that they’ve clearly done so by the second century. The <em>Suda</em> puts it in the Second Punic War and while that is a weak reed source-wise, it makes a lot of sense, since Roman armies are operating in Spain continuously from 218. Consequently, scholars generally posit the Roman adoption of this weapon in the late third-century, essentially trading their own variant of the early La Tène sword for the Celtiberian one, probably as a consequence of Roman fighting in Spain. It is <em>that</em> sword which in turn becomes the famed <em>gladius Hispaniensis</em>, the distinctive ‘national’ sword of Rome and the standard weapon of the legions.</p>



<h2><em>Gladius Hispaniensis</em> and Other Swords</h2>



<p>The earliest examples of the <em>gladius Hispaniensis</em> that we have in clearly Roman contexts are two early second-century swords from Grad near Šmihel, Slovenia and they are neat examples of the type. The blades are 62.2 and 66cm, which is to say at the longer end of the range for their Iberian forebears, but that will be typical for the type as the blade-lengths for the <em>gladius Hispaniensis</em> range from 60-70cm (with one outlier at 77.3cm) and they show a very slight ‘waisting’ – that is they narrow slightly from the ‘shoulders’ (where the blade meets the hilt) to about one third of the way ‘up’ the blade (to the point) before broadening out to a maximum width about two-thirds of the way up, then narrowing to a point. I don’t want to overstress this point, the ‘waist’ on these swords is quite mild, with the width at the thickest point (generally being around 4-5cm across) being within a centimeter of the width at the thinnest point (not counting the tip, of course).</p>

C. Bishop</figcaption></figure>



<p>The tang structure of these swords is uniformly the La Tène square-sectioned tang style, though we know from artwork and later versions that the organic elements of the hilt have changed. Whereas La Tène swords often have a very small metal guard fitted on the shoulders of the blade (which in turn are sloped to accommodate this piece), the <em>gladius</em> lacks this element, instead featuring a wooden guard and grip, along with a generally more spherical wooden pommel. Combined with the change in suspension, the result is a sword that is clearly in the extended La Tène sword <em>family</em>, but is not itself a La Tène sword.</p>



<p>It also seems like at least at this point (if not earlier) the Romans have started experimenting with steel. One of the two Šmihel <em>gladii</em> was metallurgical tested and while it certainly isn’t <em>good</em> steel (the blade seems to have been decarburized, possibly carelessly during smithing but also potentially by the passage of time after deposition), there is meaningful carbon content, around 0.3% in the center of the blade. With a single example, its hard to say if this sort of quality was typical for early second century Roman <em>gladii</em> (later imperial-period swords show much higher quality, as do some La Tène swords, though in both cases, variance is high), but it is enough to show that the Romans are at least working with mild steel for their swords at this point.</p>



<p>What our sources absolutely agree about it was that it was a <em>really</em> effective and versatile weapon (e.g. Polyb. 3.114.1, 6.23.7, 15.15.8, Livy 31.34.4) able to cut and thrust well. That fact sometimes surprises folks more used to the more thrust-oriented imperial-period Roman <em>gladius</em> and its fighting style, but the weapon of the Middle and Late Republic was a versatile cut-and-thrust sword, rather than primarily-thrust-oriented weapon, though even those later <em>gladii</em> retain a lot of the design’s flexibility. These are also <em><strong>not short swords</strong></em> as they are far too often described. With a typical length of around 75-85cm, they’re only about 10% shorter than a typical medieval arming sword (they tend to be c. 90cm total length). The very modest residual waisting suggests a continued concern for power in the cut, as I think does the somewhat<a href="https://twitter.com/DrMichaelJTayl1/status/1732771849795260557" data-type="link" data-id="https://twitter.com/DrMichaelJTayl1/status/1732771849795260557"> different combat stance Romans have in this period as compared to the thrust-oriented imperial period</a>.</p>



<p>And of course that makes the sword <em>really quite good</em> for the Roman style of relatively-open order combat against a very wide range of opponents. A Roman needs a bit of space to wield this sword, but they have that space. At the same time, it allows for devastating cuts against unarmored opponents, but also dangerous and effective thrusts against more heavily armored opponents (either trying to split the rings of mail or strike exposed areas like necks and faces). Given how widely the Romans were fighting and that this was the <em>only</em> contact weapon the Roman heavy infantryman carried, the versatility must have been a major asset. Unlike dedicating cutting weapons (the <em>kopis</em> comes to mind) which would be at a profound disadvantage against a mailed opponent, the <em>gladius Hispaniensis</em> would work tolerably well under basically all conditions: armored, unarmored, close-press, open-order, skirmishing, formation fighting.</p>



<p>And then, of course, the Romans take this sword <em>everywhere</em>. We find Roman <em>gladii</em> from the Republic deposited in North Africa, France, in Greece (on Delos, no less), in Egypt (though the identification of this as a <em>Hispaniensis</em> is contested), in Cisalpine Gaul and of course in the Balkans as mentioned above. <strong>But they aren’t <em>only</em> carrying the <em>gladius Hispaniensis</em></strong>.</p>



<p>Instead, its striking that in this period we also find what are clearly La Tène swords – not <em>gladii</em> – in Roman contexts too. The aformentioned Šmihel <em>gladii</em> were found with a La Tène sword, 79cm long with a gradual taper and a double-fuller, along with bell-shaped guard, a middle La Tène design. Meanwhile, fragments of at a least one La Tène sword, probably also a middle-type, were found in the second century Roman siege camps at Numantia. Now those <em>could</em> be loot (<em>spolia</em>, in technical parlance) or odd outliers, but given that the Romans were also using (early) La Tène swords before, it doesn’t seem entirely wild to suppose that they were still using some small number of (now middle) La Tène swords in the second century, especially because, as we’re going to see, that sword-type doesn’t fade away into oblivion.</p>



<p>What <em>do</em> fade are a lot of the <em>other</em> Mediterranean sword traditions: <strong>the expansion of Roman power leads to a sort of ‘mass extinction event’ for <em>militaria</em> in the Mediterranean</strong>. While a lot of styles of equipment end up incorporated into the Roman army one way or another (<em>especially</em> La Tène <em>militaria</em>), what doesn’t get drawn into the Roman <em>militaria</em>-stew often fades away: Greek-style tube-and-yoke cuirasses, Italic pectoral-cuirasses, the <em>soliferreum</em>, the <em>sarissa</em>, the Greek sword tradition (<em>xiphos</em> and <em>kopis</em>), quite a lot of Greek and Hellenistic helmet types (though others, like the muscle cuirass, survive as high-status officer’s armor for a time). Now I don’t want to overstate the impact here: there’s a whole world outside of the Roman Empire and other sword traditions live on there. But <em>within</em> Rome’s armies, the two principle swords end up being the La Tène sword and the <em>gladius Hispaniensis</em>…which was also a La Tène sword, of sorts.</p>



<p>Which leads us to:</p>



<h2>Swords of the Empire</h2>



<p>The Imperial period! Which, as a scholar of the Middle Republic, I am inclined to insist is just the funny post-credits ‘sting’ of Roman history.</p>



<p>The <em>gladius</em> does not stay static, however. By the early first century AD running to roughly mid-century, we see a fairly marked change in its design with the emergence of the ‘Mainz’ type, named after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainz_Gladius" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainz_Gladius">Mainz Gladius</a> (British Museum 1866,0806.1). The blade has becoming meaningfully shorter, with blade-lengths of 40-55cm; they’ve also become quite a bit <em>wider</em>, with maximum widths of 5.5-7.5cm as compared to the normal width of the <em>Hispaniensis</em> around 4-5cm. These blades are still often waisted, but obviously they’re shorter and stouter, coming to well-defined and sharp tips: still <em>capable</em> of delivering effective cuts, these are now clearly primarily thrusting weapons. By the Flavian Period (69-96AD) these give way to the Pompeii type, which features parallel edges (rather than waisted ones or a particularly long taper) and even shorter blades, generally 42-50cm, though also somewhat narrower widths (4.2-5.5cm); these swords persist through the Antonines at least.</p>

<p>Now that is an interesting design change: this weapon is becoming wider and <em>dramatically</em> shorter, dropping from blade-lengths around 60-70cm to lengths around 40-50cm. And while I argued that the steady lengthening of earlier La Tène swords might have been a consequence of improving metallurgy, the reverse is not happening here: the <em>gladius </em>is getting shorter <em>as Roman metallurgy continues to improve</em>. So there is no <em>structural</em> reason that the <em>gladius Hispaniensis</em> had to get shorter to make for the Mainz- and Pompeii-types. And yet it does, why?</p>

<p>I think the answer here is “threat environment.” Roman armies of the third and especially second century BC are facing a <em>wide</em> array of mostly external threats. That includes relatively well-armored (less well than the Romans, but relatively well) opponents like Greeks and Macedonians (and probably Carthaginians) but also much less-well armored opponents like Gauls, Iberians, Celtiberians and so on. The <em>Hispaniensis</em> is ideal for the purpose: reasonably long (with a reach advantage over equivalent Greek swords), able to cut and thrust equally well (but excelling at neither), it is <em>versatile</em> for a varied threat environment.</p>



<p>But starting in the first century BC and continuing into the first century AD the threat environment for a Roman legionary soldier starts to become a lot less varied: <strong>by this point, the primary threat to a Roman legionary is <em>another</em> Roman legionary</strong>. Rome, after all, has defeated all of its peer rivals, but the first century BC is full of civil wars (and the first century AD will add one more big one in 69AD); the barbarians on the frontier may not often defeat Roman legions in pitched battles, <em>but Roman legions do</em>. And – as we’ll no doubt discuss here in more depth at some point soon – one thing about the Roman soldier that makes him stand out is <strong>that the Roman soldier is uncommonly heavily armored</strong> by the standards of antiquity. In particular, by the first century BC, the <em>standard</em> armor of the Roman legions was the <em>lorica hamata</em>, a mail shirt extending down to just short of the knees. That kind of armor offers <em>excellent</em> coverage (its flexibility means it can cover the upper legs and groin just fine) and no amount of force a human can apply will allow any iron or steel sword ever made to <em>cut</em> the rings of such an armor.</p>

<p><em>I think</em> – though this is a point we cannot <em>know</em> – that the imperial-period <em>gladii</em> are a direct response to this problem. A shorter weapon allows for greater control of the tip for thrusting, while the stouter construction may make for a stiffer blade that transfers more energy to the point of impact (instead of bending) in order to hopefully split those rings and penetrate to the body underneath. At the same time, a shorter sword is also going to be handier for trying to get in close and strike at the spots <em>not</em> protected by mail, particularly the face and neck. It is also possible that Roman tactics are shifting in this period; Michael Taylor has noted a change in the positioning of Roman swords in artwork suggesting a different guard and its striking that at least much later Roman sources (like Vegetius) imagine a lot closer spacing than the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/12/15/collections-shield-walls-and-spacing-hollywood-mobs-and-ancient-tactics/" data-type="post" data-id="21886">fairly wide intervals of the legion of the Middle Republic</a>. <strong>So I think that what is happening is that the <em>gladius</em> is transforming from a versatile cut-and-thrust weapon to a dedicated Roman-killer designed to be effective against a mailed opponent</strong>, though we must stress that even this shorter design is still quite capable of delivering strong cuts.</p>



<p><strong>But deep in the heart of France, <em>another sword was made</em></strong>. The broader La Tène cultural sphere in France and on the Danube remains independent of Roman control until the mid-first century BC and so its swords keep developing. The Middle La Tène sword of the third and second century continues to get <em>longer</em>, around 75-90cm in total length leading to the Late La Tène sword. The cut is more and more emphasized, with many swords having rounded tips which wouldn’t have been entirely <em>useless</em> in the thrust but would hardly be ideal for it; those tips however let the blade edges run parallel to each other for nearly the entire length, giving a nice, wide cutting surface. These are not ‘long swords’ – they’re still dedicated one-handed swords – but they are clearly <em>cut</em>-oriented swords.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that what is happening is two-fold: on the one hand,  La Tène material culture peoples mostly fight <em>each other</em> and we know that metal body protection in the La Tène material culture sphere was relatively rare. Consequently a sword with a powerful cut that could cut through a textile defense to quickly disable the man beneath (cutting wounds are far more rapidly disabling than thrusting weapons) was thus better in that context. A longer sword creates a longer lever and thus more power in the cut and the extra reach hardly hurts either! At the same time, Gallic metallurgy is getting <em>really quite good</em> (at least for antiquity) in this period, so La Tène smiths working with high quality metals for the best, most expensive swords can safely make these swords <em>longer</em> without making them <em>heavier</em>, producing a superior product.  Of course cheaper swords made of worse iron in the same pattern will be less reliable, but one can easily see how the elite products push sword-length <em>generally</em> longer.</p>



<p>In any case, those La Tène swords loop <em>back</em> into the Roman sphere in the form of what the Romans called the <em>spatha</em> (borrowed from the Greek σπάθη). <em>Spatha</em> is a ‘shape’ word, refering to something broad, flat and long (‘spatula shaped’) and we generally suppose these to have been derived from the longer La Tène swords. Early imperial <em>spathae</em> are relatively rare, but a few examples survive and tend to be quite long (c. 75-95cm) and one wonders if they actually derive from late La Tène swords or from <em>middle</em> La Tène swords persisting as cavalry swords in Roman armies. In design, they have parallel blades, but generally triangular, rather than rounded points, and often feature some kind of central groove or fuller, presumably to control the final weight of the weapon. The normal assumption is that these were, at least initially, cavalry weapons – the greater length enabling downward strikes from horseback – but especially after the Antonine periods (post-192 AD), the sword starts creeping into contexts that suggest it is being used by the infantry as well.</p>

<p>As we get into the third century, Roman swords continue to shift; this is sometimes represented as the end of the <em>gladius</em>, dropped now in favor of the <em>spatha</em>, but I’m not so sure of that. We get two rough groupings, a longer and narrower “Straubing/Nydam” type around 65-80cm of blade-length and a shorter, thicker “Lauriacum/Hromowka” type (55.7-65.5cm blade length). It is the case that a lot of the swords have the double-fuller and parallel edges common on earlier <em>spathae</em> as well as pattern-welding techniques not generally seen on <em>gladii</em>, but it seems to me we might be able to understand the shorter swords of this period as perhaps reflecting a merger of traditions: taking the production process and structure of the <em>spatha</em> and welding it, as it were, to a sword on the rough dimensions of an imperial-period <em>gladius</em>.</p>

<p>It is this ‘merged’ (in my mind, at least) style which continues into the late imperial period, with relatively long swords with blade lengths around 70-80cm, around 5cm thick, with the standard markers of their La Tène heritage: straight-blades with parallel edges and square-sectioned tangs. And by this point (the third and fourth century) those Roman <em>spathae</em> are not radically different in size, weight or function from the ‘barbarian’ swords in use of the frontier in the Rhine or the Danube; indeed it is very clear that these sword designs are moving freely <em>in both directions</em> over the Roman frontier, as they always have been. That convergence in turn leads to what we sometimes term simply the ‘Migration period sword,’ the ‘migration period’ being a term sometimes used for the fifth through eighth centuries (though I think this periodization does some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question">question-beggging</a>, given that we now suppose the actual scale of human migration in this period was not as large as was once thought).</p>

Image © M. C. Bishop</figcaption></figure>



<p>Why the shift <strong>now</strong> back to a longer sword with long parallel cutting edges? Well, to me at least, the solution that suggests itself is that once again the threat environment has shifted. For the first two centuries AD, the main threat to a heavily armored Roman legion was another heavily armored Roman legion in some sort of civil war. But as we get into the third century and beyond both the amount of armor in Roman armies may be declining (it certainly seems to be by the fourth century; the <em>best</em> troops remain as well-armored as ever, but become scarcer) and increasingly less heavily armored external threats (Germanic peoples, Sassanids and later Huns) begin to dominate over facing off against other Roman heavy infantry armies. Fortunately for the Roman soldier, there is already a good sword available that is highly effective against less well-armored enemies and still quite versatile: the <em>spatha</em> which you will note in the third century the longer form (the Straubing/Nydam-type) approximates the measurements of the <em>gladius Hispaniensis</em>, though it owes its shape much more to later La Tène swords.</p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>As noted, those late Roman swords, with their La Tène ‘DNA,’ as it were, provide the most influential foundation point for the European sword tradition that follows, with nearly all European swords – even later curved swords – functioning with the same square-sectioned tang construction, as opposed to the ‘flat tang’ construction more common on the Eurasian Steppe and in the Middle East.</p>



<p>That said, what I want to draw out here most clearly are what I see as the two principle factors for the development of that tradition: the way that weapons <em>respond</em> to their perceived threat-environment, adapting to deal with changing problems and the fascinating way that weapon designs cross cultural boundaries.</p>



<p>On the one hand, the La Tène sword, developing out of older bronze swords and limited by early iron metallurgy, starts fairly short. But in the La Tène material cultural sphere, it steadily lengthens, because that makes it more effective against the kind of threat La Tène material culture warriors faced, which were for the most part <em>other</em> warriors with La Tène material culture, which is to say generally very little armor. By contrast the Romans, taking a local Spanish variant of this tradition, begin to shorten it as their threat environment shifts more and more heavily towards peer combatants wearing lots of mail armor. When that stops being the main threat, they drop that shorter version of the <em>gladius</em>, and shift to a longer sword, which just happens to be another branch of the larger La Tène sword family tree.</p>



<p>At the same time, the cultural boundaries for these weapons are incredibly porous! The La Tène sword goes to Spain, becomes a local La Tène variant that is quite distinctive, before traveling to Italy to become the <em>gladius Hispaniensis</em>, which then ripples outward across the Mediterranean. And if I’m right, in that process it eventually picks up the Middle/Late La Tène sword as a companion (the <em>spatha</em>) and then eventually ends up as a single merged sword tradition, which is at the same time both crossing over the Roman frontier (the <em>limes</em>) cross-pollinating with and merging with ‘barbarian’ sword traditions there. We often think of ‘this’ weapon belonging to ‘this’ culture – and weapons do often have strong cultural connections – but they also influence each other across cultural lines, sharing design elements or being adopted by other peoples.</p>



<p>As, indeed, do nearly <em>all</em> of the elements of culture, though such borrowing is often most visible in material culture objects which survive to us archaeologically. <strong>Cultures in the past – like cultures in the present – are not neatly defined, unchanging mutually exclusive things the way that they appear, for instance, in many video games, but rather amorphous, shifting and overlapping creatures</strong>. As true for swords as for anything else!</p>
