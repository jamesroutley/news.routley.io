      <p>Since I’m a very “optimizer and minimalist user” I check for the waste of space in my <em>tiny</em> SSD. For three reasons: Apple’s storage prices are terribly high, the fuller a SSD is, the less it will last, why keep useless files? It’s a waste.</p>

<p>Indeed my main storage drive is a 256GB drive, and all my system takes about 60-80GB (depending on the cache and apps)</p>

<p><img src="https://giuliomagnifico.blog/_images/2022/macos-cache-wallpaper/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-25%20at%2009.01.14.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-09-25 at 09.01.14"/></p>

<p>So I discovered a weird folder inside my Home directory: 2.66GB for a photos/wallpapers folder. Why? I have no idea, it’s just one of the (many) folders that macOS keeps forever without any reason.</p>

<p>I’ve investigated into this folder and I discovered that is a stupid cache folder that keeps all your wallpapers that you set from Apple Photos app:</p>

<a href="https://giuliomagnifico.blog/_images/2022/macos-cache-wallpaper/sizing.png" target="\_blank">Full size</a></p>

<p>A totally useless cache folder that macOS don’t delete after “x” time. Just consider that every image inside takes about 5-10MB, so in order to reach almost 3GB it takes a long time. macOS has never cleared it during these 3-4 years.</p>

<p>The folder path is:
<code>Macintosh SSD &gt; Users &gt; [yourHome] &gt; Library &gt; Containers &gt; Photos &gt; Data &gt; Library &gt; Application Support &gt; Photos Desktop</code></p>

<p>And is safe to delete all the subfolders inside. PSA: You will have to set again the wallpapers of your “Desktop 2/3/4…” because this folder is where macOS keeps the cache of them, but don’t set again the wallpaper from Photos.</p>

<p>Instead, to avoid this pointless behavior of macOS, set the wallpaper from the macOS System Preferences and not from Photos:</p>

Wrong way:

<p>P.S. in order to be more specific, this folder is not exactly a cache folder, due to Sandboxing of macOS this folder is where macOS stores a copy (it creates a new file) in oder to be used as a wallpaper from the other macOS resources/wallpaper engine.</p>

<p>Explained: if you set <em>car.jpg</em> as a wallpaper today, you change it tomorrow with <em>house.jpg</em> and you will set again <em>car.jpg</em> after “x” time (few days), then macOS will not use again the file created inside this folder with <em>car.jpg</em> but it will create a new folder with the same wallpaper. This is why it grows uncontrollably.</p>

<p>Tip: if you want to read the comment and find some interesting solution to check/manage your disk space, you can read <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32980737" target="\_blank">the comments</a> about this post on Hacker News, there’re many interesting comments</p>

<p>And if you want, report in a comment the size of this cache folder for you. Just out of curiosity and to make some stats.</p>
