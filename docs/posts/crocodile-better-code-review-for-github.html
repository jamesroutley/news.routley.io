    <h1>Show HN: Crocodile - Better code review for GitHub</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p><img src="https://www.crocodile.dev/images/comment-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot focusing on commenting features."/></p><div><h2>Comments as they should be</h2><div><p>Crocodile doesn&#39;t limit you to commenting on lines that have changed. You can comment <em>anywhere</em> in the file and on <em>any text selection</em>, even if it&#39;s just one character.</p><p>Once you&#39;ve made a comment, it goes in a draggable window that floats above the code. Other tools put comments inline, which breaks up the flow of code and makes it painful to review. Floating comments that you can reposition and hide help you <em>stay focused</em>.</p><p>Comments are <em>never lost</em> even if you change the code that was commented on. As new code gets pushed, Crocodile transfers comments across iterations so you never lose track of a coversation and everything gets resolved.</p></div></div></div></section><section><h2>See the difference: <span>diff GitHub Crocodile</span></h2><table><thead><tr><td><div><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5 10a1 1 0 011-1h8a1 1 0 110 2H6a1 1 0 01-1-1z" clip-rule="evenodd"></path></svg><p>GitHub</p></div></td><td><div><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M10 5a1 1 0 011 1v3h3a1 1 0 110 2h-3v3a1 1 0 11-2 0v-3H6a1 1 0 110-2h3V6a1 1 0 011-1z" clip-rule="evenodd"></path></svg><p>Crocodile</p></div></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Comments get outdated after code changes, force pushes, and rebases, which leads to lost and unresolved comments.</td><td>Comments are never outdated or lost and get mapped across changes, force pushes, and rebases until they are marked as closed so that every issue is resolved.</td></tr><tr><td>Comments can only be made on whole lines, which makes it hard to point out specific issues, and they can only be made on or near lines that have changed.</td><td>Comments can be made on any selection of text anywhere in the file, even single characters, so it&#39;s always clear where the issue is.</td></tr><tr><td>Comments are displayed inline with the code, which makes it hard to review when there are long discussions.</td><td>Comments float above the code and can be repositioned so they never break the flow of code.</td></tr><tr><td>Noisy notifications for every comment cause people to ignore them, which leads to long review times.</td><td>Useful notifications that let you know it is your turn to act on a review.</td></tr><tr><td>Complicated UI for diffing iterations.
