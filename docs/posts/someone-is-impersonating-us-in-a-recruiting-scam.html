<p>My startup was recently the center of an elaborate recruiting scam. If you&#39;ve recently gotten a gmail address and a &#34;Senior Recruiter&#34; Fathi Saeed, please know that this is <strong>not</strong> legitimate outreach.</p><p>In this article, I wanted to share what the experience was so that other targets know it‚Äôs a scam and so that other entrepreneurs know what these scams look like for the future.</p><h2 id="what-happened-this-time-around">What Happened This Time Around</h2><p>I run a 40 person company called Kapwing based in San Francisco. Currently, the only role we‚Äôre actively hiring for is our <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/kapwing/8dedc407-201e-4c6d-a21c-8161083cc210">Software Engineering Manager</a>. However, we were notified by more than 30 people in the last week that someone is impersonating me (the CEO) to offer a video editing job that pays $90/hour.</p><p>This recruiting scam targeted people who are video editors. Video editors are also Kapwing users, so it breaks my heart that our potential customers could get burned by this scam ¬†üíî.</p><h3 id="step-1-outreach">Step 1: Outreach</h3><p>The scam starts with a fake email impersonating me, the CEO. The job seeker is told that they&#39;ve been &#34;shortlisted for a virtual screening/interview.&#34; The initial email comes from <strong><a href="https://www.kapwing.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#462d2736312f2821682c29243534232534332f3206212b272f2a6825292b"><span data-cfemail="284349585f41464f0642474a5b5a4d4b5a5d415c684f45494144064b4745">[email¬†protected]</span></a></strong> and is signed with my name. It often has no subject.</p><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-13-at-8.36.36-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="886" height="256" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-13-at-8.36.36-AM.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-13-at-8.36.36-AM.png 886w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Sometimes, the person submitted an application on a job board. </p><h3 id="phase-2-written-interview">Phase 2: Written Interview</h3><p>If the candidate is interested, they‚Äôre supposed to reach out to a different gmail address, <a href="https://www.kapwing.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8aeb1abadb9b4abbbaabdbdb6b1b6bfacbda0ac98bfb5b9b1b4f6bbb7b5"><span data-cfemail="82f4ebf1f7e3eef1e1f0e7e7ecebece5f6e7faf6c2e5efe3ebeeace1edef">[email¬†protected]</span></a>, to schedule an interview with a supposed senior recruiter, Fathi Saeed. Once they reach out, they‚Äôll get a Google Doc with a 20-question interview asking about their experience and background.</p><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-13-at-7.25.49-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1498" height="882" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-13-at-7.25.49-AM.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-13-at-7.25.49-AM.png 1000w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-13-at-7.25.49-AM.png 1498w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>The job interview</figcaption></figure><p>One of the people who received this Google Doc shared it with me.

Any job seeker wondering about a correspondence should question outreach that has these qualities:</p><ol><li><strong>The emails come from a gmail address</strong>, not the company domain. All Kapwing employees have a @kapwing.com email, so job candidates would not get outreach from us from a gmail address. And you can always find the people who work at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/18650774/">Kapwing on LinkedIn</a>.</li><li><strong>Asking for money</strong> or unnecessary personal info before you‚Äôve signed a contract. We would never ask a candidate to send us bank info over email; we only ask for direct deposit information through our secure HR system (Gusto) after a candidate signs an official job offer. </li><li><strong>No open job posting</strong>: Check to see if a job posting is open on the <a href="https://www.kapwing.com/careers">company‚Äôs job page</a> (with an HTTPS in the header). If not, it may be a scam. When we do recruiting outreach, we generally include the link to the official job posting in the initial email. The only exceptions (where we might do outreach before putting up a public job description) are people management or executive roles.</li><li><strong>Offering a job with no video interview</strong>. People who come to work at Kapwing will always have a video or phone interview before getting an offer.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Partner.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="892" height="230" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Partner.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Partner.png 892w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Broken English, typos, no LinkedIn links, and inconsistent information may signal a recruiting scam. For example, in this case, candidates received the ‚Äúoffer letter‚Äù with our old company logo in the letterhead instead of the <a href="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/making-kapwings-new-brand/">new logo</a> we introduced recently. The offer letter was also signed by a random &#34;Advisor&#34; named Tom Gahm (who actually doesn&#39;t exist) rather than the CEO.</p><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-13-at-8.43.49-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="718" height="370" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-13-at-8.43.49-AM.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-13-at-8.43.49-AM.png 718w"/></figure><p>The initial email also had no subject line, and there were some typos throughout. But both of these are mistakes that a scrappy startup could easily make.</p><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Complex-Scam.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="868" height="408" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Complex-Scam.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Complex-Scam.png 868w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h2 id="what-to-do-to-verify-the-legitimacy-of-recruiter-outreach">What To Do To Verify the Legitimacy of Recruiter Outreach</h2><p>As a startup, we do send emails to job seekers sometimes about positions that are open at Kapwing. We also get plenty of third-party recruiters who send us resumes and ask us to pay commission if that candidate is hired. As a result, I know that there&#39;s a lot of inbound recruiting communications, and it can be difficult to distinguish the real from the scam.</p><p>However, if you get an email about a job that seems too good to be true, it probably is. Listen to your gut if there are warning signals, and be aware of your own vulnerability. Here&#39;s two courses of action you can take if you‚Äôre concerned that you may be the target of a recruiting scam:</p><ol><li>If you&#39;re at all suspicious, visit the company‚Äôs website and <strong>send an email </strong>to their corporate email address. Candidates can also ping someone (like a Recruiting or HR lead) from the company on LinkedIn to ask them if the posting is real. Don&#39;t be shy ‚Äì we would <em>never </em>penalize a candidate for asking us about a legitimate job opening. In fact, we would probably appreciate it as a sign of enthusiasm. ¬†</li><li>Respond to the supposed recruiter with <strong>questions</strong> that require a 2-4 sentence response. Legitimate recruiters will be familiar with questions about company culture and the position, but someone with broken English or no affiliation to the company will struggle and may give themselves away. Some questions could be:</li></ol><ul><li>What is unique about Kapwing‚Äôs company culture?</li><li>What opportunities are there for growth in this role?</li><li>How does this role serve the company‚Äôs mission?</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-13-at-7.55.24-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="870" height="368" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-13-at-7.55.24-AM.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-13-at-7.55.24-AM.png 870w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h2 id="why-did-we-get-targeted">Why Did We Get Targeted</h2><p>I‚Äôm not sure why these crooks designed an elaborate scheme around Kapwing. One reason may be that we had a video creator position listed online a while ago. Since then, we‚Äôve taken it down, but the evidence of the old job description still appears in various directories and credible job boards online like AngelList.</p><p>Video editing is a high-skill task that‚Äôs relevant for our business. It‚Äôs possible that these scammers run this playbook with video editing positions specifically and thought our company, with a fast growing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Kapwing">YouTube channel</a> and a big presence on Google as an <a href="https://www.kapwing.com/video-editor">online video editor</a>, was a believable fit.</p><p>I also had a #hiring frame around my LinkedIn profile.</p><h2 id="what-to-do-if-crooks-are-impersonating-your-company">What To Do if Crooks are Impersonating Your Company</h2><p>When we found out that scammers were impersonating me and Kapwing, we wanted to act immediately to keep vulnerable job seekers safe from thieves. Unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t take much action to report the issue. Here‚Äôs how we responded and how we recommend other startups respond if they‚Äôre the center of a recruiting scam:</p><ol><li><strong>Get back to people</strong> when they message/email you! We quickly wrote a canned response for our customer support email and prioritized scam targets to let people know this is not a legitimate opportunity. I responded to every one of the 13 video editors who sent me a LinkedIn message, and we asked each person to <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/8253?hl=en">report the emails</a> as phishing. </li><li>CEOs can <strong>post on their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/juliaenthoven_this-week-someone-is-impersonating-me-to-activity-6950579385162752001-JSUW?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web">LinkedIn profile</a></strong> about the scam and publish a blog post to notify targets that search for these fake email addresses on Google.</li><li>Remove the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hiring‚Äù frame on LinkedIn (temporarily). Ensure that outdated job postings are removed from live job sites.</li></ol><p>How do other companies avoid ending up in this type of scam? And how are you supposed to respond if someone is impersonating you? I wish I had more that I could do to defend video editors who have been targeted.</p><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Legitimate.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="764" height="210" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Legitimate.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2022/07/Legitimate.png 764w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>I hope that this article helps people who might be targeted by this scheme and avoids theft.
