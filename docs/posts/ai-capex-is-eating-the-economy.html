<h2 id="rough-notes">Rough Notes:</h2><h3 id="honey-ai-capex-ate-the-economy">Honey, AI Capex Ate the Economy</h3><p>How extreme is <strong>AI datacenter spending</strong>? It is to the point that even Chinese President <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> is  warning about it. With more than <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d6601f0-c7cf-48a8-9ae2-e9820dedf0b0" rel="noreferrer"><strong>250 datacenters</strong></a> under construction in his country, this week he <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9c19d26f-57b3-4754-ac20-eeb627e8723e" rel="noreferrer">cautioned</a> against the<strong> spending rush</strong>, threatening to intervene:</p><blockquote>“When it comes to projects, there are a few things — artificial intelligence, computing power and new energy vehicles. Do all provinces in the country have to develop industries in these directions?&#34;</blockquote><p>The U.S., however, leads the <strong>capex spending</strong> way. One analyst recently speculated (via <a href="https://www.edwardconard.com/macro-roundup/using-nvidias-datacenter-revenue-as-a-reference-for-us-ai-capex-jensnordvig-estimates-that-ai-will-make-up-2-of-us-gdp-in-2025-given-a-standard-multiplier-implying-an-ai-contribution-to-g/?view=detail&amp;filters=macro-roundup-database" rel="noreferrer">Ed Conard</a>) that, based on Nvidia&#39;s latest datacenter sales figures, AI capex may be <strong>~2% of US GDP in 2025</strong>, given a standard multiplier. This would imply an AI contribution to <strong>GDP growth of 0.7%</strong> in 2025.</p><p>I wrote previously about some of the <a href="https://paulkedrosky.com/weekend-reading-plus-spvs-meta-and-fiber-buildout-2-0/" rel="noreferrer">unintended consequences</a>, in particular the emergence of <strong>off-balance sheet funding</strong> vehicles. Let&#39;s dive into its size and consequences again, however, with <strong>three thoughts</strong> in mind: </p><ol><li>The above impact estimates may be a <strong>lower bound</strong>.</li><li>The redirected capital spending is <strong>coming from somewhere</strong>. </li><li>All this spending helps explain <strong>a mystery</strong>.</li></ol><h3 id="1-a-lower-bound">1. A Lower Bound?</h3><p>Here are some basic numbers to get things started:</p><ul><li>US 2025 GDP: <strong>$25 trillion</strong> (Source: Consensus forecasts and extrapolations from BEA data)</li><li>Nvidia sales to datacenters (Q1 FY2026): <strong>$39.1B (</strong>Annualized: <strong>$156.4B)</strong></li><li>% of Nvidia datacenter sales that is AI related: <strong>~99%</strong> (Primarily H100/GH200 sales to hyperscalers and enterprises)</li><li>Nvidia share of datacenter capex: <strong>25-35%</strong></li><li>Economic multiplier: <strong>1.5x-2.0x</strong></li><li>Implied total datacenter capex: <strong>~$520B</strong> (156.4b/0.3)</li></ul><p>So, to get the total GDP impact, including multipliers, do the simple math:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>These are very large numbers given that before 2022 AI capex was likely less than 0.1% of GDP. It has, in three years, <strong>grown by at least 10x</strong> from there, and perhaps more than that. </p><p>Compare this to <strong>prior capex frenzies</strong>, like railroads or telecom. <strong>Peak railroad</strong> spending came in 19th century, and <strong>peak telecom</strong> spending was around the 5G/fiber frenzy. It&#39;s not clear whether we&#39;re at peak yet or not, but ... we&#39;re up there. Capital expenditures on AI data centers is likely around <strong>20% of the peak spending on railroads</strong>, as a percentage of GDP, and it is still rising quickly. And we&#39;ve already passed the decades ago <strong>peak in telecom spending</strong> during the dot-com bubble</p><figure><img src="https://paulkedrosky.com/content/images/2025/07/2025-07-16_13-51-16-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1290" srcset="https://paulkedrosky.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/2025-07-16_13-51-16-3.png 600w, https://paulkedrosky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/2025-07-16_13-51-16-3.png 1000w, https://paulkedrosky.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/07/2025-07-16_13-51-16-3.png 1600w, https://paulkedrosky.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/07/2025-07-16_13-51-16-3.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Again, these are <strong>raw capex numbers</strong>, unadjusted for multiplier effects. In other words, it&#39;s just the purchasing and building of that stuff, not whether you, as a recipient of some of this spending, <strong>renovated your kitchen</strong>. To calculate the total economic effect you would apply the economic <strong>multiplier</strong> I laid out above, and <strong>the numbers become even larger</strong>. I return to this in the final part of this essay.</p><h3 id="2-where-is-the-money-coming-from">2. Where is the Money Coming From?</h3><p>Private capital expenditures don&#39;t, for the most part, come from nowhere. While governments can print money to spend, companies generally can&#39;t. Where is all this capital coming from? </p><p>For the most part, six sources:</p><ol><li><strong>Internal Cash Flows</strong> (Primary for <strong>Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta</strong>, etc. )</li><li><strong>Debt Issuance</strong> (Rising role)</li><li><strong>Equity &amp; Follow-on Offerings</strong></li><li><strong>Venture Capital / Private Equity</strong> (CoreWeave, Lambda, etc.)</li><li><strong>SPVs, Leasing, and Asset-Backed Vehicles </strong>(like <a href="https://paulkedrosky.com/weekend-reading-plus-spvs-meta-and-fiber-buildout-2-0/" rel="noreferrer">Meta&#39;s</a> recent)</li><li><strong>Cloud Consumption Commitments</strong> (mostly hyperscalers)</li></ol><p>But by spending <strong>GDP-moving amounts </strong>of money on GPUs and such, it is not, by definition, being spent on something else. </p><p>Some examples:</p><ul><li>Non- life science <strong>venture capitalists</strong> are mostly only doing AI right now. Have something else needing funding? Good luck with that.</li><li><strong>Cloud compute</strong> companies are diverting spending from cloud offering to GPU-centric data centers. Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-17/amazon-cuts-jobs-in-cloud-services-arm-amid-spiraling-ai-costs" rel="noreferrer">recent cloud layoff announcement</a> is being driven by this; Microsoft&#39;s recent layoffs are better understood in this light than as being driven by AI taking jobs, as some argued. </li><li>Price-earnings multiples on <strong>public AI &#34;plays&#34;</strong> are soaring, reflection disproportionate investor allocation to these companies, and less to others, who can no longer obtain capital as cheaply.</li><li><strong>Manufacturing and other infrastructure</strong> are, to a degree, starved for capital as it increasingly gets re-routed to datacenters.</li></ul><p>All of this has consequences, or will. The <strong>telecom capex bubble</strong> lead to a sharp decline in &#34;other&#34; infrastructure spending, one that is still playing out. The <strong>datacenter spending frenzy</strong> will almost certainly do the same, <strong>starving</strong> other infrastructure for money. </p><h3 id="3-solving-an-economic-mystery">3. Solving an Economic Mystery</h3><p>One of the <strong>abiding mysteries</strong> of the current political era is why the economy is, for the most part, <strong>not as worried</strong> as one might expect about tariffs, political uncertainty, capricious <strong>office-renovation-driven-Fed-chair</strong> rumored removals. </p><p>We now have a <strong>possible answer</strong>. In a sense, there is a <strong>massive private sector stimulus program</strong> underway in the U.S.. There is an <strong>AI datacenter spending </strong>program, one that is <strong>reallocating</strong> gobs of spending, as well as injecting even more. It is already larger than <strong>peak telecom spending</strong> (as a percentage of GDP) during the dot-com era, and within shouting distance of <strong>peak 19th century railroad </strong>infrastructure spending. </p><p>So, how big was this <strong>&#34;stimulus&#34;</strong> in the first quarter? Back of ... something or another, based on the above figures:</p><ul><li>Without AI datacenter investment, Q1 GDP contraction could have been <strong>closer to –2.1% </strong></li><li>AI capex was likely the early-2025 difference between a<strong> mild contraction and a deep one</strong>, helping <strong>mask underlying economic weakness</strong>.</li></ul><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>We are in a historically <strong>anomalous moment</strong>. Regardless of what one thinks about the merits of AI or <strong>explosive datacenter expansion</strong>, the scale and pace of capital deployment into a <strong>rapidly depreciating technology</strong> is remarkable. These are not railroads—we aren’t building <strong>century-long infrastructure</strong>. AI datacenters are short-lived, asset-intensive facilities riding declining-cost technology curves, requiring <strong>frequent hardware replacement</strong> to preserve margins.</p><p>And this surge has <strong>unintended consequences</strong>. Capital is being aggressively reallocated—from <strong>venture</strong> funding to internal <strong>budgets</strong>—at the expense of other sectors. Entire categories are being <strong>starved</strong> of investment, and large-scale <strong>layoffs</strong> are already happening. The irony: AI is driving mass <strong>job losses</strong> <em>well before</em> it has been <strong>widely deployed</strong>.</p><h2 id="rougher-notes">Rougher Notes:</h2><p>University of California <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/16744e1e-335a-477f-b24c-b07ee5573352?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=7c8f09b9-9b61-4fbb-9430-9208a9e233c8#myft:notification:daily-email:content" rel="noreferrer">ditches hedge funds</a> with scathing rebuke ... <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-17/inside-jane-street-s-trading-scrutiny-in-india" rel="noopener">Jane Street’s trading scrutiny in India</a> … <a href="https://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/73660" rel="noopener">Mosaic looted by Nazi officer</a> returned to Pompeii … <a href="https://www.sci.news/medicine/erythritol-14075.html" rel="noopener">Common sweetener erythritol</a> may impact brain cells, boost stroke risk … <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/07/culture-critics-endangered-species-1236461466/" rel="noopener">Culture critics as we know them</a> might be an endangered species … Did <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262625000764" rel="noopener">increasing brain size</a> place early humans at risk of extinction? … <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/07/17/bit-by-bit-the-world-economys-resilience-is-being-worn-away" rel="noopener">World economy’s resilience</a> being worn away bit by bit … <a href="https://www.kkr.com/insights/mid-year-update-2025" rel="noopener">KKR mid-year outlook</a>: make your own luck … <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu6897" rel="noopener">Robot metabolism</a>: machines that grow by consuming others … American&#39;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/business/whey-protein-dairy-industry.html" rel="noopener">whey protein obsession</a> is reshaping the dairy industry … <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/ex-waymo-engineers-launch-bedrock-robotics-with-80m-to-automate-construction" rel="noopener">Ex-Waymo engineers</a> are trying to roboticize construction … <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-07-13/china-drugmakers-catching-up-to-us-big-pharma-with-new-medicine-innovation" rel="noopener">China drugmakers</a> are catching up to US Big Pharma</p>
