    <h1>Collatz Arithmetic</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Pick a natural number <em>n</em> and apply the following transformation to it: if <em>n</em> is even, the output will be <strong><em>n / 2</em></strong>; otherwise, if <em>n</em> is odd, the output will be <strong><em>3n + 1</em></strong>. Keep doing this until <em>1</em> is reached.</p>

<p>Will this procedure always reach <em>1</em>? That is, is this a <strong><a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2022/04/01/total-partial-functions.html">total function</a></strong>? The <strong>Collatz Conjecture</strong> says yes, but this has not been proved or disproved. It has also not been proved or disproved that it can be proved or disproved.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.120.03.192">John Conway</a></strong> argued that the Collatz Conjecture is both <em>true</em> and <strong><em>unsettleable</em></strong>: it cannot be proved, and it cannot be proved that it cannot be proved, and so on. This is not a particularly satisfying situation, but it could very well be the case.</p>

<p>Call the Collatz transformation <em>C</em>. Notice that if <em>C(n)</em> really does reach <em>1</em> and terminate for a given <em>n</em>, this is <strong>always provable</strong>, and indeed the number of iterations required can be explictly calculated. That is, we can exhibit a number <em>k</em> such that <em>C<sup>k</sup>(n) = 1</em>. So if the conjecture is true but not provable, then this means that each <strong>instance</strong> is provable, but the <strong>generalization</strong> is not. In symbols:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‚ä¢ <em>‚àÉk C<sup>k</sup>(1) = 1</em></li>
  <li>‚ä¢ <em>‚àÉk C<sup>k</sup>(2) = 1</em></li>
  <li>‚ä¢ <em>‚àÉk C<sup>k</sup>(3) = 1</em></li>
  <li>‚ä¢ <em>‚àÉk C<sup>k</sup>(4) = 1</em></li>
  <li>‚Ä¶</li>
  <li>‚ä¨ <em>‚àÄn ‚àÉk C<sup>k</sup>(n) = 1</em></li>
</ul>

<p>This last statement is formalization of the Collatz conjecture, and we‚Äôll refer to it as <strong>CC</strong>.</p>

<p>But ‚Äúprovable‚Äù isn‚Äôt an absolute property ‚Äì provability is always with respect to some <strong>theory</strong>. What theory are we talking about here? The answer is: <strong>take your pick</strong>. The conjecture is not known to be decided by any theory in common use: <strong>Peano arithmetic (PA)</strong>, set theory, whatever. For simplicity, we‚Äôll assume PA as our background theory.</p>

<p><strong>Let‚Äôs assume that CC is true and also not provable in PA.</strong> These assumptions imply that the <strong>negation</strong> of CC is not provable either, or in other words that CC is <strong>independent</strong> of PA. This being the case, we are free to add either CC or its negation to PA as <strong>new axioms</strong> and the resulting theory will be <strong>consistent</strong>. Adding the negation, however, yields a theory that is <strong><em>ùúî-inconsistent</em></strong>, or more simply, <strong>unsound</strong>. It says things about the natural numbers that are <strong>not true</strong>. (Alternatively, it can be looked at as a theory of <em>number-like objects</em> that are not numbers.)</p>

<p>So we‚Äôll add CC as a new axiom to PA. Call the resulting theory <strong>Collatz arithmetic (CA)</strong>. CA is strictly stronger than PA, since CA ‚ä¢ CC but (by hypothesis) PA ‚ä¨ CC. <strong>What other kinds of things can be proved in CA but not PA?</strong></p>

<p>Before getting to that, let‚Äôs get <em>C</em> into a more workable form. To say that <em>n</em> is even is to say that has the form <em>2k</em>, so instead of saying that <em>C(n) = n / 2</em>, we can say that <strong><em>C(2k) = k</em></strong>. Similarly, to say that <em>n</em> is odd is to say that it has the form <em>2k + 1</em>, and <em>3(2k + 1) + 1 = 6k + 4</em>. But notice that if <em>n</em> is odd, <em>3n + 1</em> will always be even, immediately triggering the even clause. The Collatz function can be ‚Äúaccelerated‚Äù slightly by applying this immediately. With a little algebra, this works out to <strong><em>C(2k + 1) = 3k + 2</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs consider a variation of the Collatz function that we‚Äôll call the <strong>Half Collatz</strong> function. Define a transformation function <em>H</em> to be just like <em>C</em> except that it leaves its even arguments alone ‚Äì in other words, <strong><em>H(n = 2k) = n</em></strong> and <strong><em>H(2k + 1) = 3k + 2</em></strong>. And instead of applying its tranformation until the argument reaches <em>1</em>, apply it until its argument is even.</p>

<p>Will the Half Collatz function eventually reach an even number for all inputs? Call this statement the <strong>Half Collatz Conjecture (HCC)</strong>. Like CC, HCC appears to be both true and unprovable, PA ‚ä¨ HCC. <strong>But HCC is provable in CA, CA ‚ä¢ HCC.</strong> For suppose that <em>n</em> is a number &gt; 1 such that repeated applications of <em>H</em> never reach an even number. By CC, there is a <em>k</em> such that <em>C<sup>k</sup>(n) = 1</em>. <em>n &gt; 1</em>, so it must get reduced at some point. That reduction only happens when the even clause of <em>C</em> is triggered, so <em>n</em> must eventually reach an even number. ‚ä£</p>

<p>Finally, consider one more transformation function: <strong><em>B(n = 3k) = n</em></strong> and <strong><em>B(3k + r) = 5k + 3 + r</em></strong> (with <em>r = 1</em> or <em>r = 2</em>). We‚Äôll call this the <strong>Beaver Collatz</strong> function, since this is the function implemented by the <strong><a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/10/31/busy-beaver-derived.html">4-state 2-color Beeping Busy Beaver champion</a></strong>. The <strong>Beaver Collatz Conjecture (BCC)</strong> says that repeated applications of <em>B</em> will eventually reach a number divisible by <em>3</em> for all inputs. (For a good time, try starting with <em>2</em>.) BCC seems to be true, and presumably it is also unprovable in PA. <strong>Is BCC provable in CA, CA ‚ä¢ BCC?</strong> I conjecture that it is.</p>

<p>We saw that CA ‚ä¢ HCC. But this is equivalent to saying that PA ‚ä¢ CC ‚Üí HCC, so <strong>why bother with a new axiom?</strong> Why not just stick with PA and take CC as a hypothesis? Well, if Conway is right, CC is both true and unsettleable. To me this says that CC opens up <strong>a whole new method of reasoning</strong>, a method of reasoning that is totally inaccessible otherwise. ‚ÄúUnsettleable‚Äù is a strong word, and Collatz-based arguments must be correspondingly strong.</p>

<p>But if CA ‚ä¨ BCC, then the new method of reasoning seems somewhat weak. BCC would presumably be <strong>unsettleable even in CA</strong>, and would therefore have to be added as <strong>yet another new axiom</strong>. There‚Äôs a whole world of <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.1029.pdf">Collatz-like functions</a></strong>; are they all <strong>co-unsettleable</strong>? I suppose that‚Äôs possible, but it‚Äôs also possible that there are classes of such functions that are <strong>co-provable</strong>. That is my feeling.</p>
