<blockquote><p>According to internal Slack messages that were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-chatgpt-openai-warns-employees-not-share-confidential-information-microsoft-2023-1">leaked to <i>Insider</i></a>, an Amazon lawyer told workers that they had “already seen instances” of text generated by ChatGPT that “closely” resembled internal company data.</p>
<p>This issue seems to have come to a head recently because Amazon staffers and other tech workers throughout the industry have begun using ChatGPT as a “<a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/01/chatgpt-python-programming-assistant.html">coding assistant</a>” of sorts to help them write or improve strings of code, the report notes.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“This is important because your inputs may be used as training data for a further iteration of ChatGPT,” the lawyer wrote in the Slack messages viewed by Insider, “and we wouldn’t want its output to include or resemble our confidential information.”</p></blockquote>
