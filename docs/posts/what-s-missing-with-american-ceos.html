Beyond a few kinds of organization – the church, the military, a smattering of large trading, construction, and agricultural endeavors (many unfortunately based on slave labor) – little existed that we would recognize as managerial practice. </p></blockquote><p>That fairly drips snobbery. “Slave labor!”</p><p>The rap on joining a family-run company, call it “Scheisskopf Co.” (to pick a character from Catch-22) is the prejudice that, if your name isn’t Scheisskopf, you can never rise very much.

Taleb says:</p><blockquote><p>Products or companies that bear the owner&#39;s name convey very valuable messages. They are shouting that they have something to lose. Eponymy indicates both a commitment to the company and a confidence in the product. A friend of mine, Paul Wilmott, is often called an egomaniac for having his name on a mathematical finance technical journal (Wilmott), which at the time of writing is undoubtedly the best. &#34;Egomaniac&#34; is good for the product. But if you can&#39;t get &#34;egomaniac,&#34; &#34;arrogant&#34; will do. </p></blockquote><p><span>Like South Fork in </span><em>Dallas</em><span> two generations ago, Yellowstone Dutton Ranch is a </span><em>family business. </em><span>It’s not a soulless corporation.

Kong Gumi has been in operation for around 1443 years, predating the second-oldest company by more than 200 years. It used to be a family-owned construction company until 2006, after facing some difficult times, it became a subsidiary of the Takamatsu Construction Group. </p></blockquote><p>There are actually a lot of companies more than 700 years old (founded before 1300 AD). 23 of the 62 are Japanese, while Germany and the UK also have quite a few. 13 of them are hotels, while 8 are breweries.</p><p><span>You can find endless scholarly articles on the “agency problem” of corporations: ostensibly, that the company’s assets are under the control of someone who doesn’t own them, the “agent” or professional manager.

From </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carly_Fiorina" rel="">Wikipedia</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Fiorina received a larger signing offer than any of her predecessors, including: US$65 million in restricted stock to compensate her for the Lucent stock and options she left behind, a US$3 million signing bonus, a US$1 million annual salary (plus a US$1.25–US$3.75 million annual bonus), US$36,000 in mortgage assistance, a relocation allowance, and permission (and encouragement) to use company planes for personal affairs.</p></blockquote><p>How about taking on risk if she failed? As it happened, she ran the company into the ground and got fired:</p><blockquote><p>In 2004, HP fell dramatically short of its predicted third-quarter earnings, and Fiorina fired three executives during a 5 AM telephone call. In early January 2005, the Hewlett-Packard board of directors discussed with Fiorina a list of issues that the board had regarding the company&#39;s performance and disappointing earning reports. The board proposed a plan to shift her authority to HP division heads, which Fiorina resisted strongly. A week after the meeting, the confidential plan was leaked to The Wall Street Journal. According to BusinessWeek&#39;s Ben Elgin, directors were also concerned about the board&#39;s inability to work effectively with Fiorina.</p><p>Less than a month later, the board brought back Tom Perkins and forced Fiorina to resign as chair and chief executive officer of the company.

His Webvan employment agreement, signed September 19, 1999 was filed with the SEC. Under Shaheen, the company underwent an IPO in November 1999, raising $375 million with stocks soaring, and the company valued at $8.45 billion. Shares afterwards dropped sharply with the dotcom bubble. He resigned as CEO of WebVan in April 2001. His retirement pack included collecting $375,000 each year for the rest of his life from WebVan. Webvan declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2001. When the company filed bankruptcy, Shaheen became an unsecured creditor. In 2010, Business Insider named him one of the 15 Worst CEOs in American History, citing his involvement with Webvan.</p></blockquote><p><span>So: $375 million of investors’ money down the drain.

When women first see him, they tend to describe him as “gorgeous.” He dresses in custom-made suits. His silvery hair is perfectly parted. He speaks in such calm, polished, slightly accented tones that he makes the phrase “market share” sound like a line out of Goethe. In appearance and attitude, Pfeiffer is about as far from an eccentric, Bill Gates–like techno-nerd as one can imagine.</p></blockquote><p>By 1994, his relentless cost-cutting had made Compaq the top PC manufacturer. But that wasn’t enough for him. He had a terminal case of IBM Envy, desperately yearning for their “services and solutions” business.  In 1997, he bought Tandem Computers, and in 1998, Digital Equipment Corp., two legacy businesses that had already seen their better days. Like nearly all big tech mergers, these did not work out, and Pfeiffer had no idea what the newly-giant company would do, or how.</p><p>After missing Wall Street expectations in three of six quarters, Pfeiffer was fired by the Board in April 1999.</p><h5>No Skin Off His Nose</h5><p>I hope by now, you’re not expecting the story to end with, “.. and then he was disgraced and reduced to selling timeshares in Florida.”</p><p>Wikipedia says:</p><blockquote><p>Pfeiffer received $6 million in severance pay, and received $70 million worth of stock options that vested immediately as a result of his forced resignation. At the time of his departure, Pfeiffer held 9.5 million exercisable options valued at nearly $340 million which vested but Pfeiffer had not yet cashed the options.</p></blockquote><p>He’s also served on several corporate boards.</p><p><span>Now we get some of the reasons why people like these get those jobs: they </span><em>look good</em><span>.

But image matters quite a bit when there is hierarchy and standardized &#34;job evaluation.&#34; Consider the chief executive officers of corporations: they don&#39;t just look the part, they even look the same. And, worse, when you listen to them talk, they sound the same, down to the same vocabulary and metaphors.

Pavlov was arrested and executed after his forces were heavily defeated in the early days of the campaign. Only two of the accused were spared: People&#39;s Commissar of Armaments Boris Vannikov (released in July 1941) and Deputy People&#39;s Commissar of Defense General Kirill Meretskov (released in September 1941), although the latter had admitted guilt, under torture.</p><p>About three hundred commanders, including Lieutenant General Nikolay Klich, Lieutenant General Robert Klyavinsh, and Major General Sergey Chernykh, were executed on 16 October 1941, during the Battle of Moscow. Others were sent to Kuybyshev, provisional capital of the Soviet Union, on 17 October. On 28 October 1941, twenty individuals were summarily shot near Kuybyshev on Lavrentiy Beria&#39;s personal order, including Colonel Generals Alexander Loktionov and Grigory Shtern, Lieutenant Generals Fyodor Arzhenukhin, Ivan Proskurov, Yakov Smushkevich, and Pavel Rychagov with his wife, as well as several individuals who had been previously arrested during the immediate aftermath of the Great Purge in 1939, prior to the Red Army Purge of 1941, including politicians Filipp Goloshchyokin and Mikhail Kedrov.[</p><p>In November 1941, Beria successfully lobbied Stalin to simplify the procedure for carrying out death sentences issued by local military courts so that they would no longer require approval of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court and Politburo, for the first time since the end of the Great Purge. The right to issue extrajudicial death sentences was granted to the Special Council of the NKVD.</p><p>On 29 January 1942, forty-six persons, including 17 generals, among them Lieutenant Generals Pyotr Pumpur, Pavel Alekseyev, Konstantin Gusev, Yevgeny Ptukhin, Nikolai Trubetskoy, Pyotr Klyonov, Ivan Selivanov, Major General Ernst Schacht, and People&#39;s Commissar of Ammunition Ivan Sergeyev, were sentenced to death by the Special Council. After the explicit approval of Stalin, they were executed on the Day of the Red Army, 23 February 1942.</p></blockquote><p><span>Now </span><em>that</em><span> is called Skin In The Game.</span></p><p><em>“So what: you’re saying we should kill CEO’s and generals who fail?”</em></p><p>No, of course not.

A Westerner who runs a blog about doing business in Japan says </span><a href="https://www.disruptingjapan.com/the-japanese-trap-of-the-glorious-failure/" rel="">this</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>My very first job in Japan, and this was a long time ago, was at Fujitsu, and the section chief, Taniguchi-bucho explained promotions and failure in corporate Japan this way.</p><p>“In both America and Japan promotions are based on the point system. Whoever has the most points get promoted. The big difference, however, is that in America you start at zero, and points are awarded for your successes, but in Japan, you start at zero, and points are subtracted for your failures. In Japan zero is the highest possible score.”</p><p>So, in America, you succeed by succeeding, but in Japan, you succeed by not failing. This caused me endless frustration early in my career. Like most founders, I’m an optimistic, proactive, get-things-done kind of person.</p><p>But there I was sitting in meeting after meeting where everyone in the room would take turns eagerly, confidently pointing out risks or potential problems with the plan, but no one offering a single constructive suggestion.</p><p>I eventually figured out, that this was simply how management worked in Japan.</p><p>It is the junior staffer’s job to do the research and come up with the plans, and management’s job to de-risk those plans and to approve them. Unless a manager is among colleagues he really trusts, it would foolish for him to suggest a new innovative solution in an open meeting. It’s not his job, and he’d be opening himself up to blame if things failed. Pointing out risks, on the other hand, is seen as helping prevent failure. It’s a sign of competence and teamwork.</p></blockquote><p><span>This </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/smartstartupenglish/episode-13-the-stigma-of-failure-in-german-startups-business-english" rel="">podcast</a><span> (which, oddly enough, explains how to speak “Business English” for non-native-English speakers) talks about German attitudes towards failure. It has a “stigma” about it. German investors shy away from anyone who has failed before.</span></p><p><span>This </span><a href="https://www.countrynavigator.com/blog/how-do-different-cultures-view-failure/" rel="">page</a><span> explains that failure is frowned upon in Germany and in many countries of the world. I don’t think any have the elaborate rituals of public apology and abasement that Japan has, but in most of these countries, fear of lasting stigma is very much your Skin in the Game.</span></p><p><span>And then we come to America, where failing at something is almost a </span><em>good</em><span> thing. “Hey, you’ve now learned what doesn’t work. Now use that and do something that does!”</span></p><p><span>The problem is that it’s gone too far. Some of these people (the ones who didn’t end up in prison at least) really </span><em>should</em><span> be stigmatized and never work again, except maybe for selling timeshares in Florida.</span></p><p>Suppose a Board of Directors said to a CEO candidate: “Tell us your net worth. We will be checking that figure, by the way. Write a check to the company for half of that, and we’ll give you stock, and throw in a bunch extra as a signing bonus. Besides that, you’ll get a salary equal to fifty times that of the lowest paid worker here. If you’re fired, there is no golden parachute.”</p><p>Would any of our three poster children CEOs have taken that deal? Obviously not, but maybe that would have been a good thing. Maybe they’d have ended up with some person with no charisma whatsoever, but who knew the business cold.</p></div></div></div></div>
