    <h1>Decision Fatigue</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Trying to keep up with the news this month is <em>hard</em>. Trying to derive patterns from the news in order to blog about them coherently? Even harder, leading to decision fatigue—but I&#39;m going to have a stab at it ...</p>

<p>The big buried lede of the past decade is that authoritarian conservatives network internationally as pervasively as the soi-disant &#34;international communism&#34; they railed against from the 1920s through the 1960s. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine it&#39;s become glaringly clear that authoritarianism is the preferred governmental mode of petrochemical resource extraction economies (money attracts sociopaths, sociopaths like authoritarian leaders because they are convenient single points of failure for corruption-prevention systems, authoritarian leaders appeal to authoritarian followers). </p>

        </div><div id="more">
            <p>This century the PREEs are all panicking. The price of new photovoltaic panels is dropping in line with Moore&#39;s Law and as a result it&#39;s now cheaper to install PV panels than to keep existing coal-fired power stations running: the result is a mad dash to pump <em>all</em> the oil and gas they can get out of the ground before all that new renewable infrastructure is coupled to new distribution and usage tech that will reduce the demand for constant base load. (Big Carbon must be absolutely terrified of better battery technologies—not necessarily lighter or higher capacity, but cheaper to manufacture, safer to deploy and recycle, and longer life—suitable for grid-scale load averaging or backup.)</p>

<p>In addition to pumping out CO2, they&#39;ve been pumping out propaganda. Russia got into the game by boosting the factions in the west most tightly associated with climate change denialism (the hard right): the hard right also swung behind Putin&#39;s imperialist revanchism (look at how many US Republican leaders are pro-Russia all of a sudden).</p>

<p>It&#39;s looking since the US midterms like the new hotness in western hard right circles is going to be <em>the war on youth</em>. Young people (especially women and people of colour) <em>overwhelmingly</em> reject white male supremacism, for fairly obvious reasons: they&#39;re also more inclined to be worried about climate change. An immediate response by authoritarians is to push back against any resistance. In the USA, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/16/gen-z-helped-to-stop-the-red-wave-in-the-midterms-the-republicans-response-try-to-raise-the-voting-age">Republicans propose raising the voting age to 21 or even 28</a>; in the UK, <a href="https://bigissue.com/news/politics/new-voter-id-laws-make-it-harder-for-young-people-to-vote/">New voter ID laws discriminate against young people</a> (old peoples&#39; bus passes are acceptable at polling stations, but young persons&#39; railcards are not), and in Iran we&#39;re seeing <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/iran-protests-young-people-risking-their-lives-in-demonstrations-12732787">a striking display of inter-generational violence</a>, as the ageing male authoritarian fundamentalists of the post-1979 revolution shoot young female demonstrators in the streets.</p>

<p>If anything, this should be heartening news: <strong>the kids are all right</strong>. They&#39;re marching for action on climate change, they&#39;re voting against fascism. Not universally, not all of them (some are going full Nazi, or becoming incels, or murderous mediaeval cosplayers like Da&#39;esh)—but enough that the far right are clearly a generational problem.</p>

<p>Some years ago, when asked, SF author Bruce Sterling summed up the 21st century as &#34;old people, living in cities, afraid of the sky&#34;. Well, Earth&#39;s human population is over 50% urban at this point, the sky is becoming bloody dangerous (climate!), and as for the old people ... the young are trying to adapt, the gerontocracy are pushing back, but eventually the current gerontocrats will die out.</p>

<p><em>The other striking news of the week</em> is Elon Musk&#39;s epic flaming death spiral at the helm of Twitter. (Which currently eclipses the news that Mark Zuckerberg wasted $15Bn on a virtual reality system with, like, about 60 thousand users, and Facebook is going to undergo huge spending cuts over the next year by way of adjustment.)</p>

<p>Reader, I am not charmed by this. Musk&#39;s big mouth got him into an untenable position, and now he&#39;s thrashing around destructively. I&#39;m not going to recap the arguments here, but I suspect twitter is likely to crash hard within the next few days to week or two (at most) and Musk has fired most of the people who can fix it and keep it running. He&#39;s also fired everybody involved in international regulatory compliance: he seems to think that the relatively libertarian and under-regulated political regime of California is universal. In reality, twitter is subject to GDPR, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a> thanks to it handling EU citizens&#39; data. </p>

<p>GDPR, for Americans, essentially defines a constitutional-level right to online privacy throughout the EU <em>and it is applicable to any corporation processing EU citizens&#39; data</em>: it was designed <em>specifically</em> to prevent the sort of abuses that took place in the Third Reich, when the Nazis ransacked existing punched card databases to identify Jews and other undesirables for arrest and murder. The fines are draconian (up to 4% of the corporation&#39;s  annual global turnover) <em>and can be levied separately by each nation&#39;s data privacy regulator</em>. Hint: there are 27 of them, adding up to a potential liability of fines equal to 108% of annual turnover (if all the regulators were to hammer Twitter with the maximum level of fines simultaneously).</p>

<p>Musk&#39;s takeover has drawn a spotlight to the big social media platforms&#39; collective failure to deal with false news, bullying, and extremist politics. While second tier platforms (think Mastodon) are nowhere near to providing a refuge yet, I expect any big social media that survive into 2024 will be facing vastly tighter governmental regulatory controls.</p>

<p><em>Final news</em>: Cryptocurrencies seem to be collapsing left right and centre as the main exchanges go bust and are exposed as fronts for securities fraud. I could say &#34;I hate to say <a href="https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/12/why-i-want-bitcoin-to-die-in-a.html">I told you so</a>&#34; but I&#39;d be lying. (And yes, I told you so right here on this blog, nine years ago.) Schadenfreude is wonderfully heart-warming in a time of otherwise terrible news!</p>
