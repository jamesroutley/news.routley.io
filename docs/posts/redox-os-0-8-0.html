<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>We have a lot to show since the <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/news/release-0.7.0/">0.7.0</a> release! This
release, care has been taken to ensure real hardware is working, i686 support
has been added, features like audio and preliminary multi-display support have
been enabled, and the boot and install infrastructure has been simplified and
made more robust. I highly recommend skimming through the <a href="#changes">changes</a>
listed below before jumping into the <a href="#images">images</a>, if you want more
details. It is also recommended to read through the
<a href="https://doc.redox-os.org/book/">Redox OS book</a> if you want more information on
how to build and use Redox OS.</p>

<p>For this release, I would like to personally thank Ron Williams, who goes by
<code>rw_van</code> in the Redox OS chat and GitLab. Ron has provided many valuable
contributions for this release, including vast updates to the
<a href="https://doc.redox-os.org/book/">book</a>, support for building with <code>podman</code>,
improvements to the build infrastructure, performing hardware testing, and more.
I would also like to thank our Redox OS Summer of Code (RSoC) students, whose
work was detailed in prior news posts and much of this work is included in this
release. Finally, I would like to thank the donors to Redox OS, for it is their
contributions that keep our RSoC program and our infrastructure running. Please
consider donating to Redox OS using the links on the <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/donate/">Donate page</a>!</p>

<p>In addition to the exciting technical changes, there is also organizational news
to share. Redox OS received a donation of $400,000 (USD). This donation
was anonymous, and the way in which it was made anonymous has made it not
possible to use at this time. Presently, I am working with a legal team on
determining specifically how the
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash</a>
apply to this donation, which was made through Tornado Cash. At present, as I am
a US citizen, I have blocked the transfer of this donation in order to comply
with potential OFAC sanctions. In the event that I am allowed to use this
donation, I will describe in another news post what it means for Redox OS.</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<p>There have been quite a lot of changes since 0.7.0. I have manually enumerated
what I think is important in this list. Links to exhaustive source-level change
details can be found in the <a href="#exhaustive-details">Exhaustive Details section</a></p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li>Vast improvements to the <a href="https://doc.redox-os.org/book/">book</a></li>
<li>Support for i686 (32-bit x86 from the Pentium II and up) has been added, and
is generally working on real hardware</li>
<li>Support for aarch64 (64-bit ARM) has been improved, and is booting to login on
QEMU. Real hardware is not working yet</li>
<li>Support for multiple displays, if firmware provides framebuffer information</li>
<li>Audio is now generally supported</li>
<li>BIOS and EFI images have been merged, one install can boot on either</li>
<li>The clone and exec syscalls have been moved to userspace. This change also
involved the introduction of
<a href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/bootstrap">bootstrap</a> and
<a href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/escalated">escalated</a>. <code>bootstrap</code> is a
very simply linked program the kernel loads into userspace, that can then handle
loading ELF files such as <code>init</code>. <code>escalated</code> provides support for <code>setuid</code>
programs like <code>sudo</code>.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox-daemon">redox-daemon crate</a>
to simplify setting up daemons</li>
<li>Update cargo lock files on most repositories</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="redox"><code>redox</code></h3>

<ul>
<li>A work in progress hardware compatibility list was added, please consider
contributing your own information: <a href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox/-/blob/master/HARDWARE.md">https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox/-/blob/master/HARDWARE.md</a></li>
<li>The build system was refactored to allow building multiple architectures in
one source tree</li>
<li>Multiple filesystem configs are provided, and can be built side by side in the
same source tree. The default is at <code>config/ARCH/desktop.toml</code>, where <code>ARCH</code> is
by default <code>x86_64</code></li>
<li>A demo configuration, providing example applications not present in the
desktop configuration, has been added</li>
<li>A <code>build.sh</code> script was added to make building for different architectures and
configurations easier</li>
<li>An option for building with <code>podman</code> was added. This option will eventually
become the default, as it eliminates many issues with ensuring a clean build
environment on any potential Linux distribution a user may want to build on</li>
<li>The bootloader, kernel, and initfs packages are now built by the cookbook like
every other package</li>
<li>BIOS and UEFI images have been merged</li>
<li>ISOLinux has been removed, now the <code>bootloader</code> supports booting from CD-ROM
and images always have valid ISO headers</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cookbook"><code>cookbook</code></h3>

<ul>
<li>Support for i686 was added</li>
<li>Builds now happen in a architecture specific folder, so multiple architectures
can be built in the same source tree</li>
<li>Icons and manifests were added for a number of GUI programs, making them show
up in the launcher</li>
<li>Various new recipes were added and many recipes were updated, see detailed
link: <a href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/cookbook/-/compare/c9e203a...3d72057">https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/cookbook/-/compare/c9e203a...3d72057</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="audiod"><code>audiod</code></h3>

<ul>
<li>Support for software volume control was added, with the default being 50%, as
this ends up working well on real hardware. This volume control works by
multiplying the samples by the cube of the volume as a ratio. So, for the
default of 50%, each sample is multiplied by 0.125.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bootloader"><code>bootloader</code></h3>

<ul>
<li>Support for i686 (BIOS) was added</li>
<li>Support for aarch64 (UEFI) was improved</li>
<li>Read performance was increased for BIOS systems</li>
<li>The bootloader can now boot from the same disk image for both BIOS and UEFI
systems</li>
<li>CHS (cylinder, head, sector) support has been added for CD boot</li>
<li>ISO metadata was added to all disk images</li>
<li>Framebuffer stride is now provided to the OS</li>
<li>Multiple displays can now be supported, if using UEFI and there is a GOP
driver for each display</li>
<li>Various fixes for problems on real hardware, see detailed link:
<a href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/bootloader/-/compare/c92ba0b...d398e37">https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/bootloader/-/compare/c92ba0b...d398e37</a></li>

improvements:

<ul>
<li>Improved detection of best output path. Pin sense information is used, and
headphones are prioritized over speakers if they are plugged in</li>
<li>Improved buffer sizing and usage. This prevents static while ensuring
latency is still low. The ac97 driver has identical buffer sizing for
consistency</li>
<li>Ensure all widgets in output path are in power state D0 (on)</li>
<li>Set headphone amp enable on output pins</li>
<li>Fix output stream cyclic buffer length</li>
<li>Ensure all input and output amps in output path are set to 0 dB, based on
