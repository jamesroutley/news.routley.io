    <h1>More than 100 new designs discovered in Peru’s ancient Nazca plain</h1>

The purpose of the Nazca Lines, which could only be seen from the air, remains a mystery.</p><p>This month’s findings, however, are smaller and can be seen from the ground, Masato Sakai, a professor from Yamagata University who led the study, told Reuters.</p><p>The figures, iconic vestiges of Peru’s rich history, are about a three-hour drive from the capital, Lima.</p><p>Researchers had already discovered 190 figures in the area since 2004. But the vastness of the terrain they cover has complicated efforts to study and conserve the heritage site.</p><p>Yamagata University said the research will be used in artificial intelligence-based surveys to help inform the lines’ preservation.</p><p>Studies from the university in collaboration with Peru’s government have helped delineate and protect the area, which is facing threats from urban and economic developments.</p><p>“Some geoglyphs are in danger of being destroyed due to the recent expansion of mining-related workshops in the archaeological park,” Sakai said. </p></div></div></div>
