    <h1>Ask HN: Is Anyone Else Tired of the Self Enforced Limits on AI Tech?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Like the reluctance for the folks working on DALL-E or Stable Diffusion to release their models or technology, or the whole restrictions on what it can be used for on their online services?</p><p>It makes me wonder when tech folks suddenly decided to become the morality police, and refuse to just release products in case the &#39;wrong&#39; people make use of them for the &#39;wrong&#39; purposes. Like, would we have even gotten the internet or computers or image editing programs or video hosting or what not with this mindset?</p><p>So is there anyone working in this field who isn&#39;t worried about this? Who is willing to just work on a product and release it for the public, restrictions be damned? Someone who thinks tech is best released to the public to do what they like with, not under an ultra restrictiveset of guidelines?</p></div></div></div>
