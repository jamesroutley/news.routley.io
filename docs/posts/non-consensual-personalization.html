I <em>want</em> to personalize things I use. I want to change the settings. I want to change the colors, the design, the functionality. It used to be more common that I could do this type of thing. But these days, it seems like companies want to use &#34;AI&#34; to personalize things without my consent. Instead of <em>asking</em> me what I want, they <em>decide</em> what I want.
</p>

<p>
On Netflix, I&#39;d love to change the order of the various categories. But I can&#39;t. Netflix <em>decides for me</em> what the order should be. I no longer have a choice. This kind of thing seems to be happening across products and services. It&#39;s not only commercial software, but also places like Linux and Firefox. And it&#39;s not only personalization. It used to be when I misspelled something on Google, the page would <em>ask me</em> &#34;did I mean:&#34;. But these days, Google <em>decides for me</em> what I meant. It just goes ahead and changes the search words without asking.
</p>

<p>
One very surprising exception is Mac OS, which after decades of only allowing blue controls added the choice of color. But in most ways MacOS doesn&#39;t allow me to personalize things.
</p>

<p>
These companies might argue that it&#39;s for my benefit or that it&#39;s been studied or whatever, but it doesn&#39;t matter. There&#39;s a big difference between me <em>choosing</em> to paint my room green and a corporation coming into my house in the middle of the night and painting my room green.</p>
