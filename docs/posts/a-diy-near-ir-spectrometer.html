                                                DIYing spectrometers is not new. You can make one with your phone camera, and a broken piece from a CD-ROM as a diffraction grating. There are plenty of tutorials for this online. It takes $5 to make one.
                                                </p>

                                                However, a silicon based camera (CMOS sensor) only respond up to ~1100 nm in wavelength, and this is a physical limitation —— silicon has a band gap of ~1.1 eV, and you cannot excite electron-hole pairs with wavelength longer than about ~1100 nm. So we need a different semiconductor if we want to measure any light above this wavelength. A popular choice is InGaAs, whose bandgap is tunable down to ~0.4 eV by changing content of indium versus gallium. 
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                But you probably don&#39;t want to know how much a InGaAs camera will cost you... While a silicon-based camera is as cheap as dirt these days, an <em>one-dimensional</em> InGaAs pixel array already costs upper few thousand dollars. Any full-blown IR spectrometer system goes way over $10k, with their fancy thermoelectric cooling and precision gratings (we actually have one in our lab). The reason why they are so expensive is that the target user group are scientific researchers, not consumers.

                                                Since I have been recently interested in laser optics (as a hobby) and wish to DIY some laser systems, which inevitably requires working with near-IR wavelengths (above 1100 nm), I desperately needs a way to analyze what light I&#39;m producing out of my laser crystals. One day I tried to search for InGaAs photodiodes on DigiKey and it turns out that <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/advanced-photonix/0800-3111-111/0800-3111-111-ND/10294611">a single InGaAs photodiode</a> sells for ~20 bucks. While its 100x more expensive than a silicon photodiode, I figured that you can make a spectrometer just with this one photodiode, and it&#39;s definitely within reach of DIY. And here it is —— <strong>a fiber-coupled IR spectrometer that measures from 800~1600 nm</strong>. </p>
