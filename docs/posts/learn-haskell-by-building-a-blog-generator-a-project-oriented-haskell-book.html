<p>In this book we will implement a simple static blog generator in Haskell,
converting documents written in our own custom markup language to HTML.</p>
<p>We will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implement a tiny HTML printer library</li>
<li>Define and parse our own custom markup language</li>
<li>Read files and glue things together</li>
<li>Add command line arguments parsing</li>
<li>Write tests and documentation</li>
</ol>
<p>In each chapter of the book we will focus on a particular task we wish to achieve,
and through the chapter we&#39;ll learn just enough Haskell to complete the task.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-you-read-this-book"><a href="#why-should-you-read-this-book">Why should you read this book?</a></h2>
<p>There are many Haskell tutorials, guides and books out there. Why read this one?</p>
<h3 id="pros"><a href="#pros">Pros</a></h3>
<p>There are probably more, but here are a few possible pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s <strong>relatively short</strong> - most Haskell books out there are hundreds of pages long.
This book (when exported to PDF) is roughly 150 pages long.</li>
<li>It&#39;s <strong>project oriented</strong>. Many Haskell books teach Haskell by teaching the underlying
concepts and features in a neat progression. In this book we try to build a program,
and learn Haskell on the way. This will be a pro to some, and a con to others.
There are other tutorials like this. The most notable ones are
<a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781430262510#otherversion=9781430262503">Beginning Haskell</a>
and <a href="https://haskell-via-sokoban.nomeata.de/">Haskell via Sokoban</a>.</li>
<li>It touches on <strong>important topics</strong> such as design patterns, testing and documentation.</li>
<li>It&#39;s <strong>online</strong>, which means corrections are easy to make.</li>
<li>It&#39;s <strong>free</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons"><a href="#cons">Cons</a></h3>
<p>There are probably more, but here are a few possible cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may <strong>lack depth</strong> - many, much longer Haskell tutorials are long because they go
deeper into the nuts and bolts of each feature.</li>
<li>It may <strong>not cover as many features or techniques</strong> as other tutorials -
we try to cover features as they pop up in our implementation, but we will
probably miss features that aren&#39;t as important for our tasks,
while other resources may try to cover many different use cases.</li>
<li>It is <strong>very new</strong> and not &#34;battle-tested&#34;. Who knows if this is a good approach to
learning Haskell? Maybe you could help with that!</li>
<li>It <strong>doesn&#39;t have a technical editor</strong>, making the book not as good as it could&#39;ve been.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.haskell.org/documentation/">haskell.org/documentation</a> page lists
many tutorials, books, guides and courses. You can find a few alternatives that I can
recommend <a href="https://github.com/soupi/haskell-study-plan#about-this-guide">in this list</a>.</p>
