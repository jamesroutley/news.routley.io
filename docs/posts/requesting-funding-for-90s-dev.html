    <h1>Requesting Funding for 90s.dev</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
<p>Hi everyone. A couple months ago I posted 90s.dev under the wrong title.
I called it a video game maker, because that’s the <em>vision</em> I had for it.
But I posted it prematurely, and it wasn’t yet a video game maker.
It was <em>an retro os web environment</em>, which I planned to make a game maker <em>in</em>.
So a lot of you showed interest, but I asked you to come back later.</p>
<p>Well, the problem was that I need to be monetized for my efforts on it.
I have practically no spare time due to my state and duties in life.
I <em>want</em> to work on it, but I had to focus on making money.
I was able to work on it for 3 months because I burned through <em>all my savings</em>.
Plus it’s entirely front-end code, which is inherently hard to monetize.</p>
<p>This is the age old problem of how to fund open source.</p>
<p>So I had an idea that I thought might be a good solution.
I would use GitHub Sponsors, but as a way to pay me hourly.
Instead of tiers, you would just specify an amount,
and for each $25 that I receive, I would work one hour on 90s.dev.</p>
<p>Since this would essentially be employment, I should share my resume.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>90s.dev</p>
<ul>
<li>App source: <a href="https://github.com/sdegutis/os.90s.dev">https://github.com/sdegutis/os.90s.dev</a></li>
<li>Docs source: <a href="https://github.com/sdegutis/90s.dev">https://github.com/sdegutis/90s.dev</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I spent about 3 months on it, working ~14 hours a day, 6-7 days a week.
It was my first time learning about and using most web worker features.
I had to learn about threads, broadcast channels, message ports, etc.
(At one point it used a shared worker for the file system but I took it out.)</p>
