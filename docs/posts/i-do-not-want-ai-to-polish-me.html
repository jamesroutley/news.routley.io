<p>I was sending an email when a little magic wand popped up that said <strong>“Polish”</strong> and I thought that was weird because <em>why would I want to translate my email into Polish</em>?  </p>

<p>I tried to click on it to make it go away but instead it changed the entire email because apparently it was saying that it needed to “polish” my email because I guess I’m too unsophisticated to use words:</p>

<p>There is no way in hell anyone who knows me would get that email and not think I’d been abducted so I deleted the suggested rewrite and updated my email:</p>

<p>But after I added the update gmail was like, “YOU’RE STILL DOING IT WRONG, IDIOT?” and the polish thing came up <em><strong>again</strong></em> and I was like, “Are you trying to AI fix a paragraph where I say how much I don’t want AI to fix shit?”  And turns out, yeah, that exactly what it meant because it gave me this:</p>

<p><strong>Jesus.</strong> Y’all, if you get an email from me it will be signed with HUGS, LOVE, FIGHT THE PATRIARCHY, DOWN WITH POWDERED GRAVY or SORRY I SUCK SO MUCH. It will be filled with typos and rambling parentheticals and apologies for answering several months too late. This is how you know it’s me and not a robot. My only hope is that my constant declining of the suggestions will make the AI learn from me and spread my terrible etiquette throughout the world.</p>



<p>Also, I just realized when I tried to insert these pictures into this blog about how much I hate AI my blog was suddenly like, “HEY I KNOW YOU JUST CLICKED A BUTTOM SAYING YOU WANT TO ADD A SPECIFIC PICTURE BUT HOW ABOUT WE JUST MAKE AI IMAGES FOR YOU INSTEAD?”  <strong><em>AM I ON CANDID CAMERA?</em></strong>  It’s like my whole computer is a toddler screaming “LET ME DO IT!” every time I try to create something.</p>

<p>And as much as I hate AI, I had to see what the program thought it could do so much better than me so I gave it the prompt “please stop giving me AI” and…all apologies.  Clearly I <strong><em>did</em></strong> need help because…fucking wow.  Nailed it:</p>
