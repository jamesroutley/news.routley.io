The road as well as the pavements outside the complex were littered with debris.</p><p>There was speculation that freezing temperatures of as low as -10C (14F) overnight had caused a crack in the tank, which then exploded under the weight of the water. Police said the cause was still being investigated.</p><p>Operators say the aquarium has the biggest cylindrical tank in the world that contained 1,500 tropical fish of 80 different species before the incident. The aquarium, which was last upgraded in 2020, is a big tourist attraction in Berlin. A 10-minute elevator ride through the tank was one of the highlights of the attraction.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"></figure><p>Buses were sent to the complex to provide shelter for hotel guests leaving the building.</p><p><em>Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report</em></p></div></div></div>
