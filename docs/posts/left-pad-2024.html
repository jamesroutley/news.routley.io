    <h1>Left-Pad (2024)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It&#39;s been 8 years since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_left-pad_incident">the left-pad incident</a> happened. It&#39;s been a good choice to avoid this subject for focusing on actual work. Also, silence is gold. But on the other hand, left-pad is seen as a notable event mentioned in books, so I&#39;ll share more info and thoughts about what exactly happened.</p>
<p>In most of 2016, I spent almost every weekend camping in remote areas without any signal. If you&#39;re curious how I felt when making the decision to unpublish; it was a choice made during self-reflection in nature.</p>
<p>Not driven by logic, anger, or greed.</p>
<p>And it came from a simple principle: if NPM breaks its own rules to remove one of my packages, they should remove all of them.</p>
<p>Not that I&#39;m an inflexible &#34;rules&#34; person — quite the opposite. The spirit behind the rules matter more than the rules themselves to me. In a different context, we could be asking NPM to take down a package without owner&#39;s permission for a &#34;good&#34; reason. However, in this situation, a company like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kik_Messenger">Kik Messenger</a> was just posturing and exercising power over the open source community NPM was built on, sending threats such as &#34;we&#39;ll bang on your door&#34; and &#34;take down your accounts&#34;. This is the context in which NPM went against the rules they wrote themselves, to serve something they deemed &#34;higher&#34; than the soul of their company and the community.</p>
<p>I was not afraid of Kik&#39;s threats, </p>
<p>Many people oversimplify this event, framing it as &#34;an angry man protested corporate interests&#34;. This narrative shows us three things; first, they didn&#39;t look at the dates of the emails. They don&#39;t understand the timeline. Second, they can&#39;t relate to standing your ground in a high pressure situation involving threats. And third, they haven&#39;t read Al-Ghazali yet, don&#39;t quite understand how (free) people make decisions.</p>
<p>There was nothing sudden or unexpected for NPM. I asked NPM to remove my modules, waited their response. I didn&#39;t set any deadline; NPM had the opportunity to adjust their APIs and tooling to make this transition smooth. Interestingly, they chose to provide me a script that removes all my packages at once. On the NPM side, I observed general condescending attitude towards developers, which led them make series of unreasonable decisions and ultimately blame me for all the cost.</p>
<p>Most of my open source work followed Unix philosophy, so the packages did one thing at a time. There was 350+ of them. In the surface, it looked like nobody used them. NPM didn&#39;t show usage stats, and there was almost no activity on Github. As a user, it was impossible to know the impact of unpublishing packages; but I still don&#39;t understand why NPM didn&#39;t take the time to find out if any of my modules were widely used and consider ways to handle the unpublishing without breaking anything.</p>
<h2>8 Years Later</h2>
<p>Several months after the left-pad incident, I quit my job and left US permanently, spent a year in Morocco, Jordan, Türkiye and Indonesia. I walked trails like Lycian Way, found new camping spots nobody knows about.</p>
<p>Left-pad was like a &#34;death&#34; and &#34;re-birth&#34; moment for me. The part of me passionate about open-source was dead, and something new took over. Now, I&#39;m passionate about business, marketing, running companies / teams in different ways, as much as I&#39;m about programming.</p>
<p>Life goes on.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
