<p>Even though synthesizers are musical instruments first and foremost, learning about them is easier and more intuitive if we can use our eyes to supplement our ears. Studying waveforms, frequency and time relationships, audio signals, and control voltages become clear and immediate if we can see how they change and interact, not just listen to what they’re doing. Seeing these signals come alive in full color as we patch and tweak gives our learning process a huge boost!

With its dual stereo inputs, you can study up to four signals at once, comparing and overlapping them with ease. A variety of display modes let you see your data in color, a huge advantage over the old oscilloscopes you’ve seen in science fiction movies! Its user interface is clear and quick, thanks to its dedicated menu buttons and clickable encoder knob, and its 240 x 320 pixel 2.8” color LCD is a joy to watch.</p>

To further dive into analyzing any signal, the NTS-2 also comes with a dedicated FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) mode with a real-time Spectrum Analyzer. These handy tools have always been out of reach for the synth musician because they either required expensive hardware or a nearby computer. Now you can carry them in your pocket!</p>

But the NTS-2 is much more than just an oscilloscope. The flexible Wave Generator mode has 2 oscillators with dedicated outputs, so you can test your synth rig or just get creative! Each oscillator can create a variety of waveforms – sine, square, triangle, sawtooth, pulse, and noise – whose shape and phase can be adjusted to suit many applications.

<p>The NTS-2 offers plenty of ways to connect to your studio, despite its small footprint. Besides its 4-channel input and dual waveform output features, its dual stereo THRU/OUT ports let you leave it wired into your system. It’s much easier to understand what you’re doing if you can see the signals and use them at the same time, rather than constantly plugging and unplugging cables. This handy function lets you maintain your signal flow at all times – even when the NTS-2 has been powered off.</p>

<p>As with other Nu:Tekt products, the NTS-2 is a DIY (Do It Yourself) kit that is extremely easy and quick to assemble (see assembly video below). When you open the bundle with “Patch &amp; Tweak with KORG”, you’ll find something extra: an exclusive set of transparent side panels for your NTS-2, letting it stand up at one of two different mounting angles for easy use in any studio or stage rig, as well as a BJOOKS and KORG Sticker set.</p>

<p>“PATCH &amp; TWEAK with KORG” is a detailed look at semi-modular synthesis. It is based around KORG and ARP’s popular range of patchable synthesizers – the MS-20 mini, ARP 2600 M, and volca modular, as well as the SQ-1 and SQ-64 sequencers and the NTS-2 Oscilloscope. You can explore the principles of semi-modular synthesis through these beautiful machines, and supercharge your creativity with dozens of tips, techniques, and patches. Synth novices, experienced professionals, KORG enthusiasts, and ARP lovers alike will find this book an essential resource.</p>

Going through the basic concepts of oscillators, LFOs, envelope generators, sequencing, etc., each chapter ramps up to more advanced tips and tricks. The designs and features of the different KORG semi-modular synths are explained and visualized, with clearly-labeled patch diagrams and useful color-coding that makes it easy to follow along.</p>

This book creates a deep understanding of how these instruments interface with the outside world – ideas largely unexplored in manuals and online demos. Now that you have these instruments, how do you integrate them effectively with the gear you already have? What should your next steps be to maximize their power? You’ll learn lots of these strategies, and much more.</p>
