<p>Almost everybody has had one, or even has still one of it at home. Almost everybody who had it, kept it in his/her immediate proximity while sleeping…</p>
<p>The LM8560 is the integrated circuit (IC), which was built in almost all the digital alarm clocks and clock radios, with numeric LED display, that have been produced from around 1985, or even the first 1980 years, up to the 2010 years. A very few and last models are still produced in year 2023. But they are fading out.</p>
<p>The letters before the number 8560 printed on the IC vary depending by the chip manufacturer. “LM” were used by the original manufacturer Sanyo, which was also the inventor of the chip. The letters after the number, if present, are of virtually no importance. Today some illegal clones made by Chinese manufacturers are labeled with “LM”, but they are not the original by Sanyo and I have no idea about the quality and durability of these chips.</p>
<p>The modern alarm clocks with LED display are made with micro controller chips. I will show it later.</p>
<p><span><strong>– Why am I talking here about this ‘obsolete’ chip?</strong></span></p>
<p>Because it had its debut in the early or mid 1980s and it is one of the few things from those years that has survived intact to this day, still working. This chip played an important role in the falling of price of the digital alarm clocks.</p>


<h2 id="alarm_clocks_before_it"><strong>– What digital alarm clocks before it were like</strong></h2>


<p>Until the late 1970s and early 1980s, digital alarm clocks were somewhat more challenging cost devices than today. “Digital” doesn’t mean necessarily “electronic”. It means that the time is show actively by digits and not by hands.</p>
<p>re LEDs became more affordable, the alarm clocks with luminous digits were made using fluorescent displays, like the displays of many DVD-Blu Ray players of today, or many Hi-Fi sets. Usually the fluorescent display used in alarm clocks had a light greenish color. Fluorescent displays were, and are, much more expensive to build and complicate to drive than LEDs. In addition, alarm clocks counted the time mostly using a quartz crystal. Often the word “Quartz” was printed proudly on the case of the clock. The control circuit of the display and the quartz circuit involved some construction complexity and a significant number of components. The lower price for a clock radio in the early 1980s was not cheap. Let’s say about €70 today. The size of the alarm clocks was also considerably larger.</p>

<p>Clocks of this kind never appealed me. They tastes too much “mechanical” and rudimentary, whereas I like electronic since ever.</p>
<p>Before LEDs became more affordable, the alarm clocks with luminous digits were made using fluorescent displays, like the displays of many DVD-Blu Ray players of today, or many Hi-Fi sets. Usually the fluorescent display used in alarm clocks had a light greenish color. Fluorescent displays were, and are, much more expensive to build and complicate to drive than LEDs.

The lower price for a clock radio in the early 1980s was not cheap. Let’s say about €70 today. The size of the alarm clocks was also considerably larger.</p>
<p>With the progress of electronics and the decreasing price of LEDs, the LM8560 came. A less than half a Euro chip (adjusted to today inflation), that contains all the functions you need to build a basic digital alarm clock. You just need some LEDs to arrange the display and very few external components around it. The radio is to be added separately, if needed.</p>


<h2 id="how_it_works"><strong>– Why is the LM8560 so cost effective? The trick, how it works</strong></h2>


<p>The LM8560 is not a programmed micro controller. In the ’80s programmable micro controllers were no cheap ware at all.</p>

<p>Being not a programmed micro controller, the LM8560 is also a virtually eternal component. Many modern micro controllers incorporate a flash memory to store the software that let the controller work and execute the desired functions. Flash memories retain their content not for an unlimited lifespan. It may be several decades, but before or later it comes the day when they begin to lose their content, and the micro controller stops to work. This can’t happen to LM8560, because it doesn’t contain any flash memory.</p>
<p>An electronic clock consists essentially of 2 different parts. A frequency generator, that generates a stable frequency and one part counts the waves coming from the generated frequency. Counting the waves that pass, the passing of seconds is counted. In quartz watches, the frequency generator is a quartz oscillator. In addition, if you want obtain a very good accuracy in quartz clocks, it is necessary to add some components to make the quartz frequency adjustable. A calibration process has to be performed individually during the manufacturing of each clock. This increases the time and cost for the workers needed for the manufacturing.</p>
<p>The alarm clocks with LCD displays, even those from the ’80s years, are instead quartz-based, like the wristwatches, and they use different components.</p>
<p>An important function integrated in the LM8560 is the power backup system. It keeps the time running in the event of a power blackout. It is made switching the power supply of the chip to a 9V battery. During the blackout, a local simple RC (resistance-capacitor) oscillator is used. The frequency generated by the RC oscillator is very approximated, up to +/-10% error. It means that while the AC power is missing, the clock can run forwards or backwards up to 1 minute every 10 minutes! If the AC power is missing for a long time, it is normal to find the time several minutes shifted. It seems that the LM8560 was the first IC clock to incorporate this important function, making it a very smart and convenient chip. Only the resistance and the capacitor for the backup oscillator, are required to be mounted externally to the chip.</p>


<h2 id="typical_issues"><strong>– Typical Issues of clocks with the LM8560</strong></h2>


<p>You might experience that some clocks with the LM8560 may run too fast in comparison with other clocks, also with the LM8560. Cheap models are more subjected to this fault. It is due to the missing of proper filtering on the 50/60Hz input signal for the LM8560. Spikes and disturbs present in the AC line can be wrongly counted as clock waves by the chip. Just add a 0,1 or 01,01 µF ceramic capacitor in parallel to each rectifier diode of the power supply of the clock, and one between the pin 25 (50/60Hz input) and pin 15 (VSS) of the LM8560.</p>
<p>If power blackouts are frequent in your zone and your alarm clock runs excessively fast or too slow while there is no AC power, you can fix it easy. Simply adjust with a trimmer the value of the resistor that is in parallel to the capacitor of the backup oscillator (see the datasheet), in order to obtain a frequency of exact 900 Hz, or adjust it simply by trying. You can roughly calculate the required Ohm variation in %, observing how many seconds the time gets shifted in 1 or few minutes without power.</p>


<h2 id="its_weak_point_is_also_its_strength"><strong>– Its weak point is also its strength</strong></h2>


<p>As mentioned before, the LM8560 merely counts the waves of the AC power. But there is nothing that lets it know whether the waves are coming exactly 50 times per second or not. If 100 waves would come per second, the clock would run forwards half an hour every hour!</p>
<p>As first, if you want to know, without opening it, whether your alarm clock is built with the chip LM8560, just check some of these points:</p>
<p>1) The display is strictly 4-digits LEDs, not with liquid crystals.</p>





<p><strong>The hidden key combinations:</strong></p>
<p>1) Display seconds: Hold down the “Alarm” button and press “Sleep”. Or do vice-versa as well. Then you can release one of the 2 buttons. On the left side of the display, the digit of the minute units is shown. On the right part, the seconds runs. This is my favorite function and no manufacturer of alarm clocks has ever implemented a dedicated button to display the seconds. All this to save few Eurocents on the final cost. I modified my clock radio, so I can keep the seconds displayed as long as I want, and it is very convenient to adjust the clock, second accurately.</p>
<p>2) While displaying seconds, press the “Hour” button: the seconds will be set to zero. If you press it between the 30-59th second, the minute will be increased by one.</p>
<p>3) While displaying seconds, press the “Minute” button: the time stops! This function is also very useful to align the clock, seconds accurately.</p>
<p>4) While displaying seconds, press both the “Hour” and “Minute” buttons at the same time:</p>
<p>5) Hold down the “Time” (or “Clock”) button and then keep pressed “Hours” and “Minutes” together: both hours and minutes increase at the same time at the rate of 2 digits per second. This is useful if you need to set up the clock time from zero, when you are in a time with high digits numbers.</p>
<p>6) Hold down “Alarm” and then press “Hour” and “Minute” together: the alarm time is set to 0:00</p>
<p>7) Hold down “Sleep” and then press “Hours”: the timer for the radio sets to 1 hour and 59 minutes, the max possible time for the sleep function. This setting possibility sometime is written in the user manual, sometimes not.</p>
<p>One thing I didn’t notice, and I always missed to read in the user manual, is that to turn off the alarm until the next day, just press the “Alarm” button (my clock radio had no dedicated “Alarm reset” button). Instead, I used to move the alarm selector back to the OFF position and then moving it again to the Alarm position, every day. So if anyone else missed it, just press the Alarm button, or the “Alarm reset” if present.</p>


<h2 id="some_unwanted_behaviors"><strong>And some unwanted behaviors…</strong></h2>


<p>Due to the way how the buttons are wired to the LM8560 on the most clocks, the clocks with this chip have also some unwanted behaviors. Behaviors that can have unpleasant consequences, when the next day the alarm clock has to wake you!</p>
<p>1) Hold down the “Hour” button and then press “Alarm”. You would expect that only the hours of the alarm time get increased. In reality, the hours of the clock time increase too!</p>
<p>2) Hold down the “Minute” key and then press “Alarm”. The minutes of the clock increase too!</p>
<p>3) The same happens if you hold down the “Minute” or “Hour” button and then press “Sleep”.</p>
<p>4) When the alarm rings (buzzer or radio), independently by whether you have already temporarily snoozed it, press the Sleep button and then the Snooze button. The alarm will be deactivated completely, until the next day. As if you press the Alarm or “Alarm reset” button! This seems to be a bug or “feature” of the chip itself. It is not related to the wiring of the buttons. Therefore, be carefully what keys you press, when you want just snooze the alarm!</p>
<p>5) When you press the Snooze button after that you have already snoozed the alarm, the snooze timer resets. Example: The alarm rings at 8:00 and you snooze it immediately. The alarm now is silenced and it would ring again at 8:09. But if at 8:08 you press the snooze button, it will ring again at 8:17, not at 8:09! Bug or feature, keep it in mind.</p>


<h2 id="the_evil_buzzer"><strong>Technical curiosities</strong></h2>


<p><strong>The evil beep beep!</strong></p>
<p>I hope no one really uses to wake up that evil loud and crazy unpleasant beep! beep! buzzer. A friend of mine didn’t know that you could also wake up listening the radio, and for years he had kept the alarm switch on that evil beep set, instead of the radio! But where did that beep come from? That beep is the same in all radio alarm clocks with the LM8560 and it has a frequency of 900 Hz. This frequency is generated by the RC oscillator that is used for the power back up system.</p>


<h2 id="Limitations_of_use"><strong>– Limitations of use</strong></h2>


<p>Clocks based on counting the frequency of the AC power are not suitable to operate in places where the AC voltage does not come directly from the fixed national power grid. For example, portable emergency generators, camping generators, or large UPS power backup system, which have no active control over frequency changes over time. The alarm clock will therefore tend to shift the time by several minutes in a few hours. The could happens onboard ships. Who takes one of these alarm clocks on a cruise could do the experiment. Just synchronize it with a wristwatch and check after a few hours or days, how much the time will be shifted.</p>


<h2 id="Quartz_clock_with_LM8560"><strong>– Make a quartz clock of it</strong></h2>


<p>You can make a quartz clock using an LM8560, by adding a small circuit which contains the quartz oscillator and a frequency divisor, which downclocks the quartz frequency to 50 or 60Hz, the value that the LM8560 expects to count. You can do it using a quartz with frequency 3,579 MHz and the frequency divisor IC MM5369, as shown in<strong> <a href="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Clock_with_LM8365_and_quartz.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this diagram</a> </strong>of a clock built with the LM8365, where the pin 36 is the input of the 50/60Hz frequency.</p>
<p>Once you have added a quartz, It is also possible to feed the clock directly with DC power supply, if you need. You have to add 2 or 3 transistors to use the 50/60 Hz clock signal generated by the quartz, to switch the DC power alternately between the two groups of cathodes of the duplex display. If the segments are not displayed correctly, exchange the 2 lines to the display.</p>


<h2 id="operating_modes"><strong>– Operating modes</strong></h2>


<p>The LM8560 cm be set to display the time in 12 or 24 hour format, and it can be set to count the time using an AC power frequency of 50Hz (as in Europe) or 60 Hz (as in north America). These settings are made by adding or not, bridges to the related pins of the LM8560.</p>


<h2 id="relatives_and_predecessors"><strong>– Its relatives and predecessors</strong></h2>


<p>The LM8560 has a family of important predecessors, but these have been dropped almost immediately in favor of the 8560. This was the MM53xx family, such as the MM5309 or the -11-12-13-14-15. All of these chips (except I think the MM5312) had the interesting ability to control 6-digit displays, so the seconds could be displayed together with hours and minutes on the display.</p>


<h2 id="duplex_display"><strong>– The duplex Display. A not versatile but clever solution</strong></h2>


<p>This is where it gets a little too technical, and only the electronics hobbyists may be interested in. I try to explain the important points in a simple way, for those who want to know a little more about how this duplex LED display works, that was so popular in alarm clocks.</p>
<p>The LM8560’s display works differently than the numerical LED displays found commonly in other appliances, where the digits are “multiplexed”. The display which works with the LM8560 is a custom-made display for this chip. It is a so called “Duplex” display. It is a smart solution for the industrial manufacturing of alarm clocks, but it makes the LM8560 not suitable for the hobbyists who want to build a their own alarm clock using a standard LED display. Let’s see why.</p>
<p>Normally, the numeric LED displays with more than one digit, are driven using the Multiplex system. The digits are not lighted all together at the same time. They are lighted in turn one at once, just for a fraction of a second each one. After the first digit has been turned off, the second digit is turned on. It is repeated in cycle through all the digits. The process happens so fast that the eye sees the digits as all lit on, but they aren’t.</p>
<p>With the multiplexing, regardless of how many digits the display has, the chip needs to have only 7 output pins to drive the 7 segments for a single digit. All the digits are connected to these same 7 outputs. Just a few output pins more are needed to select the digit to be lighted on. The Multiplex circuit, built inside the chip, connect the power supply only to the digit that has to be lighted during its turn, while all the other digits will be disconnected from power.</p>
<p>Using only 4 digits, the LM8560 in order to reduce the number of the output connections to the display, uses a low-cost, ‘smart’ 2-phases multiplexing system. The 4 digits are not turned on/off one at a time. The whole display is divided in only two groups of segments, spread among all the 4 digits. </p>

<p><em>Thanks to the Mousa Simple Projects blog for this diagram</em></p>
<p>Please note that in this project the clock is feed with DC power and the 50Hz clock signal is generate by a RC oscillator, therefore it will be not accurate and it will be subjected to variations also due to the tolerances of the RC components. For a better accuracy a quartz oscillator is needed (see the paragraph “<a href="#Quartz_clock_with_LM8560">Make a quartz clock of it</a>” above).</p>
<p>Here there are two schematics of the duplex display which is commonly used with the LM8560:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Duplex_Display_schematic1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Duplex_Display_schematic1.jpg" alt="" width="294" height="202"/></a>                                   <a href="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Duplex_Display_schematic2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Duplex_Display_schematic2_small.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="200"/></a></p>
<p>Here you can find a PCB in editable form, where you can modify the layout of the connections to fit the LEDs that you want use: . <a href="https://oshwlab.com/Trajectory/tests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://oshwlab.com/Trajectory/tests</a>    If you login in that site you can also export the PCB in <strong>svg</strong> format.</p>
<p>The 2 groups of segments are switched on/off alternately, accordingly to the half-waves coming from the transformer (50 or 60 Hz) transformer. Therefore no additional components are required to select and drive the on/off switching of the digits.</p>
<p>As you can see in the images bottom, taken with a shutter speed shorter than 1/00 sec., you can clearly see the two groups of segments that compose the digits. Despite the appearances they, are never turned on all together.</p>

<h2 id="not_the_best_chip_for_hobbyists"><strong>Not the best chip for the electronics hobbyists</strong></h2>


<p>Requiring a single block specific duplex display, the LM8560 is not the best clocks’ chip for the electronic hobbyists. The Duplex display for the LM8560 is discontinued, it is almost impossible to find as spare part for sale today, and it can’t be replaced with standard 7-segments display modules with common cathode. In the standard modules, the cathodes of all segments of a digit are connected together. You can’t recreate the internal connections among the segments as they are in the duplex display, because the cathode of some segments of a digit has to be connected with the cathode of a segments of another digit. To do this, you need a display modules in which all the segments have their anodes and cathodes free, not connected in common. But such digits modules do not exist, as far I know.</p>
<p>Another problem for the hobbyists is that the package of the LM8560 is a shrink package. In order to reduce the space occupied on the boards of small clocks, the spacing of the pins of the LM8560 is 1,78mm, not 2,54mm as the common standard. It means that the pins of the LM8560 don’t fit in the standard 28pin sockets or in the pre-holed boards. But if you make a custom board for your circuit, this is not a problem. Sockets with spacing 1,78mm are today extremely hard to find, if you want mount it on a socket.</p>


<h2 id="my_alarm_clocks"><strong>My alarm clocks</strong></h2>


<p><strong>– An advice first: Why red LED displays are my favorite:</strong></p>
<p>For stupid trend reasons, red LED displays are disappearing, being replaced by other colors, such as green and even worse, blue. Since 2007 Sony produces no more alarm clocks with red LED display. Red LEDs were the first to have been invented and for a long time, red was also the only LED color available. Only because of that reason, red LEDs are perceived today as something “retro”, but in alarm clocks the red color has also its own functionality.</p>


<h2 id="my_first_clock_radio"><strong>My first clock radio, by Majestic 1986</strong></h2>


<p>As mentioned before, thanks to the LM8560 the price of clock radios dropped. In the mid 1980s some supermarkets even offered a clock radio as prize for the collection of their purchase-points. Back then, prizes for purchase points were normally something boring, like a set of glasses, cups, or dishes with table baskets. They were no electronic gadgets. A digital clock radio appeared like a super cool and technological prize! Never seen before. It seemed impossible that they could give a so much electronic device “for free”.</p>
<p><em>Maximal 8688 (same as Majestic)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Maximal_8688.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Maximal_8688.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="244"/></a></p>
<p>Arrived at home, as soon as I checked that it worked, I opened it to see what it looked like inside. I remember the disappointment seeing that the clock was made with only a single chip, with few other components around it (apart the radio section), and without a quartz, which I liked much to have. Quartz back then were a symbol of precision and anything with a quartz built in, looked to be prestigious! Today with 15 € you can buy a radio-controlled clock, constantly synchronized via radio with an atomic clock, which is accurate to one millionth of a second.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Maximal_8688_open.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Maximal_8688_open_small.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="250"/></a></strong></p>
<p>One day, talking with the owner of a little electronics shop about my disappointment that my new alarm clock had no quartz inside, he said to me, “But what? As prize for the supermarket points did you wanted a quartz radio clock?! It counts the 50Hz and let’s go! It’s already much if they gave it!”</p>
<p>This glorious clock radio lasted in service until 1998. In the meantime, I played with the keys so much that after 11 years, the paint and marks were completely worn and the black plastic underneath had been completely exposed. </p>


<h2 id="Sony_ICF-C102"><strong>Sony ICF-C102</strong></h2>


<p>Compared to the Sony’s clock radios (my sister got already one) the audio quality of the Majestic was poorer. I still didn’t knew, that the blame was of low quality speaker, rather than of the radio. So I decided to afford a Sony too, and doing that, my alarm clock odyssey began, and lasted until August 2007, right before my departure from Italy.</p>
<p>The first Sony clock radio I purchased was a cube-shaped model with green LED display. The Digicube ICF-C102. I wanted experiment the green LED trend too:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Sony_ICF-C102.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Sony_ICF-C102_small.jpg" alt="" width="456" height="250"/></a></strong></p>
<p>I brought it home, and after verifying that it worked, I opened it to see what there was inside. Given the price of more than twice as much as a ‘budged’ clock radio, I was sure that all the Sony’s clock radios were based on a quartz clock… Instead not… I opened it and the clock was made with the chip LM8365. It works with the same principle of the LM8560, counting the AC frequency, but it drives a standard 7-segments display with multiplexing. I think to remember, that the flickering of the display was in some conditions, somewhat more perceivable than on the clocks with the LM8560. Also once again, this was not the time to get a quartz clock radio.</p>
<p>Beside this surprise, I noticed that its green display, behind the dark glass, was much less bright than the red display of the destroyed Majestic, and during the daytime it was less readable. Instead, at night I had the surprise that the green light illuminates well my whole room! And even worst, I noticed that <strong>the radio is never completely switched off!!!</strong> I place my alarm clock very close to the bed, practically almost sticking to my head. When the radio was switched off, it was actually switched on, just kept with the volume set to minimum. If you put the speaker in proximity of your ear, you can distinctly hear the music from the radio station in the background, in addition to the background hiss that is always present when the volume is set to zero! During the daytime you can’t hear it, but in the night, in a silent room, you hear it clearly, if the clock is not enough distant from your head.</p>
<p>To me, as an electronic technician, this is an absurd design choice beyond any reason. I guess that the reason for this absurd choice is to don’t let you hear that classic small “stock!” noise, when you switch on/off the radio, that is usually audible in clock radios where the radio is completely turned of when it is not in use.</p>
<p>The audio quality of the radio was high as expected. It mounted the famous radio chip <strong>Sony CXA1019S</strong>, mounted also in some small good portable radios by Sony, like the ICF-380 (the ICF-12 had a similar IC). The buttons were real micro switch buttons, not like those hard to press, that you find on the cheap alarm clocks. But the issue with the radio never turned off was so deleterious, that after 1 or 2 months trying to live with it, I placed that clock radio in another room, and I bought another one.</p>
<p>Given the good sound quality of the radio, I wanted try with another Sony, but this time I switched back to the red display, forever. I choose this time a more classic model, not a cube. I thought that Sony engineers were not so stupid to handle the turning off of the radio, in the same way on all Sony’s models…</p>


<h2 id="Sony ICF-C290"><strong>My second and last Sony was the ICF-C290</strong></h2>


<p>It was still in the year 1998</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Sony_ICF-290.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Sony_ICF-290_small.jpg" alt="" width="438" height="193"/></a></p>
<p>The audio quality of the radio was good as expected. The radio chip was the same Sony <strong>CXA1019S</strong>, as in the Digicube ICF-C102. But <strong>also in this clock radio, the radio is never completely turned off!</strong> It is just kept at the minimum volume. And <strong>also here there is no LED dot that indicates that the alarm function is inserted!</strong> Looking closely at the display, the spot of the dot was present, so I drove the 10Km back to the store, thinking that my clock radio was faulty. The clerk tested it on the same model exhibited on the shelf, and also that one show no alarm dot. The clerk was quite surprised too.</p>
<p>Then I drove back to home, I opened the clock radio, and what was inside? The LM8560, as in my 11 years older supermarket clock radio prize! I was astonished. The giant Sony Company bought that low cost IC from Sanyo, instead to develop an its own custom clock IC, as they did with the IC of the radio?</p>
<p>Since the audio quality was really good and I didn’t want an LCD clock radio, I modified the Sony ICF-C290 by myself, as the best I could do at that time. I made a hole in the front panel and I added a LED that indicates the activation of the alarm. I added a small reed relay that disconnected the speaker when the radio was off.</p>
<p>But this is not the end of the story… After a few years the radio began to have tuning problems. I find that the variable capacitor of the radio was made of poor material and oxide has formed between the blades, and on the rotating contact. Right in a Sony, which should use only high quality components…</p>


<h2 id="Thomson_CR61"><strong>Thomson CR61, my final clock radio</strong></h2>


<p>In August 2007 I was now in the mid of preparations for my moving to Germany and I had to look once again for a clock radio… I went around a lot of stores and with red display there were only very budget models, very cheap, very low quality and of unknown brands. Then in a big store I saw the Thomson CR61. I didn’t like much that model aesthetically, because I don’t like rounded shapes, but it seemed to be solid and well made. I could feel that the buttons were made, as usual on the budged clocks, with big slats bounded with adhesive plastic film. But they were very good to use. Too bad it didn’t have two alarm times, but by that time I knew well that I need a red display, so I picked it bought it. Price was 30€. Not a budged model, and not a Sony.</p>





<p>It was also the only model remained with a design still focused on functionality. For example, the buttons are good spaced between each other and are not grouped in a single circular mess of buttons, as it was trendy in those years. Much to my surprise, the audio quality of the radio is really good as the Sony! It lacks a bit in the bass tones, but the sound is really very clear and detailed.</p>
<p>A remarkable safety feature of this model, is that the transformer has a 120°C thermal fuse built in. In case of overheating due to a short circuit, internally or externally to the transformer, it interrupts the AC supply. A very good feature for a device that stays plugged in all the time.</p>
<p>I modded the clock radio so that I can keep the seconds displayed permanently. I added only a switch which keeps the “Sleep” button pressed. If you keep the “Alarm” button pressed instead, the alarm will not ring,</p>
<p>Finally, I promised myself that this will be my last clock radio and I will never threw it away! It is so well made and functional to me, that I bought other 3 pieces of the same model as replacement, to be sure it will last forever.</p>


<h2 id="the_modern_clock_radios"><strong>The modern clock radios</strong></h2>


<p>The modern clock radios in year 2023, also the most cheap models with LED display, are made with a PLL tuner made with SDR technology. There is no more mixer, intermediate frequency, etc… The radio frequency is directly sampled and completely digitally processed and demodulated. The processor unit has 10 or 20 memories for the stations. Cool, but it is made just to save the costs of the variable capacitor and other components. Like all the cheap SDR tuner, the have very low selectivity, low sensitivity and low audio quality.</p>
<p>I bought one of those modern cheap clock radios, just to see what there is inside.</p>
<p><span><strong>iCES ICR-210</strong> </span>(22€ in year 2023)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Ices_ICR-210.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.tycospages.com/tycospageswp1/wp-content/uploads/Ices_ICR-210.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="175"/></a></p>
<p>It looks fine, but the audio quality is poor. It has a very cheap digital SDR tuner. The quality of the tuner is quite poor too. The 10 memories for the radio stations are not comfortable to manage. The clock can’t display seconds, but it has 2 alarm times.</p>





<p>It is not a clock with radio. It is a display with integrated clock and radio. 3 ICs mounted on a mini board, with a bunch of SMD components. That’s all! If the display or the clock IC fails, you have to throw away al.</p>
<p>The only good note. When disconnected from the AC power it sucks almost no current from the 3V (2xAAA size) backups battery. Only 4µA! It means that you can leave it unplugged for the whole time and plug it only when you need it. Being a quartz clock, it will not run faster or slower than when it is powered by the AC.</p>

<p>On the back side there is finally the quartz, which generates the clock frequency for the micro controller. But now it is too late for my wish from the ’80s about a quartz clock radio. Now I prefer the eternal LM8560…</p>
