    <h1>The US military launched 500M needles into space (2019)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/northernlights.jpg"><img src="http://www.todayifoundout.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/northernlights-340x226.jpg" alt="northernlights" width="340" height="226"/></a>In the early 1960s, international communications were limited to transmissions through undersea cables or occasionally unreliable radio signals bounced off of the ionosphere. As you might imagine from this, many in the Western world weren’t too keen on the state of the situation given that were to someone, say, the Soviet Union, cut those cables before launching an attack, international communications with overseas forces and foreign allies would have to rely on the mood of said ionosphere.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, the ionosphere is a layer of the upper atmosphere about 50 to 600 miles above sea level. It gets its name because it is ionized consistently by solar and cosmic radiation. In very simple terms, X-ray, ultraviolet, and shorter wavelengths of radiation given off by the Sun (and from other cosmic sources) release electrons in this layer of the atmosphere when these particular photons are absorbed by molecules. Because the density of molecules and atoms is quite low in the ionosphere (particularly in the upper layers), it allows free electrons to exist in this way for a short period of time before ultimately recombining. Lower in the atmosphere, where the density of molecules is greater, this recombination happens much faster.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with communication and radio waves?  Without interference, radio waves travel in a straight line from the broadcast source, ultimately hitting the ionosphere.  What happens after is dependent on a variety of factors, notable among them being the frequency of the waves and the density of the free electrons.  For certain types of radio waves, given the right conditions, they will essentially bounce back and forth between the ground and the ionosphere, propagating the signal farther and farther. So clearly the ionosphere can potentially play an important part in the terrestrial radio and communication process. But it is the constantly shifting nature of the ionosphere that makes things really interesting. And for that, we’ll have to get a little more technical, though we’ll at the least spare you the math, and we’ll leave out a little of the complexity in an effort to not go full textbook on you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ionosphere_Layers.png"><img src="http://www.todayifoundout.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ionosphere_Layers-340x213.png" alt="Ionosphere_Layers" width="340" height="213" srcset="https://www.todayifoundout.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ionosphere_Layers-340x213.png 340w, https://www.todayifoundout.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ionosphere_Layers.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px"/></a>To begin with, the ionosphere’s composition changes most drastically at night, primarily because, of course, the Sun goes missing for a bit. Without as abundant a source of ionizing rays, the D and E levels (pictured right) of the ionosphere cease to be very ionized, but the F region (particularly F2) still remains quite ionized. Further, because the atmosphere is significantly less dense here then the E and D regions, it results in more free electrons (the density of which is key here).</p>
<p>When these electrons encounter a strong radio wave of certain types, such as AM radio, they can potentially oscillate at the frequency of the wave, taking some of the energy from the radio wave in the process.  With enough of them, as can happen in the F layer, (when the density of encountered electrons is sufficient relative to the specific signal frequency), and assuming they don’t just recombine with some ion (which is much more likely in the E and D layers in the daytime), this can very effectively refract the signal back down to Earth at sufficient strength to be picked up on a receiver.</p>
<p>Depending on conditions, this process can potentially repeat several times with the signal bouncing down to the ground and back up.  Thus, using this skywave certain radio signals can be propagated even thousands of miles and, most pertinent to the topic at hand, across oceans.</p>
<p>Of course, given the unpredictability of this form of communication, and potentially even times when communication would be impossible, military brass during the Cold War wanted another option.</p>
<p>Developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Labs, the project was initially called “Project Needles” by Professor Walter E. Morrow in 1958 when he first dreamed up the idea. It was later re-named “West Ford”, presumably after <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=map+westford+massachusetts&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x89e3bdbb5478fbbf:0xc3965e515c48fa04,Westford,+MA&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=Gn7uUd_ILovlyAHl7oDADg&amp;ved=0CCwQ8gEwAA">Westford, Massachusetts</a>, a nearby town. The idea was to place potentially even billions of tiny (1.78 centimeters 0.7 inches long and microscopically thin) copper antennae or dipoles in a <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/OrbitsCatalog/">medium Earth orbit</a> to be used for communication signals at 8 Ghz.</p>
<p>The first set of well over a hundred million needles was launched on October 21, 1961, but unfortunately this test failed when the needles didn’t disperse as planned.</p>
<p>On a second attempt in May 9, 1963, a batch of <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1963-014A-01">350 million needles</a> was placed on the back of an Air Force satellite and sent into orbit. Once dispersed, properly this time, the needles spread to form a sparsely concentrated belt with approximately 50 dipoles per cubic mile.</p>
<p>While you might think surely this wouldn’t be dense enough to be effective for use in communication, in fact early results of the experiment were extremely promising, with communication established using the needle array from California to Massachusetts, some 3K or so miles or 4,800 km apart.  As such, there were reports that the Air Force was considering launching two more belts to be placed more permanently in orbit.</p>
<p>There was a problem, however. Beyond the Soviets, allies and even Americans opposed the further deployment and continuance of this program.</p>
<p>Why? <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/space/terrill.pdf">Astronomers</a>, in particular, were afraid that the belt would interfere with their observations. The outrage of scientists and the reason for it was perhaps best expressed by Sir Bernard Lovell of the Jodrell Bank Radio Observatory who said: “The damage lies not with this experiment alone, but with the attitude of mind which makes it possible without international agreement and safeguards.”  After all, the space above the Earth is not the United States’ alone to do with as it pleases without consulting other nations of Earth.</p>
<p>While you might consider this a bit of an overreaction, it’s important to understand the context here, with the U.S. up to and around this point having done a series of things in space without oversight that the international community was more than a little upset about. For example, consider that also smack dab in the middle of this time, the United States was busy accidentally nuking Britain’s first satellite, among many, many others.</p>
<p>The satellite in question was the Ariel-1, which was developed as a joint-venture between the United States and Britain, with Britain designing and building the core systems of the satellite and NASA launching it into orbit via a Thor-Delta rocket.</p>
<p>Around nine months after the launch of the first batch of needles, on July 9, 1962, mere weeks after Ariel-1 was put into orbit and had successfully begun transmitting data about the ionosphere back to Earth, British scientists were shocked when the sensors aboard Ariel-1 designed to measure radiation levels suddenly began to give wildly high readings.</p>
<p>As it turned out, as Ariel-1 was happily free-falling around the Earth, the US military had decided to detonate an experimental 1.4 megaton nuclear weapon named Starfish-Prime in the upper atmosphere as part of Project Fish Bowl.</p>
<p>The explosion, which happened on the other side of the planet to Ariel-1, sent a wave of additional radiation around the Earth that ultimately damaged some of the systems on Ariel-1, particularly its solar panels, killing it and about 1/3 of the rest of the satellites in low-Earth orbit at the time.</p>
<p>Most pertinent to the topic of communications, this famously included the Telstar satellite, which was the first commercial communication relay satellite designed to transmit signals across the Atlantic and managed around 400 such communications before the U.S. accidentally nuked it. Funny enough, the Telstar actually wasn’t in orbit at the time of the explosion, being put there the day after the Starfish-Prime detonation.  However, the additional ionizing radiation created by the explosion took years to dissipate and was not anticipated by the designers of this particular satellite. The immediate result being the degradation of Telstar’s systems, particularly the failure of several transistors in the command system, causing it to stop working just a few months after being placed in orbit. They were eventually able to get it back online for a short period via some clever software workarounds, but it didn’t last thanks to the extra radiation further degrading its systems.</p>
<p>It’s also noteworthy here that The Starfish explosion was actually supposed to have happened a couple weeks earlier on June 20th, but the rocket carrying it failed at about 30,000 feet. Once this happened, the self-destruct on the nuclear warhead was initiated and it broke apart, raining its radioactive innards down on Johnston and Sand Islands, as well as in the ocean around them.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the effects of Starfish-Prime weren’t just limited to low orbit.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this, the needles in space, and other such projects had many in the international community concerned with the lack of any oversight on the United States’ activities in space. (Presumably it would have been even worse had everyone realized the United States had,<a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/10/the-united-states-once-planned-on-nuking-the-moon/"> a few years before this, planned to nuke the moon, more or less just because they could</a>…)</p>
<p>Going back to the needle issue, a compromise measure was reached thanks to incorporating a sort of <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1444922&amp;isnumber=31060">planned obsolescence</a>; that is, none of the needles would remain in orbit longer than five years. (Or so they thought, more on this in a bit.)</p>
<p>Thinking more long term, several groups of scientists, including the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) demanded access and consultation in this and other such projects in the future. Ultimately an agreement was reached which granted the scientists the ability to participate in the planning and evaluation of space projects.</p>
<p>Of course, this particular issue quickly became moot as shortly after the second group of needles was dispersed, the military deployed its own first communication satellite system in 1966, making the needle system, while effective, obsolete. With this deployment of one object instead of hundreds of millions, the furor died down and people, for the most part, forgot about West Ford.</p>
<p>That said, while the project is largely forgotten, its effects are not with the consultation provisions of the original West Ford agreement with the IAU included in the <a href="http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/outerspt.html">Outer Space Treaty of 1967</a>, an agreement entered into by ninety-nine countries, that was designed to protect against the militarization and degradation of outer space. Among other things, in a nutshell, it provides that no country can claim ownership of space nor any celestial bodies; all countries will avoid contaminating both and are liable for any damage they cause; no weapons of mass destruction (WMD) will be deployed or placed in orbit or on any celestial body; and no military bases may be placed on any celestial bodies, including the Moon, something that unfortunately saw a planned military installation by the U.S. fully scrapped, as we covered in our article: <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2019/05/that-time-the-u-s-was-going-to-build-a-massive-death-ray-equipped-military-moon-base/">That Time the U.S. was Going to Build a Massive, Death Ray Equipped, Military Moon Base</a>.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the treaty also includes a <a href="http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/gares/html/gares_21_2222.html">Good Samaritan law</a> that provides that astronauts are “envoys of mankind in outer space and [all] shall render to them all possible assistance in the event of accident, distress, or emergency landing.”</p>
<p>Going back to the needles, in case you’re wondering, despite the planned obsolescence, as of 2019, a few dozen clumps of them <a href="http://www.infosatellites.com/westfordneedles-satellite-tracking-norad-2431.html">remain in orbit</a> and are closely tracked to make sure they don’t cause any problems with all the other stuff floating around our little beautiful home space craft known as Earth.</p>

<li>Given AM radio signals can propagate for thousands of miles via the aforementioned skywaves, particularly at night, this can become a major problem as there are only a little over 100 allowed AM radio frequencies (restricted to keep signals interfering too much with one another), but around 5,000 AM radio stations in the United States alone. As a result, at night, AM stations in the United States typically reduce their power, go off the air completely until sunrise the next day, and/or possibly are required to use directional antennas so their specific signal doesn’t interfere with other stations on the same frequency. On the other hand, FM stations don’t have to do any of this as the ionosphere doesn’t greatly affect their signals, which has the side benefit (or disadvantage, depending on your point of view) of severely limiting the range of the FM signals, which rely on groundwave propagation.</li>
<li>Speaking of Radio and space, while not a job ever mentioned by my school career counselor, it turns out “Space DJ” is a thing, if you work at NASA, going all the way back to 1965 during the Gemini 6 mission on December 16th, likely initially as a joke. During this mission, astronauts Walter Schirra and Tom Stafford were woken up by a recording of singer Jack Jones and <em>Hello Dolly</em>. This musical wake-up call quickly became a regular occurrence intended as a way of bolstering morale while allowing astronauts a few minutes to wake up slowly before having to respond to ground control. Over the years, wake-up calls became one of NASA’s most beloved traditions, with the role of picking the songs given to the mission’s Capsule Commander (CAPCOM)… Yes, just to be clear, not only do these people get to put CAPCOM for NASA on their resume, but they can also add in “Space DJ”. Thanks Career Councilor…</li>
