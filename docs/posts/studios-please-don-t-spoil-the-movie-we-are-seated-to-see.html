Enjoy.</p><p>We took our kid to see &#34;Alien&#34; (1979) on the big screen during its one-week-only theatrical run. We told him there was a good chance of a pre-show featurette that would spoil the movie, so he needed to be ready to cover his eyes.</p><p>Well, that&#39;s exactly what happened.</p><p>My kid threw his hoodie over his eyes while a pre-show interview between Fede Alvarez and Ridley Scott appeared, featuring tons of behind-the-scenes photos of the alien, the chestburster scene, and discussion of the legacy of the classic film.</p><p>Why do this before the movie!??!</p><p>If even one person in that theater hadn&#39;t seen the film yet, it puts a huge damper on the surprise and delight that the movie would bring them, which is sad. We WANT to bring first-timers to theaters to see classic movies. Don&#39;t ruin it for them.</p><p><b>Play that shit AFTER the movie.</b></p><p>This has happened with several re-releases for me. Fathom did this to &#34;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&#34; (pre-show highlighted a main character&#39;s death!) and &#34;Close Encounters&#34; (pre-show showed the effing aliens!). And now &#34;Alien&#34; (Disney/Fox).</p><p>The solution is simple: preserve the wonder for first-timers by putting these featurettes AFTER the movie. Tease it before the feature.</p><p>Anyway, <a href="https://www.fathomevents.com/events/close-encounters-of-the-third-kind-2024-re-release/">&#34;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&#34; is coming to theaters again this summer </a>(Fathom), so get ready to cover the eyes of first-timers before the show.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/tvaziri/status/1796955123337372032">Original tweet thread.</a></p>
