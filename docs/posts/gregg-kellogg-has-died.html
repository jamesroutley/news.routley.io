    <h1>Gregg Kellogg has died</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<pre id="start">Dear Members of the group,

We were informed yesterday of the passing last Saturday of Gregg Kellogg. It is terrible news but Gregg had been open about his health &lt;<a href="https://greggkellogg.net/health-faq.html">https://greggkellogg.net/health-faq.html</a>&gt;.

Gregg had been a prolific and appreciated W3C contributor for many years as a W3C Invited Expert, most recently as co-chair of the JSON-LD Working Group; he was also Chair of several data-related Community Groups. He was said to truly value the energy, brilliance, and camaraderie he found in his groups, and to feel rewarded for being part of such an inventive community.

Over the past 13 years [1], Gregg has been co-editor of 9 published recommendations, and a dozen other W3C specifications (CSV2RDF suite, a large portion of the RDF 1.2 suite, 1.0 and 1.1 versions of the JSON-LD suite, RCH, etc.) Remarkably, Gregg also provided open-source implementations of all these specifications (and more), as well a numerous test suites that the relevant Working Groups are still using. His implication in the JSON-LD Working Group was instrumental in the huge success of this W3C technology.

For all this, but also and foremost for his friendliness and good nature, he will be missed.

If any of you would like to pay tribute to honor Gregg Kellogg, please get in touch with the JSON-LD Working Group Staff Contact, Pierre-Antoine Champin &lt;<a href="mailto:pierre-antoine@w3.org?Subject=Re%3A%20Sad%20news%3A%20Gregg%20Kellogg%20passed%20away&amp;In-Reply-To=%3C21B2C159-0C89-4A80-85E1-3A2A19B5F677%40w3.org%3E&amp;References=%3C21B2C159-0C89-4A80-85E1-3A2A19B5F677%40w3.org%3E">pierre-antoine@w3.org</a>&gt;, as this group is currently making plans.

With kind regards,
Coralie Mercier, Director of W3C Marketing &amp; Communications
