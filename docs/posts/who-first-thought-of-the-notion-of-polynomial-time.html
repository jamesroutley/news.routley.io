    <h1>Who first thought of the notion of Polynomial Time?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-2374034479146058976" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>(Updated version of  <i>Computational Intractability: A Guide to Algorithmic Lower Bound</i> by Demaine-Gasarch-Hajiaghayi is <a href="https://hardness.mit.edu/">here</a>)</p><p>Any question like <i>who first though of X </i>is often hard to answer. I blogged about who first came up with the Fib numbers <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/search?q=Fib">here</a>. I&#39;ve heard rumors that IBM had search engines way before Google but could not figure out how to make money off of it. There are other examples. </p><p>I had learned that Cobham defined P in the paper <i>The intrinsic computational difficulty of functions</i>, in 1965. It was The conference on Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science. The paper is <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/cobham_intrinsic.pdf">here</a>.  Jack Edmonds had the notion of P in the paper <i>Paths, Trees, and Flowers <a href="https://math.nist.gov/~JBernal/p_t_f.pdf">here</a> </i>in 1965.</p><p>While it is true that Cobham defined P in that paper, and he might have been the first one to do so, was the notion somehow around earlier. I first thought the answer was no. Why?  Because if you look at Joe Kruskal&#39;s paper on MST  (see <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1956-007-01/S0002-9939-1956-0078686-7/S0002-9939-1956-0078686-7.pdf">here</a>) you don&#39;t see anything resembling time complexity. No O(E+Vlog V) or whatnot. So I thought that if the notion of  <i>this algorithm runs in such-and-such time </i>was not in the air, then certainly any notion of P could not have been. </p><p>Hence I was surprised when I accidentally (more on that later) came across the following: </p><p>In 1910 (really, 1910)  H.C.Pocklington analyzed two algorithms for solving quadratic congruences and noticed that </p><p><i>one took time proportional to a power of the log of the modulus, where as</i></p><p><i>the other took time proportional to the modulus itself or its square root. </i></p><p>THAT is the distinction between P and NOT-P. </p><p>The paper is titled <i>The determination of the exponent to which a number belongs, the practical solution of</i> <i>certain congruences, and the law of quadratic reciprocity. </i>It appeared in 1910, in the Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical  Society, Volume 16, pages 1-5. (I could not find it online. If you know of a place online for it, leave a comment.) </p><p>ADDED LATER: Here is the article in pieces: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pockpage1.png">Page 1</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pockpage2,3.png">Pages2,3</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pockpage4,5.png">Pages4,5</a>.</p><p>How did I come across this? And why had I NOT come across this in my roughly 40 years working in complexity theory? </p><p>I came across it while reading a blog of Scotts, <i>The Kolmogorov Option, </i>see <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3376">here</a> where Pocklington is mentioned in passing. I am surprised how arbitrary the set of things ones knows can be. I have put the Pocklington story in the Demaine-Gasarch-Hajiaghayi book <a href="https://hardness.mit.edu/">Computational Intractability: A Guide to Algorithmic Lower Bounds</a> so that this knowledge gets to be better known.</p><p>ADDED LATER: That Cobham and Edmonds are known for discovering or inventing P is an example of  the well known </p><p><b>Columbus Principle</b>: Things are named after the LAST person to discover them (note that Columbus was the last person to discover America.)</p><p>Bonus Question: Most principles where the author is not on it, the author might be unknown. NOT in this case. I KNOW who coined the term `Columbus Principle&#39; Do you? (It was not me.) </p>
