        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            I find these puzzles to be a fun mindless activity while listening to podcasts, thought I&#39;d
            share them. They&#39;re a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(puzzle)" target="_blank">
                Battleship Logic Puzzle</a> - also known as Battleship Solitaire, Bimaru, or Yubotu.
        </p>
        <p>
            Various sized ships (shown on top of the puzzle) are hidden on the board. 
            To solve the puzzle, fill all squares correctly.
            Numbers show how many &#34;boat squares&#34; are in each row or column:

            </p>

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Ships can&#39;t touch, not even diagonally. 
        </p>

        

        <h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
        <p>
            If you get stuck during a game, these rules / tips can help:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Only-spots-left rule:</strong> if a row has e.g. 3 boat squares and
            all but 3 squares are water, the rest must be boats:
        </p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://lukerissacher.com/static/images/battleships/only_spots_left.png?v=1518899129"/>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>The-rest-is-water rule:</strong> likewise, if a row already has the
            required number of boats (including 0), the rest is water:
        </p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://lukerissacher.com/static/images/battleships/rest_is_water.png?v=1518899297"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Tip: you can click on these numbers to auto-fill water.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Water-on-corners rule:</strong> since ships can&#39;t touch diagonally,
            you can always set the corners around a boat square to water:
        </p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://lukerissacher.com/static/images/battleships/fill_corners.png?v=1518899520"/>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Surround-whole-boats rule:</strong> if you know where a 
            whole boat is, you can surround it completely with water:
        </p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://lukerissacher.com/static/images/battleships/surround.png?v=1518899945"/>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Only-place-it-could-fit rule:</strong> often there&#39;s only one spot
            left on the board that the largest ship could fit:
        </p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://lukerissacher.com/static/images/battleships/only_fit.png?v=1518900280"/>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>Playable on mobile devices, for on-the-toilet fun.</p>
