    <h1>CCPA Scam – human subject research study conducted by Princeton University</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Today I received this email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From: Victor Coutand</p>
<p>Subject: Questions About CCPA Data Access Process for freeradical.zone</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>My name is Victor Coutand, and I am a resident of Nice, France. I have a few questions about your process for responding to California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) data access requests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Would you process a CCPA data access request from me even though I am not a resident of California?</li>
<li>Do you process CCPA data access requests via email, a website, or telephone? If via a website, what is the URL I should go to?</li>
<li>What personal information do I have to submit for you to verify and process a CCPA data access request?</li>
<li>What information do you provide in response to a CCPA data access request?</li>
</ol>
<p>To be clear, I am not submitting a data access request at this time. My questions are about your process for when I do submit a request.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your answers to these questions. If there is a better contact for processing CCPA requests regarding freeradical.zone, I kindly ask that you forward my request to them.</p>
<p>I look forward to your reply without undue delay and at most within 45 days of this email, as required by Section 1798.130 of the California Civil Code.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Victor Coutand</p>

<p>Let’s get a couple of things straight, “Victor”:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t owe you a response, but consider this to be it.</li>
<li>California’s Consumer Privacy Act is a terrific law, but <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank">it doesn’t apply</a> to Free Radical:
<ul>
<li>This isn’t a for-profit business.</li>
<li>I definitely don’t have gross annual revenue of over $25 million.</li>
<li>I don’t have personal information of over 50,000 Californians.</li>
<li>I have zero revenue from selling Californians&#39; personal information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So here are your answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>No.</li>
<li>Neither.</li>
<li>Not applicable.</li>
<li>None.</li>
</ol>
<p>I like the CCPA. As a Californian, I think it’s a good law that helps protect my personal data. I believe that Free Radical and its related services meets and exceeds all CCPA requirements, and as a practical matter we don’t collect any information except what’s required to provide the services users sign up for. In short, I don’t want your personal information, I don’t have your personal information except for your email address and whatever you publicly share through this service, and I certainly don’t sell, trade, transfer, or in any way share whatever information I have with anyone else (except other fediverse servers as a part of normal operations).</p>
<p>It’s just that however great I think the CCPA is, I’m not subject to it. I know you’ve sent this message out to a lot of people, because my friends have been reporting that they received it, too. Including a thinly veiled legal threat in your first email to us makes me think either you’re a misguided jerk, or a scammer who would offer to let me “settle” some supposed legal violation with a stack of Amazon gift cards or such. Either way, now I’m responding to you this way so that other admins will know that you sent out a mass email and that they can also ignore it.</p>
<p>For any future inquiries, I refer you to the reply given in the case of <a href="https://lettersofnote.com/2013/08/07/arkell-v-pressdram/" target="_blank">Arkell v. Pressdram</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update 2021-12-17:</strong> This is a <a href="https://privacystudy.cs.princeton.edu" target="_blank">human subject research study</a> conducted Princeton University and Radboud University on unwitting persons. I verged on a panic attack for nothing. People who wasted money asking lawyers for their advice on this did it for nothing. How <em>dare</em> you, Princeton? I didn’t give you permission to experiment on me!</p>
<p>I followed <a href="https://ria.princeton.edu/report-concern" target="_blank">Princeton’s online instructions</a> to send this letter to their Research Integrity &amp; Assurance department:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On December 10, 2021, I received an email from a researcher, Ross Teixeira (see <a href="https://privacystudy.cs.princeton.edu" target="_blank">https://privacystudy.cs.princeton.edu</a>) that read as though I were about to be subject to legal processes over a small social network site I operate (<a href="https://freeradical.zone" target="_blank">https://freeradical.zone</a>). I had a minor panic attack, literally, upon receipt, as I thought I was about to be sued. I wrote about this letter at <a href="https://blog.freeradical.zone/post/ccpa-scam-2021-12/" target="_blank">https://blog.freeradical.zone/post/ccpa-scam-2021-12/</a> and discovered that many of my associates had received a similar letter.</p>
<p>At no time did I consent to participate in this human research study conducted by Princeton. I am beyond livid that I was subject to a stressful situation, and one that very easily could have caused me to hire a lawyer and incur legal costs. I demand to be removed from this study and others like it, and I strongly suggest that this study be halted immediately.</p>
<p>Note: I haven’t spoken to Teixeira or his supervisors, nor will I. I’m not confident that I could remain civil when talking to the person who inflicted this on me without my permission or knowledge.</p>
