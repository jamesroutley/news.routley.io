<p>The Microsoft <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/foss-fund">FOSS Fund</a> has chosen GNOME as winner of 20th funding round for &#34;From low-level libs over the window manager to end user applications the GNOME project is an essential part of many graphical Linux devices.&#34; They also noted Ubuntu as &#34;the first Linux work environment supported at Microsoft&#34;, a pointer to help from Canonical for adapting Ubuntu WSL compatibility. For general folks it looks like yet another &#34;let&#39;s give a medal for our partners &#39;cause they&#39;re our partners&#34;, FOSS enthusiasts will blame them for &#34;EEE: Embrace, extend, and extinguish&#34; strategy and suggest to &#34;avoid evil Microsoft&#34;. Today Microsoft isn&#39;t so strong like before, despite this, it will be interesting to remember good old days and get the full picture. Many people just don&#39;t know about it, many just reject &#34;it was too long ago, now MS is different&#34;, and some people prefer to forget MS dark side &#39;cause they don&#39;t care. Put your seat belt on and take relaxing pills because we&#39;re about to take a trip down memory lane.</p>
<h3 id="open-letter-to-hobbyists-1976">Open Letter to Hobbyists, 1976</h3>
<p>Billy Gates wrote the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists">letter</a> about stealing software by hobbyists, said software written by Microsoft does not belongs to IBM hardware and people should pay money for usage. The world knowns nothing about &#34;Open Source&#34; and &#34;Free Software&#34; yet, people just share code for fun and profit.</p>
<h3 id="halloween-documents-1998">Halloween documents, 1998</h3>
<p>Leaked documents, yeah, exactly near October, 31, uncover a lot of dirty MS tactics against Linux and Open Source.</p>
<pre><code>Linux and other OSS advocates are making a progressively more credible argument that OSS software is at least as robust -- if not more -- than commercial alternatives. The Internet provides an ideal, high-visibility showcase for the OSS world.
</code></pre>
<p>MS was really scared and trying to attack Open Source as &#34;not stable enough for business&#34;, &#34;unpaid amateurs&#34;, &#34;real pros better than amateurs&#34;, &#34;management is so hard in OSS - buy our products&#34;. So they decided to spread FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) everywhere.</p>
<p>EEE was part of the document too: adopt open standards, extend with proprietary extensions, make it popular and finally replace original standard.</p>
<h3 id="sco-vs-ibm-novell-red-hat-2007-2016">SCO vs IBM, Novell, Red Hat, 2007-2016</h3>
<p>Epic, long legal battle for IBM source code rights, allegedly violated SCO licenses. SCO was backed by Microsoft several times, according to leaked <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2563673/update--microsoft-behind--50m-sco-investment.html">emails</a>. They <a href="https://www.information-age.com/microsoft-loses-106m-patent-infringement-case-1206328/">paid</a> SCO up to $106M and eventually lost it all. SCO&#39;s chances to win will bring huge benefits for Microsoft: patent fees from big Linux vendors to SCO and Microsoft, Linux kernel development activity hit, Linux brand trust and next similar cases. In short - they tried to scare people off to touch Linux as &#34;a project with legal issues&#34;.</p>
<h3 id="bill-gates-gpl-is-pac-mac-like-2001">Bill Gates: GPL is Pac-Mac-like, 2001</h3>
<p>&#34;GPL makes it impossible for a commercial company to use any of that work or build on any of that work. So what you saw with TCP/IP or Sendmail or the browser could never happen.&#34;, <a href="https://slashdot.org/story/01/06/20/1249203/bill-gates-says-gpl-is-like-pac-man">said</a> Microsoft&#39;s co-founder.</p>
<h3 id="linux-is-a-cancer-2001">Linux is a cancer, 2001</h3>
<p>&#34;Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches...The way the license is written (the Linux kernel uses the GPL), if you use any open-source software, you have to make the rest of your software open source.&#34;, said MS Chief Executive Stevie Balmer.</p>
<h3 id="linux-open-source-projects-violate-235-ms-patents">Linux &amp; Open Source Projects &#34;violate&#34; 235 MS patents</h3>
<p>&#34;We live in a world where we honor, and support the honoring of, intellectual property&#34;, said Balmer, and told Open Source must &#34;play by the same rules as the rest of the business.&#34;</p>
<h3 id="android-patents-since-2011">Android patents, since 2011</h3>
<p>Android attack feel similar to SCO adventure with the big difference: here Microsoft decided to avoid tech giants (who can hit them back) and attack middle and small hardware vendors.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/microsoft-android-patent-licensing-and-litigation-graph.png" alt="Microsoft patent attacks, source: howtogeek.com" loading="lazy"/></p>
<p>All deals were negotiated under closed doors and details never publicly released, so Microsoft is making easy money ($5-$15) for almost every Android phone. They announced in 2012 the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-01-12-microsoft-lg-patent-license.html">stats</a> saying nearly 70% of Android devices covered by their patents.</p>
<h3 id="proprietary-extensions-for-ms-open-source-projects">Proprietary extensions for MS Open Source projects</h3>
<p>Since Nadella headed Microsoft, they are changing a lot in many aspects. I still refuse to believe MS changed course by 180 degrees, but many people, actually, do. Despite pathetic slogans like &#34;MS love Linux&#34;, &#34;MS love Open Source&#34; they&#39;re, sometimes, still acting in a proprietary way. MS OSS projects, of course, deserve all the glory and fame; glad they&#39;re doing them; let&#39;s not forget the good stuff.</p>
<h4 id="net">.NET</h4>
<p>Microsoft <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22217">deleted</a> the open source <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-hot-reload/">Hot Reload</a> feature, &#39;cause they decided to shit it only in commercial edition of Visual Studio 2022. After scandal and <a href="https://twitter.com/pkese/status/1451559464046370817">closed discussion</a>, MS decided to return it.</p>
<h4 id="visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</h4>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance">PyLance</a>, a proprietary extension for Visual Studio Code, probably the most popular MS open source project last year, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/k0s8qw/vs_code_developers_prevent_running_the_new/">refuses</a> to run on non-VSC builds. Microsoft still loves open source, don&#39;t ya?</p>
<h3 id="microsoft-plutonhardware-drm-inside-amd-cpu-2022">Microsoft Pluton - hardware DRM inside AMD CPU, 2022</h3>
<p>Pluton, a security processor core plus hardware crypto interface, now built-in into AMD 6000 CPU series and get his proprietary updates from Windows update. So, this is the absolutely new level - MS got a secure core with access to MS key store, all &#34;hidden deeply inside&#34;.</p>
<h3 id="finish-line">Finish line</h3>
<p>Microsoft has a long story with Open Source; they tried to destroy it, when FOSS became widely popular, they embraced it and started to make open projects too, but also released proprietary extensions and &#34;special&#34; proprietary features. <strong>&#34;Microsoft ❤️ Open Source&#34; ends where their benefits end.</strong></p>
