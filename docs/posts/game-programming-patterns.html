<h2>Hey, Game Developer!</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do you struggle to make your code hang together into a cohesive whole?</li>
  <li>Find it harder to make changes as your codebase grows?</li>
  <li>Feel like your game is a giant hairball where everything is intertwined with everything else?</li>
  <li>Wonder if and how design patterns apply to games?</li>
  <li>Hear things like “cache coherency” and “object pools”, but don’t know how to use them to make your game faster?</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p><em>I’m here to help!</em> <strong>Game Programming Patterns</strong> is a collection of patterns I found in games that <strong>make code cleaner, easier to understand, and faster</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the book I wish I had when I started making games, and now I want you to have it. It’s available in four formats:</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h4>Do the different versions have different content?</h4>

<p>Nope! Each format has every chapter in full, every illustration, and all of the asides you know and love. Even the free web version.</p>

<h4>Which version pays you the most?</h4>

<p>First of all, thank you for caring about this! Since I self-published, I set the prices so that the royalties are about the same for each format. (I also get the lion’s share of the money since there’s no publisher taking a cut.)</p>

<p>Buy the format you want and I’ll get paid pretty much the same either way. If you want to give me money, but don’t actually want a physical book, consider giving it to a friend or your local library. I get money, you feel good, and someone gets a free book!</p>

<h4>If I buy the print edition, can I get the eBook cheaper?</h4>

<p>Yes, mostly. I have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/digital/ep-landing-page?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0">MatchBook</a> enabled on the <em>Kindle</em> edition. If you buy the print copy, you can get the Kindle version for just $3.00. I don’t have a way to set up anything similar for the other eBook formats, unfortunately.</p>

<h4>I am a poor student. How can I get your book cheaply?</h4>

<p>I had you in mind when I decided to put the <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html">entire contents of the book</a> on the web for free. I put more than five years of my life into this book, and I want as many people to have access to it as possible. The web version is also a great starting point to see if you like the book before you plunk down cash.</p>

<h4>Do the digital editions use DRM?</h4>

<p>Heck no! If you have been kind enough to pay for the book, I want to give you the most flexibility I can. You should be able to freely transfer it to all of your devices, archive it, etc.</p>

<h4>I’m in Canada. How can I get the print edition?</h4>

<p>CreateSpace does not directly ship to Canada which is why you don’t see it on amazon.ca. Instead, a kind reader tells me that <a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/Game-Programming-Patterns-Robert-Nystrom/9780990582908">you can get it from Book Depository</a>. If that doesn’t work, you may be able to buy it from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0990582906" target="_blank">amazon.com</a> or <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/game-programming-patterns-robert-nystrom/1102794265?ean=9780990582908" target="_blank">barnesandnoble.com</a> and get it shipped from the US.</p>

<h2>Who Am I?</h2><p><img src="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/images/dogshot.jpg"/></p><div>
<p>I’m Bob Nystrom. I started writing this book while working at Electronic Arts. In my eight years there, I saw a lot of beautiful code, and a lot of not-so-beautiful code. My hope was that I could take what I learned from the good stuff, write it down here, and then teach it to the people writing the awful stuff.</p>

<p>If you want to get in touch with me, you can email <code>bob</code> at this site or just ask me (<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=munificentbob"><code>@munificentbob</code></a>) on twitter. If you just can’t get enough of my writing, I also have <a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/">a blog</a>. If you like the book, you’ll probably like it too.</p>

<h2>Keep in Touch</h2>

<p>Part of the magic of writing a book online is that it’s easy to change. If you find mistakes or have suggestions, please don’t hesitate to <a href="https://github.com/munificent/game-programming-patterns/issues">file a bug</a> or send me a pull request.</p>

<p>I’d love to be able to contact <em>you</em> too. If you put your email address in the little box, I’ll let you know about updates to the book. I post less than once a month, so don’t worry about me spamming you.</p>
