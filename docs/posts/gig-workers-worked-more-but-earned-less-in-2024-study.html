Their hours worked fell 4.9%.</p><p>&#34;Drivers are earning less across all of the platforms,&#34; Ryan Green, the CEO of Gridwise, told Business Insider.</p><p>Meantime at DoorDash, gross weekly earnings rose 4.8% to $240 in 2024. Hourly earnings for those on the app fell, though, as the number of hours that gig workers spent on the app rose 5.2%.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>Amazon Flex workers were in a similar situation. Their earnings soared 18.1% to $413 a week — just as their hours increased 20.4%.</p><p>Uber Eats workers made $178 a week, or 5.1% more than 2023. Average worker hours on the app rose 2.1%, though.</p><p>The only app where workers earned significantly more money for the same or less work was Favor, a service owned by Texas supermarket H-E-B that delivers online orders for the chain. There, workers saw their pay rise 3.4% to $155 a week in 2024 as their hours worked fell 13.1%.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>In response to the report, an Uber spokesperson told BI that its drivers make more than $30 an hour on average.</p><p>A Lyft spokesperson referred BI to comments that CEO David Risher made this month on the company&#39;s earnings call, including that ride-hailing drivers on the app earned a collective $9 billion in 2024. That was &#34;the highest amount of combine driver earnings on our platform ever,&#34; Risher said.</p><p>&#34;Several of the claims made in the Gridwise report related to driver earnings and market share are likely based on different methodologies, painting an incomplete picture,&#34; a spokesperson from Lyft told BI.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>An Instacart spokesperson called the report&#39;s findings &#34;inaccurate and misleading.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Shopper earnings remain steady across the Instacart platform, and we continue to hear from shoppers that Instacart creates rewarding, flexible earnings opportunities that allow them to earn on their own time and their own terms,&#34; the spokesperson said.</p><p>DoorDash declined to comment. Amazon and Favor did not respond to requests for comment.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p><strong><em>We want to hear from you. Are you a gig worker?

The company analyzed 171 million trips and $1.9 billion worth of gig worker earnings documented by the app to compile its findings for 2024.</p><p>The report also found that the average restaurant delivery worker relied on tips for a majority — 53.4% — of their earnings. For grocery delivery workers, 45.7% of earnings came from tips.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>Tips were much less significant for ride-hailing drivers, Gridwise found. Gratuities made up just 10.4% of earnings, per the report.</p><p>Gig workers have told BI that claiming good-paying rides and orders on the apps has gotten more competitive. Some workers have even set up their own businesses to offer rides or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-started-own-delivery-business-after-working-for-uber-eats-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">deliver restaurant food</a> in hopes of making more money than they do on the apps.</p><p>Consumers, meanwhile, told Gridwise that they plan to keep using ride-hailing and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-diners-splurge-food-delivery-doordash-grubhub-ubereats-convenience-rules-2024-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">delivery services</a> despite the lingering effects of inflation on many items in Americans&#39; monthly budgets.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>Majorities of the 1,000 customers surveyed by Gridwise in January said that they thought prices on both ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft as well as grocery delivery apps like Instacart were &#34;reasonable.&#34;</p><p>&#34;They talk about being price-sensitive, but their actions reflect differently,&#34; Green said.</p><p><em>Do you work for Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, or another service that uses gig workers and have a story idea to share?
