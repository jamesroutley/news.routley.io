<p>Inform is a programming language for creating interactive fiction, using natural
language syntax. Using natural language and drawing on ideas from linguistics
and from literate programming, Inform is widely used as a medium for literary
writing, as a prototyping tool in the games industry, and in education, both at
school and university level (where Inform is often assigned material for courses
on digital narrative). It has several times ranked in the top 100 most
influential programming languages according to the TIOBE index. Created in April
2006, it was open-sourced in April 2022.</p>
