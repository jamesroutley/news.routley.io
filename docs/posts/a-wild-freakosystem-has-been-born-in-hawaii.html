Broadly, novel ecosystems can be defined as &#34;autonomous, wild ecosystems that deviate from natural baselines because of human activities&#34;, explains ecologist Jens-Christian Svenning, a professor at Aarhus University in Denmark who studies these ecosystems. Novel ecosystems may contain combinations of species never before seen in history: with some native species living alongside other species introduced by humans beyond their historically recorded ranges or driven into new locations by climate change.<!-- --></p><p>Humans may also alter the environment itself, creating new habitats by <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x">reshaping the landscape<!-- --></a> or altering environmental chemistry. For example, along the coast of the Netherlands, marine ecologist Laura Govers has <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rug.nl/fse/news/climate-and-nature/20250325-swimwaywaddenmozaiek?lang=en">documented how<!-- --></a> a system of coastal defences like dams and sea walls, built during the mid-20th Century, has created a series of salty lakes where exotic species have flourished.<!-- --></p><div data-component="quote-block"><div><p><span>For the last decade scientists have studied O&#39;ahu as an &#39;amazing crystal ball&#39; that offers a glimpse of the future of our planet – Jef Vizentin-Bugoni</span></p></div></div><p>One former shale oil mine between the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow left a mountain made of stone, says Eric Higgs, professor of ecology at the University of Victoria in Canada. Over at least a century piles of stone formed a novel ecosystem through natural assembly processes, says Higgs. It is now a specially protected area that <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277043838_West_Lothian_Biodiversity_Action_Plan_Oil_Shale_Bings">harbours rare plants<!-- --></a> such as the early purple orchid and the tiny white flowers of the knotted pearlwort.<!-- --></p><p>Unlike zoos and botanical gardens, which also contain globe-spanning collages of plants and animals, novel ecosystems like those on O&#39;ahu are not dependent on humans to continually plant and maintain them. They now exist as self-sustaining systems, says Svenning. &#34;These are wild but <!-- --><i id="changed">changed<!-- --></i> ecosystems,&#34; he says. They have passed some critical threshold which means they are unlikely to ever go back to how they were before. &#34;If you removed all people from the planet, Hawaii would be on a different evolutionary ecological trajectory going forward,&#34; he says.<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l27pnq.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l27pnq.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l27pnq.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l27pnq.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l27pnq.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l27pnq.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l27pnq.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l27pnq.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l27pnq.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l27pnq.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Jef Vizentin-Bugoni Researchers studying O&#39;ahu&#39;s unusual ecosystem during fieldwork on a site in Kahanahaiki (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)"/><span>Jef Vizentin-Bugoni</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Researchers studying O&#39;ahu&#39;s unusual ecosystem during fieldwork on a site in Kahanahaiki (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>However, these figures – like much around &#34;novel ecosystems&#34; – remain highly controversial among ecologists. <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534714001578">Critics argue that<!-- --></a> scientists often cannot clearly define when a threshold of novelty has been passed.

Like Marris, many urban communities have come to love novel environments that have arisen in their local neighbourhoods.

Matthew Kerr, a researcher in Svenning&#39;s lab at Aarhus University who made the map, says he found that novel habitats are now truly global, with more than half of the earth&#39;s land highly changed: &#34;This extended out to protected areas,&#34; he says, including nature parks and marine reserves.<!-- --></p><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2><span id="discovering-what-works"><b id="discovering-what-works">Discovering what works<!-- --></b></span></h2></p><p>O&#39;ahu, at least, is teaching us important lessons that can help protect other environments not yet so degraded, including other islands where native ecosystems remain healthier, says Vizentin-Bugoni.
