(Really.)</p><p>You’ll build a compiler that compiles a simple programming language down to WebAssembly.</p><p>The focus is on WebAssembly, <em>not</em> the finer details of parsing. The compiler is built in JavaScript, using <a href="https://ohmjs.org">Ohm</a>, a user-friendly parsing toolkit.</p><p>No compiler expertise is necessary; all the code you need is provided in the book. Everything proceeds step by step — in small, logical increments.</p></div></section>
<section><div><h2 id="whats-inside">What’s Inside?</h2><p>Here’s a peek inside the book — 15 chapters of technical content, and two bonus chapters.</p><p>Full source code (including tests) is available for each milestone in every chapter. The code is MIT-licensed, so you’re free to use it in your own projects.</p><p><img src="https://wasmgroundup.com/assets/images/code-preview-lg-3f0cd4ea851997e0a8dded99174e6ad7.webp"/><img src="https://wasmgroundup.com/assets/images/code-preview-sm-2f615841a13920f40ce20a089cbd5950.webp"/></p></div></section>

<section><div><h2 id="youll-learn">You’ll learn…</h2><ul>
<li>What exactly WebAssembly <em>is</em>, and what makes it unique.</li>
<li>How to instantiate a WebAssembly module in JavaScript and run its functions.</li>
<li>The binary module format, and how to hand craft a module from scratch.</li>
<li>How to create a simple compiler with <a href="https://ohmjs.org">Ohm</a>.</li>
<li>The instruction set: numeric instructions, memory access, control flow, etc.</li>
<li>How to interact with the outside world.</li>
<li>The WebAssembly security model: what makes it safe?</li>
</ul></div></section>
<section><div><h2 id="who-should-read-this-book">Who should read this book?</h2><p>The book is mainly targeted at experienced programmers. You don’t need to be an expert, but ideally you’ve been programming for a few years and are fluent in more than one language. For important topics that some readers might not be familiar with, we’ve included optional <em>deep dive</em> sections to get you up to speed.</p><p>In order to understand the code, you’ll need at least intermediate knowledge of JavaScript, or a willingness to learn. We try to stick to “the good parts” and to avoid any advanced or obscure features.</p><p>You do not need any previous experience with writing a compiler! Our compiler
is based on Ohm, a framework that handles the lower-level details of parsing. This lets us keep the focus on WebAssembly.</p><p>For some reason, many people believe that writing a compiler is a complex, esoteric task. But we hope to convince you that it’s really not.</p></div></section>
