    <h1>The long life of Apache httpd 2.4</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The long life of Apache httpd 2.4</h2>

	<p><small>May 19, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>Here&#39;s something that hadn&#39;t struck me until I looked it up for
this entry: <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> 2.4 is now more
than ten years old. The first 2.4 release was made in early 2012
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">per Wikipedia</a>),
and despite being that old, 2.4 remains the current version of the
Apache web server (with 2.4.57 released in early April of this year,
2023). There is a &#39;2.5&#39; in development which will be released as
2.6, someday, but <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/new_features_2_6.html">the current trunk 2.5/2.6 changes are somewhat
underwhelming</a>.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t entirely new in the Apache (httpd) project, since the
initial releases of 2.2 and 2.4 were almost seven years apart, but
it still feels like we&#39;ve been using Apache 2.4 forever and are
going to keep on using it for the foreseeable future. This isn&#39;t
particularly a bad thing; for example, I&#39;ve certainly got a lot of
use over the years out of Apache 2.4 expertise. But it does feel a
little bit peculiar that such a core part of the web has stayed so
stable for so long (I know that Apache is no longer the trendy web
server, but <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/ApacheLove">we love it</a> and I think it&#39;s still
reasonably commonly used).</p>

<p>That Apache 2.4 is having a long life hasn&#39;t prevented the Apache
project from advancing 2.4&#39;s capabilities over time, certainly in
Apache modules and I believe in the core as well. One example of
an addition to 2.4 is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket</a>
support, which Wikipedia says was added in 2.4.5 (and actually
released in 2.4.6). Another case is HTTP/2, with <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_http2.html">mod_http2</a> added in
2.4.17. If Apache can keep evolving this way to support future web
changes like HTTP/3 (assuming there&#39;s enough demand for them in
Apache in the first place), it may be a long time before we see an
Apache 2.6.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is a bad thing, but it does seem like an unusual
one. In a world where software versions churn on a regular basis,
Apache 2.4 stands out as an unusually long-lived thing.</p>

<p>(Of course, version numbers and their meanings are somewhat arbitrary.
Apache 2.4.0 from 2012 is not really the same piece of software as
Apache 2.4.57 from 2023. Consider <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/ApachePreforkHopefullyNoMore">the changes in Multi-Processing
Modules (MPM)s over 2.4&#39;s lifetime so far</a>.)</p>
