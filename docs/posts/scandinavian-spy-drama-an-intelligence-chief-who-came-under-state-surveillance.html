    <h1>Scandinavian spy drama: An intelligence chief who came under state surveillance</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>Lars Findsen was in police custody when he discovered that spies from Denmark’s domestic intelligence agency had tapped his phone and wired his house with bugs.</p><p>The spies, he learned, had spent months eavesdropping on his daily life at home, recording hundreds of hours of his conversations in his home, including with his three children.</p><p>It was the kind of intrusive surveillance operation normally reserved for a suspected terrorist or enemy foreign agent. Findsen was neither; he was Denmark’s top spy chief.</p><p>Findsen had spent decades working at the highest levels of the secret services. He was appointed head of the country’s foreign intelligence service in 2015. Previously, he had run its sister domestic agency which, he now understood, had been monitoring his every move.</p><p>In custody, Findsen was presented with reports from the operation. “That was the shocking thing,” he told the Guardian, “to sit and look at your life transformed into police reports written from surveillance tapes.”</p><figure id="6e02b826-a39c-4a32-bf43-0d16084fd407" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11398df5c5a36028afbae393d93fe2c72cde3a48/478_148_3497_2098/master/3497.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11398df5c5a36028afbae393d93fe2c72cde3a48/478_148_3497_2098/master/3497.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11398df5c5a36028afbae393d93fe2c72cde3a48/478_148_3497_2098/master/3497.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11398df5c5a36028afbae393d93fe2c72cde3a48/478_148_3497_2098/master/3497.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11398df5c5a36028afbae393d93fe2c72cde3a48/478_148_3497_2098/master/3497.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11398df5c5a36028afbae393d93fe2c72cde3a48/478_148_3497_2098/master/3497.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Lars Findsen in 2019" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11398df5c5a36028afbae393d93fe2c72cde3a48/478_148_3497_2098/master/3497.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="266.9745496139548" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Lars Findsen was appointed head of the country’s foreign intelligence service in 2015.</span> Photograph: Ritzau/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>This autumn, the 59-year-old spymaster is due to stand trial on charges that he disclosed state secrets to journalists and close relatives including his 84-year old mother, in a series of conversations that appear to have been recorded by the tiny listening devices that were hidden in his home.</p><p>The prosecution of such a senior intelligence official may seem extraordinary, but shortly after the proceedings get under way, a separate trial will open in which Findsen’s former boss at Denmark’s defence ministry will face similar charges.</p><p>The veteran government minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen is a towering figure in Danish politics who has held multiple senior cabinet positions. As defence minister until 2019, he oversaw the intelligence service run by Findsen.</p><p>The criminal cases have rocked Denmark, a scandal that’s turned spy against spy and thrust into the spotlight one of the country’s most closely guarded secrets – which both men now stand accused of betraying.</p><p>At stake, however, is more than the fate of two individuals. The drama has had a profoundly chilling effect on the Danish media and given rise to a slow-burning political crisis about the lengths to which an otherwise liberal European democracy is prepared to go to control its secrets.</p><p>Alarmed by the government’s handling of the affair and the criminal proceedings it is now pursuing, one of the country’s top legal professors recently asked: “What’s going on? Hello, we are in Denmark, a state governed by the rule of law.

Under the draconian law, those found guilty can be imprisoned for up to 12 years.</p><p>Both men believe they’re innocent. Findsen has described the charges against him as “completely insane”, while Frederiksen believes his case is politically motivated, likening it to a bewildering “hoax”. “To understand what’s going on with me at the moment,” he says, “think of Kafka”.</p><p>Just one of the bizarre aspects of both cases is that the unmentionable state secrets the men are alleged to have leaked are now open secrets and widely known to relate to a long-standing intelligence partnership between Denmark and the US.</p><p>The secret deal – the “crown jewels” of Danish intelligence – was hidden from the public until details began to emerge in 2014, when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files" data-link-name="in body link">documents leaked by Edward Snowden</a> revealed how European countries such as Denmark help facilitate the US’s globe-spanning electronic surveillance.</p><p>The disclosures have cast a long shadow over the scandal that’s ensnared Findsen and Frederiksen. The scale of western intelligence agencies’ bulk surveillance programmes may have faded from most memories. In Denmark, repercussions of Snowden’s leaks are still playing out today.</p><h2 id="spy-turns-whistleblower">Spy turns whistleblower</h2><p>On the windswept southern tip of Amager, the island immediately south of Copenhagen, there is a cluster of drab grey buildings surrounded by a high barbed-wire fence and watchful surveillance cameras. Known as “the Farm”, the site is home to Denmark’s foreign intelligence service, and it’s where one of its young officers set the story in motion.</p><p>In June 2014, the Danish newspaper Dagbladet Information published a piece based on Snowden’s leaks revealing a secret agreement between the intelligence service, known as DDIS, and the US National Security Agency to tap fibre-optic cables transporting internet traffic through Denmark.</p><figure id="75f9f844-9f15-4b8a-9eec-dff4f8bca375" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.GuideAtomBlockElement"><gu-island name="GuideAtomWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;083952b7-d8bd-419d-bb44-ccd43ef6ebc7&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;US and Denmark&#39;s secret cable-tapping deal&#34;,&#34;html&#34;:&#34;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US and Denmark&#39;s secret cable-tapping deal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, the US and Denmark struck a deal to secretly intercept telecoms and internet traffic passing through Danish fibre-optic cables after spies at the US National Security Agency (NSA) discovered the Scandinavian country was a critical hub for global communications traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highly classified deal, Danish newspaper Berlingske reported, was kept secret for more than two decades by a succession of government ministers, officials and spy chiefs.

When its findings were shared with senior managers, his concerns were dismissed as unfounded and he was ordered to cease the investigation.</p><p>Rather than drop it, the spy took the extraordinary step of beginning to secretly record conversations with colleagues. Conversations about the NSA partnership with Denmark’s most senior spymasters, including Lars Findsen, appear to have been among those captured over a period of several years.</p><p>Today, Findsen is sharply critical of the officer and says there was “no basis” for his actions.

Behind closed doors, the spy had turned whistleblower.</p><h2 id="a-historic-scandal">A ‘historic scandal’?</h2><p>In August 2020, “all hell broke loose”, a former intelligence official recalls. The independent watchdog, led by a senior judge, revealed in a brief statement that it had obtained a large amount of material from a whistleblower and listed a series of incendiary allegations about how the DDIS spy service was operating.</p><p>Among its findings, the body warned there were “risks in the central part of DDIS’s intelligence gathering capabilities that unauthorised intelligence has been gathered on Danish citizens”. The statement was not explicit, but according to former officials this was a reference to data collected under the NSA cable-tapping programme.</p><p>The fallout was immediate. Findsen and several colleagues at the agency were placed on indefinite leave. “It was not a nice situation,” says Findsen.</p><p>The media branded the findings a “historic scandal” and suggested the spies were working outside the law, effectively acting as a “state within a state”. As one front page read: “Spy chiefs accused of illegal surveillance”.</p><figure id="ce1bfe0c-aef7-4b28-8d6e-cccea953dfd5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Lars Findsen in Copenhagen in December 2017" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="266.9261615044248" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Lars Findsen in Copenhagen in December 2017.</span> Photograph: Liselotte Sabroe/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Responding to the coverage, Frederiksen, who had left the defence ministry a year earlier, defended Findsen and the other officials. “This is what triggered my involvement in this case,” Frederiksen says. “I knew them as loyal employees, dedicated and honest people, who were unjustly labelled as having done something wrong.”</p><p>In September 2020, Frederiksen publicly criticised the decision to publish the watchdog’s findings and, crucially, while defending the DDIS employees he appeared to provide the first on-the-record confirmation of the existence of the cable-tapping deal with the US glimpsed in the Snowden leaks.</p><p>Frederiksen acknowledged the arrangement again in subsequent interviews and went further in another media appearance in December 2021. “I’m going to be careful what I can say, otherwise I’ll risk a prison sentence,” he said on live TV before remarking that Denmark “greatly benefits from being allied with the NSA”.</p><p>Shortly before the interview, a government-appointed panel of judges had rejected the independent watchdog’s findings, seemingly drawing a line under the controversy.</p><p>Behind the scenes, there had been a remarkable twist. People close to Findsen were suddenly unable to contact him. It was as though he’d disappeared.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-42">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-42" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>What only a few in Denmark knew was that, days earlier, a group of armed officers had stopped the spy chief at Copenhagen airport and, before anyone could notice, quietly arrested him.</p><h2 id="microphones-were-everywhere">‘Microphones were everywhere’</h2><p>Speaking to the Guardian as he prepares for trial, Findsen appears relaxed, though there is undoubtedly a quiet anger as he describes the events of the past three years.</p><p>Released from prison in February 2022 after 70 days in custody, Findsen technically remains head of the spy agency DDIS, albeit suspended and on two-thirds salary. He says he cannot be certain he’s not still under surveillance.</p><p>Suddenly finding himself in prison, he says, was strange. “There were no other spy chiefs,” he jokes. He says he established good relations with the other prisoners. “They were much younger than me. They were there for things like drugs, arms dealing and kidnapping, so it was a different environment for me.”</p><p>Findsen’s close ties to the domestic service, which he previously ran after 9/11, added to the sense of betrayal when he came to understand colleagues had authorised a surveillance operation against him, which he believes lasted for more than a year.</p><p>“The microphones were everywhere,” he says, not just in his kitchen and living rooms, but in his car and holiday home.</p><p>In custody, he was shown the surveillance reports being used as evidence against him. His daily family life was described in the kind of documents he’d spent a career in intelligence reading. “I was talking to my children when they came back from school and things like that.”</p><p>Perhaps unusually for a spy chief, Findsen had developed relationships with journalists, on which he’s believed to have relied to counter negative stories about DDIS once sent home in 2020 after the watchdog’s damning statement.</p><p>Prosecutors allege that Findsen shared state secrets with two reporters, as well as close relatives, his girlfriend and an old friend. Much about the case remains shrouded in secrecy but Danish journalists reported last year that prosecutors allege Findsen’s conversations related to the NSA cable-tapping partnership.</p><p>In April 2021, for example, he is alleged to have spoken to his 84-year-old mother about the whistleblower who raised the alarm about the deal. Many of the conversations, it is alleged, risked causing “significant damage” to Denmark’s “security and relations with foreign powers”. Unable to discuss the specific charges, Findsen describes them as “crazy and ridiculous”.</p><p>As for the whistleblower, he remains an elusive protagonist at the heart of the affair. Now in his 40s, he’s never spoken publicly. He no longer works at DDIS and appears to be living a quiet life in the countryside running a small cybersecurity business. He did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment.</p><h2 id="state-secrets-in-the-public-domain">State secrets in the public domain</h2><p>In December 2021, a week after the Frederiksen, the former minister, mentioned the NSA cable-tapping deal on television, police officers turned up at his home. Standing outside the thatched fisherman’s cottage, the officers informed the 76-year-old he’d been charged with treason.</p><p>The charges have been brought under a section of the criminal code last used against an East German Stasi agent in 1979. It is the same law that is being used in Findsen’s case but Frederiksen is accused of disclosing classified information in media appearances rather than in private. He denies revealing state secrets in the interviews, since the information he shared – which he can no longer repeat – had been in the public domain since the 2014 Snowden story.</p><figure id="319c339e-cf18-478a-bbc5-13bb66ad1c09" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-6"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Edward Snowden" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed how European countries such as Denmark help facilitate the US’s globe-spanning electronic surveillance.</span> Illustration: Joseph Pierce/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>“The present government is of the opinion that a secret is a secret,” Frederiksen says. “It might have been described in the newspapers, but they still say it’s a secret.” In court, the trial is expected to turn on whether an open secret can still be a state secret.</p><p>The paradox in both cases is that Findsen and Frederiksen, according to people who know them, are staunch believers in DDIS’s US partnership and proud of its special relationship with the NSA.
