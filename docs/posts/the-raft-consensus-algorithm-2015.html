    <h1>The Raft Consensus Algorithm (2015)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<h2>What is Raft?</h2>

<p>
Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It&#39;s
equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that
it&#39;s decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly
addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. We hope Raft will make
consensus available to a wider audience, and that this wider audience will be
able to develop a variety of higher quality consensus-based systems than are
available today.

<h2>Hold onâ€”what is consensus?</h2>

<p>
Consensus is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed systems.
Consensus involves multiple servers agreeing on values. Once they reach a
decision on a value, that decision is final. Typical consensus algorithms make
progress when any majority of their servers is available; for example, a
cluster of 5 servers can continue to operate even if 2 servers fail.
If more servers fail, they stop making progress (but will never return an
incorrect result).
</p>

<p>
Consensus typically arises in the context of replicated state machines, a
general approach to building fault-tolerant systems. Each server has a state
machine and a log. The state machine is the component that we want to make
fault-tolerant, such as a hash table. It will appear to clients that they are
interacting with a single, reliable state machine, even if a minority of the
servers in the cluster fail. Each state machine takes as input commands from
its log. In our hash table example, the log would include commands like <em>set
x to 3</em>. A consensus algorithm is used to agree on the commands in the
servers&#39; logs. The consensus algorithm must ensure that if any state machine
applies <em>set x to 3</em> as the <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> command, no other
state machine will ever apply a different <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> command. As a
result, each state machine processes the same series of commands and thus
produces the same series of results and arrives at the same series of states.
