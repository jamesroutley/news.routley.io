		<p>While perusing Xcode’s AppleScript scripting dictionary, I was surprised to discover a rather robust “example code” section included right there among the usually spartan reference of the app’s scriptable entities:</p>
<p><img src="https://indiestack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XcodeBuildCommand.png" alt="Screenshot of Xcode&#39;s scripting dictionary, including a section with example script code for the &#39;build&#39; command" title="XcodeBuildCommand.png" width="500"/></p>
<p>Curious to learn more, I used a relatively little-known trick for examining the raw source code of a scripting dictionary. Simply click and drag from Script Editor’s document proxy icon, into a text editor such as TextEdit, Xcode, or <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html">BBEdit</a>:</p>

<p>This trick is especially handy because even if the app in question <em>doesn’t have</em> a standard scripting definition (.sdef) file representing its interface, Script Editor will generate one dynamically for you. It’s a quick-and-dirty way to learn how specific outcomes are achieved, and how you might incorporate similar features in your own app’s scripting definition file. In this case, I discovered a new (to me) “documentation” element in the file:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://indiestack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/DocumentationElementXcode.png" alt="Screenshot of source code reflecting the example script inline documentation pictured above" title="DocumentationElementXcode.png" width="500" height="133"/></p>
<p>I was not aware of the feature until a few weeks ago, but apparently it’s been there since at least Mac OS 10.5. <a href="https://latenightsw.com">Script Debugger</a> supports it, too! You can read more about the “documentation” element by invoking “man 5 sdef” from the Terminal:</p>
<blockquote><p>When an element needs more exposition than a simple ‘description’ attribute can provide, use a documentation element.  A documentation element may contain any number of html elements, which contain text that will be displayed at that point in the dictionary.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the sad state of support for AppleScript by Apple, and the continued low level of adoption by 3rd-party developers, a feature like this will probably never be widely used or celebrated. But at least in <a href="https://redsweater.com//fastscripts/">FastScripts</a> 3.2.4, which I just released this morning, I’m now taking advantage of it:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://indiestack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SearchTextDictionary.png" alt="Screenshot showing FastScripts &#39;search text&#39; command with an inline documentation block" title="SearchTextDictionary.png" width="500" height="179"/></p>
<p>If you’re among the few remaining Mac developers who is investing time and effort into your AppleScript scripting definitions, hopefully you’ll find this feature useful!</p>
