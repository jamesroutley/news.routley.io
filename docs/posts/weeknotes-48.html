<li>hello! hi! hey!</li>
<li>started using khan academy to explain the bits of maths i don&#39;t understand or remember well (today logarithms, tomorrow who knows) whilst i work through grokking algorithms (a book, seems short and sweet) and then attempt the algorithm design manual lecture and book again. it&#39;s less short, less sweet, lol, but more information! delicious information! i&#39;ll let you know how it goes. people in <a href="https://recurse.com">recurse</a> also kindly offered to explain stuff but i&#39;ll keep that in my back pocket for when i&#39;m genuinely stumped. which will probably be soon ngl!</li>
<li>this week i&#39;ve done so much laundry. i was so behind and now i&#39;m caught up save for things that can&#39;t really go in the washing machine without taking your life and your deposit in your hands. hopefully laundry mountain stays conquered for longer than usual.</li>
<li>much less reading than <a href="https://olu.online/weeknotes-47">last week</a>; i read a bit more of <em>more than a glitch</em>, and started grokking algorithms, that&#39;s about it. will do better next week!</li>
<li>decluttering a lot too, and simultaneously trying to finish off some sewing projects. lots of moving parts and thus stuff everywhere, but for once i&#39;m super confident that it will get better. only way out is through, after all!</li>
<li>looking for a book about drawing as i was reminded that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEVbY8PNNmL/">i made a bingo card for this year</a> and that was on it. <a href="https://olu.online/contact">let me know</a> if you have any faves? especially if you learnt to draw as an adult! i tried to do <a href="https://drawabox.com/">draw a box</a> years ago but didn&#39;t stay the course and found it very dull. are they all dull?</li>
<li>been thinking more than i&#39;d like to about <a href="https://olu.online/ai">ai</a>, given i think <a href="https://olu.online/monotony">it&#39;s boring</a>. having good convos with people about it at least. i think some people are using the technology in innovative and interesting ways, i just don&#39;t think it&#39;s the mainstream or popularised view of how you use it, so i will continue not talking about it positively much given the huge ongoing downsides. sloppers don&#39;t interact.</li>
<li>slopper and clanker as words (or concepts?) have brought me so much joy over the last couple of weeks. long live irreverence.</li>
<li>was gonna do payment as my next word given itch.io stuff but i think it has to be either propaganda (cos you&#39;re not immune! even you!) or something i haven&#39;t thought of yet.</li>
<li>my optician roasted me for never looking away fromt eh screen, so been experimenting with a few different apps for reminders, why are they all so expensive? i tried <a href="https://lookaway.app/">lookAway</a>&#39;s trial, and not, i&#39;m trying <a href="https://deskrest.app/">deskRest</a>. let me know if you have any mac (or android) faves?</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been obsessed with finding a colourful and cute backpack with a security pocket, some internal organising pockets, a laptop section and some kind of pocket on the &#34;front&#34;, so far capitalism isn&#39;t delivering! i like mokuyobi style colouring, but not the actual bags that much. i really <em>want</em> to a smaller backpack so i have more options from somewhere like lefrik. if you know of anywhere, yell cos i am probably a few more searches away from spending a year and a ton of money making my own lol. i found <a href="https://sewfisticatedcraft.com/en-gb/products/the-scholars-pack">a cool pattern</a>, but i have a strong suspicion it will be really hard and spendy to make!</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been eating tomatoes, burgers and chips, fig rolls and strawberry laces. i&#39;ve been drinking lattes, builder&#39;s tea with oat milk, blackcurrant cordial with fizzy water, and pineapple and coconut smoothie.</li>
<li>hope you&#39;re having a wonderful weekend. see you soon? ðŸ’Ÿ</li>
