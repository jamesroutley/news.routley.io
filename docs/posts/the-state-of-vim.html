    <h1>The State of Vim</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The death of Bram Moolenaar, <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
founder and benevolent dictator for life (BDFL), in 2023 sent a shock
through the community, and raised concern about the future of the
project. At <a href="https://vimconf.org/">VimConf</a> 2024 in
November, current Vim maintainer Christian Brabandt delivered a
keynote on &#34;<q>the new Vim project</q>&#34; that detailed how the
community has reorganized itself to continue maintaining Vim and what
the future looks like.</p> <h4>Vim after Bram</h4>

<p>Brabandt began with his history with Vim: he has been involved in
Vim since 2006, and said his first commit to the project was made
in the 7.0/7.1 days (sometime around 2006). He started by
contributing small patches and fixes, and then contributed larger
features such as the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/visual.txt.html#gn"><tt>gn</tt> and
<tt>gN</tt> commands</a>, which combine searching and visual-mode
selection, improved cryptographic support using <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/"><tt>libsodium</tt></a>, 
maintained the Vim <a href="https://appimage.org/">AppImage</a>, and
more. He said he became less active in the project around 2022 due to
personal and work-related reasons.</p>

<p>That changed in August 2023, when
Moolenaar <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/940551/">passed
away</a>. Moolenaar had been the maintainer of Vim for more than 30
years; while he had added Brabandt and Ken Takata as
co-maintainers of Vim in the years before, most development still
flowed through him. With his death, a considerable amount of
knowledge was lost—but Brabandt and others stepped up to keep the
project alive.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>Moolenaar was the only owner of the Vim GitHub organization at the
time, so only his account could change certain
settings. Initially, contributors tried to use the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/content/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-deceased-user-policy.md">deceased
user policy</a> to add owners to the organization. That was quite an
involved process, and it soon became apparent that the end result
would be the deactivation of Moolenaar&#39;s account. Having Moolenaar&#39;s
account be accessible by his family was important, so they abandoned
that approach, and instead the family granted access to it as needed
for organizational changes.</p>

<p>Charles Campbell (known as &#34;<a href="http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html">Dr Chip</a>&#34;), a
Vim contributor for more than 25 years also decided to retire
soon after Moolenaar&#39;s death. His departure was followed by an
expansion of the team of maintainers, as Yegappan Lakshmanan joined
it, with Dominique Pellé, Doug Kearns, and GitHub users &#34;glepnir&#34;,
&#34;mattn&#34;, and &#34;zeertzjq&#34; joining soon after.</p>

<h4>More than just the source code</h4>

<p>He stressed that maintaining Vim is not just about the source
code. There are quite a few other things to be managed, such as the
Vim web site, FTP server, security disclosures, Vim communities on
other sites such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/">Reddit</a> and
<a href="https://vi.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a>, and
more.</p>

<p>Vim&#39;s site needed work. The design, and most of the code,
had been unchanged for quite a while—until 2023, it was based on
PHP 5. In recent times, there had been a few occasions where the
web site was unstable, and so he started looking for a new host
in 2024. The move involved an upgrade to PHP 8, for which
some of the code had to be rewritten. Brabandt thanked Mark
Schöchlin, who stepped up to take care of all this.</p>

<p>He acknowledged that the design has been pretty much unchanged
since 2001, doesn&#39;t look modern, and can be scary to new
users. There has been some work on redesigning it, but the first
attempt hasn&#39;t been that successful. He prioritizes consistency and
does not wish to scare away longtime users.</p>

<p>DNS was also troublesome—the <tt>vim.org</tt>
domain was managed by Stefan Zehl, but Moolenaar also owned a number
of other domains such as <tt>vim8.org</tt>, <tt>vim9.org</tt>,
etc. Thankfully, SSL certificates were already managed using Let&#39;s
Encrypt, so Brabandt had no problems there. Several email addresses, such as
<tt>bram@vim.org</tt>, <tt>bugs@vim.org</tt>, etc., were
forwarded to Moolenaar&#39;s personal email; those have since been updated
to point to Brabandt&#39;s address instead. The FTP server was hosted by
<a href="https://nluug.nl/">NLUUG</a>, but he decided to retire
it and says that he hasn&#39;t received any complaints so far.</p>

<h4>ICCF Holland</h4>

<p>As readers might know, Vim is <a href="https://vimhelp.org/uganda.txt.html#license">charityware</a>,
and the charity of choice is <a href="https://iccf-holland.org/">ICCF
Holland</a>, founded by Moolenaar. Brabandt said that the ICCF is very
much alive, and plans to reorganize and restructure itself. Quite a
few users started donating after Moolenaar&#39;s passing, and
in 2023, it raised about €90,000. The project plans to continue
to work with ICCF and doesn&#39;t want to change ICCF&#39;s association with
Vim. He noted that there is no sponsorship for the maintainers, all of
whom are working for free. Traditionally, all money raised has been
given to the ICCF and he has no plans to change that. Brabandt
said he earns enough from his job that he doesn&#39;t need assistance to
work on Vim, so he&#39;s happy to let all donations go to ICCF.</p>

<p>As an incentive to donate, Moolenaar had allowed people who donated
to ICCF to vote on Vim feature requests. Donors to the ICCF could link
to their Vim.org account when donating, and then vote on
features. This is one aspect that he no longer sees a need for,
now that issues and enhancements are discussed on GitHub, and so has
decided to shut this down. Linking the accounts and donations was also
not easy for Brabandt—he was not sure how Moolenaar did this in
the past.</p>

<h4>Communication channels</h4>

<p>He also talked about the community centered around the Vim
mailing lists, which are hosted on Google Groups. In May 2024,
he <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/vim_use/c/skARx2yAEWc/m/U69NrKAgAgAJ">received
an automated message</a> from Google informing him that all
content from the vim-dev list had been blocked due to spam or
malware. This caused a fair bit of trouble, and while it was
restored in around a day or so, he still does not know what the
exact problem was. There has been some consideration of self-hosting the
list, but one drawback is that everyone would have to sign up
again. The mailing list is no longer that active now, with more of the
community conversations happening on Reddit or Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>Security reporting had to be addressed as well. A couple of years
ago, people were reporting issues on <a href="https://huntr.com/repos/vim/vim">the Huntr platform</a>. There
were quite a few open issues which have since been taken care
of. Huntr was acquired by another company in 2023, which
refocused it entirely on AI and shut down general open-source
vulnerability reporting.</p>

<p>Now, Vim is accepting security reports via email or <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/security">GitHub</a>, and publishing
vulnerabilities via GitHub security advisories. There is a
private mailing list for as-yet unpublished security issues, and
emails are forwarded to all maintainers. Brabandt has started adding a
<tt>[security]</tt> tag to commit messages for marking security fixes,
and such commits are announced on the <tt>oss-security</tt> list (the
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/ZwKwrSltz1Zj7wCR@256bit.org">most
recent</a> being from October) and
to maintainers of distribution packages.</p>

<h4>Maintenance mode</h4>

<p>Brabandt then showed the contribution graph, to demonstrate that
development did not stop after Moolenaar passed away. There was a
slowdown as Moolenaar&#39;s health deteriorated, and then a spike as
he cleaned up the open pull requests (PRs). <a href="https://www.vim.org/vim-9.1-released.php">Version 9.1</a>,
dedicated to Moolenaar, was released on
January 2, 2024—about four months after his
passing.</p>

<p>The 9.1 release included improvements to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/textprop.txt.html#virtual-text">virtual text</a> (which
enables completion suggestions and such to appear in the
editing area, while not being part of the actual text), smooth
scrolling, and OpenVMS support. After 9.1, he started adding
more potentially controversial changes, such as support
for <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/">the
XDG base directory specification</a>. Now Vim does not need to litter
your top-level home directory: <tt>~/.vimrc</tt>
or
<tt>~/.vim/vimrc</tt> still work, but <a href="https://vimhelp.org/starting.txt.html#xdg-vimrc"><tt>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim/vimrc</tt></a>
will now work if neither of the above are present. Another such
change is Wayland support. It is not complete yet, and he says he is
not sure whether remaining problems with clipboard support are Vim bugs or 
Wayland ones.</p>

<p>As he went through the backlog of PRs, he started developing
a policy for merging PRs, prioritizing the need to test things well.
Tests are now running with continuous integration (CI). He said that
it&#39;s also important to have good documentation.</p>

<p>Vim has interfaces to quite a few languages, including
Python 2 and 3, Ruby, Lua, Tcl, and MzScheme. But Brabandt
isn&#39;t sure which of these are really needed these days. For example,
Python 2, Tcl, and MzScheme (which does not build
with the latest version of the language) might need to be retired to
reduce the maintenance burden. Other areas to improve include the GUI
(GTK 4 has been around for a while, <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/8038">but Vim does not use
it</a> yet), support for advanced terminal features, and better spell
checking (which has largely remained unchanged since
Vim 7). Support for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree-sitter_%28parser_generator%29">tree-sitter</a>
parser generator is wished-for, but it is controversial, and he does not see it coming to Vim soon.</p>

<p>He knows there have been some significant changes in Neovim, but
he&#39;s not sure how many of those can come to Vim. There have been small
changes in Vim, but for major changes, you need community support. He
does not want to make backward-incompatible changes and is quite
hesitant to merge changes that might break things. He said he has to
keep in the mind the whole picture, especially the expectations of
users, when dealing with PRs. Currently, he said that Vim is
more-or-less in maintenance mode.</p>

<p>He said he has created an internal repository to keep track of
stakeholders and to ensure that if something were to happen to him,
other maintainers could pick up where he left off.</p>

<p>Brabandt recommended that those new to the project 
start by making small contributions and becoming familiar with
the codebase. He had some pointers for developers. He said it is
important to use a defensive style with C to ensure that new bugs
aren&#39;t being introduced. One should use <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity</a>, a static-analysis
tool, to scan for defects. Some parts of the Vim codebase are complex,
he said, and need to be refactored into more manageable units if
possible.</p>

<p>Maintaining Vim is a full-time job, he said, and it is not only
about maintaining the code, but also the community—managing
expectations and listening to users&#39; needs. He has to understand the
community: what does it want Vim to be? An IDE? Bug-for-bug
compatibility with old Vim? How can we
make <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim9.txt.html#Vim9-script">Vim9 script</a>, the
new Vim scripting language, more widely used? How can we ensure that the
Vim community remains healthy? He ended his talk by thanking all
the Vim contributors and then took a few questions.</p>

<h4>Questions</h4>

<p>One audience member asked about the difference between Vim and
Neovim&#39;s maintenance model. Since most PRs are still merged by
Brabandt, would that make him the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">BDFL</a> for Vim?</p>

<p>Brabandt emphatically denied being a BDFL. Currently, he merges
most changes because the version number has to be incremented with
each change, so multiple people merging can introduce
conflicts. However, when he was on vacation, he handed over the main
maintainership to Lakshmanan. He emphasized that it&#39;s a community
project, and he listens to the community before making decisions. It
just happens that at this time the other maintainers don&#39;t want to
merge changes themselves and instead defer to Brabandt, which is fine
with him.</p>

<p>Another member of the audience wondered about language barriers,
since there are many Japanese members of the Vim community as well as
many languages in Europe, etc. Brabandt answered that, as an
international project, the primary language for working on Vim is
English. He also noted that it is easier these days to collaborate
across languages thanks to ChatGPT and translation tools, but it still
happens that some users do not communicate in English well, and that
makes it harder to understand their needs.</p>

<h4>The rest of VimConf 2024</h4>

<p>VimConf was <a href="https://vimconf.org/2013/">first held in 2013</a> by the
Japanese Vim user group <a href="https://vim-jp.org/">vim-jp</a>. Since then, the group has organized
it every year, until 2020 when VimConf was canceled due to COVID.
After a hiatus, it resumed in 2023 with a scaled-down version. The
full-fledged edition returned to Akihabara, Tokyo on
November 23, 2024.</p>

<p>Even though most of the organizers and
attendees are Japanese, VimConf strives to be welcoming to
all. Presentation materials are expected to be in English, and live
translation is provided in both Japanese and English for keynotes and
regular presentations, except for lightning talks. PDFs for the talks
are available on <a href="https://vimconf.org/2024/">VimConf&#39;s
website</a>, and all of the talks are now on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx8bw5NQypsmPvVXXRVmF7bvCjFKv1MuN">YouTube</a>.</p></div></div>
