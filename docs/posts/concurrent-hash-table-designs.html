    <h1>Concurrent Hash Table Designs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>The next milestone is to build a fully thread-safe hash map.</p><p>Up to this point, the focus has been entirely on single-threaded performance: minimizing memory overhead, improving cache locality, and squeezing out every last bit of throughput from the underlying data layout. However, real-world applications rarely stay single-threaded. To be practically useful, a hash map must behave correctly—and efficiently—under concurrent access.</p><p>Before jumping straight into implementation, it’s worth stepping back and studying how existing thread-safe hash map implementations approach this problem. Different designs make different trade-offs between simplicity, scalability, memory usage, and read/write performance. By examining these approaches side by side, we can better understand which ideas scale cleanly—and where the pitfalls are—when multiple threads hit the same structure at once.</p><p>In this part, I’ll walk through the most common strategies used in real-world concurrent hash maps, and highlight the core trade-offs that shape their performance and complexity.</p><h2 id="1-global-lock-the-synchronized-approach">1) Global Lock (the <code>synchronized</code> approach)</h2><p>The most straightforward way to make a hash map thread-safe is to wrap the entire implementation with a single global lock, effectively placing the same synchronization barrier around every public operation.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>V</span><span> </span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>Object</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>synchronized</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>mutex</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>With this approach, <strong>all methods are forced to acquire the exact same lock</strong> before accessing the internal state of the map.</p><p>This includes not only the obvious mutating operations such as <code>put</code> and <code>remove</code>, but also:</p><ul><li><code>get</code>, <code>containsKey</code></li><li><code>resize</code>, <code>rehash</code></li><li><code>clear</code>, <code>size</code></li><li>and essentially every other method that touches the internal data structures</li></ul><p>From a correctness standpoint, this strategy is almost trivial to reason about. Thread safety is guaranteed entirely by the properties provided by the lock itself:</p><ul><li><strong>Mutual exclusion</strong> ensures that only one thread can observe or mutate the map at any given time.</li><li><strong>Happens-before relationships</strong> established by entering and exiting the synchronized block ensure proper memory visibility between threads.</li></ul><p>As a result, there is no need for additional volatile fields, memory fences, or fine-grained coordination logic. The implementation is simple, robust, and very hard to get wrong—which is precisely why this pattern is used by <code>Collections.synchronizedMap</code> and similar wrappers.</p><p>Of course, this simplicity comes at a cost. By serializing <em>all</em> operations behind a single lock, even read-only workloads suffer from contention, effectively reducing the map to single-threaded performance under concurrent access. This trade-off will become especially relevant once we compare this approach to more fine-grained concurrency strategies later on.</p><h3 id="what-a-java-synchronized-block-really-does">What a Java <code>synchronized</code> Block Really Does</h3><p>At the bytecode level, the Java <code>synchronized</code> keyword is surprisingly simple.</p><p>Once compiled, a synchronized block is translated directly into a pair of bytecode instructions:</p><ul><li><code>monitorenter</code>: acquire the monitor associated with an object</li><li><code>monitorexit</code>: release that monitor</li></ul><p>In other words, every synchronized block is built on top of an <strong>object monitor</strong>. A thread must successfully enter the monitor before executing the protected code, and it must exit the monitor when it leaves the block—whether normally or due to an exception.</p><p>However, in HotSpot, this monitor is <strong>not implemented as a single, heavyweight OS mutex</strong> in all cases. Doing so would make synchronized blocks far too expensive for common, low-contention scenarios.</p><p>Instead, HotSpot dynamically adapts its locking strategy based on how much contention it observes. Internally, object monitors transition through different states, most notably:</p><ul><li><strong>Thin locks</strong>, which are optimized for uncontended or lightly contended cases</li><li><strong>Inflated locks</strong>, which are used once contention becomes significant</li></ul><p>This adaptive behavior allows <code>synchronized</code> to be relatively cheap when only one thread (or a small number of threads) is involved, while still remaining correct under heavy contention. Of course, once a lock inflates, the cost becomes much closer to that of a traditional OS-level mutex—a detail that becomes important when evaluating global-lock-based designs for high-concurrency data structures.</p><h3 id="thin-lock-a-lightweight-fast-path">Thin Lock: A Lightweight Fast Path</h3><p>In HotSpot, every Java object starts with a small header. Conceptually, it contains two major pieces:</p><ul><li><strong>mark word</strong>: a header word</li><li><strong>klass pointer:</strong> pointing to the object’s class metadata</li></ul><p>Traditionally, <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.org/spaces/HotSpot/pages/11829266/Synchronization">HotSpot has used this mark word to encode several kinds of runtime metadata</a>—things like the identity hash code, GC age/marking bits, and, crucially for us, <strong>locking state</strong>.</p><p>The diagram below, adapted from <a href="https://jpbempel.github.io/2013/03/25/lock-lock-lock-enter.html">JP Bempel’s excellent write-up</a>, shows the rough layout and how those bits get repurposed depending on the state. The exact lock states and header layout vary across HotSpot versions (for example, biased locking has been removed in recent JDKs); the diagram is provided for intuition, not as a current spec.</p><p><img alt="markword.png" loading="lazy" src="https://bluuewhale.github.io/images/concurrent-hashmap-designs/markword.png"/></p><p>For reference, the current <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/hotspot/share/oops/markWord.hpp#L57">HotSpot source comments</a> describe the mark word states roughly as follows:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="cpp"><span><span><span>//  - the two lock bits are used to describe three states: locked/unlocked and monitor.
</span></span></span><span><span><span>//
</span></span></span><span><span><span>//    [ptr             | 00]  locked    // ptr points to real header on stack (stack-locking)
</span></span></span><span><span><span>//    [header          | 00]  locked    // locked regular object header (fast-locking)
</span></span></span><span><span><span>//    [header          | 01]  unlocked  // regular object header
</span></span></span><span><span><span>//    [ptr             | 10]  monitor   // inflated lock (UseObjectMonitorTable == false)
</span></span></span><span><span><span>//    [header          | 10]  monitor   // inflated lock (UseObjectMonitorTable == true)
</span></span></span><span><span><span>//    [ptr             | 11]  marked    // used for GC marking
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>A <em>thin lock</em> (lightweight lock) uses that header space to avoid allocating a heavyweight monitor in the common case. The basic idea is simple: when a thread enters a <code>synchronized</code> block, the VM creates a <strong>lock record</strong> in the thread’s stack frame, and then tries to “install” a pointer to that lock record into the object’s header via an atomic <strong>compare-and-swap (CAS)</strong>. If the CAS succeeds, the thread owns the lock.</p><p>This is why thin locking is usually cheap: in the uncontended case, it’s essentially a couple of predictable memory operations plus a single atomic instruction—no kernel involvement, no parked threads, and no heavyweight monitor bookkeeping.</p><p>But thin locks also have a natural limit. If two different threads truly contend on the same object at the same time, HotSpot may have to <strong>inflate</strong> the lock into a heavyweight monitor so it can manage a queue of waiting threads safely.</p><h3 id="inflated-lock-the-heavyweight-path">Inflated Lock: The Heavyweight Path</h3><p>When contention becomes significant, a thin lock may no longer be able to make progress efficiently. In that case, HotSpot <strong>inflates</strong> the lock: instead of encoding ownership purely in the object header’s lightweight locking bits, the JVM associates the object with a dedicated runtime monitor structure.</p><p>Once a lock is inflated, ownership tracking and wait-queue management are handled by <strong><code>ObjectMonitor</code></strong>—HotSpot’s internal monitor implementation. The Java object then refers to that monitor either:</p><ul><li>directly via the object’s mark word (the traditional layout), or</li><li><a href="https://wiki.openjdk.org/spaces/HotSpot/pages/138215471/Synchronization+Using+The+ObjectMonitorTable">indirectly via an external mapping table</a> (an <code>ObjectMonitorTable</code>-style association), depending on the HotSpot implementation and configuration.</li></ul><p>This matters because an inflated lock is no longer “just a couple of CAS operations on the header.” It becomes a full-fledged synchronization object that can manage contending threads, queueing, and blocking behavior.</p><p>At the implementation level, <code>ObjectMonitor</code> is a HotSpot runtime class implemented in <strong>native (C++) code</strong> inside the JVM.</p><p>If you skim through the <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/hotspot/share/runtime/objectMonitor.cpp#L506">source</a>, you can see the high-level strategy pretty clearly: contending threads try to enqueue themselves using CAS, may spin briefly, and if the lock still doesn’t become available, they eventually fall back to <strong>parking</strong> (blocking) and later being unparked when the monitor becomes available.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="cpp"><span><span><span>bool</span> <span>ObjectMonitor</span><span>::</span><span>enter</span><span>(</span><span>JavaThread</span><span>*</span> <span>current</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

When contention is high (or the critical section is long), the JVM will eventually take the slow path: it will park the thread, letting the OS scheduler stop running it until it’s explicitly woken up again.</p><p>The exact mechanism depends on the operating system. On POSIX-like platforms (including Linux), HotSpot uses the POSIX backend in <code>os_posix.cpp</code>, where <code>os::PlatformEvent::park()</code> is responsible for blocking the current thread.</p><p>If you look at how <code>os::PlatformEvent::park()</code> is <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/9435d5b89ca08595f0f2f8d029c00bc6d1f30104/src/hotspot/os/posix/os_posix.cpp#L1703C1-L1744C1">implemented on POSIX</a>, you’ll notice that it is built around a classic mutex + condition variable pattern.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Even after you land in <code>pthread_cond_wait()</code>, you’re not dealing with some opaque black box. On Linux, there’s a strong commonality: popular libcs implement pthread condition variables on top of the kernel’s <code>futex</code> (“fast userspace mutex”) mechanism—i.e., the familiar WAIT/WAKE pattern. Both <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/master/nptl/pthread_cond_wait.c#L421">glibc</a> and <a href="https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/thread/__timedwait.c#n52">musl</a> follow this approach.</p><p>A futex is Linux’s kernel-backed primitive for <em>“wait on (and wake from) a value in shared userspace memory”</em>—the low-level building block that higher-level locks/condvars are built on. The man page describes futexes as follows:</p><blockquote><p>The <code>futex()</code> system call provides a method for waiting until a certain condition becomes true. It is typically used as a blocking construct in the context of shared-memory synchronization.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/360699/">LWN</a> has a great diagram showing how the Linux kernel organizes futex waiters once threads fall back to futex-based sleeping:</p><p><img alt="futex" loading="lazy" src="https://bluuewhale.github.io/images/concurrent-hashmap-designs/futex.png"/></p><ul><li>Each futex operation is keyed by a <strong>userspace address</strong> (labeled <em>key A</em>). The kernel derives a <code>futex_key</code> from that address.</li><li>The key is fed into a hash function (<code>hash_futex()</code>), which selects a bucket in the global <strong><code>futex_queues</code> hash table</strong> (hb0 … hbN). Buckets are protected by lightweight locks.</li><li>Inside a bucket, the kernel maintains one or more <code>futex_q</code> lists, each corresponding to a distinct futex key (i.e., a distinct userspace address).</li><li>When a thread calls <code>FUTEX_WAIT</code>, it is enqueued into the <code>futex_q</code> for that key (e.g., Task A1 and A2 both wait on <em>key A</em>, so they end up in the same queue).</li><li>A <code>FUTEX_WAKE</code> on a given address hashes to the same bucket, finds the matching <code>futex_q</code>, and dequeues one or more waiting tasks, making them runnable again.</li></ul><p>The important point is that the kernel does not understand locks or condition variables here. It only manages wait queues indexed by memory addresses. All higher-level semantics (lock state, condition checks, ownership) live entirely in user space; the kernel just provides an efficient “sleep here / wake them up” service keyed by an address.</p><p>If you want to dig deeper into futexes, this <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/basics-of-futexes">write-up</a> is a good place to start.</p><p>This is the key transition point: once we hit the futex slow path, the cost is no longer “just a few CAS retries.” We’re now paying for kernel-assisted blocking and waking, which implies context switches and scheduler involvement—exactly the kind of overhead that global-lock designs can trigger under heavy contention.</p><h3 id="pros--cons">Pros &amp; Cons</h3><p>A single global lock has one obvious appeal: it’s incredibly simple. You don’t need to rethink the data structure or invent a new concurrency protocol—just wrap every operation in the same <code>synchronized</code> (or mutex) barrier and you immediately get mutual exclusion and the memory-visibility guarantees that come with it.</p><p>The downside is that this simplicity buys correctness by throwing away parallelism. Because every operation competes for the same lock, even read-only calls like <code>get()</code> end up blocking each other. In practice that means you get essentially <strong>zero read parallelism</strong>, so a workload that should scale nicely with more reader threads can collapse back into “one thread at a time.”</p><p>Worse, under real contention the cost isn’t just reduced throughput—it can become a latency problem. As contention increases, HotSpot tends to fall back to progressively heavier synchronization paths. What begins as a lightweight fast path can escalate into monitor inflation and eventually into <strong>parking</strong>, where threads actually block and rely on the OS scheduler to be woken up later. Once you’re in that regime, lock acquisition stops looking like “a few failed CAS attempts” and starts looking like “context switches and scheduler overhead,” which can make tail latency spike dramatically when many threads pile up behind a single global lock.</p><blockquote><p>If you’d like a deeper dive into the trade-offs between spinning and blocking—especially what actually drives the overhead difference between spinlocks and mutex-style locks—this article is a solid reference: <a href="https://howtech.substack.com/p/spinlocks-vs-mutexes-when-to-spin">Spinlocks vs. Mutexes: When to Spin and When to Sleep</a></p></blockquote><h2 id="2-lock-striping--sharding-dashmap-style">2) Lock Striping / Sharding (DashMap-style)</h2><p>After the “one big lock” approach, the next most common step up is to <strong>split contention across multiple locks</strong>.</p><p>With <strong>lock striping</strong>, you pre-create a fixed number of locks—say N—and deterministically map each key to one of them. Conceptually it looks like:</p><ul><li>keep <code>N</code> locks around,</li><li>compute <code>stripe = hash(key) % N</code> (typically with <code>N</code> as a power of two),</li><li>and then only acquire the lock for that particular stripe while performing the operation.</li></ul><p>The payoff is immediate: operations that fall into different stripes can run concurrently, which gives you real scalability compared to a single global lock. The trade-off is that the mapping is coarse-grained: two completely unrelated keys can still end up on the same stripe, and then they’ll block each other anyway—purely due to a stripe collision. <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/StripedExplained">Guava’s <code>Striped</code></a> utility is a widely used, reusable implementation of this pattern.</p><p>If striping is “multiple locks around one shared data structure,” <strong>sharding</strong> usually goes one step further: you split the data structure itself. Instead of one big map guarded by many locks, you keep multiple independent maps (or tables), each with its own lock, and route each key to exactly one shard based on its hash.</p><h3 id="dashmap">DashMap</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/xacrimon/dashmap">Rust’s <strong>DashMap</strong></a> is a well-known example of this design. Internally it maintains an array of shards, and each shard combines “its own table + its own lock” (commonly described as a per-shard <code>RwLock&lt;HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;&gt;</code> in the mental model). The shard is chosen from the key’s hash, so operations targeting different shards generally don’t interfere with each other.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>DashMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>K</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>V</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>S</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>RandomState</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

The motivation is simple: even inside the same shard, <strong>read–read access can proceed concurrently</strong>. That can be a big win for read-heavy workloads, where you’d otherwise serialize a huge fraction of operations for no real reason.</p><p>Of course, RW locks come with their own trade-offs. Depending on the implementation and scheduling policy, they can suffer from <strong>writer starvation</strong> (writers being delayed indefinitely under a steady stream of readers), and they also introduce <strong>extra overhead</strong> compared to a simple mutex—both in terms of lock bookkeeping and in the complexity of the fast path. So while RW locking improves parallelism for reads, it’s not automatically a net win; you still have to evaluate it in the context of the expected workload and contention patterns.</p><h3 id="a-small-trick-for-shard-selection-in-swisstable-based-maps">A Small Trick for Shard Selection in SwissTable-based Maps</h3><p>DashMap uses hashbrown (SwissTable) internally, so it deliberately avoids consuming the top 7 hash bits when selecting a shard—those bits are reserved for SwissTable’s SIMD tag (H2).

(A Subtle but Crucial Optimization)</h3><p>In Rust, <code>Box&lt;[T]&gt;</code> is an owned slice: conceptually, it represents a single heap allocation large enough to hold <code>len * size_of::&lt;T&gt;()</code> bytes (for non–zero-sized <code>T</code>), with the elements laid out contiguously as <code>T, T, T, ...</code>. On the stack you keep a “fat pointer” (data pointer + length), but the backing storage itself is one contiguous block on the heap.</p><p>Now consider what a sharded design often looks like: a contiguous array of shards, where each shard is something like an <code>RwLock&lt;HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;&gt;</code>. Conceptually, an <code>RwLock&lt;T&gt;</code> stores the lock state (atomics/flags, bookkeeping for waiters, etc.) alongside the protected value <code>T</code>—in this case, a <code>HashMap</code>—as part of a single structure.</p><p>If those shards are then stored in something like a boxed slice, they end up adjacent in memory, sitting next to each other in a tightly packed layout.</p><p>That tight packing can backfire under contention. Lock state tends to be updated very frequently and those updates can cause <strong>false sharing</strong>: independent shards that happen to live on the same cache line can end up invalidating each other’s cache lines, creating unnecessary cache-line bouncing across cores.</p><p><code>CachePadded&lt;T&gt;</code> is a pragmatic fix for this. It wraps a value and adds enough <strong>padding and alignment</strong> so that it is much more likely to occupy its own cache line, reducing false sharing between neighboring lock states. This doesn’t change the algorithm, but it can significantly improve real-world throughput when many threads hammer different shards concurrently.</p><h3 id="whats-a-cache-line-anyway">What’s a Cache Line, Anyway?</h3><p>A <strong>cache line</strong> is the basic unit the CPU cache uses to <strong>move data around</strong> and to <strong>maintain coherence</strong> between cores. When people talk about “cache-friendly” layouts or “cache-line bouncing,” this is the granularity they’re referring to.</p><p>On most modern mainstream CPUs, a cache line is typically 64 bytes.</p><p>The key detail is that CPUs don’t fetch memory one byte at a time. When a core reads from memory, it usually pulls in the <strong>entire cache line</strong> containing that address. So even if your code only touches an 8-byte value, the CPU may load the surrounding bytes as well—up to a full 64B line—because that’s the unit of transfer.</p><p>This design is a direct bet on <strong>spatial locality</strong>: if you accessed one address, chances are you’ll soon access nearby addresses too, so pulling in adjacent bytes often pays off.</p><p>But the same mechanism is also what makes <strong>false sharing</strong> possible.</p><h3 id="what-is-false-sharing">What is False Sharing?</h3><p>To understand false sharing, it helps to remember how caches work at the hardware level: when a CPU reads from memory, it doesn’t pull in a single byte or a single integer—it pulls in a fixed-size <strong>cache line</strong>.</p><p>That “fixed-size chunk” detail has an unintuitive consequence. Two small, completely unrelated pieces of data—say two <code>int32</code>s—can end up sitting next to each other in memory, and therefore inside the <strong>same cache line</strong>.</p><p>Now imagine two different CPU cores, each running a different thread, and each thread repeatedly updates one of those variables:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>// Assume x and y are in the same cache line</span><span>

Thread 1 touches <code>x</code>, thread 2 touches <code>y</code>, end of story.</p><p>But the cache coherence protocol doesn’t track ownership at the level of individual variables—it tracks it at the level of <strong>cache lines</strong>. When one core modifies <em>any</em> byte within a cache line, that line has to transition into a writable state for that core, and other cores’ cached copies of the same line may be <strong>invalidated</strong>. So even though the threads never touch the same variable, they keep fighting over <em>ownership of the same cache line</em>. The line bounces back and forth between cores, and performance collapses.</p><p>That is <strong>false sharing</strong>: independent variables “accidentally” share a cache line, and the hardware ends up treating them like shared data because coherence is managed at cache-line granularity.</p><p>Below is a practical illustration from the <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/seeing-through-hardware-counters-a-journey-to-threefold-performance-increase-2721924a2822">Netflix Tech Blog</a> showing how false sharing happens at cache-line granularity.</p><p><img alt="false-sharing" loading="lazy" src="https://bluuewhale.github.io/images/concurrent-hashmap-designs/false-sharing.png"/></p><p>False sharing shows up as a very real microarchitectural tax. Once two cores start bouncing the same cache line back and forth, every write forces coherence traffic and invalidations, and the affected cores spend more time <strong>waiting</strong> for the line to arrive in the right coherence state. That waiting manifests as <strong>pipeline stalls</strong>, which in turn drives <strong>CPI (cycles per instruction)</strong> up—your loop is still “doing the same amount of work,” but it’s retiring far fewer useful instructions per cycle.</p><p>At the same time, the cache hierarchy gets hammered. Because the line keeps getting invalidated and re-fetched, you end up repeatedly evicting and reloading the same 64-byte line. Even though the data set is tiny, the system is effectively forced into a high-frequency “empty and refill” pattern, pushing up the effective <strong>bandwidth pressure</strong> on the caches and the coherence interconnect. In practice, this can look like inflated L1/L2/L3 traffic and reduced headroom for everything else running on the machine.</p><p>If you want to go deeper on how false sharing shows up in real systems, Netflix has a fantastic <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/seeing-through-hardware-counters-a-journey-to-threefold-performance-increase-2721924a2822">write-up</a> that’s well worth reading.</p><h2 id="3-the-java-8-concurrenthashmap-approach">3) The Java 8+ ConcurrentHashMap Approach</h2><p>Java’s <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> (CHM) takes a very different approach from both global locking and classic sharding. Its core philosophy can be summarized as:</p><blockquote><p>“Do as much work as possible with CAS, fall back to locking only when absolutely necessary—and even then, lock only a tiny portion of the structure. When resizing is required, let multiple threads cooperate to get it done.”</p></blockquote><p>At the heart of the data structure is a single, volatile array:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>transient</span><span> </span><span>volatile</span><span> </span><span>Node</span><span>&lt;</span><span>K</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>V</span><span>&gt;[]</span><span> </span><span>table</span><span>;</span><span>

Each element in the array is called a <strong>bin</strong>, and each bin holds the entries whose hashes map to that index.</p><p>In the common case, a bin is implemented as a simple <strong>linked list</strong> of <code>Node&lt;K, V&gt;</code> instances. However, when collisions become severe and a bin grows beyond a certain threshold, CHM dynamically converts that bin into a <strong>red–black tree</strong> (represented internally by <code>TreeBin</code> and <code>TreeNode</code>). This adaptive behavior keeps lookup time bounded even under adversarial or highly skewed hash distributions.</p><p>The table size itself is always maintained as a <strong>power of two</strong>, chosen as the smallest power-of-two capacity that can hold the requested number of entries.

This fine-grained design is what allows <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> to scale well under high concurrency without relying on coarse global locks.</p><h3 id="how-concurrenthashmapput-works">How <code>ConcurrentHashMap.put()</code> Works</h3><p><code>ConcurrentHashMap.put()</code> is built around a simple idea: try to finish the operation with a cheap, CAS step first, and only if that fails, fall back to locking—and even then, lock as little as possible.</p><p>It starts by hashing the key and computing the target bin index using a power-of-two mask (<code>(n - 1) &amp; hash</code>). If the corresponding slot in the table is empty, <code>put()</code> takes the fastest route: it attempts to install the first <code>Node</code> into that bin with a single CAS. When this succeeds, the insertion completes without taking any locks at all.</p><p>If the bin isn’t empty, the next question is whether it’s even safe to insert there. When the first node indicates a <code>MOVED</code> state, the map is in the middle of a resize, so <code>put()</code> doesn’t blindly mutate the old table. Instead it follows the forwarding logic—typically helping with the transfer or retrying the operation against the new table.</p><p>In the normal case (not <code>MOVED</code>), <code>put()</code> does a quick check on the bin’s head node as a small fast path. But if it can’t resolve the update immediately, it falls back to the contended path: it synchronizes on the bin’s first node and performs the insertion while holding that monitor. This is the key design point—locking is scoped to a single bin, not the entire map.</p><p>Inside that tiny critical section, the actual insertion depends on how the bin is represented. If it’s still a linked list, it walks the nodes in order, updating the value if the key already exists or appending a new node otherwise. If the bin has been treeified, the head points to a <code>TreeBin</code> wrapper and the operation becomes a red–black tree lookup/insert over <code>TreeNode</code> instead. Either way, the important part is that contention is localized: threads inserting into different bins can proceed independently, and even heavy contention only serializes threads that collide on the same bin.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>final</span><span> </span><span>V</span><span> </span><span>putVal</span><span>(</span><span>K</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>V</span><span> </span><span>value</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>boolean</span><span> </span><span>onlyIfAbsent</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

The goal is straightforward: once collision chains get long, linear scans become expensive, so CHM switches to a structure with bounded lookup/insertion cost.</p><p>That said, treeification is <em>not</em> unconditional. If the overall table is still “too small,” CHM will usually resize the table instead of treeifying the bin.

This extra check after acquiring the lock is reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-checked_locking#:~:text=In%20software%20engineering%2C%20double%2Dchecked,first%20time%20it%20is%20accessed"><strong>double-checked locking</strong></a></p><p>Finally, the conversion itself is mechanical: it walks the existing linked list and rebuilds it as a chain of <code>TreeNode</code>s, then installs a <code>TreeBin</code> wrapper into <code>table[index]</code> to represent the new tree-based bin.</p><h3 id="why--concurrenthashmap-can-afford-a-simple-hash-spread">Why ConcurrentHashMap Can Afford a Simple Hash Spread</h3><p>Treeification gives <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> a useful “safety net” against pathological collisions. Once a bin gets too large, CHM can convert it from a linked list into a balanced tree, which bounds the lookup/insert cost for that bin to <strong>O(log n)</strong> rather than degrading all the way to linear scans. In other words, even under high-collision scenarios, the data structure becomes <em>much less sensitive</em> to long collision chains because the probe length stops growing linearly with the number of colliding keys.</p><p>This property also influences how much effort CHM needs to spend on “perfectly spreading” hashes. Since the implementation has a backstop that prevents bins from becoming arbitrarily slow, it can afford to keep the hash-spreading step relatively lightweight—typically just a small bit-mixing function before applying the power-of-two mask.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>static</span><span> </span><span>final</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>spread</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>h</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>And that matters because in low-level data structures like hash maps, the cost of hashing is often a meaningful part of the total CPU budget. In many workloads, you’re not just paying for a couple of pointer-chases—you’re also paying to compute hashes (sometimes repeatedly), and that work can dominate or at least noticeably affect end-to-end performance.</p><h3 id="poisson-bin-sizes-in-the-normal-case">Poisson Bin Sizes in the “Normal” Case</h3><p>One of the more interesting details is that <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>’s own source comments explicitly argue that, in realistic workloads with <em>well-distributed</em> hashes, long bins are statistically rare. Under <em>random hash codes</em>, and assuming a resize threshold (load factor) of <strong>0.75</strong>, the distribution of bin sizes is said to be well-approximated by a <strong>Poisson distribution with λ ≈ 0.5</strong> (with the caveat that resizing granularity introduces large variance).</p><p>If you ignore that variance and just plug λ = 0.5 into the Poisson PMF, you get the familiar table that the comment itself lists:</p><ul><li><strong>k = 0:</strong> 0.6065 → about <strong>60.65% of bins are empty</strong></li><li><strong>k = 1:</strong> 0.3033 → about <strong>30.33% have exactly one entry</strong></li><li><strong>k = 2:</strong> 0.0758 → about <strong>7.58% have two</strong></li><li><strong>k = 3:</strong> 0.0126 → about <strong>1.26% have three</strong></li><li><strong>k = 4:</strong> 0.00158 → about <strong>0.158% have four</strong></li><li><strong>k = 5:</strong> 0.000158 → about <strong>0.0158% have five</strong></li><li><strong>k ≥ 8:</strong> <strong>less than one in ten million</strong></li></ul><p>This is the statistical justification for CHM’s “bin-local” design. Even though updates may occasionally synchronize on a bin head (and bins start out as linked lists), in the common case—where hashes are sufficiently well spread—<strong>most bins stay very short</strong>, and contention is naturally limited to a tiny fraction of the table.</p><p>Treeification, in that framing, is not really about improving the <em>average</em> case of healthy workloads. It only becomes relevant once a bin grows past an unusually large threshold (default <strong>8</strong>), and even then it’s treated more like a last resort than a default strategy. In practice, you can think of it as a <strong>defensive mechanism</strong>: it caps performance degradation in scenarios where collisions become abnormally severe—bad <code>hashCode()</code> implementations, skewed key distributions, or deliberate hash-flooding-style behavior—rather than something CHM expects to rely on routinely.</p><h3 id="a-detour-into-unsafe-how-chm-touches-table-without-normal-java-array-access">A Detour into <code>Unsafe</code>: How CHM Touches <code>table[]</code> Without “Normal” Java Array Access</h3><p>If you look closely at the hottest parts of <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>, you’ll notice something slightly unusual: it <em>does not</em> read and write <code>table[i]</code> using the ordinary <code>tab[i]</code> bytecode sequence.</p><p>Instead, it routes almost all element access through three helpers:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>@SuppressWarnings</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;unchecked&#34;</span><span>)</span><span>

At that point, the JVM treats the operation as a raw memory access: <strong>no range check is inserted, because the responsibility has shifted to the programmer</strong>.</p><p>This is not “free performance.” It is a deliberate trade-off.</p><p>Using <code>Unsafe</code> means the JVM no longer protects you from out-of-bounds access. If the index calculation is wrong, the failure mode is no longer a clean <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>, but memory corruption or a VM crash. In other words, <code>Unsafe</code> does not <em>optimize</em> bounds checks—it <strong>opts out of them</strong>.</p><p>For code like <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>, this trade-off is acceptable. The index invariants are carefully maintained, heavily tested, and relied upon by the entire implementation. Avoiding redundant bounds checks in the hottest paths helps keep the common-case fast path as short and predictable as possible.</p><p>Unsafe is therefore best understood not as a general-purpose performance hammer, but as a <strong>precision tool</strong>: useful when the compiler cannot prove safety, but the programmer can.</p><h3 id="element-count-fast-updates-expensive-reads-and-a-resize-heuristic">Element Count: Fast Updates, Expensive Reads (and a Resize Heuristic)</h3><p><code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> has an interesting problem to solve: it needs some notion of “how many elements are in the map,” but it can’t afford to turn every <code>put()</code> into a scalability bottleneck.

Updates try to hit the fast path first (CAS on the base), and when contention is detected, the map “fans out” into multiple <code>CounterCell</code> so different threads can increment different cells concurrently. The source comment explicitly calls this “a specialization of LongAdder,” and notes that it relies on contention-sensing to decide when to create more cells.</p><p>The catch is exactly what you wrote: <strong>updates are cheap, but an accurate read is not</strong>.

Instead, it uses a simple heuristic to make the expensive counter read <em>rare</em>: <strong>under contention, resizing is only attempted when adding to a bin that already contains two or more nodes</strong> (i.e., when you’re inserting into a “collided bin,” not an empty/singleton bin).</p><p>The comment even quantifies the benefit</p><blockquote><p>To avoid reading so often, resizing under contention is attempted only upon adding to a bin already holding two or more nodes.

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="cooperative-resize-sharing-the-rehash-work">Cooperative Resize: Sharing the Rehash Work</h3><p><code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> also has a distinctive mechanism for resizing: <strong>cooperative resize</strong>. Instead of making a single thread perform the entire rehash/transfer in one long, monolithic step, CHM spreads the work across multiple threads. Threads doing ordinary operations—<code>put</code>, <code>remove</code>, and even some reads—can detect that a resize is in progress and then help move a small chunk of bins into the new table. In effect, the resize is completed <strong>in parallel</strong>, incrementally, by the threads that are already interacting with the map.</p><p>This design has a few practical benefits. It avoids a stop-the-world style “everything stalls while we resize” phase, and it prevents one unlucky thread from paying the entire resize cost alone. More importantly, even if a resize takes a while under sustained updates, CHM can install <strong><code>ForwardingNode</code></strong> to redirect operations toward the new table, which helps keep the map responsive and reduces the risk of tail-latency blowups.</p><p>I’ll stop here for now—CHM’s resize protocol is deep enough that it deserves its own dedicated section, and including all the details here would make this part unnecessarily long.</p><h2 id="4-lock-free-open-addressing-cliff-clicks-nonblockinghashmap">4) Lock-Free Open Addressing (Cliff Click’s <code>NonBlockingHashMap</code>)</h2><p>So far we’ve covered three concurrency strategies:</p><ul><li>one global lock (<code>synchronizedMap</code>)</li><li>sharding (<code>DashMap</code>-style)</li><li>and Java’s <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> (CAS-first, bin-local locking, cooperative resize)</li></ul><p>Cliff Click’s <code>NonBlockingHashMap</code> (NBHM) explores a fourth point in the design space: an <strong>open-addressed hash table</strong> where updates are coordinated via <strong>CAS-based slot claiming</strong>, and resizing is handled by <strong>cooperative copying</strong> rather than a stop-the-world phase.</p><p>The class header doesn’t hide its ambition: it explicitly positions itself as a lock-free alternative to <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>, emphasizing non-blocking updates and scalability under high update rates. In fact, the comment is <em>extremely</em> confident about scalability, claiming linear scaling “up to 768 CPUs on a 768-CPU Azul box,” even under 100% updates or 100% reads.</p><p>I’m not treating these numbers as gospel—they depend heavily on workload, JVM, and hardware—but the claim is still a useful signal.

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>One subtle choice here is why <code>CHM</code> is stored inside <code>_kvs</code> instead of having <code>_kvs</code> inside <code>CHM</code>. The comment spells it out:</p><blockquote><p>The <code>CHM</code> info is used during resize events and updates, but not during standard ‘get’ operations. I assume ‘get’ is much more frequent than ‘put’. ‘get’ can skip the extra indirection of skipping through the <code>CHM</code> to reach the <code>_kvs</code> array.</p></blockquote><h3 id="a-note-on-the-internal-chm-control-plane">A Note on the Internal <code>CHM</code>: Control Plane</h3><p>One slightly confusing aspect of <code>NonBlockingHashMap</code> is the presence of a nested class called <code>CHM</code>.

Only when the hashes match (or when the hash is still zero) does it fall back to a full key comparison.</p><p>This matters because <code>equals()</code> is often the most expensive operation in the probe loop:</p><ul><li>it is a virtual call,</li><li>it may be megamorphic under mixed key types,</li><li>and it often involves additional memory reads inside the key object.</li></ul><p>In contrast, reading <code>hashes[idx]</code> is just a single load from a dense <code>int[]</code>, which is far more cache- and JIT-friendly.</p><blockquote><p>If you want a concrete example of how much <code>Objects.equals</code> can hurt hash map performance on the hot path, I wrote up a detailed case study in <a href="https://bluuewhale.github.io/posts/further-optimizing-my-java-swiss-table/#2-why-didnt-hotspot-c2-compiler-devirtualize-objectsequalsa-b">my previous post</a>.</p></blockquote><h3 id="a-familiar-idea-if-youve-seen-swisstable">A Familiar Idea if You’ve Seen SwissTable</h3><p>Conceptually, this optimization is strikingly similar to SwissTable’s design.</p><p>SwissTable also tries very hard to avoid expensive key comparisons on the hot path. Instead of storing full hashes, it stores a small fingerprint (<code>H2</code>) in a compact metadata array. Lookups first compare these fingerprints in bulk; only candidate slots proceed to a full key comparison.</p><p>The underlying idea is the same in both designs:</p><blockquote><p>Use a cheap, cache-friendly hash-derived check to rule out most mismatches before touching the actual key.</p></blockquote><p>NBHM uses a full <code>int</code> hash per slot; SwissTable uses a compact 7-bit tag packed into control bytes. The data layout and SIMD tricks differ, but the motivation is identical: push expensive work (<code>equals</code>, pointer chasing) as far off the hot path as possible.</p><p>Seen in that light, <code>hashes[]</code> in <code>NonBlockingHashMap</code> is not just a micro-optimization—it’s an early example of the same principle that SwissTable later takes much further with explicit metadata arrays and vectorized probing.</p><h3 id="unsafe-everywhere-element-level-cas-on-keys-and-values">Unsafe Everywhere: Element-level CAS on Keys and Values</h3><p>NBHM doesn’t use <code>AtomicReferenceArray</code>.

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Two core invariants fall out of this:</p><ul><li>Once a value is boxed (<code>Prime</code>), the old slot becomes effectively read-only.</li><li>Promotion is safe because NBHM can count <strong>null → non-null transitions</strong> in the new table (i.e., confirmed copies).</li></ul><h3 id="the-trade-off-non-blocking--no-contention">The Trade-off: Non-blocking != No Contention</h3><p>NBHM avoids explicit locks, but it does not eliminate contention—it mostly <strong>moves</strong> it. Instead of “threads queue behind a lock,” contention shows up as cache-line ownership traffic from CAS, coherence, and the occasional global coordination step.</p><p>That said, the implementation is clearly trying to <strong>keep that contention from concentrating in one place</strong>. The high-frequency counters (<code>_slots</code>, <code>_size</code>) are not single hot variables; they are <code>Counter</code>s backed by <code>ConcurrentAutoTable</code>, which shards updates in a <code>LongAdder</code>/<code>CounterCell</code>-like way. And the resize coordination counters (<code>_copyIdx</code>, <code>_copyDone</code>) are not bumped on every copied entry—they advance in coarse chunks (e.g., per ~1024 slots of copy work), keeping the shared-state traffic relatively infrequent.</p><p>This matters because it directly intersects with SwissTable-style metadata. If you bolt on <em>high-frequency</em> metadata writes (e.g., control bytes updated on every operation), you can still recreate the failure mode people warned about: false sharing at cache-line granularity—now layered on top of a code path that already pays for CAS and coherence under contention.</p><hr/><h2 id="5-closing-thoughts">5) Closing Thoughts</h2><p>Global locking, sharding, <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>, and Cliff Click’s <code>NonBlockingHashMap</code> (NBHM) outline four very different ways to approach concurrency in a hash map. Each draws its contention boundary in a different place, and each pays for that choice with a different mix of simplicity, scalability, and implementation complexity.</p><p>The important takeaway is not that one approach is universally better, but that <strong>the shape of the data structure largely determines which concurrency strategies are viable</strong>. Techniques that work well for bucketed, pointer-based maps do not always translate cleanly to open-addressing designs, and vice versa.</p><p>In the next part, I’ll switch gears and look at how these ideas informed the design of <strong>SwissMap</strong>. Rather than re-implementing any one of these strategies wholesale, SwissMap selectively borrows from them—combining sharding, optimistic fast paths, and carefully chosen locking boundaries (while staying mindful of NBHM-style coherence costs) to fit the constraints of a SwissTable-style layout.</p><h2 id="ps-if-you-want-the-code">P.S. If you want the code</h2><p>This post is basically the narrative version of an experiment I’m building in public: <a href="https://github.com/bluuewhale/hash-smith"><strong>HashSmith</strong></a>, a small collection of fast, memory-efficient hash tables for the JVM.</p><p><code>ConcurrentSwissMap</code> is still a work in progress. I’m planning to iterate on the design a bit more, run a proper set of benchmarks, and share the results in a follow-up post once things stabilize.</p></div></article></div></div>
