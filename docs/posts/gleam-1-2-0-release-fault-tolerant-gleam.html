    <h1>Gleam 1.2.0 release – Fault tolerant Gleam</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page">

  <p>
    Published 27 May, 2024 by Louis Pilfold
  </p>
<p>Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v1.2.0">v1.2.0</a> has been published, a release
that focuses on improving the language server and developer experience. It’s a
big one both in terms of size and impact, so let’s take a look as what it
includes.</p>

<h2 id="fault-tolerant-compilation">Fault tolerant compilation</h2>

<p>Gleam’s compiler has traditionally halted immediately when a compile time error
was encountered, presenting the error to the programmer and requiring them to
fix it before compilation can be attempted again.</p>

<p>The main advantage of this is that the programmer has just the first and
most important error, rather than a mix of the real error and a bunch of
red-herring cascading errors. On the other hand, if there’s multiple genuine
errors the programmer can only see first the one, which may not be the one they
want to work on, or the most understandable.</p>

<p>Even worse, this halting behaviour causes major issues for the Gleam Language
Server (the engine that text editors like Neovim, Helix, Zed, and VS Code use to
get IDE features for Gleam). The language server internally uses the compiler to
build and analyse Gleam projects, so when the compiler halts with an error the
language server is left without up-to-date information about the code. Without a
successful build some language server features may not work, and the longer a
project goes without successful compilation (such as during a large refactoring)
the more drift there can be between the language server’s understanding of the
code and the reality.</p>

<p>With this release when the compiler encounters an error during analysis it will
move on to the next definition in the module, returning all of the errors along
with updated code information once the whole module has been analysed. This has
resulted in a dramatic improvement in the experience when using the Gleam
language server, it being much more responsive and accurate in its feedback.</p>

<p>In future releases we will continue to improve the granularity of the fault
tolerant compilation and we will also introduce fault tolerant parsing.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Acepie">Ameen Radwan</a> and myself for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="language-server-imports-improvements">Language server imports improvements</h2>

<p>This is a Gleam import statement:</p>
<pre><code>import gleam/option.{type Option, Some, None}
//     ^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//      the module     unqualified imports
</code></pre>

<p>The language server could previously autocomplete module names, but now it can
also autocomplete types and values when importing them in the unqualified
fashion.</p>

<p>You can also hover types and values in an import statement to see their
documentation, and use go-to definition on them and the module itself to jump
to where they defined in your project or its dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="single-line-pipelines">Single line pipelines</h2>

<p>Gleam’s much loved <code>|&gt;</code> pipe operator can be used to pipe the output from one
function into the input of another, not dissimilar to <code>|</code> pipes in bash, etc.
Gleam’s code formatter would always put each function of a sequence of pipes on
individual lines, but now you can opt to put them all on one line, so long as
altogether they are short enough to fit.</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3] |&gt; list.map(int.to_string) |&gt; string.join(with: &#34;\n&#34;)
</code></pre>

<p>In addition you can also force the formatter to break a pipe on multiple lines
by adding a line break. This:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3] |&gt; list.map(int.to_string)
// By putting a newline here I&#39;m telling the formatter to split the pipeline
|&gt; string.join(with: &#34;\n&#34;)
</code></pre>

<p>Will turn into this:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3]
|&gt; list.map(int.to_string)
|&gt; string.join(with: &#34;\n&#34;)
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you to our formatter wizard <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a>
for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="improved-error-messages-for-use-expressions">Improved error messages for <code>use</code> expressions</h2>

<p>Gleam’s <a href="https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use-sugar/"><code>use</code> expressions</a>
are very powerful and can be used to replicate many built-in features of other
languages such as Go’s <code>defer</code>, procedural languages’ early returns, Haskell’s
do-notation, and more. As an unusual and powerful feature they can be confusing
at first, and that was made worse as any type errors from incorrect <code>use</code>
expressions would be generic ones rather than being specific to <code>use</code>.</p>

<p>These errors have been greatly refined and we hope this will help folks learning
the language and debugging their code. Here’s some specific examples:</p>

<p>This error message is used when the right-hand-side of <code>&lt;-</code> in a <code>use</code>
expression is not a function:</p>
<pre><code>error: Type mismatch
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:2:8
  │
2 │ use &lt;- 123
  │        ^^^

In a use expression, there should be a function on the right hand side of
`&lt;-`, but this value has type:

    Int

See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use/
</code></pre>

<p>This error message is used when the right-hand-side of <code>&lt;-</code> is a function,
but it takes no arguments:</p>
<pre><code>error: Incorrect arity
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:3:8
  │
3 │ use &lt;- func
  │        ^^^^ Expected no arguments, got 1

The function on the right of `&lt;-` here takes no arguments.
But it has to take at least one argument, a callback function.

See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use/
</code></pre>

<p>And this one is used when it takes arguments, but not the correct number of
arguments:</p>
<pre><code>error: Incorrect arity
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:3:8
  │
3 │ use &lt;- f(1, 2)
  │        ^^^^^^^ Expected 2 arguments, got 3

The function on the right of `&lt;-` here takes 2 arguments.
All the arguments have already been supplied, so it cannot take the
`use` callback function as a final argument.

See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use/
</code></pre>

<p>And more! Too many to list here. Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a>
for these big improvements!</p>

<h2 id="typevalue-mix-up-feedback">Type/value mix up feedback</h2>

<p>One common mistake is to try and import a type as a value, or a value as a type.
When an imported item is found not to exist the compiler will now check to see
if there is a matching type or value and explain the mix-up.</p>
<pre><code>error: Unknown module field
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:1:19
  │
1 │ import gleam/one.{One}
  │                   ^^^ Did you mean `type One`?

`One` is only a type, it cannot be imported as a value.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>error: Unknown module type
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:1:19
  │
1 │ import gleam/two.{type Two}
  │                   ^^^^^^^^ Did you mean `Two`?

`Two` is only a value, it cannot be imported as a type.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/Pi-Cla/">Pi-Cla</a> for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="assertion-exhaustiveness-checking">Assertion exhaustiveness checking</h2>

<p>Gleam has a <code>let assert</code> syntax to apply a pattern to a value, extracting values
contained within if the pattern matches, and crashing the program if it does
not.</p>

<p>The compiler now performs exhaustiveness checking on these assertions to find
patterns that are total and warn that the <code>assert</code> is redundant as a result.</p>
<pre><code>warning: Redundant assertion
  ┌─ /home/lucy/src/app/src/app.gleam:4:7
  │
4 │   let assert x = get_name()
  │       ^^^^^^ You can remove this

This assertion is redundant since the pattern covers all possibilities.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature.</p>

<h2 id="catching-common-crash-mistakes">Catching common crash mistakes</h2>

<p>Gleam has <code>todo</code> and <code>panic</code> expressions, both of which crash the program due to
it being incomplete or in an invalid state respectively. The syntax looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>panic as &#34;The session is no longer valid, this should never happen!&#34;
</code></pre>

<p>A common mistake is to try and give the message string using the function call
syntax like so:</p>
<pre><code>panic(&#34;The session is no longer valid, this should never happen!&#34;)
</code></pre>

<p>This is valid Gleam code, but it is not using that string as a message for the
panic. The string unreachable as the program panics before it is evaluated. A
compiler warning is now emitted when code like this is found.</p>
<pre><code>warning: Todo used as a function
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:2:16
  │
2 │           todo(1)
  │                ^

`todo` is not a function and will crash before it can do anything with
this argument.

Hint: if you want to display an error message you should write
`todo as &#34;my error message&#34;`
See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/todo/
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="invalid-constant-error-message-improvement">Invalid constant error message improvement</h2>

<p>Gleam’s constants are limited to a subset of the language that be evaluated at
compile time, and as such arbitrary functions cannot be called within them.
Previously if you tried to call a function you would get a somewhat confusing
parse error, but with this version it’ll emit a much more helpful error message.</p>
<pre><code>error: Syntax error
  ┌─ /src/parse/error.gleam:3:18
  │
3 │ const wib: Int = wibble(1, &#34;wobble&#34;)
  │                  ^^^^^^^ Functions can only be called within other functions
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/nino">Nino Annighoefer</a> for this improvement!</p>

<h2 id="unreachable-code-detection">Unreachable code detection</h2>

<p>Code that comes after a <code>panic</code> expression is unreachable and will never be
evaluated as the program will crash before it is reached. The compiler will now
warn in these situations to catch these mistakes.</p>

<p>For example, this code will emit this warning:</p>

<pre><code>pub fn main() {
  panic
  my_app.run()
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>warning: Unreachable code
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:3:11
  │
3 │    my_app.run()
  │    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

This code is unreachable because it comes after a `panic`.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="further-hex-integration">Further Hex integration</h2>

<p>Gleam is part of the Erlang ecosystem, and as such it uses the
<a href="https://hex.pm">Hex package manager</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>gleam hex revert</code> has been added to the Gleam binary. It can be used to
unpublish a package release within the first 24 hours of it being published.
After 24 hours Hex package releases become immutable and cannot be removed.</p>

<p>Additionally the error message that is emitted when you attempt to publish a
package that has already been published has been improved:</p>
<pre><code>error: Version already published

Version v1.0.0 has already been published.
This release has been recently published so you can replace it
or you can publish it using a different version number

Hint: Please add the --replace flag if you want to replace the release.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/Pi-Cla">Pi-Cla</a> for these features!</p>

<h2 id="erlang-module-collision-prevention">Erlang module collision prevention</h2>

<p>The Erlang virtual machine supports loading new versions of existing module,
enabling an application to be upgraded while it is still running. One
unfortunate consequence of this is that if you accidentally reuse a module name
loading it into the VM will cause the application to be upgraded to the new
version, causing confusing errors as functions that no longer exist are called
and crash.</p>

<p>The Gleam build tool would return an error and refuse to compile Gleam modules
that would overwrite each other, but with this version it will also emit an
error if a Gleam module would overwrite a built-in Erlang/OTP module.</p>
<pre><code>error: Erlang module name collision

The module `src/code.gleam` compiles to an Erlang module named `code`.

By default Erlang includes a module with the same name so if we were to
compile and load your module it would overwrite the Erlang one, potentially
causing confusing errors and crashes.

Hint: Rename this module and try again.
</code></pre>



<p>A helpful error message is now shown if the <code>manifest.toml</code> file has become
invalid, perhaps due to a git rebase or accidental edit.</p>
<pre><code>error: Corrupt manifest.toml

The `manifest.toml` file is corrupt.

Hint: Please run `gleam update` to fix it.
</code></pre>

<p>Previously when no package versions could be found that satisfy the project’s
requirements a very cryptic message would printed that detailed all the
constraints from all the versions that were incompatible. This was overwhelming
and practically impossible to read, so it has been replaced with a much simpler
message.</p>
<pre><code>error: Dependency resolution failed

An error occurred while determining what dependency packages and
versions should be downloaded.
The error from the version resolver library was:

Unable to find compatible versions for the version constraints in your
gleam.toml. The conflicting packages are:

- hellogleam
- lustre_dev_tools
- glint
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/zahash">zahash</a> for these improvements!</p>

<h2 id="redundant-pattern-matching-warnings">Redundant pattern matching warnings</h2>

<p>Gleam’s case expressons support pattern matching on multiple values at the same
time. This is uncommon so people used to other languages may habitually wrap
multiple values in a tuple or a list to match on them. The compiler will now
warn when this is done:</p>
<pre><code>warning: Redundant list
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:2:14
  │
2 │         case [1, 2] {
  │              ^^^^^^ You can remove this list wrapper

Instead of building a list and matching on it, you can match on its
contents directly.
A case expression can take multiple subjects separated by commas like this:

    case one_subject, another_subject {
      _, _ -&gt; todo
    }

See: https://tour.gleam.run/flow-control/multiple-subjects/
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature.</p>

<h2 id="redundant-pattern-matching-auto-fix">Redundant pattern matching auto-fix</h2>

<p>And further still, if you are using the Gleam language server then a code action
is offered to automatically fix redundant tuple wrappers. Place your cursor on
the tuple and select this language action and the language server will remove
the tuple from the values as well as from all patterns in the case expression.</p>
<pre><code>case #(x, y) {
  #(1, 2) -&gt; 0
  #(_, _) -&gt; 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Is rewritten to:</p>
<pre><code>case x, y {
  1, 2 -&gt; 0
  _, _ -&gt; 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/nicklimmm">Nicky Lim</a> for this code action, and
for laying the foundation for other code actions like this in future!</p>

<h2 id="a-helping-hand-for-javascript-programmers">A helping hand for JavaScript programmers</h2>

<p>JavaScript programmers sometimes type <code>===</code> by mistake in their Gleam code. We
have an error message for that too now:</p>
<pre><code>error: Syntax error
  ┌─ /src/parse/error.gleam:4:37
  │
4 │   [1,2,3] |&gt; list.filter(fn (a) { a === 3 })
  │                                     ^^^ Did you mean `==`?

Gleam uses `==` to check for equality between two values.
See: https://tour.gleam.run/basics/equality
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/rabingaire">Rabin Gaire</a> for this feature!</p>
