    <h1>Show HN: I Wrote a Book on Java</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming-in-java" rel="nofollow">https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming-in-j...</a></p><p>This book is a distillation of everything I’ve learned about what effective development looks like in Java (so far!). It&#39;s about how to organize programs around data &#34;as plain data&#34; and the surprisingly benefits that emerge when we do. Programs that are built around the data they manage tend to be simpler, smaller, and significantly easier understand.</p><p>Java has changed radically over the last several years. It has picked up all kinds of new language features which support data oriented programming (records, pattern matching, `with` expressions, sum and product types). However, this is not a book about tools. No amount of studying a screw-driver will teach you how to build a house. This book focuses on house building. We&#39;ll pick out a plot of land, lay a foundation, and build upon it house that can weather any storm.</p><p>DoP is based around a very simple idea, and one people have been rediscovering since the dawn of computing, &#34;representation is the essence of programming.&#34; When we do a really good job of capturing the data in our domain, the rest of the system tends to fall into place in a way which can feel like it’s writing itself.</p><p>That&#39;s my elevator pitch! The book is currently in early access. I hope you check it out. I&#39;d love to hear your feedback.</p><p>You can get 50% off (thru October 9th) with code `mlkiehl`
