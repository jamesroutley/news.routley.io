    <h2>a studio for the summer</h2>
    
    <p>this summer,  I will be renting a space in a studio.</p>
    
    <p>I have many ideas in mind, including a few new projects based on performance art.</p>
    
    <h2>to learn, to (self) develop</h2>
    
    <p>I am nurturing my personal imaginary landscape through readings, like the project <a href="http://archiverlepresent.org/">archiver le présent</a> and the book <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/958-artificial-hells">artificial hells</a>.</p>

    <p>I am nurturing my practice through workshops, like <a href="https://fonderiedarling.org/en/Atelier-!Mediengruppe-Bitnik">this one by Mediagruppe bitnik with the Fonderie Darling and Eastern Bloc</a> and this other one <a href="https://raiq.ca/activites/approches-rituelles-et-performatives-en-art-interdisciplinaire-stephane-crete-et-sylvie-tourangeau/">on rituals in interdisciplinary arts</a>.</p>
    
    <p>it&#39;s moving furniture in my head, it&#39;s opening windows - it&#39;s changing places.</p>
    
    <h2>towards a third version for <i>finartcialist</i></h2>
    
    <p>I want to leave the financial world for a while, and maybe come back to it later.</p>
    
    <p>I want to dive into something else, I want to explore other shoes...</p>
    
    <p>but I don&#39;t want to completely leave this practice, just maybe re-think it a little bit.</p>
    
    <p>as a way to move on with my practice, I&#39;ve started the <a href="https://www.finartcialist.com/v3/index.html">third version</a> of <i>finartcialist</i>. it&#39;s a transit version.</p>
    
    <p>maybe this will be the last ticket for the second version of finartcialist? I wanted to let you know that there was going to be a follow up.</p>
  
    <h2 id="escarcelle"><a href="#escarcelle">escarcelle, le marché aux sentiments - beta version</a></h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.finartcialist.com/escarcelle/beta">beta version of escarcelle, the feelings market</a> is still ongoing.</p>
    <p>The goal of this first public step of the project is to create a marketplace for bartering postcards. No other object will be accepted for now.</p>
    
    <p>For more information, please read the <a href="https://finartcialist.com/escarcelle/en/blog/index.html">blog of the project</a>!</p>
