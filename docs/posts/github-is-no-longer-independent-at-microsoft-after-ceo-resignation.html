After nearly four years as CEO, Dohmke is leaving GitHub to “become a startup founder again,” and pursue opportunities outside of Microsoft and GitHub.</p><p>GitHub has operated as a separate company ever <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/17954714/microsoft-github-deal-acquisition-complete">since Microsoft acquired it</a> in 2018 for $7.5 billion, but Dohmke’s departure is part of a big shakeup to the way GitHub operates. Microsoft isn’t replacing Dohmke’s CEO position, and GitHub will now be fully part of Microsoft instead of being run as a separate entity.</p><p>“GitHub and its leadership team will continue its mission as part of Microsoft’s CoreAI organization, with more details shared soon,” says Dohmke in <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/goodbye-github/">a memo</a> to GitHub employees today. “I’ll be staying through the end of 2025 to help guide the transition and am leaving with a deep sense of pride in everything we’ve built as a remote-first organization spread around the world.”</p><p>Microsoft’s CoreAI team is a new engineering group led by former Meta executive Jay Parikh. It includes Microsoft’s platform and tools division and Dev Div teams, with a focus on building an AI platform and tools for both Microsoft and its customers. Parikh described his vision of an AI agent factory <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/672598/microsoft-ai-agent-factory-jay-parikh-interview">in an interview with </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/672598/microsoft-ai-agent-factory-jay-parikh-interview">Notepad</a> </em>earlier this year, and how he is convincing the developer division of Microsoft to adopt AI.</p><p>“Just like how Bill [Gates] had this idea of Microsoft being a bunch of software developers building a bunch of software, I want our platform, for any enterprise or any organization, to be able to be the thing they turn into their own agent factory,” said Parikh.</p><p>Dohmke only just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/720075/github-ceo-thomas-dohmke-ai-coding-copilot-openai-interview">appeared on <em>Decoder </em>last week</a>, discussing Copilot, vibe coding, and what’s next for AI. Dohmke was thinking a lot about the competition and GitHub’s role in the future of software development, and now he’s about to leave to potentially create some more competition for Microsoft’s AI efforts.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div>
