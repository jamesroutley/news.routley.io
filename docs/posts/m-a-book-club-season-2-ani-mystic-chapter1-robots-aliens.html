<p>This year Aya and I are reading Ani*mystic by Gordon White from <a href="http://Share 1 reason why 1 of your core beliefs is true -   Share 1 thing you believe that everyone else doesn’t – and why you’re correct -   Share 1 (uncommon) observation you have about the world – and why others are missing it -   Share 1 razor (decision-making framework) you use in your day-to-day life">Rune Soup</a>. I have read all of Gordon’s books, and I am excited to dive in. This week is a meditation on Chapter 1.</p>



<p>For years I taught a class called <strong>Computers, Robots, and Film</strong> at Fordham University.  It was an incredible class. Often we discuss the relationship between aliens and robots – even though aliens were not on the curriculum.  Gordon’s chapter sort of goes from robots to aliens which is why I bring this up. But I am starting in medias res.  Let me instead start with what is alive in me. </p>



<p>“We make the ocean when we fish in it”  This sort of encapsulates the feeling of this chapter and perhaps this book. What is the world? I read a book a few years ago by Markus Gabriel – a brilliant philosopher – and the book was called ‘why the world does not exist.’  I mean obviously the world exists.  But we live in a time where someone can make the claim that the world does not exist, and this is partially Gordon’s issue – I mean this should be everyone’s issue because doubting something as fundamental as the world is totally nihilistic (even if it is a joke).  This is not only an animist notion it is a nonduality notion – as a nonduality practitioner – this is how I identify with animism. </p>



<p>Gordon talks about another favorite author of mine, Charles Eisenstein, and the story of separation. </p>



<p>What is the story of separation – It is when we no longer make the ocean when we fish it. It is when the ocean exists apart from us. </p>



<p>As a once and future roboticist it is hard for me to see the “metaphor of machines” as the root of the story of separation- although this may true. Machines are other – they divide the world into natural and artificial – where as there is nothing nature and nothing artificial. A foreign seed becomes a local seed and a local seed migrates to become a foreign seed. </p>



<p>Make we should move to the metaphor of aliens now – and we are all aliens and all native.  I am the other and I am the self. </p>
