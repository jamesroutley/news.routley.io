<p><em>On December 28th, I delivered a speech entitled &#34;<a href="https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2025/fahrplan/event/a-post-american-enshittification-resistant-internet">A post-American, enshittification-resistant internet</a>&#34; for 39C3, the 39th Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg, Germany. This is the transcript of that speech.</em></p>
<hr/>

<p>Many of you know that I&#39;m an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation – EFF. I&#39;m about to start my 25th year there. I know that I&#39;m hardly unbiased, but as far as I&#39;m concerned, there&#39;s no group anywhere on Earth that does the work of defending our digital rights better than EFF.</p>
<p>I&#39;m an activist there, and for the past quarter-century, I&#39;ve been embroiled in something I call &#34;The War on General Purpose Computing.&#34;</p>
<p>If you were at 28C3, 14 years ago, you may have heard me give a talk with that title. Those are the trenches I&#39;ve been in since my very first day on the job at EFF, when I flew to Los Angeles to crash the inaugural meeting of something called the &#34;Broadcast Protection Discussion Group,&#34; an unholy alliance of tech companies, media companies, broadcasters and cable operators.</p>
<p>They&#39;d gathered because this lavishly corrupt American congressman, Billy Tauzin, had promised them a new regulation – a rule banning the manufacture and sale of digital computers, unless they had been backdoored to specifications set by that group, specifications for technical measures to block computers from performing operations that were dispreferred by these companies&#39; shareholders.</p>
<p>That rule was called &#34;the Broadcast Flag,&#34; and it actually passed through the American telecoms regulator, the Federal Communications Commission. So we sued the FCC in federal court, and overturned the rule.</p>
<p>We won that skirmish, but friends, I have bad news, news that will not surprise you. Despite wins like that one, we have been losing the war on the general purpose computer for the past 25 years.</p>
<p>Which is why I&#39;ve come to Hamburg today. Because, after decades of throwing myself against a locked door, the door that leads to a new, good internet, one that delivers both the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 that let our normie friends join the party, that door has been unlocked.</p>
<p>Today, it is open a crack. It&#39;s open a crack!</p>
<p>And here&#39;s the weirdest part: Donald Trump is the guy who&#39;s unlocked that door.</p>
<p>Oh, he didn&#39;t do it on purpose! But, thanks to Trump&#39;s incontinent belligerence, we are on the cusp of a &#34;Post-American Internet,&#34; a new digital nervous system for the 21st century. An internet that we can build without worrying about America&#39;s demands and priorities.</p>
<p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not <em>happy</em> about Trump or his policies. But as my friend Joey DaVilla likes to say &#34;When life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla.&#34; The only thing worse than experiencing all the terror that Trump has unleashed on America and the world would be going through all that and not salvaging anything out of the wreckage.</p>
<p>That&#39;s what I want to talk to you about today: the post-American Internet we can wrest from Trump&#39;s chaos.</p>
<p>A post-American Internet that is possible because Trump has mobilized new coalition partners to join the fight on our side. In politics, coalitions are <em>everything</em>. Any time you see a group of people suddenly succeeding at a goal they have been failing to achieve, it&#39;s a sure bet that they&#39;ve found some coalition partners, new allies who don&#39;t want <em>all</em> the same thing as the original forces, but want <em>enough</em> of the same things to fight on their side.</p>
<p>That&#39;s where Trump came from: a coalition of billionaires, white nationalists, Christian bigots, authoritarians, conspiratorialists, imperialists, and self-described &#34;libertarians&#34; who&#39;ve got such a scorching case of low-tax brain worms that they&#39;d vote for Mussolini if he&#39;d promise to lower their taxes by a nickel.</p>
<p>And what&#39;s got me so excited is that <em>we&#39;ve</em> got a new coalition in the War on General Purpose Computers: a coalition that includes the digital rights activists who&#39;ve been on the lines for decades, but <em>also</em> people who want to turn America&#39;s Big Tech trillions into billions for their own economy, <em>and</em> national security hawks who are quite rightly worried about digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>My thesis here is that this is an <em>unstoppable</em> coalition. Which is good news! For the first time in decades, victory is in our grasp.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>So let me explain: 14 years ago, I stood in front of this group and explained the &#34;War on General Purpose Computing.&#34; That was my snappy name for this fight, but the boring name that they use in legislatures for it is &#34;anticircumvention,&#34;</p>
<p>Under anticircumvention law, it&#39;s a crime to alter the functioning of a digital product or service, unless the manufacturer approves of your modification, and – crucially – this is true <em>whether or not</em> your modification violates <em>any other law</em>.</p>
<p>Anticircumvention law originates in the USA: Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 establishes a felony punishable by a five year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine for a first offense for bypassing an &#34;access control&#34; for a copyrighted work.</p>
<p>So practically speaking, if you design a device or service with even the flimsiest of systems to prevent modification of its application code or firmware, it&#39;s a felony – a jailable felony – to modify that code or firmware. It&#39;s also a felony to disclose information about <em>how</em> to bypass that access control, which means that pen-testers who even <em>describe</em> how they access a device or system face criminal liability.</p>
<p>Under anticircumvention law any manufacturer can trivially turn their product into a no-go zone, criminalizing the act of investigating its defects, criminalizing the act of reporting on its defects, and criminalizing the act of remediating its defects.</p>
<p>This is a law that Jay Freeman rightly calls &#34;Felony Contempt of Business Model.&#34; Anticircumvention became the law of the land in 1998 when Bill Clinton signed the DMCA. But before you start snickering at those stupid Americans, know this: every <em>other</em> country in the world has passed a law <em>just like this</em> in the years since. Here in the EU, it came in through Article 6 of the 2001 EU Copyright Directive.</p>
<p>Now, it makes a certain twisted sense for the US to enact a law like this, after all, they are the world&#39;s tech powerhouse, home to the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world. By making it illegal to modify digital products without the manufacturer&#39;s permission, America enhances the rent-extracting power of the most valuable companies on US stock exchanges.</p>
<p>But why would <em>Europe</em> pass a law like this? Europe is a massive tech <em>importer</em>. By extending legal protection to tech companies that want to steal their users&#39; data and money, the EU was facilitating a one-way transfer of value from Europe to America. So why would Europe do this?</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you about the circumstances under which <em>other</em> countries came to enact their anticircumvention laws and maybe you&#39;ll spot a pattern that will answer this question.</p>
<p>Australia got its anticircumvention law through the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Australia to enact anticircumvention law.</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico got it through the US-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Canada and Mexico to enact anticircumvention laws.</p>
<p>Andean nations like Chile got their anticircumvention laws through bilateral US free trade agreements, which oblige them to enact anticircumvention laws.</p>
<p>And the Central American nations got their anticircumvention laws through CAFTA – The Central American Free Trade Agreement with the USA – which obliges them to enact anticircumvention laws, too.</p>
<p>I assume you&#39;ve spotted the pattern by now: the US trade representative has forced every one of its trading partners to adopt anticircumvention law, to facilitate the extraction of their own people&#39;s data and money by American firms. But of course, that only raises a further question: Why would every other country in the world agree to let America steal its own people&#39;s money and data, and block its domestic tech sector from making interoperable products that would prevent this theft?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an anecdote that unravels this riddle: many years ago, in the years before Viktor Orban rose to power, I used to guest-lecture at a summer PhD program in political science at Budapest&#39;s Central European University. And one summer, after I&#39;d lectured to my students about anticircumvention law, one of them approached me.</p>
<p>They had been the information minister of a Central American nation during the CAFTA negotiations, and one day, they&#39;d received a phone-call from their trade negotiator, calling from the CAFTA bargaining table. The negotiator said, &#34;You know how you told me not to give the Americans anticircumvention under any circumstances? Well, they&#39;re saying that they won&#39;t take our coffee unless we give them anticircumvention. And I&#39;m sorry, but we just can&#39;t lose the US coffee market. Our economy would collapse. So we&#39;re going to give them anticircumvention. I&#39;m really sorry.&#34;</p>
<p>That&#39;s it. That&#39;s why every government in the world allowed US Big Tech companies to declare open season on their people&#39;s private data and ready cash.</p>
<p>The alternative was tariffs. Well, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard, but we&#39;ve got tariffs now!</p>
<p>I mean, if someone threatens to burn your house down unless you follow their orders, and then they burn your house down anyway, you don&#39;t have to keep following their orders. So…Happy Liberation Day?</p>
<p>So far, every country in the world has had one of two responses to the Trump tariffs. The first one is: &#34;Give Trump everything he asks for (except Greenland) and hope he stops being mad at you.&#34; This has been an absolute failure. Give Trump an inch, he&#39;ll take a mile. He&#39;ll take fucking <em>Greenland</em>. Capitulation is a failure.</p>
<p>But so is the other tactic: retaliatory tariffs. That&#39;s what we&#39;ve done in Canada (like all the best Americans, I&#39;m Canadian). Our top move has been to levy tariffs on the stuff we import from America, making the things we buy <em>more</em> expensive. That&#39;s a weird way to punish America! It&#39;s like punching yourself in the face as hard as you can, and hoping the downstairs neighbor says &#34;Ouch!&#34;</p>
<p>And it&#39;s <em>indiscriminate</em>. Why whack some poor farmer from a state that begins and ends with a vowel with tariffs on his soybeans. That guy never did anything bad to Canada.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s a third possible response to tariffs, one that&#39;s just sitting there, begging to be tried: what about repealing anticircumvention law?</p>
<p>If you&#39;re a technologist or an investor based in a country that&#39;s repealed its anticircumvention law, you can go into business making disenshittificatory products that plug into America&#39;s defective tech exports, allowing the people who own and use those products to use them in ways that are good for them, even if those uses make the company&#39;s shareholders mad.</p>
<p>Think of John Deere tractors: when a farmer&#39;s John Deere tractor breaks down, they are expected to repair it, swapping in new parts and assemblies to replace whatever&#39;s malfing. But the tractor won&#39;t recognize that new part and will not start working again, not until the farmer spends a couple hundred bucks on a service callout from an official John Deere tractor repair rep, whose only job is to type an unlock code into the tractor&#39;s console, to initialize the part and pair it with the tractor&#39;s main computing unit.</p>
<p>Modding a tractor to bypass this activation step violates anticircumvention law, meaning farmers all over the world are stuck with this ripoff garbage, because their <em>own</em> government will lock up anyone who makes a tractor mod that disables the parts-pairing check in this American product.</p>
<p>So what if Canada repealed Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act of 2012 (that&#39;s our anticircumvention law)? Well, then a company like Honeybee, which makes tractor front-ends and attachments, could hire some smart University of Waterloo computer science grads, and put &#39;em to work jailbreaking the John Deere tractor&#39;s firmware, and offer it to everyone in the world. They could sell the crack to anyone with an internet connection and a payment method, including that poor American farmer whose soybeans we&#39;re currently tariffing.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to convey how much money is on the table here. Take just <em>one</em> example: Apple&#39;s App Store. Apple forces all app vendors into using its payment processor, and charges them a <em>30 percent</em> commission on every euro spent inside of an app.</p>
<p>30 percent! That&#39;s <em>such</em> a profitable business that Apple makes <em>$100 billion per year</em> on it. If the EU repeals Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, some smart geeks in Finland could reverse-engineer Apple&#39;s bootloaders and make a hardware dongle that jailbreaks phones so that they can use alternative app stores, and sell the dongle – along with the infrastructure to operate an app store – to anyone in the world who wants to go into business competing with Apple for users and app vendors.</p>
<p>Those competitors could offer a 90% discount to every crafter on Etsy, every performer on Patreon, every online news outlet, every game dev, every media store. Offer them a 90% discount on payments, and <em>still</em> make $10b/year.</p>
<p>Maybe Finland will never see another Nokia, but Nokia&#39;s a tough business to be in. You&#39;ve got to make hardware, which is expensive and risky. But if the EU legalizes jailbreaking, then <em>Apple</em> would have to incur all the expense and risk of making and fielding hardware, while those Finnish geeks could cream off the $100b Apple sucks out of the global economy in an act of a disgusting, rip-off rent-seeking.</p>
<p>As Jeff Bezos said to the publishers: &#34;Your margin is my opportunity.&#34; With these guys, it&#39;s always &#34;disruption for thee, but not for me.&#34; When they do it to us, that&#39;s progress. When we do it to them, it&#39;s piracy, and every pirate wants to be an admiral.</p>
<p>Well, screw that. Move fast and break Tim Cook&#39;s things. Move fast and break <em>kings</em>!</p>
<p>It&#39;s funny: I spent 25 years getting my ass kicked by the US Trade Representative (in my defense, it wasn&#39;t a fair fight). I developed a kind of grudging admiration for the skill with which the USTR bound the entire world to a system of trade that conferred parochial advantages to America and its tech firms, giving them free rein to loot the world&#39;s data and economies. So it&#39;s been pretty amazing to watch Trump swiftly and decisively dismantle the global system of trade and destroy the case for the world continuing to arrange its affairs to protect the interests of America&#39;s capital class.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#39;s not a path I would have chosen. I&#39;d have preferred no Trump at all to this breakthrough. But I&#39;ll take this massive own-goal if Trump insists. I mean, I&#39;m not saying I&#39;ve become an accelerationist, but at this point, I&#39;m not exactly <em>not</em> an accelerationist.</p>
<p>Now, you might have heard that governments around the world have been trying to get Apple to open its App Store, and they&#39;ve totally failed at this. When the EU hit Apple with an enforcement order under the Digital Markets Act, Apple responded by offering to allow third party app stores, but it would only allow those stores to sell apps that Apple had approved of.</p>
<p>And while those stores <em>could</em> use their own payment processors, Apple would charge them so much in junk fees that it would be <em>more</em> expensive to process a payment using your own system, and if Apple believed that a user&#39;s phone had been outside of the EU for 21 days, they&#39;d remotely delete all that user&#39;s data and apps.</p>
<p>When the EU explained that this would not satisfy the regulation, Apple threatened to pull out of the EU. Then, once everyone had finished laughing, Apple filed more than a dozen bullshit objections to the order hoping to tie this up in court for a decade, the way Google and Meta did for the GDPR.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not clear that the EU can force Apple to write code that opens up the iOS platform for alternative app stores and payment methods, but there is one thing that the EU can absolutely do with 100% reliability, any time they want: the EU can decide not to let Apple use Europe&#39;s courts to shut down European companies that defend European merchants, performers, makers, news outlets, game devs and creative workers, from Apple&#39;s ripoff, by jailbreaking phones.</p>
<p>All the EU has to do is repeal Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, and, in so doing, strip Apple of the privilege of mobilizing the European justice system to shore up Apple&#39;s hundred billion dollar annual tax on the world&#39;s digital economy. The EU company that figures out how to reliably jailbreak iPhones will have customers all over the world, including in the USA, where Apple doesn&#39;t just use its veto over which apps you can run on your phone to suck 30% out of every dollar you spend, but where Apple also uses its control over the platform to strip out apps that protect Apple&#39;s customers from Trump&#39;s fascist takeover.</p>
<p>Back in October, Apple kicked the &#34;ICE Block&#34; app out of the App Store. That&#39;s an app that warns the user if there&#39;s a snatch squad of masked ICE thugs nearby looking to grab you off the street and send you to an offshore gulag. Apple internally classified ICE kidnappers as a &#34;protected class,&#34; and then declared the ICE Block infringed on the rights of these poor, beset ICE goons.</p>
<p>And speaking of ICE thugs, there are plenty of qualified technologists who have fled the US this year, one step ahead of an ICE platoon looking to put them and their children into a camp. Those skilled hackers are now living all over the world, joined by investors who&#39;d like to back a business whose success will be determined by how awesome its products are, and not how many $TRUMP coins they buy.</p>
<p>Apple&#39;s margin could be <em>their</em> opportunity.</p>
<p>Legalizing jailbreaking, raiding the highest margin lines of business of the most profitable companies in America is a <em>much</em> better response to the Trump tariffs than retaliatory tariffs.</p>
<p>For one thing, this is a <em>targeted</em> response: go after Big Tech&#39;s margins and you&#39;re mounting a frontal assault on the businesses whose CEOs each paid a million bucks to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais.</p>
<p>Raiding Big Tech&#39;s margins is not an attack on the American people, nor on the small American businesses that are ripped off by Big Tech. It&#39;s a raid on the companies that screw everyday Americans <em>and</em> everyone else in the world. It&#39;s a way to make everyone in the world richer at the expense of these ripoff companies.</p>
<p>It beats the shit out of blowing hundreds of billions of dollars building AI data-centers in the hopes that someday, a sector that&#39;s lost nearly a trillion dollars shipping defective chatbots will figure out a use for GPUs that doesn&#39;t start hemorrhaging money the minute they plug them in.</p>
<p>So here are our new allies in the war on general-purpose computation: businesses and technologists who want to make billions of dollars raiding Big Tech&#39;s margins, and policymakers who want their country to be the disenshittification nation – the country that doesn&#39;t merely protect its people&#39;s money and privacy by buying jailbreaks from other countries, but rather, the country that makes billions of dollars <em>selling</em> that privacy and pocketbook-defending tech to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a powerful alliance, but those are not the only allies Trump has pushed into our camp. There&#39;s another powerful ally waiting in the wings.</p>
<p>Remember last June, when the International Criminal Court in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for the génocidaire Benjamin Netanyahu, and Trump denounced the ICC, and then the ICC lost its Outlook access, its email archives, its working files, its address books, its calendars?</p>
<p>Microsoft says they didn&#39;t brick the ICC – that it&#39;s a coincidence. But when it comes to a he-said/Clippy-said between the justices of the ICC and the convicted monopolists of Microsoft, I know who <em>I</em> believe.</p>
<p>This is exactly the kind of infrastructural risk that we were warned of if we let Chinese companies like Huawei supply our critical telecoms equipment. Virtually every government ministry, every major corporation, every small business and every household in the world have locked themselves into a US-based, cloud-based service.</p>
<p>The handful of US Big Tech companies that supply the world&#39;s administrative tools are all vulnerable to pressure from the Trump admin, and that means that Trump can brick an entire <em>nation</em>.</p>
<p>The attack on the ICC was an act of cyberwarfare, like the Russian hackers who shut down Ukrainian power-generation facilities, except that Microsoft doesn&#39;t have to <em>hack</em> Outlook to brick the ICC – they <em>own</em> Outlook.</p>
<p>Under the US CLOUD Act of 2018, the US government can compel any US-based company to disclose <em>any</em> of its users&#39; data – including foreign governments – and this is true no matter where that data is stored. Last July, Anton Carniaux, Director of Public and Legal Affairs at Microsoft France, told a French government inquiry that he &#34;couldn&#39;t guarantee&#34; that Microsoft wouldn&#39;t hand sensitive French data over to the US government, even if that data was stored in a European data-center.</p>
<p>And under the CLOUD Act, the US government can slap gag orders on the companies that it forces to cough up that data, so there&#39;d be no way to even know if this happened, or whether it&#39;s already happened.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t stop at administrative tools, either: remember back in 2022, when Putin&#39;s thugs looted millions of dollars&#39; worth of John Deere tractors from Ukraine and those tractors showed up in Chechnya? The John Deere company pushed an over-the-air kill signal to those tractors and bricked &#39;em.</p>
<p>John Deere is every bit as politically vulnerable to the Trump admin as Microsoft is, and they can brick most of the tractors in the world, and the tractors they <em>can&#39;t</em> brick are probably made by Massey Ferguson, the number-two company in the ag-tech cartel, which is also an American company and just as vulnerable to political attacks from the US government.</p>
<p>Now, none of this will be news to global leaders. Even before Trump and Microsoft bricked the ICC they were trying to figure out a path to &#34;digital sovereignty.&#34; But the Trump administration&#39;s outrageous conduct and rhetoric over past 11 months has turned &#34;digital sovereignty&#34; from a nice-to-have into a must-have.</p>
<p>So finally, we&#39;re seeing some movement, like &#34;Eurostack,&#34; a project to clone the functionality of US Big Tech silos in free/open source software, and to build EU-based data-centers that this code can run on.</p>
<p>But Eurostack is heading for a crisis. It&#39;s great to build open, locally hosted, auditable, trustworthy services that replicate the useful features of Big Tech, but you also need to build the adversarial interoperability tools that allow for mass exporting of millions of documents, the sensitive data-structures and edit histories.</p>
<p>We need scrapers and headless browsers to accomplish the adversarial interoperability that will guarantee ongoing connectivity to institutions that are still hosted on US cloud-based services, because US companies are <em>not</em> going to facilitate the mass exodus of international customers from their platform.</p>
<p>Just think of how Apple responded to the relatively minor demand to open up the iOS App Store, and now imagine the thermonuclear foot-dragging, tantrum-throwing and malicious compliance they&#39;ll come up with when faced with the departure of a plurality of the businesses and governments in a 27-nation bloc of 500,000,000 affluent consumers.</p>
<p>Any serious attempt at digital sovereignty needs migration tools that work <em>without</em> the cooperation of the Big Tech companies. Otherwise, this is like building housing for East Germans and locating it in <em>West</em> Berlin. It doesn&#39;t matter how great the housing is, your intended audience is going to really struggle to move in unless you tear down the wall.</p>
<p>Step one of tearing down that wall is killing anticircumvention law, so that we can run virtual devices that can be scripted, break bootloaders to swap out firmware and generally seize the means of computation.</p>
<p>So this is the third bloc in the disenshittification army: not just digital rights hippies like me; not just entrepreneurs and economic development wonks rubbing their hands together at the thought of transforming American trillions into European billions; but also the national security hawks who are 100% justified in their extreme concern about their country&#39;s reliance on American platforms that have been shown to be <em>totally</em> unreliable.</p>
<p>This is how we&#39;ll get a post-American internet: with an unstoppable coalition of activists, entrepreneurs and natsec hawks.</p>
<p>This has been a long time coming. Since the post-war settlement, the world has treated the US as a neutral platform, a trustworthy and stable maintainer of critical systems for global interchange, what the political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman call the &#34;Underground Empire.&#34; But over the past 15 years, the US has systematically shattered global trust in its institutions, a process that only accelerated under Trump.</p>
<p>Take transoceanic fiber optic cables: the way the transoceanic fiber routes were planned, the majority of these cables make landfall on the coasts of the USA where the interconnections are handled. There&#39;s a good case for this hub-and-spoke network topology, especially compared to establishing direct links between every country. That&#39;s an Order(N^2) problem: directly linking each of the planet Earth&#39;s 205 countries to every other country would require 20,910 fiber links.</p>
<p>But putting all the world&#39;s telecoms eggs in America&#39;s basket only works if the US doesn&#39;t take advantage of its centrality, and while many people worried about what the US could do with the head-ends of the world&#39;s global fiber infra, it wasn&#39;t until Mark Klein&#39;s 2006 revelations about the NSA&#39;s nation-scale fiber optic taps in AT&amp;T&#39;s network, and Ed Snowden&#39;s 2013 documents showing the global scale of this wiretapping, that the world had to confront the undeniable reality that the US could not be trusted to serve as the world&#39;s fiber hub.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not just fiber. The world does business in dollars. Most countries maintain dollar accounts at the Fed in New York as their major source of foreign reserves. But in 2005, American vulture capitalists bought up billions of dollars worth of Argentinian government bonds after the sovereign nation of Argentina had declared bankruptcy.</p>
<p>They convinced a judge in New York to turn over the government of Argentina&#39;s US assets to them to make good on loans that these debt collectors had not issued, but had bought up at pennies on the dollar. At that moment, every government in the world had to confront the reality that they could not trust the US Federal Reserve with their foreign reserves. But what else could they use?</p>
<p>Without a clear answer, dollar dominance continued, but then, under Biden, Putin-aligned oligarchs and Russian firms lost access to the SWIFT system for dollar clearing. This is when goods – like oil – are priced in dollars, so that buyers only need to find someone who will trade their own currency for dollars, which they can then swap for any commodity in the world.</p>
<p>Again, there&#39;s a sound case for dollar clearing: it&#39;s just not practical to establish deep, liquid pairwise trading market for all of the world&#39;s nearly 200 currencies, it&#39;s another O(N^2) problem.</p>
<p>But it only works if the dollar is a neutral platform. Once the dollar becomes an instrument of US foreign policy – whether or not you agree with that policy – it&#39;s no longer a neutral platform, and the world goes looking for an alternative.</p>
<p>No one knows what that alternative&#39;s going to be, just as no one knows what configuration the world&#39;s fiber links will end up taking. There&#39;s kilometers of fiber being stretched across the ocean floor, and countries are trying out some pretty improbable gambits as dollar alternatives, like Ethiopia revaluing its sovereign debt in Chinese renminbi. Without a clear alternative to America&#39;s enshittified platforms, the post-American century is off to a rocky start.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s one post-American system that&#39;s easy to imagine. The project to rip out all the cloud connected, backdoored, untrustworthy black boxes that power our institutions, our medical implants, our vehicles and our tractors; and replace it with collectively maintained, open, free, trustworthy, auditable code.</p>
<p>This project is the <em>only</em> one that benefits from economies of scale, rather than being paralyzed by exponential crises of scale. That&#39;s because any open, free tool adopted by any public institution – like the Eurostack services – can be audited, localized, pen-tested, debugged and improved by institutions in every other country.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a commons, more like a science than a technology, in that it is universal and international and collaborative. We don&#39;t have dueling western and Chinese principles of structural engineering. Rather, we have universal principles for making sure buildings don&#39;t fall down, adapted to local circumstances.</p>
<p>We wouldn&#39;t tolerate secrecy in the calculations used to keep our buildings upright, and we shouldn&#39;t tolerate opacity in the software that keeps our tractors, hearing aids, ventilators, pacemakers, trains, games consoles, phones, CCTVs, door locks, and government ministries working.</p>
<p>The thing is, software is not an asset, it&#39;s a liability. The capabilities that running software delivers – automation, production, analysis and administration – <em>those</em> are assets. But the software itself? That&#39;s a liability. Brittle, fragile, forever breaking down as the software upstream of it, downstream of it, and adjacent to it is updated or swapped out, revealing defects and deficiencies in systems that may have performed well for years.</p>
<p>Shifting software to commons-based production is a way to reduce the liability that software imposes on its makers and users,  balancing out that liability among many players.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, tech bosses are totally clueless when it comes to this. They really do think that software is an asset. That&#39;s why they&#39;re so fucking horny to have chatbots shit out software at superhuman speeds. That&#39;s why they think it&#39;s <em>good</em> that they&#39;ve got a chatbot that &#34;produces a thousand times more code than a human programmer.&#34;</p>
<p>Producing code that isn&#39;t designed for legibility and maintainability, that is optimized, rather, for speed of production, is a way to incur tech debt at scale.</p>
<p>This is a neat encapsulation of the whole AI story: the chatbot can&#39;t do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with a chatbot that <em>can&#39;t</em> do your job.</p>
<p>Your boss is an easy mark for that chatbot hustler because your boss hates you. In their secret hearts, bosses understand that if they stopped coming to work, the business would run along just fine, but if the <em>workers</em> stopped showing up, the company would grind to a halt.</p>
<p>Bosses like to tell themselves that they&#39;re in the driver&#39;s seat, but really, they fear that they&#39;re strapped into the back seat playing with a Fisher Price steering wheel. For them, AI is a way to wire the toy steering wheel directly into the company&#39;s drive-train. It&#39;s the realization of the fantasy of a company without workers.</p>
<p>When I was walking the picket line in Hollywood during the writer&#39;s strike, a writer told me that you prompt an AI the same way a studio boss gives shitty notes to a writer&#39;s room: &#34;Make me ET, but make it about a dog, and give it a love interest, and a car-chase in the third act.&#34;</p>
<p>Say that to a writer&#39;s room and they will call you a <em>fucking idiot suit</em> and tell you &#34;Why don&#39;t you go back to your office and make a spreadsheet, you nitwit. The grownups here are writing a movie.&#34;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you give that prompt to a chatbot, it will cheerfully shit out a script exactly to spec. The fact that this script will be terrible and unusable is less important than the prospect of a working life in which no one calls you a fucking idiot suit.</p>
<p>AI dangles the promise of a writer&#39;s room without writers, a movie without actors, a hospital without nurses, a coding shop without coders.</p>
<p>When Mark Zuckerberg went on a podcast and announced that the average American had three friends, but wanted 15 friends, and that he could solve this by giving us chatbots instead of friends, we all dunked on him as an out-of-touch billionaire Martian who didn&#39;t understand the nature of friendship.</p>
<p>But the reality is that for Zuck, your friends are a problem. Your friends&#39; interactions with you determine how much time you spend on his platforms, and thus how many revenue-generating ads he can show you.</p>
<p>Your friends stubbornly refuse to organize their relationship with you in a way that maximizes the return to his shareholders. So Zuck is over there in Menlo Park, furiously fantasizing about replacing your friends with chatbots, because that way, he can finally realize the dream of a social media service without any socializing.</p>
<p>Rich, powerful people are, at root, solipsists. The only way to amass a billion dollars is to inflict misery and privation on whole populations. The only way to look yourself in the mirror after you&#39;ve done that, is to convince yourself that those people don&#39;t matter, that, in some important sense, they aren&#39;t <em>real</em>.</p>
<p>Think of Elon Musk calling everyone who disagrees with him an &#34;NPC,” or all those &#34;Effective Altruists,&#34; who claimed the moral high ground by claiming to care about 53 trillion imaginary artificial humans who will come into existence in 10,000 years at the expense of extending moral consideration to people alive today.</p>
<p>Or think of how Trump fired all the US government scientists, and then announced the &#34;Genesis&#34; program, declaring that the US would begin generating <em>annual</em> &#34;moonshot&#34;-scale breakthroughs, with a chatbot. It&#39;s science without scientists.</p>
<p>Chatbots can&#39;t really do science, but from Trump&#39;s perspective, they&#39;re still better than scientists, because a chatbot won&#39;t ever tell him not to stare at an eclipse, or not to inject bleach. A chatbot won&#39;t ever tell him that trans people exist, or that the climate emergency is real.</p>
<p>Powerful people are suckers for AI, because AI fuels the fantasy of a world without people: just a boss and a computer, and no ego-shattering confrontations with people who know how to <em>do</em> things telling you &#34;no.&#34;</p>
<p>AI is a way to produce tech debt at scale, to replace skilled writers with defective spicy autocomplete systems, to lose money at a rate not seen in living memory.</p>
<p>Now, compare that with the project of building a post-American internet: a project to <em>reduce</em> tech debt, to unlock America&#39;s monopoly trillions and divide them among the world&#39;s entrepreneurs (for whom they represent untold profits), and the world&#39;s technology users (for whom they represent untold savings); all while building resiliency and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Now, some of you are probably feeling pretty cynical about this right now. After all, your political leaders have demonstrated decades of ineffectual and incompetent deference to the US, and an inability to act, even when the need was dire. If your leaders couldn&#39;t act decisively on the climate emergency, what hope do we have of them taking this moment seriously?</p>
<p>But crises precipitate change. Remember when <em>another</em> mad emperor – Vladimir Putin – invaded Ukraine, and Europe experienced a dire energy shortage? In three short years, the continent&#39;s solar uptake skyrocketed. The EU went from being 15 years <em>behind</em> in its energy transition, to ten years <em>ahead</em> of schedule.</p>
<p>Because when you&#39;re shivering in the dark, a lot of fights you didn&#39;t think were worth it are suddenly existential battles you can&#39;t afford to lose. Sure, no one wants to argue with a tedious neighbor who has an aesthetic temper tantrum at the thought of a solar panel hanging from their neighbor&#39;s balcony.</p>
<p>But when it&#39;s winter, and there&#39;s no Russian gas, and you&#39;re shivering in the dark, then that person can take their aesthetic objection to balcony solar, fold it until it&#39;s all corners, and shove it right up their ass.</p>
<p>Besides, we don&#39;t need Europe to lead the charge on a post-American internet by repealing anticircumvention. <em>Any</em> country could do it! And the country that gets there first gets to reap the profits from supplying jailbreaking tools to the rest of the world, it gets to be the Disenshittification Nation, and everyone else in the world gets to buy those tools and defend themselves from US tech companies&#39; monetary and privacy plunder.</p>
<p>Just one country has to break the consensus, and the case for every country doing so is the strongest it&#39;s ever been. It used to be that countries that depended on USAID had to worry about losing food, medical and cash supports if they pissed off America. But Trump killed USAID, so now that&#39;s a dead letter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, America&#39;s status as the planet&#39;s most voracious consumer has been gutted by decades of anti-worker, pro-billionaire policies. Today, the US is in the grips of its third consecutive &#34;K-shaped&#34; recovery, that&#39;s an economic rally where the rich get richer, and everyone else gets poorer. For a generation, America papered over that growing inequality with easy credit, with everyday Americans funding their consumption with credit cards and second and third mortgages.</p>
<p>So long as they could all afford to keep buying, other countries had to care about America as an export market. But a generation of extraction has left the bottom 90% of Americans struggling to buy groceries and other necessities, carrying crushing debt from skyrocketing shelter, education and medical expenses that they can&#39;t hope to pay down, thanks to 50 years of wage stagnation.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has sided firmly with debt collectors, price gougers, and rent extractors. Trump neutered enforcement against rent-fixing platforms like Realpage, restarted debt payments for eight million student borrowers, and killed a plan to make live-saving drugs a little cheaper, leaving Americans to continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world.</p>
<p>Every dollar spent servicing a loan is a dollar that can&#39;t go to consumption. And as more and more Americans slip into poverty, the US is gutting programs that spend money on the public&#39;s behalf, like SNAP, the food stamps program that helps an ever-larger slice of the American public stave off hunger.</p>
<p>America is chasing the &#34;world without people&#34; dream, where working people have nothing, spend nothing, and turn every penny over to rentiers who promptly flush that money into the stock market, shitcoins, or gambling sites. But I repeat myself.</p>
<p>Even the US military – long a sacrosanct institution – is being kneecapped to enrich rent-seekers. Congress just killed a military &#34;right to repair&#34; law. So now, US soldiers stationed abroad will have to continue the Pentagon&#39;s proud tradition of shipping materiel from generators to jeeps back to America to be fixed by their manufacturers at a 10,000% markup, because the Pentagon routinely signs maintenance contracts that prohibit it from teaching a Marine how to fix an engine.</p>
<p>The post-American world is really coming on fast. As we repeal our anticircumvention laws, we don&#39;t have to care what America thinks, we don&#39;t have to care about their tariffs, because they&#39;re already whacking us with tariffs; and because the only people left in the US who can afford to buy things are rich people, who just don&#39;t buy enough stuff. There&#39;s only so many Lambos and Sub-Zeros even the most guillotineable plute can usefully own.</p>
<p>But what if <em>European</em> firms want to go on taking advantage of anticircumvention laws? Well, there&#39;s good news there, too. &#34;Good news,&#34; because the EU firms that rely on anticircumvention are engaged in the sleaziest, most disgusting frauds imaginable.</p>
<p>Anticircumvention law is the reason that Volkswagen could get away with Dieselgate. By imposing legal liability on reverse-engineers who might have discovered this lethal crime, Article 6 of the Copyright Directive created a chilling effect, and thousands of Europeans died, every year.</p>
<p>Today, Germany&#39;s storied automakers are carrying on the tradition of Dieselgate, sabotaging their cars to extract rent from drivers. From Mercedes, which rents you the accelerator pedal in your luxury car, only unlocking the full acceleration curve of your engine if you buy a monthly subscription; to BMW, which rents you the automated system that automatically dims your high-beams if there&#39;s oncoming traffic.</p>
<p>Legalize jailbreaking and any mechanic in Europe could unlock those subscription features for one price, and not share <em>any</em> of that money with BMW and Mercedes.</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s Medtronic, a company that pretends it is Irish. Medtronic is the world&#39;s largest med-tech company, having purchased all their competitors, and then undertaken the largest &#34;tax-inversion&#34; in history, selling themselves to a tiny Irish firm, in order to magick their profits into a state of untaxable grace, floating in the Irish Sea.</p>
<p>Medtronic supplies the world&#39;s most widely used ventilators, and it booby-traps them the same way John Deere booby-traps its tractors. After a hospital technician puts a new part in a Medtronic ventilator, the ventilator&#39;s central computing unit refuses to recognize the part until it completes a cryptographic handshake, proving that an authorized Medtronic technician was paid hundreds of euros to certify a repair that the hospital&#39;s own technician probably performed.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just a way to suck hundreds of euros out of hospitals every time a ventilator breaks. This would be bad enough, but during the covid lockdowns, when every ventilator was desperately needed, and when the planes stopped flying, there was no way for a Medtronic tech to come and bless the hospital technicians&#39; repairs. This was lethal. It killed people.</p>
<p>There&#39;s one more European company that relies on anticircumvention that I want to discuss here, because they&#39;re old friends of CCC: that&#39;s the Polish train company Newag. Newag sabotages its own locomotives, booby-trapping them so that if they sense they have been taken to a rival&#39;s service yard, the train bricks itself. When the train operator calls Newag about this mysterious problem, the company &#34;helpfully&#34; remotes into the locomotive&#39;s computers, to perform &#34;diagnostics,&#34; which is just sending a unbricking command to the vehicle, a service for which they charge 20,000 euros.</p>
<p>Last year, Polish hackers from the security research firm Dragon Sector presented on their research into this disgusting racket in this very hall, and now, they&#39;re being sued by Newag under anticircumvention law, for making absolutely true disclosures about Newag&#39;s deliberately defective products.</p>
<p>So these are the European stakeholders for anticircumvention law: the Dieselgate killers, the car companies who want to rent you your high-beams and accelerator, the med-tech giant that bricked all the ventilators during the pandemic, and the company that tied Poland to the train-tracks.</p>
<p>I relish the opportunity to fight these bastards in Brussels, as they show up and cry &#34;Won&#39;t someone think of the train saboteurs?&#34;</p>
<p>The enshittification of technology – the decay of the platforms and systems we rely on – has many causes: the collapse of competition, regulatory capture, the smashing of tech workers&#39; power. But most of all, enshittification is the result of anticircumvention law&#39;s ban on interoperability.</p>
<p>By blocking interop, by declaring war on the general-purpose computer, our policy-makers created an enshittogenic environment that rewarded companies for being shitty, and ushered in the enshittocene, in which everything is turning to shit.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s call time on enshittification. Let&#39;s seize the means of computation. Let&#39;s build the drop-in, free, open, auditable alternatives to the services and firmware we rely on.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s end the era of silos. I mean, isn&#39;t it fucking <em>weird</em> how you have to care which network someone is using if you want to talk to them? Instead of just deciding <em>who</em> you want to talk to?</p>
<p>The fact that you have to figure out whether the discussion you&#39;re trying to join is on Twitter or Bluesky, Mastodon or Instagram – that is just the most Prodigy/AOL/Compuserve-ass way of running a digital world. I mean, 1990 called and they want their walled gardens back</p>
<p>Powerful allies are joining our side in the War on General Purpose Computation. It&#39;s not just people like us, who&#39;ve been fighting for this whole goddamned century, but also countries that want to convert American tech&#39;s hoarded trillions into fuel for a single-use rocket that boosts their own tech sector into a stable orbit.</p>
<p>It&#39;s national security hawks who are worried about Trump bricking their ministries or their tractors, and who are also worried – with just cause – about Xi Jinping bricking all their solar inverters and batteries. Because, after all, the post-American internet is also a post-Chinese internet!</p>
<p>Nothing should be designed to be field updatable without the user&#39;s permission. Nothing critical should be a black box.</p>
<p>Like I said at the start of this talk, I have been doing this work for 24 years at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, throwing myself at a door that was double-locked and deadbolted, and now that door is open a crack and goddammit, I am <em>hopeful</em>.</p>
<p>Not optimistic. Fuck optimism! Optimism is the idea that things will get better no matter what we do. I know that what we do matters. Hope is the belief that if we can improve things, even in small ways, we can ascend the gradient toward the world we want, and attain higher vantage points from which new courses of action, invisible to us here at our lower elevation, will be revealed.</p>
<p>Hope is a discipline. It requires that you not give in to despair. So I&#39;m here to tell you: don&#39;t despair.</p>
<p>All this decade, all over the world, countries have taken up arms against concentrated corporate power. We&#39;ve had big, muscular antitrust attacks on big corporations in the US (under Trump I <em>and</em> Biden); in Canada; in the UK; in the EU and member states like Germany, France and Spain; in Australia; in Japan and South Korea and Singapore; in Brazil; and in <em>China</em>.</p>
<p>This is a near-miraculous turn of affairs. All over the world, governments are declaring war on monopolies, the source of billionaires&#39; wealth and power.</p>
<p>Even the most forceful wind is invisible. We can only see it by its effects. What we&#39;re seeing here is that whenever a politician bent on curbing corporate power unfurls a sail, no matter where in the world that politician is, that sail fills with wind and propels the policy in ways that haven&#39;t been seen in generations.</p>
<p>The long becalming of the fight over corporate power has ended, and a fierce, unstoppable wind is blowing. It&#39;s not just blowing in Europe, or in Canada, or in South Korea, Japan, China, Australia or Brazil. It&#39;s blowing in America, too. Never forget that as screwed up and terrifying as things are in America, the country has experienced, and continues to experience, a tsunami of antitrust bills and enforcement actions at the local, state and federal level.</p>
<p>And never forget that the post-American internet will be <em>good for Americans</em>. Because, in a K-shaped, bifurcated, unequal America, the trillions that American companies loot from the world don&#39;t trickle down to Americans. The average American holds a portfolio of assets that rounds to zero, and that includes stock in US tech companies.</p>
<p>The average American isn&#39;t a shareholder in Big Tech, the average American is a <em>victim</em> of Big Tech. Liberating the world from US Big Tech is also liberating America from US Big Tech.</p>
<p>That&#39;s been EFF&#39;s mission for 35 years. It&#39;s been my mission at EFF for 25 years. If you want to get involved in this fight – and I hope you do – it can be your mission, too. You can join EFF, and you can join groups in your own country, like Netzpolitik here in Germany, or the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, or La Quadrature du Net in France, or the Open Rights Group in the UK, or EF Finland, or ISOC Bulgaria, XNet, DFRI, Quintessenz, Bits of Freedom, Openmedia, FSFE, or any of dozens of organizations around the world.</p>
<p>The door is open a crack, the wind is blowing, the post-American internet is upon us: a new, good internet that delivers all the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 so that our normie friends can use it, too.</p>
<p>And I can&#39;t wait for all of us to get to hang out there. It&#39;s gonna be <em>great</em>.</p>
