        <h2 id="1st-week-rc">1st week @ RC:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Met a bunch of super interesting people and already have way too many ideas buzzing around in my head.</li>
<li>Went to my first virtual board game event and it was honestly way more fun than I expected — laughed so much.</li>
<li>Published my first blog post in forever — pretty big win for Week 1 since I usually procrastinate like crazy on writing anything up.</li>
<li>Showed up for all the orientation stuff, figured out the social rules (especially the Not-To-Dos and how to apologize if I mess up — still trying to break the “well actually…” habit in personal life).</li>
<li>Started using Cursor — jury’s still out, but so far I like it.</li>
<li>Pair programmed twice — wild how much you pick up just watching how someone else uses their setup. Discovered Codeberg, people’s Vim workflows, Emacs tricks — it’s like peeking into other people’s kitchens while they&#39;re making their secret recipe.</li>
<li>Coded “Mastermind” from scratch in Python — felt good to build something simple end-to-end.</li>
<li>Went to a couple of non-coding sessions too — film theory and labyrinths. No clue what I was getting into, but they made me think in totally different ways.</li>
<li>Did my first virtual check-in — a bit awkward but good to say stuff out loud.</li>
<li>Loved the “how to build your volition muscles” workshop — gave me some good food for thought on sticking with my projects.</li>
<li>Got through the first two chapters of AI Engineering by Chip Huyen. Good reminder that I still love reading textbooks, in small doses at least.</li>
<li>Also coded up attention and transformers from scratch in PyTorch — felt nice to get my hands dirty instead of just reading about it.</li>
<li>Watched the first CS336 lecture on LLMs from scratch. Hoping I stick with this one — I’ve dropped way too many online courses before.</li>
<li>Getting the hang of Zulip. Still fumbling around with shortcuts and threads, but it’s clicking bit by bit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-build-your-volition-muscles-workshop-notes">&#34;How to build your Volition Muscles&#34; : Workshop Notes</h2>
<p>Did the “Build Your Volition Muscles” workshop this week — we jotted down ideas, dug into the “why,” and sorted them by priority. Here’s where I landed for Week 1. Curious to see how these shift as I go.</p>
<p><strong>P0:</strong> Stuff I should be moving on right now.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Idea</th><th>Why (Reasoning)</th><th>Priority Bucket</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Complete UC-Berkeley LLM for agents course</td><td>I want to get solid at building actual agents, not just toy demos.</td><td>P1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Complete CS-336</td><td>Feels like a must-have if I want a deep grasp of LLM internals.</td><td>P0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Finish <em>AI Engineering</em> by Chip Huyen</td><td>This has been on my list forever — time to finally dig in properly.</td><td>P0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Complete zero-to-hero course</td><td>To fill in any gaps and see another perspective on LLMs.</td><td>P2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Build Mastermind with a good front-end</td><td>I want to learn how to tie back-end and front-end together well.</td><td>P0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Event website</td><td>Another shot at full-stack skills — plus it sounds fun.</td><td>P1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Make a practical agent using what I learn</td><td>Just for the joy of making something that works in the real world.</td><td>P2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Write weekly blog posts</td><td>I miss writing regularly — want to get back into the groove.</td><td>P0 + P1 + P2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Take good notes &amp; do mini presentations</td><td>Helps me process things and tackle my stage fright head-on.</td><td>P0 + P1 + P2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pair program as much as possible</td><td>Best way to learn — seeing other workflows is eye-opening.</td><td>P0 + P1 + P2</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Curious which ones I’ll actually stick with — let’s see where Week 2 goes.</p>
