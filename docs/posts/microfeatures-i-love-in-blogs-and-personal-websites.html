    <h1>Microfeatures I love in blogs and personal websites</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Some time ago, Hillel Wayne published an article titled
<a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/microfeatures-id-like-to-see-in-more-languages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Microfeatures I’d like to see in more languages</em><svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
In this article, he described three kinds of features in <em>programming languages</em>:
fundamental features, deeply engrained features, and nice-to-have convenience features.
Hillel’s premise was that language designers tend to focus on the first two;
however, because the convenience features are relatively low-overhead, it’s
easier for them to jump between projects, and they provide a quality-of-life
increase.</p>
<p>I’ve been running a blog for a while — some of the oldest posts I’ve found
(which are no longer reflected on this site due to their low quality) were from
2015. In this time, I’ve been on the lookout for ways to improve the site,
and I’ve seen quite a few little things that are nice to use, but relatively
easy to implement. They don’t really make or break a website; the absence of
such features might be noticed, but will not cause any disruption for the reader.
On the other hand, their presence serves as a QoL enhancement. I find these to be
analogous to Hillel’s notion of “microfeatures”. If you’re interested in adding
something to your site, consider browsing this menu to see if anything resonates!</p>
<p>One last thing is that this post is not necessarily about microfeatures
I’d like <em>every</em> blog or personal website to have. Some ideas I present
here are only well-suited to certain types of content and certain written
voices. They need not be applied indiscriminately.</p>
<p>With that, let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="sidenotes">Sidenotes</h3>
<p><a href="https://gwern.net/me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwern<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> is, in my view, the king of sidenotes.
Gwern’s writing makes very heavy use of them (at least based on the articles
that I’ve read). This is where I originally got inspiration for
<a href="https://danilafe.com/blog/sidenotes/">my own implementation in Hugo</a>. Check out the page
on <a href="https://gwern.net/hydrocephalus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydrocephalus<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> for an example; Here’s what
a piece of that page looks like on my end at the time of writing:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/gwern-sidenotes.png" alt="A screenshot of Gwern&#39;s page on hydrocephalus. The main article text is accompanied by notes in both the left and right margin."/><figcaption>
      <p>A screenshot of Gwern’s page on hydrocephalus</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sidenotes are nice because they allow for diversions without interrupting
the main article’s flow. You can provide additional details for the curious
reader, or — <a href="https://gwern.net/hydrocephalus#sn4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Gwern does<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> —
use the sidenotes for citing studies or sources. In either case, the reading
experience is significantly more pleasant that footnotes, for which you typically
have to go to the bottom of the page, and then return to the top.</p>
<p>Another reason I called Gwern the “king of sidenotes” is
<a href="https://gwern.net/sidenote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page on sidenotes<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>. There, Gwern documents
numerous approaches to this feature, mostly inspired by <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tufte CSS<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
The page is very thorough — it even includes a link to my own work, as unknown
as it may be! I would recommend checking it out if you are interested in
enhancing your site with sidenotes.</p>
<h3 id="tables-of-contents">Tables of Contents</h3>
<p>Not all personal sites include tables of contents (TOCs), but they are nice.
They serve two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seeing at a glance what the post will be about, in the form of headings.</li>
<li>Being able to navigate to an interesting part of the page without
having to scroll.</li>
</ol>
<p>Static site generators (I myself use <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>) are
typically able to generate TOCs automatically, since they are already generating
the HTML and know what headings they are inserting into the page. For instance,
Hugo has <a href="https://gohugo.io/methods/page/tableofcontents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>TableOfContents</code><svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
I suspect the same is true for other existing website technologies.</p>
<p>Despite this, I actually had to look relatively long to find sites I frequent that have
TOCs to show off as examples here. The first one I came across — after Gwern’s,
whose site will be mentioned plenty in this post anyway — is <a href="https://fasterthanli.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faster than Lime<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
Take this post on <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/understanding-rust-futures-by-going-way-too-deep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust’s Futures<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>;
this is what the top of it looks like at the time of writing:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/fasterthanlime-toc.png" alt="A screenshot of the table of contents on Faster than Lime. A box with the word &#34;Contents&#34; contains links to several sections on the page bellow (off screen)"/><figcaption>
      <p>A screenshot of the table of contents on Faster than Lime</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The quality and value of TOCs certainly depends on the
sections within the page itself — and whether or not the page has sections
at all! — but in my opinion, the benefits to navigation become apparent even
for relatively simple pages.</p>
<p>As an honorable mention, I’d like to show <a href="https://lars.hupel.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lars Hupel’s site<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
The pages on the site don’t — as far as I can tell — have <em>internal</em> tables
of contents. However, pages that are part of a series — such as
the <a href="https://lars.hupel.info/topics/crdt/01-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduction to CRDTs<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> —
have tables of contents that span the entire series.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/lars-toc.png" alt="A screenshot of the table of contents on Lars Hupel&#39;s site. A box with the words &#34;Series Navigation&#34; contains links to several other pages in the series."/><figcaption>
      <p>A screenshot of the table of contents on Lars Hupel’s site</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I also find this very nice, though it does miss out on headings within a page.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-showing-page-progress">Bonus: Showing Page Progress</h4>
<p>I’ve mentioned that tables of contents can communicate the structure of the
page. However, they do so from the outset, before you’ve started reading.
In their “base form”, the reader stops benefiting from tables of contents
<span>
<label for="jump-top-note">once they&#39;ve started reading.</label>
<span><span>[note:</span>
That is, of course, unless they jump back to the top of the post and
find the table of contents again.
<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>If you want to show progress while the reader is somewhere in the middle
of a page, you could use a page progress bar. I’ve noticed one while
reading <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quanta Magazine<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>; it looks like
this (recording my scrolling through
the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-square-root-of-2-became-a-number-20240621/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recent article at the time of writing<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>).</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/quanta-scroll.gif" alt="The progress bar on a Quanta Magazine article. As the page scrolls, an orange bar at the top gradually fills up from left to right."/><figcaption>
      <p>The progress bar on a Quanta Magazine article</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One immediate thought is that this is completely superseded by the regular
browser scroll bar that’s ever-present at the side of the page. However,
the scroll bar could be deceiving. If your page has a comments section,
the comments could make the page look dauntingly long. Similarly, references
to other pages and general “footer material” count towards the scroll bar,
but would not count towards the progress bar.</p>
<p>Combining the two, you could imagine an always-visible table of contents
that highlights the current section you’re in. With such a feature, you
can always see where you are (including a rough estimate of how far into
the page you’ve scrolled), and at the same time see how the current section
integrates into the broader structure. I’ve seen this done before, but could
not find a site off the top of my head that implements the feature; as a
fallback, here’s the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/sticky-table-of-contents-with-scrolling-active-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS tricks tutorial<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>
that shows how to implement a dynamic table of contents, and a recording
of me scrolling through it:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/csstricks-toc.gif" alt="The table of contents from a CSS Tricks demo. As the page scrolls, the current section in the table of contents becomes bold."/><figcaption>

</figure>

<h3 id="easily-linkable-headings">Easily Linkable Headings</h3>
<p>How can you link a particular section of a page to your friend? There’s a
well-defined mechanism to do this in HTML: you can use the ID of a particular
HTML element, and add it as <code>#some-id</code> to the end of a link to the page. The
link then takes the user to that particular HTML element. I can do this,
for instance, to link to the <a href="#sidenotes">sidenotes section above<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>.</p>
<p>How does one discover the ID of the part of the page that they want to
link to? The ID is not a “visual” property; it’s not displayed to the user,
and is rather a detail of HTML itself. Thus, on any given page, even
if every element has a unique, linkable ID, I can’t make use of it without
going into <strong>Inspect Element</strong> and trying to find the ID in the HTML tree.</p>
<p id="linked-paragraph">The simple solution is to make the elements that you want to be easily “linkable”
into links to themselves! Then, the user can right-click
the element in question (probably the heading) and click <strong>Copy Link</strong>.
Much easier! To demonstrate a similar idea, <a href="#linked-paragraph">here is a link to this paragraph itself</a>.
You can now use the context menu to <strong>Copy Link</strong>, put it in your browser,
and voilà — you’re right back here!</p>
<p>As with <a href="#tables-of-contents">tables of contents<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>, many website technologies
provide most of the tooling to add support for this feature. Relatively
often I come across pages that have unique IDs for each header, but no clickable
links! I end up having to use inspect element to find the anchor points.</p>
<p>A variation on this idea — if you don’t want to make the entire heading or title
a link — is to include alongside it (before or after) a clickable element
that is a link to that title. You can click that element to retrieve link
information, instead (and the icon additionally tells you that this is possible).
Hugo’s documentation does this: here’s a screenshot of
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/markdown-attributes/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an arbitrary page<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/hugo-titlelink.png" alt="A title and paragraph from the Hugo documentation. Next to the title there is a blue link symbol."/><figcaption>

<h3 id="grouping-series-of-posts">Grouping Series of Posts</h3>
<p>Some authors like to write at length on a particular topic; to get the
content out to readers faster (and to make the resulting pages less daunting),
it makes sense to break a single topic up into a series. The easiest way
to do this is to just… publish several articles, possibly with related
names, and link them to each other. Done!</p>
<p>With a little more effort, though, the series-reading and series-writing
experience could be nicer. Instead of manually inserting links, you
could configure your website to automatically add a “next” and “previous”
button to pages in a given series. You could also give an overview of a particular
series and create a “navigation hub” for it.</p>
<p>As an example, the <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapel language blog<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> has navigation
buttons. Here’s a screenshot from <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/blog/posts/aoc2022-day09-elvish-string-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post in the Advent of Code series<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/chapel-seriesnav.png" alt="Series navigation buttons on a Chapel blog post. There are two buttons; one links to a previous page in the series, another links to the next."/><figcaption>

</figure>

<p>I’ve mentioned this in the section on <a href="#tables-of-contents">tables of contents<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>,
but <a href="https://lars.hupel.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lars Hupel’s site<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> has tables of contents
that link between series. I’m not sure if it’s automatically generated
or hand-written, but it’s definitely nice.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/lars-toc.png" alt="A screenshot of the table of contents on Lars Hupel&#39;s site. A box with the words &#34;Series Navigation&#34; contains links to several other pages in the series."/><figcaption>
      <p>A screenshot of the table of contents on Lars Hupel’s site</p>

<h3 id="dialogues">Dialogues</h3>
<p>I first came across dialogues on <a href="https://xeiaso.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xe Iaso’s site<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>,
but I think I see them used most often in posts on <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faster than Lime<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
As an example, here’s a little dialogue on <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/understanding-rust-futures-by-going-way-too-deep#it-s-waiting-for-the-first-one-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post about Rust’s futures<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
At the time of writing, it looks like this:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/fasterthanlime-dialogue.png" alt="A dialogue with &#34;cool bear&#34; on Faster than Lime. The page contains chat bubbles that alternate between a bear character and the author."/><figcaption>
      <p>A dialogue with “cool bear” on Faster than Lime</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Using dialogues — even for technical writing — is not a particularly novel
idea. I know I’ve seen it in a textbook before; probably
this part of <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/dialogue-virtualization.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
It can help ask questions from a less-experienced point of view, and therefore
possibly voice concerns that a reader might themselves be having. And of course
— as with “cool bear” and Xe Iaso’s <a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many characters<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>
— it can change the tone and make the page a bit more fun.</p>
<h3 id="code-blocks-with-origin">Code Blocks with Origin</h3>
<p>This one was recommended to me by a reader, and so I’ll be talking about
my page specifically!</p>
<p>When I was <a href="https://danilafe.com/series/compiling-a-functional-language-using-c++/">writing about making a compiler</a>,
a reader emailed me and pointed out that they were getting lost in the various
code blocks. My page displayed the code that I was writing about, but the
project had grown beyond a single file. As a result, I’d be making changes
midway through one file at one moment, and another file the next. This
prompted me to add decorators to my code blocks that look
something like this:</p>





<div data-base-path="" data-file-path="patterns/patterns.rb" data-first-line="3" data-last-line="8">
    
<div>
<div>
<table><tbody><tr>
<td>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span><span>7
</span><span>8
</span></code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="Ruby"><span><span><span>def</span> <span>sum_digits</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>while</span> <span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>9</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>n</span><span>.</span><span>to_s</span><span>.</span><span>chars</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>:to_i</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>n</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>end</span></span></span></code></pre>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The decorator says what file the code is from, as well as what lines
are being presented. If you click the file name, the decorator links
to my Gitea instance, allowing you to read the code in context.</p>
<p>Though it’s not quite the same (in particular, it’s unfortunately missing
links), the Crafting Interpreters online book does something similar. It
describes changes to the code in words next to the changed code itself,
like “added after <code>MyStruct</code>”. Here’s a screenshot of the page on
<a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/local-variables.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local variables<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>
at the time of writing.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/craftinginterpreters-codenotes.png" alt="Location notes on code in Crafting Interpreters. On the right of code blocks, a margin note describes the file and nature of the change."/><figcaption>
      <p>Location notes on code in Crafting Interpreters</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I think it looks quite elegant, and in some ways — specifically in
the verbal descriptions of what each change does — might be superior to my
approach.</p>
<p>It’s not quite the same thing, but <a href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Gists<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>
can help approximate this feature. A Gist could contain multiple files,
and each file can be individually embedded into your page. Hugo in particular has
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#gist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in support<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> for
Gists (and I’ve snagged that link using the docs’ <a href="#easily-linkable-headings">easily linkable headings<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>);
I suspect that other website engines have some form of support
as well. At the time of writing, an embedded Gist looks something like this:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/hugo-gist.png" alt="Code embedded in Hugo documentation using a GitHub Gist."/><figcaption>
      <p>Code embedded in Hugo documentation using a GitHub Gist</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Clicking <code>list.html</code> takes you to the source code of the file.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-code-blocks-with-clickable-links">Bonus: Code Blocks with Clickable Links</h4>
<p>If we’re going for fancy code blocks, another fancy feature is provided
by the <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/what-is-agda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agda programming language<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
Agda can generate HTML code blocks in which every symbol (like a variable,
record name, function name) are linked to where they are defined. So if
you’re reading the code, and wonder “what the heck is <code>x</code>?”, you can just
click it to see how it’s defined.</p>
<p>It’s not simple to integrate Agda’s plain HTML output into an existing
webpage, but some projects do that. I took a stab at it in
my <a href="https://danilafe.com/blog/agda_hugo/">post about integrating it with Hugo</a>.
I wager this would be even harder for other languages. However, it leads
to nice results; my go-to is <a href="https://plfa.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming Languages Foundations in Agda<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
The online book introduces various concepts from Programming Language Theory,
and each code block that it shows is fully linked. This makes it possible
to jump around the page like so:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/plfa-goto.gif" alt="Navigating code blocks on a page from PLFA. I hover over then click a plus sign to see how addition is defined. I then do the same to see how natural numbers are defined."/><figcaption>

<h3 id="markers-for-external-links">Markers for External Links</h3>
<p>Some sites I’ve seen mark links that go to a different domain with
a little icon. If you’ve read this far, you’ve likely noticed that my
site does the same. Another good example of this — even though the CSS
is little rough at the time of writing — is <a href="https://jamesg.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James’ Coffee Blog ☕<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
I’ve taken the (small) liberty to adjust the color of the icon, which
I suspect is buggy in my browser.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/jamesg-external.png" alt="An external link on James&#39; blog. The link is displayed as normal, and an additional diagonal arrow aiming up and to the right and surrounded by a square is displayed to the right of the link text."/><figcaption>
      <p>An external link on James’ blog</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some websites (this one included) also make such links open in a new tab
automatically. That way, you tend to not lose the original article by clicking
through one of its references.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-different-markers-for-different-destinations">Bonus: Different Markers for Different Destinations</h4>
<p><a href="https://gwern.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwern’s website<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> takes this idea further, by changing
the icon for external links depending on the destination. For instance,
links to Wikipedia articles are stylized with a little “W”, links to
Haskell.org are stylized using a lambda (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span><span></span><span>λ</span></span></span></span>), and links to
<code>.zip</code> files have a little archive icon. There are more; I’ve found
the <a href="https://github.com/gwern/gwern.net/blob/959ba9c50d327a960e07241b2c7f13630bf8b80c/js/old/links.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link processing code on GitHub<svg>

and even the <a href="https://github.com/gwern/gwern.net/blob/959ba9c50d327a960e07241b2c7f13630bf8b80c/js/old/links.js#L380-L387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of websites that get their own icons<svg>

I could not find a verbal description, though.</p>
<p>Now for some pictures. Here are a ton of links from
the <a href="https://gwern.net/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“About”<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>

<h4 id="bonus-link-preview">Bonus: Link Preview</h4>
<p><a href="https://gwern.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwern’s website<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> has no shortage of cool ideas. Among
them showing link previews on hover. When hovering over a link, the site
displays a popup window that contains a view into that page. I suspect that
this view is also archived somehow, so that it retains a view into the
page that matches it at the time of writing.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, I found this feature a little jarring at first.
As I would try to click links, I would get surprised by an additional overlay.
However, as I spent more time browsing the site, I grew quite accustomed to
the previews. I would hover over a link to see the first paragraph and
thus get a short synopsis. This worked really well in tandem with
<a href="#bonus-different-markers-for-different-destinations">per-destination marker icons<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>;
I could tell at a glance whether a link was worth hovering over.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/gwern-hover.gif" alt="Hovering over a link on Gwern&#39;s site. After the link is hovered over, a rectangular popup displays a section of the Wikipedia page the link goes to. I scroll through the section to the table of contents."/><figcaption>

<p>RSS is a feed standard that allows sites to publish updates. Blogs in
particular can make use of RSS to notify readers of updates.
RSS feeds are processed by a feed reader, which is a program that polls
a website’s <code>index.xml</code> file (or other similar files) and reads it to
detect new content. If you opt in to full-text RSS feeds, users can read
the entire post entirely from their reader.</p>
<p>RSS makes it easier to keep up with your site. Rather than having
to check in on every author whose content I enjoy on the internet, I can
add their feed URL to my list, and have my feed reader automatically aggregate
all updates for me to read. It’s kind of like a social media or news feed,
except that I control what’s shown to me, and authors of the blogs I follow
don’t need to create accounts and explicitly share their work on social media!</p>
<p>I don’t have any particular website to show off in this section; instead
I’ll show you a list of websites that I’m following in my feed reader of choice.
You might notice that a lot of these websites are listed here as inspiration
for other microfeatures.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/feedbin.png" alt="A screenshot of my Feedbin list. Some sites include Hillel Wayne&#39;s, Faster than Lime, Drew DeVault, and the Chapel Language Blog"/><figcaption>

<h3 id="links-to-other-sites">Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>This feature I first noticed on Drew DeVault’s blog. Every page on Drew’s
blog, at the bottom, has a section titled “Articles from blogs I read”.
For instance, on <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2024/05/24/2024-05-24-Bunnix.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a sample post<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>,
at the time of writing, I’m seeing the following footer:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/drew-openring.png" alt="Links to other blogs from Drew DeVault&#39;s blog. The links consist of three side-by-side boxes, each with a title and brief excerpt."/><figcaption>

</figure>

<p>As indicated in the image, Drew’s site in particular uses a program
called <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>openring</code><svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>, which is based on
RSS feeds (another <a href="#rss-feeds">microfeature I love<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>). However,
<em>how</em> the site finds such articles (statically like <code>openring</code>, or
on page load using some JavaScript) isn’t hugely important to me. What’s
important is that you’re promoting other content creators whose work
you enjoy, which is the ethos of my favorite slice of the internet.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion--anything-else">Conclusion + Anything Else?</h3>
<p>Those are all the microfeatures that I could think of in a single sitting.
I hope that you have been inspired to integrate features like these into
your own site, or at the very least that you think doing so would be a good idea.</p>
<p>This list isn’t exhaustive. I’ve probably missed some good microfeatures!
If you can think of such a feature, let me know; my email address is linked
in the footer of this article.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, and cheers!</p>
