        <p>Honestly I just wanted to play around with gradients. But gradients without anything on the horizon lack
          something, so I added horses. Since I can&#39;t draw horses, now <i>you</i>
          can draw them. And watch them parade across the screen alongside horses drawn by people you probably wouldn&#39;t
          like. Or maybe you would, how should I know?!</p>

        <p><strong>Click/tap</strong> a horse to make it jump forward with joy.</p>

        <p>We actually analyze each horse drawing using AGI (Artificial Goose Intelligence), and filter out drawings
          that appear un-horse-like. If you want to see them anyhow, activate the SHOW NON-HORSES option.
