    <h1>Chili Oil Notes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I’ve been getting a little obsessed with chili oil. A little…lost in
the sauce so to speak. Here’s some notes and general thoughts on chili oil.</p>

<p>There are two main ways of extracting flavor from chilies with oil:
hot flash or slow infusion. A hot flash basically means you heat up
the oil until it’s really hot, almost smoking , i.e. 375F. You pour it
over the chilies in one dramatic swoop. A slow infusion is less
dramatic. You heat the oil and infuse the chilies at a lower
temperature, say 200-250F.</p>
<p>In my experiments, the hot flash produces a noticably more intense
flavor with some roasted notes. However, with that flavor, there is
some bitterness. The slow infusion comes out milder, but no
bitterness. That said I’ve only tried at the above
temperatures. Perhaps a slow infusion at 250-300F or a hot flash at
325F could be better?</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the hot flash creates an oil with the chili
pieces noticably suspended in the oil, while the slow infusion results
in an oil with the pieces all at the bottom. I suspect this is because
the chili pieces are more intensely fried in the hot flash one, which
either dissolves more soluble materials into the oil, making them
lighter, or causes the pieces to unfurl and be more buoyant.</p>
<p>In some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo0aGgCuvH4">Chinese
videos</a> that I’ve
watched, people do a sort of hybrid style where you add hot oil
multiple times, with the idea to almost “temper” the oil, i.e. not put
such a large quantity of hot oil into the chilies all at once. I could
see that working too. They also temper with baijiu, i.e. strong
Chinese liquor. That could also potentially be another avenue for
extraction since alcohol is known to extract more flavor compounds
than water? Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, so maybe this could boost
spiciness?</p>
<p>This does put into question whether the ratio of oil to solid material
matters. I usually make the Serious Eats <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-spicy-chili-crisp">chili
crisp</a> recipe
by Sohla El-Waylly. It uses the hot flash method, but it also includes
a lot of other ingredients like ginger, cardamom, cumin, sugar,
mushroom powder, etc. Perhaps the sheer quantity of solids means more
thermal mass and therefore less overcooking?</p>
<p>I’ve also thought about doing a really low and slow extraction, say by
using a sous vide machine. You do run into food safety issues, since
the chilies can contain botulism.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could try doing multiple extractions at different
temperatures or even blending different styles.</p>

<p>The easiest oil to use is a neutral oil of your choosing. It won’t add
any flavor, which will let the chilies shine through. This is fairly
important for experiments since you don’t want the taste of the oil to
obscure results (I learned this the hard way).</p>
<p>But there are some other options. Classic Sichuan oil is caiziyou, or
roasted rapeseed oil. It’s hard to find in the US, but you can get it
at more and more Chinese supermarkets or <a href="https://themalamarket.com/collections/regional-chinese-sauces-pickles/products/caizi-you-sichuan-roasted-rapeseed-oil">online at Mala
Market</a>. At
a Chinese supermarket, you’ll probably have to read some Chinese to
make sure you’re buying the right stuff. Caiziyou is nutty, roasted,
almost like a milder sesame oil. It’s great stuff to cook with and it
does make a nice chili oil. Budget-wise it is more expensive,
especially if you’re buying from Mala Market.</p>
<p>I’ve also seen people use clarified butter, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZJtOATAZl4">like
here</a>, or beef fat like
in hot pot bases. I imagine an olive oil could be good if you stick to
slow infusion.</p>
<p>Of course there are also combinations that could be made. Maybe a
chili oil with a little spike of beef fat just for flavor.</p>

<p>I usually keep quite a few different kinds of dried chilies
around. Right now I have Thai birds-eyes, er ting jiao, xiao mi la,
kashmiri, Japones. Of course it’s hard to determine what exactly a lot
of chilies are, since there could be multiple names depending on the
country. Perhaps Japones are really Heaven-Facing chilies. Or xiao mi
la is birds-eye.</p>
<p>I used to spike the oil with some extra spicy chilies like ghost
peppers or Carolina reapers. I stopped doing that because they were
way more expensive than other chilies, it was extremely painful to
seed them and grind, and I wasn’t convinced they actually added that
much heat. One or two ghost peppers could easily be matched by a
couple handfuls of birds-eye or xiao mi la. Especially since these
super hot peppers are not always consistent in spice level. I did once
make a chili oil with chocolate bhutlah that was delightfully spicy.</p>
<p>I also used to spike the oil with some chipotle peppers to add some
smokiness. I might do an experiment to see how much of a difference
that actually made.</p>

<p>Recipes run the gamut of no spices at all to lots and lots of
spices. Generally I’m of the view that more spices are better. But
this might be worth testing. I usually add star anise, black pepper
(often omitted, idk why), cumin, Sichuan peppercorn, black
cardamom. Potentially also cinnamon, and sand ginger.</p>
<p>There’s also aromatics like garlic, ginger, scallions, orange peel,
etc. In Sohla’s crisp recipe, you fry a bunch of crispy shallots and
garlic chips before making the oil. That way the oil gets infused with
lots of shallot and garlic flavor. I do love that, but it is a <em>lot</em>
of work.</p>

<p>Should you season the chili oil? Most recipes do call for some salt,
which interestingly is not soluble in oil. I guess the salt ends up
sticking to the chilies and therefore seasoning that aspect. Some
recipes go as far as adding sugar, MSG, and other
MSG-alternatives. This is where the ontology of the chili oil
matters<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>: Are you making a condiment or an ingredient? In my view,
a condiment should be seasoned sufficiently that it has some sort of
inherent tastiness. You’d be willing to eat a spoonful of ketchup or a
spoonful of mayo, even if it’d be a little intense. An ingredient does
not have to fulfill that requirement. Nobody’s just eating a spoonful
of flour. So a chili oil that’s an ingredient will omit sugar and MSG
and taste a little bland. That’s fine if you’re adding it to a dish
like a cold poached chicken, where there will be other seasoning. A
chili oil that’s a condiment will taste balanced on its own.</p>
<p>I do think if you add seasoning, you should go all the way and add
sugar, salt and MSG. They balance each other out really nicely.</p>
<p>If you add seasoning, you could be veering into a chili sauce or a
chili crisp. <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/homemade-chiu-chow-sauce/">Chiu chow chili
sauce</a> is a great
example. For a lot of people, especially in the US, what they consider
chili oil is actually chili crisp, specifically Lao Gan Ma, the most
popular brand by far. Lao Gan Ma actually has
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douchi">douchi</a> or
fermented black beans. Note that these are fermented black <strong>soy</strong>
beans, not the black beans that we eat in the West. Personally I find
douchi a little too strong of a flavor. They’re intensely salty and
can overpower the rest of the ingredients.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the oil will stay a little bland
regardless because salt does not dissolve into oil. Interestingly
enough it appears that sugar does dissolve.</p>

<p>For the longest time I used a spice grinder to blitz up the
chilies. It was fast and simple. I never loved the texture I got
though. You’d end up going too fine too quickly. Plus it tended to
create a lot of inhalable dust which made the process pretty painful.</p>
<p>I’ve recently switched over to toasting the chilies in a tiny bit of
oil, then pounding them in a mortar and pestle. It’s definitely more
manual labor, but you end up with these beautiful large flakes that
have great texture. It’s also releases less dust into the air. You do
have to make sure all of the chilies are properly toasted. They should
be shiny, lightly puffed up, and brittle. Otherwise you end up with
these large chunks that are too flexible to be ground down and end up
mixed into the flakes.</p>
<p>If we’re getting really nerdy here (and hey, this is already pretty
nerdy), I’d wonder about the particle distribution of grinding chilies
and how that affects flavor extraction. As any coffee nerd can tell
you, a spice grinder is pretty awful for grinding coffee because it
produces a very uneven particle distribution. You can end up with what
are called fines and boulders, fines being tiny, dust-like pieces of
coffee that create bitterness in the cup, and boulders being large
chunks that create sourness or emptiness in the cup. A mortar and
pestle isn’t that much better. If anything you end up more
bimodal. The end result is a bunch of large flakes covered with very
fine chili dust. Likely due to the combination of pounding and
grinding motions in the mortar and pestle. The pounding breaks the
chilies into big chunks, and the grinding produces the fine powder.</p>
<p>Is there a way to get better particle distribution? You could in
theory sift the chilies. But often times the powder appears stuck to
the flakes a little bit.</p>

<p>So far we’ve mostly been talking about Chinese style chili oil,
specifically Sichuan style. But what about other chili oils? Salsa
macha is a very popular Mexican style. And you could argue that a
<a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/what-is-tadka-tarka-chaunk-chhonk-baghaar">tadka</a>
is essentially an ad-hoc chili oil made at the last second. Could you
make a batch of Indian chili oil in advance, say by infusing mustard
seeds, curry leaves, cumin and coriander in some ghee and substitute
it for a tadka? I bet you could.</p>
<p>As for more European flavors, ChefSteps does an interesting
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkeZb6tN-c">Thanksgiving flavored
oil</a>. I bet a Calabrian
chili oil would be incredible.</p>

<p>As you can see, there’s a lot of questions and ideas here. Therefore,
I’m gonna need to do some experiments! But first, we should think
about methodology and potential issues with the experiments. The most
important criterion for an experiment is
reproducibility. Unfortunately, that is rather hard with chili oil,
because the chilies are organic compounds with variable
spiciness. We’re also using manual grinding so grind size is not
easily controllable either. This means that while we can grind up a
batch of chilies, use them in two different oils, and compare, we
can’t necessarily compare these oils to oils from a separate
experiment. Of course we should still try to make the experiments as
reproducible as possible, so we should standardize the chili blend,
ratio, and so on.</p>
<p>It’s also important to make the base oil as neutral as possible. I
tried doing an experiment with caiziyou as the base oil, and its
nuttiness occluded any differences between the two chili oils.</p>
<p>Of course, like coffee, you can never get a fully reproducible
setup. Instead it’s probably best to make a bunch of oils, do some
experiments, then learn about the general variables and how they
affect the flavor. In coffee that’s grind size, temperature, time,
ratio, dose, brew style. Chili oil has likely similar variables.</p>
<p>Anyways, on to the potential experiments. Here are a few that I have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infuse chilies at different temperatures</li>
<li>Hot flash chilies at different temperatures</li>
<li>Adjust the ratio of chilies to oil</li>
<li>Add alcohol to extract more flavor</li>
<li>How much do the spices actually affect the flavor?</li>
<li>Sous vide chili oil</li>
<li>Mortar and pestle vs spice grinder</li>
<li>Add oil for a hot flash multiple times.</li>
<li>Does stirring matter?</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d love to hear if someone has other experiment ideas or other
thoughts about chili oil. Feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:nick@nicholasyang.com">nick@nicholasyang.com</a>!</p>
