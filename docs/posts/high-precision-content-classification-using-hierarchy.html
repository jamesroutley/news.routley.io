    <h1>High-Precision Content Classification Using Hierarchy</h1>

<p>Content classification is the most fundamental form of holistic content understanding. It helps make
your resources findable (<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/F2">F2</a>) and connects them to other
resources (<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/I3">I3</a>).</p>
<p>Content understanding represents each piece of content in the index. Relevance of content is a
function of query and content understanding. Query understanding represents each search query as a
search intent.</p>
<p>Classification maps a document to one or more predefined categories. We can do so using hand-tuned
rules or machine learning.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The categories can be a flat list, or they can be arranged in a
hierarchical (single-hierarchy or faceted) taxonomy<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If the categories are hierarchical and broadly applicable
(<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/I1">I1</a>), then a classifier might take advantage of the
hierarchy and more confidently map content to a non-leaf category (e.g., mapping a material to
“Semiconductor” rather than “High-Gap Semiconductor” or “III-V Semiconductor”). In general, it’s
best to map value objects and entities to leaf categories.</p>
<p>Reducing the number of labels substantially improves the precision of a classifier. But filtering
out infrequent labels decreases coverage, and it’s not clear that out-of-scope examples will be
recognized in production.(<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/F4">F4</a>) A more robust approach is
to leverage the hierarchical nature of a taxonomy and roll up infrequently used labels to their
parent or other ancestor categories.</p>
