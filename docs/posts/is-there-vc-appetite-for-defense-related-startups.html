    <h1>Ask HN: Is there VC appetite for defense related startups?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I was wondering if there is VC appetite for defense based tech companies.<p>We are in advanced talks (hence the throw away) with M&amp;A teams of various of the top defense contractors for our startup, but me as CTO can&#39;t help but wonder if a VC model for us going forward wouldn&#39;t also be a good fit. Traditionally VC&#39;s shied away from hardware and defense startups but with the funding round of Anduril perhaps this is changing.</p><p>Katherine Boyle of A16Z also had something to say about how VC investment and Defense in the past didn&#39;t make sense, but that things could be changing [1].</p><p>The second problem with VC&#39;s is it is notoriously difficult to get in contact with the correct person, thus the proposal below. Dang let me know if this is not allowed please.</p><p>If there are any VC&#39;s perhaps interested you can contact me here</p><p>throwawaydefence at gmail dot com</p><p>and I can send you our prospectus / NDA agreement.</p><p>[1] - https://www.defensenews.com/smr/cultural-clash/2020/01/30/the-math-doesnt-make-sense-why-venture-capital-firms-are-wary-of-defense-focused-investments/</p><p>Edit - To address some of the comments below, this is a well established team (~50), with a proven track record, many years in the industry and a well developed sales pipeline, relationships and technology base.</p><p>So not just an idea or proposal thing, startup was maybe the wrong characterization but since this is HN...</p><p>The deal is (I believe) well above the typical SBIR grants threshold.</p></div></div>
