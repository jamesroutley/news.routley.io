It is a terrible format for tutorials or any guidance material that intends to teach people how to code, specifically beginners.</p><p>Why? Because none of these chapters answer the most important question a reader has, the entire time, WHY!? Why is all this important and what problems does it solve? When should I use this thing that I learned? Imagine if aliens landed on earth and we teach them everything about the shape of a fork, its material, how its made, typical ways of holding it, various shapes of forks, its history, and etymology, but never tell them that a fork is used to pick up food and stick it in the mouth.</p><p>Teaching how to code should be about problem-solving and effectively using the tools of a programming language to solve it. Say for example modeling a card game. Even better if the example is a continuous improvement starting from the very basics, hard coding stuff, and then increasing the scope as follows:</p><ul><li>Chapter 1: Cards (Constants, literals - hard code all cards)</li><li>Chapter 2: Suits (String concatenation, Int vs literal string)</li><li>Chapter 3: Ordered Ranks (Arrays, Variables to store each suit)</li><li>Chapter 4: Deck (Multidimensional arrays)</li><li>Chapter 5: Shuffling (Loops, Control flow, Member access, Assignment)</li><li>Chapter 6: Reusability of Shuffling algorithm (Functions, Pass by Value/Reference)</li><li>Chapter 7: Modeling a card game (I/O, Cards as Objects, Classes/Structs)</li><li>Chapter 8: Modeling a complex card game (Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphic behavior, Overriding methods, etc.)</li><li>Chapter 9: Multiplayer card game (Sockets and Networking, Server-Client communication, Concurrency)</li></ul><p>There are very few resources out there that truly embrace this type of teaching â€“ e.g. the absolutely brilliant <a href="https://natureofcode.com/">Nature of Code</a> for beginners. Another one for experienced software engineers is <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/architecture-patterns-with/9781492052197/">Architecture Patterns with Python</a> (models an e-commerce business from scratch).</p><p>I&#39;ve found that modeling or simulating something real like a card game is very effective. It teaches students about how to translate a real-world situation/problem/thing/phenomenon into code. Teaches them about assumptions and limitations of the model they&#39;ve built. Also, it teaches them about how to interrogate requirements imposed by the real world through simplification/abstraction or simply rejecting some aspects of it as &#34;Too complex, costly and impractical to model with no real benefit or a clear use case&#34; :-).</p><hr/><p>Image credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Croneberg_and_Stokoe.png">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Croneberg_and_Stokoe.png</a> Deafhistory101, CC BY-SA 4.0 <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</p>
