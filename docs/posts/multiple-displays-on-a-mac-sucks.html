    <h1>Multiple Displays on a Mac Sucks</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			

<p>So many people I’ve worked with have used multiple displays – typically a matched pair side-by-side – and sworn by them. It’s always mystified me, to be honest.</p>



<p>I’ve attempted the multi-display lifestyle a few times over the last thirty years. At first as a bourgeois indulgence, back when even having a single 17″ display was considered luxurious<sup data-fn="f3ad31a4-54b3-4c05-9f1f-e3057f4f8a73"><a href="#f3ad31a4-54b3-4c05-9f1f-e3057f4f8a73" id="f3ad31a4-54b3-4c05-9f1f-e3057f4f8a73-link">1</a></sup>, let-alone two displays. Just because I could. Then sporadically over the years in more practical attempts to expand my screen real estate.</p>



<p>The debut of 5k displays in 2014 relieved that pressure for a long while. It’s hard to overstate how profound that first 5k iMac was.</p>



<p>But in the last year or so I’ve felt a bit cramped – particularly as I’ve spent increasing amounts of time in Xcode, which is <em>okay</em> on a 5k display but not great. Especially if you try to do GUI design, whether AppKit or SwiftUI. Let-alone if you start working with iPad Pro simulators and the like.</p>



<p>So I’ve been considering, yet again, my options.</p>



<p>Sadly:</p>



<ol>
<li>I have an iMac Pro. Even if I were willing to waste the built-in display, I cannot – Apple does not allow iMacs to disable their internal displays.</li>



<li>There aren’t any great options for larger displays.</li>
</ol>



<p>As it happened, I had an extra 5k display left over from working at LinkedIn (they wouldn’t provide decent displays to employees while I was there, so I had to buy my own out of my own pocket<sup data-fn="3f8979d6-ea6a-4991-afc8-845186aeb8a5"><a href="#3f8979d6-ea6a-4991-afc8-845186aeb8a5" id="3f8979d6-ea6a-4991-afc8-845186aeb8a5-link">6</a></sup>). So far as multi-display setups go it’s arguably ideal, since it’s basically the exact same panel as the iMac Pro’s display, so it should match quite well<sup data-fn="9cf23db5-75b6-40a4-88cd-48d1ad743001"><a href="#9cf23db5-75b6-40a4-88cd-48d1ad743001" id="9cf23db5-75b6-40a4-88cd-48d1ad743001-link">7</a></sup>. So a few months ago I went to some effort to rearrange my working space to accomodate it, and set to work with it.</p>



<p>And not a lot has changed in thirty years.</p>



<h2><span id="The_Mac_operating_system_still_Just_Fucking_Sucks_at_remembering_where_windows_were_when_relaunching_apps">The Mac operating system <em>still</em> Just. Fucking. Sucks. at remembering where windows were, when relaunching apps.</span></h2>



<p>For the first month or so it was mostly fine – a couple of apps would be <em>occasionally</em> problematic, but it was tolerable. Mostly. Xcode in particularly pisses me off in that it <em>always</em> forgets where the documentation window was, every time you open it<sup data-fn="08475590-6d49-4fed-ab6b-99455053ae2a"><a href="#08475590-6d49-4fed-ab6b-99455053ae2a" id="08475590-6d49-4fed-ab6b-99455053ae2a-link">8</a></sup>.</p>



<p>But then, something invisible to me apparently happened, and since then <em>every single boot every single window resets its position onto the built-in display</em>. Every single boot I have to spend a bunch of time digging buried windows out from the over-crowded main display and shifting them back to their correct positions on the second display.</p>



<p>I might dismiss this as particular bad luck, except I know from decades of experience that this is in fact normal.  It <em>always</em> happens, sooner or later.  And at some point it will unfuck itself and start [mostly] remembering where windows go.  Only to inevitably repeat the vicious cycle.</p>



<h2><span id="Full-screen_apps_mostly_games_don8217t_handle_the_additional_displays_correctly">Full-screen apps (mostly games) don’t handle the additional display(s) correctly.</span></h2>



<p>i.e. they ignore them, typically. It’s very distracting having a bright display right next to one on which you’re trying to play a game. Every time I launch or exit such an app I have to manually open System Settings, go to Display settings, click the secondary display, and manually changes its brightness.</p>



<p>My secondary display (<a href="https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27md5kl-b-5k-uhd-led-monitor" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">LG 5k</a>) doesn’t have a power button, and I found out real quick that unplugging the Thunderbolt cable confuses the hell out of macOS, resulting in windows going wild and some apps outright crashing.</p>



<h2><span id="Side_Docks_aren8217t_practical">Side Docks aren’t practical.</span></h2>



<p>When the Dock is on the side, it only appears on the display that is farthest to that side.  Having to move the mouse across <em>multiple</em> displays just to get to the Dock is untenably slow and awkward.</p>



<p>I have the Dock set to auto-hide, because I’m not a monster.  But that does mean I have to be careful about mouse movements near its edge of the screen.</p>



<p>I prefer having the Dock on the left-hand side because it’s the least intrusive place – there’s relatively little you have to mouse to or interact with on the left edge (the right side is second-best, but notably is the home of scrollbars).  It’s also slightly easier to mouse left (or right) than down, because moving the mouse ‘down’ (towards me) has extra tension from the USB cable.</p>



<p>With multiple monitors (in a typical horizontal arrangement), I’m forced to use a bottom Dock, which is the worst place to have the Dock because so much stuff is placed right at the bottom of the screen – window resize widgets, toolbars &amp; their buttons, horizontal scrollbars, etc.  It’s immensely irritating to have to finesse minute mouse movements in order to avoid triggering the Dock while somehow still getting the cursor within a few pixels of the edge of the screen.  Sometimes it’s necessary to move the entire window just to interact with its bottom parts – which can in turn require first resizing it from the top, in order to allow it to be moved upwards.</p>



<h2></h2>



<p>I have the menu bar set to auto-hide, partly for reasons of visual cleanliness and to save a little screen space, but also because the menubar ruined my previous iMac’s display by burning in, hard.</p>



<p>I also use the menubar a lot more than for just activating menus with the mouse – I have iStat Menus and a host of other monitoring utilities in there as well.  So I’m frequently mousing up to the top of the screen to reveal the menubar.  Which is not a burden in itself – flicking the mouse to the top of the screen is a completely trivial operation.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t work half the time, when you have multiple displays, because the menubar will only deign to reveal itself on the “active” display, which is often at a glance visually indistinguishable from the “inactive” display (thanks to Apple’s long-running war against clarity).</p>



<p>That defeats the instinct and muscle-memory to just flick the cursor to the top of the display in order to see the menubar.  Worse, since macOS has some design flaws regarding menu bar reveal (e.g. it refuses to reveal if the frontmost application’s main thread runloop isn’t idle, and whenever an application is launching), you can’t immediately tell if it’s refusing to reveal itself because the cursor’s on the “wrong” display.  So inevitably there’s wasted, distracting moments of pause and investigation, and possibly movement to a whole different display.  For an operation that happens hundreds of times a day, wasted seconds add up.</p>



<h2><span id="Windows_appear_on_the_wrong_display_sometimes">Windows appear on the wrong display sometimes.</span></h2>



<p>Enough said, really.  I have no idea why they appear in the wrong places, but then so much about macOS’s window management is inexplicably buggy like this, such as why some modal dialogs appear <em>behind</em> all existing windows.</p>



<h2><span id="Multi-display_ergonomics_tend_to_suck">Multi-display ergonomics tend to suck.</span></h2>



<p>If – in a typical horizontal arrangement – you give the two displays equal priority in placement, you end up with one to your left and one to your right, with a very irritating gap between them in the one place it’s natural to look – straight ahead of you.  Neither display is aligned with the keyboard or mouse, which I find impairs typing and mousing accuracy (especially with a treadmill desk where I’m constantly moving).  And I find I get a sore neck no matter what, because I’m spending all my time looking anywhere but centre.</p>



<p>If you keep a “primary” display front and centre, and put a second one off to a side, the second display becomes <em>much</em> less useful because it’s even more uncomfortable to actually look at.  Which couples with the fact that…</p>



<h2><span id="Splitting_work_across_multiple_displays_is_hard">Splitting work across multiple displays is <em>hard</em>.</span></h2>



<p>More so than it seems it should be. But in practice there’s a <em>big</em> difference between two windows side-by-side on one display, and two windows on separate displays (<em>especially</em> if the displays aren’t identical, or aren’t aligned on horizontal or vertical axes). Maybe it’s as a simple as the difference between moving your eyes and moving your head.</p>



<p>Whatever it is, I just cannot get comfortable moving between displays frequently. That then forces me to not put anything <em>important</em> on the second display (especially if it has an ergonomically inferior position compared to the primary display), so it ends up being kind of a dumping ground for stuff I don’t actually use that often – e.g. calendar, clipboard viewers, calculators, etc.</p>



<p>And since I don’t actually use them that often, there’s really not much advantage to having them on a second display, versus just bringing them to the front on the main display and then hiding them again when I’m done. In fact, sometimes it’s counter-productive as irrelevant animations on the second display distract me, whereas they’d be safely out of sight behind other windows on the main display.</p>



<p>The only meaningful use-case I have so far for genuine simultaneous use is moving information references – e.g. Xcode’s documentation window – to the second display. In fact that was the specific use-case that made me go to the trouble of hooking up the second display, since it’s practically impossible to fit a non-trivial Xcode project into just half a 5k display, and having to constantly toggle between code &amp; documentation is irritating and a little disruptive – there’s often a <em>lot</em> of rapid back-and-forth between code &amp; docs, which is of course much easier if they’re simultaneously visible.</p>
