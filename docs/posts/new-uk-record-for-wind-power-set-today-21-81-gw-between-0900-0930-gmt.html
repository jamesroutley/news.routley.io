            <dt>Price  <span data-help="&lt;p&gt;As a market-traded commodity, electricity doesn’t have just one price: buyers and sellers can enter into contracts hours, days, weeks, or months in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These contracts can’t guarantee the system will be balanced — with generation and imports matching demand and exports — as generators may suffer unexpected outages and demand can’t be perfectly predicted in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price shown on this site is the balancing price, which is set every half an hour in order to balance the system. Higher prices encourage additional generation and discourage consumption, while lower prices have the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The balancing price can be zero or even negative. Many forms of renewable power generation are subsidised through the &lt;a href=&#39;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contracts-for-difference/contract-for-difference&#39;&gt;Contracts For Difference scheme&lt;/a&gt;, and can continue to profitably generate power until the price falls far enough below zero.&lt;/p&gt;"></span></dt>

            <dt>Generation <span data-help="&lt;p&gt;Most electrical power used in Great Britain is generated by power stations located around the country. These power stations use three types of fuel:&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fossil fuels are the remains of ancient plants and animals. Burning these to produce power causes carbon dioxide and other pollutants to be emitted, worsening the climate crisis and damaging human health.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renewables are resources that are rapidly replenished naturally. Replacing fossil fuels with renewables dramatically reduces carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other sources are those that may be preferable to fossil fuels but have unwanted effects of their own, such as the creation of radioactive waste or the destruction of old-growth forests.&lt;/p&gt;"></span></dt>

            <dt>Transfers <span data-help="&lt;p&gt;Generation does not need to match demand exactly, as energy can be transferred to and from other countries and into and out of energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cables known as interconnectors link the National Grid to the electric power transmission networks of neighbouring countries, transferring energy from countries with lower electricity prices to those with higher electricity prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy storage systems store energy when electricity prices are lower and release it when prices are higher. Historically, pumped storage systems have been the main form of energy storage, but battery storage systems have become increasingly common as costs have fallen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operators of interconnectors and energy storage systems earn a profit from the difference in electricity prices between countries or over time, while increasing the resilience of energy supply and helping to stabilise prices as demand and generation fluctuate.&lt;/p&gt;"></span></dt>
