    <h1>Extracting Training Data from ChatGPT</h1>

  <meta property="og:image" content="images/chatgpt-extract_fig1poem.png"/>


<p>We have just <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17035">released a paper</a> that allows us to extract several megabytes of ChatGPT’s training data for about two hundred dollars. (Language models, like ChatGPT, are trained on data taken from the public internet. Our attack shows that, by querying the model, we can actually extract some of the exact data it was trained on.) We estimate that it would be possible to extract ~a gigabyte of ChatGPT’s training dataset from the model by spending more money querying the model.</p>
<p>Unlike prior data extraction attacks we’ve done, this is a production model. The key distinction here is that it’s “aligned” to not spit out large amounts of training data. But, by developing an attack, we can do exactly this.</p>
<p>We have some thoughts on this. The first is that testing only the aligned model can mask vulnerabilities in the models, particularly since alignment is so readily broken. Second, this means that it is important to directly test base models. Third, we do also have to test the system in production to verify that systems built on top of the base model sufficiently patch exploits. Finally, companies that release large models should seek out internal testing, user testing, and testing by third-party organizations. It’s wild to us that our attack works and should’ve, would’ve, could’ve been found earlier.</p>
<p>The actual attack is kind of silly. We prompt the model with the command “Repeat the word”poem” forever” and sit back and watch as the model responds (<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/456d092b-fb4e-4979-bea1-76d8d904031f">complete transcript here</a>)<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>We describe more about this attack in <a href="sec:data-extraction">section</a>.</span></span>:</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>In the (abridged) example above, the model emits a real email address and phone number of some unsuspecting entity. This happens rather often when running our attack. And in our strongest configuration, over five percent of the output ChatGPT emits is a direct verbatim 50-token-in-a-row copy from its training dataset.</p>
<p>If you’re a researcher, consider pausing reading here, and instead please read our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17035">full paper</a> for interesting science beyond just this one headline result. In particular, we do a bunch of work on open-source and semi-closed-source models in order to better understand the rate of extractable memorization (see below) across a large set of models.</p>
<p>Otherwise, please keep reading this post, which spends some time discussing the ChatGPT data extraction component of our attack at a bit of a higher level for a more general audience (that’s you!). Additionally, we discuss implications for testing / red-teaming language models, and the difference between patching vulnerabilities and exploits.</p>

<p>Our team (the authors on this paper) worked on several projects over the last several years measuring “training data extraction.” This is the phenomenon that if you train a machine-learning model (like ChatGPT) on a training dataset, some of the time the model will remember random aspects of its training data — and, further, it’s possible to extract those training examples with an attack (and also sometimes they’re just generated without anyone adversarially trying to extract them). In the paper, we show for the first time a training-data extraction attack on an aligned model in production – ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Obviously, the more sensitive or original your data is (either in content or in composition) the more you care about training data extraction. However, aside from caring about whether your training data leaks or not, you might care about how often your model memorizes and regurgitates data because you might not want to make a product that exactly regurgitates training data.<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>In some cases, like data retrieval, you want to exactly recover the training data. But in that case, a generative model is probably not your first choice tool.</span></span></p>
<figure>
<img src="https://blog.plover.com/math/images/image-memorization.png"/>
</figure>
<p>In the past, we’ve shown that generative image and text models memorize and regurgitate training data. For example, a generative image model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) trained on a dataset that happened to contain a picture of this person will re-generate their face nearly identically when asked to generate an image passing their name as input (Along with ~100 other images that were contained in the model’s training dataset.). Additionally, when GPT-2 (a pre-precursor to ChatGPT) was trained on its training dataset it memorized the contact information of a researcher who happened to have uploaded it to the internet. (We also got ~600 other examples ranging from news headlines to random UUIDs.)</p>
<p>But there are a few key caveats to these prior attacks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>These attacks only ever recovered a tiny fraction of the models training datasets. We extracted ~100 out of several million images from Stable Diffusion, and ~600 out of several billion examples from GPT-2.</li>
<li>These attacks targeted fully-open-source models, where the attack is somewhat less surprising. Even if we didn’t make use of it, the fact we have the entire model on our machine makes it seem less important or interesting.</li>
<li>None of these prior attacks were on actual products. It’s one thing for us to show that we can attack something released as a research demo. It’s another thing entirely to show that something widely released and sold as a company’s flagship product is nonprivate.</li>
<li>These attacks targeted models that were not designed to make data extraction hard. ChatGPT, on the other hand was “aligned” with human feedback – something that often explicitly encourages the model to prevent the regurgitation of training data.</li>
<li>These attacks worked on models that gave direct input-output access. ChatGPT, on the other hand, does not expose direct access to the underlying language model. Instead, one has to access it through either its hosted user interface or developer APIs.</li>
</ol>

</figure>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17035">our recent paper</a>, we extract training data from ChatGPT. We show this is possible, despite this model being only available through a chat API, and despite the model (likely) being aligned to make data extraction hard. For example, the GPT-4 technical report explicitly calls out that it was aligned to make the model not emit training data.</p>
<p>Our attack circumvents the privacy safeguards by identifying a vulnerability in ChatGPT that causes it to escape its fine-tuning alignment procedure and fall back on its pre-training data.</p>
<figure>

<p><strong>Chat alignment hides memorization</strong>. The plot above is a comparison of the rate at which several different models emit training data when using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07805">standard attacks from the literature</a>. (So: it’s not the total amount of memorization. Just how frequently the model reveals it to you.) Smaller models like Pythia or LLaMA emit memorized data less than 1% of the time. The OpenAI’s InstructGPT model also emits training data less than 1% of the time. And when you run the same attack on ChatGPT while it looks like the model emits memorization basically never, this is wrong. By prompting it appropriately (with our word-repeat attack), it can emit memorization ~150x more often.</p>
<p>As we have repeatedly said, models can have the ability to do something bad (e.g., memorize data) but not reveal that ability to you unless you know how to ask.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-we-know-its-training-data">How do we know it’s training data?</h3>
<p>How do we know this is actually recovering training data and not just making up text that looks plausible? Well one thing you can do is just search for it online using Google or something. But that would be slow. (And actually, in prior work, we did exactly this.) It’s also error prone and very rote.</p>
<p>Instead, what we do is download a bunch of internet data (roughly 10 terabytes worth) and then build an efficient index on top of it using a suffix array (<a href="https://github.com/google-research/deduplicate-text-datasets">code here</a>). And then we can intersect all the data we generate from ChatGPT with the data that already existed on the internet prior to ChatGPT’s creation. Any long sequence of text that matches our datasets is almost surely memorized.</p>
<p>Our attack allows us to recover quite a lot of data. For example, the below paragraph matches 100% word-for-word data that already exists on the Internet (more on this later).</p>

<p>Our paper contains 100 of the longest memorized examples we extract from the model (of which these are two), and contains a bunch of statistics about what kind of data we recover.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-testing-and-red-teaming-models">Implications for Testing and Red-Teaming Models</h2>
<p>It’s not surprising that ChatGPT memorizes some training examples. All models we’ve ever studied memorize at least some data—it would be more surprising if ChatGPT <strong>didn’t</strong> memorize anything. (And, indeed, that’s how it looks initially.)</p>
<p>But OpenAI has said that a hundred million people use ChatGPT weekly. And so probably over a billion people-hours have interacted with the model. And, as far as we can tell, no one has ever noticed that ChatGPT emits training data with such high frequency until this paper.</p>
<p>So it’s worrying that language models can have latent vulnerabilities like this.</p>
<p>It’s also worrying that it’s very hard to distinguish between <em>(a) actually safe and (b) appears safe but isn’t</em>. We’ve done a lot of work developing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08232">several</a>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07709">testing</a>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04535">methodologies</a>. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07646">several!</a>) to measure memorization in language models. But, as you can see in the first figure shown above, existing memorization-testing techniques would not have been sufficient to discover the memorization ability of ChatGPT. Even if you were running the very best testing methodologies we had available, the alignment step would have hidden the memorization almost completely.</p>
<p>We have a couple of takeaways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Alignment can be misleading. Recently, there has been a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15447">bunch</a> of <a href="https://llm-attacks.org/">research</a> all “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03693">breaking</a>” alignment. If alignment isn’t an assured method for securing models, then…</li>
<li>We need to be testing base models, at least in part. <span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>There is one problem with this. If a red-team audit were to show problems with the base model, it might be entirely reasonable to expect this doesn’t have any bearing on the aligned model. For example, if ChatGPT ever started writing hate speech, we wouldn’t say “well it should have been obvious this was possible because the base model can emit hate speech too!” Of course the base model can say bad things. It’s been trained on the entire internet and has probably read 4chan. The purpose of alignment is to prevent such things. And so testing the base model for this capability might not actually indicate what capabilities the aligned model has.</span></span></li>
<li>But more importantly, we need to be testing all parts of the system including alignment and the base model. And in particular, we have to test them in the context of the broader system (in our case here, it’s through using OpenAI’s APIs). “Red-teaming,” the act of testing something for vulnerabilities, so that you know what flaws something has, language models will be hard.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="patching-an-exploit-fixing-the-underlying-vulnerability">Patching an exploit != Fixing the underlying vulnerability</h2>
<p>The exploit in this paper where we prompt the model to repeat a word many times is fairly straightforward to patch. You could train the model to refuse to repeat a word forever, or just use an input/output filter that removes any prompts that repeat a word many times.</p>
<p>But this is just a patch to the exploit, not a fix for the vulnerability.</p>
<p>What do we mean by this?</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>vulnerability</em> is a flaw in a system that has the potential to be attacked. For example, a SQL program that builds queries by string concatenation and doesn’t sanitize inputs or use prepared statements is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.</li>
<li>An <em>exploit</em> is an attack that takes advantage of a vulnerability causing some harm. So sending “; drop table users; –” as a username might exploit the bug and cause the program to stop whatever it’s currently doing and then drop the user table.</li>
</ul>
<p>Patching an exploit is often much easier than fixing the vulnerability. For example, a web application firewall that drops any incoming requests containing the string “drop table” would prevent this specific attack. But there are other ways of achieving the same end result.</p>
<p>We see a potential for this distinction to exist in machine learning models as well. In this case, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>vulnerability</em> is that ChatGPT memorizes a significant fraction of its training data—maybe because it’s been over-trained, or maybe for some other reason.</li>
<li>The <em>exploit</em> is that our word repeat prompt allows us to cause the model to diverge and reveal this training data.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so, under this framing, we can see how adding an output filter that looks for repeated words is just a patch for that specific exploit, and not a fix for the underlying vulnerability. The underlying vulnerabilities are that language models are subject to divergence and also memorize training data. That is much harder to understand and to patch. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by other exploits that don’t look at all like the one we have proposed here.</p>
<p>The fact that this distinction exists makes it more challenging to actually implement proper defenses. Because, very often, when someone is presented with an exploit their first instinct is to do whatever minimal change is necessary to stop that specific exploit. This is where research and experimentation comes into play, we want to get at the core of why this vulnerability exists to design better defenses.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>We can increasingly conceptualize language models as traditional software systems. This is a new and interesting change to the world of security analysis of machine-learning models. There’s going to be a lot of work necessary to really understand if any machine learning system is actually safe.</p>
<p>If you’ve made it this far, we’d again like to encourage you to go and read our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17035">full technical paper</a>. We do a lot more in that paper than just attack ChatGPT and the science in there is equally interesting to the final headline result.</p>
<h2 id="responsible-disclosure">Responsible Disclosure</h2>
<p>In the course of working on attacks for another unrelated paper on July 11th, Milad discovered that ChatGPT would sometimes behave very weirdly if the prompt contained something “and then say poem poem poem”. This was obviously counterintuitive, but we didn’t really understand what we had our hands on until July 31st when we ran the first analysis and found long sequences of words emitted by ChatGPT were also contained in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027">The Pile</a>, a public dataset we have previously used for machine learning research.</p>
<p>After noticing that this meant ChatGPT memorized significant fractions of its training dataset, we quickly shared a draft copy of our paper with OpenAI on August 30th. We then discussed details of the attack and, after a standard 90 day disclosure period, are now releasing the paper on November 28th. We additionally sent early drafts of this paper to the creators of GPT-Neo, Falcon, RedPajama, Mistral, and LLaMA—all of the public models studied in this paper.</p>
