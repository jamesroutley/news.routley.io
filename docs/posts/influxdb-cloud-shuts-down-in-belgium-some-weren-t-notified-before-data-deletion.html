              <p>I’m using hosted InfluxDB on europe-west1. Now this weekend I’m see weird behaviour in my dashboard, missing or incomplete data or data that changes between refreshed… I see this behaviour on all dashboards.</p>
<p>I saw this on the InfluxDB status page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discontinuation of AWS ap-southeast-2 (Sydney) and GCP europe-west1 (Belgium)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Retention on all my buckets is: forever.</p>
<p>Could this be the cause? I hope I’m not losing my data… I did not get emails from InfluxDB about this change. Can anyone elaborate on this?</p>

              <p>Same here. All my buckets just got deleted.</p>
<p>I too have received NO email notification about this despite receiving other InfluxDB emails. This is a catastrophic communication breakdown, particularly since there were no brownouts in the lead up.</p>
<p>I guess we’ll see if InfluxData kept backups for this…</p>
<p>I have a Saturday night crisis meeting to enjoy shortly with my management.</p>

              <p>Yes but we were never <em>informed</em> about this. We have a running use case and are not in the habit of checking the documentation every week just in case our service gets cancelled without prior warning.</p>
<p>InfluxData should also have seen that instances in these regions still had read and write access and informed all affected customers.</p>
<p>This is highly unprofessional</p>

<p>According to the support, the notification emails to the users were sent on Feb 23, Apr 6 and May 15th. However, we did not receive those at all.</p>
<p>The support also mentioned that restoring data from Belgium now is impossible as the region has been discontinued.</p>
<p>I would say the service quality is a bit dodgy… We are considering other alternative solutions now.</p>

              <p>Hi all, I am ever so sorry the closure of these clusters has unexpectedly hit you. To confirm the information given by support. Communication was delivered in the following ways;</p>
<ol>
<li>The UI was updated with a closure message for these regions.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://status.influxdata.com/">https://status.influxdata.com/</a> website also provides the notification.</li>
<li>We sent out emails on the following dates:</li>
</ol>
<p>We understand that a scream test would have been another form of communication that we overlooked. Some of the reasons for the closure of been outlined here: <a href="https://influxcommunity.slack.com/archives/CH8TV3LJG/p1688623563430219">Slack</a></p>

              <p>Thanks, <a href="https://community.influxdata.com/u/jay_clifford">@Jay_Clifford</a>, but it seems that you your efforts were’nt enough.</p>
<ol>
<li>We do not connect on the UI on a regularly basis, as we use grafana to query the data. But I worked personally with the UI since February, and I didn’t see any message in the UI. If I noticed this message, I would have take action! Where and when was we supposed to see this message ?</li>
<li>We weren’t aware of this service “<a href="http://status.influxdata.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">status.influxdata.com</a>”, until we encountered problems this week-end;</li>
<li>We didn’t received any email from you on the days you mention. <strong>Absolutely any email</strong>. We performed a search on multiple mailboxes, including the one where we received your newsletter.</li>
</ol>
<p>I searched your blog: nothing about this discontinuation. I searched on the web: nothing, nor on your twitter account.</p>
<p>It’s the first time that I experience a closure without being noticed. After using the OSS version of influx, we use your service for peace-of-mind and professional service. Now, we are not peace-of-mind.</p>
<p>What shall you do to apologize and/or help us to recover our data ?</p>

              <p>Can 100% agree with <a href="https://community.influxdata.com/u/julienfastre">@Julienfastre</a>, we’ve checked every possible email on our side and there is absolutely no mention of the closure.</p>
<p>Influx Cloud, as a data-storage service and data-management service, needs to do a lot more than “understand” and be “ever so sorry”, you need to communicate clearly with customers, and actually store and manage the data responsibly and reliably.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your resolving of this issue.</p>

              <p>Yep, I just found out we’ve lost 10GB of customer data because we didn’t think to regularly check the UI nor status page for information.</p>
<p>Emails definitely <strong>not</strong> received, but I have received their latest invoice just a couple of days ago, along with plenty of marketing emails. Funny that.</p>

            <p>We have a similar experience; no notable communication via the UI, which we use almost daily, and no emails to emails connected to the organisation. How will influx solve this and migrate data? Data loss is not an acceptable option.</p>
