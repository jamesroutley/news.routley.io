              <p>I’m using hosted InfluxDB on europe-west1. Now this weekend I’m see weird behaviour in my dashboard, missing or incomplete data or data that changes between refreshed… I see this behaviour on all dashboards.</p>
<p>I saw this on the InfluxDB status page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discontinuation of AWS ap-southeast-2 (Sydney) and GCP europe-west1 (Belgium)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Retention on all my buckets is: forever.</p>
<p>Could this be the cause? I hope I’m not losing my data… I did not get emails from InfluxDB about this change. Can anyone elaborate on this?</p>

<p>You cannot just shut down a service without informing your customer via mail. What are solutions for us that do not involve data loss?</p>

              <p>Yes but we were never <em>informed</em> about this. We have a running use case and are not in the habit of checking the documentation every week just in case our service gets cancelled without prior warning.</p>
<p>InfluxData should also have seen that instances in these regions still had read and write access and informed all affected customers.</p>
<p>This is highly unprofessional</p>

              <p>Another victim here.</p>
<p>According to the support, the notification emails to the users were sent on Feb 23, Apr 6 and May 15th. However, we did not receive those at all.</p>
<p>The support also mentioned that restoring data from Belgium now is impossible as the region has been discontinued.</p>
<p>I would say the service quality is a bit dodgy… We are considering other alternative solutions now.</p>

              <p>Wow. We were considering InfluxDB and the cloud offering for a future workload. That’s off the table now.</p>
<p>Hope you guys don’t suffer from any data loss.</p>
