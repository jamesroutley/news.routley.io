<section>
<p>In the middle of August 2021, a special <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3bddb2e1a85a9e06b9f9021ad301fdcde33e197225ae1676b8c6d0b416193ecf/">Word document</a> was uploaded to VirusTotal by a user from Argentina. Although it was only detected by a single antivirus engine at the time, this sample turned out to be exploiting a zero day vulnerability in Microsoft Office to gain remote code execution.</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1408" height="462" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-1.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/image-1.png 1000w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-1.png 1408w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/></figure><p>Three weeks later, Microsoft published an <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-40444">advisory</a> after being notified of the exploit by researchers from Mandiant and EXPMON. It took Microsoft nearly a month from the time the exploit was first uploaded to VirusTotal to publish a patch for the zero day.</p><p>In this blog post, I will be sharing my in-depth analysis of the several vulnerabilities abused by the attackers, how the exploit was patched, and how to port the exploit for a generic Internet Explorer environment.</p><h2 id="first-look">First Look</h2><p>A day after Microsoft published their advisory, I saw a tweet from the malware collection group <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground">@vxunderground</a> offering a malicious payload for CVE-2021-40444 to blue/red teams.</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="742" height="252" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-2.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-2.png 742w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>I reached out to receive a copy, because why not? My curiosity has generally lead me in the right direction for my life and I was interested in seeing a Microsoft Word exploit that had been found in the wild.</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1224" height="238" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-3.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/image-3.png 1000w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-3.png 1224w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>With the payload in hand, one of the first steps I took was placing it into an isolated virtual machine with basic dynamic analysis tooling. Specifically, one of my favorite network monitoring utilities is <a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddler-classic">Fiddler</a>, a freemium tool that allows you to intercept web requests (including encrypted HTTPS traffic).</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1072" height="420" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-4.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/image-4.png 1000w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-4.png 1072w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>After I opened the malicious Word document, Fiddler immediately captured strange HTTP requests to the domain, &#34;hidusi[.]com&#34;. For some reason, the Word document was making a request to &#34;http://hidusi[.]com/e8c76295a5f9acb7/side.html&#34;.</p><p>At this point, the &#34;hidusi[.]com&#34; domain was already taken down. Fortunately, the &#34;side.html&#34; file being requested was included with the sample that was shared with me.</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1120" height="396" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-5.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/image-5.png 1000w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-5.png 1120w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Unfortunately, the HTML file was largely filled with obfuscated JavaScript. Although I could immediately decrypt this JavaScript and go from there, this is generally a bad idea to do at an early stage because we have no understanding of the exploit.</p><h2 id="reproduction">Reproduction</h2><p>Whenever I encounter a new vulnerability that I want to reverse engineer, my first goal is always to produce a minimal reproduction example of the exploit to ensure I have a working test environment and a basic understanding of how the exploit works. Having a reproduction case is critical to reverse engineering how the bug works, because it allows for dynamic analysis.</p><p>Since the original &#34;hidusi[.]com&#34; domain was down, we needed to host our version of side.html. Hosting a file is easy, but how do we make the Word document use our domain instead? It was time to find where the URL to side.html was hidden inside the Word document.</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="936" height="250" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-6.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-6.png 936w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Raw Bytes of &#34;A Letter before court 4.docx&#34;</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="626" height="123" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-7.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-7.png 626w"/><figcaption>Extracted Contents of &#34;A Letter before court 4.docx&#34;</figcaption></figure><p>Did you know that Office documents are just ZIP files? As we can see from the bytes of the malicious document, the first few bytes are simply the magic value in the ZIP header.</p><p>Once I extracted the document as a ZIP, finding the URL was relatively easy. I performed a string search across every file the document contained for the domain &#34;hidusi[.]com&#34;.</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-8.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="722" height="279" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-8.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-8.png 722w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Hidusi[.]com found under word/_rels/document.xml.rels</figcaption></figure><p>Sure enough, I found one match inside the file &#34;word/_rels/document.xml.rels&#34;.

In this case, a Google engineer publicly disclosed an exploit that they suspected malicious actors attributed to China had already discovered. Similar to this vulnerability, CVE-2021-0096 was only found to be used in &#34;very targeted&#34; attacks.</p><p>When I was researching implementations of exploits for CVE-2011-0096, I came across an <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16071">exploit-db release</a> that included an approach for abusing the vulnerability through a Word document. Specifically, in part #5 and #6 of the exploit, this author discovered that CVE-2011-0096 could be abused to launch executables on the local machine and read the contents of the local filesystem. The interesting part here is that this 2011 vulnerability involved abusing the MHTML URL protocol and that it allowed for remote code execution via a Word document, similar to the case with CVE-2021-4044. </p><h3 id="reproduction-what-about-the-x-usc-in-the-target">Reproduction: What about the &#34;X-USC&#34; in the Target?</h3><p>Going back to our strange Target attribute, what is the &#34;!x-usc:&#34; portion for?</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-14.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1324" height="506" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-14.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/image-14.png 1000w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-14.png 1324w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/></figure><p>I found <a href="mhtml:http://google.com/whatever!x-usc:http://bing.com">a blog post from 2018</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/insertScript">@insertScript</a> which discovered that the x-usc directive was used to reference an external link. In fact, the example URL given by the author still works on the latest version of Internet Explorer (IE). If you enter &#34;mhtml:http://google.com/whatever!x-usc:http://bing.com&#34; into your IE URL bar while monitoring network requests, there will be both a request to Google and Bing, due to the &#34;x-usc&#34; directive.</p><p>In the context of CVE-2021-40444, I was unable to discover a definitive answer for why the same URL was repeated after an &#34;x-usc&#34; directive. As we&#39;ll see in upcoming sections, the JavaScript in side.html is executed regardless of whether or not the attribute contains the &#34;x-usc&#34; suffix. It is possible that due to some potential race conditions, this suffix was added to execute the exploit twice to ensure successful payload delivery.</p><h3 id="reproduction-attempting-to-create-my-own-payload">Reproduction: Attempting to Create my Own Payload</h3><p>Now that we know how the remote side.html page is triggered by the Word document, it was time to try and create our own. Although we could proceed by hosting the same side.html payload the attackers used in their exploit, it is important to produce a minimal reproduction example first.</p><p>Instead of hosting the second-stage side.html payload, I opted to write a barebone HTML page that would indicate JavaScript execution was successful. This way, we can understand how JavaScript is executed by the Word document before reverse engineering what the attacker&#39;s JavaScript does.</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-15.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="874" height="368" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-15.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-15.png 874w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Test Payload to Prove JS Execution</figcaption></figure><p>In the example above, I created an HTML page that simply made an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a> to a non-existent domain. If the JavaScript is executed, we should be able to see a request to &#34;icanseethisrequestonthenetwork.com&#34; inside of Fiddler.</p><p>Before testing in the actual Word document, I verified as a sanity check that this page does make the web request inside of Internet Explorer. Although the code may seem simple enough to where it would &#34;obviously work&#34;, performing simple sanity checks like these on fundamental assumptions you make can greatly save you time debugging future issues. For example, if you don&#39;t verify a fundamental assumption and continue with reverse engineering, you could spend hours debugging the wrong issue when in fact you were missing a basic mistake.</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-16.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1668" height="97" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-16.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/image-16.png 1000w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w1600/2021/11/image-16.png 1600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-16.png 1668w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/><figcaption>Modified Relationship with Barebone Payload</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-17.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="774" height="349" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-17.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-17.png 774w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Network Requests After Executing Modified Document</figcaption></figure><p>Once I patched the original Word document with my modified relationship XML, I launched it inside my VM with the Fiddler proxy running. I was seeing requests to the send_request.html payload! But... there were no requests to &#34;icanseethisonthenetwork.com&#34;. We have demonstrated a flaw in our fundamental assumption that whatever HTML page we point the MHTML protocol towards will be executed.</p><p>How do you debug an issue like this? One approach would be to go in blind and try to reverse engineer the internals of the HTML engine to see why JavaScript wasn&#39;t being executed. The reason this is not a great idea is because often these codebases can be <em>massive</em>, and it would be like finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>What can we do instead? Create a minimally viable reproduction case where the JavaScript of the HTML <em>is</em> executed. We know that the attacker&#39;s payload must have worked in their attack. What if instead of writing our own payload first, we tried to host their payload instead?</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-24.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="778" height="374" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-24.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-24.png 778w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Network Requests After Executing with Side.html Payload</figcaption></figure><p>I uploaded the attacker’s original &#34;side.html&#34; payload to my server and replaced the relationship in the Word document with that URL. When I executed this modified document in my VM, I saw something extremely promising- requests for &#34;ministry.cab&#34;. This means that the attacker&#39;s JavaScript inside side.html was executed!</p><p>We have an MVP payload that gets executed by the Word document, now what? Although we could ignore our earlier problem with our own payload and try to figure out what the CAB file is used for directly, we&#39;d be skipping a crucial step of the exploit. We want to <em>understand</em> CVE-2021-40444, not just reproduce it.</p><p>With this MVP, we can now try to debug and reverse engineer the question, &#34;Why does the working payload result in JavaScript execution, but not our own sample?&#34;.</p><h3 id="reproduction-reverse-engineering-microsoft%E2%80%99s-html-engine">Reproduction: Reverse Engineering Microsoft’s HTML Engine</h3><p>The primary module responsible for processing HTML in Windows is MSHTML.DLL, the &#34;Microsoft HTML Viewer&#34;. This binary alone is 22 MB, because it contains almost everything from rendering HTML to executing JavaScript. For example, Microsoft has their own JavaScript engine in this binary used in Internet Explorer (and Word).</p><p>Given this massive size, blindly reversing is a terrible approach. What I like to do instead is use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon">ProcMon</a> to trace the execution of the successful (document with side.html) and failing payload (document with barebone HTML), then compare their results.

This causes control.exe to start rundll32.exe, passing the INF file as the Control Panel Item to execute.</p><p>The fully deobfuscated and commented HTML/JS payload can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/D4stiny/1692ded337b67bfbeea10f2269af81fe">here</a>.</p><h2 id="overview-of-the-attack">Overview of the Attack</h2><p>We covered a significant amount in the previous sections, let&#39;s summarize the attack from start to finish:</p><ol><li>A victim opens the malicious Word document.</li><li>Word loads the attacker&#39;s HTML page as an OLE object and executes the contained JavaScript.</li><li>An IFrame is created and destroyed, but a reference to its ActiveX scripting surface remains.</li><li>The CAB file is invoked by creating an ActiveX control for it.</li><li>While the CAB file&#39;s signature is verified, the contained INF file is written to the user&#39;s Temp directory.</li><li>Finally, the INF is invoked by using the &#34;.cpl&#34; extension as a URL protocol, using relative path escapes to reach the temporary directory.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2022/01/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="544" height="528"/></figure><h2 id="reversing-microsofts-patch">Reversing Microsoft&#39;s Patch</h2><p>When Microsoft released its advisory for this bug on September 7th, they had no patch! To save face, they claimed Windows Defender was a mitigation, but that was just a detection for the attacker&#39;s exploit. The underlying vulnerability was untouched.</p><p>It took them nearly a month from when the first known sample was uploaded to VirusTotal (August 19th) to finally fix the issue on September 14th with a Patch Tuesday update. Let’s take a look at the major changes in this patch.</p><p>A popular practice by security researchers is to find the differences in binaries that used to contain vulnerabilities with the patched binary equivalent. I updated my system but saved several DLL files from my unpatched machine. There are a couple of tools that are great for finding assembly-level differences between two similar binaries.</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.zynamics.com/bindiff.html">BinDiff</a> by Zynamics</li><li><a href="https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora">Diaphora</a> by Joxean Koret</li></ol><p>I went with Diaphora because it is more advanced than BinDiff and allows for easy pseudo-code level comparisons. The primary binaries I diff&#39;d were:</p><ol><li>IEFRAME.dll - This is what executed the URL protocol for &#34;.cpl&#34;.</li><li>URLMON.dll - This is what had the CAB file extraction exploit.</li></ol><h3 id="reversing-microsofts-patch-ieframe">Reversing Microsoft&#39;s Patch: IEFRAME</h3><p>Once I diff’d the updated and unpatched binary, I found ~1000 total differences, but only ~30 major changes. One function that had heavy changes and was associated with the CPL exploit was _AttemptShellExecuteForHlinkNavigate.</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-76.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="849" height="414" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-76.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-76.png 849w"/><figcaption>Pseudocode Diff of _AttemptShellExecuteForHlinkNavigate</figcaption></figure><p>In the old version of IEFRAME, this function simply used <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutew">ShellExecuteW</a> to open the URL protocol with no verification. This is why the CPL file extension was processed as a URL protocol.</p><p>In the new version, they added a significant number of checks for the URL protocol. Let’s compare the differences.</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-78.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1217" height="539" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-78.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/image-78.png 1000w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-78.png 1217w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Patched _AttemptShellExecuteForHlinkNavigate Pseudocode</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-79.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1188" height="564" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-79.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/image-79.png 1000w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-79.png 1188w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>New IsValidSchemeName Function</figcaption></figure><p>In the patched version of _AttemptShellExecuteForHlinkNavigate, the primary addition that prevents the use of file extensions as URL Protocols is the call to IsValidSchemeName.</p><p>This function takes the URL Protocol that is being used (i.e &#34;.cpl&#34;) and verifies that all characters in it are alphanumerical. For example, this exploit used the CPL file extension to trigger the INF file. With this patch, &#34;.cpl&#34; would fail the IsValidSchemeName function because it contains a period which is non-alphanumerical.</p><p>An important factor to note is that this patch for using file extensions as URL Protocols only applies to MSHTML. File extensions are still exposed for use in other attacks against ShellExecute, which is why I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we saw similar techniques in future vulnerabilities.</p><h3 id="reversing-microsofts-patch-urlmon">Reversing Microsoft&#39;s Patch: URLMON</h3><p>I performed the same patch diffing on URLMON and found a major change in catDirAndFile. This function was used during extraction to generate the output path for the INF file.</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2021/11/image-80.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="432" height="283"/><figcaption>Patched catDirAndFile Pseudocode</figcaption></figure><p>The patch for the CAB extraction exploit was extremely simple. All Microsoft did was replace any instance of a forward slash with a backslash. This prevents the INF extraction exploit of the CAB file because backslashes are ignored for relative path escapes.</p><h2 id="abusing-cve-2021-40444-in-internet-explorer">Abusing CVE-2021-40444 in Internet Explorer</h2><p>Although Microsoft&#39;s advisory covers an attack scenario where this vulnerability is abused in Microsoft Office, could we exploit this bug in another context?</p><p>Since Microsoft Office uses the same engine Internet Explorer uses to display web pages, could CVE-2021-40444 be abused to gain remote code execution from a malicious page opened in IE? When I tried to visit the same payload used in the Word document, the exploit did not work &#34;out of the box&#34;, specifically due to an error with the pop up blocker.</p><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2022/01/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="862" height="50" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/image-2.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2022/01/image-2.png 862w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>IE blocks .cpl popup</figcaption></figure><p>Although the CAB extraction exploit was successfully triggered, the attempt to launch the payload failed because Internet Explorer considered the &#34;.cpl&#34; exploit to be creating a pop up.</p><p>Fortunately, we can port the .cpl exploit to get around this pop up blocker relatively easily. Instead of creating a new page, we can simply redirect the current page to the &#34;.cpl&#34; URL.</p><pre><code>function redirect() {
    //
    // Redirect current window without creating new one,
    // evading the IE pop up blocker.
    //
    window.location = &#34;.cpl:../../../AppData/Local/Temp/Low/msword.inf&#34;;
    document.getElementById(&#34;status&#34;).innerHTML = &#34;Done&#34;;
}

//
// Trigger in 500ms to give time for the .cab file to extract.
//
setTimeout(function() {
    redirect()
}, 500);</code></pre><figure><img src="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2022/01/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1062" height="591" srcset="https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/image-3.png 600w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/image-3.png 1000w, https://billdemirkapi.me/content/images/2022/01/image-3.png 1062w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>With the small addition of the redirect, CVE-2021-40444 works without issue in Internet Explorer. The complete code for this ported HTML/JS payload can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/D4stiny/4fd437bad4233856a7cebd42fb3057e5">here</a>.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>CVE-2021-40444 is in fact compromised of several vulnerabilities as we investigated in this blog post. Not only was there the initial step of extracting a malicious file to a predictable location through the CAB file exploit, but there was also the fact that URL Protocols could be file extensions.</p><p>In the latest patch, Word still executes pages with JavaScript if you use the MHTML protocol. What’s frightening to me is that the entire attack surface of Internet Explorer is exposed to attackers through Microsoft Word. That is <em><strong>a lot</strong></em> of legacy code. Time will tell what other vulnerabilities attacker&#39;s will abuse in Internet Explorer through Microsoft Office.</p>
