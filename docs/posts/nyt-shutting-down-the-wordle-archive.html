    <h1>NYT shutting down the Wordle archive</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"> 
<p>When Josh Wardle launched <strong><em>Wordle</em></strong> in late 2021, it would have been difficult to predict what a global phenomenon the simple word game would become. However, in seemingly no time, it took the internet by storm, and soon everyone was sharing their <em>Wordle</em> results on Twitter and challenging their friends to do better. In 2022, <a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/wordle/"><em>Wordle</em></a> caught the attention of The New York Times, and it decided to buy the game from Wardle for a sum in the low seven figures.</p>

<p>Since the acquisition, gamers have voiced concern over the future of <em>Wordle</em>. Many are worried that the game that was once free will become an exclusive game only available to The New York Times subscribers, and some fear that the corporatization of <em>Wordle</em> will disrupt the harmonious relationship the game has had with the various clones it has spawned. Some of these fears may have been proven correct because the <a href="https://gamerant.com/wordle-archive-shut-down-new-york-times/">Wordle Archive has been shut down</a> at the request of The New York Times.</p>

<p>The Wordle Archive is a fan-made service that allows users to <a href="https://gamerant.com/wordle-answer-february-16-caulk-meaning-frustration/">play past <em>Wordle</em> puzzles</a> and track their statistics. It is useful for players who might have missed <em>Wordle</em> on certain days, or for players who hopped on the trend late and would like to play the earlier puzzles. Unfortunately, anyone who tries to visit the site now will be met with a message informing them that, due to a request from The New York Times, the archive has been shut down. The message takes on a positive tone, however, and it thanks users for past support, and it encourages players to play<em> Wordle</em> on the official site.</p>

<p>This will be a disappointment to gamers wishing to access <em>Wordle</em>&#39;s backlog. Although there are several other fan-made <em>Wordle</em> archives, it is likely only a matter of time before they also receive requests from <a href="https://gamerant.com/wordle-fans-worried-new-york-times-acquisition-purchase/">The New York Times</a>. It is unclear whether The New York Times has any legal avenues to take down the archives, but any fan-made archives are going to have a hard time going up against a multimillion-dollar corporation.</p>

<p>The New York Times is a subscription-based news service. Hence, there have been concerns that The New York Times will eventually paywall <em>Wordle</em> behind its subscription service. Although that has yet to happen, it does seem like The New York Times is making a push towards increasing the game&#39;s exclusivity, and that could spell bad news for the various <a href="https://gamerant.com/wordle-success-variants-made-niche-interests-good/">clones that <em>Wordle</em> has spawned</a>.</p>
<!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! -->
 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: word count #3! --> 
<p>If The New York Times is requesting <em>Wordle</em> archives be shut down, <a href="https://gamerant.com/wordle-site-track-wordle-clones/">the <em>Wordle</em> clones could be next</a>. This includes games that put a unique twist on <em>Wordle</em>, including <em>Lewdle</em> which uses lewd words, <em>Taylordle</em> which features Taylor Swift-themed words, and <em>Star Wordle</em> which makes use of <em>Star Wars</em>-themed words. Without these clones around, players may find themselves restricted to one <em>Wordle</em> puzzle a day yet again.</p>
<p>Making <a href="https://gamerant.com/new-york-times-wordle-purchase-odd-fitting-2022-theme/"><em>Wordle</em> exclusive aligns with The New York Times</a>&#39; goals. The newspaper intends to increase its subscriber count to 10 million by 2025, and its focus on word games is part of its strategy. <em>Wordle</em> joins The New York Times&#39; suite of word games which include <em>Spelling Bee</em> and <em>Letter Boxed</em>. The newspaper also offers number-based games such as <em>Sudoku</em>.</p>

<p>Although <em>Wordle</em>&#39;s increasing exclusivity might benefit The New York Times, it will not sit well with many gamers who prefer the game to remain as free and as widely available as possible. It also has the potential to destroy the community of <em>Wordle</em> archives and <a href="https://gamerant.com/lewdle-wordle-clone-inappropriate-words-phrases-spin-off/">clones that have formed around <em>Wordle</em></a> and brought gamers around the world together.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wordle</em></strong> is available now in any browser.</p>
