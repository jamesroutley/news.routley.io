          <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Multiplexing"><em>OpenSSH</em> (the book) says this about SSH multiplexing:</a>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Multiplexing is the ability to send more than one signal over a
            single line or connection. In OpenSSH, multiplexing can re-use an
            existing outgoing TCP connection for multiple concurrent SSH
            sessions to a remote SSH server, avoiding the overhead of creating a
            new TCP connection and reauthenticating each time.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          For example, maybe you want to use the Docker CLI on
          <code>jump-host.example.org</code>, against a Docker daemon on
          <code>docker-host.example.org</code>. You follow
          <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/protect-access/#ssh-tips">the Docker docs&#39; suggestion</a>
          for setting up Docker over SSH, including multiplexing:
        </p>
        <pre><code>Host docker-host.example.org
  ControlMaster     auto
  ControlPath       ~/.ssh/control-%C
  ControlPersist    yes
</code></pre>
        <p>
          After using this setup for a while, you notice that SSHing into
          <code>docker-host</code> fails occasionally with an error message like
          &#34;Session open refused by peer&#34;. You Google and discover that, by
          default, OpenSSH has a limit of 10 multiplexed sessions per TCP
          connection. Beyond that, <code>sshd</code> on
          <code>docker-host</code> starts rejecting sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          You resolve this by increasing the <code>MaxSessions</code> setting in
          <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> on <code>docker-host</code>, to 100,
          1,000, or 2,147,483,647 (the max value for a 32-bit signed integer, to
          disable this limit entirely).
        </p>
        <p>
          However, even after bumping <code>MaxSessions</code> and restarting
          the <code>sshd</code> service, you still see the error message.
          <code>sshd -T</code> shows that <code>sshd_config</code> is valid and
          you set <code>MaxSessions</code> correctly. What&#39;s going on?
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem is, restarting <code>sshd</code> doesn&#39;t kill existing SSH
          sessions. On <code>docker-host</code>, those existing sessions are
          supported by existing <code>sshd</code> instances. And those existing
          processes use the old configuration from <code>sshd_config</code>...
          including <code>MaxSessions 10</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fixing the immediate problem is easy. Just delete
          <code>~/.ssh/control-...</code> from <code>jump-host</code>. But how
          to avoid this next time you update <code>sshd_config</code>?
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of the problem is <code>ControlPersist yes</code>. This means
          that the master SSH session between <code>jump-host</code> and
          <code>docker-host</code>, the one that all the multiplexed sessions
          run on, stays open until you close it manually. Even between
          <code>sshd</code> service restarts.
        </p>
        <p>
          So you change ControlPersist to a time, e.g. <code>60m</code>. That
          way, if the master session lives for more than 60 minutes, it&#39;ll close
          as soon as all its multiplexed sessions also close. Which should
          happen... at some point? Probably? Fingers crossed.
