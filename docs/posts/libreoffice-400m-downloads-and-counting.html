<p>The histogram says it all.</p>
<p>First, rapid growth between 2011 and 2014 to 30 million downloads, despite the fierce hostility of the project created to kill LibreOffice.</p>
<p>Then a few years of stagnation, at a time when it seemed that desktop office suites were destined to die, and fashion was driving users to the cloud.</p>
<p>Then the upswing, when even the most fashionable users realised that desktop office suites would never die and would coexist with the cloud.</p>
<p>In 2019, a series of attacks on the download counter – no data is collected other than the click on the DOWNLOAD button – led to a barely credible increase (the figure you see has already been cleaned up as much as possible).</p>
<p>After 2019, a slow but inexorable growth to over 35 million downloads – and 400 million downloads since 2011, with an average of 28.6 million downloads per year – in 2024.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone: those who developed LibreOffice, those who helped improve it, and those who downloaded it to use it.</p>
