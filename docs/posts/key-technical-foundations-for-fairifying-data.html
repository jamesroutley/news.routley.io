    <h1>Key Technical Foundations for FAIRifying Data</h1>

<p>The key technical foundations for FAIRifying data are (1) ubiquitous persistent identifiers; (2) rich controlled metadata; and (3) granular programmatic access. These foundations provide a basis for FAIR data infrastructure.</p>
<p>This note is inspired by <a href="https://anchor.fm/fairdatapodcast/episodes/Sharif-Islam-e1siagt">Rory Macneil’s recent interview with Sharif Islam on the FAIR Data Podcast</a>, published on 2022-12-21. In particular, I expand on the Q&amp;A segment starting at PT14M10S.</p>

<p>Identifiers must be persistent.
Persistence is a matter of service, which needs organizational support.
Furthermore, you are playing on hard mode here if you don’t ensure global uniqueness via HTTPS URIs.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Crucially, PIDs must be ubiquitous across data holdings.
A single PID that addresses all study-publication data elements as an aggregate, e.g. “one DOI for the primary article’s supplemental dataset”, is insufficient.</p>

<p>Metadata makes PIDs findable. Catalogs and search portals use metadata to help you find PID-associated content. Metadata elements must be controlled; that is, so-called controlled vocabularies must be used to boost (a) leverage in tagging and (b) precision and recall in retrieval, which is critical with “big” data-item collections. Furthermore, the controlled metadata needs to be rich — tracking only “minimal” required metadata elements is insufficient. Finally, you are playing on hard mode if your control mechanism does not use PIDs for knowledge organization. A system of least power here is the W3C Simple Knowledge Organization System (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/">SKOS</a>).</p>

<p>Programmatic access must be supported. A well-documented, open-standards-based protocol
facilitates machine-to-machine interactions to glue things together
in a way that is distinct from affordances possible with human-centered interfaces (including bespoke APIs) and portals. This programmatic access must be granular — egress costs scale with data volume delivered, so let users sub-select slices of data. You are again playing on hard mode if programmatic access, and communicating granularity of such access, does not use PIDs. The <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html">HTTP</a> protocol and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html">URI</a> scheme were designed for this, as were the W3C Resource Description Framework (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/">RDF</a>) Recommendations.</p>
