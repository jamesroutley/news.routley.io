Some scientists get their ideas while cutting their way through the Amazon with a machete. I get my scientific ideas while eating omelets with my friend </span><a href="http://www.ethanludwinpeery.com/" rel="">Ethan</a><span>.</span></p><p>One day we were at the diner, trying to figure out why some things seem good and other things seem bad. For instance, why do people hate Congress and love their phones? Obviously the answer is “Congress is bad and my phone is good,” but what’s actually happening in people’s heads when they say that? If you ask a psychologist to explain how this works, they’ll give you a blank stare.</p><p><span>We figured that judgments must be built on comparisons: to say that something is </span><em>bad </em><span>is really to say that it’s </span><em>worse </em><span>than something else. The thing you compare it to is just whatever pops into your head, even if it doesn’t exist, or can’t exist. Basically, if you can easily imagine something being better, then it must not be very good. So Congress seems bad because it’s easy to imagine how Congress could be way better—for starters, it could have fewer villains. But phones seem great because it’s hard to imagine huge improvements—even if their batteries lasted much longer, for instance, it wouldn’t change phones from terrible to amazing.</span></p><p><span>If the mind works like that, it would make a ton of sense. It would also explain why people get really mad about things they can’t actually change, but they can easily </span><em>imagine </em><span>being better, like Congress, or the threat of nuclear war, or traffic. We thought that would be a pretty neat thing to discover, so we finished our omelets and started running studies.</span></p><p>And we were totally wrong. Instead, we discovered something weirder. We keep seeing it over and over again, and we can’t figure out how to make it go away. Today, I’m here to tell you all about it.</p><p><span>It goes like this: when people imagine how things could be </span><em>different</em><span>, they almost always imagine how things could be </span><em>better</em><span>.</span></p><p>I’m going to show you eight studies (plus a bonus study) documenting this effect and trying to figure out why it happens and what it means. The phenomenon appears to be incredibly robust. It doesn&#39;t depend on the wording of the question, what we ask about, the kind of people we ask, or the language we ask the question in. We think it might offer a peek into human nature, and it may explain why it’s so hard for people to get happier.</p><p><span>This is a real scientific paper, except you don’t have to pay a million dollars to access it. You can get all the data, code, materials, and preregistrations </span><a href="https://osf.io/bk7zt/" rel="">here</a><span>. (That includes the wording of every question and everything else you need the replicate every study.) And you can cite this project like this:</span></p><p>Mastroianni, AM &amp; Ludwin-Peery, EJ. (2022). Things could be better. https://psyarxiv.com/2uxwk</p><p>Now for the science.</p><p>Most participants came from either Amazon Mechanical Turk or Prolific, which are sites where you can sign up to take studies for money. Study 7 participants were recruited for us by a company called Qualtrics. Everybody earned $1-$1.20 and the studies took a few minutes. We included lots of attention checks and tossed out anyone who didn&#39;t pass them, but we still paid them regardless.</p><p>We wanted to ask people to imagine how a bunch of things could be different, but we didn’t want to pick the things ourselves, since that might bias the results. So we started this project by getting 91 people to list things they think about or interact with on a regular basis. We kept all the items that were listed by six or more people, except for a few items we thought wouldn’t be relevant to everybody. For instance, we dropped “girlfriend” because we figured not everybody has a girlfriend. That left us with 52 items like “your phone” and “people” and “the economy.”</p><p>We got another group of 243 people, showed each person six random items from our list, and asked people how those things could be different. For example, you might be asked: “How could YouTube be different?&#34; while your friend might be asked “How could food be different?&#34;. You might say “YouTube could load faster” and your friend might say “food could be more expensive” or whatever.</p><p>Then we asked people, “If [THING] was different in this way, how much better or worse would it be?” People gave a rating on a scale from -3 (much worse) to 0 (neither better nor worse) to 3 (much better). What we wanted to know was: when asked how something could be different, do people on average imagine how it could be better, worse, or neither?</p><p><span>The answer was shockingly clear: people imagined how things could be </span><em>better</em><span>. Here are some examples.</span></p><p>Us: “How could your phone be different?”</p><p>Participants:</p><ul><li><p>“it could be waterproof”</p></li><li><p>“My phone could be bendable and flexible.”</p></li><li><p>“Brighter screen”</p></li></ul><p>Us: “How could your life be different?”</p><p>Participants:</p><ul><li><p>“I could be rich”</p></li><li><p>“Have more money”</p></li><li><p>“I could be more wealthy so I wouldn&#39;t have to worry about finances so much”</p></li></ul><p>Us: “How could YouTube be different?</p><p>Participants:</p><ul><li><p>“It could stop nagging me about trying their premium service every time I go to watch a video.”</p></li><li><p>“No ads”</p></li><li><p>“Fixing the algorithm to not screw over creators”</p></li></ul><p><span>This happened for </span><em>every single item</em><span>. In the chart below, items above the dotted red line were items that people imagined could be better, on average. Every dot is floating above that line, and none of the confidence intervals include zero.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ecb9b9-864a-4446-bac8-26457dad2b28_1200x630.jpeg" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ecb9b9-864a-4446-bac8-26457dad2b28_1200x630.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ecb9b9-864a-4446-bac8-26457dad2b28_1200x630.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ecb9b9-864a-4446-bac8-26457dad2b28_1200x630.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ecb9b9-864a-4446-bac8-26457dad2b28_1200x630.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ecb9b9-864a-4446-bac8-26457dad2b28_1200x630.jpeg" width="1200" height="630" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/14ecb9b9-864a-4446-bac8-26457dad2b28_1200x630.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:630,&#34;width&#34;:1200,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ecb9b9-864a-4446-bac8-26457dad2b28_1200x630.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ecb9b9-864a-4446-bac8-26457dad2b28_1200x630.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ecb9b9-864a-4446-bac8-26457dad2b28_1200x630.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ecb9b9-864a-4446-bac8-26457dad2b28_1200x630.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>Error bars = 95% confidence intervals</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>People even told us how </span><em>good</em><span> things could be better. We had people rate how good each thing is right now, and “pets” got the highest rating. People loved pets more than “vacations,” more than “friends,” more than “happiness” and “love”!

Instead, they imagined how everything could be better. </p><p><span>And it wasn’t just a few people. Literally 90% of participants imagined how things could be better, on average. In psychology, that pretty much never happens. Even with a question as obvious as “would you rather get five dollars or get hit in the head with a wrench,” you </span><em>might </em><span>get something like 90% of participants saying “five dollars please” but the rest of them would say “wrench” either because they’re trolling you or they have a wrench fetish.

When we asked people about how good these things are </span><em>right now</em><span>, people were perfectly happy to tell us that lots of things are great.

If you ask an interior designer how your home could be different, they won’t tell you, “Well you could have a bunch of stray dogs come in here and barf everywhere and then we could set your chaise lounge on fire, that would be different.” Instead they’d probably tell you something like, “We could paint it a nice shade of pearl.&#34; Maybe in most cases, people interpret requests for changes as requests for improvements.</p><p><span>There’s one piece of evidence against this possibility: 51% of participants gave us at least one way things could be worse. (For instance, one person said that pets “could have fleas.”) It would be pretty odd for participants to assume that obviously we wanted them to tell us how things could be better, and then they sometimes tell us how things could be </span><em>worse</em><span>. </span></p><p>But hey, it’s possible! So we ran another study.</p><p>We got another group of 169 people and asked them, “If we asked you how [ITEM] could be [“different”/“better or worse”/“worse or better”], would you assume that we wanted you to list ways it could be better, ways it could be worse, a mix of better/worse, would you not assume any of the above, or are you not sure?”</p><p>Sure enough, a slight majority thought “different” meant better. Most people thought that asking for ways something could be “better or worse” or “worse or better” meant we wanted a mix of better and worse.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bc471f0-efe9-44f2-a20e-9a377b935a71_1200x630.jpeg" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bc471f0-efe9-44f2-a20e-9a377b935a71_1200x630.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bc471f0-efe9-44f2-a20e-9a377b935a71_1200x630.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bc471f0-efe9-44f2-a20e-9a377b935a71_1200x630.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bc471f0-efe9-44f2-a20e-9a377b935a71_1200x630.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bc471f0-efe9-44f2-a20e-9a377b935a71_1200x630.jpeg" width="1200" height="630" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3bc471f0-efe9-44f2-a20e-9a377b935a71_1200x630.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:630,&#34;width&#34;:1200,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:114743,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bc471f0-efe9-44f2-a20e-9a377b935a71_1200x630.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bc471f0-efe9-44f2-a20e-9a377b935a71_1200x630.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bc471f0-efe9-44f2-a20e-9a377b935a71_1200x630.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bc471f0-efe9-44f2-a20e-9a377b935a71_1200x630.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Great, we thought.

Of course, there’s a lot more to people than whether they are old and whether they have a high school diploma. </p><p><span>We thought being anxious, depressed, or neurotic might make a big difference. Maybe people who feel really bad can easily think of ways that things could be better (e.g., “I could feel less bad”). Or maybe they feel bad because they’re always thinking about ways that things could get </span><em>worse</em><span> (“What if I die alone?”). It would be cool to know either way, so we ran another study.</span></p><p>We re-ran Study 1 with another 250 people. This time, we also had them fill out a depression scale, an anxiety scale, and a Big 5 personality questionnaire, which includes a measure of neuroticism (sometimes this is called “emotional stability” because that sounds nicer).</p><p>Once again, people imagined how every single item could be better. (That’s replication, baby. 😎)</p><p>Depression and anxiety made no difference: people imagined how things could be better regardless of how depressed or anxious they were. Just look at how flat these trend lines are:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7d36ee-72dc-4df2-b53d-79bfc63b61f2_633x515.jpeg" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7d36ee-72dc-4df2-b53d-79bfc63b61f2_633x515.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7d36ee-72dc-4df2-b53d-79bfc63b61f2_633x515.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7d36ee-72dc-4df2-b53d-79bfc63b61f2_633x515.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7d36ee-72dc-4df2-b53d-79bfc63b61f2_633x515.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7d36ee-72dc-4df2-b53d-79bfc63b61f2_633x515.jpeg" width="633" height="515" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9a7d36ee-72dc-4df2-b53d-79bfc63b61f2_633x515.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:515,&#34;width&#34;:633,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7d36ee-72dc-4df2-b53d-79bfc63b61f2_633x515.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7d36ee-72dc-4df2-b53d-79bfc63b61f2_633x515.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7d36ee-72dc-4df2-b53d-79bfc63b61f2_633x515.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7d36ee-72dc-4df2-b53d-79bfc63b61f2_633x515.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Neuroticism didn’t matter either (controlling for all other personality variables). But weirdly enough, people who were more open to experience were more likely to imagine how things could be better. We don’t have any explanation for this, and maybe it doesn’t mean anything. No other personality variables made any difference.</p><p>These results really surprised us. You’d think depressed, anxious, and neurotic people would be especially able to think of ways things could be better, or that they would always be worrying about ways things could get worse.

Somehow they do it by default anyway.</p><p><span>When you ask people to imagine how things could be different, they imagine how things could be </span><em>better</em><span>. This doesn’t depend on how we word the question, and it happens in people’s everyday thoughts. Everybody seems to do it; demographics make little difference. Polish people also imagine how things could be better, as do Chinese people answering in Mandarin. And people imagine how things could be better even though it appears to be harder than imagining how things could be worse.</span></p><p><span>This tendency may be fundamental, because it seems awfully hard to make it go away. As I’ve written before, </span><a href="https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/psychology-might-be-a-big-stinkin" rel="">lots of published psychological findings may be a big stinkin’ load of hogwash</a><span>. Some of that is because of statistical misunderstandings and some of that is because of outright fraud, but some of that is because most of what we discover in psychology is extremely contextual. Often, if you change the circumstances even a tiny bit, the effects change too.</span></p><p>So far, this finding doesn’t seem to be like that. We can’t find a single thing that people, on average, imagine being worse. Nor have we found any group of people that doesn’t seem to do it. In psychology, this pretty much never happens. So we’re excited.</p><p><span>It does look like we were wrong about the whole thing where people think Congress is bad because they can easily imagine how Congress could be better. People can easily imagine how </span><em>everything </em><span>could be better.</span></p><p><span>We did sometimes find that people were more likely to say that bad things could be better, compared to good things. But not always. We found the opposite in Study 4, when we asked people about their naturally occurring thoughts, and in Study 7, when we asked people in Mandarin. In those studies, the more that people thought something was already good, the more they thought about how it could be </span><em>better</em><span>. And in Study 8, when we asked people to come up with ways things could be better, they came up with just as many improvements for good things as for bad things. We’re not really sure why that happened.</span></p><p>Regardless, we think it’s safe to send our original hypothesis to that big farm upstate where it can run and play with other falsified hypotheses.</p><p>Honestly, who knows. Brains are weird, man.</p><p>When all else fails, we can always turn to natural selection: maybe this bias helped our ancestors survive. Hungry, rain-soaked hunter-gatherers imagined food in their bellies and roofs over their heads and invented agriculture and architecture. Once warm and full, they out-reproduced their brethren who were busy imagining how much hungrier and wetter they could be.</p><p>But really, this is a mystery. We may have uncovered something fundamental about how human imagination works, but it might be a long time before we understand it.</p><p><span>Everybody knows about the </span><a href="https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/the-five-tools-of-hedonic-design" rel="">hedonic treadmill</a><span>: once you’re moderately happy, it’s hard to get happier. But nobody has ever really explained </span><em>why </em><span>this happens. People say things like, “oh, you get used to good things,” but that’s just a description, not an explanation. </span><em>Why </em><span>do people get used to good things?</span></p><p><span>Now we might have an answer: people get used to good things because they’re always imagining how things could be better. So even if things </span><em>get</em><span> better, you might not </span><em>feel</em><span> better. When you live in a cramped apartment, you dream of getting a house. When you get a house, </span><a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/time-machine" rel="">you dream of a second house</a><span>. Or you dream of lower property taxes. Or a hot tub. Or two hot tubs. And so on, forever.</span></p><p><span>The paper you just read could never be published in a scientific journal. The studies themselves are just as good as the ones Ethan and I have published in </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797620957610" rel="">fancy</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2107260119" rel="">journals</a><span>, but writing about science this way is verboten.</span></p><p>For instance, in a journal you’re not allowed to say things like “we don’t know why this happens.” You’re not allowed to admit that you forgot why you ran a study. And you’re DEFINITELY not allowed to talk about Dyngus Day. You’re supposed to be very serious; a reviewer once literally told me that my paper was “too fun” and that I should make it more boring. You’re supposed to pack your paper with pointless citations because reviewers might like your paper more if they see their name in it. And if reviewers don’t like your paper, they’ll reject it and nobody will ever see it.</p><p><span>This is a stupid way to do science. It goes against every single one of the </span><a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/02/10/the-scientific-virtues/" rel="">scientific virtues</a><span>. It leads to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias" rel="">publication bias</a><span>—reviewers prefer studies with “statistically significant” results that confirm their preexisting biases, filling “the literature” with junk articles that are often </span><a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/04/23/academic-papers-citation-rates-remler/#:~:text=But%20expert%20evaluation%20has%20indeed,analysis%20recently%20darted%20about%20cyberspace." rel="">never cited at all</a><span>. Doing peer review this way also costs </span><a href="https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-021-00118-2" rel="">more than a billion dollars a year</a><span>, money that could instead be spent on more elaborate Dyngus Day costumes.</span></p><p><span>Instead, you can review this paper right here in the comments, or on your own blog, or on Twitter, if it still exists by the time you read this. And if you can find us on the street, you can shout your review directly at us, and we’ll shout back. Remember that you can find everything you need to replicate all of our studies and analyses </span><a href="https://osf.io/bk7zt/" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>If we did publish this in a journal, there’s a good chance you wouldn’t be able to read it at all unless a) you belong to an institution that pays millions of dollars in scientific journal subscriptions, or b) you use a pirate website like </span><a href="https://sci-hub.se/" rel="">Sci-Hub</a><span>, which we of course do not recommend because it’s illegal and bad.</span></p><p>It’s almost as if we can’t help but imagine ways that scientific publishing could be better. Somebody should write a paper about that.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Gilbert, Fiery Cushman, Tali Sharot, Yev, hugo villeneuve, Sean Trott, Marco Plebani, Bash, Bimal Shah, Samvit Jain, Amy Summerville, Arbituram, and Lukas Neugebauer for their comments and reviews.</em></p></div></div></div></div>
