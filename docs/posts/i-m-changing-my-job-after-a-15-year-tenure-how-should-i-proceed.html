      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hello HN, I&#39;ve been at my current company for the past 15 years. I&#39;ve taken on different roles where I started as a software engineer, before being promoted to lead, and then to staff engineer. I know my current company by heart. I know how to get things done. I know who to talk to and how to talk to the right people. I know the processes of my company in and out.<p>I decided to get out of my comfort zone. Try something new, I told myself on and on for the past 3 years. And I finally did it. I&#39;m changing jobs.</p><p>I&#39;m going to a new company, where I&#39;ll be doing something slightly similar to my previous role, but in a totally new field. I don&#39;t know anyone there. The people seem extremely friendly and fun to work with. This is what I felt in the hiring process.</p><p>It feels like I forgot how I got good at this. Technically, I have no doubts to get things done. However, on the people level, I have no clue how to get started. How do I make &#34;new friends&#34; at work?</p><p>What do you usually do when you switch to a new company? How do you go from the &#34;new clueless person at work&#34; to &#34;oh hey Mike, I&#39;ll need your help this afternoon&#34;?</p></td></tr>
