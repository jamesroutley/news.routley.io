        <p>The Moon has become more beautiful in the past few months. I look up and the Moon is stunning, but I feel like I shouldn’t look away. I look at the moon and feel crazy. I feel crazed but also crazy for not spending as much time as possible looking at it. Moonmaxxing or Moon FOMO.</p>

<p>I’ve tried using timers to make sure I at least look 1 continuous minute. I’m lucky to have a beautiful view of the Moonrise over the mountain each night, so I try to at least catch the whole thing. But I can’t help staring more throughout the night, and somehow it’s so perfect it’s at least as painful as it is nice to look at.</p>

<p>The Moon - it’s completely fucked that it’s there. I don’t know…</p>

<p>I also can’t make anything as beautiful as the moon I don’t think - and sometimes that makes me mad. I’ve wondered if this is really what coined lunacy. Anyone else experiencing this right now??</p>
