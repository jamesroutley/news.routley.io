    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    
    <p>Kind of Bloop is a chiptune tribute to Miles Davis&#39; Kind of Blue, a track-by-track
      8-bit reinterpretation of the bestselling jazz album of all time.</p>
      
    <p>Launched as a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/waxpancake/kind-of-bloop-an-8-bit-tribute-to-miles-davis">Kickstarter 
      project</a> in April 2009, only two weeks after Kickstarter itself opened its 
      doors, the album&#39;s production was funded by 419 backers around the world.</p>
      
    <p>Kind of Bloop was released on August 17, 2009, on the 50th anniversary of 
      Kind of Blue.</p>
      
    <p>The album is perhaps best known for the <a href="https://waxy.org/2011/06/kind_of_screwed/">out-of-court 
      settlement</a> involving its cover artwork, which led to a huge public outcry, press attention, and its
      ongoing citation in scholarly journals.
      
    </p><p>To celebrate Kind of Blue&#39;s 60th birthday, and the 10 year anniversary of Kind 
      of Bloop&#39;s release, Kind of Bloop is now free to download and listen for the 
      first time. If you like it, feel free to spread the word.</p>
