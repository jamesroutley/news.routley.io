<p>So you just switched to a split keyboard, you can sort of type again, now what?
What are some improvements you might enjoy?</p>

<p>Try it out!</p>
<p>Whenever I make a change to my keyboard layout, I immediately test it with a typing tutor.</p>
<p>I like <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">monkeytype</a>, because I can change the input language to “code python”, “code haskell”, Swedish, etc.</p>
<p>I’ve also heard good things about <a href="https://play.typeracer.com/">TypeRacer</a> but haven’t tried it myself.</p>
<p>I recommend making it easy to change your layout. Then you can explore, and undo if it’s not for you.</p>

<p>Koalas have two thumbs, but I do not!</p>
<p>I blew out my left arm for a year and a half after writing code on an IBM Model M for several years of sixteen hours a day.
It started with the dreaded “emacs pinky”, aka RSI from using your pinky to press control too much.</p>
<p>After my left arm recovered, I realized if something that hurts, stop doing that thing!</p>
<p>So I bought a <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">Kinesis Advantage</a>, moved all my modifier keys to the thumb clusters, and haven’t had the problem since.</p>
<p>That’s my first suggestion, if your split keyboard has thumb keys, that’s a good place for alt, ctrl, shift, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard#Description">hyper, super</a>, and altgr.</p>

<p>Layers are a straightforward extension of the idea that holding down shift gets you capital letters instead of lower case letters.</p>
<p>I wore out five Kinesis Advantage keyboards, and years later bought an early <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ergodox-ez</a>.</p>
<p>Kinesis keyboards are large, and I got tired of carrying mine back and forth to work. The ergodox-ez was far more portable.</p>
<p>The ergodox had fewer keys than the kinesis, and I’d already bound all my function keys to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Interface#Design_rules">specific uses</a> (email, IRC, time clock, etc).</p>
<p>I came up with two additional “layers” and put my function keys on the second layer in place of the matching numbers. So, holding down the layer-1 key and pressing what would be the number 1 sends the key F1.</p>
<p>Random trivia: Did you know letters can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_figures">lower case</a>?</p>

<p>I also bought one of the first few <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander">Moonlander</a> keyboards.</p>
<p>While it was fun configuring my ergodox by editing the C source code of the keymap, the moonlander’s ability to edit and share keyboard layouts on the web is great for exploring.</p>
<p>I also found it far easier to carry my moonlander in my backpack because it comes with a decent travel case.</p>
<p>The Moonlander was my first exposure to <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/features/tap_dance">tap dance</a> functionality. The Moonlander web layout editor supports four different inputs, including press and release (tap), press and release twice, press and hold, and tap and then hold.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/QX5qp/latest/0">my Moonlander layout</a> or browse many <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/search">public layouts</a> for ideas.</p>

<p>When do you want a layer?</p>
<p>Many of my friends create a custom layer for qwerty input for web games. For example, Angel has a layout with <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/0LNJQ/latest/0">six layers</a> that includes gaming and Italian layers.</p>
<p>I try to put my most commonly used keys on the primary layer, and push
less frequently used keys to deeper layers. I like to have a layer for
media commands like volume controls and skip to the next track. If the
keyboard firmware offers mouse movement keys, I try to fit those into
<a href="https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/QX5qp/b6j67/2">a layer</a>.</p>
<p>I like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coding</a> approach where rarely used keystrokes
require more keypresses.</p>

<p>I haven’t used these much, because my primary keyboards have lots of keys compared to the latest <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/">fashion</a>.</p>
<p>I recently purchased a <a href="https://peterlyons.com/problog/2024/05/kipra-keyboard/">kipra</a>, and now I really do need tap dance!</p>
<p>I expect to follow Angel’s approach to compress my Ergodox six key
thumb clusters into fewer keys. Right now I have backspace and left
shift next to each other. If you click on the <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/0LNJQ/latest/0">bottom leftmost key</a>
you’ll see it’s backspace when tapped, and left shift when held.</p>

<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout">Dvorak</a> for decades. I learned the modern US Dvorak,
but that’s not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout#Original_layout">original Dvorak</a> layout. I tried the original number
layout (but not symbols) in their surprising order for a few weeks,
but went back to Modern Dvorak because I just didn’t get much
benefit. I later replaced the number key row with <a href="https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/">Programmer Dvorak</a>
and that was pleasant for awhile, but yet again, no real benefit. I
then tried swapping the symbols and numbers on Modern Dvorak, but I
type the numbers more often than symbols (Haskell).</p>

<p>If your goal is to be able to type with as little hand movement as possible, there’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataHand">DataHand</a>, and its <a href="https://github.com/JesusFreke/lalboard">3d printable clone</a>.</p>
<p>If you use emacs, try <a href="https://github.com/shapr/markovkeyboard/">markovkeyboard</a>?</p>

<p>Oh right! This is my first <a href="https://www.scannedinavian.com/buy-a-blog-post.html">buy a blog post</a>
and was funded by <a href="https://blog.frodux.org/">Chris</a>.</p>
