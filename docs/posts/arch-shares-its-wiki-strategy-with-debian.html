<p>The <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux project</a> is
especially well-known in the Linux community for two things: its
rolling-release model and the quality of the documentation in the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page">ArchWiki</a>. No
matter which Linux distribution one uses, the odds are that eventually
the ArchWiki&#39;s documentation will prove useful. The Debian project
recognized this and has sought to improve its own documentation game
by inviting ArchWiki maintainers Jakub Klinkovský and Vladimir
Lavallade to <a href="https://debconf25.debconf.org/">DebConf25</a> in
Brest, France, to speak about how Arch manages its wiki. The talk has
already borne fruit with the launch of an effort to revamp the Debian
wiki.</p>

<p><a href="http://tinylogger.com/Articles/1032728/#jakub">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/Jakub_Klinkovsky-sm.png" alt="[Jakub Klinkovský]" title="Jakub Klinkovský" border="0"/>
</a></p><p>Klinkovský and Lavallade were introduced by Debian developer Thomas
Lange, who said that he had the idea to invite the pair to
DebConf. Klinkovský said that he had been a maintainer of the wiki
since about 2014, and that he is also a package maintainer for Arch
Linux. He added that he contributes to many other projects
&#34;<q>wherever I can</q>&#34;. For his part, Lavallade said that he has
contributed to the wiki since 2021, but he had only recently joined
the maintenance team: &#34;<q>I know just enough to be dangerous</q>.&#34;</p>

<p>Lavallade said that the talk was a good opportunity to
cross-pollinate with another distribution, and to do some
self-reflection on how the wiki team operates. They would explain how
the wiki is run using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis">SWOT analysis</a>
format, with a focus on the content and how the maintenance team keeps
the quality of pages as high as it can. &#34;SWOT&#34;, for those who have
been fortunate enough not to have encountered the acronym through
corporate meetings, is short for &#34;strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats&#34;. SWOT analysis is generally used for
decision-making processes to help analyze the current state 
and identify what an organization needs to improve.</p>

<h4 clear="all">ArchWiki:About</h4>

<p>The ArchWiki was established in 2004; the project originally used
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpWiki">PhpWiki</a> as its
backend—but Klinkovský said that it was quickly migrated to
MediaWiki, which is still in use today. The wiki <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ArchWiki:Maintenance_Team">maintenance</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ArchWiki:Translation_Team">translation</a>
teams were established &#34;<q>about 2010</q>&#34;. The maintenance team is
responsible for the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ArchWiki:Contributing">contribution
guidelines</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Style">style
conventions</a>, organization, and anything else that contributors need
to know.</p>

<p>Today, the wiki has more than 4,000 topic pages; it has close to
30,000 pages if one counts <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Discussion">talk
pages</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Editing#Redirects">redirects</a>,
and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Category:Help">help
pages</a>. &#34;<q>We are still quite a small wiki compared to
Wikipedia</q>&#34;, Klinkovský said.</p>

<p>He displayed a slide, part of which is shown below, with graphs
showing the number of edits and active users per month. The <a href="https://pkgbuild.com/~lahwaacz/DebConf25/#1">full set of
slides</a> is available online as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://tinylogger.com/Articles/1032728/#today">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/archwiki-slide-600.png" alt="[ArchWiki today slide]" title="ArchWiki today slide" border="0"/>
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Since 2006, the wiki has had more than 840,000 edits by more than
86,000 editors; the project is averaging more than 2,000 edits by
about 300 active contributors each month. Klinkovský noted that this
&#34;<q>used to be quite a larger number</q>&#34;.</p>

<h4>Strengths</h4>

<p>Lavallade had a short list of the &#34;<q>best user-facing qualities</q>&#34;
of the ArchWiki, which are the project&#39;s strengths. The first was
&#34;<q>comprehensive content and a very large coverage of various
topics</q>&#34;. He said this included not just how to run Arch Linux, but
how to run important software on the distribution.</p>

<p>The next was having high-quality and up-to-date content. Given that
Arch is a rolling-release distribution, he said, every page has to be
updated to reflect the latest package provided with the
distribution. That is only possible thanks to &#34;<q>a very involved
community</q>&#34;; he noted that most of the edits on the ArchWiki were
made by contributors outside the maintenance team.</p>

<p>All of that brought him to the last strength he wanted to discuss:
its reach beyond the Arch community. He pulled up a slide that included a
quote from Edward Snowden, which said:</p>

<blockquote>
Is it just me, or have search results become absolute garbage for
basically every site? It&#39;s nearly impossible to discover useful
information these days (outside the ArchWiki).
</blockquote>

<h4>Contribution and content guidelines</h4>

<p>The contribution guidelines and processes have a lot to do with the
<a href="http://tinylogger.com/Articles/1032728/#vladimir">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/Vladimir_Lavallad-sm.png" alt="[Vladimir Lavallade]" title="Vladimir Lavallade" border="0"/>
</a>
quality of the content on the wiki. Contributors, he said, have to
follow three fundamental rules. The first is that they must use the
edit summary to explain what has been done and why. The second rule
is that contributors should not make complex edits all at once. As
much as possible, Lavallade said, contributors should do &#34;<q>some kind
of atomic editing</q>&#34; where each change is independent of the other
ones. He did not go into specifics on this during the talk, but the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ArchWiki:Contributing#Do_not_make_complex_edits_at_once">guidelines</a>
have examples of best practices. The third rule is that major changes
or rewrites should be announced on a topic&#39;s talk page to give others
who are watching the topic a chance to weigh in.</p>

<p>The team also has three major content guidelines that Lavallade
highlighted. One that is likely familiar to anyone contributing to
technical documentation is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">don&#39;t
repeat yourself</a> (DRY) principle. A topic should only exist in one
place, rather than being repeated on multiple pages. He also said that
the ArchWiki employed a &#34;<q>simple, but not stupid</q>&#34; approach to
the documentation. This means that the documentation should be simple
to read and maintain, but not offer too much hand-holding. Users also
need to be willing to learn; they may need to read through more
than one page to find the information they need to do something.</p>

<p>The final guideline is that everything is Arch-centric. Content on
the site may be useful for users running different Linux
distributions, and contributions are welcome that may apply to other
distributions, but &#34;<q>something that will not work on Arch as-is is
not something we will be hosting on our site</q>&#34;. That, he said,
allowed the maintenance team to be focused on the content Arch
provides and helps to keep maintenance more manageable.</p>

<h4>Maintenance</h4>

<p>Speaking of maintenance, Klinkovský said, the project has tools and
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Template">templates</a>
to help make life easier for contributors. A reviewer might apply an
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Template:Accuracy">accuracy</a>
template, for instance, which will add it to a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Category:Pages_or_sections_flagged_with_Template:Accuracy">page</a>
that lists all content that has been flagged as possibly
inaccurate. The templates are usually used and acted on by people,
but the project also has bots that can add some templates (such as <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Template:Dead_link">dead
link</a>) and even fix some problems.</p>

<p>The review process is an important part of maintenance, he
said. Everyone can participate in review, not just the maintainers of
the wiki. He explained that it was not possible for the maintenance
team to review everything, so much of the review is done by
people interested in specific topics who watch pages to see when
changes were made. If people spot errors, they are empowered to
fix them on their own, or to use the templates to flag them for others
to address. Maintainers are there, he said, &#34;<q>to make some authoritative
decisions when needed, and mediate disputes if they came up</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>Klinkovský referred to watching and reviewing content on the wiki
as &#34;<q><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Procedures#Patrolling">patrolling</a></q>&#34;,
and said there were some basic rules that should be followed, starting
with &#34;<q>assume good faith</q>&#34;. Most people do something because they
think it is right; the maintainers rarely see outright vandalism on
the wiki.</p>

<p>The second rule, he said, is &#34;<q>when in doubt, discuss
changes with others before making a hasty decision</q>&#34;. If a change
must be reverted, then a reviewer should always explain <em>why</em>
it was reverted. This gives the original contributor a chance to come
back and fix the problem or address it in a different way. Lastly,
Klinkovský said, they wanted to avoid <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Edit_war">edit wars</a>: &#34;<q>the
worst thing that can happen on a wiki is a few people just reverting
their changes after each other</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>Preventing edit wars and encouraging contributions was, Lavallade
said, part of the broader topic of community management. The team
tries to encourage contributors to not only make one change, but to
learn the guidelines and keep contributing—and then help teach
others the guidelines.</p>

<p>Arch has support forums, such as IRC, and when people ask for help
there they are pointed to the wiki &#34;<q>because there is always the
solution on the ArchWiki</q>&#34;. In the rare event that the wiki does
not have the solution, he said, &#34;<q>we gently point them to where the page
with the content needs to be</q>&#34; and invite the user to add it even
if it&#39;s not perfect the first time. That helps to reinforce the idea
that the wiki is a collaborative work that everyone should feel
welcome to add to.</p>

<h4>Weaknesses</h4>

<p>Lavallade said that the contribution model also illustrated one of
ArchWiki&#39;s weaknesses: there is a lot to learn about contributing to
the wiki, and newcomers can get tripped up. For example, he said that
the DRY principle was difficult for new contributors. Or a newcomer might
add a large chunk of content into a page that should be broken up into
several pages.</p>

<p>The MediaWiki markup language is another hurdle for new
contributors. He called the markup &#34;<q>antiquated</q>&#34;, and
acknowledged that the style conventions for the ArchWiki are not
obvious either. It can take a lot of reading, cross-referencing, and
back-and-forth discussions for a new contributor to make a content
contribution correctly.</p>

<p>MediaWiki has a lot of strengths, Klinkovský said; it is
battle-proven software, it is the de facto standard platform for
wikis, and it has a nice API that can be used for integration with
external applications such as bots. But MediaWiki is a weakness as well, he
said. The platform is primarily developed for Wikipedia, and
its developers are from Wikipedia. &#34;<q>Sometimes their decisions don&#39;t
suit us</q>&#34;, he said, and there was little way to make things exactly
as the ArchWiki maintenance team might want.</p>

<p>The primary weakness, though, was that its markup language is
&#34;<q>very weird and hard to understand both for humans and
machines</q>&#34;. In 2025, most people know and write Markdown daily, but
MediaWiki markup is different. It is weird and fragile; changing a
single token can completely break a page. It is also, he said,
difficult to write a proper or robust parser for the language. This is
particularly true because there is no formal specification of the
language, just the reference implementation in the form of
MediaWiki. That can change at any time: &#34;<q>so even if you had a perfect
parser one day, it might not work the same or perfectly the next
day</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>Since ArchWiki is developed by volunteer contributors, its content
is essentially driven by popularity; people generally only edit the
content that they have an interest in. Klinkovský said that this was
not a weakness, necessarily, but it was related to some
weaknesses. For example, some pages were edited frequently while
others were not touched for years due to lack of interest. To a
reader, it is not obvious whether page content is stale or recently
updated.</p>

<p>There is also no perfect way to ensure that content makes its way
to the wiki. He noted that people might solve their problem in a
discussion on Arch&#39;s forums, but that the solution might never end up
on the wiki.</p>

<h4>Opportunities and threats</h4>

<p>Klinkovský said that they had also identified several areas of
opportunity—such as community involvement and support tools for
editors—where the ArchWiki&#39;s work could be improved.</p>

<p>Lavallade said that one example of community involvement would be
to work with derivatives from Arch Linux, such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamos">SteamOS</a> or
Arch ports to CPU architectures other than x86-64. Currently, Arch is only
supported on x86-64, he noted, but the project has passed an <a href="https://rfc.archlinux.page/0032-arch-linux-ports/">RFC</a> to
expand the number of architectures that would be supported.</p>

<p>Right now, the project has two tools for editors to use to make
their work a bit easier: <a href="https://lahwaacz.github.io/wiki-scripts/">wiki-scripts</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/kynikos/wiki-monkey/wiki">Wiki
Monkey</a>. Klinkovský explained that wiki-scripts was a collection of
Python scripts used to automate common actions, such as checking if
links actually work. Wiki Monkey is an interactive JavaScript tool
that runs in the web browser, he said, and can help contributors
improve content. For example, it has <a href="https://github.com/kynikos/wiki-monkey/wiki/Bundled-plugins">plugins</a>
to expand contractions, fix headers, convert HTML
<tt>&lt;code&gt;</tt> tags into proper MediaWiki markup, and more.</p>

<p>There is much more that could be added or improved, he said, like
linting software for grammar issues. The team might also consider
incorporating machine learning or AI techniques into the editor
workflow, &#34;<q>but this needs to be done carefully so we don&#39;t cause
more trouble than we have right now</q>&#34;. The trouble the team has
with AI right now will probably sound familiar to anyone running an
open-source project today; specifically, AI-generated content that is
not up to par and scraper bots.</p>

<p>People have already tried contributing to ArchWiki using AI, but
Klinkovský pointed out that &#34;<q>current models are obviously not
trained on our style guidelines, because the content does not
fit</q>&#34;. Using AI for problem solving also prevents people from fully
understanding a solution or how things work. That may be a problem for
the whole of society, he said, not just ArchWiki.</p>

<p>The scraper bot problem is a more immediate concern, in that the
project had to put the wiki behind <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1028558/">Anubis</a> in the early part
of the year for about two months. Currently they do not need to use
it, Klinkovský said, but they have it on standby if the bots come
back. &#34;<q>So this is still a threat and we cannot consider it
solved.</q>&#34;</p>

<p>Another, non-technical, threat that the project faces is
burnout. Lavallade said that contributor burnout is a real problem,
and that people who have stayed a long while &#34;<q>usually start with a
good, strong string of changes, but they end up tapering their amount
of contributions</q>&#34;. Everyone, he said, ends up running out of steam
at some point. Because of that, there is a need to keep bringing in
new contributors to replace people who have moved on.</p>

<h4>Questions</h4>

<p>One member of the audience wanted to know if there was a dedicated
chat room for the wiki to discuss changes coming in. Lavallade said
that there is an <tt>#archlinux-wiki</tt> room on <a href="https://libera.chat/">Libera.Chat</a>, and anyone is welcome
there. However, the team frequently redirects conversations about
changes to the talk pages on the wiki to ensure that everyone
interested in a topic can discuss the change.</p>

<p>Steve McIntyre had two questions. He was curious about how many
maintainers the ArchWiki had and what kind of hardware or setup was
on the backend of the wiki &#34;<q>is this like, one virtual machine, or a
cluster?</q>&#34; Klinkovský said that there were about 30 to 50
maintainers at the moment. As far as the setup, he said he was not on
Arch&#39;s DevOps team and didn&#39;t know all the details, but he did know it
was just one virtual machine &#34;<q>in the cloud</q>&#34;.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>Another person wanted to know if the team would choose MediaWiki
again if they were building the wiki today. Klinkovský did not quite
answer directly, but he said that if a project does not like the
markup language used by MediaWiki then it should look to a solution
that uses Markdown. But, if a project needs all of the other features
MediaWiki has, &#34;<q>like plugins or the API for writing bots and so
on</q>&#34;, then MediaWiki is the best from all of the wiki software
available.</p>

<p>One audience member pointed out that the chart seemed to show a
spike in activity beginning with COVID and a steady decline
since. They asked if the team had noticed that, and what they were
doing about it. Klinkovský said that they had not looked at that
problem as a whole team, or discussed what they could do about it. He
said that if Arch added new architectures or accepted contributions
from Arch-derivative distributions, it might reverse the trend.</p>

<p>Lange closed the session by saying that he thought it was funny
that the presenters had said they wanted ArchWiki to be Arch-centric:
&#34;<q>I think you failed, because a lot of other people are reading your
really great, big wiki</q>&#34;.</p>

<h4>Debian embraces MediaWiki</h4>

<p>The session seems to have been a success in that it has helped to
inspire the Debian project to <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianWiki/WikiRevamp">revamp</a> its
own wiki. Immediately after the ArchWiki presentation, there was a <a href="https://debconf25.debconf.org/talks/146-debian-wiki-bof/">Debian
wiki BoF</a> where it was decided to use MediaWiki. Debian currently
uses the <a href="https://moinmo.in/">MoinMoin</a> 1.9 branch, which
depends on Python 2.7.</p>

<p>Since DebConf25, members of the wiki team have worked with the
Debian&#39;s system administrators team to put up <a href="https://wiki2025.debian.org/wiki/Main_Page">wiki2025.debian.org</a>
to eventually replace the current wiki. They have also created a new
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-wiki/">debian-wiki</a>
mailing list and decided to change the content licensing policy for
material contributed to the wiki. Changes submitted to the wiki after
July 24 <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/copyright.html">are now
licensed</a> under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license</a> unless otherwise
noted.</p>

<p>If Debian can sustain the activity that has gone into the wiki
revamp since DebConf25, its wiki might give the ArchWiki project
a run for its money. In that case, given that ArchWiki has proven such
a good resource for Linux users regardless of distribution, everybody
will win.</p>
