<p>DuckDuckGo’s daily search queries have surpassed 100 million, with a 47 percent increase expected in 2021.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo, a search engine with enhanced privacy protection, is currently gaining popularity.</p>
<p>According to the company, daily search queries have surpassed 100 million.</p>

<p>It has grown by nearly 47 percent in just 2021.</p>
<p>The Search Engine DuckDuckGo Is Getting Bigger</p>
<p>The rising platform has shown a significant improvement in terms of year-over-year growth, according to a report published over the weekend by Bleeping Computer.</p>
<p>Despite Google’s search engine dominance, many people are experimenting with the privacy-focused platform.</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo received 79 million daily search queries on average last year in this month.</p>
<p>In addition, the platform’s total search queries were 23.6 billion at the time.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania-based company received an average of 100 million daily search queries in 2021.</p>
<p>The total number of search queries has reached 34.6 billion so far, with four days until the year 2022 begins.</p>

<p>This year, the team grew by 46.4 percent.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo Mac Version Coming Soon</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo has a low market share.</p>
<p>According to the same report from Bleeping Computer, there’s still a lot to see for the DuckDuckGo search engine’s progress.</p>
<p>Despite strong growth this year, its market share still trails that of its competitors.</p>
<p>With that, it only has a 2.53 percent share of the total market, which is slightly less than Yahoo’s 3.3 percent and Bing’s 6.43 percent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Google remains the most popular internet search engine in the United States, accounting for 87.33 percent of all search traffic.</p>
<p>The DuckDuckGo desktop web browser is currently in development, according to Tech Times.</p>
<p>In a recent blog post, the company’s CEO, Gabriel Weinberg, confirmed this.</p>
<p>Google vs. DuckDuckGo (DuckDuckGo vs. Google)</p>
<p>According to a separate report from Spread Privacy, Google will track users when they use the search engine, whereas DuckDuckGo will not.</p>
<p>The company guarantees that the information of its users will be kept safe and private when using this new platform.</p>
<p>The general perception of these platforms is that your data is mined and tracked for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>This explains why you see ads that are very similar to your interests.</p>
<p>Users will be protected from email tracking by the privacy-focused search engine’s “Email Protection.”</p>
<p>Scammers who want to track your actual email address for malicious purposes won’t be able to do so now.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo’s Android ecosystem includes “App Tracking” protection, which prevents third-party trackers from being used.</p>
