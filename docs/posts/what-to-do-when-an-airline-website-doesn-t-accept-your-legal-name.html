    <h1>What to do when an airline website doesn&#39;t accept your legal name</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--[--><p>4 April 2024 Â· <i>5 min read</i></p><div><p><!--[-->Southwest is a company that I used to respect for good customer service<sup><a aria-current="page" href="https://www.preethamrn.com/posts/southwest-flight-bug#user-content-fn-1" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="" id="user-content-fnref-1"><!--[-->1<!--]--></a></sup>. Their fares are reasonable and not having to worry about extra fees for checked bags or carry-ons is nice. They also make canceling flights for a flight credit really simple. Flight credits can be applied to get a discount on future flights if booked for the same person. Or so I thought until I tried using it recently...<!--]--></p><p><!--[--><img src="https://www.preethamrn.com/_ipx/h_30&amp;w_30&amp;f_webp&amp;blur_1&amp;q_80/posts/southwest-flight-bug/initial_error.png" onerror="this.setAttribute(&#39;data-error&#39;, 1)" alt="The initial error" loading="lazy" data-nuxt-img=""/><!--]--></p><p><!--[-->When I tried applying my flight credits, I was greeted by this error message. Refreshing the page, double checking all the details, trying to book a different date or time - nothing worked. Turns out this is a known bug and <a href="https://community.southwest.com/t5/Travel-Policies/can-not-apply-for-my-travel-fund/td-p/99019#messageview_2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><!--[-->it&#39;s existed for at least the last 4 years<!--]--></a>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Reading through the comments, it hit me. My legal first name has a space in it. Southwest doesn&#39;t like that. But the TSA doesn&#39;t like when the name on my ticket doesn&#39;t match the name on my ID (<a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/does-name-my-airline-reservation-have-match-name-my-application" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><!--[-->it&#39;s illegal<!--]--></a>). I guessed that when storing my name for the flight credit, they truncated my first name so it only kept the first word (removing my &#34;middle&#34; name).<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->I tried different combinations of using my legal name and the truncated name in the flight credits input and the passenger information input. Nothing worked. It always either complained that my name didn&#39;t match the name of the flight credit or that the flight credit didn&#39;t match the name in the passenger information. The closest I got was being able to apply the flight credits by truncating my first name on the ticket but then I got an error when actually booking the ticket because I needed to change my first name back to my legal name and it no longer matched the flight credit.<!--]--></p><div data-v-366869b9=""><p><!--[--><img src="https://www.preethamrn.com/_ipx/h_30&amp;w_30&amp;f_webp&amp;blur_1&amp;q_80/posts/southwest-flight-bug/truncated_name.png" onerror="this.setAttribute(&#39;data-error&#39;, 1)" alt="Using the truncated name allows me to apply the flight credits" loading="lazy" data-nuxt-img=""/>

Eventually I got on the line and after giving them all the information I already entered, listening to their spiel about how I can upgrade my ticket or book rental cars through them, and giving another human my credit card details over the phone, I was able to book my flight with the credits. I still don&#39;t understand how they were able to when I wasn&#39;t.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Southwest.com isn&#39;t open source <a href="https://www.preethamrn.com/posts/my-first-open-source-contribution/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><!--[-->unlike other applications I&#39;ve used<!--]--></a> so as much as I&#39;d like to, I can&#39;t fix it myself.
