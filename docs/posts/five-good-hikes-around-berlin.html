    <h1>Five good hikes around Berlin</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>Here are five good hikes, mostly about 10 or 15km long, each reachable with public transport, around Berlin.</p><h2 id="this-isnt-a-cooking-blog-but-youre-still-getting-the-preamble">this isn‚Äôt a cooking blog, but you‚Äôre still getting the preamble</h2><p>In late 2020 I made a <a href="https://capnfabs.net/posts/2020-its-over/#walking-as-a-way-of-life">habit of walking somewhere in nature</a> once a week. In October that year, a cascading set of planning failures meant that I was stuck in Berlin but very, very desperate to spend some time walking in the forest ‚Äì the original plan was to do a permaculture workshop in the mountains in Austria for a week, but then the borders closed. Then, the plan was to walk the <a href="https://www.schwarzwaldverein.de/schwarzwald/wanderwege/fernwanderwege/westweg">Schwarzwalder Westweg</a>, but a close friend needed me around after a jar fell off a shelf, landed on her foot and severed a tendon.</p><p>Anyway, cutting a long story short: I ended up stuck in Berlin. But it turns out there‚Äôs a lot of good nature around Berlin! I mean, just look at the map:</p><figure><img srcset="/posts/berlin-day-hikes/nature-park_hu4766783612505788657.png,

If you zoom in further, there‚Äôs a bunch of <em>smaller</em> protected areas too ‚ú®.</p><p>And so I found myself looking for ‚Äúhiking routes around Berlin‚Äù, which turned up the <a href="https://www.seenweg.de">66-Seen-Weg</a> (the ‚Äú66 lakes trail‚Äù), which apparently got eighth place in a 2006 poll for the most beautiful walking trails in Germany. That feels like a stretch to me, but it does have some good bits.</p><p>In the years since, I‚Äôve walked probably two-thirds of it. But also, once you‚Äôre on the trail, you start discovering <em>other</em> trails‚Ä¶ and over time, you start figuring out how to splice them together to make things that work really well for you.</p><p>Anyway I could talk about this kinda thing all day. Here are a few of my ‚Äústandard hikes‚Äù that I choose when I‚Äôm taking friends out for a walk. I‚Äôve done most of them in most seasons.</p><p>All of these are:</p><ul><li>Easily reachable by public transport (though, make sure to check for <em>Schienenersatzverkehr</em> / rail works and associated replacement services before you leave)</li><li>Doable in sneakers (shout out to Gil who used footwear as an excuse for not coming with us last weekend).</li><li>Extremely prone to mosquitos depending on the season. Bring repellant.</li></ul><h2 id="1-wensickendorf--birkenwerder">#1: Wensickendorf ‚Üí Birkenwerder</h2><p>This one has been reviewed as ‚Äúnothing compared to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturias">Asturias</a>, but I liked getting away from the Berlin chaos‚Äù, which honestly is about as good as you can do üëç</p><h3 id="why-i-like-it">Why I like it</h3><p>Lots of good forest. Minimal roads. Follows a river most of the way through the valley. Has a cool swampy river thing that feels kinda mystical. Good powerlines. I‚Äôve seen or heard woodpeckers every time I‚Äôve walked this route.</p><figure><img srcset="/posts/berlin-day-hikes/birkenwerder-1_hu8348389742730014310.jpg,

Very cute, cake / snacks / soup etc.</li><li><a href="http://briesekrug.de">Briesekrug</a> - beer garden.</li><li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/kanKpEQEXjfAXPHf6">Com Viet</a> - in Birkenwerder, at the end of the hike. A friend and I did this walk one Tuesday morning in Winter and stopped here for a bowl of pho on the way home. Nothing‚Äôs better than hot soup in cold weather.</li></ul><h3 id="getting-there-and-back">Getting there and back</h3><ul><li><strong>Getting there:</strong> S2 to Berlin-Karow + RB27 to Wensickendorf, approx every hour.</li><li><strong>Getting back:</strong> S1/S8 from Birkenwerder, approx every 20 mins.</li></ul><h2 id="2-melchow--eberswalde">#2: Melchow ‚Üí Eberswalde</h2><h3 id="why-i-like-it-1">Why I like it</h3><p>Melchow train station is very cute. High chance of sheep sighting. Good for <a href="https://capnfabs.net/posts/mushroom-studies-autumn-2020-brandenburg/">mushrooms</a>. A weird cobbled path / former road leading through a forest for part of it. Cool powerlines. A long stretch along a gorgeous river in a beech forest with lots of evidence of beaver activity.</p><figure><img srcset="/posts/berlin-day-hikes/melchow-3_hu13476993230621534113.jpg,

But:</p><ul><li><p>If you happen to just miss the train to Melchow, flipping the trail around might be a good idea (especially if the weather‚Äôs nice, there‚Äôs a nice sitting area at the Melchow train station).</p></li><li><p>If you‚Äôre walking on a Friday, it might make sense to start in Eberwalde and time it so that you arrive at <a href="https://www.melchhofg%C3%A4rtnerei.de">Melchhof G√§rtnerei</a> between 2:30p and 5pm so you can buy some vegetables directly from their farm. They also sell at the market in Prenzlauer Berg on Saturday and their vegetables are consistently delicious.</p></li></ul><h2 id="3-hangelsberg--bhf-fangschleuse">#3: Hangelsberg ‚Üí Bhf Fangschleuse</h2><h3 id="why-i-like-it-2">Why I like it</h3><p>Short and sweet, clocking in at 8km.</p><p>The first two kilometres start off a little gross / weird, along an oddly straight forest trail and then under an electricity corridoor.</p><p>But after that: walking through the L√∂cknitztal is really beautiful ‚Äì small trails, lots of diverse vegetation.</p><p>Along the way, you walk past <a href="https://klein-wall.de">Forellenanlage Klein Wall</a>, which sells smoked trout.</p><p>I‚Äôve done this a number of times as a mushrooming / short walk combo expedition. You could easily extend it further towards Erkner or all the way to R√ºdersdorf along the <a href="https://www.seenweg.de/ruedersdorf.html">66-Seen-Weg</a> (<a href="https://www.wildganz.com/fernwanderweg/66-seen-wanderweg-etappe-9">more info + GPX track</a>) if you felt like walking further.</p><figure><img srcset="/posts/berlin-day-hikes/loecknitz_hu12597686251817692669.jpg,

It‚Äôs also in <a href="https://milchundmoos.de/buch/">Milch &amp; Moos</a>, a book about hiking and good food in Brandenburg.</li><li>It‚Äôs significantly longer than the other recommendations on this list, at ~24km.</li><li>I‚Äôve only done it once so far. lol.</li></ul><p>I <em>did</em> really enjoy it, it‚Äôs just a bit more painful to get to. It‚Äôs on this list so that I remember that it exists and think to walk it next time I head out. Stay tuned üëÄ</p><p>There‚Äôs <a href="https://www.wildganz.com/fernwanderweg/66-seen-wanderweg-etappe-11">more details and the route here</a>.</p><figure><img srcset="/posts/berlin-day-hikes/bad-saarow-1_hu678689315275703488.jpg,

It‚Äôs one of my favourite walks. This is basically a riff on the <a href="https://www.berlin.de/sen/uvk/natur-und-gruen/landschaftsplanung/gruene-hauptwege/die-wege-im-ueberblick/artikel.930343.php">Pankeweg</a>, and it‚Äôs the sort of thing where you can look out the window, notice that the weather is beautiful and just go without much prep or thinking.</p><h3 id="why-i-like-it-3">Why I like it</h3><ul><li>Infinite good coffee options</li><li>Cherry-blossoms (in Spring)</li><li>Surprising number of nice parks, plus one nice graveyard</li><li>Along a river / creek.</li></ul><p>I have the feeling it‚Äôd be a nice walk to show visitors part of the city aside from all the usual tourist stuff. But it does still go past Mauerpark.</p><h3 id="food--amenities-2">Food / Amenities</h3><p>Loads of options the whole way along the path. My standard stopping-in points are:</p><ul><li>Coffee: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/pyLLQFXZnFiRx4Rf8">Kiez Kaffee Kraft</a>, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Mc7maX2ELE4ycoiFA">Bonanza Coffee Heroes</a></li><li>Conveniently-placed snacks / cake / bathrooms after the park: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZbGhb82R7aP5mwBv9">EFEU</a></li><li><a href="https://www.spsg.de/schloesser-gaerten/objekt/schloss-schoenhausen">Schloss Sch√∂nhausen</a> - nice gardens; it‚Äôs worth doing a loop.
