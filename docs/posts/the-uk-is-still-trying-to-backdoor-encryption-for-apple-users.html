The only change </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/uks-demands-apple-break-encryption-emergency-us-all"><span>since the last time</span></a><span> they demanded this is that the order is allegedly limited to only apply to British users. That doesn’t make it any better.</span></p>
<p><span>The demand uses a power called a “Technical Capability Notice” (TCN) in the U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Act. </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/investigatory-powers-bill-and-apple"><span>At the time of its signing</span></a><span> we noted this law would likely be used to demand Apple spy on its users. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>After the U.K. government first issued the TCN in January, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/cornered-uks-demand-encryption-backdoor-apple-turns-its-strongest-security-setting"><span>Apple was forced</span></a><span> to either create a backdoor or block its </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-encrypt-your-iphone"><span>Advanced Data Protection</span></a><span> feature—which turns on end-to-end encryption for iCloud—for all U.K. users. The company decided to remove the feature in the U.K. instead of creating the backdoor.</span></p>
<p><span>The initial order from January targeted the data of </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> Apple users. In August, the </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-spy-chief-gabbard-says-uk-agreed-drop-backdoor-mandate-apple-2025-08-19/"><span>US claimed the U.K. withdrew the demand</span></a><span>, but Apple did not re-enable Advanced Data Protection. The new order provides insight into why: the U.K. was just rewriting it to only apply to British users. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>This is still an unsettling overreach that makes U.K. users less safe and less free. As we’ve said</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/clipper-chips-birthday-looking-back-22-years-key-escrow-failures"> <span>time</span></a><span> and</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption"> <span>time again</span></a><span>,</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/salt-typhoon-hack-shows-theres-no-security-backdoor-thats-only-good-guys"> <span>any backdoor built for the government</span></a><span> puts everyone at greater risk of hacking, identity theft, and fraud. It sets a dangerous precedent to demand similar data from other companies, and provides a runway for other authoritarian governments to issue comparable orders. The news of continued server-side access to users&#39; data comes just days after the UK government announced an </span><a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/id-cards-uk-risks-sleeping-walking-into-pre-crime-state/"><span>intrusive mandatory digital ID scheme</span></a><span>, framed as a measure against illegal migration.</span></p>
<p><span>A tribunal hearing was initially set to </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c740r0m4mzjo"><span>take place in January 2026</span></a><span>, though it’s currently unclear if that will proceed or if the new order changes the legal process. Apple must continue to refuse these types of backdoors. Breaking end-to-end encryption for one country breaks it for everyone. These repeated attempts to weaken encryption violates</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/european-court-human-rights-confirms-undermining-encryption-violates-fundamental"> <span>fundamental human rights</span></a><span> and destroys our right to private spaces.</span></p>
