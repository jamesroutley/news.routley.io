    <h1>Tool Building: Becoming a Better Writer</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>When I studied art, I would copy the drawings of the great Renaissance masters like Michaelangelo and Da Vinci.</p>



<p>When I work on my writing, sometimes imitate the style of certain writers like Hemingway or Byron.</p>



<p>Around 13 years ago I had the idea to create an application that would record how people copy a piece of writing.</p>



<p>The application would let you:</p>



<p>– access a work of literature (via <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gutenberg</a>)</p>



<p>– see that work in one pane of the application</p>



<p>– in another pane, you type whatever you are copying</p>



<p>– record the timestamp and keystroke and this becomes a “score”</p>



<p>With the score we can:</p>



<p>– playback the writing as the person wrote it (animated) not only the static end product</p>



<p>– interpret as a musical score and map letters or times to notes</p>



<p>– create a film or animation maybe using stable diffusion</p>



<p>– compare how different people type the same manuscript</p>



<p>– understand our writing habits</p>



<p>– other things ? ideas wanted</p>



<p>How quickly do I write certain words or letters? How often do I mistype the letter ‘y’?</p>



<p>We lose these gestures when we only look at the finished piece. Lets treat writing as a performance.</p>



<h2 id="h-writing-as-gesture-is-alive-for-me-today-so-i-went-back-to-rebuild-the-application">Writing as Gesture is alive for me today so I went back to rebuild the application</h2>



<p><strong>The Design and Architecture</strong></p>



<p>There are two modes: writing and playback. Writing mode captures the user, the piece, the keystroke, and the timestamp of the keystroke. I want to capture the data as a log file, but I am using a database for now.</p>



<p>I do not have the concept of an ending. A piece of writing never ends. Each user only has one version of a piece: you can only copy Moby Dick once or recopy it over and over in the same document.</p>



<p>Anyone can write a playback mode since the protocol is public: user, piece, keystroke, timestamp. My first playback mode will probably be straightforward playback, but I may change the colors of the letters depending on how many times they were erased or how long it took the user to write them.</p>



<p><strong>The Stack</strong></p>



<p>I am using preact (typescript) and the front end and python on the backend since they are both languages I am familiar with. Preact is new for me, but react is old for me.</p>



<p>I am hosting with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://repl.it/">Replit</a>. I use <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://repl.it/">Replit</a> when I teach Python (last at CUNY). I also use Replit with my kids for <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://superhi.com/">superhi</a> classes. They have great templates, integration with git, and free hosting, and it takes zero time to set up.</p>



<p>Maybe I’ll move it over to a cloud service provider eventually. I do have some shame that I am not using a CPS, Docker, k8 etc – but not much.</p>



<p><strong>The Hardest Thing</strong></p>



<p>Sometimes the hardest part is just getting started and putting up a blank screen – so I did that <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://timewriter.hackerm0m.repl.co/">https://timewriter.hackerm0m.repl.co/</a>.</p>



<p>Hopefully, I can move on to the next steps soon.</p>
