    <h1>Show HN: TailGuard – Bridge your WireGuard router into Tailscale via a container</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">A simple Docker container app which allows connecting existing WireGuard
servers to the Tailscale network, in case the device running WireGuard is
locked in and/or does not support Tailscale binaries.</p>
<p dir="auto">The network topology will look roughly like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="  +---------+
  | device1 |\
  +---------+ \                      VPS
  +---------+  \ +---------+    +-----------+      +-----------+
  | device2 |----| tailnet |----| TailGuard |&lt;----&gt;| WireGuard |
  +---------+  / +---------+    +-----------+      +-----------+
  +---------+ /
  | device3 |/
  +---------+"><pre><code>  +---------+
  | device1 |\
  +---------+ \                      VPS
  +---------+  \ +---------+    +-----------+      +-----------+
  | device2 |----| tailnet |----| TailGuard |&lt;----&gt;| WireGuard |
  +---------+  / +---------+    +-----------+      +-----------+
  +---------+ /
  | device3 |/
  +---------+
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">As usual, the tailnet is virtual and in reality connections are point-to-point,
but all connections to WireGuard are tunneled through the TailGuard server with
a fixed and persistent connection. As long as you have access to a server as
close to the WireGuard server as possible (ideally with a minimal ping), for
example a VPS, you can connect any WireGuard device to your tailnet.</p>

<p dir="auto">Why would you want to do this? For most use cases it may be easier to connect
your device with WireGuard directly, but there are a couple of benefits with
this bridged approach:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>the WireGuard tunnel private key is stored only on a single machine, making
the key management less work</li>
<li>if you have a new device, you can simply log in to your tailnet with SSO,
without having to transfer keys</li>
<li>it&#39;s easier to switch between exit nodes in your tailnet, without having to
reconnect to different VPNs</li>
<li>you can have access to both your tailnet and WireGuard concurrently on your
mobile device, which doesn&#39;t support multiple VPNs</li>
<li>you can connect your home network to your tailnet using your router, which
only supports WireGuard but not Tailscale</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">The simplest way to start TailGuard is to simply download a WireGuard client
config and save it as <code>wg0.conf</code>. After that you can create an IPv6 network
(optional, but recommended) and start the container:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker network create --ipv6 ip6net
docker run -it \
  -v ./wg0.conf:/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf -v ./state:/tailguard/state \
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN --device /dev/net/tun \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1 \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1 \
  --network ip6net -p 41641:41641/udp \
  --name tailguard juhovh/tailguard:latest"><pre><code>docker network create --ipv6 ip6net
docker run -it \
  -v ./wg0.conf:/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf -v ./state:/tailguard/state \
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN --device /dev/net/tun \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1 \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1 \
  --network ip6net -p 41641:41641/udp \
  --name tailguard juhovh/tailguard:latest
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Docker will print you an URL where you need to log in to your tailnet, and after
that you should be good to go.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to build the latest version of the image yourself, it might be best
to use <code>docker compose</code>. In that case you should store the <code>wg0.conf</code> file under
<code>config/</code>, build the latest image with <code>docker compose build</code> and finally run it
with <code>docker compose up</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">That&#39;s it, happy networking!</p>

<p dir="auto">Let&#39;s imagine you have a WireGuard server running on 10.1.0.1 that is able to
accept any routes, and its local LAN network is 192.168.8.0/24. You have already
downloaded the WireGuard client config for this tunnel and saved it.  Make sure
that the subnet 192.168.8.0/24 is explicitly mentioned in the AllowedIPs section
in addition to 0.0.0.0/0, for TailGuard to pick it up. It should look something
like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[Interface]
PrivateKey = &lt;REDACTED&gt;
Address = 10.1.0.2/24,fd00:ed7c:a960:6e9b::2/64
DNS = 10.1.0.1,fd00:ed7c:a960:6e9b::1
MTU = 1420

[Peer]
PublicKey = &lt;REDACTED&gt;
PresharedKey = &lt;REDACTED&gt;
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0, 192.168.8.0/24
Endpoint = &lt;REDACTED&gt;:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25"><pre><code>[Interface]
PrivateKey = &lt;REDACTED&gt;
Address = 10.1.0.2/24,fd00:ed7c:a960:6e9b::2/64
DNS = 10.1.0.1,fd00:ed7c:a960:6e9b::1
MTU = 1420

[Peer]
PublicKey = &lt;REDACTED&gt;
PresharedKey = &lt;REDACTED&gt;
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0, 192.168.8.0/24
Endpoint = &lt;REDACTED&gt;:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Next you can either add <code>-e TS_DEST_IP=10.1.0.1</code> if running directly, or open
the docker-compose.yml and modify it as follows:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    environment:
      - TS_DEST_IP=10.1.0.1"><pre><code>    environment:
      - TS_DEST_IP=10.1.0.1
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will use the device wg0 and therefore the wg0.conf file for WireGuard. It
will connect to the tailnet, forward all connections targeting itself to the
router behind the tunnel, advertise the &#34;192.168.8.0/24&#34; route to other tailnet
hosts, advertise itself as an exit node, and authenticate with the given
authkey.</p>
<p dir="auto">Supported configuration parameters through environment:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>WG_DEVICE</code> - WireGuard device name, must be valid and match config file name (<strong>default:</strong> wg0)</li>
<li><code>TS_DEVICE</code> - Tailscale device name, must be a valid device name (<strong>default:</strong> tailscale0)</li>
<li><code>TS_PORT</code> - Tailscale port number, should be exposed by Docker (<strong>default:</strong> 41641)</li>
<li><code>TS_AUTHKEY</code> - Tailscale auth key for authentication if used</li>
<li><code>TS_DEST_IP</code> - Destination IP to route Tailscale traffic to</li>
<li><code>TS_HOSTNAME</code> - Tailscale hostname for this device if used</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Unlike Tailscale, WireGuard itself does not handle any routing. Therefore, the
WireGuard subnets and routes are automatically advertised on the Tailscale
network, but it doesn&#39;t work the other way around.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let&#39;s say your TailGuard node has IP addresses <code>10.1.0.2</code> and
<code>fd00:ed7c:a960:6e9b::2</code> for the WireGuard tunnel, like in the above config. You
likely want to add at least routes <code>100.64.0.0/10</code> and <code>fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48</code>
(Tailscale private address spaces) to be routed through <code>10.1.0.2</code>. You can do
this with something along the lines of:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="ip route add 100.64.0.0/10 via 10.1.0.2 dev wgserver
ip route add fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48 via fd00:ed7c:a960:6e9b::2 dev wgserver"><pre><code>ip route add 100.64.0.0/10 via 10.1.0.2 dev wgserver
ip route add fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48 via fd00:ed7c:a960:6e9b::2 dev wgserver
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you have additional subnets in your tailnet (e.g. <code>192.168.1.0/24</code>) that
you&#39;d like to access, just add similar routing rules for those. TailGuard should
take care of forwarding all the published subnets to the tailnet, as long as it
is able to receive packets through the WireGuard tunnel first.</p>
