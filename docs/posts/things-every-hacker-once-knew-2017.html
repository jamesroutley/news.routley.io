    <h1>Things Every Hacker Once Knew (2017)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<div id="preamble">
<div>
<p>One fine day in January 2017 I was reminded of something I had
half-noticed a few times over the previous decade.  That is, younger
hackers don’t know the bit structure of ASCII and the meaning of the
odder control characters in it.</p>
<p>This is knowledge every fledgling hacker used to absorb through their
pores. It’s nobody’s fault this changed; the obsolescence of hardware
terminals and the near-obsolescence of the RS-232 protocol is what did
it. Tools generate culture; sometimes, when a tool becomes obsolete, a
bit of cultural commonality quietly evaporates.  It can be difficult
to notice that this has happened.</p>
<p>This document began as a collection of facts about ASCII and related
technologies, notably hardware serial terminals and RS-232 and
modems. This is lore that was at one time near-universal and is no
longer.  It’s not likely to be directly useful today - until you trip
over some piece of still-functioning technology where it’s relevant
(like a GPS puck), or it makes sense of some old-fart war story.  Even
so, it’s good to know anyway, for cultural-literacy reasons.</p>
<p>One thing this collection has that tends to be indefinite in the minds
of older hackers is <em>calendar dates</em>. Those of us who lived through
all this tend to have remembered order and dependencies but not exact
timing; here, I did the research to pin a lot of that down.  I’ve
noticed that people have a tendency to retrospectively back-date the
technologies that interest them, so even if you did live through the
era it describes you might get a few surprises from reading this.</p>
<p>There are lots of references to Unix in here because I am mainly
attempting to educate younger open-source hackers working on
Unix-derived systems such as Linux and the BSDs. If those terms mean
nothing to you, the rest of this document probably won’t either.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="_hardware_context">Hardware context</h2>
<div>
<p>Nowadays, when two computers talk to each other, it’s usually via
TCP/IP over some physical layer you seldom need to care much about.
And a &#34;terminal&#34; is actually a &#34;terminal emulator&#34;, a piece of
software that manages part of a bit-mapped display and itself speaks
TCP/IP.</p>
<p>Before ubiquitous TCP/IP and bit-mapped displays things were very
different. For most hackers that transition took place within a
few years of 1992 - perhaps somewhat earlier if you had access to
then-expensive workstation hardware.</p>
<p>Before then there were video display terminals - VDTs for short. In
the mid-1970s these had displaced an earlier generation of printing
terminals derived from <strong>really</strong> old technology called a &#34;teletype&#34;,
which had evolved around 1900 from Victorian telegraph networks.  The
very earliest versions of Unix in the late 1960s were written for
these printing terminals, in particular for the Teletype Model 33 (aka
ASR-33); the &#34;tty&#34; that shows up in Unix device names was a
then-common abbreviation for &#34;teletype&#34;.</p>
<p>(This is not the only Unix device name that is a fossil from a bygone
age.  There’s also /dev/lp for the system default printer; every
hacker once knew that the &#34;lp&#34; stood for &#34;line printer&#34;, a type of
line-at-a-time electromechanical printer associated with mainframe
computers of roughly the same vintage as the ASR-33.)</p>
<p>One legacy of those printing terminals is the &#34;Carriage return&#34;
character (Ctrl-r, or &#34;\\r&#34; expressed as a C string escape), so called
because it moved the print head to the left hand end of the line.
Unix dispensed with it, using a bare line feed (Ctrl-N or &#34;\\n&#34;) as an
end-of-line marker.  Many other operating systems still use \r\n.  The
reason it’s \r\n rather than the \n\r that the \r actually took more
than one normal chaacter-transmission time to execute on some of the
earliest hardware; you had to do it first so it could finish as the \n
was being performed.</p>
<p>It’s half-forgotten now that these VDTs were deployed in fleets
attached to large central machines.  Today a single personal computer
has multiple processors, but back then all the VDTs and their
users on a machine divided up a single processor; this was called
&#34;timesharing&#34;. Modern Unixes still have this capability, if anyone
still cared to use it; the typical setup of having many &#34;virtual
terminals&#34;, accessible by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Fsomething, uses the very
mechanism that originally provided access to many terminals for
timesharing.</p>
<p>In those pre-Internet days computers didn’t talk to each other much,
and the way teletypes and terminals talked to computers was a hardware
protocol called &#34;RS-232&#34; (or, if you’re being pedantic, &#34;EIA RS-232C&#34;).
  Before USB, when people spoke of a &#34;serial&#34; link,
they meant RS-232, and sometimes referred to the equipment that spoke
it as &#34;serial terminals&#34;.</p>
<p>RS-232 had a very long service life; it was developed in the early
1960s, not originally for computer use but as a way for
teletypewriters to talk to modems.  Though it has passed out of
general use and is no longer common knowledge, it’s not quite dead
even today.</p>
<p>I’ve been simplifying a bit here.  There were other things besides
RS-232 and serial terminals going on, notably on IBM mainframes.  But
they’ve left many fewer traces in current technology and its folklore.
This is because the lineage of modern Unix passes back through a
now-forgotten hardware category called a &#34;minicomputer&#34;, especially
minicomputers made by the Digital Equipment Corporation.  ASCII,
RS-232 and serial terminals were part of the technology cluster around
minicomputers - as was, for that matter, Unix itself.</p>
<p>Minicomputers were wiped out by workstations and workstations by
descendants of the IBM PC, but many hackers old enough to remember the
minicomputer era (mid-1960s to mid-1980s) tend still to get a bit
misty-eyed about the DEC hardware they cut their teeth on.</p>
<p>Often, however, nostalgia obscures how very underpowered those
machines were. For example: a DEC VAX 11-780 minicomputer in the
mid-1980s, used for timesharing and often supporting a dozen
simultaneous users, had less than 1/1000 the processing power and
less than 1/5000 times as much storage available as a low-end
smartphone does in 2017.</p>
<p>In fact, until well into the 1980s microcomputers ran slowly enough
(and had poor enough RF shielding) that <strong>this</strong> was common knowledge:
you could put an AM radio next to one and get a clue when it was doing
something unusual, because either fundamentals or major subharmonics
of the clock frequencies were in the 20Hz to 20KHz range of human
audibility.  Nothing has run <strong>that</strong> slowly since the turn of the 21st
century.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_strange_afterlife_of_the_hayes_smartmodem">The strange afterlife of the Hayes smartmodem</h2>
<div>
<p>About those modems: the word is a portmanteau for
&#34;modulator/demodulator&#34;.  Modems allowed digital signals to pass over
copper phone wires - ridiculously slowly by today’s standards, but
that’s how we did our primitive wide-area networking in pre-Internet
times.  It was <strong>not</strong> generally known back then that modems had first
been invented in the late 1950s for use in military communications,
notably the SAGE air-defense network; we just took them for granted.</p>
<p>Today modems that speak over copper or optical fiber are embedded
invisibly in the Internet access point in your basement; other
varieties perform over-the-air signal handling for smartphones and
tablets.  A variety every hacker used to know about (and most of us
owned) was the &#34;outboard&#34; modem, a separate box wired to your computer
and your telephone line.</p>
<p>Inboard modems (expansion cards for your computer) were also known
(and became widespread on consumer-grade computers towards the end of
the modem era), but hackers avoided them because being located inside
the case made them vulnerable to RF noise, and the blinkenlights on an
outboard were useful for diagnosing problems.  Also, most hackers
learned to interpret (at least to some extent) modem song - the

outboards made while attempting to establish a connection. The
happy song of a successful connect was identifiably different from
various sad songs of synchronization failure.</p>
<p>One relic of modem days is the name of the Unix SIGHUP signal,
indicating that the controlling terminal of the user’s process has
disconnected.  HUP stands for &#34;HangUP&#34; and this originally indicated
a serial line drop (specifically, loss of Data Carrier Detect)
as produced by a modem hangup.</p>
<p>These old-fashioned modems were, by today’s standards, unbelievably
slow.  Modem speeds increased from 110 bits per second back at the
beginning of interactive computing to 56 kilobits per second just
before the technology was effectively wiped out by wide-area Internet
around the end of the 1990s, which brought in speeds of a megabit per
second and more (20 times faster).  For the longest stable period of
modem technology after 1970, about 1984 to 1991, typical speed was
9600bps. This has left some traces; it’s why surviving serial-protocol
equipment tends to default to a speed of 9600bps.</p>
<p>There was a line of modems called &#34;Hayes Smartmodems&#34; that could be
told to dial a number, or set parameters such as line speed, with
command codes sent to the modem over its serial link from the machine.
Every hacker used to know the &#34;AT&#34; prefix used for commands and that,
for example, ATDT followed by a phone number would dial the number.
Other modem manufacturers copied the Hayes command set and variants of
it became near universal after 1981.</p>
<p>What was <strong>not</strong> commonly known then is that the &#34;AT&#34; prefix had a
helpful special property.  That bit sequence (1+0 1000 0010 1+0
0010 1010 1+, where the plus suffix indicates one or more repetitions
of the preceding bit) has a shape that makes it as easy as possible
for a receiver to recognize it even if the receiver doesn’t know the
transmit-line speed; this, in turn, makes it possible to automatically
synchronize to that speed .</p>
<p>That property is still useful, and thus in 2017 the AT
convention has survived in some interesting places.  AT commands have
been found to perform control functions on 3G and 4G cellular modems
used in smartphones.  On one widely deployed variety, &#34;AT+QLINUXCMD=&#34;
is a prefix that passes commands to an instance of Linux running in
firmware on the chip itself (separately from whatever OS might be
running visibly on the phone).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_preserving_core_values">Preserving core values</h2>
<div>
<p>From about 1955 to 1975 - before semiconductor memory - the dominant
technology in computer memory used tiny magnetic doughnuts strung
on copper wires.  The doughnuts were known as &#34;ferrite cores&#34; and
main memory thus known as &#34;core memory&#34; or &#34;core&#34;.</p>
<p>Unix terminology was formed in the early 1970s, and compounds like
&#34;in core&#34; and &#34;core dump&#34; survived into the semiconductor era.
Until as late as around 1990 it could still be assumed that every
hacker knew from where these terms derived; even microcomputer
hackers for which memory had always been semiconductor RAM tended
to pick up this folklore rapidly on contact with Unix.</p>
<p>After 2000, however, as multiprocessor systems became increasingly
common even on desktops, &#34;core&#34; increasingly took on a conflicting
meaning as shorthand for &#34;processor core&#34;. In 2017 &#34;core&#34; can still
mean either thing, but the reason for the older usage is no longer
generally understood and idioms like &#34;in core&#34; may be fading.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_36_bit_machines_and_the_persistence_of_octal">36-bit machines and the persistence of octal</h2>
<div>
<p>There’s a power-of-two size hierarchy in memory units that we now
think of as normal - 8 bit bytes, 16 or 32 or 64-bit words.  But this
did not become effectively universal until after 1983. There was an
earlier tradition of designing computer architectures with 36-bit
words.</p>
<p>There was a time when 36-bit machines loomed large in hacker folklore and
some of the basics about them were ubiquitous common knowledge, though
cultural memory of this era began to fade in the early 1990s.  Two of
the best-known 36-bitters were the DEC PDP-10 and the Symbolics 3600
Lisp machine.  The cancellation of the PDP-10 in &#39;83 proved to be
the death knell for this class of machine, though the 3600 fought
a rear-guard action for a decade afterwards.</p>
<p>Hexadecimal is a natural way to represent raw memory contents on
machines with the power-of-two size hierarchy. But octal (base-8)
representations of machine words were common on 36-bit machines,
related to the fact that a 36-bit word naturally divides into 12 3-bit
fields naturally represented as octal.  In fact, back then we
generally assumed you could tell which of the 32- or 36-bit phyla a
machine belonged in by whether you could see digits greater than 7 in
a memory dump.</p>
<p>Here are a few things every hacker used to know that related to
these machines:</p>
<div><ul>
<li>
<p>
36 bits was long enough to represent positive and negative integers
  to an accuracy of ten decimal digits, as was expected on mechanical
  calculators of the era. Standardization on 32 bits was
  unsuccessfully resisted by numerical analysts and people in
  scientific computing, who really missed that last 4 bits of accuracy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A &#34;character&#34; might be 9 bits on these machines, with 4 packed to a
  word. Consequently, keyboards designed for them might have both a meta key
  to assert bit 8 and a now-extinct extra modifier key (usually but
  not always called &#34;Super&#34;) that asserted bit 9.  Sometimes this
  selected a tier of non-ASCII characters including Greek letters
  and mathematical symbols.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Alternatively, 6-bit characters might be packed 6 to a word. There
  were many different 6-bit character encodings; not only did they
  differ across a single manufacturer’s machines, but some individual
  machines used multiple incompatible encodings.  This is why older
  non-Unix minicomputers like the PDP-10 had a six-character limit on
  filenames - this allowed an entire filename to be packed in a single
  36-bit word.  If you ever see the following acronyms it is a clue
  that you may have wandered into this swamp: SIXBIT, FIELDATA,
  RADIX-50, BCDIC.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>It used also to be generally known that 36-bit architectures explained
some unfortunate features of the C language. The original Unix
machine, the PDP-7, featured 18-bit words corresponding to half-words
on larger 36-bit computers.  These were more naturally represented as
six octal (3-bit) digits.</p>
<p>The immediate ancestor of C was an interpreted language written on the
PDP-7 and named B. In it, a numeric literal beginning with 0 was
interpreted as octal.</p>
<p>The PDP-7’s successor, and the first workhorse Unix machine was the
PDP-11 (first shipped in 1970). It had 16-bit words - but, due to some
unusual peculiarities of the instruction set, octal made more sense
for its machine code as well.  C, first implemented on the PDP-11,
thus inherited the B octal syntax.  And extended it: when an in-string
backslash has a following digit, that was expected to lead an octal
literal.</p>
<p>The Interdata 32, VAX, and other later Unix platforms didn’t have
those peculiarities; their opcodes expressed more naturally in hex.
But C was never adjusted to prefer hex, and the surprising
interpretation of leading 0 wasn’t removed.</p>
<p>Because many later languages (Java, Python, etc) copied C’s low-level
lexical rules for compatibility reasons, the relatively useless and
sometimes dangerous octal syntax besets computing platforms for which
three-bit opcode fields are wildly inappropriate, and may never be
entirely eradicated .</p>
<p>The PDP-11 was so successful that architectures strongly influenced by
it (notably, including Intel  and ARM microprocessors) eventually took over the
world, killing off 36-bit machines.</p>
<p>The x86 instruction set actually kept the property that though
descriptions of its opcodes commonly use hex, large parts of the
instructiion set are best understood as three-bit fields and
thus best expressed in octal. This is perhaps clearest in the
encoding of the mov instruction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_rs232_and_its_discontents">RS232 and its discontents</h2>
<div>
<p>A TCP/IP link generally behaves like a clean stream of 8-bit bytes
(formally, octets). You get your data as fast as the network can run,
and error detection/correction is done somewhere down below the layer
you can see.</p>
<p>RS-232 was not like that. Two devices speaking it had to agree on a
common line speed - also on how the byte framing works (the latter is
why you’ll see references to &#34;stop bits&#34; in related documentation).
Finally, error detection and correction was done in-stream, sort of.
RS232 devices almost always spoke ASCII, and used the fact that ASCII
only filled 7 bits.  The top bit might be, but was not always, used as
a parity bit for error detection. If not used, the top bit could carry
data.</p>
<p>You had to set your equipment at both ends for a specific combination
of all of these.  After about 1984 anything other than &#34;8N1&#34; - eight
bits, no parity, one stop bit - became increasingly rare.  Before
that, all kinds of weird combinations were in use. Even parity (&#34;E&#34;)
was more common than odd (&#34;O&#34;) and 1 stop bit more common than 2
, but
you could see anything come down a wire.  And if you weren’t properly
set up for it, all you got was &#34;baud barf&#34; - random 8-bit garbage
rather than the character data you were expecting.</p>
<p>This, in particular, is one reason the API for the POSIX/Unix
terminal interface, termios(3), has a lot of complicated options with
no obvious modern-day function. It had to be able to manipulate all
these settings, and more.</p>
<p>Another consequence was that passing binary data over an RS-232 link
wouldn’t work if parity was enabled - the high bits would get
clobbered. Other now-forgotten wide-area network protocols reacted
even worse, treating in-band characters with 0x80 on as control codes
with results ranging from amusing to dire.  We had a term, &#34;8-bit
clean&#34;, for networks and software that didn’t clobber the 0x80 bit.
And we <strong>needed</strong> that term…</p>
<p>The fragility of the 0x80 bit back in those old days is the now
largely forgotten reason that the MIME encoding for email was invented
(and within it the well-known MIME64 encoding). Even the version of
SMTP current as I write (RFC 5321) is still essentially a 7-bit
protocol, though modern end points can now optionally negotiate
passing 8-bit data.</p>
<p>But before MIME there was uuencode/uudecode, a pair of filters for
rendering 8-bit data in 7 bits that is still occasionally used today
in Unixland. In this century uuencoding has largely been replaced by
MIME64, but there are places you can still trip over uuencoded binary
archives.</p>
<p>Even the RS-232 physical connector varied.  Standard RS-232 as defined in
1962 used a roughly D-shaped shell with 25 physical pins (DB-25), way
more than the physical protocol actually required (you can support a
minimal version with just three wires, and this was actually
common). Twenty years later, after the IBM PC-AT introduced it in
1984, most manufacturers switched to using a smaller DB-9 connector
(which is technically a DE-9 but almost nobody ever called it that).
If you look at a PC with a serial port it is most likely to be a DB-9;
confusingly, DB-25 came to be used for printer parallel ports (which
originally had a very different connector) before those too were
obsolesced by USB and Ethernet.</p>
<p>Anybody who worked with this stuff had to keep around a bunch of
specialized hardware - gender changers, DB-25-to-DB-9 adapters (and
the reverse), breakout boxes, null modems, and other gear I won’t
describe in detail because it’s left almost no traces in today’s tech.
Hackers of a certain age still tend to have these things cluttering
their toolboxes or gathering dust in a closet somewhere.</p>
<p>The main reason to still care about any of this (other than
understanding greybeard war stories) is that some kinds of sensor and
control equipment and IoT devices still speak RS-232, increasingly
often wrapped inside a USB emulation.  The most common devices that do
the latter are probably GPS sensors designed to talk to computers (as
opposed to handheld GPSes or car-navigation systems).</p>
<p>Because of devices like GPSes, you may still occasionally need to know
what an RS-232 &#34;handshake line&#34; is.  These were originally used to
communicate with modems; a terminal, for example, could change the
state of the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) line to indicate that it was
ready to receive, initiate, or continue a modem session.</p>
<p>Later, handshake lines were used for other equipment-specific kinds of
out-of-band signals.  The most commonly re-used lines were DCD (data
carrier detect) and RI (Ring Indicator).</p>
<p>Three-wire versions of RS-232 omitted these handshake lines
entirely. A chronic source of frustration was equipment at one end of
your link that failed to supply an out-of-band signal that the
equipment at the other end needed.  The modern version of this is
GPSes that fail to supply their 1PPS (a high-precision top-of-second
pulse) over one of the handshake lines.</p>
<p>Even when your hardware generated and received handshake signals, you
couldn’t necessarily trust cables to pass them. Cheap cables often
failed to actually connect all 25 (or 9) leads end-to-end.  Then there
were &#34;crossover&#34; or &#34;null modem&#34; cables, which for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_modem">reasons too painful to go
into here</a> crosswired the transmit and receive lines. Of course none
of these variants were reliably labeled, so debugging an RS232 link
with a random cable pulled out of a box often involved a lot of
profanity.</p>
<p>Another significant problem was that an RS-232 device not actually
sending data was undetectable without analog-level monitoring
equipment. You couldn’t tell a working but silent device from one that
had come unplugged or suffered a connection fault in its wiring.  This
caused no end of complications when troubleshooting and is a major
reason USB was able to displace RS-232 after 1994.</p>
<p>A trap for the unwary that opened up after about the year 2000 is that
peripheral connectors labeled RS232 could have one of two different
sets of voltage levels. If they’re pins or sockets in a DB9 or DB25
shell, the voltage swing between 1 and 0 bits can be as much as 50
volts, and is usually about 26.  Bare connectors on a circuit board,
or chip pins, increasingly came to use what’s called &#34;TTL serial&#34; -
same signalling with a swing of 3.3 or (less often) 5 volts. You can’t
wire standard RS232 to TTL serial directly; the link needs a device
called a &#34;level shifter&#34;.  If you connect without one, components on
the TTL side will get fried.</p>
<p>RS-232 passed out of common knowledge in the mid- to late 1990s, but
didn’t finally disappear from general-purpose computers until around
2010.  Standard RS-232 is still widely used not just in the niche
applications previously mentioned, but also in point-of-sale systems
diagnostic consoles on commercial-grade routers, and debugging
consoles on embedded systems. The TTL serial variant is often used
in the latter context, especially on maker devices.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_wan_time_gone_the_forgotten_pre_internets">WAN time gone: The forgotten pre-Internets</h2>
<div>
<p>Today, the TCP/IP Internet is very nearly the only WAN
(Wide-Area-Network) left standing. It was not always so.  From the
late &#39;70s to the mid-1990s - but especially between 1981 and 1991 -
there were a profusion of WANs of widely varying capability.  You are
most likely to trip over references to these in email archives from
that time; one characteristic of it is that people sometimes
advertised multiple different network addresses in their signatures.</p>
<p>Every hacker over a certain age remembers either UUCP or the BBS
scene. Many participated in both. In those days access to the
&#34;real&#34; net (ARPANET, which became Internet) was difficult if you
weren’t affiliated with one of a select group of federal agencies,
military contractors, or university research labs. So we made do
with what we had, which was modems and the telephone network.</p>
<p>UUCP stands for Unix to Unix Copy Program.  Between its escape from
Bell Labs in 1979 and the mass-market Internet explosion of the
mid-1990s, it provided slow but very low-cost networking
among Unix sites using modems and the phone network.</p>
<p>UUCP was a store-and-forward system originally intended for
propagating software updates, but its major users rapidly became email
and a thing called USENET (launched 1981) that was the ur-ancestor of
Stack Overflow and other modern web fora.  It supported topic groups
for messages which, propagated from their point of origin through
UUCP, would eventually flood to the whole network.</p>
<p>In part, UUCP and USENET were a hack around the two-tier rate
structure that then existed for phone calls, with &#34;local&#34; being
flat-rate monthly and &#34;long-distance&#34; being expensively metered by the
minute. UUCP traffic could be relayed across long distances by local
hops.</p>
<p>A direct descendant of USENET still exists, as Google Groups
, but was
much more central to the hacker culture before cheap Internet. Open
source as we now know it germinated in USENET groups dedicated to
sharing source code.  Several conventions still in use today, like
having project metadata files named README and NEWS and INSTALL,
became established there in the early 1980s - though at least README
was older, having been seen in the wild back on the PDP-10.</p>
<p>Two key dates in USENET history were universally known.  One was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Renaming">Great Renaming</a> in 1987,
when the name hierarchy of USENET topic groups was reorganized. The
other was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">&#34;September that never
ended&#34;</a> in 1993, when the AOL commercial timesharing services gave its
users access to USENET.  The resulting vast flood of newbies proved
difficult to acculturate.</p>
<p>UUCP explains a quirk you may run across in old mailing-list archives:
the bang-path address.  UUCP links were point-to-point and you had to
actually specify the route of your mail through the UUCP network; this
led to people publishing addresses of the form
&#34;…!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user&#34;, presuming that people who wanted to
reach them would know how to reach bigsite. As Internet access became
more common in the early 1990s, addresses of the form <a href="mailto:user@hostname">user@hostname</a>
displaced bang paths. During this transition period there were some
odd hybrid mail addresses that used a &#34;%&#34; to weld bang-path routing
to Internet routing.</p>
<p>UUCP was notoriously difficult to configure, enough so that people
who knew how often put that skill on their CVs in the justified
expectation that it could land them a job.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the microcomputer world, a different kind of
store-and-forward evolved - the BBS (Bulletin-Board System).  This was
software running on a computer (after 1991 usually an MS-DOS machine)
with one (or, rarely, more) attached modems that could accept incoming
phone calls.  Users (typically, just one user at a time!) would access
the BBS using a their own modem and a terminal program; the BBS
software would allow them to leave messages for each other, upload and
download files, and sometimes play games.</p>
<p>The first BBS, patterned after the community notice-board in a
supermarket, was fielded in Chicago in 1978. Over the next eighteen
years over a hundred thousand BBSes flashed in and out of existence,
typically run out of the sysop’s bedroom or garage with a
spare computer.</p>
<p>From 1984 the BBS culture evolved a primitive form of internetworking
called &#34;FidoNet&#34; that supported cross-site email and a forum system
broadly resembling USENET. There were also a few ports of UUCP to DOS
personal computers, but none gained any real traction. Thus the UUCP
and BBS cultures remained separate until both were ploughed under
by the Internet.</p>
<p>During a very brief period after 1990, just before mass-market
Internet, software with BBS-like capabilities but supporting multiple
simultaneous modem users (and often offering USENET access) got written
for low-cost Unix systems.  The end-stage BBSes, when they survived,
moved to the Web and dropped modem access.  The
<a href="https://cellar.org/faq.php?s=cf9b960cb5e732446d4d5ec5b9b4eb29&amp;faq=what_it_is#faq_cellar_history">history
of cellar.org</a> chronicles this period.</p>
<p>A handful of BBSes are still run by nostalgicists, and some artifacts
from the culture are still <a href="http://textfiles.com/">preserved</a>. But, like
the UUCP network, the BBS culture as a whole collapsed when
inexpensive Internet became widely available.</p>
<p>Almost the only cultural memory of BBSes left is around a family of
file-transfer protocols - XMODEM, YMODEM, and ZMODEM - developed
shortly before BBSes and primarily used on them. For hackers of that
day who did not cut their teeth on minicomputers with native TCP/IP,
these were a first introduction to concepts like packetization, error
detection, and retransmission. To this day (2018), hardware from at least one
commercial router vendor (Cisco) accepts software patches by XMODEM
upload through a serial port.</p>
<p>Also roughly contemporaneous with USENET and the BBS culture, and also
destroyed or absorbed by cheap Internet, were some commercial
timesharing services supporting dialup access by modem, of which the
best known were AOL (America Online) CompuServe, and GEnie; others
included The Source and Prodigy. These provided BBS-like
facilities. Every hacker knew of these, though few used them. They
have left no traces at all in today’s hacker culture.</p>
<p>One last tier of pre-Internets, operating from about 1981 to about
1991 with isolated survivals into the 2000s, was various academic
wide-area networks using leased-line telephone links: CSNET, BITNET,
EARN, VIDYANET, and others. These generally supported email and
file-transfer services that would be recognizable to Internet users,
though with different addressing schemes and some odd quirks (such as
not being 8-bit clean). They <em>have</em> left some traces today. Notably,
the term &#34;listserv&#34; for an electronic mailing list, still occasionally
used today, derives from an email reflector used on BITNET.</p>

<h2 id="_ftp_gopher_and_the_forgotten_pre_web">FTP, Gopher, and the forgotten pre-Web</h2>
<div>
<p>The World Wide Web went from nowhere to ubiquity during a few short
years in the early 1990s. Before that, from 1971 onwards, file
transfer between Internet sites was normally done with a tool named
ftp, for the File Transfer Protocol it used.  Every hacker once knew
how to use this tool.</p>
<p>Eventually ftp was mostly subsumed by web browsers speaking the FTP protocol
themselves. This is why you may occasionally still see URLs with an
&#34;ftp:&#34; service prefix; this informs the browser that it should expect
to speak to an FTP server rather than an HTTP/HTTPS server.</p>
<p>There was another.  The same year (1991) that Tim Berners-Lee was
inventing the World Wide Web, a group of hackers at the University of
Minnesota devised &#34;Gopher&#34;, a hypertext protocol that was menu-centric
rather than link-centric.  For a few years Gopher competed vigorously
with the early Web, and many hackers used both.  Adoption was stalled
when the University decided to charge a license fee for its
implementation in early 1993.  Then, early Web browsers added the
ability to speak Gopher protocol and display Gopher documents. By 2000
Gopher was effectively dead, although a few Gopher servers are still
operated in a spirit of nostalgia and irony.</p>

<h2 id="_terminal_confusion">Terminal confusion</h2>
<div>
<p>The software terminal emulators on modern Unix systems are the
near-end - and probably final - manifestations of a long and rather
confused history.  It began with early displays sometimes called
&#34;glass TTYs&#34; because they emulated teletypes - but less expensively,
because they didn’t require consumables like paper.  The phrase &#34;dumb
terminal&#34; is equivalent. The first of these was shipped in 1969.
The best-remembered of them is probably still the ADM-3 from 1975.</p>
<p>The very earliest VDTs, like the ASR-33 before them, could form only
upper-case letters. An interesting hangover from these devices was
that, even though most VDTs made after 1975 could form lower-case
letters, Unix (and Linux as late as 2018) responded to a login
beginning with an upper-case letter by switching to a mode which
upcased all input.  If you create an account with this sort of
login name and a mixed-case password, hilarity ensues.  If the
password is upper-case the hilarity is less desperate but still
confusing for the user.</p>
<p>The classic &#34;smart terminal&#34; VDT designs that have left a mark on
later computing appeared during a relatively short period beginning in
1975.  Devices like the Lear-Siegler ADM-3A (1976) and the DEC VT-100
(1978) inherited the 80-character line width of punched cards (longer
than the 72-character line length of teletypes) and supported as many
lines as could fit on an approximately 4:3 screen (and in 2K bytes of
display memory); they are the reason your software terminal emulator
has a 24x80 or 25x80 default size.</p>
<p>These terminals were called &#34;smart&#34; because they could interpret
control codes to do things like addressing the cursor to any point on
the screen in order to produce truly 2-dimensional displays
. The ability to do bold, underline or
reverse-video highlighting also rapidly became common.  Colored text
and backgrounds, however, only became available a few years before
VDTs were obsolesced; before that displays were monochromatic.  Some
had crude, low-resolution dot graphics; a few types supported
black-and-white vector graphics.</p>
<p>Early VDTs used a crazy variety of control codes.  One of the
principal relics of this era is the Unix terminfo database, which
tracked these codes so terminal-using applications could do abstracted
operations like &#34;move the cursor&#34; without being restricted to working
with just one terminal type.  The curses(3) library still used with
software terminal emulators was originally intended to make this sort
of thing easier.</p>
<p>After 1979 there was an ANSI standard for terminal control codes,
based on the DEC VT-100 (being supported in the IBM PC’s original
screen driver gave it a boost) . By the early 1990s ANSI conformance was
close to universal in VDTs, which is why that’s what your software
terminal emulator does.</p>
<p>This whole technology category was rapidly wiped out in
general-purpose computing, like dinosaurs after the Alvarez strike,
when bit-mapped color displays on personal computers that could match
the dot pitch of a monochrome VDT became relatively inexpensive,
around 1992. The legacy VDT hardware lingered longest in dedicated
point-of-sale systems, remaining not uncommon until as late as 2010 or
so.</p>
<p>It’s not true, as is sometimes suggested, that heritage from the VDT
era explains the Unix command line - that actually predated VDTs,
going back to the last generation of printing terminals in the late
1960s and early 1970s.  Every hacker once knew that this is why we
often speak of &#34;printing&#34; output when we mean sending it to
standard output that is normally connected to a terminal emulator.</p>
<p>What the VDT era <strong>does</strong> explain is some of our heritage games (see
next section) and a few surviving utility programs like vi(1), top(1)
and mutt(1).  These are what advanced visual interfaces looked like in
the VDT era, before bitmapped displays and GUIs.  This is why program
interfaces that are two-dimensional but use characters only are now
called TUI (&#34;terminal user interface&#34;), but the term is an
anachronism; it was coined after &#34;GUI&#34; became common.</p>
<p>It also explains &#34;screensavers&#34;. Every hacker once knew that these are
so called because cathode-ray tubes were subject to a phenomenon
called &#34;phosphor burn-in&#34; that could permanently damage the screen’s
ability to display information. Software to randomly vary the image(s)
on your display was originally written to prevent burn-in.
Flatscreens don’t have this problem; the secondary purpose of doing
something visually interesting with that blank space took over.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_early_awful_days_of_bitmapped_displays">The early, awful days of bitmapped displays</h2>
<div>
<p>Terminals - which could usually only display a fixed alphabet of
formed characters - were eventually replaced by the &#34;bitmapped&#34; style
of display we’re used to today, with individual screen pixels
manipulable.  Every hacker once knew that though there were earlier
precedents done as research, the first production system with a
bitmapped display was the Alto, built at the Xerox Palo Alto Research
Center in 1973. (The laser printer and Ethernet were also invented
there.)</p>
<p>It was <strong>not</strong> generally known that the Alto had a display only 608 pixels
wide and 808 high - folk memory confused it with later displays in the
1024x1024 range. Its 1981 successor the Dandelion achieved 1024×809;
an attempt to commercialize it as the &#34;Xerox Star&#34; failed. But in 1982
the newly-born Sun Microsystems shipped the Sun-1 with 1024×800
pixels; descendants of this machine (and very similar designs by other
vendors) became enormously successful - until they were wiped out by
descendants of the IBM PC in the late 1990s. Before that, most hackers
dreamed of owning a Sun-class workstation, and the bitmapped display
was a significant part of that allure.</p>
<p>Alas, these machines were too expensive for individuals. But from 1975
onwards primitive bitmapped-display began to appear on personal
color computers such as the Apple II, often through consumer-grade television
sets.  These had one feature the workstation displays of the time lacked -
color - but their pixel resolutions were laughable by comparison. The
Apple II in &#34;Hi-res&#34; mode could only manage 280×192, an area you could
easily cover with the palm of your hand on the displays of 2017.</p>
<p>People who remember these early consumer-grade color displays show a
tendency to both think they arrived sooner than they did and filter
their memories through a nostalgic haze.  In reality they remained
astoundingly bad compared to even a Sun-1 for a long time after the
Apple II; you couldn’t get even near the crispness of an 80×24 display
of text on a VDT with them.  Using a consumer-grade TV also meant
coping with eyestrain-inducing artifacts around the limited amount of
text it could display, due to NTSC chroma-luminance crossover.</p>
<p>Because hackers <strong>needed</strong> good text display for programming - and
because many knew what workstation graphics in the 1024×1024 range
looked like - many of us dismissed these displays (and the computers
they were attached to) as near-useless toys.  We sought workstation
graphics when we could get it and used VDTs when we couldn’t.</p>
<p>In 1984, the original Macintosh was the first consumer-grade machine
with a dedicated bit-mapped display that come within even distant hail
of workstation-class graphics - 512×342 black and white. It was shortly
followed by the IBM EGA adapter and its numerous cheap clones with
640x350 at a whopping 16 colors, accompanied by flicker and other
artifacts. In the following years, 256 colors gradually crept in,
starting with a resolution of - wait for it - 320x200.</p>
<p>For another five years or so consumer hardware was still split between
low-resolution b&amp;w displays and <em>abysmally</em> low-resolution,
hard-to-use color displays. If we had to use a consumer-grade computer
at all, most of us tended to prefer the many b&amp;w displays that were
relatively inexpensive, surprisingly nice on the eyes and better for
our life’s work - code.</p>
<p>There was, however, a cohort of hackers (especially among the younger
and newer ones of the mid-1980s) who worked hard to get as much
performance as they could from the pathetic color displays and TVs, as
well as from the earliest attempts at computer sound hardware. The
resulting chunky graphics with pixelated &#34;sprites&#34; moving across the
screen, accompanied by a chirpy/buzzy style of music and sound effects
is still used in some 21st-century games for pure nostalgic value.
If you hear a reference to &#34;8-bit&#34; graphics or sound, that’s what
it means in these latter days.</p>
<p>Monitors capable of 1024×1024 <em>color</em> display did not reach even the
high end of the consumer market until about 1990 and did not become
generally available until about 1992. Not by coincidence, this was
when PC manufacturers began to put serious pressure on workstation
vendors. But for some years after that the quality of these displays
remained relatively poor, with coarse dot pitches and fringing effects
due to the expense and difficulty of manufacturing decent color masks
for cathode-ray tubes.  These problems weren’t fully solved until CRTs
were on the verge of being obsolesced by flatscreens.</p>
<p>Once we were able to take color displays at 1024x1024 and up for
granted, a lot of this history faded from memory. Even people who
lived through it have a tendency to forget what conditions were like
before flatscreens, and are often surprised to be reminded how low the
pixel resolutions were on older hardware.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="_games_before_guis">Games before GUIs</h2>
<div>
<p>Before bit-mapped color displays became common and made
graphics-intensive games the norm, there was a vigorous tradition of
games that required only textual interfaces or the character-cell
graphics on a VDT.</p>
<p>These VDT games often found their way to early microcomputers as well.
In part this was because some of those early micros themselves had
weak or nonexistent graphical capabilities, and in part because
textual games were relatively easy to port and featured as type-in
projects in magazines and books.</p>
<p>The oldest group of games that were once common knowledge are the
<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/super-star-trek/">Trek</a> family, a clade of
games going back to 1971 in which the player flew the starship
Enterprise through the Federation fighting Klingons and Romulans and
other enemies. Every hacker over a certain age remembers spending
hours playing these.</p>
<p>The history of the Trek clade is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(text_game)">too complex to
summarize here</a>.  The thing to notice about them is that the extremely
crude interface (designed not even for VDTs but for teletypes!) hid
what was actually a relatively sophisticated wargame in which
initiative, tactical surprise, and logistics all played significant
roles.</p>
<p>Every hacker once knew what the phrase &#34;You are in a maze of twisty
little passages, all alike&#34; meant, and often used variants about
confusing situations in real life (For example, &#34;You are in a maze of
twisty little technical standards, all different&#34;).  It was from the
<em>very first</em> dungeon-crawling adventure game, <em>Colossal Cave
Adventure</em> (1977). People who knew this game from its beginnings often
thought of it as ADVENT, after its 6-character filename on the PDP-10
where it first ran .</p>
<p>When the original author of ADVENT wasn’t inventing an entire genre of
computer games, he was
<a href="http://www.filfre.net/2011/05/will-crowthers-adventure-part-1/">writing
the low-level firmware for some of the earliest ARPANET routers</a>. This
was not generally known at the time, but illustrates how intimate the
connection between these early games and the cutting edge of serious
programming was. &#34;Game designer&#34; was not yet a separate thing, then.</p>
<p>You might occasionally encounter &#34;xyzzy&#34; as a nonce variable name.
Every hacker used to know that xyzzy was a magic word in ADVENT.</p>
<p>ADVENT had a direct successor that was even more popular - Zork, first
released in 1979 by hackers at MIT on a PDP-10 (initially under the name
&#34;Dungeon&#34;) and later successfully commercialized. This game is why
every hacker once knew that a zorkmid was the currency of the Great
Underground Empire, and that if you wander around in dark places
without your lantern lit you might be eaten by a grue.</p>
<p>There was another family of games that took a different, more visual
approach to dungeon-crawling. They are generally called &#34;roguelikes&#34;,
after the earliest widely-distributed games in this group, <em>Rogue</em>
from 1980.  They featured top-down, maplike views of dungeon levels
through which the player would wander battling monsters and seeking
treasure.</p>
<p>The most widely played games in this group were Hack (1982) and
Nethack (1987).  Nethack is notable for having been one of the
earliest programs in which the development group was consciously
organized as a distributed collaboration over the Internet;
at the time, this was a sufficiently novel idea to be advertised
in the project’s name.</p>
<p>Rogue’s descendants were the most popular and successful TUI games
ever.  Though they gradually passed out of universal common knowledge
after the mid-1990s, they retain devoted minority followings even
today.  Their fans accurately point out that the primitive state of
interface design encouraged concentration on plot and story values,
leading to a surprisingly rich imaginative experience.</p>

<h2 id="_ascii">ASCII</h2>
<div>
<p>ASCII, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, evolved
in the early 1960s out of a family of character codes used on
teletypes.</p>
<p>ASCII, unlike a lot of other early character encodings, is likely to
live forever - because by design the low 127 code points of Unicode
<strong>are</strong> ASCII.  If you know what UTF-8 is (and you should) every ASCII
file is correct UTF-8 as well.</p>

<p>Using the second table, it’s easier to understand a couple of things:</p>
<div><ul>
<li>
<p>
The Control modifier on your keyboard basically clears the top three
  bits of whatever character you type, leaving the bottom five and
  mapping it to the 0..31 range.  So, for example, Ctrl-SPACE, Ctrl-@,
  and Ctrl-` all mean the same thing: NUL.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Very old keyboards used to do Shift just by toggling the 32 or 16
  bit, depending on the key; this is why the relationship between
  small and capital letters in ASCII is so regular, and the
  relationship between numbers and symbols, and some pairs of symbols,
  is sort of regular if you squint at it. The ASR-33, which was an
  all-uppercase terminal, even let you generate some punctuation characters
  it didn’t have keys for by shifting the 16 bit; thus, for example,
  Shift-K (0x4B) became a [ (0x5B)
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>It used to be common knowledge that the original 1963 ASCII had been
slightly different. It lacked tilde and vertical bar; 5E was an
up-arrow rather than a caret, and 5F was a left arrow rather than
underscore. Some early adopters (notably DEC) held to the 1963 version.</p>
<p>If you learned your chops after 1990 or so, the mysterious part of
this is likely the control characters, code points 0-31.  You probably
know that C uses NUL as a string terminator.  Others, notably LF =
Line Feed and HT = Horizontal Tab, show up in plain text.  But what
about the rest?</p>
<p>Many of these are remnants from teletype protocols that have either
been dead for a very long time or, if still live, are completely
unknown in computing circles. A few had conventional meanings that
were half-forgotten even before Internet times.  A <strong>very</strong> few are
still used in binary data protocols today.</p>
<p>Here’s a tour of the meanings these had in older computing, or retain
today. If you feel an urge to send me more, remember that the emphasis
here is on what was <em>common knowledge</em> back in the day.  If I don’t
know it now, we probably didn’t generally know it then.</p>
<div><dl>
<dt>
NUL (Null) = Ctrl-@
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Survives as the string terminator in C.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
SOH (Start of Heading) = Ctrl-A
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Rarely used (as Ctrl-A) as a section divider in otherwise textual
   formats. Some versions of Unix mailbox format used it as a
   message divider. One very old version-control system (SCCS)
   did something similar.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
STX (Start of Text), ETX (End of Text) = Ctrl-B, Ctrl-C
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Very rarely used as packet or control-sequence delimiters.  You
   will probably never see this, and the only place I’ve ever seen
   it was on a non-Unix OS in the early 1980s.  ETX is Ctrl-C,
   which is a SIGINT interrupt character on Unix systems, but that has
   nothing to do with its ASCII meaning per se and probably derives from
   abbreviating the word &#34;Cancel&#34;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
EOT (End of Transmission) = Ctrl-D
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   As Ctrl-D, the way you type &#34;End of file&#34; to a Unix terminal.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
ENQ (Enquiry) = Ctrl-E
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   In the days of hardware serial terminals, there was a convention
   that if a computer sent ENQ to a terminal, it should answer back with
   terminal type identification. While this was not universal, it at
   least gave computers a fighting chance of autoconfiguring what
   capabilities it could assume the terminal to have.  Further back,
   on teletypes, the answerback had been a station ID rather than a
   device type; as late as the 1970s it was still generally remembered
   that ENQ’s earliest name in ASCII had been WRU (&#34;Who are you?&#34;).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
ACK (Acknowledge) = Ctrl-F
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   It used to be common for wire protocols written in ASCII to use
   ENQ/ACK as a handshake, sometimes with NAK as a failure indication
   (the XMODEM/YMODEM/ZMODEM protocol did this ).  Hackers used to use ACK in speech as
   &#34;I hear you&#34; and were a bit put out when this convention was
   disrupted in the 1980s by Bill The Cat’s &#34;Ack! Thppt!&#34;
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
BEL (Bell) = Ctrl-G
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Make the bell ring on the teletype - an attention signal.  This
   often worked on VDTs as well, but is no longer reliably the
   default on software terminal emulators.  Some map it to a
   visual indication like flashing the title bar.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
BS (Backspace) = Ctrl-H
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Still does what it says on the tin, though there has been some
   historical confusion over whether the backspace key on a keyboard
   should behave like BS (nondestructive cursor move) or DEL
   (backspace and delete).  Never used in textual data protocols.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
HT (Horizontal tab) = Ctrl-I
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Still does what it says on the tin. Sometimes used as a field
   separator in Unix textual file formats, but this is now
   old-fashioned and declining in usage.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
LF (Line Feed) = Ctrl-J
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   The Unix textual end-of-line.  Printing terminals interpreted it as
   &#34;scroll down one line&#34;; the Unix tty driver would normally wedge in
   a CR right before it on output (or in early versions, right after).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
VT (Vertical Tab) = Ctrl-K
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   In the days of printing terminals this often caused them to scroll
   down a configurable number of lines.  VDTs had any number of
   possible behaviors; at least some pre-ANSI ones interpreted VT as
   &#34;scroll <strong>up</strong> one line&#34;. The only reason anybody remembers this one
   at all is that it persisted in Unix definitions of what a
   whitespace character is, even though it’s now extinct in the wild.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
FF (Form Feed) = Ctrl-L
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Eject the current page from your printing
   terminal.  Many VDTs interpreted this as a &#34;clear screen&#34;
   instruction.  Software terminal emulators sometimes still do. Often
   interpreted as a &#34;screen refresh&#34; request in textual-input Unix
   programs that bind other control characters (shells, editors,
   more/less, etc)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
CR (Carriage Return) = Ctrl-M
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   It is now possible that the reader has never seen a typewriter, so
   this needs explanation: &#34;carriage return&#34; is the operation of
   moving your print head or cursor to the left margin. Windows, other
   non-Unix operating systems, and some Internet protocols (such as
   SMTP) tend to use CR-LF as a line terminator, rather than bare LF.
   The reason it was CR-LF rather than LF-CR goes back to Teletypes: a
   Teletype printed ten characters per second, but the print-head
   carriage took longer than a tenth of a second to return to the left
   side of the paper.  So if you ended a line with line-feed, then
   carriage-return, you would usually see the first character of the
   next line smeared across the middle of the paper, having been
   struck while the carriage was still zipping to the left.  Pre-Unix
   MacOS used a bare CR.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
SO (Shift Out), SI (Shift In) = Ctrl-N, Ctrl-O
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Escapes to and from an alternate character set. Unix software used
   to emit them to drive pre-ANSI VDTs that interpreted them that way,
   but native Unix usage is rare to nonexistent.  On teletypes with a
   two-color ink ribbon (the second color usually being red) SO was a
   command to shift to the alternate color, SI to shift back.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
DLE (Data Link Escape) = Ctrl-P
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Sometimes used as a packet-framing character in binary protocols.
   That is, a packet starts with a DLE, ends with a DLE, and if one
   of the interior data bytes matches DLE it is doubled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
DC[1234] (Device Control [1234]) = Ctrl-[QRST]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Four device control codes used by the once-ubiquitous ASR-33
   teletype to turn on and off its paper-tape reader and punch, which
   were used to read and write machine-readable data.  On serial
   terminals, there was a common software flow-control protocol - used
   over ASCII but separate from it - in which XOFF (DC3) was used as a
   request to pause transmission and XON (DC1) was used as a request
   to resume transmission.  As Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q these were
   implemented in the Unix terminal driver and long outlived their
   origin in the Model 33 Teletype. And not just Unix; this was
   implemented in CP/M and DOS, too.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
NAK (Negative Acknowledge) = Ctrl-U
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   See the discussion of ACK above.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
SYN (Synchronous Idle) = Ctrl-V
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Never to my knowledge used specially after teletypes, except in
   synchronous serial protocols never used on micros or minis.  Be careful
   not to confuse this with the SYN (synchronization) packet used
   in TCP/IP’s SYN SYN-ACK initialization sequence.  In an unrelated
   usage, many Unix tty drivers use this (as Ctrl-V) for the
   literal-next character that lets you quote following control
   characters such as Ctrl-C.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
ETB (End of Transmission Block) = Ctrl-W
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Nowadays this is usually &#34;kill window&#34; on a web browser, but it
   used to mean &#34;delete previous word&#34; in some contexts and sometimes
   still does.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
CAN (Cancel), EM (End of Medium) = Ctrl-X, Ctrl-Y
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Never to my knowledge used specially after teletypes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
SUB (Substitute) = Ctrl-Z
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   DOS and Windows use Ctrl-Z (SUB) as an end-of-file character; this
   is unrelated to its ASCII meaning. It was common knowledge then
   that this use of ^Z had been inherited from a now largely forgotten
   earlier OS called CP/M (1974), and into CP/M from earlier DEC
   minicomputer OSes such as RSX-11 (1972).  Unix uses Ctrl-Z as the
   &#34;suspend process&#34; command keystroke.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
ESC (Escape)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Still commonly used as a control-sequence introducer.  This usage
   is especially associated with the control sequences recognized
   by VT100 and ANSI-standard VDTs, and today by essentially all
   software terminal emulators
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
[FGRU]S ({Field|Group|Record|Unit} Separator)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   There are some uses of these in ATM and bank protocols (these
   have never been common knowledge, but I’m adding this note to forestall
   yet more repetitions from area specialists who will apparently
   otherwise keep telling me about it until the end of time). FS, as
   Ctrl-\, sends SIGQUIT under some Unixes, but this has nothing
   to do with ASCII. Ctrl-] (GS) is the exit character from telnet,
   but this also has nothing to do with its ASCII meaning.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
DEL (Delete)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Usually an input character meaning &#34;backspace and delete&#34;.
   Under older Unix variants, sometimes a SIGINT interrupt character.
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<p>The &#34;Break&#34; key on a teletype mimicked the current-loop line
   condition of a broken wire.  A quiet teletype machine would start
   cycling but doing nothing when the line was disconnected, so it was
   possible to know that this had occurred.  (It was effectively
   receiving a series of NULL characters.)</p>
<p>Not all of these were so well known that any hacker could instantly
map from mnemonic to binary, or vice-versa.  The well-known set was
roughly NUL, BEL, BS, HT, LF, FF, CR, ESC, and DEL.</p>
<p>There are a few other bits of ASCII lore worth keeping in mind…</p>
<div><ul>
<li>
<p>
A Meta or Alt key on a VDT added 128 to the ASCII keycode for
  whatever it’s modifying (probably - on a few machines with peculiar
  word lengths they did different things).  Software terminal
  emulators have more variable behavior; many of them now simply
  insert an ESC before the modified key, which Emacs treats as
  equivalent to adding 128.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
An item of once-common knowledge that was half-forgotten fairly
  early (like, soon after VDTs replaced teletypes) is that the
  binary value of DEL (0x7F, 0b01111111) descends from its use on
  paper tape. Seven punches could overwrite any character in ASCII,
  and tape readers skipped DEL (and NUL - no punches).  This is why
  DEL was anciently called the &#34;Rubout&#34; character and is an island at
  the other end of the ASCII table from the other control characters.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
VDT keyboards often had a &#34;Break&#34; key inherited from the ASR-33
  (there’s a vestigial remnant of this even on the IBM PC keyboard).
  On the AS-33 this had mimicked the current-loop line condition of a
  broken wire, which was detectable. On a VDT this didn’t send a
  well-formed ASCII character; rather, it caused an out-of-band
  condition that would be seen as a NUL with a framing error at the
  other end. This was used as an attention or interrupt signal
  .
</p>
</li>

<h2 id="_the_slow_birth_of_distributed_collaboration">The slow birth of distributed collaboration</h2>
<div>
<p>Nowadays we take for granted a public infrastructure of distributed
version control and a lot of practices for distributed teamwork that
go with it - including development teams that never physically have to
meet. But these tools, and awareness of how to use them, were a long
time developing.  They replace whole layers of earlier practices that
were once general but are now half- or entirely forgotten.</p>
<p>The earliest practice I can identify that was directly ancestral was
the DECUS tapes.  DECUS was the Digital Equipment Corporation Users&#39;
Group, chartered in 1961. One of its principal activities was
circulating magnetic tapes of public-domain software shared by DEC
users. The early history of these tapes is not well-documented, but
the habit was well in place by 1976.</p>
<p>One trace of the DECUS tapes seems to be the README convention. While
it entered the Unix world through USENET in the early 1980s, it seems
to have spread there from DECUS tapes.  The DECUS tapes begat the
USENET source-code groups, which were the incubator of the practices
that later became &#34;open source&#34;. Unix hackers used to watch for
interesting new stuff on comp.sources.unix as automatically as they
drank their morning coffee.</p>
<p>The DECUS tapes and the USENET sources groups were more of a
publishing channel than a collaboration medium, though. Three pieces
were missing to fully support that: version control, patching, and
forges.</p>
<p>Version control was born in 1972, though SCCS (Source Code Control
System) didn’t escape Bell Labs until 1977. The proprietary licensing
of SCCS slowed its uptake; one response was the freely reusable RCS
(Revision Control System) in 1982.</p>
<p>The first real step towards across-network collaboration was the
patch(1) utility in 1984.  The concept seems so obvious now that
even hackers who predate patch(1) have trouble remembering what it
was like when we only knew how to pass around source-code changes
as entire altered files. But that’s how it was.</p>
<p>Even with SCCS/RCS/patch the friction costs of distributed development
over the Internet were still so high that some years passed before
anyone thought to try it seriously.  I have looked for, but not found,
definite examples earlier than nethack. This was a roguelike game
launched in 1987.  Nethack developers passed around whole files - and
later patches - by email, sometimes using SCCS or RCS to manage local
copies. .</p>
<p>Distributed development could not really get going until the third
major step in version control.  That was CVS (Concurrent Version
System) in 1990, the oldest VCS still in wide use at time of writing
in 2017.  Though obsolete and now half-forgotten, CVS was the first
version-control system to become so ubiquitous that every hacker once
knew it. CVS, however, had significant design flaws ; it fell out of use rapidly when better alternatives
became available.</p>
<p>Between around 1989 and the breakout of mass-market Internet in
1993-1994, fast Internet became available enough to hackers that
distributed development in the modern style began to become thinkable.
The next major steps were not technical changes but cultural ones.</p>
<p>In 1991 Linus Torvalds announced Linux as a distributed collaborative
effort.  It is now easy to forget that early Linux development used
the same patch-by-email method as nethack - there were no public Linux
repositories yet.  The idea that there <strong>ought</strong> to be public
repositories as a normal practice for major projects (in addition to
shipping source tarballs) wouldn’t really take hold until after I
published &#34;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&#34; in 1997. While CatB was
influential in promoting distributed development via shared public
repositories, the technical weaknesses of CVS were in hindsight
probably an equally important reason this practice did not become
established sooner and faster.</p>
<p>The first dedicated software forge was not spun up until 1999.  That
was SourceForge, still extant today (2018).  At first it supported
only CVS, but it sped up the adoption of the (greatly superior)
Subversion, launched in 2000 by a group of former CVS developers.</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2005 Subversion became ubiquitous common knowledge.
But in 2005 Linus Torvalds invented git, which would fairly rapidly
obsolesce all previous version-control systems and is a thing every
hacker <strong>now</strong> knows .</p>

<h2 id="_key_dates">Key dates</h2>

<p>These are dates that every hacker knew were important at the time, or
shortly afterwards.  I’ve tried to concentrate on milestones for which

  Linux running on PCs. Launch of SourceForge, the first public
  shared-repository site.

  Dot-com bubble pops. PC hardware with workstation-class capabilities
  becomes fully commoditized; pace of visible innovation in mass-market computers
  slows noticeably.

<p>
  Major manufacturers cease production of cathode-ray tubes in favor
  of flat-panel displays. Flat-panels have been ubiquitous on new
  hardware since about 2003. There is a brief window until about 2007
  during which high-end CRTs no longer in production still exceed the
  resolution of flat-panel displays and are still sought after.
  Also in 2005, AOL drops USENET support and Endless September ends.
  Git first ships.

  64-bit transition in mass market PCs; the 32-bit era
  ends. Single-processor speeds plateau at 4±0.25GHz.
  iPhone and Android (both with Unix-based OSes) first ship.

<div>
<p>A lot of people reading this have been seized by the urge to send me some
bit of lore or trivia for inclusion.  Thank you, but bear in mind that
the most important choice is what to leave out.  Here are some
guidelines:</p>
<div><ul>
<li>
<p>
I’m trying to describe <em>common knowledge at the time.</em>  That means
  not every bit of fascinating but obscure trivia belongs here.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Anything from a tech generation before early minis - in particular
  the era of mainframes, punched cards, and paper tape - is out of scope.
  I gotta draw the line somewhere, and it’s there.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Stories about isolated survivals of old tech today are not interesting
  if the tech wasn’t once common knowledge.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Please do not send me timeline entries for dates which you think are
  important unless you think the date has generally been
  forgotten, or is in serious danger of same.
</p>
