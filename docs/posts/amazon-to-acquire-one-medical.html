<p>    <location value="LU/us.wa.seatle" idsrc="xmltag.org">SEATTLE</location> &amp; <location value="LU/us.ca.sanfrn" idsrc="xmltag.org">SAN FRANCISCO</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 21, 2022--

“We think health care is high on the list of experiences that need reinvention. Booking an appointment, waiting weeks or even months to be seen, taking time off work, driving to a clinic, finding a parking spot, waiting in the waiting room then the exam room for what is too often a rushed few minutes with a doctor, then making another trip to a pharmacy – we see lots of opportunity to both improve the quality of the experience <i>and </i>give people back valuable time in their days,” said <person>Neil Lindsay</person>, SVP of <org>Amazon Health Services</org>. “We love inventing to make what should be easy easier and we want to be one of the companies that helps dramatically improve the healthcare experience over the next several years. Together with One Medical’s human-centered and technology-powered approach to health care, we believe we can and will help more people get better care, when and how they need it. We look forward to delivering on that long-term mission.”
</p>
<p>
“The opportunity to transform health care and improve outcomes by combining One Medical’s human-centered and technology-powered model and exceptional team with Amazon’s customer obsession, history of invention, and willingness to invest in the long-term is so exciting,” said <person>Amir Dan Rubin</person>, One Medical CEO. “There is an immense opportunity to make the health care experience more accessible, affordable, and even enjoyable for patients, providers, and payers. We look forward to innovating and expanding access to quality healthcare services, together.”
