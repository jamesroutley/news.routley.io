<p><strong><a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/i-was-forced-to-use-ai-until-the">Copywriters reveal how AI has decimated their industry</a></strong>. Brian Merchant has been collecting personal stories for his series <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/s/ai-killed-my-job">AI Killed My Job</a> - previously covering <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-ai-is-killing-jobs-in-the-tech-f39">tech workers</a>, <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-killed-my-job-translators">translators</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/artists-are-losing-work-wages-and">artists</a> - and this latest piece includes anecdotes from 12 professional copywriters all of whom have had their careers devastated by the rise of AI-generated copywriting tools.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a tough read. Freelance copywriting does not look like a great place to be right now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI is really dehumanizing, and I am still working through issues of self-worth as a result of this experience. When you go from knowing you are valuable and valued, with all the hope in the world of a full career and the ability to provide other people with jobs... To being relegated to someone who edits AI drafts of copy at a steep discount because “most of the work is already done” ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The big question for me is if a new AI-infested economy creates new jobs that are a great fit for people affected by this. I would hope that clear written communication skills are made even more valuable, but the people interviewed here don&#39;t appear to be finding that to be the case.</p>
