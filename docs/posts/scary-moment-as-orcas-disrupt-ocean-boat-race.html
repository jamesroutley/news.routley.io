No one was injured, but Team JAJO skipper Jelmer van Beek said in a video posted on The Ocean Race website that it was &#34;a scary moment.&#34;</p><p><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E1rqcI2jULY" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></iframe></span></p><p>&#34;Twenty minutes ago, we got hit by some orcas,&#34; he said in the video. &#34;Three orcas came straight at us and started hitting the rudders. Impressive to see the orcas, beautiful animals, but also a dangerous moment for us as a team.&#34;</p><p>Team JAJO was approaching the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea on a leg from the Netherlands to Italy when at least three orcas approached the VO65 class sloop. Video taken by the crew showed one of the killer whales appeared to be nuzzling the rudder; another video showed one of them running its nose into the hull.</p><p>Scientists have noted increasing reports of orcas bumping or damaging boats off the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula in the past four years. The mammals average from 5-6 1/2 metres) and weigh more than 3,600 kilograms.</p><p>The behaviour defies easy explanation. A team of marine life researchers who study killer whales off Spain and Portugal has identified 15 individual orcas involved in the encounters — 13 of them young, supporting the hypothesis that they are playing. The fact that two are adults could support the competing and more sensational theory that they are responding to some traumatic event with a boat.</p><p>&#34;We knew that there was a possibility of an orca attack this leg,&#34; on-board reporter Brend Schuil said. &#34;So we had already spoken about what to do if the situation would occur.&#34;</p><p>Schuil said there was a call for all hands on deck and the sails were dropped to slow the boat from a racing speed of 12 knots. The crew made noises to to scare the orcas off.</p><p><em><strong>WATCH | Aggressive orcas damage boat off southern Spain:</strong></em></p><p><span><div><div title="Aggressive killer whales damage boat off coast of southern Spain" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div title="Aggressive killer whales damage boat off coast of southern Spain"><div><p><img srcset="

The crew called for help from Spanish authorities, who sent a rapid-response boat and a helicopter with a bilge pump to help them bail water. This is one of dozens of orca attacks that have been recorded so far this year off the coasts of Spain and Portugal.</span></span></p><p>&#34;They seemed more aggressive/playful when we were sailing at speed. Once we slowed down they also started to be less aggressive in their attacks,&#34; he said. &#34;Everyone is OK on board and the animals are also OK.&#34;</p><p>The Ocean Race involves two classes of sailboats at sea for weeks at a time, with the IMOCA 60 boats competing in a six-month, 32,000-nautical mile (37,000-mile, 59,000-km) circumnavigation of the globe. The race is on its final leg, from The Hague to Genoa, where it is expected to arrive later this week.</p><p>Boats have already contended with a giant seaweed flotilla, catastrophic equipment failure, and a collision that knocked the leader out of the decisive seventh leg. One of the boats in the around-the-world portion of the race triggered its hazard alarm after hitting what they suspected was a whale off the coast of Newfoundland; two crew members were injured in the collision.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
