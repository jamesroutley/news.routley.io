      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I&#39;m pretty discouraged, I&#39;m 37 and I&#39;ve tried numerous attempts over the last 20 years to start a software business as a solo founder and none have worked. I&#39;ve been working part-time to cover the bills while I work on creating the software I hoped to turn into business. My wife and I plan to start a family in the next two years, and I need to start getting serious here for my family&#39;s future. The industry is really hot right now, and I can make great money if I just get a full-time job.<p>I&#39;m building a programmable PostgreSQL proxy in Rust. The idea is to make it easy to consume the replication stream so it can do query caching with automatic invalidation, and so that people can build custom partitioning, caching, or real-time features on top of PostgreSQL. The proxy part is implemented, but there&#39;s still a lot of work to add the replication and caching features, and to test and polish everything to production standards - databases are serious business. The project is on github here: https://github.com/riverdb/riverdb</p><p>I don&#39;t even know if this is something people would want or pay for if I completed it. And then there&#39;s the task of marketing/selling it, which is way outside of my skillset.
Should I just give up (grow up?) and get a job? Is it worth pressing on here? I&#39;m not consuming my savings, but neither am I making financial progress, and I&#39;m not getting any younger.</p></td></tr>
