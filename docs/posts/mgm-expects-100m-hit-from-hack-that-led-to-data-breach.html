It expects to also incur less than $10 million as a related one-time cost in the quarter ended on Sept. 30.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">After the attack last month, customers posted social media images showing slot machines with error messages and queues at hotels in Las Vegas.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">A hacking group named AlphV claimed it was involved in the breach.

Analysts who have tracked Scattered Spider say more and more organizations have been falling for the group&#39;s skilled social engineering schemes.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">MGM said the hackers did not obtain any customer bank account numbers or payment card information, and that no data from its luxury resort hotel The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas was breached.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">&#34;The full scope of the costs and related impacts of this issue has not been determined,&#34; MGM said in a regulatory filing.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">The company expects the breach will have a negative impact of about $100 million to its adjusted property core profit for its Las Vegas Strip division, and expects total occupancy of 93% this October versus 94% in the same month a year ago.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">&#34;Virtually all of the Company&#39;s guest-facing systems have been restored,&#34; it said, adding that it expects no impact on its full-year results from the breach.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">MGM said it is &#34;well-positioned&#34; to have a strong fourth quarter with record results in November, driven mainly by a Formula One racing event slated to take place in Las Vegas.</p><p data-testid="Body">Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in San Francisco and Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar and Tom Hogue</p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
