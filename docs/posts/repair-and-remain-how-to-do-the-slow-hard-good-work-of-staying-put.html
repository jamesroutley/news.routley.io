    <h1>Repair and Remain: How to do the slow, hard, good work of staying put</h1>

				<div><p>I have come to think that renovation work is not inherently a sign of fashion-driven, bourgeois, consumerist excess; that beauty is not superfluous; and that a good renovation is a good investment. Taking care of your house is a wise and pragmatic thing to do. The integrity of a house means that all the parts and systems work as a whole, from ridge cap to footing and everything in between. Roof trusses, studs, joists, shiplap, plumbing supply and waste, eaves, windows, flooring, faucets, switches: your house will function as a house when it is well built and well maintained. Integrity of form, function, usability, and beauty. If it’s poorly made, or when it starts to fall apart, the integrity of the whole thing suffers. Give it enough time and a leak in the roof or a leak from a drain will ruin the whole thing.</p>
<p>If you ignore the little things long enough, something as small as a nail clipper can make for two days of demolition and a trailer filled with an old sink, outdated vanity, faded linoleum, some lath and plaster, old plumbing, a thirsty old toilet, and so on. I can haul those few thousand pounds of junk to the landfill and rebuild your bathroom. But in the end, when it’s all put back together again, what you have will still be the spot to do the same basic grooming and human-waste disposal. Pay attention and mind the details and you save yourself a lot of hassle and money. That slow corrosion that comes if you ignore the small, nagging troubles of your life has the potential to wreck a family the way a nail clipper can wreck a bathroom. And somebody’s going to pay for it, even if it isn’t you. Mostly it will be the kids, plus the ongoing emotional and spiritual costs divvied up among the friends, family, and community who witnessed your vows, who backed you as you struggled along, who loved you then and still love you now.</p>
<p>Because however it may sometimes seem that circumstance, fortune, and your exasperating spouse are conspiring to sabotage your happiness and peace of mind, the one certain, irrefutable common factor in all your circumstances is you. You are the bearer and carrier of grief, disappointment, frustration, and heartache, just as you are also the source of much of the same. So it goes. I’ve said it more than once to some guy across the table who tells me he’s planning to leave his marriage: You should stay. Sit in the awful, agonizing sorrow of it all, and figure some things out. Your life is very hard. I know you’ve thought it through more than I can imagine; I know you’ve calculated the cost-benefit, weighed your options; and all that is fine and good. There is no way of knowing how this will play out in your very real life. Nobody can predict the future. Something has to give, yes. But it doesn’t need to be this. <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/should-couples-in-unhappy-marriages-stay-together" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I think you should stay</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a tough sell. I understand, because my undisciplined imagination, formed like everyone else’s by countless half-minute ads and building-sized billboards, frolics among fantastic, glamorous possibilities of something other than what I’ve already got. It’s a cornucopia of options, with countless cathedrals and priests promising salvation at the marketplace, be it a new app, new phone, new car, new house, new job, new city, or new spouse. The promise is always the same: <em>this </em>thing will make you happy. Never mind trying to fix what you’ve got. Just get a new one and start over.</p>
<p>Repair and remain sounds simple because it is. But simple is not the same as easy. “For better, for worse,” we say, and everyone likes to stay when it’s the better. But staying through the worse—that’s the whole point of the vow, for Christ’s sake.</p></div>
