    <h1>D-Wave Launches in AWS Marketplace</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p dir="ltr">D-Wave provider of quantum computing systems, software and services has announced its launch in AWS Marketplace. </p>
<p dir="ltr">AWS Marketplace customers can purchase a variety of quantum computing offerings from D-Wave, including access to the Leap quantum cloud service. D-Wave is the first and only pure-play quantum computing company with offerings available in AWS Marketplace.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mark Snedeker, senior vice president of growth at D-Wave comments: “The era of commercial quantum computing is here. Forward-looking organisations are increasingly turning to quantum computing to find solutions for today’s complex and computationally intensive business problems, ultimately reducing costs and increasing revenue. By launching in AWS Marketplace, we’re introducing our Leap quantum computing service to AWS customers, enabling them to quickly and easily start deriving business value from quantum computing, today.&#34;</p>
<p dir="ltr">D-Wave is listing in AWS Marketplace to enable organisations to test the use of quantum computing. <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dwavesys.com%2Fcompany%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-release%2Fquantum-rising-new-study-reveals-69-of-companies-surveyed-already-have-an-in-house-quantum-computing-program%2F&amp;esheet=52949681&amp;newsitemid=20221021005086&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Hyperion+Research&amp;index=1&amp;md5=fc77ccc7c8380b2c48fbda1bc2634d7c">Hyperion Research</a> recently found that nearly 70 per cent of companies surveyed have an in-house quantum computing program, citing increased revenue, cost savings, enhanced business processes, innovation, and competitive advantage as key business priorities potentially achievable with quantum computing. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Numerous real-world, commercial applications have been developed by companies including BBVA, Deloitte, GSK, Lockheed Martin, Menten AI, Save-On-Foods, and Volkswagen to run on D-Wave’s quantum systems and its hybrid solvers, representing use cases spanning logistics and manufacturing, transportation and mobility, portfolio optimisation, preventative health care, airline scheduling, and more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To facilitate the development and production of practical quantum computing applications, D-Wave is introducing four offerings in AWS Marketplace, including:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leap Quantum Cloud Service: The Leap quantum cloud service provides real-time access to D-Wave’s state-of-the-art quantum computers and a quantum-classical hybrid solver service that can handle problems with up to one million variables and 100,000 constraints. Leap will be available in AWS Marketplace soon, and Amazon Braket customers will be directed to the AWS Marketplace to access the D-Wave system.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fmarketplace%2Fpp%2Fprodview-bsrc3yuwgjbo4&amp;esheet=52949681&amp;newsitemid=20221021005086&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Quantum+Feature+Selection+for+Machine+Learning&amp;index=3&amp;md5=610a2595eeb23db8a2688009f86d26eb" target="_blank">Quantum Feature Selection for Machine Learning</a>: With increasing data sets comes increasing complexity, especially when it comes to feature selection, a fundamental building block of machine learning. This program focuses on utilising quantum hybrid approaches to optimise feature selection in model training and prediction.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fmarketplace%2Fpp%2Fprodview-nnjwetis2qnhw&amp;esheet=52949681&amp;newsitemid=20221021005086&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Quantum+Consulting+Services&amp;index=4&amp;md5=9b977d70ae5f035d6a02b449be5c1759" target="_blank">Quantum Consulting Services</a>: To help customers get started with quantum or implement a quantum solution, D-Wave’s Launch service combines technical enablement, products and services. Utilising powerful quantum hybrid solutions and professional service consulting, the Launch service helps customers solve complex problems and deliver real business value.</p>
<p dir="ltr">D-Wave, a pioneer in the quantum industry, was the first to deliver a commercial quantum computer and is a full-stack quantum computing provider. D-Wave’s fifth generation quantum computer, Advantage™, features 5000+ qubits configured in the highly connected Pegasus topology. The company has a blue-chip customer base, counting more than twenty of the Forbes Global 2000 as customers. With its professional services-enabled application development, D-Wave is the only quantum computing company that supports business applications at production scale today.</p>
