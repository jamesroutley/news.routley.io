<h3 id="crimes-against-food">Crimes Against Food</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The Brioche Hamburger Bun:  The hamburger bun is designed to ABSORB grease, not add greasiness to the experience. A proper hamburger bun should retain its structural integrity, playing its role as delivery vehicle for the meat patty until the last bite. The brioche bun, woefully unsuitable for this role, crumbles. God is against the brioche bun</li>
  <li>The Third Slice Of Bread on a Club Sandwich: You know who invented the middle slice? Enemies of freedom. Their mission? Sap our will to live by ruining our sandwich experiences through “tectonic slide”.</li>
  <li>The Half-Assed Muffin on an Eggs Benedict: You know it. The lazy cook toasts it under the broiler for a few seconds on one side, leaving the outer surface gummy and raw tasting and lacking the textural note your poached egg and Canadian bacon and sauce desperately need.</li>
  <li>Slurry of Soy Sauce and Wasabi: If you immediately plop a big wad of wasabi into your dish of soy sauce, mix it around with your chopsticks? Your sushi chef loses all respect for you. Dip your nigiri into it rice side down? He hates you now. You may as well spit in his face. Seven years learning rice and you just shat in it.</li>
  <li>Chicken Caesar: Why? They’re going to cook the chicken to shit anyway.</li>
  <li>Truffle Oil: It’s not food. It’s not truffles. It’s lube .</li>
  <li>“Kobe Meatballs” (ditto “Kobe Burger”): if you order either of these utterly fraudulent items at a restaurant or popular gathering spot for bro’s, all I can say is I’m truly sorry about your penis.</li>

<p>Every song great. Impossible to improve on . I’ll start :</p>

<ol>
  <li>GET HAPPY—Elvis Costello</li>
  <li>FRESH SLY—Sly and the Family Stone</li>
  <li>DOGGY STYLE—Snoop Dogg</li>
  <li>ROME —Danger Mouse and Daniele Luppi</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h3 id="scary-shit">SCARY SHIT!!!</h3>

<p>Things I find genuinely terrifying :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clowns: I’m sure I’m not alone here. Were clowns ever funny? No. Of course not. They were always sinister figures, disguising their homicidal intentions under thick make-up, all the while their crawl spaces and chest freezers were brimming with Cub Scout parts .</li>
  <li>Mimes: like cats, when entering a space, they gravitate towards the one person who fears them . Their purposes are always to embarrass, to draw attention to the shy, the troubled, the hungover. Pure evil.</li>
  <li>Switzerland: I think I must have experienced some awful childhood trauma in view of a mural of snow capped peaks and Lake Geneva. I live with a persistent dread of alpine vistas, chalet architecture, Tyrolean hats, even cheese with holes in it. You will notice I have never been there. That’s because Switzerland frightens me.</li>
  <li>Karaoke:  singing in public in general . Korean karaoke is an exception. Like anything shameful, I prefer to do it in private. And after enough soju, anything is possible. Karaoke should only be performed  with people  who have already seen your genitals.</li>
  <li>Rats: Fuck snakes. I eat them. Spiders? No problem! But rats. Rats! Maybe it’s my years in the restaurant business , but the appearance of a rat was always the beginning of the end. An augur of doom.  A  poisoned rat once crawled out of a wall and flopped limply onto my foot to die. They had to scrape me off the ceiling.</li>
  <li>Also: Polka music, ukeleles, neckbeards with banjos, golf clothes—in fact golfers in general, The Real Housewives of Anywhere ( their glassy gazes, surgical addictions and single minded hunger for attention are a clear and present danger to anyone in their trajectories), pressure cookers, and Nashville Hot Chicken ( the extra hot version).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="six-true-things-about-dinner-with-obama">SIX TRUE THINGS ABOUT DINNER WITH OBAMA</h3>

<p>Bun Cha is a typical Hanoi dish, decidedly everyday, and much loved by locals . To the consternation, no doubt,  of the Secret Service (who were very cool about it) I was recently joined for dinner by the leader of the free world in a working class joint near the old quarter of town for an upcoming episode of Parts Unknown .</p>

<ol>
  <li>The President is very comfortable with chopsticks. He handled the sticky, hard to separate noodles that accompany the pork and the broth  components of Bun Cha skillfully. He even went in for seconds.</li>
  <li>The President is  an Asiaphile. He spoke wistfully of his time in Indonesia and his memories of the smells and flavors of street food there.</li>
  <li>He clearly enjoyed sitting on a low plastic stool eating bun Cha . It felt to me like his night off. Even with Secret Service lurking nearby .</li>
  <li>The reaction among regular people in Hanoi to the fact that the US President chose to eat Bun Cha was beyond all imagining. The effect was unbelievable.People were actually crying the next day, describing to me their shock and their pride, the reactions of their neighbors, to this completely unexpected choice of meal—and the venue.</li>
  <li>He was among the very few guests on my show who ever asked the camera crew if they got to eat too.And he made a point of taking a picture with all of them when we were done.</li>
  <li>I believe he enjoyed that beer.</li>

Malcom Lowry’s dense, symbolism loaded masterwork took him his whole life to write and it stood to reason that there was no way that a two hour film could ever contain its sprawling, portentous, narrative, it’s linguistic pyrotechnics.</li>

I think I was 8 or 9 when he first showed it to me and it shaped my life. he message was clear: we are all going to die. It will be funny. Also: life is filled with the absurd and hypocritical and that too can be funny.</li>
