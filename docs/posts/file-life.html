<img alt="my hand with a the File Life USB in it" data-hires="images/usb-hand.jpg" data-size="689.29 KB" loading="lazy" src="https://filelife.tours/dithered_images/usb-hand.jpg"/> As I travel, I collect files that people want to let go of. I ask each participant to delete the file they&#39;ve given me, so that the only remaining copy exists on a USB I carry. In return, I take their files on a tour of the mountains and the oceans. When the USB fills up, I will delete the files, along with this website. You could think of this website as a memorial to files.
