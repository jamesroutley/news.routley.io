          In preparation for moving to the US, I purchased traveller&#39;s health
          insurance for my wife and myself. This insurance doesn&#39;t cover
          preventative medicine, like yearly checkups and vaccines. I was
          prepared to pay out-of-pocket for the updated COVID vaccine until I
          heard about the CDC&#39;s
          <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/bridge/index.html">Bridge Access Program</a>. The program&#39;s website states, &#34;Adults 18 years and older without
          health insurance and adults whose health insurance does not cover all
          COVID-19 vaccine costs can get updated COVID-19 vaccines at no cost
          through the Bridge Access Program.&#34; However, it now seems less likely
          that my wife and I will get free vaccines under the program.
        </p>

          Yesterday, I spoke with a pharmacist at a local CVS. He told me that
          he&#39;d received instructions not to bill the Bridge Access Program for
          vaccines given to people with health insurance, even if their
          insurance doesn&#39;t cover the vaccine. It sounded like CVS corporate had
          given all pharmacies these instructions. He mentioned that a
          connection at Rite Aid received similar guidelines. Walgreens also
          participates in the Bridge Access Program but I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve
          implemented the same rule.
        </p>

          I hope this post helps other people in my situation avoid sticker
          shock when they go to get vaccinated!
