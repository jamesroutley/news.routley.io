<p><a href="http://alok.github.io/2022/11/09/dissection">My dissection post</a> is 80% of this blog&#39;s
traffic. Before writing that, 80% of traffic came from <a href="http://alok.github.io/2018/04/26/using-vim-s-conceal-to-make-languages-more-tolerable">Vim&#39;s conceal

<p>The math posts are almost never read, which is depressing because they&#39;re the
ones with the least obvious insights. The few that do read them tend to really
like them.</p>
<p>This post isn&#39;t going to buck that trend, since it won&#39;t make sense unless you
already know nonstandard analysis, and this isn&#39;t going to be the post that
teaches you nonstandard analysis either.</p>
<h2 id="claim">Claim</h2>
<p>Let $$g$$ be a graph where every finite subgraph is $$n$$-colorable. Then the whole graph $$g$$ is $$n$$ colorable.</p>
<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>
<p>If $$g$$ is finite, then the whole thing is trivial because $$g$$ is a finite subgraph of itself and is $$n$$-colorable by hypothesis, and we&#39;re done.</p>
<p>Now assume $$g$$ is infinite. Construct $$g^<em>$$, the nonstandard extension of $$g$$. It is a fact that any infinite structure can be embedded inside a larger hyperfinite one. The trick of approximating an infinite thing by a larger hyperfinite one is called <em>hyperfinite approximation</em>. In this case, we construct $$H$$, a hyperfinite subgraph of $$g^</em>$$ that contains $$g$$.</p>
<p>In symbols: $$g \subseteq H \subseteq g^*$$.</p>
<p>$$H$$ is $$n$$-colorable, because all finite subsets of $$g$$ are, so by the Transfer Principle all (hyper)finite subsets of $$g^*$$ are too, including $$H$$.</p>
<p>But $$g$$ is contained in $$H$$, so it can&#39;t require more colors than $$H$$ does. Therefore, $$g$$ is $$n$$-colorable $$\QED$$.</p>
<p>This is the Compactness Theorem in disguise because &#34;all finite substructures&#34; carry over to the whole infinite structure.</p>
