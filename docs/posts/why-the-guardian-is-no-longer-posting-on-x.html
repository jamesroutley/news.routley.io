    <h1>Why the Guardian is no longer posting on X</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>We wanted to let readers know that we will no longer post on any official Guardian editorial accounts on the social media site X (formerly Twitter). We think that the benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives and that resources could be better used promoting our journalism elsewhere.</p><p>This is something we have been considering for a while given the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/05/racism-misogyny-lies-how-did-x-become-so-full-of-hatred-and-is-it-ethical-to-keep-using-it" data-link-name="in body link">far-right conspiracy theories and racism</a>. The US presidential election campaign served only to underline what we have considered for a long time: that X is a toxic media platform and that its owner, Elon Musk, has been able to use its influence to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/04/elon-musk-x-network-donald-trump" data-link-name="in body link">shape political discourse</a>.</p><p>X users will still be able to share our articles, and the nature of live news reporting means we will still occasionally embed content from X within our article pages.</p><p>Our reporters will also be able to carry on using the site for news-gathering purposes, just as they use other social networks in which we do not officially engage.</p><p>Social media can be an important tool for news organisations and help us to reach new audiences but, at this point, X now plays a diminished role in promoting our work. Our journalism is available and open to all on our website and we would prefer people to come to <a href="http://theguardian.com" data-link-name="in body link">theguardian.com</a> and support our work there.</p><p>Thankfully, we can do this because our business model does not rely on viral content tailored to the whims of the social media giants’ algorithms – instead we’re funded directly by our readers.
