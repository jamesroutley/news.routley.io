<p>I love Longmont’s municipal broadband, but we had to fight Comcast every step of the way to get it.</p>

<p>As a gracious person, I’ll dutifully pretend that the problem <em>might be</em> on my side of the Zoom call. But the problem is never me—my internet is just too good.</p>
<p>Since 2016, I’ve been using Longmont’s municipal broadband—NextLight—and it’s been objectively awesome.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s fast—1Gbps symmetric</li>
<li>It’s cheap(ish)—$49.95 per month</li>
<li>It’s rock-solid—I’ve never had an outage</li>
<li>I’ve never hit a data cap</li>
<li>PC Magazine ranks NextLight among the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-fastest-isps-of-2021">top five ISPs in the United States</a> every year—often besting Google Fiber</li>
</ul>
<p>And, even better, the city insists I’ll pay $49.95 forever.</p>
<p><strong>But Longmont spent more than a decade fighting Comcast to provide this excellent internet</strong>. And any city working on its municipal broadband offering should prepare to do the same.</p>

<h2>🎉 Canceling Comcast <a href="#canceling-comcast">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2016, I was paying Comcast $150 a month for their top-tier (at the time) 100Mbps speeds. I could usually eke out a little more than 30Mbps on a good day.</p>
<p><strong>I lept at the chance for gigabit internet.</strong> I signed up for NextLight as a charter member—locking in $49.95/mo for life (the current price is only $69.95 last I checked). And I took the opportunity to upgrade my $20 router from 2008 at the same time.</p>

</figure>
<p>And when I returned my cable box to Comcast to cancel my service, the representative felt compelled to counsel me: “NextLight, huh? you know,” he said, leaning in, “if you miss even a single payment, they’ll raise your price?”</p>
<p>“I’ll take my chances.”</p>
<p>I’ve been automatically billed $49.95 every month since, and this is what my speed looks like this morning:</p>

<h2>🥺 Why can’t we have nice things? <a href="#why-cant-we-have-nice-things">¶</a></h2>
<p>Big cable companies suck. <strong>Big cable companies burned hundreds of thousands of dollars to stop Longmont’s municipal broadband.</strong></p>
<p>In 2005, Comcast and CenturyLink rammed through the egregious <a href="http://cityofalamosa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/152_enr.pdf">Colorado SB-05-152</a>, prohibiting municipalities in the state of Colorado from offering telecommunication services.</p>
<p>Longmont had to hold two referendums on the measure—one in 2009, which failed, and another in 2011, which passed:</p>
<p>In 2009, “<a href="https://www.boulderweekly.com/news/montanabased-org-pours-cash-into-conservative-coffers-in-longmont-city-council-race/">No Blank Check Longmont</a>” (Comcast/CenturyLink) <strong>spent $250,000</strong> to dash our dreams of municipal broadband. They framed it as a choice between fast internet vs. police and firefighters.</p>
<p>In 2011, “<a href="https://www.boulderweekly.com/news/terrifying-telecom-tale/">Look Before You Leap Longmont</a>” (Comcast/CenturyLink) <strong>spent $300,000</strong> urging us to rethink our municipal broadband plans. They stood in lone opposition to our unanimous city council and our local paper.</p>
<p>Comcast spent $500,000 in a tiny city of less than 100,000 people. You can be sure, Comcast will do all this again in a heartbeat.</p>

<h2>📓 Lessons <a href="#lessons">¶</a></h2>
<p>Rather than use their vast resources to improve their service, <strong>Comcast will spend big to ensure they never have to compete</strong>.</p>
<p>Let Longmont be a lesson. In 2011, <strong>Longmont won because it formed an honest citizens’ advisory group</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111008235441/http://www.longmontsfuture.com/">Longmont’s Future</a>. Longmont’s Future got the word out about the vote on Facebook, its website, and the local press.</p>
<p>And ever since, Longmonsters (that’s right—Longmont’s demonym is “Longmonster”) have <a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/more-half-longmonters-choose-nextlight-fiber-because-nextlight-fiber">chosen NextLight over competing services</a>.</p>
<p>Real competition won. Fuck Comcast. Long live municipal broadband.</p>
