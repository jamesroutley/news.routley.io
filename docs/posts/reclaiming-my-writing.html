    <h1>Reclaiming My Writing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I released a new tool for my blog a few days ago which also marks my first project in <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/elm-lang.org">Elm</a>. It&#39;s a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/blog.veitheller.de/blargl">editor for Markdown files</a>. I&#39;m fairly happy with it. It&#39;s simple and efficient and doesn&#39;t get in my way. Time will tell whether I actually use it to write my posts, but I consider it to be useful, at least at the moment. And I learned a bit about Elm on the way, which is a nice byproduct of the experiment.</p>

<p>I can now say that I know about the buzz of the week, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming">Functional Reactive Programming</a>. It&#39;s an interesting concept, and I read both Evan Czaplickis <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/files/archived/Czaplicki.pdf">thesis</a>–Evan is the inventor of Elm—and <a href="http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf">the Tarpit paper</a> with gusto. The latter is a bit long, but well worth the read. All the more fascinating is how much trouble I had to get this right. I am still not completely sure whether I did it the Elm way, but the end product is decent so I&#39;m more than happy.</p>
<p>Starting to program in Elm felt weird. It was not unlike that time when I first tried to program Haskell, where I learned I didn&#39;t know programming per se, but rather the tools that I have. That experience was rewarding and humbling, and I felt the same sensation when programming Elm. Of course having programmed in Haskell helped me to feel at home in the syntax, but setting up a model, events, commands, and subscriptions was not as straightforward an experience as I had hoped. And all of that <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/blog/blob/master/blargl/src/Blargl.elm">in less than 50 lines of Elm</a>. I did not have to fight with Markdown—Evan himself has written a library to do that for me—and so the programming I had to do was rather simple. The wiring of the components did not feel simple or natural for me, however, and I&#39;d say that this is mostly Javascript&#39;s fault. I&#39;ve been tainted.</p>
<h2 id="cause-and-effect">Cause and Effect</h2>
<p>Still, I could see myself programming in Elm more often in the future. The tooling is great for a language that young—certainly more advanced than what we have in zepto—and once you understand the basics of ports and models it&#39;s actually relatively smooth sailing. It felt a little verbose sometimes, but I assume that&#39;s just because I&#39;m not using the right abstractions yet. I also inlined all of the styles, which makes up more than half of the program. That I would probably do differently next time.</p>
<p>If you want to use the editor, feel free. And never mind the save button, it&#39;s not all that great yet. I&#39;ll fix that when I find the time.</p>
