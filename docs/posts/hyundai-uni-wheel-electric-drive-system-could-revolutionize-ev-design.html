    <h1>Hyundai Uni Wheel electric drive system could revolutionize EV design</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>The massive worldwide focus on <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/electric/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:0;">electric vehicle</a> technology has already introduced noteworthy changes to automobile design, notably due to the flat floor design with one large <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/battery/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:1;">battery</a> pack popularized by <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:2;">Tesla</a> and thereafter adopted by nearly every other major automaker. The reduction in size of drive components has made the term &#34;frunk&#34; part of our regular vernacular, as well. And now <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/hyundai/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:3;">Hyundai</a> and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/kia/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:4;">Kia</a> have introduced the world to what they say is the next major paradigm shift in EV architecture: the Universal Wheel Drive System, or Uni Wheel for short.</p> 
<p>Basically, the Korean automaker conglomerate has figured out a way to replace the standard constant velocity (CV) joint with an arrangement of gears that reside directly inside the wheel hub. We could do our best to explain the arrangement — the short version: a single sun gear transfers power through a pair of packaged pinion gear arms that can move independently to an outer ring gear in a unique and flexible planetary design — but it makes the most sense after looking at the pictures and especially the animated video that we&#39;ve embedded just below.</p> 
 
 
<p>Hyundai/Kia highlight many benefits to this Uni Wheel drive system. Claims include reduced packaging size, improved ride quality, greater durability and, importantly, increased efficiency. All of that means a smaller battery could provide similar range to today&#39;s EVs, that a similarly sized battery could provide greater range, or even that the space that&#39;s freed up by Uni Wheels would allow greater battery size and therefore range without requiring a larger vehicle platform.</p> 
<p>In addition to <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/electric/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:5;">electric cars</a> and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/truck/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:6;">trucks</a>, the automaker group says that Uni Wheels can be used for a large variety of mobility applications. These would include vehicles with fewer than four wheels, like scooters and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/motorcycles/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:7;">motorcycles</a>, and even wheelchairs and delivery <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/robot/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:8;">robots</a>. The automakers have reportedly applied for and registered eight patents related to Uni Wheel in South Korea as well as the United States and Europe.</p>
