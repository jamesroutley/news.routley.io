    <h1>We’ve filed a law­suit chal­leng­ing Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><nav></nav><p>Jan­u­ary 13, 2023</p><p>Hello. This is <a href="https://buttericklaw.com">Matthew Butterick</a>. I’m a writer, designer, pro­gram­mer, and law­yer. In Novem­ber 2022, I teamed up with the <a href="https://saverilawfirm.com/our-cases/">amaz­ingly excel­lent</a> class-action lit­i­ga­tors <a href="https://saverilawfirm.com/attorneys/joseph-r-saveri/">Joseph Saveri</a>, <a href="https://saverilawfirm.com/attorneys/cadio-zirpoli">Cadio Zir­poli</a>, and <a href="https://saverilawfirm.com/attorneys/travis-manfredi">Travis Man­fredi</a> at the <a href="https://saverilawfirm.com/our-cases/github-copilot-intellectual-property-investigation">Joseph Saveri Law Firm</a> to file a <a href="https://githubcopilotlitigation.com">law­suit against GitHub Copi­lot</a> for its “unprece­dented open-source soft­ware piracy”. (That law­suit is still <a href="https://githubcopilotlitigation.com">in progress</a>.)</p><p>Since then, we’ve heard from peo­ple all over the world—espe­cially writ­ers, artists, pro­gram­mers, and other cre­ators—who are con­cerned about AI sys­tems being trained on vast amounts of copy­righted work with no con­sent, no credit, and no com­pen­sa­tion.</p><p>Today, we’re tak­ing another step toward mak­ing AI fair &amp; eth­i­cal for every­one. On behalf of three won­der­ful <a href="#plaintiffs">artist plain­tiffs</a>—<a href="#sarah-andersen">Sarah Ander­sen</a>, <a href="#kelly-mckernan">Kelly McK­er­nan</a>, and <a href="#karla-ortiz">Karla Ortiz</a>—we’ve filed a class-action law­suit against <a href="#stability-ai">Sta­bil­ity AI</a>, <a href="#deviantart">DeviantArt</a>, and <a href="#midjourney">Mid­jour­ney</a> for their use of <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-announcement">Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion</a>, a 21st-cen­tury col­lage tool that remixes the copy­righted works of mil­lions of artists whose work was used as train­ing data.</p><p>Join­ing as co-coun­sel are the ter­rific lit­i­ga­tors <a href="https://www.locklaw.com/professionals/brian-d-clark/">Brian Clark</a> and <a href="https://www.locklaw.com/professionals/laura-m-matson/">Laura Mat­son</a> of <a href="https://www.locklaw.com/">Lock­ridge Grindal Nauen P.L.L.P.</a></p><p>Today’s fil­ings:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://stablediffusionlitigation.com/pdf/00201/1-1-stable-diffusion-complaint.pdf">Class-action com­plaint</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://stablediffusionlitigation.com/pdf/00201/1-1-stable-diffusion-complaint-exhibits.pdf">Class-action com­plaint: Exhibits</a></p></li></ul><p>As a law­yer who is also a <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com">long­time mem­ber</a> of the visual-arts com­mu­nity, it’s an honor to stand up on behalf of fel­low artists and con­tinue this vital con­ver­sa­tion about how AI will coex­ist with human cul­ture and cre­ativ­ity.</p><p>The image-gen­er­a­tor com­pa­nies have made their views clear. </p><p><a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-announcement">Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion</a> is an arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence (AI) soft­ware prod­uct, released in August 2022 by a com­pany called <a href="https://stability.ai">Sta­bil­ity AI</a>.</p><p>Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion con­tains unau­tho­rized copies of mil­lions—and pos­si­bly bil­lions—of copy­righted images. These copies were made with­out the knowl­edge or con­sent of the artists.</p><p>Even assum­ing nom­i­nal dam­ages of $1 per image, the value of this mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion would be roughly $5 bil­lion. (For com­par­i­son, the largest art heist ever was the 1990 <a href="https://gardnermuseum.org/organization/theft">theft of 13 art­works</a>  from the <a href="https://gardnermuseum.org/">Isabella Stew­art Gard­ner Museum</a>, with a cur­rent esti­mated value of $500 mil­lion.)</p><p>Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion belongs to a cat­e­gory of AI sys­tems called <em>gen­er­a­tive AI</em>. These sys­tems are trained on a cer­tain kind of cre­ative work—for instance text, soft­ware code, or images—and then remix these works to derive (or “gen­er­ate”) more works of the same kind.</p><p>Hav­ing copied the five bil­lion images—with­out the con­sent of the orig­i­nal artists—Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion relies on a math­e­mat­i­cal process called <a href="#the-problem-with-diffusion"><em>dif­fu­sion</em></a> to store com­pressed copies of these train­ing images, which in turn are recom­bined to derive other images. It is, in short, a 21st-cen­tury col­lage tool.</p><p>These result­ing images <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03860.pdf">may or may not</a> out­wardly resem­ble the train­ing images. Nev­er­the­less, they are derived from copies of the train­ing images, and com­pete with them in the mar­ket­place. At min­i­mum, Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion’s abil­ity to flood the mar­ket with an essen­tially unlim­ited num­ber of infring­ing images will inflict per­ma­nent dam­age on the mar­ket for art and artists.</p><p>Even Sta­bil­ity AI CEO Emad Mostaque <a href="https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1603390169192833027">has fore­cast that</a> “[f]uture [AI] mod­els will be fully licensed”. But Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion is not. It is a par­a­site that, if allowed to pro­lif­er­ate, will cause irrepara­ble harm to artists, now and in the future.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-diffusion"><a href="#the-problem-with-diffusion">The prob­lem with dif­fu­sion</a></h2><p>The dif­fu­sion tech­nique was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585">invented in 2015</a> by AI researchers at Stan­ford Uni­ver­sity. The dia­gram below, taken from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585">Stan­ford team’s research</a>, illus­trates the two phases of the dif­fu­sion process using a spi­ral as the exam­ple train­ing image.</p><p><img src="https://stablediffusionlitigation.com/img/spirals.gif"/></p><p>The first phase in dif­fu­sion is to take an image and pro­gres­sively add more visual noise to it in a series of steps. (This process is depicted in the top row of the dia­gram.) At each step, the AI records how the addi­tion of noise changes the image. By the last step, the image has been “dif­fused” into essen­tially ran­dom noise.</p><p>The sec­ond phase is like the first, but in reverse. (This process is depicted in the bot­tom row of the dia­gram, which  <strong>reads right to left</strong>.) Hav­ing recorded the steps that turn a cer­tain image into noise, the AI can run those steps back­wards. Start­ing with some ran­dom noise, the AI applies the steps in reverse. By remov­ing noise (or “denois­ing”) the data, the AI will emit a copy of the orig­i­nal image.</p><p>In the dia­gram, the recon­structed spi­ral (in red) has some fuzzy parts in the lower half that the orig­i­nal spi­ral (in blue) does not. Though the red spi­ral is plainly a copy of the blue spi­ral, in com­puter terms it would be called a <em>lossy</em> copy, mean­ing some details are lost in trans­la­tion. This is true of numer­ous dig­i­tal data for­mats, includ­ing MP3 and JPEG, that also make highly com­pressed copies of dig­i­tal data by omit­ting small details.</p><p>In short, dif­fu­sion is a way for an AI pro­gram to fig­ure out how to recon­struct a copy of the train­ing data through denois­ing. Because this is so, in copy­right terms it’s no dif­fer­ent from an MP3 or JPEG—a way of stor­ing a com­pressed copy of cer­tain dig­i­tal data.</p><h3 id="interpolating-with-latent-images"><a href="#interpolating-with-latent-images">Inter­po­lat­ing with latent images</a></h3><p>In 2020, the dif­fu­sion tech­nique <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">was improved</a> by researchers at UC Berke­ley in two ways:</p><ol><li><p>They showed how a dif­fu­sion model could store its train­ing images in a more com­pressed for­mat with­out impact­ing its abil­ity to recon­struct high-fidelity copies. These com­pressed copies of train­ing images are known as <em>latent images</em>.</p></li><li><p>They found that these latent images could be inter­po­lated—mean­ing, blended math­e­mat­i­cally—to pro­duce new deriv­a­tive images.</p></li></ol><p>The dia­gram below, taken from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">Berke­ley team’s research</a>, shows how this process works.</p><p><img src="https://stablediffusionlitigation.com/img/latent-interpolation.gif"/></p><p>The image in the red frame has been inter­po­lated from the two “Source” images pixel by pixel. It looks like two translu­cent face images stacked on top of each other, not a sin­gle con­vinc­ing face.</p><p><span><img src="https://stablediffusionlitigation.com/img/detail-red.gif"/></span> <span><img src="https://stablediffusionlitigation.com/img/detail-green.gif"/></span></p><p>The image in the green frame has been gen­er­ated dif­fer­ently. In that case, the two source images have been com­pressed into latent images. Once these latent images have been inter­po­lated, this newly inter­po­lated latent image has been recon­structed into pix­els using the denois­ing process. Com­pared to the pixel-by-pixel inter­po­la­tion, the advan­tage is appar­ent: the inter­po­la­tion based on latent images looks like a sin­gle con­vinc­ing human face, not an over­lay of two faces.</p><p>Despite the dif­fer­ence in results, in copy­right terms, these two modes of inter­po­la­tion are equiv­a­lent: they both gen­er­ate deriv­a­tive works by inter­po­lat­ing two source images.</p><h3 id="conditioning-with-text-prompts"><a href="#conditioning-with-text-prompts">Con­di­tion­ing with text prompts</a></h3><p>In 2022, the dif­fu­sion tech­nique <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10752.pdf">was fur­ther improved</a> by researchers in Munich. These researchers fig­ured out how to shape the denois­ing process with extra infor­ma­tion. This process is called <em>con­di­tion­ing</em>. (One of these researchers, Robin Rom­bach, is now employed by Sta­bil­ity AI as a devel­oper of Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion.)</p><p>The most com­mon tool for con­di­tion­ing is short text descrip­tions, also known as <em>text prompts</em>, that describe ele­ments of the image, e.g.—“a dog wear­ing a base­ball cap while eat­ing ice cream”. (Result shown at right.) This gave rise to the dom­i­nant inter­face of Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion and other AI image gen­er­a­tors: con­vert­ing a text prompt into an image.</p><p>The text-prompt inter­face serves another pur­pose, how­ever. It cre­ates a layer of mag­i­cal mis­di­rec­tion that makes it harder for users to coax out obvi­ous copies of the train­ing images (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03860.pdf">though not impos­si­ble</a>). Nev­er­the­less, because all the visual infor­ma­tion in the sys­tem is derived from the copy­righted train­ing images, the images emit­ted—regard­less of out­ward appear­ance—are nec­es­sar­ily works derived from those train­ing images.</p><h2 id="the-defendants"><a href="#the-defendants">The defen­dants</a></h2><h3 id="stability-ai" id="stability-ai"><a href="#stability-ai">Sta­bil­ity AI</a></h3><p><a href="https://stability.ai/">Sta­bil­ity AI</a>, founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/EMostaque/">Emad Mostaque</a>, is based in Lon­don.</p><p>Sta­bil­ity AI funded <a href="https://laion.ai/">LAION</a>, a Ger­man orga­ni­za­tion that is cre­at­ing ever-larger image datasets—with­out con­sent, credit, or com­pen­sa­tion to the orig­i­nal artists—for use by AI com­pa­nies.</p><p>Sta­bil­ity AI is the devel­oper of <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-announcement">Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion</a>. Sta­bil­ity AI trained Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion using the LAION dataset.</p><p>Sta­bil­ity AI also released <a href="https://dreamstudio.ai/">Dream­Stu­dio</a>, a paid app that pack­ages Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion in a web inter­face.</p><h3 id="deviantart" id="deviantart"><a href="#deviantart">DeviantArt</a></h3><p><a href="https://deviantart.com/">DeviantArt</a> was founded in 2000 and has long been one of the largest artist com­mu­ni­ties on the web.</p><p>As shown by <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/5/laion-aesthetics-weeknotes/">Simon Willi­son and Andy Baio</a>, thou­sands—and prob­a­bly closer to mil­lions—of images in LAION were <a href="https://laion-aesthetic.datasette.io/laion-aesthetic-6pls/domain?_sort=id&amp;domain__contains=deviantart">copied from DeviantArt</a> and used to train Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion.</p><p>Rather than stand up for its com­mu­nity of artists by pro­tect­ing them against AI train­ing, DeviantArt instead chose to release <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/dreamup">DreamUp</a>, a paid app built around Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion. In turn, a flood of AI-gen­er­ated art has inun­dated DeviantArt, crowd­ing out human artists.</p><p>When con­fronted about the ethics and legal­ity of these maneu­vers dur­ing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2R7f2ZGLYs">live Q&amp;A ses­sion</a> in Novem­ber 2022, mem­bers of the DeviantArt man­age­ment team, includ­ing CEO Moti Levy, could not explain why they betrayed their artist com­mu­nity by embrac­ing Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion, while inten­tion­ally vio­lat­ing their own terms of ser­vice and pri­vacy pol­icy.</p><h3 id="midjourney" id="midjourney"><a href="#midjourney">Mid­jour­ney</a></h3><p>Mid­jour­ney was founded in 2021 by David Holz in San Fran­cisco.
