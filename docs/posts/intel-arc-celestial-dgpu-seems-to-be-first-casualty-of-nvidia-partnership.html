	<p>While we haven’t heard anything of substance regarding Intel’s high-end Arc Battlemage B770 desktop GPU for months now, the GPU is reportedly alive and coming this quarter. The information, which comes to us courtesy of Moore’s Law Is Dead, confirms <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Arc-B770-16-GB-GPU-has-not-been-scrapped-just-yet.1010208.0.html" target="_self">a leak from back in May 2025</a>.</p><p>MLID’s latest leak, which also reveals the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-x-Nvidia-Hammer-Lake-leaks-with-large-and-powerful-iGPU-as-Intel-shifts-Titan-Lake-to-mobile-only.1118950.0.html" target="_self">Intel x Nvidia Hammer Lake and Titan Lake APUs</a>, delivers some noteworthy specs updates for the Arc B770. Contrary to what the leaker posted in October 2024, the Intel Arc B770 now seems to be skipping PCIe 5.0 support. Moreover, the board is also alleged to have inconsistent performance with “frame pacing issues”.</p><p>So, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9BdITGw9pY" target="_blank">MLID still maintains</a> that the Arc B770 will feature 32 Xe cores, a 256-bit wide bus, and is capable of reaching RTX 4070 level, the card will reportedly suffer from choppy performance and have a limited supply. What’s even sadder, however, is that Arc B770 could be the last Intel desktop GPU.</p><p>Per MLID&#39;s sources, Intel has pulled the Celestial dGPU from its roadmap. This effectively points to the desktop Arc Celestial cards being canceled. If Intel does cancel <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-s-next-gen-Arc-Celestial-GPUs-may-feature-GDDR7-memory.1002585.0.html" target="_self">Arc Celestial</a> and, by extension, later GPU architectures like <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Nova-Lake-S-iGPU-leaks-with-Xe3-Celestial-and-Xe4-Druid-architectures.1030175.0.html" target="_self">Arc Druid</a>, it will effectively put an end to what can only be categorized as a shaky and often rudderless business.</p></div><div id="c14459712">
