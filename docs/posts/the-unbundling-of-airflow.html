Products start small, in time, add adjacent verticals and functionality to their offerings and end up becoming a <strong>platform</strong>. Once these platforms become big enough, people start to figure out how to better serve neglected verticals or abstract out functionality in order to break it down into purpose-built chunks, and <em>the unbundling starts</em>. The most classic example of this is the unbundling of Craigslist. You have probably seen a version of this diagram on the internet somewhere:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.fal.ai/content/images/2022/02/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="540" height="361"/><figcaption><em><em>image credit: </em></em>acrowdedspace.com</figcaption></figure><p>In data world, it&#39;s hard to figure out what makes a platform, but luckily some tools self-advertise themselves as such. Airflow is one of them:</p><blockquote><strong>Airflow is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.</strong></blockquote><p>One might consider Airflow a workflow manager, but undoubtedly the flexibility of the product allowed it to take on additional responsibilities. Heavy users of Airflow can do a vast variety of data related tasks without leaving the platform; from extract and load scripts to generating reports, transformations with Python and SQL to syncing back data to BI tools. </p><p>Before the fragmentation of the data stack, it wasn’t uncommon to create end-to-end pipelines with Airflow. Organizations used to build almost entire data workflows as custom scripts developed by in-house data engineers. Bigger companies even built their own frameworks inside Airflow, for example frameworks with dbt-like functionality for SQL transformations in order to make it easier for data analysts to write these pipelines.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.fal.ai/content/images/2022/02/box_around_legend.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1375" srcset="https://blog.fal.ai/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/box_around_legend.png 600w, https://blog.fal.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/box_around_legend.png 1000w, https://blog.fal.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/box_around_legend.png 1600w, https://blog.fal.ai/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/box_around_legend.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>A data pipeline built with Airflow</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/144F-R_En5E_g5pHYxSvv8XC2Z20488uF/view?usp=sharing">Hi-Res Link</a></p><p>Today, data practitioners have many tools under their belt and only very rarely they have to reach for a tool like Airflow. <a href="https://www.fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a> and <a href="https://airbyte.com/">Airbyte</a> took care of the extract and load scripts that one might write with Airflow. <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> came for the data transformations, <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/">Census</a> and <a href="https://hightouch.io/">Hightouch</a> for Reverse ETL. Metrics and experimentation layers are also getting their own focused tooling; metrics with tools like <a href="https://transform.co/">Transform</a>, <a href="https://metriql.com/">Metriql</a>, <a href="https://www.supergrain.com/">Supergrain</a>  and experimentation with <a href="https://www.geteppo.com/">Eppo</a>. <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/KarthikMurugesan2/airbnbs-ml-platform-bighead">Certain companies relied on Airflow for data science and ML workloads,</a> but with the popularity of MLOps, that layer is also being abstracted out. Open source tools like <a href="https://feast.dev/">Feast</a> are unbundling best practices for feature management that used to exist as independent Python scripts. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.fal.ai/content/images/2022/02/Group-112.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1429" srcset="https://blog.fal.ai/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/Group-112.png 600w, https://blog.fal.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/Group-112.png 1000w, https://blog.fal.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/Group-112.png 1600w, https://blog.fal.ai/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/Group-112.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>The Unbundling of Airflow</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1btZ0yck9SdgsUdNom0WXgHcSQvOJdcGR/view?usp=sharing">Hi-Res Link</a></p><p>If the unbundling of Airflow means all the heavy lifting is done by separate tools, what is left behind?</p><p>The missing gap is that we still don’t have a good solution for things that need to happen in non-SQL languages. For example, adding pandas data transformations within a dbt DAG is still a non-trivial task. Another example is the <a href="https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/from-rows-to-people">entity resolution scenario</a> that Tristian from dbt Labs points out. It is also very common to have Python nodes in a DAG that are not transformations. Such nodes might calculate risky users with an ML model, write predictions to a table that is then further processed by SQL transformations. We are working on this problem at <a href="https://blog.fal.ai/the-unbundling-of-airflow-2/www.fal.ai">Features and Labels</a> by <a href="https://github.com/fal-ai/fal">adding bilingual support to dbt</a>.</p><p>Another big responsibility is scheduling, but this is a relatively simple task. EL is usually the starting point of a data pipeline so I can see EL tools (or even dbt Cloud) taking this on without Airflow. People really like the Airflow UI, it provides a holistic view of the whole system to easily discover what has failed, and re-run jobs when necessary. This is a valid point, but the holistic view has diminishing returns as more complexity is moved inside other tools. For example if an Airflow workflow is invoking a complicated dbt Cloud job the complexity of the dbt DAG is not observable from the Airflow UI.</p><p>Then there are tools that are trying to become a better Airflow by making it easier to deploy tasks or being more scalable or containerized or asset driven... It’s hard to make predictions in the ever evolving data landscape, but I am not sure if we need a better Airflow. Building a better Airflow feels like trying to optimize writing code that shouldn’t have been written in the first place.</p><p>A diverse set of tools is unbundling Airflow and this diversity is causing substantial fragmentation in modern data stack. Like everyone else, I also predict some consolidation of these tools in the coming years. I believe dbt Cloud is the best positioned place for this consolidation to happen.
