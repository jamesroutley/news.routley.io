<p>Analog is a physical companion for your digital tools that helps you prioritize and focus on your most important tasks.</p>
<p>How many times have you taken out your phone to check your to-do list only to find yourself pulled into the black hole of digital distractions?</p>
<p>Digital apps are great for capturing things, but they’re not great at helping us put those things into action.</p>
