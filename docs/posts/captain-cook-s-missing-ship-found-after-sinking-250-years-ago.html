    <h1>Captain Cook&#39;s missing ship found after sinking 250 years ago</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><p>The remains of captain <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cook">Cook</a>’s ship, <em>HMS Endeavour</em>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/san-joe-galleon-ship-wreck-treasure-found-photos-b2768027.html">has been located</a> off the US coast after sinking 250 years ago. </p><p>Between 1768 and 1771, the ship became the first European <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/vessel">vessel</a> to reach eastern Australia. It was then sold and renamed the Lord <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sandwich">Sandwich</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/colombia-shipwreck-san-jose-treasure-found-b2445500.html">before sinking off the US coast</a> during the American War of Independence in 1778. </p><p>For<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/france-shipwreck-mediterranean-deepest-archaeology-b2769450.html"> centuries the ship was lost</a>, but now the wreck has been found in Newport Harbour, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rhode-island">Rhode Island</a>. </p><p>The finding was announced in a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://cms-web.seamuseum.net/sites/default/files/2025-05/australian-national-maritime-museum-locating-hmb-endeavour-final-report-2025_0.pdf">new report</a> by the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM) and experts have identified the wreck as RI 2394. </p><p>Daryl Karp, Museum director explained the findings in the report are the result of 25 years of archaeological research and underwater investigations. </p><div><figure><div data-gallery-length="2"><p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/17/7/38/Screenshot-2025-06-17-at-08-44-33.png" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/17/7/38/Screenshot-2025-06-17-at-08-44-33.png?quality=75&amp;width=320&amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/17/7/38/Screenshot-2025-06-17-at-08-44-33.png?quality=75&amp;width=640&amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Edward Fage, [Newport and its environs, ca. 1778], William L.

The size of all the timber scantlings are almost identical to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/endeavour"><em>Endeavour</em></a>, and I’m talking within millimetres - not inches, but millimetres. </p><p>“The stem scarf is identical, absolutely identical. This stem scarf is also a very unique feature - we’ve gone through a whole bunch of 18th-century ship’s plans, and we can’t find anything else like it.” </p><p>The ship was used for British troop transport and a prison ship in the American War of Independence. In this time, it was renamed Lord Sandwich. </p><p>When American and French besieged Newport Harbour the ship was one of 13 vessels deliberately sunk to act as a submerged blockage. It was never salvaged and remained sank. </p><div><figure><div data-gallery-length="2"><p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/17/7/47/Screenshot-2025-06-17-at-08-45-10.png" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/17/7/47/Screenshot-2025-06-17-at-08-45-10.png?quality=75&amp;width=320&amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/17/7/47/Screenshot-2025-06-17-at-08-45-10.png?quality=75&amp;width=640&amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Mosaic showing frame and scuttling hole beneath letter board, north is at bottom of image (John D.

Anything that was of value would have been taken out of the ship before it sank. </p><p>However, everything experts have found so far is indicative of the 18th century. </p><p>The finding comes after a preliminary report in 2022, identified the same wreck as the <em>HMS Endeavour</em>. But it was met with criticism by the museum’s research partners, the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) who said the finding was “premature” and a “breach of contract”, claiming that it was the lead organisation for the study, The Telegraph reported. </p><p>In a statement, ANMM said it was not ruling out other candidate shipwreck sites. </p></div></div>
