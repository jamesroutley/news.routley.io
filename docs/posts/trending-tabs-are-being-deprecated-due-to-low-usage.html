<p dir="auto">I&#39;ve used both <code>Explore</code> and <code>Trending</code> and Trending is <strong>by far</strong> my favorite source for popular repositories.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just opening the trending tab, clicking on <code>CodeEdit</code> and looking at their screenshots, features, community discussions and giving it a ride on my local machine is an amazing feat of github and the spirit of the open source community.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then heading back to trending to open the next one, i.e. <code>sqlmodel</code>, checking their docs and code examples. One of the projects which I immediately recommended to a friend for one of his python project. I would&#39;ve not discovered this as I don&#39;t dabble with python projects and the <code>Explore</code> algorithm would&#39;ve never recommended me <code>sqlmodel</code> either.</p>
<p dir="auto">Head back, open the next project, checkout their website, their source code.</p>
<p dir="auto">It&#39;s still my daily routine after years on this platform and it&#39;s my favorite thing to do in the morning when I start to work.</p>
<p dir="auto">And think about it, if you don&#39;t have trending tab, whats the reason to keep the <code>Star Repo</code> feature at all?</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Please reconsider this</strong> and listen to your community and the voices in this thread.</p>
