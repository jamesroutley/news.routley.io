				<p>I’ve built and thrown away more personal blogs than I’ve written blog posts. Maybe this time will be different!</p>
<h3 id="tech-stack">Tech stack</h3>
<p>This blog is a lightly-customized clone of the <a href="https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/blog?on=github">Astro blog template</a> and is hosted and deployed using <a href="https://vercel.com/dashboard">Vercel</a>. I may later manage content with a headless CMS, but at the moment I’m authoring posts in markdown (or <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">mdx</a>) and using Astro’s static site generation.</p>
<p>I find the abundance of full-stack web frameworks to be both overwhelming and exciting (espcially coming from mobile development). I’m heartened by the industry-wide adoption of <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> because I’m not sure how to be productive in the long term when using dynamically-typed languages.</p>
<p>After puttering around with <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, <a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a>, and a few other frameworks (meta-frameworks?), I decided to move forward with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>, which I learned about on an episode of the <a href="https://devtools.fm/episode/14">devtools.fm podcast</a>. This wasn’t a paricularly well-considered decision; I mainly just wanted to throw something online. (I practice vibe-driven-development.) <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> and <a href="https://fresh.deno.dev/">fresh</a> are also on my list of web technologies to explore.</p>
<p>The blog’s title comes from one of my favorite Unicode codepoints, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_joiner">zero width joiner (U+200D)</a>.</p>
