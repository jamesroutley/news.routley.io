<div><p>In early 2022 I received an email from <a href="https://www.guillaumelion.be/english.html" target="_blank">Guillaume Lion</a>, a young filmmaker based in Brussels, Belgium. Having read Low-tech Magazine for several years, Guillaume <a href="https://www.guillaumelion.be/comics/" target="_blank">recently started making comics</a>, which he considers low-tech cinema. He proposed to visit me in Barcelona and make a portrait of me. I have never taken myself too seriously, so Guillaume came by later that year. The comic originally appeared in French in the <a href="https://medor.coop" target="_blank">Belgian magazine Médor</a> and was translated by Mira Matthew.</p>

<p>Hey Kris,</p>
<p>maybe you can’t fight the wind and win but thank you for fighting it nonetheless for us all and reminding us that a different world is possible. And who knows, maybe in a fucked up future humanity will need your articles more than you realize now. Anyway, keep up the good fight!</p>
<p>Thank you
Michael</p>

<h3>What if We Replace Guns and Bullets with Bows and Arrows?</h3>
<p>The bicycle and the bow are both highly efficient, human-powered technologies that could substitute for two very harmful alternatives: the car and the firearm. Why do we promote one but not the other?</p>

<h3>When Lethal Weapons Grew on Trees</h3>
<p>While manufacturing modern firearms and bullets depends on a global supply chain and fossil fuels, bows and arrows can be made anywhere out of anything, using only human power and simple hand tools.</p>
