    <h1>WinDirStat â€“ Windows Directory Statistics</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page"><p>WinDirStat is a disk usage statistics viewer and cleanup tool for various versions of <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong>.</p><p>Please visit the <a href="https://blog.windirstat.net">WinDirStat blog</a> for more up-to-date information about the program.</p><p>On start up, it reads the whole directory tree once and then presents it in three useful views:</p><ul><li>The directory list, which resembles the tree view of the Windows Explorer but is sorted by file/subtree size,</li><li>The treemap, which shows the whole contents of the directory tree straight away,</li><li>The extension list, which serves as a legend and shows statistics about the file types.</li></ul><img src="https://windirstat.net/images/windirstat.jpg" alt="Screenshot"/><p>The treemap represents each file as a colored rectangle, the area of which is proportional to the file&#39;s size. The rectangles are arranged in such a way, that directories again make up rectangles, which contain all their files and subdirectories. So their area is proportional to the size of the subtrees. The color of a rectangle indicates the type of the file, as shown in the extension list. The cushion shading additionally brings out the directory structure. </p></div></div>
