    <h1>Some of the error messages produced by Apple&#39;s MPW C compiler (2006)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>
These are some of the error messages produced by Apple&#39;s MPW C
compiler. These are all real. (If you must know I was bored one
afternoon and decompiled the String resources for the compiler.) The
compiler is 324k in size so these are just an excerpt I hope. I&#39;m not
sure where I stand on the copyright issue.</p><ul>
<li>&#34;String literal too long (I let you have 512 characters, that&#39;s 3 more 
than ANSI said I should)&#34;

</li><li>&#34;...And the lord said, &#39;lo, there shall only be case or default labels 
inside a switch statement&#39;&#34;

</li><li>&#34;a typedef name was a complete surprise to me at this point in your program&#34;

</li><li>&#34;&#39;Volatile&#39; and &#39;Register&#39; are not miscible&#34;

</li><li>&#34;You can&#39;t modify a constant, float upstream, win an argument with the IRS,
or satisfy this compiler&#34;

</li><li>&#34;This struct already has a perfectly good definition&#34;

</li><li>&#34;type in (cast) must be scalar; ANSI 3.3.4; page 39,
lines 10-11 (I know you don&#39;t care, I&#39;m just trying to annoy you)&#34;

</li><li>&#34;Can&#39;t cast a void type to type void (because the ANSI spec. says so, 
that&#39;s why)&#34;

</li><li>&#34;Huh ?&#34;

</li><li>&#34;can&#39;t go mucking with a &#39;void *&#39;&#34;

</li><li>&#34;we already did this function&#34;

</li><li>&#34;This label is the target of a goto from outside of the block containing this 
label AND this block has an automatic variable with an initializer AND your
window wasn&#39;t wide enough to read this whole error message&#34;

</li><li>&#34;Call me paranoid but finding &#39;/*&#39; inside this comment makes me suspicious&#34;

</li><li>&#34;Too many errors on one line (make fewer)&#34;

</li><li>&#34;Symbol table full - fatal heap error; please go buy a RAM upgrade from
your local Apple dealer&#34;
