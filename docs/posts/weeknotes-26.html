<li>very tired at the end of this week. hoping i&#39;m not getting sick.</li>
<li>this might be a quick one as a result, just getting something out there to appease my <a href="https://beeminder.com">bee overlords</a>.</li>
<li>my neighbours are playing ballads i don&#39;t know loud enough for me to make out the lyrics at midnight which is always fun. lots of synths going on.</li>
<li>turned off as soon as i finished writing that paragraph, that&#39;s manifesting babes üíÖüèø</li>
<li>this week was quick but in a &#34;lots of plot&#34; way, so i fully feel like it&#39;s about to be Saturday and enough stuff has happened for once.</li>
<li>maybe i&#39;ll write a blog post this week to try and get into a rhythm before the new year!</li>
<li>the most wonderful time of the year approaches, aka planning season!! let me know what your hopes and dreams are, please. contemplating doing a review of last year&#39;s hopes, but i kinda like moving in silence in this one distinct way lol!</li>
<li>i work on personal projects at a glacial speed and it will never not annoy me. pick up the pace!!! i have videos and blog posts and coding projects i want to do. gotta go fast!</li>
<li>to be more fair and compassionate to myself we all work at our own speed, and i guess being more congratulatory to myself over what i do achieve will help in the long run. but damn is that hard to think in the moment.</li>
