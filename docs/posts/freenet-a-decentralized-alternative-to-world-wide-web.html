    <h1>Freenet: A decentralized alternative to world wide web</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>The centralization of the internet poses a fundamental threat to individual freedom. In 2024, a few
corporations control most of our online services and infrastructure, wielding immense power with
little accountability. They can censor content, exploit data, and exclude users from essential
services, undermining democracy. We need a solution urgently.</p><p>Introducing Freenet—a decentralized replacement for the World Wide Web. Acting as a global, shared
computing platform, Freenet can be accessed via a standard web browser or embedded into software via
an API.</p><p>Freenet enables new solutions to old problems like spam,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DDoS</a>, keeping private data private, and
much more.</p><p>Freenet is flexible enough to build entirely decentralized alternatives to existing centralized
services, such as messaging, social media, email, and e-commerce. Every component of every service
built on Freenet is interoperable by default, ensuring seamless integration and interaction across
the platform. Services are also scalable by default and secured through modern cryptographic
techniques, putting control back in the hands of users, not tech oligarchs.</p><h4 id="useful-links">Useful Links</h4><h3 id="news">News</h3><ul><li><strong>October 11, 2024</strong> -
