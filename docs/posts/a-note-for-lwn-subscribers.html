    <h1>A note for LWN subscribers</h1>

           <div><b>Did you know...?</b><p>LWN.net is a subscriber-supported publication; we rely on subscribers
       to keep the entire operation going.  Please help out by <a href="https://lwn.net/subscribe/">buying a subscription</a> and keeping LWN on the
       net.</p></div>
           </center>
           <p>
January 22, 2022 will be the 24th anniversary of the publication of <a href="https://lwn.net/1998/0122/">the first LWN.net Weekly Edition</a>.  A lot has
happened in the intervening years; the Linux community has grown
immeasurably, and LWN has grown with it.  Later this year will also be the
20th anniversary of the adoption of our subscription-based model, which has
sustained LWN ever since.  There is a change coming for our subscribers
that will, with luck, help to set up LWN to thrive in the coming years.
</p><p>
The nominal price for an LWN subscription is $7 per month, a price that has
remained unchanged since 2010.  That $7 buys a lot less now than it did
twelve years ago.  Your editor is reliably informed by the Internet that
inflation in the US has been just under 28% from 2010 until the middle of
2021; that rate
doesn&#39;t include the last few months.  Prices for some things, most notably
health insurance in the US, have increased by rather more than that.
</p><p>
The bottom line is that the time has come to ask LWN subscribers to give us
a little more.  Indeed, perhaps it is past time, but we have been hesitant
to ask more of a community that has been so supportive for the last
20 years.  There comes a point, though, where things need to be
brought back into balance, and this is that point.
</p><p>
Thus, starting February 1, the nominal rate for an LWN subscription will
increase to $9/month, which is almost exactly in line with that mid-2021 
inflation rate.  There will be similar changes to subscriptions at the
&#34;starving hacker&#34; and &#34;project leader&#34; levels, which will be $5
and $16 per month, respectively.  We are
leaving the price for our &#34;maniacal supporter&#34; subscriptions the same; we
greatly appreciate the generosity of those of you who have chosen to
support us at that level and do not feel like we could ask for more.
</p><p>
Subscriptions purchased prior to that date will, of course, remain good for
the covered period.  Subscribers paying monthly will continue to be billed
for the old rate for the number of months of authorized charges they had
remaining as of the posting of this article (up to one year), after which
the new rate will apply.  Rates for 
group subscriptions will also be changing; the new rates will be
communicated at renewal time.
</p><p>
Our goal has always been for an LWN subscription to be both essential and
affordable; we believe that this remains the case even at the new rates.
Meanwhile, the increased revenue will help us as we work to increase staff
and position LWN for the next 24 years.  The Linux and free-software
communities have a lot of work to do yet; our plan is for LWN to be part of
that process.
</p><p>
LWN&#39;s subscription model was relatively rare at the time we adopted it, and
it was far from clear whether it would succeed.  The degree of its success
has been somewhat uneven over the years but, in recent times, LWN has been
on a solid (if understaffed) financial footing.  The subscription model has
indeed succeeded 
in keeping LWN around, and it ensures that our interests are aligned with
those of our readers — and not with advertisers.  It works because all of
you have chosen to support us, and for that we are deeply grateful.  Thank
you, again, for your support; we would not have been here all this time
without you.<br clear="all"/></p><hr/><p>
