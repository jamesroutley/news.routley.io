<p><span data-contrast="auto">This first wave of Copilot+ PCs is just the beginning. Over the past year, we have seen an incredible pace of innovation of AI in the cloud with Copilot allowing us to do things that we never dreamed possible. Now, we begin a new chapter with AI innovation on the device. We have completely reimagined the entirety of the PC – from silicon to the operating system, the application layer to the cloud </span><span data-contrast="auto">–</span><span data-contrast="auto"> with AI at the center, marking the most significant change to the Window platform in decades. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">The fastest, most secure Windows PCs ever built</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p>We introduced an all-new system architecture to bring the power of the CPU, GPU, and now a new high performance Neural Processing Unit (NPU) together. Connected to and enhanced by the large language models (LLMs) running in our Azure Cloud in concert with small language models (SLMs), Copilot+ PCs can now achieve a level of performance never seen before. They are up to 20x more powerful<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> and up to 100x as efficient<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> for running AI workloads and deliver industry-leading AI acceleration. They outperform Apple’s MacBook Air 15” by up to 58% in sustained multithreaded performance<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, all while delivering all-day battery life.  With incredible efficiency, Copilot+ PCs can deliver up to 22 hours of local video playback or 15 hours of web browsing on a single charge.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> That is up to 20% more battery in local video playback than the MacBook Air 15”.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Windows now has the best implementation of apps on the fastest chip, starting with Qualcomm. We now offer more native Arm64 experiences than ever before, including our fastest implementation of Microsoft 365 apps like Teams, PowerPoint, Outlook, Word, Excel, OneDrive and OneNote. Chrome, Spotify, Zoom, WhatsApp, Blender, Affinity Suite, DaVinci Resolve and many more now run​ natively on Arm to give you great performance with additional apps, like Slack, releasing later this year. In fact, 87% of the total app minutes people spend in apps today have native Arm versions.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> With a powerful new emulator, Prism, your apps run great, whether native or emulated.</p>
<p>Every Copilot+ PC comes secured out of the box. The Microsoft Pluton Security processor will be enabled by default on all Copilot+ PCs and we have introduced a number of new features, updates and defaults to Windows 11 that make it easy for users to stay secure. And, we’ve built in personalized privacy controls to help you protect what’s important to you. You can read more about how we are making Windows more secure <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/?p=134243">here</a>.</p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Entirely new, powerful AI experiences </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Copilot+ PCs leverage powerful processors and multiple state-of-the-art AI models, including several of Microsoft’s world-class SLMs, to unlock a new set of experiences you can run locally, directly on the device. This removes previous limitations on things like latency, cost and even privacy to help you be more productive, creative and communicate more effectively.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Recall instantly</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We set out to solve one of the most frustrating problems we encounter daily – finding something we know we have seen before on our PC. Today, we must remember what file folder it was stored in, what website it was on, or scroll through hundreds of emails trying to find it. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>Now with Recall, you can access virtually what you have seen or done on your PC in a way that feels like having photographic memory. Copilot+ PCs organize information like we do – based on relationships and associations unique to each of our individual experiences. This helps you remember things you may have forgotten so you can find what you’re looking for quickly and intuitively by simply using the cues you remember. <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>

<p><iframe title="YouTube Video" aria-labelledby="ariaLabel_664c024649637&#34;" title="Recall instantly with Recall on Copilot+ PC" width="100%" height="746" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/maC9iZMaAlM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div>
<p>You can scroll across time to find the content you need in your timeline across any application, website, document, or more. Interact intuitively using snapshots with screenray to help you take the next step using suggested actions based on object recognition. And get back to where you were, whether to a specific email in Outlook or the right chat in Teams.</p>
<p>Recall leverages your personal semantic index, built and stored entirely on your device. Your snapshots are yours; they stay locally on your PC. You can delete individual snapshots, adjust and delete ranges of time in Settings, or pause at any point right from the icon in the System Tray on your Taskbar. You can also filter apps and websites from ever being saved. You are always in control with privacy you can trust.</p>
<h3><strong>Cocreate with AI-powered image creation and editing, built into Windows</strong></h3>
<p>Since the launch of Image Creator, almost 10 billion images have been generated, helping more people bring their ideas to life easily by using natural language to describe what they want to create. Yet, today’s cloud offerings may limit the number of images you can create, keep you waiting while the artwork processes or even present privacy concerns. By using the Neural Processing Units (NPUs) and powerful local small language models, we are bringing innovative new experiences to your favorite creative applications like Paint and Photos.</p>
<div>
<p id="ariaLabel_664c024649680">YouTube Video</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube Video" aria-labelledby="ariaLabel_664c024649680&#34;" title="Turn ideas into art with Cocreator on Copilot+ PC" width="100%" height="746" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dEd3YbCeXYk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div>
<p>Combine your ink strokes with text prompts to generate new images in nearly real time with Cocreator. As you iterate, so does the artwork, helping you more easily refine, edit and evolve your ideas. Powerful diffusion-based algorithms optimize for the highest quality output over minimum steps to make it feel like you are creating alongside AI. Use the creativity slider to choose from a range of artwork from more literal to more expressive. Once you select your artwork, you can continue iterating on top of it, helping you express your ideas, regardless of your creative skills.</p>
