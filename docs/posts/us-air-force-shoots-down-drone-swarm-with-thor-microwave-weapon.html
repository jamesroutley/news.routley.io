    <h1>US Air Force shoots down drone swarm with THOR microwave weapon</h1>

			<p><span>The US Air Force’s Tactical High-Power Operational Responder (THOR) microwave weapon has neutralized a swarm of drones in a </span><a href="https://www.afrl.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3396995/afrl-conducts-swarm-technology-demonstration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>recent trial</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Conducted at the Chestnut Test Site in New Mexico, the activity simulated a real-world swarm attack on military assets.</span></p>
<p><span>THOR engaged the targets and knocked them out of the sky using its non-kinetic, speed-of-light microwave pulses.</span></p>
<p><span>According to THOR program manager </span><b>Adrian Lucero</b><span>, the weapon proved effective in neutralizing multiple targets even though it had never before been tested against the types of drones used in the trial.</span></p>
<p><span>“THOR was exceptionally effective at disabling the swarm with its wide beam, high peak powers, and fast-moving gimbal to track and disable the targets,” he explained.</span></p>
<h2><span>Addressing Drone Threats</span></h2>
<p><span>As drone threats become increasingly sophisticated, many countries have invested billions in bolstering their counter-drone capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span>The US, for example, has been exploring different technologies to protect against such threats.</span></p>
<p><span>Investments in directed energy to counter drone swarms have also increased to provide better and more effective protection to US military personnel anywhere in the world.</span></p>
<p><span>Apart from the THOR weapon system, the US </span><a href="https://www.thedefensepost.com/2023/01/24/epirus-counter-drone-microwave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>plans to deploy the Leonidas high-power microwave weapon</span></a><span> that neutralizes drones by zapping their electronics.</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, BlueHalo received a $46-million contract last month for the production of a </span><a href="https://www.thedefensepost.com/2023/04/12/us-army-laser-weapon-squad-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>20-kilowatt anti-drone high-energy laser</span></a><span> to be mounted on infantry squad vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span>“[The Air Force Research Laboratory] is committed to developing such advanced technologies to defend our service members on the front lines,” AFRL high power electromagnetics division chief </span><b>Ken Miller</b><span> stressed.</span></p>
