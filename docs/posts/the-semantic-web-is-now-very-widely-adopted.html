    <h1>The semantic web is now very widely adopted</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <!-- Being on The Semantic Web is easy, and, frankly, well worth the bother -->
<p>The Semantic Web is the <em>old</em> Web 3.0.  Before &#34;Web 3.0&#34; meant
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">crypto-whatnot</a>, it meant
&#34;machine-readable websites&#34;.</p>
<p>I thought this concept hadn&#39;t really gone anywhere but it turns out that The
Semantic Web (best read in a very deep voice) is now very widely adopted.</p>
<p>The Semantic Web is so widely adopted in fact that I think it&#39;s fair to say
that we&#39;re already on Web 3.0.  It&#39;s not the future, it&#39;s the present.  I
suppose that means the blockchain crowd will need to argue their case to get
all that crypto stuff into the next major version.  Good luck to them,
<a href="https://calpaterson.com/blockchain.html">really</a>.</p>
<p>If Web 3.0 is already here, where is it, then?  Mostly, it&#39;s hidden in the
markup.</p>
<h2>JSON-LD for a <code>BlogPosting</code></h2>
<p>A worked example might help.  Here&#39;s how Semantic Web metadata is added for a
blog post, for example the one you&#39;re reading now.</p>
<p>You include a special <code>&lt;script type=&#34;application/ld+json&#34;&gt;</code> element inside the
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of an HTML page.  Inside that element is some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD">JSON-LD</a>.</p>
<p>JSON-LD (JSON &#34;for Linked Data&#34;) is the leading format for encoding Sematic Web
metadata.  It&#39;s <em>just JSON</em>, really.  There are schemas that lay out the
&#34;types&#34; you can use to describe the stuff on your page.  For a blog post, the
right type is <a href="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">BlogPosting</a>.  Here&#39;s a (mildly
truncated) example of a <code>BlogPosting</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>&#34;@context&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;https://schema.org&#34;</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>&#34;@type&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;BlogPosting&#34;</span><span>,</span><span></span>

</pre></div>
<p>It&#39;s all pretty self expanatory:</p>
<ul>
<li>
keys starting with <code>@</code> are metadata (meta-metadata?)<ul>
<li><code>@context</code> is the namespace.  Usually it&#39;s schema.org</li>
<li><code>@type</code> is the class, <code>BlogPosting</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the other keys are just things <a href="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">allowed in the <code>BlogPosting</code> type</a></li>
<li>the values of keys can be other types, eg <code>Person</code> for the <code>author</code> key in
this case</li>
</ul>
<h2>What&#39;s in it for me?</h2>
<p>Does anyone actually read all that stuff?  Yes, a lot of bots are out there
parsing JSON-LD metadata.  Nice things tend to happen to blog posts that
include the Semantic Web metadata:</p>
<p>Social media sites (Twitter/Discord/Facebook/WhatsApp/etc) start showing that
<strong>nice link preview</strong> with an image for your links.  Link previews usually look
a bit like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://fosstodon.org/@calpaterson/112953513297517114">
<img alt="screenshot of a mastodon link preview" src="https://csvbase.com/blog-static/mastodon-link-preview.png"/>
</a></p><p>People do click on these link previews more often than on &#34;bare urls&#34;, which is
something that drives adoption of the Semantic Web.</p>
<p>Search engine web crawlers also make use of this metadata both to <strong>crawl a bit
more intelligently</strong> but also to show <strong>more information in search results</strong>
(for example: who the author is).  Again, people are more likely to click on
such &#34;enhanced&#34; search results, which is another thing that has driven
adoption.</p>
<p>Automated link aggregators <strong>show your post</strong> to their users.  I once woke to
many many nice emails from people who normally wouldn&#39;t have read my blog.
After being initially puzzled I eventually learned that Android had decided,
all on its own, to show my blog post on its on-phone news screen.  All possible
because of Semantic Web metadata.</p>
<p>Many other, usually nice, things can happen.  The joy of The Semantic Web is
that it is <em>permissionless</em> as well as &#34;vendor-neutral&#34;.  Anyone can take the
metadata and run with it.  That&#39;s cool, that&#39;s the web spirit.</p>
<h2>Is it really hard?</h2>
<p>Not really, no.  A bit of JSON, containing things already on the page anyway,
just laid out in a way for computers to read.  If people can write <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/reckoning/">enormous
frontend apps</a> I think they can
figure out JSON-LD.</p>
<h2>JSON-LD for other stuff</h2>
<p>There are other JSON-LD &#34;types&#34; than just <code>BlogPosting</code>.  A lot more.  Some
well supported ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/Event"><code>Event</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/LocalBusiness"><code>LocalBusiness</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/JobPosting"><code>JobPosting</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/Product"><code>Product</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/Recipe"><code>Recipe</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://csvbase.com/about">csvbase</a> is a website full of table data
(tinder-for-dogs style pitch: &#34;Github, for data tables&#34;), so it uses the
<a href="https://schema.org/Dataset"><code>Dataset</code></a> type to describe each of tables
(<a href="https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges">for example</a>) in a
machine-readable way.  Here&#39;s an example of the JSON-LD csvbase includes on
each table page:</p>

</pre></div>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of stuff in there.  From basic things like the last time the
data was changed (personal bugbear of mine) to some more complicated stuff.</p>
<p>Several <code>DataDownload</code> objects are included, to help bots understand where
people can go to just download the data, without having the visit the site.
Hopefully that&#39;s nice for people viewing tables through data-specific search
engines, like Google&#39;s <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/">Dataset
Search</a>.  Save them a click.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also some more advanced stuff.  The JSON-LD document actually includes
<em>two</em> schemas.  One is the ordinary &#34;schema.org&#34; one (<code>Dataset</code>) but the other
is a schema called <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/">&#34;CSV on the
Web&#34;</a>, which allows you to describe
the columns and the types of those columns --- as well as other more detailed
data I haven&#39;t sorted out yet.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t direct evidence that anyone is yet doing much with these CSVW types
yet but Google do <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/dataset#tabular">document that they read
it</a>
so perhaps there is more to come on this in the future from them.  And of
course, there is nothing to stop anyone else using it.  It&#39;s all standardised
stuff.</p>
<h2>It is really necessary?  &#34;Doesn&#39;t AI solve this?&#34;</h2>
<p>It would of course be possible to sic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT">Chatty-Jeeps</a> on the raw markup and
have it extract all of this stuff automatically.  But there are some good
reasons why not.</p>
<p>The first is that large language models (LLMs) routinely get stuff wrong.
If you want bots to get it right, provide the metadata to ensure that they do.</p>
<p>The second is that requiring an LLM to read the web is throughly
disproportionate and exclusionary.  Everyone parsing the web would need to be
paying for pricy GPU time to parse out the meaning of the web.  It would feel
bizarre if &#34;technological progress&#34; meant that fat GPUs were required for
computers to read web pages.</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>JSON-LD is not the only form of Semantic Web metadata, though it&#39;s increasingly
got the most momentum.  There is some overlap between the various schemes and
many bots will parse whatever they can find.  Here&#39;s a quick overview of the
alternatives:</p>
<p>At some point Facebook created the <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph Protocol</a>, a
standard based on using special <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags.  It&#39;s widely used and supported
but only covers the kinds of things you might post to Facebook: articles,
songs, videos, etc.  What zoomers call &#34;Content&#34;.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)">&#34;microdata&#34;</a>.
It&#39;s very simple but I think quite hard to parse out.  Bits of it are well
supported.</p>
<p>Twitter published a spec for <a href="https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/abouts-cards">&#34;Twitter
Cards&#34;</a>
which pretty much just lets you describe how you want your thing to appear on
Twitter.  It&#39;s pretty limited - but Twitter is popular - so this is widely
implemented.</p>
<p>Before JSON-LD there was a nest of other, more XMLy, standards emitted by the
various web steering groups.  These actually have very, very deep support in
many places (for example in library and archival systems) but on the open web
they are not a goer.</p>
<h2>Boring technology</h2>
<p>It is surprising how low-key The Semantic Web is.  Thousands of sites are
already setting this metadata.  The Semantic Web is already widespread, it&#39;s
just that there was no moment of victory.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Googlers, if you&#39;re reading this, JSON-LD could have the same level of public
awareness as RSS if only you could release, and then shut down, some kind of
app or service in this area.  Please, for the good of the web: consider it.</p>
<p>Semantic Web information on websites is a bit of a &#34;living document&#34;.  You tend
publish something, then have a look to see what people have parsed (or failed
to parse) it and then you try to improve it a bit.  If you have ideas for ways
that csvbase can improve its metadata, please <a href="https://github.com/calpaterson/csvbase/issues">open an issue on the github
repo</a>.</p>
