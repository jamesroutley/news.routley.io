    <h1>Moving our Encrypted DNS servers to run in RAM</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div> <p><time datetime="2023-11-10T09:03:20.562804Z">November 10, 2023</time> <a href="http://tinylogger.com/en/blog/tag/system-transparency">System Transparency</a>Â </p>  <p>We recently <a href="https://mullvad.net/blog/2023/9/20/we-have-successfully-completed-our-migration-to-ram-only-vpn-infrastructure/">announced the completion</a> of our migration to remove all traces of disks in use on our VPN infrastructure.</p>

<p>Today we can announce more steps forward - our Encrypted DNS service has also been converted to run from RAM!</p>

<h2>Encrypted DNS for all - paying customers or not</h2>

<p>Encrypted DNS (also known as DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS) protects your DNS queries from being snooped on by third parties when <strong>not</strong> connected to our VPN service. DNS queries are encrypted between your device and our DNS servers.</p>

<p>Primarily as a service to be used when not connected to our VPN servers, this service is completely cost-free, and available to anyone that wishes to have a trustworthy, audited Encrypted DNS service with <a href="http://github.com/mullvad/dns-blocklists">optional content blocking</a>. This service is available from servers located worldwide, and can be configured by using the <a href="https://mullvad.net/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls/">following guide</a> on our website.</p>

<p>This service can be used in conjunction with our VPN service, but is discouraged, as it will always be slower than using the DNS resolver on the VPN server that you are connected to.</p>

<p>All of these Encrypted DNS servers are configured using the same Linux kernel, with the same level of security and privacy as the as our VPN infrastructure. This is the next step towards running our stateless infrastructure from RAM.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></section></div></div>
