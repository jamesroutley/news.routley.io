Guardian Australia has not been able to contact Xu for comment.</p><p>A man named Steven Reece Lewis was introduced as the chief executive officer of HyperVerse at an online global launch event in December 2021, with video messages of support from a clutch of celebrities released on Twitter the following month, including from the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/chuck-norris" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Chuck Norris</a>.</p><p>Promotional material released for HyperVerse, which was linked to a previous scheme called HyperFund, said Reece Lewis was a graduate of the University of Leeds and held a master’s degree from the University of Cambridge. A brief career summary of Reece Lewis, which was presented in a video launch for potential investors, said he had worked for Goldman Sachs, sold a web development company to Adobe and launched an IT start-up firm, before being recruited to head up HyperVerse by the HyperTech group. This was the umbrella organisation for a range of Hyper-branded crypto schemes.</p><p>Lee spoke at the launch event as “chairman” of the HyperTech group, while Xu was introduced as the group’s “founder”.</p><p>The company praised Reece Lewis’s “strong performance and drive”, citing his credentials as the reason for his recruitment.</p><figure id="d01812d6-af6a-4857-a23e-34831b400248"
