    <h1>Chrome intends to remove XSLT from the HTML spec</h1>

          <p dir="auto">First, my apologies for commenting here; <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3285251497" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/whatwg/html/issues/11523/hovercard" href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523">#11523</a> was (rightfully) locked while I was in the middle of composing this comment, but I didn&#39;t see any of these points mentioned elsewhere in that thread, so I&#39;m adding it here.</p>
<hr/>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Do any of your usage statistics show the age and “size” (popularity) of pages that use XSLT?</p>
<p dir="auto">Because if XSLT is mainly used by large commercial sites that are frequently updated, then deprecating the builtin support seems reasonable, since most of the sites will quickly update to include a polyfill. But if XSLT is mainly used by small personal sites that were last updated decades ago, then I wouldn&#39;t expect many of these sites to (ever) update, meaning that removing XSLT support would just mean that these sites will be broken forever.</p>
<p dir="auto">Given that XSLT has been supported since 1999 and its usage has been trending downwards, I suspect that the affected sites will mainly fall into the second category, meaning that the most likely outcome is site breakage rather than sites updating to use a polyfill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Well-built web pages use progressive enhancement, so even if any particular JavaScript/CSS feature is broken/removed, the page should still continue to partially work. So if JavaScript support for <code>XSLTProcessor()</code> is removed, then at the worst, all the JavaScript on a page will be broken, but the rest of the page should still be usable.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, removing support for <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet … ?&gt;</code> seems particularly problematic, because if that is no longer supported, then users will simply see raw, unformatted XML, which makes the page completely unusable for non-technical users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Previous web platform deprecations have mainly affected JavaScript, and occasionally (or maybe never, I can&#39;t find any examples) CSS. Many legacy HTML features have been deprecated, but as far as I&#39;m aware, all of them still work with all modern browsers. Some random examples:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_font" rel="nofollow"><code>&lt;font&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_th_align" rel="nofollow"><code>align=</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_xmp" rel="nofollow"><code>&lt;xmp&gt;</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">So while previous removals may have broken complex/interactive web apps, or may have caused minor format/layout changes, nothing has outright removed features used by pure “documents” (as in things that you could print on paper). However, many traditional documents use <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet … ?&gt;</code>, so its removal seems unprecedented. But I may be completely wrong here, so please feel free to correct me.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">Personal note: I maintain a site that uses <code>XSLTProcessor()</code> interactively and that separately uses <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet … ?&gt;</code> for RSS feeds; it would be slightly annoying if I had to add a polyfill, but I&#39;d have no problem updating it before any browser changes are introduced, so no users will ever experience any breakage.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, my main concern is for the “long tail” of the web—there&#39;s lots of vital information only available on random university/personal websites last updated before 2005, or are only available on the <a href="https://archive.org/" rel="nofollow">Internet Archive</a>. Many of these sites use <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet … ?&gt;</code> (and other obsolete features not discussed here like <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;font&gt;</code>), and it would be a real shame if these sites stopped working.</p>
