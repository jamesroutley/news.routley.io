    <h1>Nuclear energy is more expensive than renewables, report finds</h1>

to bring them into line with the experience of that US project.</p><p>&#34;The cancellation of this project is significant because it was the only SMR project in the US that had received design certification from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is an essential step before construction can commence,&#34; the report notes.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">The &#39;integration costs&#39; of renewables</h2><p>This year&#39;s draft GenCost report also provides more data on the estimated &#34;integration costs&#34; for variable renewable technologies.</p><p>It says most new-build technologies, like renewables, can enter an electricity system and provide reliable power by relying on existing capacity already deployed, but as their share increases, which forces the retirement of existing flexible capacity, the system will find it increasingly difficult to provide reliable power supply without additional investment.</p><p>To address that issue, the report calculates the additional cost of making variable renewables reliable at shares of 60, 70, 80, and 90 per cent of the system (the extra &#34;integration costs&#34; consist mainly of new storage and transmission costs).</p><p>The report found even when those integration costs were taken into account, the cost range for variable renewables was still the lowest of all new-build technologies in 2023 and 2030.</p><p>The graph below highlights the results for those different scenarios 2023.</p><figure role="group" data-component="VerticalArticleFigure" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/103255940"><img alt="Variable costs for renewables scenarios" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 543px," srcset=", https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/61b63d78b6a78bfcf9ae7069386023b1?src" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/61b63d78b6a78bfcf9ae7069386023b1?src" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"/></figure><p>Mr Graham says if we didn&#39;t want to reduce emissions the cost of new coal and gas plants would only be slightly higher than the cost of building renewables.</p><p>However, since we have a net zero emission goal in Australia, &#34;we might as well build renewables because that actually comes with emission reductions, whereas new coal and gas will lead to higher emissions,&#34; he told RN Breakfast.</p><p>&#34;Mind you, the <a href="https://aemo.com.au/consultations/current-and-closed-consultations/draft-2024-isp-consultation" data-component="ContentLink" data-uri="coremedia://externallink/103255956">integrated system plan</a> was released last week and it did emphasise that although it is likely to be a renewable future, we&#39;ll still need gas as a supporting technology.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a good technology for filling in the gaps around renewables, as well as storage and other methods for making sure that power&#39;s still reliable,&#34; he said.</p></div></div></div>
