<p>Harrison.rad.1 excels in the same radiology exams taken by human radiologists, as well as in benchmarks against other foundational models.</p>
<p>The Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) 2B Rapids exam is considered one of the leading and toughest certifications for radiologists. Only 40-59% of human radiologists pass on their first attempt. Radiologists who re-attempt the exam within a year of passing score an average of 50.88 out of 60 (84.8%)*.</p>
<p>Harrison.rad.1 scored 51.4 out of 60 (85.67%). Other competing models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Microsoft’s LLaVA-Med, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, mostly scored below 30**, which is statistically no better than random guessing.</p>

<p>General purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but their broad, generic focus renders them less suited to critical applications where accuracy is of paramount importance. A highly specialised and nuanced function like healthcare requires a specialised model. This is why Harrison.rad.1 was born.</p>
