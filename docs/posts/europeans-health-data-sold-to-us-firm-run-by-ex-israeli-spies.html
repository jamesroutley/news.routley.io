    <p>When the American data security company Kiteworks bought out its Dutch industry peer Zivver in June, CEO Jonathan Yaron described it as “a proud moment for all of us”. </p><p>The purchase was “a significant milestone in Kiteworks’ continued mission to safeguard sensitive data across all communication channels”, he added in a<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341117669204480003?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7341117669204480003%2C7341129731636924418%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287341129731636924418%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7341117669204480003%29"> LinkedIn post</a>. </p><p>But what Yaron did not mention was that this acquisition – coming at a politically charged moment between the U.S. and the EU – put highly sensitive, personal data belonging to European and British citizens directly into American hands. </p><p>Zivver is used by institutions including hospitals, health insurers, government services and immigration authorities in countries including the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and the U.K.</p><p>Neither did Yaron mention that much of Kiteworks’ top management – himself included – are former members of an elite Israeli Defence Force unit that specialised in eavesdropping and breaking encrypted communications. </p>

    <p>In addition to this, an investigation by Follow the Money shows that data processed by Zivver is less secure than the service leads its customers to believe. Research found that emails and documents sent by Zivver can be read by the company itself. This was later confirmed by Zivver to Follow the Money.</p><blockquote><p>“All of the red flags should have been raised during this acquisition”</p></blockquote><p>Zivver maintained, however, that it does not have access to the encryption keys used by customers, and therefore cannot hand over data to U.S. authorities. </p><p>This is despite independent researchers confirming that the data was – for a brief period – accessible to the company. If U.S. officials wanted access to such communication, Zivver would be legally obligated to provide it.</p><p>Cybersecurity experts now point to serious security concerns, and ask why this sale seems to have gone through without scrutiny from European authorities.</p><p>“All of the red flags should have been raised during this acquisition,” said intelligence expert Hugo Vijver, a former long-term officer in AIVD, the Dutch security service.</p><h2><strong>Classified documents </strong></h2><p>Amsterdam-based Zivver – which was founded in 2015 by Wouter Klinkhamer and Rick Goud – provides systems for the encrypted exchange of information via email, chat and video, among other means. </p><p>Dutch courts, for example, work with Zivver to send classified documents, and solicitors use the service to send confidential information to the courts. </p><p>Other government agencies in the Netherlands – including <abbr data-type="explanation" data-explanation-uri-encoded="%3Cp%3EIt%20is%20also%20used%20by%20the%20Employee%20Insurance%20Agency%20(UWV)%2C%20the%20Immigration%20and%20Naturalisation%20Service%20(IND)%2C%20the%20Health%20and%20Youth%20Care%20Inspectorate%20(IGJ)%2C%20the%20Public%20Prosecution%20Service%20(OM)%20and%20dozens%20of%20municipalities%20and%20provinces.%3C%2Fp%3E">the immigration service –</abbr> also use Zivver.

    <p>In Europe, Hubert said: “We communicate almost exclusively via American platforms. And that means that the U.S. can read our communications and disrupt our entire society if they decide that they no longer like us.”</p><p>Zivver had offered an alternative – a European platform governed by EU law. </p><p>“We are now throwing that away. If you want to share something confidential with a court or government, consider using a typewriter. That&#39;s about all we have left,” Hubert said.</p><h2><strong>Israeli ties</strong></h2><p>Beyond American jurisdiction, Kiteworks’ management raises another layer of concern: its links to Israeli intelligence.</p><p>Several of the company’s top executives, including CEO Yaron, are veterans of Unit 8200, the elite cyber unit of the Israel Defence Force (IDF). The unit is renowned for its code-breaking abilities and feared for its surveillance operations.</p>

A company like Zivver fits perfectly into that strategy.”</p><p>The information handled by Zivver – confidential communications between governments, hospitals and citizens – is a potential goldmine for intelligence services.</p><p>According to intelligence expert Vijver, access to this kind of material makes it easier to pressure individuals into cooperating with intelligence agencies. Once an intelligence service has access to medical, financial and personal data, it can more easily pressure people into spying for it, he said.</p><p>But the gain for intelligence services lies not just in sensitive information, said Hubert: “Any data that allows an agency to tie telephone numbers, addresses or payment data to an individual is of great interest to them.” </p><p>He added: “It is exactly this type of data that is abundantly present in communications between civilians, governments and care institutions. In other words, the information that flows through a company like Zivver is extremely valuable for intelligence services.”</p><h2><strong>A flawed security model?</strong></h2><p>These geopolitical concerns become more pronounced when combined with technical worries about Zivver’s encryption. </p><p>For years, Zivver presented itself as a European alternative that guaranteed privacy. Its marketing materials claimed that messages were encrypted on the sender’s device and that the company had “zero access” to content. </p><p>But an investigation by two cybersecurity experts at a Dutch government agency, at the request of Follow the Money, undermines this claim. </p>

    <p>The experts, who participated in the investigation on condition of anonymity, explored what happened when that government agency logged into Zivver’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://app.zivver.com/">web application</a> to send information.</p><p>Tests showed that when government users sent messages through Zivver’s web application, the content – including attachments – was uploaded to Zivver’s servers as readable text before being encrypted. The same process applied to email addresses of senders and recipients.</p><p>“In these specific cases, Zivver processed the messages in readable form,” said independent cybersecurity researcher Matthijs Koot, who verified the findings. </p><p>“Even if only briefly, technically speaking it is possible that Zivver was able to view these messages,” he said.</p><p>He added: “Whether a message is encrypted at a later stage makes little difference. It may help against hackers, but it no longer matters in terms of protection against Zivver.”</p><p>Despite these findings, Zivver continues to insist on its website and in promotional material elsewhere – <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.applytosupply.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/915565226532238">including</a> on the U.K. government’s Digital Marketplace – that “contents of secure messages are inaccessible to Zivver and third parties”.</p><p>So far, no evidence has surfaced that Zivver misused its technical access. But now that the company is owned by Kiteworks, experts see a heightened risk.</p><p>Former intelligence officer Vijver puts it bluntly: “Given the links between Zivver, Kiteworks and Unit 8200, I believe there is zero chance that no data is going to Israel. To think otherwise is completely naive.”</p><h2>A missed safeguard</h2><p>The sale of Zivver could technically have been blocked or investigated under Dutch law. According to the Security Assessment of Investments, Mergers and Acquisitions Act, such sensitive takeovers are supposed to be reviewed by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bureautoetsinginvesteringen.nl/">a specialised agency. </a></p><p>But the Dutch interior ministry declared that Zivver was not part of the country’s “critical infrastructure,” meaning that no review was carried out.</p><p>That, in Hubert’s view, was “a huge blunder”. </p>

    <p>“It’s bad enough that a company that plays such an important role in government communications is falling into American hands, but the fact that there are all kinds of Israeli spies there is very serious,” he said.</p><blockquote><p>“The takeover is taking place in an unsafe world full of geopolitical tensions”</p></blockquote><p>Experts say the Zivver case highlights Europe’s lack of strategic control over its digital infrastructure.</p><p>Mariëtte van Huijstee of the Netherlands-based <abbr data-type="explanation" data-explanation-uri-encoded="%3Cp%3EThis%20is%20an%20%3Ca%20target%3D%22_blank%22%20rel%3D%22noopener%20noreferrer%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rathenau.nl%2Fen%2Fabout-us%22%3Eindependent%20research%20institute%3C%2Fa%3E%20based%20in%20The%20Hague.%3C%2Fp%3E">Rathenau Institute</abbr> said: “I doubt whether the security of sensitive emails and files … should be left to the private sector. And if you think that is acceptable, should we leave it to non-European parties over whom we have no control?”</p><p>“We need to think much more strategically about our digital infrastructure and regulate these kinds of issues much better, for example by designating encryption services as vital infrastructure,” she added.</p><p>Zivver, for its part, claimed that security will improve under Kiteworks. Zivver’s full responses to Follow the Money’s questions can be read <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26180757-20250901-reactie-zivver-op-eerste-set-vragen-follow-the-money/">here</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26089259-answers-zivver-to-follow-up-questions-from-follow-the-money/">here</a>.</p><p>But Van Huijstee was not convinced.</p><p>“Kiteworks employs people who come from a service that specialises in decrypting files,” she said. </p><p>“The takeover is taking place in an unsafe world full of geopolitical tensions, and we are dealing with data that is very valuable. In such a case, trust is not enough and more control is needed.”</p>
