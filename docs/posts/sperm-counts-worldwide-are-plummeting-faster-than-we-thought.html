    <h1>Sperm counts worldwide are plummeting faster than we thought</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><article><section><div><p>Five years ago, a study describing a precipitous decline in sperm counts sparked extreme concerns that humanity was on the path to extinction. Now a new study shows that sperm counts have fallen further and the rate of decline is speeding up, raising fears of a looming global fertility crisis.</p><p><a href="http://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmx022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The initial study</a>, published in July 2017, revealed that sperm counts—the number of sperm in a single ejaculate—plummeted by more than 50 percent among men in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand between 1973 and 2011. Since then, a team led by the same researchers has explored what has happened in the last 10 years.<i> </i>In a new meta-analysis, which appears today <a href="https://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/humrep/document/dmac035+corrected?node=d78a00a5de055762e341&amp;version=1942031:1032dc11f591de977eed&amp;preview=true" target="_blank">in the journal</a> <i>Human Reproduction Update</i>, researchers analyzed studies of semen samples published between 2014 and 2019 and added this to their previous data. The newer studies have a more global perspective and involved semen samples from 14,233 men, including some from South and Central America, Africa, and Asia. The upshot: Not only has the decline in total sperm counts continued—reaching a drop of 62 percent—but the decline per year has doubled since 2000.</p><p>The 2017 report<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6455044/" target="_blank"></a> also revealed that sperm concentration (the number of sperm per milliliter of semen) dropped by an average of 1.6 percent <i>per year</i>, totaling more than a 52 percent among men in these regions over the previous four decades.</p></div></section></article></section><section></section></div></div>
