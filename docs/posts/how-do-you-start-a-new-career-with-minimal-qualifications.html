    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>This week will be my 16th Thanksgiving in a row working. I haven&#39;t had a cost-of-living increase since 2008, the annual merit increases cap out right around inflation (or under) most years, I&#39;ve been working 60~ hour weeks, working 6 day weeks, for over half a year now. In the past 2 weeks we&#39;ve had 3 people quit from just my team. Put a fork in me, I&#39;m done.<p>The problem is, my job doesn&#39;t really translate to much. I fill out paperwork all day, clearing international freight through customs. I don&#39;t have a GED, I&#39;m still 3~ years out from earning a degree (which I don&#39;t actually want, but employers 100% do). I&#39;ve even been rejected by companies in my industry, Flexport for example rejected me outright for not having a degree at a time when I had 11 years of experience &#34;Hope all is well, Ryan! I wanted to extend a virtual wave and thank you for your interest in joining our team. You obviously have many of the skills we&#39;re looking for. However, for the Customs Brokerage role we require a BA/BS degree as well as previous experience in a broker role doing entries and customs classifications.&#34; so I struggle to even escape my current employer for a job that pays even remotely what I make (about 39k in central Indiana after 15 and a half years, while McDonalds is starting at $13-15 an hour all over the state...).</p><p>I&#39;m at the point where the only joy I have in my life is what little time my wife and I get to spend together, and some volunteer stuff through my religion. Today I&#39;ll clock in, work 11 hours, get to have dinner with my wife and do some classwork, then back to bed to rinse and repeat. On Thanksgiving I&#39;ll only work 10 hours...</p><p>What do I do? I can&#39;t get a degree any faster than I already am.</p></td></div></div>
