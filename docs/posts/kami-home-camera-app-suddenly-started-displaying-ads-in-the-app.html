        <p>Are you kidding me with these ADS in Kami Home and Yi Home app (Android). Seriously, what is this? Everytime I open app there come some arabic tiktok ads. Google Play does not even tell that there is some ads. Is there a way to get these away without purchase cloud subscription?</p>

        <p>Noticed the same. I don’t want a subscription, because I use sd cards… Please give us an option to remove the ads without subscription.</p>

          <p>To Yi Home and Kami Home developers, bosses and shareholders,</p>
<p>I really hope you guys consider removing your advertisements for users who don’t use your subscription. It really is not safe having advertisements in cctv softwares which is suppose to provide immediate response when we wanna access the application for emergencies.etc</p>
<p>Furthermore, isn’t it enough making money from selling your physical products? You wanna be even greedier with subscriptions and on top of that, advertisements now? Come on guys! get your act together. It defeats the purpose of trying to provide “safety” for the people.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>That’s completely unacceptable! I have an active subscription plan, and added my wife’s account to see the same cameras.</p>
<p>No way. If this happens, I’ll certainly switch all those cameras and throw them into trash can!</p>

          <p>Same canned answer every time this concern about ads is raised.</p>
<p>This goes without saying that Yi Technology does not listen or care about customer complaints.</p>
<p>The cloud subscription does not work on all customer’s use-case.</p>
<p>In our end, we are using a prepaid internet wifi. That means our internet usage is limited. If we subscribe to yi cloud, our allocated and limited internet data will be gone in just a few hours because the camera will use up all our data (uploading).</p>
