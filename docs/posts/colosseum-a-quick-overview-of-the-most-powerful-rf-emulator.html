<p>Originally created by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for a unique project called the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/spectrum-collaboration-challenge" target="_blank">Spectrum Collaboration Challenge</a> (SC2), Colosseum is the world’s largest RF emulator. SC2 ran from roughly 2014-2019 where teams faced off to create robust modems and artificial intelligence algorithms that could maintain a link in a hostile or highly contested environment. The winner of the event took home 2 million dollars.</p>
<p>The event was interesting, but the centerpiece of it all, Colosseum, is even more interesting. To quote its <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/colosseum/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/colosseum_brochure.pdf" target="_blank">brochure</a>, its current specs are boggling:</p>
<ul>
<li>256 Software Defined Radios USRPs X310</li>
<li>900 TB of Network Attached Storage (NAS)</li>
<li>171 high-performance servers</li>
<li>19 clock distribution systems</li>
<li>Software-based traffic generation solutions</li>
<li>hosted on a pool of dedicated servers</li>
<li>Full-mesh networking capability</li>
</ul>
<p>During operation the testbed can pull some <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-forklift-ballet-how-darpa-trucked-its-massive-radiofrequency-testbed-across-the-united-states" target="_blank">insane figures:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>3 Peta-Ops per second of computing power</li>
<li>52 terabytes per second of data to emulate 65,000 channel operations between 256 wireless devices.</li>
<li>It can draw up to 92 kilowatts of power and requires 200 gallons of water per minute to cycle through its cooling system to keep it from overheating.</li>
</ul>
<p>and if you want to get a scale of its size you can see it being moved into Northeastern University in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob-E0F8AoRA&amp;ab_channel=InstitutefortheWirelessInternetofThings" target="_blank">this video</a>. A <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-forklift-ballet-how-darpa-trucked-its-massive-radiofrequency-testbed-across-the-united-states" target="_blank">previously linked article above</a> also recounts the somewhat interesting tale of moving the machine during the SC2 event.</p>
