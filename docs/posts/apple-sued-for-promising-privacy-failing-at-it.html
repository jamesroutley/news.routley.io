    <h1>Apple sued for promising privacy, failing at it</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Apple has again been sued for promising privacy and allegedly failing to provide it.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/01/28/pacer_apple_lawsuit.pdf">complaint</a> [PDF], filed in Northern California District Court on behalf of plaintiff Julie Cima, claims Apple captures iPhone customer data despite device settings declaring a preference that information should not be shared.</p>
<p>&#34;Apple records consumers’ personal information and activity on its consumer mobile devices and applications (&#39;apps&#39;), even after consumers explicitly indicate through Apple’s mobile device settings that they do not want their data and information shared,&#34; the complaint, filed this week, says. &#34;This activity amounts to an enormous wealth of data that Apple collects and uses for its financial gain.&#34;</p>

    

<p>The legal filing cites research published last November by a two-person firm developer team called Mysk that <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/mysk_co/status/1588308341780262912">claimed</a> Apple collects analytics data even when iPhone users have set a preference disallowing data collection. Those claims led to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/14/apple_data_collection_lawsuit/">a similar sueball</a> shortly after they appeared, and to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/10/apple_wiretap_lawsuit/">another such case</a> filed earlier this month.</p>

</ul>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/08/apple_ios_privacy/">Prior research</a> by boffins from Oxford University, published in April 2022, presents similar allegations. The researchers claim Apple engages in invasive data practices similar to those it forbids among third-parties, in violation of consumer expectation and marketing slogans.</p>
<p>As with the previous privacy lawsuits, Cima&#39;s lawsuit argues that Apple makes misleading promises in its marketing and published policies.</p>

        


        

<p>The perceived mismatch between marketing and reality is a common theme in litigation against Apple. Those raising legal challenges in the past, for example, have railed about the discrepancy between <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/12/15/apple_iphone_lawsuit/">advertised screen size and actual screen size</a>. They&#39;ve also taken issue with Apple&#39;s assertions about the extent to which its products <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/30/apple_italy_waterproof_fine/">can resist</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/26/apple_water_lawsuit/">water damage</a>.</p>
<p>This latest bit of lawyering goes after the alleged hypocrisy in Apple&#39;s privacy policy commitment, &#34;At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data,&#34; and in the company&#39;s promise to &#34;disable [the sharing of] Device Analytics altogether&#34; at the touch of an off button.</p>

        

<p>The complaint cites Apple billboard campaign slogans like &#34;Privacy. That’s iPhone,&#34; and &#34;What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone,&#34; and &#34;Your iPhone knows a lot about you. But we don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
<p>The lawsuit then goes on to insist that &#34;Apple does not honor users&#39; requests to restrict data sharing,&#34; claiming that the company tracks consumer actions including: how users find apps; the amount of time spent looking at apps in its App Store; App Store searches; and App Store ads displayed and clicked on.</p>
<p>Setting aside the possibility of legal deficiencies that can get such claims tossed, the iPhone maker may choose to defend itself by arguing that ingesting data through its first-party relationship with its customers is not sharing information with a third party.</p>

        

<p>Apple has not yet responded to the privacy claims made in the similar cases filed in November 11, 2022 (Libman v. Apple) [<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.classaction.org/media/libman-v-apple-inc.pdf">PDF</a>], and January, 2023 (Serrano v. Apple). In the former case, the company has agreed to file its response by February 17, 2023.</p>
<p>Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ®</p>
