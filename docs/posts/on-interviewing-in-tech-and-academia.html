  <section><p>I’ve recently switched careers from academia to software engineering. Some reflections on the interview and job market in these two different fields.</p>

<p>In my experience, every step in the interview process in academia is
adversarial. This both characterizes my own experience as an interviewee, and the interviews I gave as a
faculty member of at the University of Chicago. The first step in each meeting
is to get the interviewee to commit to something; the second step is to object
to it. This patterns holds from group interviews, to job talks, to one-on-one
meetings, and even to casual meals. Many one-on-one meetings begin with an
upfront claim that it will not be a discussion of work; they almost inevitably
evolve into a series of debates.</p>
<p>Although I recognize that there can always be exceptions, my experience in all
my interviews in software engineering was non-adversarial. Interviews rested
somewhere on a spectrum between the interviewee talking to a mostly silent
interviewer, to an active and healthy collaboration between interviewer and
interviewee. In no interview did it feel adversarial, or like the goal of the
interviewer was to put the interviewee on their most tenuous possible ground.
This was a welcome surprise given my previous experience in academia. I also do
think that it was nonetheless helpful to prepare for each interview under the
expectation that I might be put under maximal pressure.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Some of this experience may be specific to the academic job market
in philosophy.</p>

<p>In my opinion, most academic departments are basically the same. Cultures are
very similar, work-life balance is very similar, and management structure is
very similar. (Of course, the point here is that there is absolutely no
management whatsoever!) How do you pick between jobs? Compensation,
specialization of existing faculty members, and sometimes trying to avoid
particular known “bad apples”.</p>
<p>It quickly became clear that there are huge differences between tech companies,
and also within teams within the same company. These are differences in
culture, management style, team structure, etc. The standard question “Do you
have any questions for us?” is widely regarded as a joke in academic
interviews; in a tech it seems absolutely essential—and there are so many
questions to ask even after getting an offer.</p>
<p>I speculate that part of the difference here lies in the life-cycle of each
company. Academic departments are like very mature companies. I was mostly
interviewing at startups, which have a much greater diversity; things might
have felt more homogeneous if I was interviewing at bigger tech firms.</p>

<p>I am still pretty much baffled by the role of the recruiter. This obviously has
no equivalent in the academic interview process. My experience with recruiters
was that a key part of their job is to give you <em>x</em> hints, where <em>x</em> is a
function of something entirely obscure to me. Very
helpful to me as a candidate, but still a very odd (and seemingly potentially
very unfair) dynamic.</p>

<p>I am very excited to share that I’ll be taking the next step of my
career as a software engineer at <a href="https://clerk.com/">Clerk</a>. I couldn’t have
done this without the support of my family, friends, and peers at the
<a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>.</p>
