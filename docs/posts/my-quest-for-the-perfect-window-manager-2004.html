<p>

Welcome, gentle reader. Sit down, relax, and let me spin a tale for you. A
tale of joy, of sadness, of passion and betrayal, a tale of....Linux Window
Managers.

</p><p>

(Yes, &#34;over-dramatic&#34; is going to be my keynote here.)

</p><p>

My earliest introduction to the world of *nix Window Managers
was <a href="http://www.fvwm.org">Fvwm</a>.

</p><p>

Ah, Fvwm.

</p><p>

The horror. The clunkiness. The <i>ugliness</i>. Oh, how I hated it.

</p><p>

It began at university. If a workstation wasn&#39;t running its own commercial
desktop, it was invariably running some old, pre-installed, unconfigured
version of Fvwm. Occasionally it was Fvwm95, a superficial imitation of
Windows. But it was on my own freshly installed Red Hat Linux system that I
truly learned to loathe Fvwm.

</p><p>

I remember Red Hat&#39;s Fvwm setup as a byzantine web of config files written in
an indecipherable alien language--what I later learned to be M4 scripts. I
have vague, nightmarish memories of hot-pink titlebars, fat blocky window
borders, black and white load graphs, and garish pixmap buttons. And the
puke-green emacs background (at this time, I was too naive to understand what
Fvwm controlled and what Xdefaults controlled.) And the page-switch delay,
just long enough to be annoying if you were trying to switch, and just short
enough to be annoying if you weren&#39;t. And the insufferable sloppy focus.

</p><p>

My first timid attempts to tame this monstrosity were soundly squelched. Red
Hat&#39;s Fvwm was controlled, as mentioned, by a web of system files: it paid no
attention to any puny .fvwm2rc in the user&#39;s home directory. After a few weeks
of flailing, I gave up. I retreated to the comfort of the console, returning to
X only when a particularly insatiable Netscape-craving arose.

</p><hr noshade=""/><p>

Fast-forward a year or so. I&#39;ve gained a lot of confidence with the command
line--I&#39;m even doing a bit of *nix programming and scripting--but I still live
in fear of Fvwm. But wait! My shiny new Red Hat 6.2 comes with two new
alternatives: KDE and Gnome. I install KDE 1.1.2 and give it a whirl.

</p><p>

And I <i>love</i> it.

</p><p>

My god, it actually looks good. It actually makes sense. Who ever thought a
Linux window manager could do that? It&#39;s pointy and clicky, has a taskbar with
launchers, icons with more than 4 bits in the palette, and window borders that
aren&#39;t 3 inches thick. I click in a window, and it raises like it&#39;s supposed
to. There are even plain-english config files to play with!

</p><p>

KDE made me fall in love with Linux all over again. I could theme it, tweak it,
and generally make it do whatever I wanted. I started with the GUI
configuration utilities and worked my way into editing the config files by
hand. (Alas, I have no extant KDE1 screenshots to offer.)

</p><hr noshade=""/><p>

My first impression of KDE2 was dismal: I compiled it with over-aggressive
optimizations and ended up with a crashy, unstable desktop. This experience
propelled me into a whirlwind tour of alternate window managers, which ended
up being loads of fun and also gave me my first experience with tweaking WM
source code. If memory serves, I sampled Enlightenment, Window Maker, and
Afterstep briefly, spent a couple of weeks in BlackBox, and a couple more
in <a href="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/wm2/">wm2</a>. wm2 was the
subject of an ascetic streak, where, disgusted by the seeming excesses of KDE
and Enlightenment, I reveled for awhile in a minimalist environment. It was
also the first WM I hacked, thanks to its simple and well-written code.

</p><p>

In due time, I tired of minimalism, and started to miss my friendly old KDE. I
decided to give KDE 2.0 another chance. This time, I followed the advice
of various net pundits and compiled it with more conservative settings.
The result: a much more stable, though still slightly warty desktop.
Ironically, it also ran faster than it did with high optimizations!

</p><p>

Over time, KDE 2 and I became good friends. I never <i>fell in love</i>
quite the way I did with KDE 1--it bugged me that KDE was growing more
complex and less friendly to the casual hacker, and the more I grew as a
programmer the more it bugged me--but we had fun. I <i>really</i> liked the
new look, particularly the &#34;marble&#34; style and System++ window decorations.
I used Konqueror heavily--it never seemed quite as zippy as Netscape 4.x, but
it was certainly more modern and featureful. This phase lasted quite a while,
and included another brief code-hacking expedition. Here&#39;s what my desktop
looked like most of the time (click to enlarge):

</p><center>
<a href="http://ironphoenix.org/fvwm/terracliff.jpg"><img src="http://ironphoenix.org/fvwm/terracliff_tn.jpg" width="205" height="154" alt="KDE 2.0 (TerraCliff)"/></a>
</center>

<p>

The titlebars in this screenshot are the result of the aforementioned hacking
expedition. I tweaked the System++ plugin so that, like ModSystem, it uses
titlebar-foreground instead of window-background as its main titlebar color.
Result: it actually looks right :-) (The wishlist/patch for this was ignored
and eventually discarded from the KDE bug database without comment--am I the
only person who cares about System++?). For any who are interested, here&#39;s the
<a href="http://ironphoenix.org/fvwm/kde-patch">patch</a> as applied to KDE 2.2.2.

</p><p>

One other notable feature of this screenshot is the heavy use of Copland Gnome
icons, as distributed and tweaked for KDE by the creator of the Photon theme.

</p><hr noshade=""/><p>

My second departure from the KDE world came upon installing KDE 2.1. Unlike
most of the world, I was underwhelmed and disenchanted. It was even more
heavyweight than 2.0--it seemed like I sat at the desk for a full minute just
waiting for KDE to start up! Off I went on my second WM tour, with an eye for
the sleek, the fast, and the hacker-friendly. After a sampling of Sawfish and
a second taste of Enlightenment and BlackBox, I settled on Window Maker.

</p><p>

Window Maker had seemed unreasonably austere to me on my first try, and I also
had bad memories of the original NextStep which inspired it. This time, I
tried a little harder to get to know it, and dove into theming, menu editing,
and of course, dockapps. This was the next long leg of my Window Manager trek.
Window Maker never pleased me entirely; it always seemed a little too
restrictive and too quirky (e.g. the resize mechanism, the lack of a visual
pager, the &#34;clip&#34;, the silly contortions necessary to get one icon to launch
multiple xterms). I never really caught on to the Zen of Window Maker, I
guess. But it was Good Enough(tm), and it had style. A well-configured Window
Maker with lots of alpha-blended dock tiles and Largo icons looks very snappy
indeed.

</p><p>

Here&#39;s a shot showing one of my favorite Window Maker themes:

</p><center>
<a href="http://ironphoenix.org/fvwm/wmto.jpg"><img src="http://ironphoenix.org/fvwm/wmto_tn.jpg" width="205" height="154" alt="Window Maker (Themes.org)"/></a>
</center>

<hr noshade=""/><p>

So what finally led me away from Window Maker? It seemed the more I got to know
it, the more antsy I became. The same tight vision that gave Window Maker an
aura of style also made it inflexible and controlling. The developer community
mirrored this. The typical mailing list reaction to any suggestion of change
was not &#34;show us the patch&#34;, but &#34;over our dead bodies&#34;. The code itself was
out of my league, too complex and multi-layered for my budding X-programming
skills to work with. Attempts to make even small cosmetic changes failed.

</p><p>

I went back to KDE for a little while, which by now was up to version 2.2, but
quickly realized that I was heading in the opposite direction from where I
wanted to go. It had become entirely too heavyweight for my PII 333 (still okay
for a patient user, maybe--but I&#39;m not patient :-), and besides, it seemed less
casual-hacker-friendly than ever. The code was an enormous wriggling mass that
took a full day to compile. Mysterious binary files like &#34;ksyscoca&#34; inhabited
my ~/.kde. KDE 2.2 was eminently friendly and usable on a fast system, but it
did not encourage dabbling beyond the GUI configuration dialogs.

</p><p>

That&#39;s fine for many, but I was becoming more and more of a
source-code-twiddling, config-file-editing junkie. I decided to go looking
for a Window Manager that truly catered to the soul of a hacker.

</p><p>

You see where this is headed, don&#39;t you?

</p><p>

I decided it was time for me to face my old enemy, Fvwm. I had evolved quite a
bit since our last meeting, into less of a passive user and more of a hacker,
and had heard a lot of interesting rumors as well. I heard that Fvwm was
boundlessly flexible, and had hidden delights to offer those who could tame
it. I heard that it was scriptable beyond the dreams of mortals. I even heard
that, despite the contrary evidence of <i>almost every Fvwm screenshot in
existence</i>, it could actually look good! All of this turned out to be true.
And so I came full circle.

</p><p>

Now, let me play the role of proselytizer, and tell you some things you may
not know about this underrated little WM. Fvwm can be just about anything you
want it to be. The fat pink title bars and motif window decorations are not
obligatory--but that&#39;s only the beginning. Want click-to-focus? You&#39;ve got it.
Want cute dockapps? They work just fine in FvwmButtons. Want fancy pixmaps in
your titlebars? Go ahead. How about an MP3 playlist at the click of a mouse
button, or a menu-based file browser? Write a Perl script and use PipeRead.
Fvwm&#39;s dynamic menus are more powerful than those of any other Window Manager
I&#39;ve seen (save possibly AfterStep, its offspring).

</p><p>

You can make Fvwm look like just about any other WM you want. It can give an
almost perfect imitation of Window Maker, &#39;Doze, probably even BlackBox. But
let me warn you: it doesn&#39;t <i>want</i> to. Fvwm is Fvwm. It has a soul of its
own. It is not trendy. It is not l33t. It does not have a Vision. It doesn&#39;t
even have a pronounceable name (although the F is pronounced &#34;Feline&#34; :-). It
has a user base with lots of technical know-how but <a href="http://www.fvwm.org/screenshots/desktops/GlenLeeEdwards-desk4-1024x768/screenshot.gif">decidedly
odd ideas</a> about aesthetics. Fortunately, you&#39;re allowed to invent your own
beauty.

</p><p>

The soul of Fvwm is Frankenstein. Write a 20-page .fvwm2rc. Take the best
elements from all the other WM&#39;s and discard the rest, and Fvwm will be happy,
and so will you. Example: I recently surfed over to the website of a new
trendy WM called FluxBox. I noticed an item in the feature list, &#34;wheel scroll
changes workspace&#34;, and thought &#34;ah, neat idea&#34;. I pulled up my .fvwm2rc in
emacs, and a few minutes later, my mouse wheel changed workspaces. That is the
joy of Fvwm.

</p><p>

The more I use Fvwm, the less patience I have with the limitations of newer,
supposedly better Window Managers. I feel I&#39;m a slave to the preferences,
prejudices, and oversights of the author. Why can&#39;t I bind the keypad keys in
KDE, without having to use a modifier? Why can&#39;t I ever have more than two
titlebar buttons in Window Maker? What does BlackBox have against pixmaps? Why
do so few WM&#39;s bother to implement a proper virtual desktop?

</p><p>

You get the idea. Well, Fvwm goes the opposite route. You can have ten
different titlebar buttons if you really want. Believe it or not, some people
do.

</p><p>

Over time, I even grew to like a few of the same Fvwm hallmarks that had
repulsed me in the beginning. Sloppy focus, automatic page-switching, and
non-click-raises all won me over eventually. I now get claustrophobic in MS
Windows without other pages to move to, impatient when I can&#39;t change focus
with a nudge of the mouse or copy text in a window without raising it.

</p><p>

Another point of interest: Fvwm&#39;s source code. I had heard ominous mentions of
how old, crufty and complex it was, having been based on the original TWM, but
when I actually went in and played with it, I found the code quite clear and
easy to change. I was able to ameliorate one of the few aesthetic drawbacks of
Fvwm that could not be fixed by .fvwm2rc alone: the lack of
multiple-pixmap-themable titlebars. What&#39;s more, the developers warmly
welcomed my patch (after my showing off a screenshot or two :-) and added it
to CVS. Another such drawback--Fvwm&#39;s lack of PNG support--has also recently
been addressed. With alpha-blending, no less!

</p><p>

Oh--and Fvwm fully supports EWMH.

</p><p>

The developer community is low-key, but active and enthusiastic in their work.
This, for me, is a major plus, and stands in sharp contrast to the negative
vibes on the Window Maker mailing list. Contrary to popular belief, Fvwm is
far from a dead project. It isn&#39;t for everyone, but if you&#39;re the kind of
person who prefers <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> to Gmail, prefers
typing to clicking, gets annoyed when programs write their config files
without asking, and generally expects their WM to do what they say when they
say without a fuss, then it might just be for you. And if you&#39;re not that kind
of person, well...wait for it. Linux tends to have this effect on people :-)

</p><p>

So, on to the next screenshots. The below two depict a configuration I used
for quite some time, before finally discarding it in favor of my current
setup. Pager, mini-xterm, and icon manager / tasklist on the upper left,
<a href="http://www.gkrellm.net">gkrellm</a> the uber-monitor at lower right,
mini-snapshot of the current background in the pager.

</p><center>

</center>

<p>

My theming setup was/is built around a glorified Perl script, fvwm-theme. Each
theme specified a background, a window decor, a gkrellm skin, and an xterm
theme, and changing these settings en masse or individually was a matter of a
few mouse clicks.

</p><hr noshade=""/><p>

Having fallen head-over-heels for my old nemesis, I never parted ways with
Fvwm again--but I did decide to give KDE 2.2.2 a whirl on the side.
Background: I came home to Virginia for an extended visit with my parents,
while my husband and I sorted out Issues with the Canadian Immigration office.
It&#39;s a long story. Anyhow, my mother&#39;s shiny new 1 gig Athlon was soon running
Linux (<a href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a>, my new distro of
choice) alongside Windows XP, and given its horsepower, it seemed like a prime
candidate for KDE. And indeed, with a bit of spit and polish (iKons, new
splash screen. <a href="http://ironphoenix.org/fvwm/kde-patch">System++</a> patch), it ran well. Here&#39;s
what it looked like:

</p><center>
<a href="http://ironphoenix.org/fvwm/seaworld.jpg"><img src="http://ironphoenix.org/fvwm/seaworld_tn.jpg" width="205" height="154" alt="KDE 2.2.2 (Sea World)"/></a>
</center>

<p>

(The redheaded dolphin lover in the floral shirt is my mother.)

</p><p>

Back home in Canada, I decided, with some trepidation, to try installing the
latest KDE 3.0.1 on our old PII 333 (if only for my husband&#39;s sake--he likes
doing his thesis work in *nix, but he really doesn&#39;t like endlessly fiddling
with a window manager). So I did, and oy, it was slower than ever. Pretty,
though. Here&#39;s what my setup for him looked like:

</p><center>
<a href="http://ironphoenix.org/fvwm/kde3.jpg"><img src="http://ironphoenix.org/fvwm/kde3_tn.jpg" width="205" height="154" alt="KDE 3.0.1"/></a>
</center>

<p>

I will always have a soft spot in my heart for KDE, I think. Like Fvwm, its
developer community is active and friendly. KDE holds the original credit for
taking away my fear and loathing of X, and doubtless that of many other Linux
newbies. However, even my husband tired of its bloatedness eventually, and the
way said bloatedness taxed the resources of our aging computer. This led to
the creation of fvwm-desktop, a simple Windoze-esque desktop built on top of
Fvwm.

</p><center>
<a href="http://ironphoenix.org/fvwm/fvwm-desktop.jpg"><img src="http://ironphoenix.org/fvwm/fvwm-desktop-tn.jpg" width="205" height="154" alt="Fvwm Desktop Screenshot"/></a>
</center>

<hr noshade=""/><p>

And now, what you&#39;ve all been waiting for: my Fvwm Setup du jour. Despite
the awesome compact utility of gkrellm, I ended up discarding it. While gkrellm
looks just spiffy on space-age L33T desktops, the only time I run L33T desktops
is when I&#39;m making screenshots. Set against the naturey backgrounds and
wood-backed xterms I usually favor, gkrellm sticks out like a sore thumb, no
matter what skin it&#39;s wearing. So I replaced it with a handful of cute
dockapps, and my desktop has been more appealing ever since. As you&#39;ll see,
I also tired of the mini-wallpaper-in-the-pager trick.

</p><p>

So, without further ado, three brand new screenshots:

</p><center>

<p>

Want to learn more about my setup? I&#39;ve documented the whole thing
<a href="http://ironphoenix.org/fvwm/configs/">here</a>.

</p><p>

<i>ETA: This page was written over ten years ago, but I still use Fvwm to this
day (June 2014). And it still looks a lot like those final screenshots, except
that I no longer use the email notification dockapp (I have a &#34;message in a
bottle&#34; fall into my bubblemon instead) nor the sticky notes dockapp (I wrote
my own reminder program), and my bubblemon looks perpetually shallow now since
memory is cheap.
