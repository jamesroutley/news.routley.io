Other sellers, however good their offers might be, are effectively shut out.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement: “This claim is without merit and we’re confident that will become clear through the legal process.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">The lawsuit is expected to be filed at the CAT by the end of this month and will have to be certified by the tribunal before it can proceed.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">It is being brought on an “opt-out” basis, meaning that any potential claimants will be included in the claim unless they choose to opt out.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">The case follows the <a data-testid="Link" href="https://ntietz.com/technology/amazon-faces-uk-probe-over-marketplace-practices-2022-07-06/">announcement</a> by Britain’s antitrust watchdog in July that it is investigating Amazon over suspected breaches of competition law, including how it selects which products are placed within the “Buy Box” feature.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Amazon has faced similar probes elsewhere, recently making an <a data-testid="Link" href="https://ntietz.com/technology/amazon-offers-concessions-end-eu-antitrust-investigation-2022-07-14/">offer</a> to the European Commission to avert possible hefty EU antitrust fines.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">The platform has also <a data-testid="Link" href="https://ntietz.com/technology/amazon-declines-describe-search-algorithm-data-australian-regulator-2022-04-28/">declined</a> to describe its product-search system to an Australian competition regulator which has heard complaints of large marketplace platforms giving preference to in-house wares.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">The CAT <a data-testid="Link" href="https://ntietz.com/legal/litigation/google-faces-1-bln-uk-trial-over-app-store-pricing-2022-07-19/">authorised</a> an estimated 920 milion-pound ($1.1 billion) damages claim against Google <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GOOGL.O" target="_blank">(GOOGL.O)</a> in July and <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/default/files/2022-08/20220629_1403_Judgment_%5B2022%5D_CAT_28.pdf" target="_blank">approved</a> another case worth up to 1.7 billion pounds against Apple <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/AAPL.O" target="_blank">(AAPL.O)</a> in May.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">The tribunal is also due to decide in January whether to give the go-ahead to a claim valued at up to 2.2 billion pounds against Meta Platforms <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/META.O" target="_blank">(META.O)</a>, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, over alleged anti-competitive behaviour.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">Google and Apple deny the allegations against them, according to court filings, and Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p><div><div><h5 data-testid="Heading">Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Sam Tobin; Editing by Andrew Heavens</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
