    <ul>
<li>incredibly illegal friday weeknotes. i&#39;m on a most wanted list for bloggers now i&#39;m sure.</li>
<li>really enjoying <a href="https://webcurios.co.uk/">web curios</a> for, would you believe it, curios on the web, like <a href="https://www.crowdwave.com/">crowdwave</a>. love the idea of this site a lot even if i high-key assume i am unintelligible without captions (and the site would be better with captions anyway!), i know some people will love it.</li>
<li>researching for <a href="https://webdevconf.com/events/2024/">my talk next week in Bristol</a> and realising the <a href="https://undark.org/2023/05/25/where-the-wood-wide-web-narrative-went-wrong/">&#34;wood wide web&#34; isn&#39;t as cool as previously anticipated</a> made me sad but also is interesting. i learnt other cool things about soil and trees, for example did you know <a href="https://www.ceh.ac.uk/why-do-soil-microbes-matter#:~:text=Microbes%20are%20central%20to%20all,and%20around%2010%2C000%20different%20species.">1 teaspoon of soil</a> has about a billion microbes in it?</li>
<li>i definitely needed to refill my wonder cup. wonder as in awe. i make a practice of cultivating it as part of secular technopagan stuff, but i have fallen off all my practices hard recently. i like a quote i heard recently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong#:~:text=All%20models%20are%20wrong%2C%20but%20some%20are%20useful%22">&#34;all models are wrong, but some are useful&#34;</a>.</li>
<li>i want to get better at reading tarot for this reason but i keep forgetting i intend to do this until i randomly see my cards in my room on my desk and that&#39;s always in the middle of something else. habits are hard!</li>
<li>i&#39;m getting up earlier for work these days and it&#39;s nice having mornings, though weirdly i&#39;m finding it harder to sleep at night? thank you body for your contribution.</li>
<li>i keep wanting to write about online dating - not really here, more as a writing thing - but i feel like it&#39;s overdone. then again, i haven&#39;t seen much software criticism of dating apps (or software criticism in general besides <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/software-criticism/">wired</a> so maybe i should get over myself and make it anyway.</li>
