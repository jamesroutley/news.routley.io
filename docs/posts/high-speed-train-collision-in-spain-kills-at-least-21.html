At least 73 people were taken to hospital - 24 of them seriously injured, including four children - according to Andalusia&#39;s emergency services.</p><p>Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente described the incident as &#34;extremely strange&#34; as officials launched an investigation.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>All the railway experts consulted by the government &#34;are extremely baffled by the accident&#34;, Puente told reporters in Madrid.</p><p>Rail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the train left Málaga heading to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track.</p><p>The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, Puente said. He added that most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the second train, which was travelling from Madrid to Huelva.</p><p>The type of train involved in the crash was a Freccia 1000, which can reach top speeds of 400 km/h (250 mph), a spokesperson for the Italian rail company Ferrovie dello Stato told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Rescue teams said the twisted wreckage of the trains made it difficult to recover people trapped inside the carriages.</p><p>Córdoba fire chief Francisco Carmona told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE: &#34;We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work.&#34;</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp" loading="eager" alt="A map of Spain highlighting a section of the country’s high‑speed rail network.
