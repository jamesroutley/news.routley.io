                    <p>I&#39;m not entirely sure how to convey just how much journaling has helped me. More than therapy, more than drugs, I&#39;m talking <em>real</em> growth.</p>
                    <p>I&#39;m someone who has kept multiple journals throughout my life but never really felt they were super helpful - or they would be helpful at first, and the effect would wear off as time went on.</p>
                    <p>Some problems I ran into while trying to journal:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some days were &#39;uneventful&#39; and I felt I had nothing to write about. Sometimes I&#39;d have a string of uneventful days, and realize I had forgotten to write, and then felt guilty.</li>
                        <li>The &#39;eventful&#39; days made me feel like I didn&#39;t have the energy or will to sit down and journal about it.
                        </li>
                        <li>I felt like I had no idea what I wanted to write about, so I just wrote down a bunch of things aimlessly and, while it felt somewhat nice to do, it felt kind of useless.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I stumbled upon a really great journaling method by aggressively journaling every
                        single day in completely different ways until I found something that provided me with relief and answers. I didn&#39;t stop until I found a method that felt that it was actually helping me, like therapeutically, in a real way.</p>

                    <p>For this to be truly effective, it&#39;s important for me to approach journaling by acknowledging that I am the only one in the universe who <em>truly</em> knows - or <em>can</em> know myself fully, because I am the one who is stuck being me all of the time. Therefore, on some level, I am the only one who holds the answer for the majority of my inner-questions and dilemmas. (e.g., only you know what you want, even if you haven&#39;t uncovered it yet).</p>
                    <p><strong>When journalling:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I must <strong>be completely honest</strong> and make no attempt to hide from thoughts or feelings that arise. This can only be done (for me, personally) when I&#39;m sure that no one&#39;s eyes will ever see it. Only then do I allow myself to be completely open.</li>
                        <li>I must acknowledge my internal dialogue - more than one voice with differing perspectives that both reside inside of me. This means making my entry more of a dialogue, one that explores many avenues and looks at things from all sides.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I try to keep these things in mind at all times.</p>
                    <h2>The Internal Dialogue</h2>
                    <p>I want to expand a little on what &#34;internal dialogue&#34; means and how it differs from monologue. A monologue is when you&#39;re talking <em>at</em> something, like a crowd of people, or an empty wall. A dialogue is when there is <em>an exchange of ideas and opinions.</em></p>
                    <p>Humans are fluid creatures with complex pasts and often hold contradictory opinions and beliefs without realizing it. In fact, we do a lot of things without realizing it, mainly when we&#39;re stuck on <strong>auto-pilot</strong> and not thinking too much about anything at all.</p>
                    <p>Writing about these types of things is committing to unpack them, to chisel away the outer levels to get to the core.</p>
                    <p>At first, I found it strange and unnatural to try and have a dialogue with myself. Instead, everything came out like a monologue. I think what helped me in the beginning was writing my journals like a script of dialogue with questions and answers - both provided by me and approached with honesty and genuinely being open to figuring it out. Once I started asking questions and committed to answering them fully and honestly, and exploring those answers in depths, I started to feel this bring me actual relief.</p>
                    <p>It might be different for others, but for me I mainly feel the dialogue emerge from two different parts of myself. One part is less developed/more instinctual and emotional and the other more responsible, empathetic, and mature. The dialogue is mainly between these two figures, although I always seem to identify most with the former.</p>
                    <p>I don&#39;t write them out as a script anymore, and found a way to work with both voices in a more journal-like format. Sometimes, I really get into it and words just pour out of me. I end up revealing things I don&#39;t expect and coming to conclusions that actually satisfy me. It almost feels like automatic writing, but instead of channeling a spirit you&#39;re channeling your thoughts.</p>
                    <p>In theory I guess this could work as a thought exercise too, but I am terrible at &#34;hanging on&#34; to my thoughts in any meaningful way. For me to properly engage with an idea, I need to write it out.</p>

                    <p>Because this activity is <strong>intentional,</strong> it means I don&#39;t need to journal every day just for the sake of journaling. There are no daily achievements or sense of responsibility to write aimlessly. Instead I reserve journaling for when I <em>need to</em> figure out why I&#39;m feeling a certain way, or how to solve a problem.</p>
                    <p>That means sometimes I start writing and know exactly what to write about, and sometimes I don&#39;t. The point of this exercise is to write it out, figure it out through investigation of your own answers and thoughts.</p>
                    <h2>Summary:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be completely open and honest with yourself.</li>
                        <li>Engage in a dialogue with yourself - ask questions and answer them as fully as you can.</li>
                        <li>Interview yourself about your thoughts and emotions. Especially important is &#34;why&#34;?</li>
                        <li>Refute your own ideas, if you need to - explain to yourself why you&#39;re wrong</li>
                        <li>When you figure out an issue to focus on, focus your writing on getting to the core of that issue</li>
                        <li>Talk to and treat yourself during these exercises as you&#39;d talk to or treat a close friend.</li>
                    </ul>
