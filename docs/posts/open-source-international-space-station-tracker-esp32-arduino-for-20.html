    <h1>Show HN: Open-Source International Space Station Tracker ESP32/Arduino for $20</h1>

<p dir="auto">SpaceStationTracker is an application that displays the current position of the International Space Station on a 2D world map.
It runs on a ESP32-2432S028R ILI9341 device with a 2.8&#34; screen, commonly known as the CYD &#34;Cheap Yellow Display&#34;,
which costs $20 or less. The code was written using Arduino IDE / ESP32 development environment in c++.</p>

<p dir="auto">I used this project to learn programming for ESP32/Arduino/CYD.
It includes topics such as graphics using LVGL, wifi connection, getting
information from a restful API, parsing json data, and touchscreen interaction.
This would make a great space related STEM classroom project.</p>
<p dir="auto">As of the time of writing, the end of life for the ISS is slated for 2030.
This code could be repurposed for other orbiting space objects.</p>

<p dir="auto">The SpaceStationTracker requires a local Wifi connection to retrieve location data
for the International Space Station. The first time you load and run the app on the CYD, it will
display a splash screen for how to connect. The ESP32 board will create a hotspot
that you can then connect to from a phone or laptop. Choose your Wifi network and
enter your credentials to connect the CYD to your Wifi. This is a safer method than
hard coding Wifi info in the application, as with many esp32 DIY projects out there.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once the app is connected to Wifi, it will continue to display and track the
International Space Station. The esp32 will remember the last Wifi connection
when cycling power, and if it changes you will be prompted to re connect using the above method.</p>

<p dir="auto">The Latitude, Longitude, and UTC date time is displayed in real time, updating from
the Where The ISS At API.
You can use the touchscreen and click on the ISS icon to display a random
fact about the ISS.</p>
<p dir="auto">The screen brightness will dim automatically over a few minutes to save power,
and will go to full brightness again when the user interacts with the touchscreen.</p>

<p dir="auto">I bought my CYD from this link on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG2WQGP9" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> for less than $20, but many places sell them.
Keep in mind there are several variations that can be called a CYD. Make sure it is the resistive touch (as opposed to
capacitive touch), and 2.8 inch screen, otherwise this code will not work. The designator for this model is &#34;ESP32-2432S028R&#34;
Some versions have a micro USB, and some have both a micro USB and USB C. Either USB should work, but keep in mind
when getting a cable. I liked the above package from that particular Amazon seller, because it came with a
USB micro cable and case for the board.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is a great article on <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/cheap-yellow-display-esp32-2432s028r/" rel="nofollow">Random Nerd Tutorials</a> to get you started with the CYD.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is not a specific case for this project, but there are many 3D printed cases available for the CYD.
Choose one that suits your needs, here are some <a href="https://www.printables.com/tag/cyd" rel="nofollow">examples</a>.
Be aware of the differences in the printable models if you want to use the micro USB vs. the USB C cable.</p>

<ol dir="auto">
<li>Configure Arduino IDE </li>
<li>Install the libraries below in Arduino IDE</li>
<li>You can copy the entire SpaceStationTracker repository into ~/Documents/Arduino/</li>
<li>Plug in your CYD over USB to your computer, connect in the Arduino IDE, and compile and upload the SpaceStationTracker code using the Arduino IDE.
To reset the CYD to get ready for install, you may need to hold the BOOT button, then press and release the RESET button,
and then release the BOOT button. These are the small white buttons located on the back of the CYD board. They are labeled &#34;RST&#34; and BOOT&#34;.</li>
