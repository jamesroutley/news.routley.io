    <h1>FAQ on Leaving Google</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><em>Context: When I was laid off from Google, I knew I&#39;d be deluged with
questions.  I wrote this FAQ to share with friends and family, to
prevent repeated explanation.  But my other goal was to help so many
of my co-workers process and understand the repeated waves of mass
layoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>
<p>Google just did another big round of layoffs.  I was part of them,
along with hundreds of others.  Many of us had long tenure or
seniority; my run was 18 years!</p>
<p><strong>Oh no!  But why were <em>you</em> targeted?</strong></p>
<p>I wasn’t personally targeted, I didn’t mess up.  In fact these layoffs
were extremely impersonal.  Google seems to be carrying out generic
initiatives to save operational cost.  I was an Engineering Director
with “only” 35 reports (rather than a typical 80+ people), and so it’s
likely that some heuristic decided that the business could do fine
without me.</p>
<p><strong>This is unfair!  After all you’ve done, how could Google do this to
you?</strong></p>
<p>Please understand: <em>Google is not a person.</em> It’s many groups of
people following locally-varying processes, rules, and culture.  To
that end, it makes no sense to either love or be angry at “Google”;
it’s not a consciousness, and it has no sense of duty nor debt.</p>
<p><strong>Are you OK?  I’m so sorry!  How are you coping?</strong></p>
<p>I’m fine.  :-) Google culture changed dramatically last year with its
first major round of layoffs, and I saw the writing on the wall.  I’ve
been preparing myself for this (increasingly inevitable) event for
months now – which included plenty of time for all the stages of
grief.  If anything, I have a mixed set of emotions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>enormous pride in building a Chicago Engineering office over
decades, and achieving really cool things in the Developer, Ads, and
Search divisions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deep gratitude in getting to work with some of the most intelligent,
creative people in the world;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a sense of relief.  The conflict between “uncomfortable culture” and
“golden handcuffs” was becoming intolerable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve seen long-tenured leaders exit Google and go into an identity
crisis; that’s not me.  :-)</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://www.red-bean.com/sussman/">zillion hobbies and shadow
careers</a> – plenty of things to do
and paths to follow.  The <em>first</em> order of business, however, is
probably a long-overdue sabbatical.  After 25+ years in tech, I need a
few months to rest and recover!</p>
<p>I’ll soon publish a couple of ‘post-mortem’ stories.  The first will
be about my own career at Google, and the second will be about how
I’ve seen Google culture change over time.</p>
