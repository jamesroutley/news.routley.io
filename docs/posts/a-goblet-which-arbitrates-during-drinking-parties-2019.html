    <h1>A goblet which arbitrates during drinking parties (2019)</h1>

		<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Introduction</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">It is a tall goblet made of silver. The goblet has a fretted, flat lid with a beautiful dome in the center. On top of the dome, there is a duck with an open beak. The goblet is put in the middle of the party, and wine is poured. The duck rotates and emits a shrill tone until it comes to rest and stops whistling; its beak is pointed towards one of the participants who drink from the spout and empties all the wine and returns it to the steward, If however, any wine remains in it the duck whistles and the steward would not accept the goblet until the chosen one completed the drinking.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The technical explanation will be colored in <span>blue</span> as always, so anyone who is not interested in how a pitcher of wine makes sounds and how you know how much wine was drank can skip those bits. The drawing below is by the book translator and annotator, Donald R.Hill. It would help us to follow the mechanism:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The servant pours the wine on the fretted lid. The wine flows downward through the opening on the water wheel. Please see below the beautiful drawing by al-Jazari, which looks just like a modern turbine of NASA. The flow of wine hits the blades and rotates the wheel and the duck, which is on the axle. The wine goes down into the channel into the goblet, driving the air from through the air pipe and the whistle. When the drinker drinks from the spout, the wine goes back in the opposite direction, but if the drinker did not finish the wine, it will come back and push air in the pipe, and the duck will make a sound indicating that the drinker did not complete his duty</span>.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Alcohol?</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">I am not an expert on Islam and its development, but the casual reference to alcohol drinking surprised me very much. I’ve explored the issue a little bit, but I would love to receive your corrections, comments, or other proposals. The prohibition on alcohol in the holy Quran is gradual. Muslims believe that Allah did so in his great wisdom and understanding of human nature and the knowledge of how rooted is alcohol consumption. In the beginning, Muslims were prohibited from participating in prayers when drunk:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Surah An-Nisa [4:43]<strong><em>:</em></strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr"><p>“O you who have attained to faith! Do not attempt to pray while you are in a</p>
<p>state of drunkenness, [but wait] until you know what you are saying”</p>
<p>Further, it is said that alcohol is more damage than good:</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Surah al-Baqarah 2:219:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr"><p>“They will ask thee about intoxicants and games of chance. Say: “In both there is great evil as well as some benefit for man; but the evil which they cause is greater than the benefit which they bring.”</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">And only, at last, there is a sweeping prohibition:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Surah Al-Maida, 5:90</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr"><p>“O you who have attained to faith! Intoxicants, and games of chance, and idolatrous practices, and the divining of the future are but a loathsome evil of Satan’s doing: shun it, then, so that you might attain to a happy state!</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">All English translation by Muhammad Asad.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the prohibition on drinking wine and intoxicating beverages in Islam, you can find many testimonies for drinking alcohol in the medieval Islamic world in language, culture, and poetry.  The word “alcohol” itself comes from the Arabic word al-kuhul (الْكُحْل) means the essence. This is because the production process is reminiscent of the production of the Kahal powder used as a dark eye-coloring cosmetic. In poetry, Abu Nuwas, probably the most famous Arab poet of the Abbasid era who also appears in <em>“Thousand Nights and Nights,”</em> wrote wine poems, The Khamriyyāt. You can be read more <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vintage-Humour-Islamic-Poetry-Nuwas/dp/1849048975">here</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr"><p>“Don’t cry for Layla, don’t rave about Hind!</p>
<p>But drink among roses a rose-red wine,</p>
<p>A drought that descends in the drinker’s throat,</p>
<p>bestowing its redness on eyes and cheeks.</p>
<p>The wine is a ruby, the glass is a pearl,</p>
<p>served by the hand of a slim-fingered girl,</p>
<p>Who serves you the wine from her hand, and wine</p>
<p>from her mouth — doubly drunk, for sure, will you be!”</p></blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">“The drawing is from the manuscript <em>“The Story of Bayad and Riyad”</em><em>(</em> <em>حديث بيا</em>ض ورياض).  This is the only manuscript left; it was probably created in Andalusia very close to 1200 (the years in which al-Jazari wrote “The Book of knowledge of Ingenious mechanical devices”) The scene in the picture is clearly a feast in which a group of women and men drink wine together.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The goblet which arbitrates is evidence that the court of Diyarbakir has lived with this contradiction in peace. There are plenty of references to Islam and its customs in the book, and there are playful fun drinking parties without any apology or concealment. We only have to guess the explanation. The Arctic rulers lived among a diverse local population, including Armenians, Syrians, and Greeks, most of them oriental Christians. In Christianity, not only wine is not forbidden, but it is a part of the ritual. At the Last Supper of Jesus, Jesus blesses the wine, states that the wine is his blood, and instructs the disciples to drink from it. Then he passed unleavened bread around the table and explained to his Apostles that the bread represents his body. These are the roots of the Holy Communion ceremony. It is possible that living together led to a softer approach to drinking wine. However, the evidence for alcohol use comes from all over the Muslim world from Persia to Andalusia and also spans for hundreds of years. I may be dumping the strict current prohibition on periods where the perception of early and late in the holy Quran was different and religious concepts were more moderate.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Truth or Dare?</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">My beloved M., the first reader of my posts, commented on the resemblance between the rotating duck and the bottle in the game “Truth or Dare”. This is a party game I last played as a teenager and was particularly popular among adolescents. The Internet offers application (few!), which make me feel that what was daring at my time is quite innocent today. On the other hand, it seems as though the game is still popular and therefore needs have not really changed?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Seemingly, this is a different game. The participants sit in a circle and spin a bottle. The participant to whom the bottle was pointed was asked: “Truth or Dare?” If you choose “truth”, you are asked a question that you must answer. At the time, all the questions were opened in: “Is it true that…” And most of them, if not all, dealt with things that are between him and her. If you choose “Dare”, you are given a task that opens with words “I dare you..” and most of those were the first kisses or something ridiculous. The question I think is why we need a bottle? Or in the context of the goblet which arbitrate why in duck?  Adolescents, at least in my time, were embarrassed about discovering their sexuality and the relationship with the opposite sex. The use of a game frame and temporary loss of control for the benefit of the “bottle” allowed expanding the boundaries and experimenting with what was difficult to ask or say without the protection of the game and could bring about embarrassment or reprimand. Does this mean that the partners at the banquet needed a duck that arbitrates because they felt discomfort with drinking alcohol? is this a question mark on my assumption that the goblet is clear evidence that the court of Diyarbakir lived with this contradiction in peace?</p>
