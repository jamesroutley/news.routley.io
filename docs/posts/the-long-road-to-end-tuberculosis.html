The goal of the procedure is to crush cavities hollowed out by the bacteria. And although Mann includes some literary flourishes, he accurately captures the crudeness of the procedure: “Then he begins, with a blunt instrument — it must be blunt, not to pierce through too soon…”</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cae29a7-5e4a-458a-b55c-c20108149ebd_1024x722.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cae29a7-5e4a-458a-b55c-c20108149ebd_1024x722.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cae29a7-5e4a-458a-b55c-c20108149ebd_1024x722.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cae29a7-5e4a-458a-b55c-c20108149ebd_1024x722.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cae29a7-5e4a-458a-b55c-c20108149ebd_1024x722.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cae29a7-5e4a-458a-b55c-c20108149ebd_1024x722.jpeg" width="1024" height="722" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0cae29a7-5e4a-458a-b55c-c20108149ebd_1024x722.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:722,&#34;width&#34;:1024,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:45847,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;topImage&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cae29a7-5e4a-458a-b55c-c20108149ebd_1024x722.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cae29a7-5e4a-458a-b55c-c20108149ebd_1024x722.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cae29a7-5e4a-458a-b55c-c20108149ebd_1024x722.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cae29a7-5e4a-458a-b55c-c20108149ebd_1024x722.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>A TB patient is subjected to an artificial pneumothorax operation.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Physicians working in the early 20th century had little choice but to treat the world’s most rampant infectious disease with methods such as these. Even after microbiologists discovered the bacterium that causes the illness in 1882, it wasn’t until the 1920s that researchers were able to develop a vaccine for TB.</p><p><span>These breakthroughs have significantly curbed cases, with vaccination reducing the odds of death by </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10678663/" rel="">74 percent</a><span>. But even now, more than a century later, TB remains the deadliest infectious disease on Earth, killing about 1.2 million people every year.</span></p><p><span>Despite TB’s prevalence, researchers have not produced and launched preventatives and treatments for the disease beyond a vaccine for children, developed in 1919, and antibiotic regimes similar to those developed in the 1950s. But they will need to do so if they want to meet the goals set out by the </span><a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/the-end-tb-strategy" rel="">End TB Strategy</a><span>, namely, to reduce TB cases by 80 percent and curb deaths by 90 percent before 2030.</span></p><p>As an undergraduate biology student, I spent some time in a TB lab working on antibiotic resistance — a growing concern for drug developers. The experience showed me that new therapies are needed not only to meet the targets laid out by the End TB Strategy but also to prevent drug resistance from negating the effectiveness of current therapeutics. Fortunately, some novel preventatives and therapies are in the works, including a vaccine equipped with adjuvants that efficiently prime the immune system and newer antibiotics against which the bacteria have yet to evolve resistance. </p><p>Still, while these developments provide cause for hope, each drug or vaccine faces a variety of challenges, ranging from financial incentives for clinical trials to the difficulty of discovering new antimicrobials that pass safety and efficacy tests.</p><p><span>Two French bacteriologists named Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin set out to develop a vaccine against </span><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em><span> at the beginning of the 20th century. Working at the famed Pasteur Institute, the duo began by figuring out </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749764/" rel="">how best to culture mycobacteria</a><span> — a seemingly simple, but essential first step, given how no one at the time had yet come up with an effective way of growing these bacteria in the laboratory.</span></p><p>In a series of experiments performed between 1900 and 1908, Calmette and Guérin developed a recipe for a growth medium suitable for mycobacteria. To feed bacterial growth, they used potato extracts rich in sugar and other nutrients. In time, the bacterial populations would consume all the resources in the medium, so Calmette and Guérin had to periodically transfer a small number of bacteria onto fresh media — a process known as subculturing.</p><p><span>During the First World War, the French duo also invented a method to freeze their cultures in case wartime rationing limited potato supplies.</span><sup></sup><span> However, ice crystals expand and shatter bacterial membranes, killing the microbes. To protect against this, Calmette and Guérin added a small amount of glycerin, a cryoprotectant, to slow ice crystal formation. Their mycobacteria cultures grew well in the amalgam and could be frozen and thawed time and time again. Finally, the team added ox bile, rich in fat-dissolving enzymes and bile salts, to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749764/" rel="">disperse clumps of bacteria</a><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa16e3fd4-0269-4ab6-ab2a-4e7be782674d_530x516.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa16e3fd4-0269-4ab6-ab2a-4e7be782674d_530x516.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa16e3fd4-0269-4ab6-ab2a-4e7be782674d_530x516.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa16e3fd4-0269-4ab6-ab2a-4e7be782674d_530x516.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa16e3fd4-0269-4ab6-ab2a-4e7be782674d_530x516.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa16e3fd4-0269-4ab6-ab2a-4e7be782674d_530x516.jpeg" width="530" height="516" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a16e3fd4-0269-4ab6-ab2a-4e7be782674d_530x516.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:516,&#34;width&#34;:530,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:43176,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa16e3fd4-0269-4ab6-ab2a-4e7be782674d_530x516.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa16e3fd4-0269-4ab6-ab2a-4e7be782674d_530x516.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa16e3fd4-0269-4ab6-ab2a-4e7be782674d_530x516.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa16e3fd4-0269-4ab6-ab2a-4e7be782674d_530x516.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>Camille Guérin (left) and Albert Camette (right) at the Pasteur Institute.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>With their newly-optimized medium in-hand, the French scientists grew and repeatedly subcultured the bacterial colonies. They used </span><em>M. bovis</em><span>, a bacterial species related to </span><em>M. tuberculosis</em><span>, to develop the vaccine. This species is more adapted to infecting cattle than humans, so they reasoned it would be less likely to cause serious infections in people and be easier to work with during subculturing experiments.</span></p><p>Serendipitously, it was the subculturing step that became the key to developing a vaccine: As the bacteria adapted to the media over many growth cycles, they lost their ability to cause disease, becoming harmless microbes that could prime the immune system.</p><p><span>After 230 rounds of subculturing between 1908 and 1919, Calmette and Guérin produced a “live-attenuated” strain of the bacterium, unable to cause TB in cattle, guinea pigs, horses, or rabbits.

Instead, different vaccine manufacturers </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749764/" rel="">in Bulgaria, Denmark, Japan, Russia</a><span>, and other countries have individually subcultured the BCG strain. Consequently, their strains may have accumulated genetic discrepancies, diverging over time from the original variant. These genetic differences are so pronounced that some strains have even </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8631702/" rel="">relinquished a sizable fragment</a><span> of the genome. Owing to these differences, it could very well be that some suppliers provide a more effective variant than others.</span></p><p><span>Another explanation is that </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749764/" rel="">harmless </a><em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749764/" rel="">Mycobacterium </a></em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749764/" rel="">species</a><span> that are genetically related to </span><em>M. tuberculosis</em><span> are also in circulation, and people exposed to one of these strains tend to have reduced immunity against others.

Since the cell’s outer armor slows down the entry of antibiotics, several drugs used to treat </span><em>M. tuberculosis</em><span> operate by tearing down the wall, including </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7502851/" rel="">isoniazid and ethambutol</a><span>. Drugs that have been tested on other types of bacteria often can’t be used to treat drug-resistant </span><em>M. tuberculosis</em><span> infections because of this distinction.</span></p><p><span>The thick wall around the bacterium isn’t the only barrier to entry for antibiotics, either.

As is commonplace for many clinical trials, the control arm takes a placebo — a sham vaccine consisting of no more than sugar dissolved in an inert buffer.

Pharmacologists have also applied machine learning to find </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3607962/" rel="">five antimalarial drugs</a><span> with similar TB-fighting potential. Many more could emerge as machine learning tools improve.</span></p><p><span>Another approach to discovering antibiotics involves using machine learning in parallel with scaled-up laboratory experiments. The primary screening of strains to prioritize expanded chemistry and targets (</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1315-z" rel="">PROSPECT</a><span>) tool, developed by biologists at Harvard University, rapidly finds compounds that target specific bacterial proteins. The protocol involves generating 474 mutants of </span><em>M. tuberculosis</em><span> by removing important genes, thus rendering them hypersensitive to drugs compared with bacteria equipped with a full genome. The researchers then subjected these mutants to over 3,000 different compounds, measuring how well each one killed off various mutants to build a dataset with millions of correlations between chemicals and genes. To whittle these down to a few interesting hits, they used a machine learning model trained to detect which interactions between compounds and bacterial proteins are likely to elicit a therapeutic effect based on existing therapies.</span></p><p><span>The researchers were left with 40 drug candidates. These targeted different bacterial components, including RNA polymerases that control gene expression plus enzymes involved in synthesizing the bacterium’s unique cell wall. The most alluring compounds target bacterial components that previous drug discovery efforts missed, including an efflux pump called EfpA that </span><a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aac.00261-24#" rel="">recent research shows</a><span> may confer resistance to frontline antibiotics, namely isoniazid, by expelling them from inside the cell.</span></p><p>The value of machine learning extends beyond finding new antibiotics or repurposing old drugs. It can also help scientists rapidly uncover the mechanism of action for entirely new drug candidates. </p><p><span>The morphological evaluation and understanding of stress (</span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2002738117" rel="">MorphEUS</a><span>) algorithm is a machine-learning driven imaging platform that deciphers which biological pathways a drug targets based on morphological changes to the cell, such as the shape of its DNA nucleoid or the integrity of its cell wall. For example, MorphEUS can detect that antibiotics like ethambutol and isoniazid break down the cell wall by measuring how it grows thinner over time. Researchers used this tool to classify the molecular pathways targeted by 37 antibiotics.</span></p><p>As researchers identify new drug candidates to treat TB, they must also work out how effective they are when paired with other antibiotics in combination therapy. And the number of combinations that researchers can test is growing rapidly. </p><p><span>There are over 23,000 ways that scientists can group the existing 28 TB drugs into combinations of three or four antibiotics. Instead of experimentally validating all these combinations, researchers developed an AI model called inferring drug interactions using chemogenomics and orthology (</span><a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.02627-19" rel="">INDIGO</a><span>) to predict whether combined drugs synergize or antagonize each other. Their model leverages data on how each drug performs alone at inhibiting </span><em>M. tuberculosis</em><span> growth and uses transcriptomic data from each drug to determine drug-gene interactions. </span></p><p>Using INDIGO, researchers found that some drug combinations work better than others, and some cancel out each other’s effects. In general, drugs that inhibit bacterial growth amplify each other’s impact when mixed together, but bacteria-killing drugs tend to mesh poorly when paired with other antibiotics. As new drugs pour in, this tool could help predict which drug combinations maximize impact.</p><p><span>Scientists at Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria are also searching for drugs that complement and enhance current antibiotics, but without using machine learning. They have already shown, for example, that statins such as </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10100658/" rel="">atorvastatin</a><span>, which normally lower “bad” cholesterol, may also </span><a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iuatld/ijtld/2023/00000027/00000012/art00007" rel="">help antibiotics</a><span> diffuse across the cholesterol layer on the surface of </span><em>M. tuberculosis</em><span>. Rather than producing their own cholesterol, the </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2393810/" rel="">pathogen sequesters these molecules from the host</a><span>, so the effectiveness of these statins could be linked to lowering overall cholesterol levels in the body. Many people with TB struggle to commit to long-term treatment programs, so the boost in efficacy that statins provide to antibiotics could lead to shorter treatments overall. </span></p><p>In the end, incentivizing patients to take their medicine as prescribed — or finding ways to shorten treatment plans — could prove just as important as finding new antibiotics.</p><p>When I interned in the TB laboratory as a biology student intrigued by infectious diseases, I knew very little about this condition. My classes had focused on flu, polio, and other pathogenic threats, but TB took up little attention; so you can imagine my surprise when I learned I had joined a research group striving to take down the world’s greatest infectious killer. But what has become a forgotten pandemic in developed, Western countries pervades the lives of many people in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia.</p><p>Excited as I was to contribute to TB research, I grew disillusioned by the pharmaceutical industry’s indifference to it. </p><p><span>Despite the initial promise of GSK’s M72/AS01E vaccine, the company chose to </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-big-pharma-company-stalled-tuberculosis-vaccine-to-pursue-bigger-profits" rel="">pivot</a><span> to a more lucrative shingles vaccine that used the same adjuvants despite their short supply, thereby stalling research into the new TB vaccine until a decade later, when the Gates Foundation began funding the phase 3 trial.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, even in the face of the growing threat of drug resistance, research has moved away from antibiotic discovery efforts to explore more profitable medicines. Developing and launching a new antibiotic costs </span><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.3c00189" rel="">$1.5 billion</a><span> U.S. dollars, whereas cancer therapies require only $640 million to make overall. Antibiotics also rake in less revenue, approximately $46 million per year, as compared to cancer treatments ($1.7 billion per year), leaving big pharma with little incentive to focus on this forgotten pandemic. TB researchers often find themselves frustrated to realize that we may never control this global burden as long as big pharma lacks the financial incentive to take up research on less profitable but widely neglected therapies.</span></p><p><span>However, hope prevails. We have controlled other bacterial pests once common in the developing world through the top-down work of health agencies and drug developers and the bottom-up efforts of local volunteers. Back in the 1950s, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4655361/" rel="">50 million people</a><span> used to suffer from yaws, a disfiguring skin disease caused by </span><em>Treponema pallidum pertenue</em><span>, a close relative of the syphilis bacterium. That number shrank to approximately </span><a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/yaws-endemic-treponematoses" rel="">223,000 cases</a><span> by 2023. Mass treatment campaigns have also quelled </span><em>Mycobacterium leprae</em><span>, a relative of </span><em>M. tuberculosis</em><span> that causes leprosy. Global cases of leprosy dropped from </span><a href="https://www.internationaltextbookofleprosy.org/chapter/epidemiology-leprosy" rel="">over 5.2 million</a><span> in 1985 to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10765565/" rel="">250,000</a><span> today thanks to antibiotic treatment efforts.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"
