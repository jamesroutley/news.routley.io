    <h1>Show HN: Rebrain.gg – Doom learn, don&#39;t doom scroll</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi HN,</p><p>I built <a href="https://rebrain.gg" rel="nofollow">https://rebrain.gg</a>. It&#39;s a website which is intended to help you learn new things.</p><p>I built it for two reasons:</p><p>1. To play around with different ways of interacting with a LLM. Instead of a standard chat conversation, the LLM returns question forms the user can directly interact with (and use to continue the conversation with the LLM).</p><p>2. Because I thought it would be cool to have a site dedicated to interactive educational content instead of purely consuming content (which I do too much).</p><p>An example of a (useful-for-me) interactive conversation is: <a href="https://rebrain.gg/conversations/6" rel="nofollow">https://rebrain.gg/conversations/6</a>. In it I&#39;m learning how to use the `find` bash command. (Who ever knew to exclude a directory from a look-up you need to do `find . -path &lt;path&gt; -exclude -o &lt;what you want to look for&gt;`, where `-o` stands for &#34;otherwise&#34;!)</p><p>Still very early on, so interested in and open to any feedback.</p><p>Thanks!</p></div></div></div>
