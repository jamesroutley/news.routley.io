    <h1>Project managers, ducks, and dogs marking territory (2013)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
There&#39;s a story I read on one of the Stack Overflow type sites a couple 
of years ago about a &#34;duck&#34;.  It was an answer about terms people have 
invented in the world of programming, and it went like this.
</p>
<p>
A company was working on a game called Battle Chess.  It looks like an 
ordinary chess game at first, but there are some extras which become 
apparent as you make moves.  When you select a piece and tell it to 
move, it morphs from a statue into more of an animated figure, and walks 
to the next spot.  Then it goes back to being a statue.
</p>
<p>
So far, that&#39;s nice, but there&#39;s more.  What happens when you make one 
piece encounter another?  Ah, yes, that&#39;s when they fight.  Both pieces 
come to life and start duking it out right there on the chess board.  
Obviously, it can only &#34;win&#34; according to the rules of the game, but you 
get to watch them hack and slash at each other.
</p>
<p>
I think the rook actually <em>picks up and eats</em> the queen, but 
it&#39;s been many years so don&#39;t hold me to that.  I know there must have 
been a bunch of combinations of animations which I never saw.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, about the duck.  As the story goes, the artists had created all 
of these animation cycles for their game, and it had to pass through the 
review stage of a project manager.  One of the artists knew the way 
these guys tended to want to &#34;leave their mark&#34; on things, and did 
something a little extra.
</p>
<p>
Apparently, the queen was given a little companion.  As she came to life 
and moved around, so did the duck.  It would just follow her around the 
board.
</p>
<p>
Supposedly, the PM saw this and said &#34;it&#39;s great... just remove the 
duck&#34;.  So, the artist went in and removed the duck (which had been 
carefully placed to make that easy), and that was that.  The sacrificial 
duck kept the meddling manager away from the stuff that was important.
</p>
<p>
When I first read this story, I figured it only applied to artistic 
situations like that.  I&#39;ve since thought about it some more and now 
believe it can come up far more often.
</p>
<p>
Have you ever noticed how some people want to &#34;touch&#34; everything which 
is being done on a project, even if it has nothing to do with them?  It 
need not be huge, but it seems like they want to have just a small 
deviation applied to all potential changes.  It&#39;s almost like they want 
to be able to point at any given part and say &#34;I&#39;m the reason that 
happened&#34;.
</p>
<p>
It reminded me of something else.  Think about what dogs do when you 
take them out into the world.  Show them a tree or a fire hydrant, and I 
bet they&#39;re going to mark it.  Walk a little bit more, and find another 
tree or similar post, and I bet the dog will mark it, too.  It&#39;s like 
they keep something in reserve so they can keep marking as they go.
</p>
<p>
Given this, what exactly is the difference between these people and 
dogs who claim territory by lifting their legs on things?
