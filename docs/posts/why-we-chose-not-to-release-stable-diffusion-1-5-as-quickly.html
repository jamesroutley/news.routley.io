While closed AI systems have seen very limited use cases, innovators and entrepreneurs have already woven Stable Diffusion into an amazing array of potentially game-changing applications for American business such as prototype </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Warvito/status/1570691960792580096?s=20&amp;t=myRuGf4EPaX2VzZ27RHXGA" rel="">synthetic brain scan images</a><span> that can drive medical research, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/StrangeNative/status/1569700294673702912?s=20&amp;t=j9kOfdRuyDIdQn7EDO23EQ" rel="">on demand interior design</a><span>, incredibly powerful</span><a href="https://twitter.com/LighthiserScott/status/1567355079228887041?s=20&amp;t=cBH4EGPC4r0Earm-mDbOKA" rel=""> Hollywood style film effects</a><span>, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/replicatehq/status/1568288903177859072?s=20&amp;t=sRd3HRehPMcj1QfcOwDMKg" rel="">seamless textures</a><span> for video games, new kinds of </span><a href="https://twitter.com/CoffeeVectors/status/1569416470332858372?s=20&amp;t=SVUdLj9P0qCgBYPO2JZJcQ" rel="">rapid animation</a><span> that can drive tremendous new streaming content, on-the-fly </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DieAntwoord/status/1570501797986570240?s=20&amp;t=2pXLq2yksFhAPshSMuz-PA" rel="">animated videos and books</a><span>,</span><a href="https://twitter.com/abubu_newnanka/status/1568955887972384769?s=20&amp;t=J_lCg0tiu-X-lRvThF-SWA" rel=""> concept art</a><span>, plugins for </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RemitNotPaucity/status/1562319004563173376?s=20&amp;t=eCqEaeHliJ-JKyn1q3cNow" rel="">Figma</a><span> and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cantrell/status/1582086537163919360?s=20&amp;t=eCqEaeHliJ-JKyn1q3cNow" rel="">Photoshop</a><span>, and much more. Openness works because no single company or person can imagine all the possible ways to use a brilliant new technology. </span></p><p>Others worry that we plan to neuter the models to the point of uselessness and try to chase every edge case.  We understand that it&#39;s impossible to solve for every edge case but we don&#39;t need to do that.  What we do need to do is listen to society as a whole, listen to regulators, listen to the community. </p><p>We are forming an open source committee to decide on major issues like cleaning data, NSFW policies and formal guidelines for model release.  This framework has a long history in open source and it&#39;s worked tremendously well.  Open source AI needs to be guided by the same democratic principles. We also announced a prize of $200,000 for deep fake detection and we will release that software open source and free of charge to help society combat this abuse of machine learning.</p><p>So when Stability AI says we have to slow down just a little it&#39;s because if we don&#39;t deal with very reasonable feedback from society and our own communities then there is a chance open source AI simply won&#39;t exist and nobody will be able to release powerful models. That&#39;s not a world we want to live in.</p><p>We believe in open source AI. Help us set the groundwork to make sure we have a firm foundation to build on, so we and everyone else can release models that matter now and in the future.</p><p>Help us make AI truly open, rather than open in name only.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
