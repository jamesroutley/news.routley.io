<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Some thoughts from my mid-batch reflection:
<ul>
<li>I’m proud of <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.itch.io/croissant-maker">Croissant Maker</a>, my first published game on itch.io from <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/day-16-croissant-maker/">my first ever game jam</a>, and I’m proud of <a href="https://github.com/jamiepalatnik/slow-art-online">Slow Art Online</a>, my first full-stack app (still a work in progress).</li>



<li>I wish I could have joined more of the social events, like visits to <a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/">Wonderville</a>, but I also feel pressure to be home with my kids in the evening. Maybe going forward I can try to make it to events that are calling me, at least every once in a while.</li>



<li>It’s been so cool to join the RC community and I’m learning so much from everyone here. I am also learning to be bold in the projects I’m working on and go for the things I really want, not waiting until I’m “ready.” I’m finding that I learn so much in the doing.</li>
