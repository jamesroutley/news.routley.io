<p>In Ukraine suicide drones strike critical infrastructure regularly.</p>

<p>General necessities such as water pumps in apartment buildings, elevators and corridor lights are sometimes backed up if people voted to spend money on a local generator in the building.</p>
<p>People backup necessities inside their apartments with power stations (Bluetti and Ecoflow being most popular).</p>
<h3 id="our-case">Our case</h3>
<p>We need to power up x1 hp proliant dl380p g8; x1 hp proliant dl360p g8; x20 google pixel 6.</p>
<p>Next came the question of which battery/solution to buy.</p>
<p>So we decided to build our own battery solution. Spoiler - it cost us $600 and it has better specs than $2300 Ecoflow.</p>
<p>For building your own gear you have to buy individual components like battery cells, protection board for them, inverter to 220V AC, charger, etc and assemble/connect it yourself.</p>
<p>Next thing you need is some way to convert 12V DC battery voltage to 230V AC mains voltage to power common devices like servers.</p>
<p>At this point there’re only a few items left to buy, like power cables for the battery and various consumables, and we can begin the assembly of the whole setup.</p>

After that I’ve slapped it together on the table to test that everything works before final installation, also to stress-test it under max load to check if connections don’t heat up.<br/>

Discovered that BMS’s short circuit protection was falsely triggered under medium-high load, adjusted it in the settings. And that I forgot to tighten one of the connections, it was heating up.</p>
<p>Because our main activity is running a phone farm, we have some spare phones, so one of them was sacrificed as a Bluetooth terminal to show battery’s stats:)</p>
<p>And just like that, the backup battery had its trial by fire just four hours in.</p>
<h3 id="our-startup">Our startup</h3>
<p>We now continue to work as before, getting social media engagement for us and our clients, applying to YC 2026 and other VCs.</p>
<p>We have a total of 60 Google Pixels across 3 locations in Kyiv.</p>
