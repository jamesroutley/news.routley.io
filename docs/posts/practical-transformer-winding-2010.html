    <h1>Practical Transformer Winding (2010)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p><img height="439" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/10kready.jpg" width="450"/>In the good old times it was a matter of fact that 
every electronic hobbyist or technician would wind himself any power 
transformers he needed, and rewind any that burned out. Unfortunately, nowadays 
transformer winding is fast becoming a lost art, and I have seen many people 
despair about where to find some very specific transformer, or pull their hair 
out about the cost of having one professionally wound to specifications.</p>
<p>Since I started in electronics, as a 12 year old boy, I have always wound my 
own transformers. I started using the basic, but useful instructions provided in 
The Radio Amateur&#39;s Handbook of the time, and later I came to better understand 
how transformers work, which enabled me to optimize a given transformer for 
the intended application. </p>
<p>Following a request by many readers of my web site, I&#39;ve added this page, which is 
complementary to the previously published <em><a href="https://ludens.cl/Electron/Magnet.html">Transformers and coils</a></em>. You should first read 
(and understand!) that page, before trying to design any transformer. Then 
come to this more practically-oriented page, to learn some tricks and hints 
about the design process, and about hands-on winding.</p>
<p>This page addresses mainly single-phase power transformers in the power range 
from about 1 watt to 10,000 watts, operating at line frequencies, but much of 
what&#39;s described here can be applied to a wide range of other transformers 
too.<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="278" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/material.jpg" width="450"/>Let&#39;s start with the materials. To make a typical transformer, you need 
the iron laminations for the core, enameled copper wire of several different 
diameters for the windings, a bobbin (or some material to make one), insulating 
material to apply between wire layers, between windings, around 
the whole winding assembly, and on exposed wires, and in most cases 
it&#39;s also a good idea to use an impregnation varnish. </p>
<p>The photo here shows several stacks of iron E-I laminations, two coils of 
wire (with cardboard protecting the wire from damage), one roll of thick, stiff 
Pressspan, another roll of NMN laminate (we will soon see what that is), two 
small bundles of spaghetti for wire protection, and a can of transformer 
varnish. Add to this some glue, cotton straps, ropes, adhesive tape, terminals, 
bolts, angle iron, and other small material, and that&#39;s it.</p>
<p>All these materials are sold by companies specializing in transformers and 
parts for transformers. Enameled wire is also sold by many other distributors, 
but is usually cheapest at the places that sell it together with the other 
materials. You will have to dig into the phone book or some other directory to 
find these companies, since they don&#39;t usually have a shiny nice store in the 
downtown shopping mall!<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="338" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/laminaEI.jpg" width="450"/></p>
<p>Transformer iron is an alloy of iron with silicon and some other minor components. It&#39;s 
characterized by a relatively high permeability, very high saturation flux 
density, relatively low hysteresis loss, and relatively high specific resistance. 
This latter factor, along with the practice of using the material in 
thin, insulated sheets, reduces the power losses produced by eddy currents.</p>
<p>The most common shape of these sheets is shown at right. 
It&#39;s the classic &#34;economy E-I&#34; shape. Why it&#39;s called E-I should be pretty 
obvious when looking at the photo! But the explanation for &#34;economy&#34; might be a 
bit more elusive: It&#39;s because at the exact proportions shown in the photo, the 
I&#39;s are nothing else than the cutouts to make the windows in the E&#39;s, when two 
E&#39;s are cut facing each other! This allows stamping E&#39;s and I&#39;s out of a large 
steel sheet, without any wasting of material, except for the little round bits 
cut out of the bolt holes. By the way, small laminations often don&#39;t have such 
bolt holes, and such cores are held together by clamps instead of bolts, or even 
welded.</p>
<p>The lamination in the photo is a large one, as the 
comparison with my hand shows. It&#39;s an E80 (the center leg is 80mm 
wide), typically used for transformers in the 3 to 10 kilowatt range! </p>
<p>In any E-I lamination you are likely to encounter, the 
center leg is twice as wide as each of the other parts. This is because the 
entire magnetic flux has to go through the center leg, but then splits up, 
with one half of the flux returning through each of the side legs. If you 
ever come across a lamination that has all three legs of the same width, 
then you are looking at a lamination intended for three phase 
transformers! </p>
<p>Such an economy E-I lamination like shown here has 
completely fixed proportions, beyond the rule above, that stem from the need to 
cut the I out of the winding window of two E&#39;s facing each other: If the center 
leg is 2 units wide, then the window is 1 x 3 units, the total E is 6 x 4 units, 
the I is 1 x 6 units, and so on.<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="349" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/arglam.jpg" width="450"/></p>
<p>Not all laminations follow the 
&#34;economy&#34; proportions, though. Here is an example of a lamination that 
comes in one piece, instead of being divided into an E and an I, and that has 
the windows proportionally much larger than the E-I lamination shown above. Such 
a lamination is a bit more expensive to make, because the steel cut from the 
windows is wasted, unless the manufacturer can find some other use for it. 
But being able to accomodate a much large winding assembly, it has some 
advantages in certain cases. </p>
<p>These &#34;non-economy&#34; laminations were quite usual in 
Europe, many years ago, but nowadays copper is so much more expensive than 
steel, that transformers are usually designed to use more steel and less copper. 
And for that goal, the economy lamination is very well suited. So you won&#39;t very 
often come across a lamination like this, unless you are restoring antique 
equipment.<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="313" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/varnishing.jpg" width="450"/></p>
<p>The laminations should be thin, and reasonably well 
insulated from each other, to reduce eddy currents to an insignificant value. 
Typical thicknesses vary from 0.2 to 0.5mm, but higher frequency transformers 
(audio) use much thinner ones, while extremely large transformers might use 
slightly thicker ones.</p>
<p>The insulation is often applied at the factory that 
makes the big rolls of steel sheet, even before stamping the E&#39;s and I&#39;s. 
Different kinds of insulation are used: A thin oxide layer, a thin layer of 
enamel, or any of several chemical processes. Antique transformers 
sometimes even used very thin paper! </p>
<p>When I was young, patient and overly eager to do 
things right, I painted each and every E and I for my transformers, using 
diluted transformer varnish, to make a thin, nice layer. The photo shows the 
steel for a 200 watt transformer, drying. Later, getting old and lazy, I noticed 
that the layer of rust on old, recycled laminations is more than enough 
insulation, and that the very thin and imperfect insulation that comes on new 
laminations is enough too, even if it takes only a light scratch with the 
multimeter&#39;s test probe to puncture it and get through to the steel. We don&#39;t 
need perfect insulation between the sheets! We only need enough resistance to 
reduce eddy currents to a low level.</p>
<p> Transformer steel is not all born alike. 
Manufacturers will provide data sheets about their products (often on their 
web sites), where you can see what they offer. There are usually many grades, 
with vastly different loss characteristics. At a given flux density and 
frequency, a good material might have ten times less loss than a cheap material! 
So it pays to look, investigate, and decide intelligently what to buy. 
Thinner sheets normally have lower loss, and the rest of the secret lies in the 
exact alloy. In any case, you need to know what material you have, to be 
able to make a meaningful transformer design!</p>
<p>Some transformer steel is grain-oriented. That 
means that when rolling the steel sheets, a process is used to align the 
crystalline grains in the direction of the rolling. This kind of material has 
particularly good behavior when the magnetic flux is aligned with the 
direction in which the sheet was rolled, but is worse than standard 
material in the perpendicular direction. Such grain-oriented material is ideal 
for toroidal cores, which are made by coiling up a long strip of steel, but is 
not a large improvement for E-I laminations, because in these a significant 
portion of the material has to work with the flux perpendicular to the rolling 
direction.<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="338" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/wires2.jpg" width="450"/></p>
<p>Enamelled copper wire comes in many different diameters, 
and with several different kinds of enamel. The diameters vary from less 
than that of a hair, to about that of a child&#39;s finger. Different standards 
exist for the wire diameter. A very common one is <em>American Wire Gauge,</em> shortened to AWG, which is 
used in much of the world. Britain has its own standard, and in many countries 
the wire is specified simply by its diameter in millimeters. </p>
<p>Thick wires usually are coated with a sort of enamel 
that is very tough, an excellent insulator, highly heat-resistant, highly 
resistant to solvents, and that clings to copper even better than dirt does to 
children! This enamel is usually yellowish clear, so that the wire coated in it 
looks mostly copper-colored, but many exceptions exist. To solder the ends of 
these wires, it&#39;s necessary to scrape off the enamel, using a sharp knife 
or similar tool. This procedure would be too difficult with a thin, fragile 
wire, so that these thin wires are instead covered with an enamel that 
has most of the same characteristics of the other one, except the heat 
resistance: It will melt and turn into solder flux at a temperature a common 
soldering iron easily achieves! This allows easily soldering these wires, 
without previously stripping them. But transformers using this latter kind of 
wire enamel cannot survive temperatures as high as those using only the former 
kind of wire enamel. The red wire on the right side in this photo has this kind 
of enamel. But be careful with colors! The clear wire on the extreme left 
side also has solderable enamel, while the dark violet one in the middle is 
of the non-melting variety! </p>
<p>The thickness of the enamel layer depends on the wire 
thickness, the manufacturer, and can sometimes be chosen: Some manufacturers 
will offer the wire with seeral different thicknesses of enamel. In any case, 
the diameter specified by a certain AWG number refers to the copper diameter, so 
that the complete wire, with enamel, will be slightly thicker than what the AWG 
standard tells!<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="318" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/wires.jpg" width="450"/>Here is a <a href="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/WireTable.txt">wire table for AWG wire</a>. It shows the AWG 
number, the diameter in millimeters excluding the enamel, the approximate 
typical total diameter including the enamel (but this varies somewhat), the 
cross sectional copper area in square millimeters, the area of the square of 
window space occupied by that wire in a transformer (including the enamel, of 
course), the current carrying capacity at a typical, average value of current 
density, the resistance in ohms per meter, and finally how many meters of that 
wire come in one kilogram, because enamelled wire is usually bought by 
weight, not length.</p>
<p>This table has wires from AWG #1 to #40, and for the 
thickest ones I didn&#39;t calculate all data. But you should be aware that there 
are wires exceeding this range! The thinnest I have ever used was #46. It breaks 
when you blow at it! The photo here shows a #39 wire lying on a #7 wire. The 
hairy thing below is my floor carpet. Note that even this #39 wire is not much 
thicker than the hairs of this carpet!</p>
<p>It&#39;s interesting to note that every three AWG numbers, 
the cross sectional area exactly doubles. Any deviation from this in my table is 
due to approximation errors.<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="281" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/bobbins.jpg" width="450"/></p>
<p>Modern transformers of small to moderate size are 
usually wound on plastic bobbins. Here you can see simple ones. Some bobbins 
have pins or terminals molded into them, others have one or two divisions. Some 
don&#39;t have the slits for terminals, which the ones shown here do have.</p>
<p>Typically for a given size of E-I laminations, bobbins 
will be available in two or three sizes, accomodating different numbers of steel 
sheets. So you can vary the amount of steel in your transformer not only by 
choosing the lamination size, but also the height of the lamination stack!<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="338" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/splitbobbin.jpg" width="450"/></p>
<p>Here is a little transformer using a divided (or 
split) bobbin. This is very practical, because it completely separates the 
primary from the secondary winding, making it much easier to achieve the degree 
of insulation required for safety. More about that later.<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="323" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/bobbin1.jpg" width="450"/></p>
<p>If you cannot find a plastic bobbin in the proper size, 
don&#39;t despair! Bobbins can be easily made from materials such as strong 
cardboard, or Pressspan, which is nothing else than a particularly strong 
cardboard.</p>
<p>The bobbin shown here was made from 1.5mm thick 
Pressspan, which is really too thick for this small bobbin, but I had nothing 
better on hand. The pieces are cut to size using a sharp knife (X-acto or the 
like), and glued together with cyanoacrylate adhesive (instant bonder). The 
clever structural design of this super high tech bobbin holds it together 
perfectly while the glue sets!</p>
<p>You must make the inner dimensions of the bobbin core a 
tad larger than the transformer center leg, but JUST a tad, no more, unless you 
want to waste valuable winding space! The sides can be made pretty tight to the 
size of the laminations, because if they don&#39;t fit at the end, they are 
easily enough cut or filed down, even after the winding has been made. But 
the length of the bobbin must be smaller than the window length of the core, by 
as much as 2 or 3%, plus any tolerances of your manufacture! Because it is 
critically important that the E&#39;s and I&#39;s can touch each other properly, 
without being kept separated by a bobbin that deformed during winding, and 
grew!<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="405" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/bobbin2.jpg" width="450"/> 
Be sure to at least break the corners as shown here, or even better, round them 
off. Otherwise the wire is guaranteed to tangle at the sharp corners during 
winding, and a wire loop sticking out of the completed winding can ruin the 
whole thing!</p>
<p>Note that the junction of the bobbin&#39;s center piece is 
placed in the middle of one side, and not in a corner. It&#39;s next to impossible 
to produce a reasonably symmetrical and precise bobbin when placing the junction 
in a corner.</p>
<p>If the material is thin compared to the bobbin size, the 
junction should be made by overlapping the material. Of course, the overlapped 
junction is always placed on one side that will end up outside the core window, 
so that the added bulk has little detrimental effect.</p>
<p>To bend this thick material in reasonably clean right 
angles, my technique is to use a sharp knife to cut out a 90 degree wedge from 
the inside, along each bend line, leaving only the outer third of the material 
intact.  After that admittedly cruel treatment, the Pressspan eagerly 
bends to my will.<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="489" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/argcoil.jpg" width="450"/></p>
<p>Most antique transformers, and many of the larger modern 
ones, don&#39;t use a real complete bobbin. Instead, they use only the center 
former, and no sides at all! It takes some tricks and practice to wind a 
transformer like this without having the whole thing come apart many times over 
during winding, but for people who have acquired enough practice, it&#39;s faster 
than making a real bobbin!</p>
<p>Further down, I will show you a trick to make this kind 
of transformer, with high quality.</p>
<p>Note in this photo how the Argentinian maker of this 
transformer (back in 1931!) used insulating material of several different 
thicknesses for the bobbin center, the interlayer insulation, the interwinding 
insulation, and the terminal support.</p>
<p>You might ask why any insulation material is required at 
all, if the wire is insulated by its enamel layer! Well, the enamel is very 
thin, and easily scratched. It might survive as much as a few thousand volts, 
but it might also break down with a lot less! It depends on type, condition, 
thickness, temperature, and other factors. So, wherever the voltage can exceed a 
few tens of volts, some additional insulation needs to be used. Specially 
between the primary and secondary, safety regulations ask for an insulation good 
for at least 4000 volts, to avoid electrocuting somebody when there is a 
lightning transient on the AC power network.</p>
<p>In antique transformers, the most usual insulating 
material was paper, impregnated with something like 
beeswax, tar or the like. This impregnation had several purposes: 
Mainly, it would seal the pores of the paper, making it a really good insulator, 
while without the impregnation it would only insulate as well as the same 
thickness of air! But in addition, it kept moisture out, it helped stick the 
thin wires in place during winding, and it improved the thermal conductivity of 
the completed winding assembly.</p>
<p>It was also quite sticky, dirty, messy and gross.</p>
<p>Modern insulating materials are far superior. Plastic 
sheets such as Mylar provide excellent dielectric strength and have no pores, so 
they require no impregnation to realize their high degree of insulation. 
Nomex instead, with its fibrous structure, behaves like paper, but both 
Nomex and Mylar are much better than paper at surviving high temperatures! This 
is a key characteristic of insulating materials: The temperature class. It&#39;s 
coded with a letter. Paper would have an A or B rating, telling that it is 
fine for temperatures not much above that of boiling water. Different plastic 
insulation materials instead are routinely available in classes as high as F, G 
or even H! They can safely run much hotter than paper can.<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="290" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/nmn.jpg" width="439"/>The 
photo shows an NMN insulating sheet. This is a sandwich of a Mylar sheet 
embedded between two layers of Nomex. The Nomex will eagerly soak up and 
distribute the impregnation varnish (or the oil, in an oil-inmersed 
transformer), while the Mylar will provide safe insulation even in places that 
for any reason stayed dry! I love this material. It&#39;s thermal class G, if I 
remember right.</p>
<p>Insulation materials come not only in many different 
variants, and temperature classes, but of course also in many different 
thicknesses. You choose the proper thickness so that it has enough dielectric 
strength and mechanical strength, without taking up an undue portion of your 
valuable window space!</p>
<p>Despite all modern materials, good old paper and 
cardboard is still used sometimes. Mostly in its form known by the German word 
Pressspan, which means &#34;compressed chips&#34;, and is simply a very dense paper 
or cardboard.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very good practice to soak a completed transformer 
in some impregnation varnish. It will form fillets around wires, papers, and 
anything else. It will improve the insulation, make the transformer highly 
moisture-proof, glue everything together so that nothing can rattle, come loose, 
or chafe through, it will improve thermal transfer, and so on. </p>
<p>Varnish comes in several thermal classes, just like the 
insulation material, and also it comes in variants that dry at high temperature, 
or at room temperature. My experience is that no varnish ever fully dries at 
room temperature, and when you start using the transformer and it warms up, the 
varnish inside will start drying, and stink! So, it&#39;s necessary to apply heat 
anyway, regardless of what sort of varnish you use.</p>
<hr/>


<p>Now that you have turned into a person very 
knowledgeable about transformer materials, let&#39;s turn to those pesky 
questions such as &#34;how many turns do I have to wind?&#34;  or &#34;what 
wire size?&#34; or &#34;how much power will I get?&#34;</p>
<p>There are three typical situations:</p>
<p>1. You need to repair/rewind a transformer that burned 
out.</p>
<p>2. Your want to rewind an existing transformer, to 
produce the voltages and currents you need, which are different from the 
original ones. A variation of this case is when you want a certain voltage, at 
the highest current that transformer can provide.</p>
<p>3. You have fixed specifications, want to design a 
transformer to optimally meet them, and you will buy the core and all other 
materials.<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="338" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/unwinding.jpg" width="450"/>Let&#39;s start with the first case. You MUST  
find out why that transformer failed! A correctly designed, correctly built and 
correctly used transformer is, for all practical ends, eternal. If it failed, 
there is a reason. If you know that the transformer was shorted, overloaded for 
a long while, exposed to intense lightning transients, thrown into water, gnawed 
through by rats, exposed to corrosive substances, or anything like that, then 
your best approach is to unwind it, count the turns, measure the wire sizes, and 
rewind it exactly as it was originally made.</p>
<p>The photo shows an antique speaker field coil, 
mounted in my winding machine. I unwind coils by pulling off the wire while 
having the thing spin in the machine, so that the turns counter in the machine 
will do the pesky job of keeping count. The problem, as illustrated here, is 
often that thin wires won&#39;t come off nicely! They are stuck in place, and will 
break, then entire chunks of wire will come off all together. This often makes 
it hard to accurately count the turns. </p>
<p>In such cases you might simply estimate how many turns 
you didn&#39;t count. Or you can collect all the pieces of wire you removed, weigh 
them, calculate the amount of wire from there, and calculate the turns number 
from it. Or, instead of unwinding the coil, cut it with a knife or better a 
Dremel tool, remove it in one block, measure the cross sectional area of the 
entire winding, then remove a little piece of wire to measure the diameter, and 
finally calculate the number of turns from this. Any of these methods will 
usually be precise enough for non-demanding applications, and none of it will be 
precise enough when you need anything critical.</p>
<p>By the way, do you know how to precisely measure the 
diameter of a thin wire, when you don&#39;t have a micrometer screw? Simple: You 
wind 10 or 20 or even more turns tightly on a former (such as a screwdriver 
stem), measure the length of the coil with a common ruler, then divide by 
the number of turns to get the wire diameter. It&#39;s highly accurate. Sometimes 
it&#39;s even better than using a micrometer screw, which can flatten the wire if 
you apply too much torque! </p>
<p>But there are cases when you have a burned transformer, 
and no good reason why it burned. It might have been a manufacturing defect, a 
huge transient, an overload that went undetected, but maybe - the Gods of 
Electromagnetics forbid - that transformer might have been misdesigned! In that 
case, painstakingly rewinding it with the same wire gauges and turn numbers 
as original, will only produce a transformer that will fail again. So, if 
you don&#39;t know why a transformer failed, re-do the design, and compare your 
results with what the manufacturer did! Many manufacturers are cheapskates, and 
use substandard transformers, in the hope that most clients will never use them 
intensively enough to blow them up! This sends you straight to the section about 
the third case, further down this page!</p>
<p>In the second case, when you want to rewind an existing 
transformer for new output values, very often the transformer will already have 
a properly wound and healthy primary winding. In such a case, keep it! There is 
no point in unwinding and rewinding the primary, if it is fine. The calculation 
work for such  a transformer is quite simple: Before taking it apart, 
measure the voltage delivered by the secondary. Disassemble it, unwind the 
secondary, counting the turns, and calculate the number of turns per volt from 
this. Calculate the new number of turns you need for your desired voltage. 
Calculate what&#39;s the largest wire size that will comfortably fit in the 
available space. Get the wire, wind it, and assemble the transformer. The power 
rating will be the same as before, and this allows you to calculate the current 
you can safely draw, at your new voltage.</p>
<p>And if you also want a new primary, well, do the same as 
above, but unwind and re-wind all windings, according to the value of turns per 
volt you found out!<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="468" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/wig.jpg" width="450"/> </p>
<p>Do you know what you can do with all that wire you 
remove from old transformers? Well, a super trendy wig, like the one shown here, 
modelled by my sister, is sure to catch everybody&#39;s attention! Otherwise, 
there isn&#39;t really much use for such wire. It comes out totally kinked, 
stretched, broken, scraped, with varnish, wax or tar sticking to it. Don&#39;t even 
dream about ever re-using it in any other transformer!</p>
<p>OK, now it&#39;s time to really start designing a 
transformer. Because this is what you have to do in case 3, which is essentially 
creating a transformer from scratch. I hope you are still fresh and aware of 
everything you learned in <a href="https://ludens.cl/Electron/Magnet.html">Transformers and coils</a>, because you will need 
it here to understand what&#39;s going on.</p>
<p>The design process starts with guessing the size of core 
you need, for the power you want. If you are experienced in electronics, you 
will be able to make a reasonably close first guess. Otherwise, use the data 
given by core manufacturers to get this first guess.</p>
<p>The core chosen will have a certain cross sectional 
area, and will have a certain window area. The two multiplied are the &#34;area 
product&#34;, which can be related to the approximate power capability, with a 
reasonably simple, but nonlinear curve. This curve also depends on the quality 
of the core material, and several other factors.</p>
<p>The next step is calculating how many turns per volt you 
need on this core. To this end, you have to decide how much flux density you 
will put through your core, and then you can apply the equations from <a href="https://ludens.cl/Electron/Magnet.html">Transformers and coils</a>. The optimal flux 
density might be anything from 0.8 to 1.6 Tesla, and sometimes even outside this 
range! General rules of thumb are these:</p>
<p>- Larger transformers use lower flux densities.</p>
<p>- Better core material uses higher flux densities.</p>
<p>- Transformers that are always energized, but rarely 
used at full power, use lower flux densities.</p>
<p>- Likewise, transformers that work at full power 
whenever energized, use very high flux density.</p>
<p>- Forced air cooled transformers use higher flux 
density.</p>
<p>- Oil-immersed transformers use even higher flux 
density!</p>
<p>- Higher flux density produces better voltage 
regulation.</p>
<p>- Lower flux density produces less base loss.</p>
<p>- Lower flux density is less likely to produce humming 
noise, and magnetic stray fields.</p>
<p>- Lower flux density produces lower iron loss, but 
higher copper loss.</p>

<p>I have seen many text books giving design equations that 
result in a flux density of 1 Tesla in each and every transformer you 
calculate by them, like if that were a sacred rule! If you come across any such 
book, BURN IT! It&#39;s nonsense! While 1 Tesla indeed tends to produce a workable 
transformer in most cases, in at least 70% of all situations it&#39;s far 
enough from the optimal value to warrant some effort toward optimization! 
Specially in small transformers, and in those using the better core 
materials.</p>
<p>So, I suggest to start with a value chosen from the 
rules above, and then calculate the transformer based on this value, analyzing 
the losses, heating, voltage drop, efficiency, and so on. Then change the flux 
density, by 10 or 20%, and re-do all the calculations. You will see what I mean! 
There is a clear optimum value for flux density in each particular case, and 
this value is very often sufficiently removed from 1 Tesla to make you wonder 
why some book authors still copy that &#34;magic number&#34; from other, long gone 
authors! Most likely they have no idea about the matter they are copying.</p>
<p>That said, sometimes I do wind my transformers for 1 
Tesla, because there are cases when this is really a good value!</p>
<p>The loss calculation isn&#39;t very hard: The manufacturers 
of transformer steel specify the loss of their products, as a certain 
amount of watts per unit of volume or weight, under certain conditions of 
frequency and flux density. And the better of these data sheets also 
contain curves, or give equations, to calculate the loss under different 
conditions. That&#39;s about the iron loss. The total loss of the transformer also 
includes the copper loss, which is caused simply by the current flowing through 
the resistance of the wire. For a given flux density you get a certain number of 
turns per volt, this allows you to calculate the total turns in each winding. 
Dividing the available window cross section between these wires, insulation, 
bobbin, and inevitably wasted space, you get the wire cross sections. From the 
dimensions of the core, you can then calculate the total wire length, from this 
and the cross sections you calculate the resistances of the windings, and from 
that and the currents you calculate the power loss. It&#39;s easy!<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><a href="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/transformers.xls"><img height="338" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/trafoSheet.png" width="450"/></a>What? You are banging your head against the 
wall?  Come on! Don&#39;t cry! I have prepared an Excel sheet for you, which 
takes care of these calculations! It&#39;s really too time consuming to do all this 
math step by step, every time. Click on the screenshot at right to get the Excel 
file, and then play with it as you continue reading.</p>
<p>In this sheet, you enter your data in the green area, 
and watch what happens in the orange one. The first three values you have to 
enter are the ones that specify the core. First is the center leg width of the 
lamination used, in millimeters. The 100mm width given in the example is a 
pretty large lamination. You will typically use values between 12 and 50mm. The 
sheet is based on the proportions of the economy E-I core, so that you don&#39;t 
need to enter any other dimensions of the lamination. If you happen to be using 
a lamination that has different proportions than the economy E-I, 
you should still enter the width of the center leg, but later you will need to 
manually compensate for the larger available window, by increasing wire size 
beyond that calculated by the sheet, reducing the copper loss, and so on.</p>
<p>The second value you have to enter about the core is the 
stack height, also expressed in millimeters. This is simply the height of the 
stack of E&#39;s, well compressed. This sheet does not allow you to enter the 
stacking factor, which tells how much of the stack is actually steel. There&#39;s 
always some little space used by insulation, and even wasted space due to 
imperfect compression. But the effect of this is small enough to ignore, as long 
as you compress the stack well enough!</p>
<p>Good stack heights to use are from the same as the 
center leg width, to close to twice that. Often you have the choice to use a 
certain lamination, stacked as high as the center leg is wide, or use the next 
smaller lamination, stacked much higher, with both options producing the same 
output. It pays to simulate both options, optimize each, and compare the 
efficiency, voltage drop, weight, and cost! The differences can be profound.</p>
<p>And the third value is the loss factor of the steel 
material. This must be taken from the datasheet provided by the manufacturer of 
the lamination. My sheet expects this loss factor to be expressed in watts 
per kilogram of material, at a flux density of 1 tesla and a frequency of 50 
hertz. Many data sheets include the value in this exact form, but those 
published by US companies might instead express the loss factor in an eclectic 
mixture of metric, CGS and Imperial units! If that&#39;s what you have, you will 
need to convert the value into its fully metric equivalent. You might want to 
modify the spreadsheet to do that.</p>
<p>The value of 2 W/kg @ 1T and 50Hz is pretty 
representative for modern low cost laminations. A modern ultra low loss material 
might be a lot better, while an antique or ultra-cheap material might 
be significantly worse.</p>
<p>The next three values in that column are pretty obvious: 
You have to indicate the primary and secondary voltages, and the frequency of 
operation. The secondary voltage refers to the open circuit (no load) voltage. 
And the frequency will usually be either 50 or 60 Hertz. If you enter a 
frequency far away from this, it&#39;s quite possible that the loss calculated for 
the material will be rather imprecise, so use this sheet with caution if you 
need to design a transformer for a very different frequency.</p>
<p>In the right hand column, you have four values which are 
design decisions which you can vary somewhat. The first is the all-important 
flux density. Just try varying that value, and watch how things change in the 
orange output area! Specially, see what happens with the iron loss. I have 
already given guidelines about what flux density to use. Use them and see what 
happens in your case, when you change it.</p>
<p>The next is the amount of copper cross section you will 
allow for each ampere of current in the windings. Reasonable values are about 
0.25 mm^2/A for very small transformers, increasing to 0.5 for large ones. 
0.35 is typical for medium sized transformers (50 to 300 watts or so). When you 
adjust this value, the design of the transformer doesn&#39;t really change, but the 
sheet will calculate a new set of currents, power, voltage drop, 
efficiency and loss. With this parameter, you basically are telling the sheet 
how much you will stress a particular transformer.</p>
<p>The fill factor expresses how much of the lamination&#39;s 
window will actually be filled with copper. It can never be very high, because a 
lot of that area gets inevitably filled out with the bobbin, the wire&#39;s lacquer, 
the air around the round wire, the insulation between layers, between windings, 
and some space is always lost due to sloppy winding, even if you are careful! 
The value of 0.4 used in this example has proven in practice to be achievable 
without much trouble. If you wind very carefully, and minimize the amount 
of space devoted to insulation, you should be able to get up to 0.5. But 
don&#39;t push this number too much, or you will end up with a transformer design 
that you cannot actually wind! On the contrary, if you have never before wound a 
transformer, and will do so by hand, in a ragged, ugly winding, it might be a 
good idea to design the transformer with an even lower fill factor, such as 0.3, 
to make sure you will be able to fit all the turns! Of course, using a lower 
fill factor means simply using thinner wire, and this means that at a given 
amount of loss and heating, you get less current.</p>
<p>The fill factor can be pushed beyond 0.5 when you wind a 
transformer with square wire (instead of round), or with copper tape separated 
by thin layers of insulation. But square wire is hard to find and a hassle to 
wind properly, and tape winding is acceptably easy only for transformers that 
have rather few turns. This is often the case with high frequency transformers 
used in switching power supplies, but not at line frequencies.</p>
<p>The temperature rise defines how many Kelvins (same as 
degrees Celsius in this case) hotter than the surrounding air and objects you 
want your transformer to run. You need to carefully choose this value, according 
to the highest ambient temperature (inside the equipment!) at which your 
transformer will have to work, also taking into account the highest temperature 
your wire, insulation material, varnish, glue, etc, can survive. And what&#39;s most 
difficult, you will also need to estimate the thermal gradient from the 
innermost wire turns (the hottest ones) to the transformer&#39;s surface! 
Calculating all this can be quite hard, and I can&#39;t give you simplified 
equations for it. Maybe you can find them elsewhere. The value of 
70 Kelvins which I used in the example design is relatively high. This is 
so because this transformer would work in open air, not inside a housing, where 
the ambient temperature is never above 25 degrees Celsius; also, I used class G 
or higher insulating material, wire and varnish throughout; and finally, 
this transformer was carefully impregnated with varnish, giving it a reasonably 
good thermal conductivity between winding layers.</p>
<p>If your transformer will not be impregnated, or use 
class A or B insulation material (paper), or run inside a cabinet that can be 
hot, then you will need to use a lower value for allowed temperature rise 
then my 70 Kelvins!</p>
<p>Finally, you can enter your local and current prices for 
enameled copper wire and transformer steel laminations, to have the sheet 
calculate the cost of these main materials for your transformer. All the 
additional cost, for the bobbin, insulation material, terminals, bolts and so 
on, is usually small compared to the copper and steel cost. The most expensive 
item is usually the wire, by far.</p>
<p>The first two lines of the orange output area of my 
spreadsheet show some basic results for that transformer: The cross sectional 
area of the magnetic core and of the winding window, also the total copper area 
(after applying the fill factor), the turns per volt constant that will be 
valid for all windings on this transformer, and the average length of one turn, 
which is calculated as the average between the length of a wire that goes around 
the center leg touching it, and one that goes around the entire winding package, 
touching the outer legs.</p>
<p>Then you have a line for the primary winding and one for 
the secondary. Each of these lines tells you the number of turns, the length of 
the wire need to wind it, the copper cross sectional area of the wire, and the 
nominal current that will flow at full rating. The number of turns isn&#39;t rounded 
off, so you will have to do that, because you can&#39;t wind a fraction of a turn. 
You can fiddle with your voltage data to get the sheet to show round numbers of 
turns. The wire length is based on the length of the average turn, so this will 
be correct only if you wind the primary and secondary side-by-side, on a split 
bobbin. If instead you wind the secondary on top of the primary, you will 
need less wire than calculated for the primary, and more than calculated for the 
secondary. Anyway, these lengths are not very useful in practice, because wire 
is bought by weight, not length. The main situation where they are useful is 
when you have to wind a transformer with several thin wires in parallel, because 
these are much easier to bend than one thick wire. In such a situation, it&#39;s 
great to know how long the total winding is, so that you can cut the 
strands and twist them together, before you start winding.</p>
<p>The remainder of the orange output area is divided into 
two columns. The left one shows some important performance data of the 
transformer: There is the input power, expressed in voltamperes, which is really 
more correct than watts. The value calculated by the sheet does not include the 
magnetizing current; Calculating it would need additional information about the 
core. But in medium to larger transformers, at least, the magnetizing current 
tends to be small enough to be ignored.</p>
<p>Then comes the percentual power loss of the transformer, 
at full load. This includes both the iron loss and copper loss. The output power 
is of course the input power minus this loss.</p>
<p>Then we can see the voltage drop at full load. The value 
is calculated only from the resistances of the windings. Any additional loss 
caused by imperfect coupling between the windings is not considered here. So, if 
you use a poor core or winding technique, that results in bad coupling, you 
should expect a somewhat higher voltage drop. Just for user convenience, the 
sheet also calculates the output voltage under full load, which is based on the 
voltage drop calculated above.</p>
<p>Below comes the weight of iron laminations and copper 
wire used in the transformer. This has several purposes. One is knowing how 
heavy the beast will be, of course. The other is knowing how much material you 
have to buy! If you use side-by-side winding of the primary and secondary, you 
need to buy one half the calculated copper wire of each size (plus some extra, 
of course, to be on the safe side). If instead you wind the secondary over the 
primary, you need a little less than half of that weight of the primary wire, 
and a little more than half that weight of the secondary.</p>
<p>And then, the sheet will calculate the total cost for 
laminations and wire, and also divide this by the power, to give the cost per 
watt for your transformer, which is a good figure of merit which you might want 
to optimize. Even while this calculation doesn&#39;t include the cost for insulating 
material and other odds and ends, it&#39;s still a good reference.</p>
<p>The right side column of this area is about thermal 
matters. These tell whether your transformer will survive, so don&#39;t take 
them lightly!  The sheet calculates the power loss in the 
iron, in the copper, and adds them to get the total power loss. Copper loss 
is calculated at ambient temperature, though. When the wire heats up, its 
resistance increases, and so its loss increases too! For this reason, take the 
calculated value with a small grain of salt. The same is true for the voltage 
drop end efficiency calculations!</p>
<p>You need to be aware of the fact that the iron loss is 
essentially constant, regardless of the load placed on the transformer, except 
for a little effect caused by voltage drop in the windings reducing 
available magnetizing voltage, which causes a slight <strong>decrease</strong> in core loss when the load gets 
<strong>higher</strong> !  The loss in the wire 
instead increases with the square of the current taken from the transformer, and 
the value calculated by the sheet is for the full rated current.</p>
<p>This gives you some big help in optimizing a transformer 
design. For example, a transformer that will spend lots of time plugged in, but 
idling or loafing along at low load, will see very little copper loss, but the 
iron loss will be there all the time. So, you should design that transformer 
with a relatively low flux density, resulting in low core loss, accepting a 
higher copper loss instead, by setting a smaller value of copper cross section 
per ampere. After all, most of the time the rated design current won&#39;t be 
present, so that the very high copper loss resulting in the calculation will be 
present only very rarely, for short times! Transformers used in radio 
communication equipment, in audio amplifiers, and many other uses, are best 
designed in this way.</p>
<p>The opposite case happens with transformers that are 
energized only briefly, but run at full output power whenever energized. 
Examples of such use are microwave ovens and spot welders.  In such a 
transformer, iron loss always happens at the same time as copper loss, and you 
can optimize the transformer to get the lowest total loss, regardless of how it 
distributes between the iron and the copper. Even more, you might intentionally 
place more loss into the core than the windings, based on the fact that the core 
is less prone to be damaged by heat, has more thermal mass, and that the 
short operation time won&#39;t allow the peak heat to distribute through the 
transformer! And then, such a transformer that operates only for short times can 
be designed to have a really huge loss, because it will have time to cool 
off between uses! These things are what makes microwave oven transformers that 
deliver 800 watts be as small as a 200 watt transformer intended for 
continuous service at low rate, and run at a flux density of 2 teslas or 
even more!</p>
<p>The heat produced by a transformer has to be dissipated 
to the surrounding air. The spreadsheet calculates the approximate total surface 
area of the transformer, and finally calculates a required thermal transfer 
coefficient, which expresses how much power the transformer needs to dissipate 
per unit of surface it has, and per temperature rise allowed. This coefficient 
tells you how difficult it will be to keep this transformer cool enough to 
survive! The violet area below this coefficient includes referential values (not 
calculated by the sheet) which you can use to try judging whether your 
transformer will be OK, when you have it in a tight area, in a more open area, 
cooled by a fan, or immersed in oil. I have my doubts about these values, 
specially aout the value for the oil-immersed transformer, so please take 
these with a big grain of salt, and let me know if you have any further, better, 
or more reliable data.</p>
<p>Anyway, my transformers designed for a coefficient of 
around 12 have all survived so far, even while getting quite hot at full load, 
so this value can&#39;t be too far from the truth.</p>
<hr/>

<p>A typical design sequence using this spreadsheet would 
be to first enter the tentative core size and loss, the required voltages and 
frequency, then start with something like 1 tesla and 0.35mm^2/A, leaving the 
fill factor at 0.4 and setting the temperature rise according to your 
transformer&#39;s materials and environment. Then you can observe the power and 
current it would operate at, and the losses, efficiency, voltage drop, and 
also you would get the thermal transfer coefficient which you can compare to the 
table to gain an idea of whether the transformer will survive. You can then 
tweak the flux density and current density, trying to get the 
characteristics into the range you need, without exceeding the thermal 
possibilities. If you just can&#39;t find a combination that provides what you need, 
you will have to try with a larger (or lower loss) core. Then you might want to 
explore several different core sizes, optimizing each, and watch the cost, 
finally settling for the design that best provides what you need, at the lowest 
possible cost, while staying in the survivable thermal range.</p>
<p>This work with the spreadsheet is only the first step, 
though. When you have arrived at a good design using the sheet, you need to 
tweak it to make it buildable with real, available material! For example, you 
cannot get wire in any desired diameter. The sheet doesn&#39;t know that; It might 
ask you for a wire measuring 1.2345 square millimeters, or anything else. It&#39;s 
<strong>your</strong> job to see what wire you can 
actually buy, or maybe what wire you happen to have in stock, and adapt the 
design. The AWG standard is quite finely stepped, so you don&#39;t need to change 
the design very much to adapt it to standard AWG sizes. But I have heard that in 
the US many stores only sell the even numbered AWG sizes of wire! That&#39;s odd 
(pardon the pun), since even down here in less developed Chile I can easily buy 
all AWG sizes, even and odd.  If you are limited to even sizes only, 
you will have to make bigger compromises.</p>
<p>A good approximation technique is to round the wire 
size to the nearest AWG size, or if the values calculated fall just in the 
middle between AWG sizes, you might want to use the next thicker wire for 
the primary, and the next smaller wire for the secondary. That way the 
final losses and the amount of space required will be almost exactly the same as 
calculated by the sheet.</p>
<p>If your transformer uses lots of turns of thin 
wire, you are about ready to start winding at this point. But if it uses a 
winding that has few turns of a thick wire, you should check how well (or how 
poorly) that wire fits in an integer number of layers, considering the 
width of the bobbin, and about 5% of lost space due to the wire not being 
perfectly straight. The problem is this: If the sheet calculates you need 48 
turns of a certain wire size, and it happens that you can fit only 15 turns 
per layer, then you will end up with three complete layers, plus one additional 
layer in which you have just three turns! So the total height taken up in the 
window by those 48 turns will be as much as 4 complete layers, that could 
have 60 turns! Consequently, the winding might end up too high, and won&#39;t fit 
the window! Then you cannot assemble the core, and you have to unwind that 
winding, throw the wire away, get new (thinner) wire, do it again... you get the 
idea. Try to avoid such frustration!</p>
<p>When you are in the situation just described, it would 
be wise to try the next smaller wire size. It&#39;s very likely that this smaller 
wire size would accomodate 16 turns per layer, thus allowing you to wind the 48 
turns in three nice, clean, complete layers, and using up a little bit less 
space than calculated by the sheet. This can in turn allow you to use the next 
larger wire size for the other winding, which will almost completely compensate 
for the higher loss and voltage drop of the smaller wire you used for the 48 
turns!</p>
<p>Putting it in short words, you have to pick the best 
wire sizes for your transformer so that their cross sections are close enough to 
the calculated values, but still allow a good, space-saving distribution on the 
bobbin and thus inside the window area of the core.</p>
<p>Sometimes you might end up with a high current 
transformer requiring a very thick wire. Such a wire is very stiff! If the 
bobbin is small, you might not be able to bend that thick wire tightly enough 
around the corners of the bobbin. The result would be a huge loss of space, and 
the completed winding wouldn&#39;t fit in the window, making it unusable. To work 
around this problem, you can replace one thick wire by a bundle of seven wires, 
each of which is one third as thick as the single wire. Such a seven wire bundle 
twists very nicely into a round cable, and is more then 20 times as flexible as 
the single thick wire! It costs only very slightly more money, and performs 
great. So, this is the way to go when you have a need for such thick high 
current conductors. It&#39;s good to know that an AWG number 10 units higher is 
roughly one third the diameter. So, if you would need a #7 wire and this is too 
thick to wind comfortably, you can use 7 strands of #17, lightly twisted 
together.</p>
<p>Sometimes instead of using one thick wire you will also 
find it convenient to wind with two or three thinner wires in parallel, without 
twisting them. This technique can significantly ease the distribution of a 
winding in entire layers.</p>
<p>Another hint: Most transformers use some thin and some 
thick wire. For transformers that have the windings on top of each other 
(instead of side-by-side), I suggest to <strong>always</strong> first wind the windings that use the thin 
wire, then the ones using thicker wires, regardless of which will be primary and 
secondary. This allows to wind the stiffer wire on the outside, where the 
bending radius required is a lot larger and thus less demanding. Whether the 
primary is under or over the secondary has no significant effect on 
performance.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that my spreadsheet only 
considers transformers that have a single primary and a single secondary. But 
many transformers use several secondaries, and some use two or more primaries! 
In such cases you will have to do some more work manually. You should use the 
sheet to calculate the transformer, simulating only the main secondary, tweaking 
it for the total power, and then manually reduce the wire size of that 
secondary proportionally to the percentage of the total transformer power 
this secondary will have to deliver. Then you can add the other windings, 
calculating their turns number from the turns per volt calculated by the sheet, 
and the wire size from the current they have to carry, and the mm^2/A you 
selected.</p>
<p>Or if you have two equal secondaries (or two equal 
primaries!), you can let the sheet calculate a single secondary (or 
primary) of twice the voltage. That will produce the correct number of total 
turns and wire sizes. You only have to remember to cut the wire after 
having wound half of the turns, bring it out, start again and wind the 
second half!</p>
<p>You might have noticed that I didn&#39;t assign additional 
wire cross section to the primary, to account for the magnetizing current. The 
reason is that the magnetizing current is normally much smaller than the main 
current, and on top of that, the magnetizing current is 90 degrees out of phase 
with the main current! The vectorial sum of the main and magnetizing currents is 
so little higher than the main current alone, that there is usually no 
need to consider the difference.</p>
<p>You might also miss any discussion of core saturation. 
The problem is that&#39;s quite hard to discuss saturation of silicon steel 
cores, because they just don&#39;t saturate at a well defined level of flux 
density! Instead, the saturation is quite gradual: It might start at a level as 
low as 0.5 tesla, become more noticeable at 1 tesla, then the curve bends 
further, but even at 2 tesla there might be a significant amount of permeability 
left! The effect of this is that with increasing flux density, the 
magnetizing current increases more sharply, but it would be really hard to 
reach a level where the saturation makes the transformer stop working. So, 
the most important consideration about flux density is the sharply increasing 
core loss. Only when you are using very high flux density, would it be a good 
idea to allow some additional cross section for the primary wire, to accomodate 
the larger magnetizing current.</p>
<p>Enough calculations. Let&#39;s go to winding!<br clear="both"/></p>
<hr/>

<p><img height="338" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/tc1trafo.jpg" width="450"/>Very often, winding a transformer for a hobbyist 
will start with unwinding an old, burned one! The photo shows part of the guts 
of a Heathkit tube tester from the 1950&#39;s, which was given to me 
in damaged but restorable condition by my friend Renato Menare. Its power 
transformer worked, but got extremely hot in just one minute of operation, and 
started smelling burned after two minutes. </p>
<p>After restoring the tube tester, without touching the 
transformer, I used it for about a year, switching it on only for a minute at a 
time to test one tube, and then letting it cool off. But eventually the 
inevitable happened: The transformer burned out, filling my home with smoke.</p>
<p>Such a tube tester transformer  is one of the worst 
nightmares any transformer maker can get: It has two secondaries, each of 
which has a huge number of taps to provide all the different filament and plate 
voltages needed by any of the thousands of different tubes around in the 
1950s! It takes patience to rewind such a thing. Every few turns you have to 
install a tap!</p>
<p>The first step is removing the transformer from the 
circuit, unsoldering all wires and taking notes which wire goes where. The fact 
that may wires are the same color doesn&#39;t help. Then, the core has to be 
disassembled. To do that, you first remove the bolts, then push a sharp knife 
between the first and second lamination, prying them apart to break any glue or 
varnish or rust between them, then grab the lamination with flat pliers and 
wiggle it out. Depending on how much the core was compressed during manufacture, 
this can be quite hard to do, and one or two laminations might be damaged in the 
process. That&#39;s not the end of the world, the transformer should later work even 
with one or two laminations less. Usually, after removing the first few, the 
others come out easily. Sometimes each lamination needs a little help with the 
knife to come loose, while in other transformers the core falls apart on its own 
as soon as compression is relieved.<br clear="both"/></p>
<p><img height="338" src="https://ludens.cl/Electron/trafos/tc1roasted.jpg" width="450"/>Once the winding assembly has been freed of 
the core, it is mounted on a suitable wooden core in the winding machine. Then 
the windings are carefully unwound, letting the turns counter of the winding 
machine do its job. You should take notes on the number of turns of each 
winding, between each tap and the next, and anything else you find worthwhile 
noting down. Shooting pictures with a digital camera can also be very 
helpful, should you later suddenly get doubts about where each 
tap connection should be located!</p>
<p>You should also save the wire, so you can measure its 
diameter and find out what sizes of wire you need to buy. </p>
<p>As the layers of wire and paper come off, things 
usually turn darker and ever darker! This is because transformers work hottest 
at the inside. This picture shows severely carbonized insulation, both the paper 
and on the connection wires. Probably the paper slowly carbonized, 
becoming slightly conductive, causing further loss, further heating, until 
the beast failed for good. This is the problem of paper insulation!</p></div>
