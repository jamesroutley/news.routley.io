    <h1>Leonhard Euler&#39;s Letters to a German Princess</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Euler&#39;s letters to a German Princess were written in French to Princess Friederike Charlotte, a fifteen year old member of the Prussian royal family. When he began writing the letters, Euler was <span>53</span> years old and the Director of the Mathematics Section of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Over a period of two years, beginning in <span>1760</span>, he wrote <span>234</span> letters to the Princess. First published in three volumes <span>(</span>the first two in St Petersburg in <span>1768</span> and the third in Frankfurt in <span>1774)</span>, they were reprinted in Paris by the Marquis de Condorcet and Sylvestre François Lacroix in <span>1787</span>, <span>1788</span> and <span>1789</span>. The Paris editions were translated into English by the Scottish clergyman Henry Hunter <span>(1741</span>-<span>1802)</span> and published in <span>1795</span>. Hunter wrote in the Preface:-
</p><p><em>The time, I trust, is at hand, when the Letters of Euler, or some such book, will be daily on the breakfasting table, in the parlour of every female academy in the kingdom; and when a young woman, while learning the useful arts of pastry and plain-work, may likewise be acquainting herself with the phases of the moon, and the flux and reflux of the tides. And I am persuaded she may thrum on the guitar, or touch the keys of the harpsichord, much more agreeably both to herself and others, by studying a little the theory of sound. I have put the means of this in her power; it will be at once her fault, and her folly, if she neglect it.</em></p><p>
We give below three examples of these letters. In the first two letters, we note that various different editions of this work contain different measures. We keep Euler&#39;s original measures, in which he uses German miles <span>(</span>one German mile equals about <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn><mstyle mathsize="1.2em"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>5</mn></mfrac><mstyle mathsize="1em"></mstyle></mstyle></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">4\large\frac{3}{5}\normalsize</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span><span></span><span>4</span><span><span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span><span><span><span>5</span></span></span></span><span><span></span><span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span><span>3</span></span></span></span></span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span> English miles<span>)</span>. We also keep Euler&#39;s understanding of the solar system. Later editions of the work add in the other planets that had been discovered and minor planets such as Ceres etc. This is confusing, since the letter still has the original <span>1760</span> date. We have opted for the closest to Euler&#39;s original letter as possible.</p></div></div>
