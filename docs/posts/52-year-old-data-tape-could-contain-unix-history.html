    <h1>52 Year old data tape could contain Unix history</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A tape-based piece of unique Unix history may have been lying quietly in storage at the University of Utah for 50+ years. The question is whether researchers will be able to take this piece of middle-aged media and rewind it back to the 1970s to get the data off.</p>
<p>The news was <a href="https://discuss.systems/@ricci/115504720054699983" rel="nofollow">posted to Mastodon</a> by <a href="https://ricci.io/" rel="nofollow">Professor Robert Ricci</a> of the University of Utah&#39;s <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/" rel="nofollow">Kahlert School of Computing</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While cleaning a storage room, our staff found this tape containing #UNIX v4 from Bell Labs, circa 1973</p>

<p>Apparently no other complete copies are known to exist: <a href="https://gunkies.org/wiki/UNIX_Fourth_Edition" rel="nofollow">https://gunkies.org/wiki/UNIX_Fourth_Edition</a></p>

<p>We have arranged to deliver it to the Computer History Museum</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nine-track tape reel bears a handwritten label reading:</p>
<p>
  <strong>UNIX Original From Bell Labs V4 (See Manual for format)</strong>
</p>
<p>Ricci says that the handwriting on the label is that of his former advisor <a href="http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p45-v39n1j-andersen.pdf" rel="nofollow">Jay Lepreau</a> [PDF], who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031110707/http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/saltlaketribune/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&amp;pid=117597321" rel="nofollow">died of multiple myeloma in 2008</a>.</p>

    

<p>If it&#39;s what it says on the label, this is a notable discovery because <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V4" rel="nofollow">little of UNIX V4</a> remains. That&#39;s unfortunate as this specific version is especially interesting: it&#39;s the first version of UNIX in which the kernel and some of the core utilities were rewritten in the new C programming language. Until now, the only surviving parts known were the <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V4/nsys" rel="nofollow">source code</a> to a slightly older version of the kernel and a few <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V4/man" rel="nofollow"><code>man</code> pages</a> – plus the <a href="https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-v4man/v4man.pdf" rel="nofollow">Programmer&#39;s Manual</a> [PDF], from November 1973.</p>

        


        

<p>More was to follow – some hours later, <a href="https://discuss.systems/@ricci/115509057505895666" rel="nofollow">he continued</a>:</p>

<p>We have some more information on this! One of <a href="https://mastodon.social/@regehr" rel="nofollow">@regehr</a>&#39;s <a href="https://cv.thalia.dev/" rel="nofollow">grad students</a> did some excellent sleuthing and figured out that this was received by Martin Newell: <a href="https://archive.org/details/unix_news_july-30-1975/page/n9/mode/2up" rel="nofollow">https://archive.org/details/unix_news_july-30-1975/page/n9/mode/2up</a></p>

<p>If that name sounds familiar to you, it&#39;s probably because his teapot is ubiquitous in computer graphics: <a href="https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/teapot/" rel="nofollow">https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/teapot/</a></p>

<p>So, this is the original copy of UNIX Fourth Edition received from AT&amp;T by the inventor of the Utah Teapot – as seen in the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/13/windows_3d_pipes_screensaver/">original Windows NT OpenGL screensaver</a>.</p>

<p>The staff member who found it is planning to drive it to the CHM, rather than ship it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That being the <a href="https://computerhistory.org/" rel="nofollow">Computer History Museum</a> in Mountain View, California – which Google Maps tells us is a mere 771 miles away, a modest 12 hours&#39; drive. The software librarian at the CHM is the redoubtable <a href="https://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/BitSavers" rel="nofollow">Al Kossow of Bitsavers</a>, who <a href="https://oldbytes.space/@bitsavers/115505135441862982" rel="nofollow">commented</a> in the thread that he is on the case. On the TUHS mailing list, he <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2025-November/032765.html" rel="nofollow">explained</a> how he plans to do it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>taping off the head read amplifier, using a multi-channel high speed analog to digital converter which dumps into 100-ish gigabytes of RAM, then an analysis program Len Shustek wrote: <a href="https://github.com/LenShustek/readtape" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/LenShustek/readtape</a></p>

<p>It is a &#39;70s 1200ft 3M tape, likely 9 track, which has a pretty good chance of being recoverable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2025-November/032764.html" rel="nofollow">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is rare enough that I&#39;m pushing the recovery of it up near the top of my project queue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Reg</em> FOSS desk has occasionally corresponded with Kossow, and we feel sure that this precious find could be in no better hands. ®</p>
