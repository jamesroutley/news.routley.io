                <p>It&#39;s my honor to announce that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack">John Carmack</a> and I have initiated a friendly bet of $10,000* to the 501(c)(3) charity of the winner‚Äôs choice:</p><blockquote><strong>By January 1st, 2030, completely autonomous self-driving cars meeting <a href="https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/assets/cm/content/blog/sae-j3016-visual-chart_5.3.21.pdf">SAE J3016 level 5</a> will be commercially available for passenger use in major cities.</strong></blockquote><p>I am betting <em>against</em>, and John is betting <em>for</em>.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have another long-term bet:</p>‚Äî John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1499803694522589187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2022</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>By ‚Äúcompletely autonomous‚Äù, per the <a href="https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/assets/cm/content/blog/sae-j3016-visual-chart_5.3.21.pdf">SAE level 5 definition</a>, we mean the vehicle performs all driving tasks under all conditions ‚Äì except in the case of natural disasters or emergencies. A human passenger enters the vehicle and selects a destination. Zero human attention or interaction is required during the journey. </p><figure><a href="https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/assets/cm/content/blog/sae-j3016-visual-chart_5.3.21.pdf"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/03/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1440" height="1101" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/image.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/image.png 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/03/image.png 1440w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></a></figure><p>By &#34;major cities&#34; we mean any of the top 10 most populous cities in the United States of America.</p><p>To be clear, I am betting <em>against</em> because I think everyone is <strong>underestimating how difficult fully autonomous driving really is</strong>. I am by no means against self driving vehicles in any way! I&#39;d much rather spend my time in a vehicle reading, watching videos, or talking to my family and friends ‚Ä¶ anything, really, instead of driving. I also think fully autonomous vehicles are a fascinating, incredibly challenging computer science problem, and I want everyone reading this to take it as just that, a <em>challenge</em>. Prove me wrong! Make it happen by 2030, and I&#39;ll be popping champagne along with you and everyone else!</p><p>(My take on VR is <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/i-tried-vr-and-it-was-just-ok/">far more pessimistic</a>. VR just‚Ä¶ isn&#39;t going to happen, in any &#34;changing the world&#34; form, in our lifetimes. This is a subject for a different blog post, but I think AR and projection will do much more for us, far sooner.)</p><p>I&#39;d like to thank John for suggesting this friendly wager as a fun way to generate STEM publicity. He is, and always will be, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/you-dont-need-millions-of-dollars/">one of my biggest heroes</a>. Go read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812972155/codihorr-20">Masters of Doom</a> if you haven&#39;t, already!</p><p>And while I have you, we&#39;re still looking for code contributions in our project to <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/updating-the-single-most-influential-book-of-the-basic-era/">update the most famous programming book of the BASIC era</a>. Proceeds from that project will also go to charity. üòé</p><p>* We may adjust the amount up or down to adjust for inflation as mutually agreed upon in 2030, so the money has the desired impact.</p>
