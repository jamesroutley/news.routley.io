  <p><b>The deadline for the current round (2025.1) is Wednesday 30 April 2025 at 09:00 UTC<span id="countdown"></span>.</b></p>
  <p>APL is a programming language that will change the way you think about solving problems. You don’t need to know any APL or programming at all to participate in this challenge; the question texts will teach you everything you need to know to progress. To do this, we have kept what we teach very simple, even though APL is slightly more complicated than what we describe.</p>
  <p>There are four rounds of the APL Challenge each year. You don’t need to participate in an earlier round to participate in the current one. Each round has ten problems and runs for three months, after which <a href="https://dyalog.com" target="_blank">Dyalog Ltd</a> awards three USD 100 prizes. You don’t have to answer every question, but your chance of winning increases as you answer more questions. A list of <a href="https://www.dyalog.com/apl-challenge.htm#win" target="_blank">winners of previous rounds</a> is available on the Dyalog website.</p>
  <p>If you’re interested but don’t want to participate in this round, please register anyway (using the button at the top) so that we can notify you of updates and tell you about future rounds. You can ask us to stop sending you emails at any time.</p>
  <h4>Let’s get started…</h4>
  <p>Use <a href="https://tryapl.org/" target="_blank">TryAPL</a> to experiment and find your answer. You can write APL symbols by clicking on them in the language bar above the area where you write APL code.</p>
  <p><span>Although you can begin without registering – most browsers will store your answers until you register – you must be <a href="#" onclick="$(&#39;#btlogin&#39;).click()">registered and logged in</a> to submit (send in) your answers. </span>When you’re happy with your answer, hit <kbd><span><i></i><span> Submit</span></span></kbd>. The system will only allow you to submit correct answers.</p>
  <p>Several problems include some data you need. You should be able to copy text that is written with <code>code letters like this</code> by clicking on it, but note that not all browsers allow this.</p>
  
  <details id="prizes">
    <summary><i></i>Prizes</summary>
    <p>Anyone can win a prize except Dyalog employees and associates. We reserve the right to choose the winners at our sole discretion and will not enter into conversation about our choices.</p>
    <p>All prizes are denominated in U.S. dollars, but can be awarded in U.S. dollars (USD), pounds sterling (GBP) or euros (EUR) by electronic transfer to a bank account or a PayPal account. No other forms of payment will be made.</p>
    <p>If you are selected as a winner but are unable or unwilling to accept the prize, you cannot transfer the prize or designate someone else as the winner. Prizes must be claimed within three weeks of being notified or you forfeit the right to that prize.</p>
    <p>If you accept a prize, you will be solely responsible for all applicable taxes related to accepting that prize.</p>

    <h4>Conditions</h4>
    <p>All participants must submit to these rules.</p>
    <p>Multiple registrations to a single round are not allowed.</p>
    <p>Participants must provide truthful and accurate information regarding contact and personal information.</p>
    <p>Participants must not publish their solutions prior to the end of the challenge round. Doing so will be considered grounds for disqualification from the challenge round.</p>
    <p>Only entries that are received by the deadline are eligible. We cannot accept responsibility for entries that are lost, delayed or damaged. Proof of sending an online entry is not proof that we received it.</p>
    <p>Entries not submitted in accordance with these terms and all other rules and directions (at the sole discretion of Dyalog Ltd) will be excluded from the challenge round.</p>
    <p>Your submission and its contents can be used at the discretion of Dyalog Ltd.</p>
    <h4>Collaboration</h4>
    <p>Participants must ensure that all solutions that they submit are produced and owned by them.</p>
    <p>You can collaborate with others in learning APL and solving the problems, but each submission must be made by a single person and only that person will be eligible for a prize. Each collaborator can submit an entry.</p>

    <summary><i></i>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</summary>
    <h4>In APL, how do I…?</h4>
    <p>In fairness to all, we cannot provide answers to challenge-specific questions. Instead, have a look at the <a href="https://dyalog.com/getting-started.htm" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> guide.</p>
    <h4>Why is my correct answer not accepted?</h4>
    <p>The purpose of the APL Challenge is to teach specific parts of APL, so we require solutions that use the techniques we teach. Most problems can be solved in many ways, and the techniques we teach here do not necessarily lead to the best code. If you want to explore alternative answers, then you can use <a href="https://tryapl.org/" target="_blank">TryAPL</a> to do so.</p>
    <h4>Why can I not change my answer?</h4>
    <p>When you test or submit a correct answer, we lock it down for you, so it isn’t accidentally overwritten with an incorrect answer. All correct answers are equally eligible for winning. If you want to explore alternative answers, then you can use <a href="https://tryapl.org/" target="_blank">TryAPL</a> to do so.</p>
    <h4>Does the possibility of winning prize money classify as commercial use of Dyalog?</h4>
    <p>No.</p>
    <h4>What do I do if there is a problem with this website or I have a question about a problem?</h4>
    <p>Please report any problems or direct any questions to <a href="mailto:challenge@dyalog.com">challenge@dyalog.com</a>.</p>
    <h4>I did not receive an email with a code when registering. What should I do?</h4>
    <p>Click <kbd><span>Register</span></kbd> again and wait for 5–10 minutes. Make sure you check your spam folder. If the code still doesn&#39;t come through, then please report the problem to <a href="mailto:challenge@dyalog.com">challenge@dyalog.com</a>.</p>

</div><div id="P2025101"><div><p><strong>Note:</strong> In this problem, you’re asked to enter some APL code, including an APL symbol and the <i>data</i> (text or numbers) given to it. Your code will be tested by the APL Challenge system to check that it gives the correct answer and uses the methods described below.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 data-menu-title="1-2-3">1: Easy as 1-2-3</h3>
<p>It is easy to count in APL. Just write the symbol <code>⍳</code> (<i>iota</i>, a Greek letter), to the left of a number; this will give you all the whole numbers from 1 to the number that you wrote. (<i>Iota</i> is like an <i><b>i</b></i> for <i><b>i</b>ntegers</i>, which means whole numbers.) For example, <code>⍳ 7</code> gives <code>1 2 3 4 5 6 7</code>
</p><hr/>
<p>Write some APL code that uses <code>⍳</code> to get the numbers from 1 to 12. The result should be <code>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12</code></p>
</div></div><div id="P2025102"><div><p>In this problem, you’re asked to enter some APL code, including an APL symbol and the <i>data</i> (text or numbers) given to it. Your code will be tested by the APL Challenge system to check that it gives the correct answer and uses the methods described below.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 data-menu-title="Larger">2: I’m Larger than You</h3>
<p>In APL, we use the symbol <code>⌈</code> (<i>up-stile</i>) to find which of two numbers is the largest. The symbol looks like a vertical line with a mark at the highest value. This is because it compares the number on its left with the number on its right, and gives the one that is highest. For example, <code>5 ⌈ 2</code> gives <code>5</code> because 5 is a higher value than 2.</p>
<p>APL users usually call <code>⌈</code> <i>Maximum</i>. <i>Maximum</i> – and all other basic mathematical symbols of APL – can work on multiple numbers at once. For example, <code>5 ⌈ 2 7 1 8</code> gives <code>5 7 5 8</code> because:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>5 ⌈ 2</code> is 5 as 5 is larger than 2 </li>
<li><code>5 ⌈ 7</code> is 7 as 7 is larger than 5 </li>
<li><code>5 ⌈ 1</code> is 5 as 5 is larger than 1 </li>
<li><code>5 ⌈ 8</code> is 8 as 8 is larger than 5 </li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>Write some APL code that uses a single <code>⌈</code> to change the numbers <code>31 41 59 26</code> into <code>50 50 59 50</code>.</p>

Your code will be tested by the APL Challenge system to check that it gives the correct answer and uses the methods described below.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 data-menu-title="Where">3: Where Are You?</h3>
<p>In APL, text must appear between single quotes (<code>&#39;</code>). For example, <code>&#39;ABC&#39;</code> will give a result that looks like <code>ABC</code>.</p>
<p><i>Equal To</i> (<code>=</code>) can be used to check whether letters are the same. It gives <code>1</code> when letters are the same and <code>0</code> when letters are different. For example, <code>&#39;B&#39; = &#39;C&#39;</code> will give <code>0</code> and <code>&#39;D&#39; = &#39;D&#39;</code> will give <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>As well as comparing single letters, APL can also compare lists of letters (also called as <em>texts</em>). For example, <code>&#39;HELLO&#39; = &#39;WORLD&#39;</code> gives <code>0 0 0 1 0</code> because:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><code>0</code>: no, </td><td><code>H</code> </td><td>is not equal to </td><td><code>W</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>0</code>: no, </td><td><code>E</code> </td><td>is not equal to </td><td><code>O</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>0</code>: no, </td><td><code>L</code> </td><td>is not equal to </td><td><code>R</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>1</code>: yes, </td><td><code>L</code> </td><td>is equal to </td><td><code>L</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>0</code>: no, </td><td><code>O</code> </td><td>is not equal to </td><td><code>D</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>You can also compare a single letter with a whole text. APL will compare the single letter to each letter of the text.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Write some APL code using <i>Equal To</i> that shows where the <q>R</q>s are in <code>&#39;RASPBERRY&#39;</code>. The answer should be <code>1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0</code>.</p>
</div></div><div id="P2025104"><div><p><strong>Note:</strong> In this problem, you’re asked to enter an APL <i>expression</i> (some APL code), including <i>arguments</i> (data given to APL symbols). Your code will be tested by the APL Challenge system to check that it gives the correct answer and uses the methods described below.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 data-menu-title="Greatest">4: The Greatest Number</h3>
<p>The APL symbols you’ve met so far take either one data argument on the right or a data argument on each side. These symbols are called <em>functions</em>. APL also has <em>operators</em>. These are similar to functions, but, on the left, they take a function instead of data. Each operator uses the given function with the given data in a specific way.</p>
<p><i>Insert</i> (<code>/</code>) is such an operator. It takes a list on its right, and a function on its left. The function could be a common mathematical function (like <code>+</code> or <code>×</code>) or, for example, <code>=</code> (<i>Equal To</i>) from <a href="https://challenge.dyalog.com/?goto=P2025103">problem 3</a>. <em>Insert</em> inserts the symbol between the items of the list. For example, you can use <i>Insert</i> to add up all the numbers in a list: <code>+/ 1 2 3 4</code> gives <code>10</code> because it is the same as <code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Using <i>Maximum</i> (<code>⌈</code>) from <a href="https://challenge.dyalog.com/?goto=P2025102">problem 2</a>, find the largest number in the list <code>2 7 1 8 2 8 1 8 2 8 4 6</code>. The result should be <code>8</code>.</p>
</div></div><div id="P2025105"><div><p>In this problem, you’re asked to enter an APL <i>expression</i> (some APL code), including <i>arguments</i> (data given to APL symbols). Your code will be tested by the APL Challenge system to check that it gives the correct answer and uses the methods described below.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 data-menu-title="Table">5: Cards on the Table</h3>
<p>If you put <code>∘.</code> (<i>jot dot</i>, but sometimes called <i>Table</i>) immediately to left of a function, then it produces a <i>table</i> for that function. It does this by inserting the function between all the combinations of numbers from the arguments. If the resulting table had row and column headings, the left argument would be used as the headings for the rows (down the left side) and the right argument would be used as the headings for the columns (across the top). Here’s a multiplication table (times table) in APL form – and as you might see it in a book (showing the row and column headings, even though they are not table data):</p>
<pre>      2 3 4 ∘.× 2 3 4 5
4  6  8 10
6  9 12 15
8 12 16 20
</pre>

<table id="timestable">
<tbody><tr><th>×</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th></tr>
<tr><th>2</th><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><th>3</th><td>6</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>15</td></tr>
<tr><th>4</th><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>16</td><td>20</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>As in the above example, when we write APL code and its result together, we often write the code above the result, with six spaces to the left of the code.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Using <i>Table</i> (<code>∘.</code>), create an addition table (plus table) for the numbers 3, 1, and 4. The result should look like this:</p>
<pre>6 4 7
4 2 5
7 5 8
</pre>

<hr/>
<h3 data-menu-title="Identity">6: Identity Matrix</h3>
<p>An APL function takes the answer of all the code to its right as its right argument. For example, <code>2×3+4</code> gives <code>14</code>, rather than the <code>10</code> that you might expect. This is because the <code>×</code> takes the answer of <code>3+4</code> as its right argument. However, you can use round brackets to change the order in which things are calculated, limiting any right argument so it only goes as far as the nearest closing bracket <q>…<code>)</code></q> on its right: <code>(2×3)+4</code> gives <code>10</code>.</p>
<p>When you used <i>Equal To</i> (<code>=</code>) in <a href="https://challenge.dyalog.com/?goto=P2025103">problem 3</a>, you were using it to compare letters in a text. However, it also works on numbers. For example:</p>
<pre>      1 = 3 1 4 1 5 9
0 1 0 1 0 0
</pre>
<hr/>
<p>Using round brackets, <code>⍳</code> (<i>iota</i> from <a href="https://challenge.dyalog.com/?goto=P2025101">problem 1</a>), <code>=</code>, and <code>∘.</code> (<i>Table</i> from <a href="https://challenge.dyalog.com/?goto=P2025105">problem 5</a>), create a 5-by-5 table that has <code>1</code>s on the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right, with all other numbers being <code>0</code>s. This is known as <i>an identity matrix of size 5</i> and looks like this:</p>
<pre>1 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 1
</pre>

<hr/>
<h3 data-menu-title="Identities">7: More Identity Matrices</h3>
<p>You can create your own function by putting an expression (for example, <code>⍳10</code>) in curly brackets (for example, <code>{⍳10}</code>). Within this expression (in our example, <code>⍳10</code>), any <code>⍵</code> (<i>omega</i>, the right-most letter of the Greek alphabet) is replaced by the argument to the right of the closing curly bracket ( <code>}</code> ).</p>
<p>For example, a function that multiplies its argument by two could be written <code>{2×⍵}</code>, so <code>{2×⍵} 5</code> gives <code>10</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Using what you learnt in <a href="https://challenge.dyalog.com/?goto=P2025106">problem 6</a>, write a function that gives an identity matrix of the given size. For example:</p>
<pre>      {<i>answer</i>} <code>5</code>
1 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 1

      {<i>answer</i>} <code>2</code>
1 0
0 1

      {<i>answer</i>} <code>6</code>
1 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 1

<hr/>
<h3 data-menu-title="Spell">8: Spell it Out</h3>
<p>You can select specific letters from a text by putting square brackets ( <code>[]</code> ) to the right of the text. Inside the square brackets, you put numbers that say which letters you want to get from the text. For example, <code>&#39;ABCDE&#39;[1]</code> gives you the letter <code>A</code> because that’s the 1st letter of <code>&#39;ABCDE&#39;</code>. Similarly, <code>&#39;ABCDE&#39;[5 2 2]</code> gives you <code>EBB</code>, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 5<sup>th</sup> letter of <code>&#39;ABCDE&#39;</code> is <code>E</code></li>
<li>The 2<sup>nd</sup> letter of <code>&#39;ABCDE&#39;</code> is <code>B</code></li>
<li>The 2<sup>nd</sup> letter of <code>&#39;ABCDE&#39;</code> is <code>B</code></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a text that consists of the corresponding uppercase letters from the English alphabet. For example:</p>
<pre>      {<i>answer</i>} 1 2 3 2 1
ABCBA

      {<i>answer</i>} 1 16 12
APL

      {<i>answer</i>} 4 25 1 12 15 7

<h3 data-menu-title="How Many">9: How Many of Each?</h3>
<p>When using a function with <i>Insert</i> (<code>/</code> from <a href="https://challenge.dyalog.com/?goto=P2025104">problem 4</a>) on a table, it inserts the function between the items in each row in the table. For example, take the multiplication table from <a href="https://challenge.dyalog.com/?goto=P2025105">problem 5</a>:</p>
<pre>      2 3 4 ∘.× 2 3 4 5
4  6  8 10
6  9 12 15
8 12 16 20
</pre>
<p>Now we put <code>+/</code> in front of the table:</p>
<pre>      +/ 2 3 4 ∘.× 2 3 4 5
28 42 56
</pre>
<p>This tells us that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first row had a sum of 28 (from <code>+/ 4 6 8 10</code> which is <code>4 + 6 + 8 + 10</code>)</li>
<li>the second row had a sum of 42 (from <code>+/ 6 9 12 15</code>) which is <code>6 + 9 + 12 + 15</code>)</li>
<li>the third row had a sum of 56 (from <code>+/ 8 12 16 20</code> which is <code>8 + 12 + 16 + 20</code>)</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>Using <code>+</code> with <code>/</code> and <code>∘.</code> with <code>=</code> (<i>Equal To</i> from <a href="https://challenge.dyalog.com/?goto=P2025103">problem 3</a>), write a function that takes an uppercase text and, for each of the three letters <q>A</q>, <q>P</q>, and <q>L</q>, counts how many there are in the text. For example:</p><pre>      {<i>answer</i>} &#39;DYALOG APL&#39;
2 1 2
</pre>
<p>This tells us that <code>&#39;DYALOG APL&#39;</code> has 2 <q>A</q>s, 1 <q>P</q>, and 2 <q>L</q>s.</p>
<pre>      {<i>answer</i>} &#39;MISSISSIPPI&#39;
0 2 0

      {<i>answer</i>} &#39;THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG!&#39;
1 1 1

<h3 data-menu-title="Histogram">10: Histogram</h3>
<p>You have used <code>=</code> in several earlier questions, but APL has additional comparison functions, such as <i>Less Than</i> (<code>&lt;</code>), <i>Less Than Or Equal To</i> (<code>≤</code>), <i>Greater Than Or Equal To</i> (<code>≥</code>), <i>Greater Than</i> (<code>&gt;</code>), and <i>Not Equal To</i> (<code>≠</code>). All these functions give <code>1</code> for <q>yes</q> and <code>0</code> for <q>no</q>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Using everything that you’ve learnt so far, write a function that takes a list of numbers between 1 and 6 (representing dice throws) and draws a histogram (bar chart) showing how many times each number was thrown. Use dashes (<code>-</code>) to show how many times each number was thrown, with the number of 1s shown on the first line, the number of 2s shown on the second line, and so on. Use spaces (<code> </code>) to fill out the table so it becomes rectangular. For example:</p>
<pre>      {<i>answer</i>} 6 2 1 3 5 6 6 4 1 2
-- 
-- 
-
