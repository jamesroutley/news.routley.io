    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, October 4, 2024</em></p><p>I&#39;ve been working on tinyping for quite a while now, in various forms. Six or seven months, in fact. I feel frustrated that I don&#39;t have anything usable to show for it. When I stopped doing thing-a-month, <a href="https://bytes.zone/micro/stopping-thing-a-month/">I wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p>it turns out I&#39;m pretty good at planning projects like this, but when I have such limited free time it&#39;s way too easy to overcommit.</p></blockquote><p>That&#39;s still true! And unfortunately, removing the constraint of a month did not help. I have spent more time figuring out the local-first ecosystem than actually building something useful, and it&#39;s really starting to annoy me.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p><p>So I wonder: what do the ideas in tinyping look like I have to build them in an hour? A day? What does a different version of extreme constraint look like?</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p>So I&#39;m going to try that. A successful solution should:</p><ul><li>Notify someone that a new ping is ready to answer (but not tell them when the next one will be coming.)</li><li>Let them assign a single tag to a ping (and optionally additional information like energy level)</li><li>Make sure the distribution of pings is correct (<code>math.log(random.random()) / lambda * -1</code>)</li></ul><p>Ideally, this should all happen in a stable way (e.g. reliably setting the next ping with PCR instead of using system randomness) but it&#39;s fine if it doesn&#39;t.</p><p>Just to prove I could do it quickly, I spent a little time (maybe two, three hours?) making a barebones version in Rust that just does the core part of the collection loop, nothing more. It lives at https://github.com/bytes-zone/beeps. You can download the binaries and try it, if you like (it always tries to invoke <code>say</code>, so the Windows and Linux binaries are a slight lie; get in touch if it matters to you.)</p></article></div>
