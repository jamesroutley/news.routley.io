    <h1>Ask HN: Are things getting more convenient but less satisfying?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I read a post on HN recently where a guy in his teens used to visit a construction site to watch how peopled worked and even help them for small fee. Now he could just watch a YouTube video about it in 10 different ways but the experience differs in that the workers used to treat him well and converse with him, which obviously made him a deep impression.</p><p>So I&#39;d be interested to generalize this: with things getting more and more digital and disembodied (ahem, ChatGPT), does it produce convenience at the expense of contentment?</p></div></div></div>
