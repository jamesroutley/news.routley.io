    <h1>Show HN: OpenFreeMap – Open-Source Map Hosting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <h2 id="what-is-openfreemap">What is OpenFreeMap?</h2>
<p>OpenFreeMap lets you display custom maps on your website and apps for free.</p>
<p>You can either self-host or use our public instance. Everything is <strong>open-source</strong>, including the full production setup — there’s no ‘open-core’ model here. Check out our <a href="https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap">GitHub</a>. The map data comes from OpenStreetMap.</p>
<p>Using our <strong>public instance</strong> is completely free: there are no limits on the number of map views or requests. There’s no registration, no user database, no API keys, and no cookies. We aim to cover the running costs of our public instance through donations.</p>
<p>We also provide <strong>weekly</strong> full planet downloads both in Btrfs and MBTiles formats.</p> <h2>How can I use it?</h2> </div><div> <p>
Have a look at the default styles and read more about how to integrate it to your website or

<p>I’m Zsolt Ero (<a href="https://blog.hyperknot.com/">blog</a>, <a href="mailto:zsolt@openfreemap.org">email</a>).</p>
<p>After 9 years of running my own map tile infrastructure for <a href="https://maphub.net/">MapHub</a>, I’ve open-sourced it and launched OpenFreeMap.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-build-this-project">Why did you build this project?</h2>
<p>OpenStreetMap is one of the most important collective projects in history. It began 20 years ago, and today, 3 million edits are made each day!</p>
<p>For a long time, when you wanted to use the map on your website or app, you had to look for a commercial map tile provider and hope your site didn’t become too popular. Otherwise, you might end up with a $10,000 bill in a single day, as Hoodmaps <a href="https://x.com/levelsio/status/1730659933232730443">did</a>.</p>
<p>Self-hosting was an option, but it required a big server and a lot of time to get it right.</p>
<p>Since I’ve spent many years developing the map tile infrastructure for <a href="https://maphub.net/">MapHub</a>, I decided to open-source it so anyone can use it. With OpenFreeMap, you now have the option to either set up your own server with just one line of code or use our public instance.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-offer-a-free-public-instance">How can you offer a free public instance ?</h2>
<p>There is no technical reason why map hosting costs as much as it does today. Vector tiles are just static files. It’s true that serving hundreds of millions of files is not easy, but at the end of the day, they are just files.</p>
<p>Financially, the plan is to keep renting servers until they cover the bandwidth. I believe it can be self-sustainable if enough people subscribe to the support plans.</p>
<p>If this project helps you save on your map hosting costs, please consider subscribing to a support plan.</p>
<h2 id="is-commercial-usage-allowed">Is commercial usage allowed?</h2>
<p>Yes.</p> <h2>How can I donate or support this project?</h2> <p>
If this project helps you save on your map hosting costs, please subscribe to one of our support
  plans here. Alternatively, sponsor us on <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/hyperknot">GitHub Sponsors</a>.
</p>  <p>On <strong>Gold</strong> level and above, we offer personalised technical support by email. Otherwise, support is via GitHub <a href="https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap/discussions">Discussions</a>.</p>
<p>If we ever receive a <strong>Diamond</strong> level supporter, we’ll put their logo on this page.</p>
<p>When subscribing to a support plan, you receive an invoice for each of your payments.</p>
<p>Note: if you want to make a single donation, you can do this via <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/hyperknot">GitHub Sponsors</a>. However, please understand that the nature of this project needs recurring donations to cover the server costs.</p>   <h2 id="what-is-the-tech-stack">What is the tech stack?</h2>
<p>There is no tile server running; only nginx serving a Btrfs image with 300 million hard-linked files. This was my idea; I haven’t read about anyone else doing this in production, but it works really well. (You can read more about it on <a href="https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap">GitHub</a>.)</p>
<p>There is no cloud, just dedicated servers.</p>
<p>Special thanks go to <a href="https://github.com/msbarry">Michael Barry</a> for developing <a href="https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler">Planetiler</a>. It made it possible to generate the tiles in 5 hours instead of 5 weeks. The map schema is <a href="https://github.com/openmaptiles/openmaptiles">OpenMapTiles</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap-styles">styles</a> are forked and heavily modified.</p>
