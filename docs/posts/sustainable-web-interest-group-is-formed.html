						<p>W3C is pleased to announce the formation of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/sustainableweb/">Sustainable Web Interest Group</a>. The mission of the Sustainable Web Interest Group is to improve digital sustainability so that the Web works better for all people and the planet. The digital industry is responsible for 2-5% of global emissions, more than the aviation industry. If the Internet were a country it would be one of the top five polluters. The amount of water, energy, and minerals required increases annually, often putting the burden on developing economies. </p><p>The Sustainable Web IG will publish the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/">Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG)</a>. This set of guidelines and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb">associated materials</a> were drafted by the Sustainable Web Design Community Group. The WSG explains how to design and implement digital products and services that put people and the planet first. The guidelines are best practices based on measurable, evidence-based research; aimed at end-users, web workers, stakeholders, tool authors, educators, and policymakers. They are in line with the <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/">Sustainable Web Manifesto</a> and aligned with <a href="https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/">GRI Standards</a> and the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a> to help organizations incorporate digital products and services into broader sustainability reporting initiatives. These guidelines will enable people to better understand the Internet’s impact on sustainability reporting. This includes emissions as well as stewardship principles. </p><p>In addition to publishing the guidelines, the IG plans to liaise with regulatory bodies to improve compliance targets. The membership of the community group from which this IG grew has excellent relationships with many organizations that will enable open discussions. </p><p>The Sustainable Web IG will be chaired by Tim Frick of MightyBytes, Ines Akrap, an Invited Expert from StoryBlok, and Mike Gifford, an Invited Expert who works for Civic Actions. Alexander Dawson will continue as editor. I, Tzviya Siegman, will be Team Contact of the group.</p><p>The group will work to improve measurability, which will enable more accurate information about sustainability and create more educational materials to enable implementations of the Web Sustainability Guidelines. </p><p>We look forward to enabling a more sustainable Web and hope you will <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/sustainableweb/">join us</a>.</p>
