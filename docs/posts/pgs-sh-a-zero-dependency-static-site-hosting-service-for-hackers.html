    <h2>Create your account with Public-Key Cryptography</h2>
    <p>We don&#39;t want your email address.</p>
    <p>To get started, simply ssh into our content management system:</p>
    <pre>ssh new@pgs.sh</pre>
    <p>
      note: <code>new</code> is a special username that will always send you to account
      creation, even with multiple accounts associated with your key-pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      note: getting permission denied? <a href="https://pgs.sh/help.html#permission-denied">read this</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, just set a username and you&#39;re ready to start writing! When you SSH
      again, use your username that you set in the CMS.
    </p>

    <h2>Publish your site with one command</h2>
    <p>
        When your site is ready to be published, copy the files to our server with a familiar
        command:
    </p>
    <pre>scp -r * pgs.sh:/myproject</pre>
    <p>
      That&#39;s it!  There&#39;s no need to formally create a project, we
      create them on-the-fly.  Further, we provide TLS for every project
      automatically.  In this case the url for the project above would
      look something like <code>https://{username}-myproject.pgs.sh</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Manage your projects with a remote CLI</h2>
    <p>
      Our management system is done via ssh commands.  Type the following command to learn more:
    </p>
    <pre>ssh pgs.sh help</pre>

    <h2>Project promotion and rollbacks</h2>
    <p>
      Additionally you can setup a pipeline for promotion and rollbacks,
      which will instantly update your project.
    </p>
    <pre>ssh pgs.sh link project-prod project-d0131d4</pre>
    <p>
      A common way to perform promotions within pgs.sh is to setup CI/CD so every
      push to <code>main</code> would trigger a build and create a new project
      based on the git commit hash (e.g. <code>project-d0131d4</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      This command will create a symbolic link from <code>project-prod</code>
      to <code>project-d0131d4</code>. Want to rollback a release?
      Just change the link for <code>project-prod</code> to a previous project.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also built a <a href="https://github.com/picosh/pgs-action">github action</a>
      that handles all the logic for uploading to pgs.sh.
      <a href="https://erock-git-neovimcraft.pgs.sh/tree/main/item/.github/workflows/deploy.yml.html#27">Here&#39;s an example of it in action</a>.

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Creating a static website should be as simple as copying files from a local folder to a server.
      We also believe in creating limited but feature-rich products without the user needing to install
      anything on their computer.
