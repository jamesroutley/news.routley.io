    <h1>Ditch banks – Go with money market funds and treasuries</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Banks and credit unions offer savings accounts and CDs. Brokers such as Vanguard, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab offer money market funds and Treasuries. They serve similar purposes at a high level. Both a savings account and a money market fund allow flexible deposits and withdrawals. Both CDs and Treasuries offer a fixed interest rate for a fixed term.</p>

<p>While most discussions on these products from banks and brokers center around having FDIC insurance or not (see <a href="https://thefinancebuff.com/brokerage-account-safe-no-fdic.html">No FDIC Insurance – Why a Brokerage Account Is Safe</a>), many people don’t realize that <strong>there’s a fundamental difference</strong> between the roles banks and brokers play. I mentioned this difference in my <a href="https://thefinancebuff.com/money-market-fund-high-yield-savings-account-guide.html">Guide to Money Market Fund &amp; High Yield Savings Account</a>. It’s worth highlighting it again.</p>
<p>The fundamental difference is that banks and credit unions offer a <strong>two-party private contract</strong> while a broker serves as an <strong>intermediary between you and the public market</strong>.</p>
<h2>Two-Party Private Contract</h2>
<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="647" height="186" src="https://thefinancebuff.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bank-or-credit-union.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://thefinancebuff.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bank-or-credit-union.jpg 647w, https://thefinancebuff.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bank-or-credit-union-640x184.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px"/></figure></div>
<p>A two-party private contract means anything goes as long as one party makes the other party agree to the terms. If a bank gets you to agree to a 0.04% rate in a savings account or a 0.05% rate in a 10-month CD (these are actual current rates from a large bank), that’s what you’ll get regardless of what the rate <em>should</em> be. The bank sets the rate. They don’t need to justify it. You get a bad contract if you aren’t aware of the going rate.</p>
<p>A bad contract doesn’t have to be this obvious. It’s been over a year now since the Fed raised the short-term interest rates above 5%. The rate on a “good” online high-yield savings account such as the one from Ally Bank is currently 4.2% while a money market fund pays 5% or more. It’s 4.2% from the bank only because the bank says so. You’re paying a “familiarity penalty” when you stay with Ally.</p>
<p>I’m not picking on Ally specifically. It works the same at Marcus, Synchrony, Amex, Discover, Capital One, or Barclays. Ken Tumin, the founder of DepositAccounts.com, made this observation in April 2024:</p>

Their online savings account rates are about 100 bps under what you can get from MMFs, T-bills and the top OSAs. <a href="https://t.co/n6p4DNr93e">https://t.co/n6p4DNr93e</a></p>— Ken Tumin (@KenTumin) <a href="https://twitter.com/KenTumin/status/1779562184961323451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>If you take a step back and ask why banks can benefit from customer inertia in the first place, you realize that’s the nature of a two-party private contract. Customers must take the initiative to break out of a bad contract.</p>
<p>Some banks play tricks by <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2024/report-customers-feel-tricked-by-banks-savings-offerings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offering a new savings account under a different name</a> with competitive rates while keeping the rate low on the existing savings accounts. The rate is low on the existing account only because that’s the contract you agreed to. The bank isn’t obligated to move you to the new program because that’s not in the contract. Nor does the bank have to tell you that you can switch to the new program to get a higher rate. It’s up to you to find out and take action.</p>
<p>Rates at many large credit unions aren’t any better. I’m a member of a well-regarded credit union. It’s the largest credit union in the country by far, with three times the assets of the second-largest credit union. The rate on its savings account is 1.5% when you have $50,000 in the account. That’s 3.5% lower than the yield in a money market fund.</p>
<p>A good contract today can turn into a bad contract tomorrow. How the contract will change is in the contract itself. A bank offers 5.0% APY on a 13-month CD today. That’s an OK rate but what happens after 13 months? You agree in the contract it will automatically renew to a 12-month CD at a rate set by the bank at that time unless you take specific actions to stop it within a short window. Guess what rate the bank will set on its 12-month CD? Almost always a bad one. It works this way because you agreed to the contract.</p>
<p>When you have a two-party private contract, your interest is in direct conflict with the other party in the contract. The onus is on you to know whether the contract is good or bad. It’s on you to watch when a good contract turns into a bad contract. <em>Caveat emptor</em>. You’ll have to jump from contract to contract if you don’t want to get stuck in a bad contract.</p>
<p>Some people are more alert in monitoring and jumping. They have a chance to “beat the market” but they pay for it with a heavy mental workload and time spent on opening new accounts and closing old accounts. Many fail to be vigilant at some point. They start paying the “familiarity penalty” because it’s too tiring otherwise.</p>
<h2>Market Intermediary</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="763" height="240" src="https://thefinancebuff.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/broker.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://thefinancebuff.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/broker.jpg 763w, https://thefinancebuff.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/broker-640x201.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px"/></figure>
<p>A broker acts as an intermediary. They get you the market rate and take a cut. A broker doesn’t set the rate. The market does. The broker only sets its cut.</p>
<p>A money market fund gets you the market rate on money market securities minus the cut by the fund manager. Some fund managers take a bigger cut than others but the difference between major players is much smaller and more stable than the difference between rates offered by different banks and credit unions. If you use a money market fund with the smallest cut, such as one from Vanguard, you almost guarantee you’ll have the best rate in a money market fund at all times.</p>
<p>You still pay a “familiarity penalty” when you use a money market fund from Fidelity or Schwab versus one from Vanguard but the difference is in the 0.2%-0.3% range whereas the “familiarity penalty” in bank savings accounts can be more than 1%. The “familiarity penalty” is zero or negligible in buying Treasuries through Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard.</p>
<p>Treasuries don’t trick you into renewing at a bad rate. They automatically pay out at maturity. You’ll get the market rate when you buy again. If the broker offers the “auto roll” feature and you enable it at your choice, your Treasuries will automatically renew at the market rate. You can rest assured that you won’t be cheated.</p>
<p>Money market funds and Treasuries paid very little when the Fed kept interest rates at zero and ran several rounds of Quantitative Easing a few years ago. That wasn’t money market funds’ fault or brokers’ fault. Those were the market rates at that time. Like investing in index funds, you give up the dream of “beating the market” when you put your money in money market funds and Treasuries but you also consistently get the market rates at all times. It doesn’t require keeping your guard up, monitoring carefully, or jumping.</p>
<p>If you want to consistently earn a good yield with low maintenance, ditch banks and credit unions. If you normally keep money in a savings account at a bank or a credit union, put the money in a money market fund at a broker. Here are some choices at Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab:</p>

<p>If you normally buy a CD from a bank or a credit union, buy a Treasury of the same term at Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. See <a href="https://thefinancebuff.com/treasury-bills-cd-money-market.html">How To Buy Treasury Bills &amp; Notes Without Fee at Online Brokers</a> and <a href="https://thefinancebuff.com/buy-treasury-secondary-market.html">How to Buy Treasury Bills &amp; Notes On the Secondary Market</a>.</p>
<p>I used to have many accounts with banks and credit unions. I have only $60 in bank accounts now. My cash is in money market funds and Treasuries in a Fidelity brokerage account. Credit card bills automatically debit Fidelity on the due date. Fidelity automatically sells a money market fund to cover the debits. See <a href="https://thefinancebuff.com/fidelity-cash-management-checking-savings.html">2 Ways to Use Fidelity as a Bank Account</a>.</p>
<p>The Fed has signaled that they may lower interest rates soon. I don’t think they will cut rates all the way back to zero again. If one day banks and credit unions start paying more on their savings accounts and CDs than money market funds and Treasuries, which I doubt will happen, I will still stick to money market funds and Treasuries because I like the transparency and fairness. I’d rather get the market rate at all times than count on the benevolence of a bank or a credit union.</p>
