    <h1>Tell HN: Instagram&#39;s API has broken, support tickets ignored, status page green</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Meta offers an OAuth based API for Instagram.
Many companies and tools are built on and rely on this API for their product &amp; daily operations.</p><p>Beginning Friday evening (US time), a critical endpoint in this API has broken. The endpoint creates long-lived access tokens, so it is in the critical path for almost any company using the API.</p><p>I find it disappointing that a leading technological company does not acknowledge a bug that&#39;s been reported to them several times more than 24 hours ago, even if to say that&#39;s it&#39;s being investigated.</p><p>The endpoint: 
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/guides/long-lived-access-tokens#get-a-long-lived-token</p><p>Currently the API returns a Bad Request with a wrong error message (the endpoint should support &#34;GET&#34;):
```
{
  &#34;message&#34;: &#34;Unsupported request - method type: get&#34;,
  &#34;type&#34;: &#34;IGApiException&#34;,
  &#34;code&#34;: 100,
  &#34;fbtrace_id&#34;: &#34;AuDYqK74IrT9Yt2Sx51UlP6&#34;
}
```</p><p>I have opened a bug report but received no response.
Facebook&#39;s status page shows all green in the API section: https://metastatus.com/
There are several Meta Developers Community threads with no response</p></div></div></div>
