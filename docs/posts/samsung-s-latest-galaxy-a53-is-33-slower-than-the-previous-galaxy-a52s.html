        <p>Samsung’s newly announced <a href="https://www.comparedial.com/samsung-galaxy-a53-deals">Galaxy A53</a> has launched, touted as a moderate upgrade to the best selling Galaxy A52s.</p>
<p>However, one area that doesn’t see an upgrade is performance. In fact, it’s actually a considerable downgrade - at least according to the latest Geekbench scores.</p>
<p>Although single-core performance appears more or less the same at around 700, multi-core performance tells an entirely different story, with benchmarks showing a score that is a whopping 33% lower.</p>
<p>The Galaxy A52s scored comfortably at around <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=SM-A528B">2500</a> for multi-core performance, whereas the new Galaxy A53 struggles to maintain a score of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=sm-a536u">1800</a>. Such a drop in performance is almost unheard of, particularly for a successor to one of the best selling phones worldwide.</p>
<p>The drop in performance is most likely due to <a href="https://www.comparedial.com/samsung-galaxy-deals">Samsung</a> switching to their own proprietary chip. The <a href="https://www.comparedial.com/samsung-galaxy-a52s-5g-deals">Galaxy A52s</a> uses the Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G chip, whereas the new <a href="https://www.comparedial.com/samsung-galaxy-a53-deals">Galaxy A53</a> comes with the Samsung Exynos 1280 processor.</p>

<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-a/galaxy-a53-5g-awesome-blue-128gb-sm-a536blbneub/">Samsung’s own website</a>, the Galaxy A53 is advertised as ‘up to 6% faster core performance, 33% faster graphic performance and 43% faster neural performance’. However, a small asterix states this is with the older Galaxy A52 5G model, which uses the Snapdragon 750G chip.</p>
<p>For a long time, it’s been clear Samsung have struggled to keep up with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon offerings. This has been very apparent with the flagship <a href="https://www.comparedial.com/samsung-galaxy-deals">Galaxy S</a> series, where the European models always perform worse with an Exynos chip, compared to the faster US and international models with a Snapdragon chip.</p>
<p>The reason for ditching Snapdragon is unclear. However, by using their own chips, Samsung will likely be saving a considerable amount of money, as opposed to buying chips from Qualcomm.</p>
