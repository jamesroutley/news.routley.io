    <h1>Rickroll meme immortalized in custom ASIC that includes 164 hardcoded programs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>An ASIC designed to display the infamous Rickroll meme is here, alongside 164 other assorted functions.</p>
<p>The project is a product of Matthew Venn&#39;s <a href="https://zerotoasiccourse.com/" rel="nofollow">Zero to ASIC Course</a>, which offers prospective chip engineers the chance to &#34;learn to design your own ASIC and get it fabricated.&#34; Since 2020, Zero to ASIC has accepted several designs that are incorporated into a single chip called a multi-project wafer (MPW), a cost-saving measure as making one chip for one design would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>Zero to ASIC has two series of chips: MPW and Tiny Tapeout. The MPW series usually includes just a handful of designs, such as the four on MPW8 <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://zerotoasiccourse.com/post/mpw8_submitted/">submitted</a> in January 2023. By contrast, the original Tiny Tapeout chip included <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt01/">152 designs</a>, and Tiny Tapeout 2 (which arrived last October) had 165, though could bumped up to 250.</p>

    

<p>Of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/">the 165 designs</a>, one in particular may strike a chord: Design 145, or <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/145/">the Secret File</a>, made by engineer and YouTuber Bitluni. His Secret File <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/bitluni/tt02-SecretFile">design</a> for the Tiny Tapeout ASIC is designed to play a small part of Rick Astley&#39;s music video for Never Gonna Give You Up, also known as the Rickroll meme.</p>

        


        

<p>Bitluni was a late inclusion on the Tiny Tapeout 2 project, having been invited just three days before the submission deadline. He initially just made a persistence-of-vision controller, which was revised twice for a total of three designs.</p>
<p>&#34;At the end, I still had a few hours left, and I thought maybe I should also upload a meme project,&#34; Bitluni says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdF_nzMW_i8" rel="nofollow">in his video</a> documenting his ASIC journey. His meme of choice was of course the Rickroll. One might even call it an Easter egg.</p>

        

<p>However, given that there were 250 total plots for each design, there wasn&#39;t a ton of room for both the graphics processor and the file it was supposed to render, a short GIF of the music video. Ultimately, this had to be shrunk from 217 kilobytes to less than half a kilobyte, making its output look similar to games on the Atari 2600 from 1977.</p>

</ul>
<p>Accessing the Rickroll rendering processor and other designs isn&#39;t simple. Bitluni created a custom circuit board to mount the Tiny Tapeout 2 chip, creating a device that could then be plugged into a motherboard capable of selecting specific designs on the ASIC. Unfortunately for Bitluni, his first PCB had a design error on it that he had to correct, but the revised version worked and was able to display the Rickroll GIF in hardware via a VGA port.</p>
<p>Other designs in Tiny Tapeout 2 include an FPGA, a 4-bit CPU, and a calculator that estimates pi to 1,000 decimal places. The chip is fabricated by Efabless&#39;s ChipIgnite shuttle program using the Skywater 130nm open source PDK.</p>
<p>While there&#39;s no serious practical functionality for any of these designs, they can serve as useful proofs of concept for aspiring chip designers who want to see their designs on real silicon. It&#39;s very expensive to fab a single wafer of chips, and far out of reach for the average student or hobbyist to do so.</p>
<p>Though, even with what is essentially crowdfunding, the minimum buy-in cost for the Zero to ASIC course is $650, far more expensive than $100 FPGAs that are capable of being programmed to do far more complicated things. That&#39;s certainly a big premium just so a chip can be considered custom-made.</p>

        

<p>It&#39;s also worth pointing out that the submitted designs themselves are open source and can be inspected by anyone, which means those of you interested in the low-level design of chips and hardware languages can dive in and check it all out.</p>
<p>While Tiny Tapeout 2 has only just arrived, its successors are already well underway. In fact, Tiny Tapeout 3 to 6 have already closed submissions, and all are expected to arrive over the course of the year. Submissions for Tiny Tapeout 7, 8, and 9 are open, with Tiny Tapeout 7 slated for a December launch, and 8 and 9 for mid-2025.</p>
<p>Since the submissions for Tiny Tapeout are publicly available, we can see <a href="https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt03/" rel="nofollow">Tiny Tapeout 3</a> won&#39;t be free of memes either. Design 16, Bad Apple, plays the Touhou-based Bad Apple song over a piezo speaker, and design 77 is an AI decelerator that is &#34;guaranteed to slow down your AI model training.&#34; Tiny Tapeout 2&#39;s Rickroll design is also ported over to Tiny Tapeout 3.
