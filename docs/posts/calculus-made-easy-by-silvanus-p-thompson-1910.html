<p>
	I read &#34;Calculus Made Easy&#34; by Silvanus P. Thompson and it&#39;s still to this day my inspiration for explaining complex technical topics to lay people. It&#39;s a fantastic book, and even if you know math you <em>must</em> read it if you want to understand how to teach complexity to others. <small><em><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1299805">(source)</a></em></small>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
	Thompson creates a warm, inviting environment where students will learn and grasp the true essence of calculus without any added fluff or overt technicality. <small><em><a href="http://mathblog.com/mathematics-books/">(source)</a></em></small>

    <p>
	      Most college calculus texts weigh a ton; this one does not â€” it just gets to the point. This is how I learned calculus: my uncle gave me a copy. <small><em><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home//baez/books.html">(source)</a></em></small>
