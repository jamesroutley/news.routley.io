    <h1>Oblique Strategies on GameBoy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Oblique Strategies is a deck of cards designed to help artists break up an art block. Each of the 100+ cards contain a possible action to take or a new way of thinking about a creative problem. They were created by artists Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt in the 70s and have been updated with various new editions over the years.<br/></p>
<p><strong>This is a port of that deck of cards for Game Boy, for some reason.</strong><br/></p>
<p> It was made by me, Nicky Flowers, as a way to learn how GB Studio works. Turns out it works pretty well! I boot up the ROM on my DMG when I get stuck working on music or coding or really anything where I&#39;m creating stuff. I hope you might find it useful too! <br/></p>
<p><strong>Also available for download is a version for Analogue Pocket systems!! Wowee!!!Â </strong></p>
<p>I was tempted to add a cool chiptune soundtrack but I found it to be distracting when I was working on something with audio. That&#39;ll just have to wait for my next homebrew software &gt;:)</p>
<p>I&#39;m not officially associated with Brian Eno or anything (that would be cool lol), but if you want the real thing, you can get it directly from him! I don&#39;t think my version has all the cards this 5th edition printing does. <a href="https://www.enoshop.co.uk/product/oblique-strategies?filter=Oblique%20Strategies" referrerpolicy="origin" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.enoshop.co.uk/product/oblique-strategies?filter=Oblique%20Strategies</a></p><p>If you really love what I did here, you can donate to my ko-fi with a nice message :) <a href="https://ko-fi.com/nickyflowers" referrerpolicy="origin" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ko-fi.com/nickyflowers</a><br/></p></div></div>
