                <p>With the autumn vaccination programme, we aim to prevent serious illness, hospitalisation and death. The risk of becoming severely ill from covid-19 increases with age. Therefore, people who have reached the age of 50 and particularly vulnerable people will be offered vaccination. We expect that many people will be infected with covid-19 during autumn and winter. It is therefore important that the population remembers the guidance on how to prevent infection, which also applies to a number of other infectious diseases.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sst.dk/en/English/Corona-eng/Prevent-infection">See the guidance here: Prevent being infected with covid-19</a></p>
<p>On this page, you can read who will be offered vaccination, which vaccines we plan to use and when the programme will begin.</p>

                We have achieved very high population immunity in Denmark. This is due both to the high adherence to the vaccination programme and to many people previously having been infected with covid-19. However, we expect that this immunity will gradually decrease over time. In addition, we know that covid-19 is a seasonal disease and that the number of infections are expected to increase during autumn and winter. We expect that a large part of the population will become infected with covid-19 during the autumn, and we therefore want to vaccinate those having the highest risk so that they are protected from severe illness if they become infected.

                <p>If you are offered vaccination based on your age, you will receive an invitation in e-Boks/mit.dk. You will be offered vaccination against covid-19, influenza and pneumococci. For nursing home residents, there will be a special offer of local vaccination without appointment.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, who can set up a vaccination process at vacciner.dk for you with the vaccines you are offered. You can then book an appointment yourself. In some cases, your doctor will be able to vaccinate you immediately.</p>
<p>Check whether your workplace offers vaccination because you are a healthcare professional or elderly care worker or work in selected parts of the social services sector.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Children and adolescents rarely become severely ill from the Omicron variant of covid-19.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2022, it was no longer possible for children and adolescents aged under 18 to get the first injection and, from 1 September 2022, it was no longer possible for them to get the second injection.</p>

<p>A very limited number of children at particularly higher risk of becoming severely ill will still be offered vaccination based on an individual assessment by a doctor.</p>
