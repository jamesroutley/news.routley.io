    <h1>EEG Cat Ears</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Once I had the ears mounted, it was time to design the animation. In order to do that, I first had to simulate the input from the MindWave headset, since that is what would control the animation in production.</p><p>The MindWave EEG headset sends a number of variables via serial: a value for each brainwave type (alpha, beta, gamma, etc.), and two &#34;interpreted&#34; variables, which are composited from the raw brainwave measurements by the <em>TGAM</em> chip embedded in the headset.</p><p>These values are &#34;Attention&#34;, and &#34;Meditation&#34;. Each is an integer value from 0 to 100. </p><p>Attention is a measure of focus. The more you concentrate, the higher the variable. </p><p>Meditation is a measure of mental relaxation. Calm your mind, and the variable value increases.</p><p>The two variables work together: it is possible to have a very high attention along with a high meditation value. </p><p>For the purposes of this experimental project, I chose to focus on animating the ears based on attention. So I put together a breadboard circuit (shown below) with a potentiometer attached to the Arduino&#39;s analog input, which returned a variable ranging from 0 to 1023. I used the<em> map()</em> function to scale that from 1 to 100, and stored that as my <em>attention</em> variable. </p><p>So, by turning the knob on my breadboard, I could simulate the input from a MindWave EEG headset, and start writing code to animate the movement of the ears based on that input. </p></div></div>
