        so, you want to know about program synthesis? Recently (as of 2022), the topic of “building AI to write code” has become fashionable in both industry and academia, with copilot...

        As Leslie puts it, you must define the problem first before solving it. This post is about how to define and analyze a typical synthesis problem, along with a naive...

        With infinite compute, program synthesis is trivial – iterate through all programs for one that works. In practice, we need to find a working program with as few samples as...

        A program-writer is a conduit between specifications and programs. In this post, we will explain how large language models (llm) can be an universal program-writer for different domains. a menagerie...
