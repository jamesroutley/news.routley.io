    <h1>My cheapskate commenting system</h1>

        <p>My blog now has comments! Well, <em>kind of</em>…</p>

<p>I went down a two day long rabbit-hole trying to find the best solution for implementing comments on my static website (generated via Jekyll FYI). There are a ton of options out there and many open source models that allow you to spin up your own instance with something like DigitalOcean or AWS. But I’m a cheap bastard. I refuse to spend $5/month on a blog mostly used for fun and one that I have zero incentive to “monetize”.</p>

<p>So, what <em>free</em> options did this old miser have left to chose from? To my surprise, there were two solid options that initially caught my eye! Let’s take a look then, shall we?</p>



<p>Overall I don’t have many bad things to say about <a href="https://www.remarkbox.com">Remarkbox</a>. It looks nice, is easy to implement and runs a “pay what you can” pricing model. What more could you ask for?! The major issue (for me, <em>personally</em>) is precisely <strong>that</strong>; the free model. This makes it difficult for me to trust 100% that this system will still be around in 3-4 years. Now I know - even paid systems can shutdown unexpectedly, but I find free tier options end up shutting their doors sooner. There is an option to self-host Remarkbox, but that requires a yearly license and also comes back to the point I made about not wanting to pay for hosting…</p>

<h2 id="utterances-github-based">Utterances (Github-based)</h2>

<p>The other major option was <a href="https://utteranc.es">Utterances</a>. This system was almost the winner due to it’s pretty great feature set:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open source</li>
  <li>No tracking, no ads</li>
  <li>All data stored in GitHub issues</li>
  <li>Free!</li>
</ol>

<p>But take a look above at point number three. The fact that readers wishing to leave a comment are <strong>required to have a Github account</strong>. For me, this is a non-starter. I don’t want to force my audience to sign up for or sign in to <em>any</em> account just to leave a simple comment on my humble blog. Considering a number of my readers are part of the FOSS community, this just seemed like a bad fit.</p>

<h2 id="finding-inspiration">Finding Inspiration</h2>

<p>I absolutely love the <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com">solar.lowtechmagazine.com</a> website (both for it’s content and design) and indirectly found my comment system inspiration there. Okay let’s be honest, I completely stole their commenting system “concept”. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, right?</p>



<p>E-mail. It’s just <strong>plain e-mail</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve setup a basic <code>comment-prompt.html</code> in my <code>_includes</code> folder that contains a <code>mailto</code> action button<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:myemail.com?subject=RE: { { page.title | uri_escape } }&#34;&gt;
    &lt;button&gt;Comment via email&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This include template is placed at the bottom of every article automatically. Then, that action pulls in the article’s title as the e-mail subject line in the user’s default mailing app. That’s it.</p>

<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>

<ul>
  <li>No third party application needed</li>
  <li>Privacy focused</li>
  <li>More direct interaction with my audience/readers</li>
  <li>Builds a much more close-knit community</li>
  <li>Completely free!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Must be manually curated and posted</li>
  <li>No notifications</li>
  <li>No “built-in” reply functionality</li>
  <li>Has the potential to become unwieldy…</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fun-experiment">Fun Experiment</h2>

<p>I figure either way, this will be an interesting experiment. I don’t know my audience size (since I don’t use any type of tracking) but I assume it’s very small. Those willing to write me a personal e-mail in order to share their thoughts on my stupid little blog probably have something interesting to say. At least I hope so.</p>

<p>Let’s see how this thing goes…</p>
