The limited hardware offering, unsuitable for data centers, and the maturity of the software ecosystem, presented us with a number of challenges.</p><p>Every aspect of their design, from the initial iterations with suppliers, through the soldering of electronic components, the development of specific firmware, to the manufacture of the enclosures using 3D printing, bears witness to an iterative, artisanal approach.</p><p>Our goal was to offer you as soon as possible a range of RISC-V servers meticulously designed to meet the demands of a cloud environment.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>Scaleway&#39;s EM-RV1 offering marks a turning point in the server industry as the world&#39;s first RISC-V dedicated server offering. This breakthrough testifies to Scaleway&#39;s unwavering commitment to being a leader in technological innovation. By introducing this revolution in the world of processors to the cloud market, Scaleway is positioning itself as an activator of the RISC-V ecosystem, accelerating its development and popularization.</p><p>EM-RV1 servers are more than just an innovation; they represent a bold vision for the future of computing. A vision that advocates the opening up of processor design standards, offering the possibility of the emergence of local players enabling nations to eventually control the manufacture of their processors.</p></div></div></div></div><div><p>From laboratory to production</p></div><div><div><div><div><p>The conclusion of an iterative R&amp;D process in our Paris laboratories, the EM-RV1 is a bold, pragmatic approach to popularizing RISC-V processor architecture by making economical servers immediately available in the cloud.</p><p>Our engineers have worked tirelessly to obtain the best performance and guarantee maximum longevity. Particular attention has been paid to the maintainability of the servers, so as to be able to maintain each server with minimum impact on its neighbors, while maintaining extremely high density.</p><p>As these offers are particularly innovative, pushing back the limits of our know-how in many fields, they induce a degree of unpredictability.
