  <h3>But what is it?</h3>
  <p>The program uses a simple genetic algorithm to evolve random two-wheeled shapes into cars over generations. Loosely
    based on <a href="http://boxcar2d.com/">BoxCar2D</a>, but
    written from scratch, only using the same physics engine (<a href="http://box2d.org/">box2d</a>).</p>


  <h3>Controls</h3>
  <table>
    <tbody><tr>
      <th>Save Population</th>
      <td>Saves current population locally.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Restore Saved Population</th>
      <td>Restore a previously saved population.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Suprise</th>
      <td>Toggles drawing, makes the simulation faster.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>New Population</th>
      <td>Keeps the generated track and restarts the whole car population.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Create new world with seed</th>
      <td>The same seed always creates the same track, so you can agree on a seed with your friends
        and compete. :)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Mutation rate</th>
      <td>The chance that each gene in each individual will mutate to a random value when a new generation is
        born.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Mutation size</th>
      <td>The range each gene can mutate into. Lower numbers mean the gene will have values closer to the
        original.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Elite clones</th>
      <td>The top n cars that will be copied over to the next generation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>View top replay</th>
      <td>Pause the current simulation and show the top performing car. Click a second time to resume
        simulation.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>

  <h3>Graph</h3>
  <table>
    <tbody><tr>
      <th>Red</th>
      <td>Top score in each generation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Green</th>
      <td>Average of the top 10 cars in each generation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Blue</th>
      <td>Average of the entire generation</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>

  <h3>Genome</h3>
  <p>
    The genome consists of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shape (8 genes, 1 per vertex)</li>
    <li>Wheel size (2 genes, 1 per wheel)</li>
    <li>Wheel position (2 genes, 1 per wheel)</li>
    <li>Wheel density (2 genes, 1 per wheel) darker wheels mean denser wheels</li>
    <li>Chassis density (1 gene) darker body means denser chassis</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Blurb</h3>
  <p>This is not as deterministic as it should be, so your best car may not perform as well as it once did. The terrain
    gets more complex with distance.</p>

  <h3>GitHub</h3>
  <p>The code is now on a <a href="https://github.com/red42/HTML5_Genetic_Cars">GitHub repository</a>. Feel free to
    contribute!</p>
