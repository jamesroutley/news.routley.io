    <h1>A Man with an Impossible Memory</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>On an April afternoon in 1929, a timid-looking man with a broad face
appeared at Moscow’s Academy of Communist Education and asked to see a
memory specialist. The man, who would become known in the psychological
literature as S., had been sent by his boss, a section editor at a
Moscow newspaper where S. was a reporter. That morning, the editor had
noticed that S. did not take any notes when the daily assignments were
made. When he confronted S. about this, S. explained that he didn’t need
to write anything down; he simply remembered. The editor picked up a
newspaper and read at length from it, challenging S. to repeat
everything back to him. When S. did so verbatim, the editor sent him to
have his head examined.</p><p>The researcher who met with S. that day was twenty-seven-year-old
Alexander Luria, whose fame as a founder of neuropsychology still lay
before him. Luria began reeling off lists of random numbers and words
and asking S. to repeat them, which he did, in ever-lengthening series.
Even more remarkably, when Luria retested S. more than fifteen years
later, he found those numbers and words still preserved in S.’s memory.
“I simply had to admit that the capacity of his memory had <em>no distinct
limits</em>,” Luria writes in his famous case study of S., “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Mnemonist-Little-about-Memory/dp/0674576225" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Mnemonist-Little-about-Memory/dp/0674576225&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Mnemonist-Little-about-Memory/dp/0674576225" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Mind of a
Mnemonist</a>,”
published in 1968 in both Russian and English. In the book, Luria
describes how S., desperate to purge his mind of unwanted recollections,
turned to writing down everything he wanted to forget on slips of paper,
in the hope that he might somehow offload these memories. When this
failed, he lit the slips of paper on fire and watched them burn to ash,
also to no avail.</p><p>Luria’s monograph became a psychology classic both in Russia and abroad,
and it had considerable influence over the nascent field of memory
studies. S.’s case became a parable about the pitfalls of flawless
recall. Luria catalogues various difficulties that S. experienced
navigating everyday life, linking them to profound deficits he
identified in S.’s ability to conceive the world in abstract terms.
These cognitive deficiencies, Luria suggests, were related to S.’s
extraordinary episodic memory—the memory we have for personal
experiences, as opposed to semantic memory (which tells us, for
instance, that the dromedary has only one hump). Deriving meaning from
the world requires us to relinquish some of its texture. S.’s case, as
many readers have noted, resembles the Jorge Luis Borges story “Funes
the Memorious,” a fictional work about a man plagued by the persistence
of his memory. “To think is to forget a difference, to generalize, to
abstract,” Borges writes. “In the overly replete world of Funes there
were nothing but details, almost contiguous details.” Similarly, Luria
writes that for S., almost every word, every thought, was freighted with
excessive detail. When he heard “restaurant,” for example, he would
picture an entrance, customers, a Romanian orchestra tuning up to play
for them, and so on. Like Funes, S. had a sort of private language to
catalogue the richness of his mental associations. The word for “roach”
in Yiddish could also mean, in his mind, a dent in a metal chamber pot,
a crust of black bread, and the light cast by a lamp that fails to push
back all the darkness in a room.</p><p>With its richly descriptive prose, Luria’s case study reads as a
literary work as much as a psychological monograph. Luria wanted to
discover not so much what S. was like but, to repurpose the philosopher
Thomas Nagel’s famous formulation about a bat, to discover what it was
like for S. to be S. He quotes long passages from their interviews and
correspondence, and the two voices—Luria, measured and thoughtful; S.,
exuberant, full of almost hallucinatory imagery—intermingle on the page,
offering glimpses of a strange inner landscape. Luria is more reticent
when it comes to the outer world of the man he studied for nearly three
decades. He offers only the barest of biography, and never identifies S.
by his real name in the book—even though S. had been dead for a decade
when Luria published his study and his memory feats were already well
known in the U.S.S.R. Exactly how S. died, or what he was doing in his
later years, Luria doesn’t say. Some sources have him spending his
sunset years as a Moscow cabbie, ferrying passengers around without need
for a map, while others assert that he went insane and ended up in an
asylum, unable to distinguish the present from the ever-living past of
his memory. Neither, it turns out, is true.</p><p>For years now, since first reading Luria’s book as an undergraduate
studying Russian, then after encountering it again as a research
assistant in a memory lab, I’ve searched, on odd weekends and nights,
for what information I could find about S., whose real name was Solomon
Shereshevsky. Eventually, I tracked down a relative. Then, more
recently, I got hold of a small, blue school notebook, preserved by
Luria’s grandniece in the psychologist’s archives. It contains
Shereshevsky’s own handwritten autobiographical account of how he became
a mnemonist. Written not long before his death and left incomplete, it
opens with his impressions of that first meeting with Luria twenty-eight
years earlier. It even provides the exact list of things Luria gave him
to memorize that day.</p><p>My search for Solomon Shereshevsky revealed a person who fit uneasily in
the story of the Man Who Could Not Forget, as he has so often been
portrayed. He did not, in fact, have perfect recall. His past was not a
land he could wander through at will. For him, remembering took
conscious effort and a certain creative genius. He was not a
photographer, I’ve come to think, so much as an artist—a person who
painted not from memory but <em>with</em> memory, combining and recombining his
colors to make worlds only he could see. His extraordinary case also
reveals something of how our ordinary minds remember, and how often they
do not.</p><p>Shereshevsky’s own account of his life as a mnemonist diverges from
Luria’s on its very first page. He dates their meeting to April 13,
1929, while Luria has it occurring a few years before, and Shereshevsky
gives his age at the time as thirty-seven, while Luria asserts that his
subject was still in his twenties. According to Shereshevsky, he
returned to the newspaper that day and told his editor that his memory
had been tested and was found to exceed the bounds of what was believed
to be physically possible. Hearing this, the editor convinced him to
give up writing—at that time, Shereshevsky’s specialty was brief
satirical pieces that, in the early years of Stalin’s rule, had fallen
from favor—and instead devote himself to performing full time as a
professional mnemonist. In short order, he hired a circus trainer as his
manager and travelling assistant and was coached by a carnival juggler
on how to entertain. Then he set off for the provinces.</p><p>Mikhail Reynberg attended one of Shereshevsky’s performances in a small
town outside Moscow. For Reynberg, S. was simply Uncle Solomon. I
tracked him down through a contact in Moscow and went to see him a few
years ago on a hot summer afternoon in Brooklyn, where he now lives. His
apartment was a rambling series of neatly kept rooms that had an
unmistakably Russian feel to them, from the beaded hallway curtain to
the feast of delicious <em>zakuski</em> that had been laid out for my arrival.
Reynberg is stocky, with a head of neatly combed ivory hair, and we sat
for hours in the kitchen, talking about his uncle. In that town outside
Moscow, he said, the farmers who were supposed to meet him and his uncle
at the train station never showed up, so they hired horse-drawn sledges
to take them through the snow to find the venue on their own. When they
arrived, the organizers had set up the chalkboard for Shereshevsky’s
performance, but then had broken into the refreshments meant for the
reception and had gotten drunk. Uninterested in testing the limits of
the mnemonist’s mind, the villagers instead convinced their visitors to
join them around the table and continue drinking. The actual performance
never happened, but they paid him nonetheless—in potatoes, Reynberg
recalled, for which his uncle was grateful.</p><p>Like food, housing was in short supply in those years. In Moscow,
Shereshevsky lived with his wife and son in a damp room in the basement
of a janitorial outbuilding tucked away in a courtyard. It was a trying
situation for them all, but perhaps especially for Shereshevsky’s wife,
Aida. A graduate of the famous Smolny Institute for Noble Maidens,
Aida was a talented musician who kept her own piano in their cramped
quarters. During spells of fine weather, husband and wife wheeled the
instrument out into the courtyard to let it dry out. There was
something striking about this incongruous image: the two of them
trundling the heavy piano to a sunny spot in the courtyard, each bump
calling forth dim polychromatic echoes from inside its wooden body.</p><p>Reynberg insisted that Shereshevsky’s lot in life was not merely bad
luck but the result of an orchestrated campaign of intimidation.
According to Reynberg, Shereshevsky was pressured to put his talents to
work for the secret police, but he declined. His problems deepened after
the Second World War, Reynberg said, during the so-called
anti-cosmopolitanism campaign, a purge directed primarily at Jews.
(Luria, by then a well-known psychologist, was hounded from his job at
the Institute of Neurosurgery, and, according to his daughter’s family
memoirs, kept a suitcase packed and ready for his potential arrest.)
Shereshevsky found himself increasingly shunned, his shows cancelled.
Reynberg told me that the secret police planted provocateurs in
Shereshevsky’s audiences, some of whom heckled and whistled at him in
order to distract him from his routine. After a disastrous performance
that left audience members clamoring for a refund, his career was
essentially finished. That career neatly overlapped with Stalin’s rule,
spanning several waves of mass arrests. Hundreds of thousands, even
millions, vanished into the maw of the camps; disgraced public figures
were literally airbrushed from the record; the dead and disappeared were
purged not just from life but from the nation’s collective memory.
Shereshevsky had made a living off his memory in a land ruled by
amnesia.</p><p>Something else I learned that afternoon threatened to change my entire
sense of who Shereshevsky was: His uncle, Reynberg said, could be
forgetful. If he didn’t consciously try to commit something to memory,
he didn’t always recall it later. I had imagined, based on Luria’s case
study and the mythology that had grown up around it, a Soviet Funes,
with flawless and involuntary recollection of his past. Reynberg told me
that his uncle trained hours a day for his evening performances. Was he
a mere showman after all?</p><p>As described by Luria, some of Shereshevsky’s mental operations bear a
strong resemblance to the sort of garden-variety mnemonic tricks that
have been known for many centuries—for example, the “memory palace,” or
“method of loci,” in which an imagined physical space is used to
organize information in its proper sequence. In Shereshevsky’s version
of this device, he would imagine Gorky Street, Moscow’s main
thoroughfare, or a village street from his childhood, mentally
distributing what he wanted to remember along its length, often creating
an impromptu story out of the sequence, then strolling back through
later to recollect (re-collect) these items in his mind. It’s a
technique that nearly anyone can learn; in his book “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Moonwalking with
Einstein</a>,”
the writer Joshua Foer describes using this technique to win at the
U.S.A. Memory Championship. Luria doesn’t deny Shereshevsky’s use of
mnemonic devices, but he maintains that these came later, and that they
merely complemented Shereshevsky’s immense natural abilities.</p></div></div></div></div>
