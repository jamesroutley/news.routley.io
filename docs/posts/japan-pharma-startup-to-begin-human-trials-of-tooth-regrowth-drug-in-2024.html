    <h1>Japan pharma startup to begin human trials of tooth regrowth drug in 2024</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>A team of scientists led by a Japanese pharmaceutical startup has been working on a drug to stimulate the growth of new teeth in what would be a world-first, aiming to put it on the market by around 2030.</p>
<p>Toregem Biopharma Co., funded by Kyoto University, is expected to begin clinical trials on healthy adults in around July 2024 to confirm the drug&#39;s safety, after the team succeeded in growing new teeth in mice in 2018.</p>
<p>Most people have &#34;tooth buds&#34; that have the potential to become a new tooth, in addition to baby and permanent teeth, although the buds usually do not develop and subsequently disappear.</p>

<p>The team created an antibody drug that inhibits the protein that suppresses the growth of teeth. The drug works on these buds and stimulates their growth.</p>
<p>In 2018, the team also administered the drug to ferrets, which have both baby and permanent teeth similar to humans, and new teeth grew.</p>
<p>The team plans to hold a clinical trial for the drug from 2025 for children between 2 to 6 years old with anodontia who are born without some or all permanent teeth. The children will be injected with one dose to induce their teeth growth.</p>
<p>There are also hopes to utilize the drug in the future for adults who have lost teeth due to cavities.</p>
<p>&#34;Missing teeth in a child can affect the development of their jaw bone,&#34; said Katsu Takahashi, co-founder of Toregem Biopharma and head of dentistry and oral surgery at Kitano Hospital in Osaka.</p>
<p>&#34;We hope the drug will serve as a key to solving those problems,&#34; he said.</p>
