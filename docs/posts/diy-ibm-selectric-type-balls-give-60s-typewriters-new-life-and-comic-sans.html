<p>There are some feelings you just can&#39;t re-create. And to IBM Selectric loyalists, neither <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/IBM_Beam_Spring_Keyboards">beam spring keyboards</a> nor <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/new-buckling-spring-keyboards-recreate-ibms-iconic-model-f-for-modern-computers/">buckling spring</a> designs nor a modern<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/the-best-wireless-mechanical-keyboards/"> mechanical keyboard</a> can replicate the distinct feel driven by that legendary type ball. In the &#39;60s and &#39;70s, the Selectric was an office staple, but the growth of PCs and <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/daisy-wheel-printer.htm">daisy wheels</a> forced the machine into retirement by 1986. That hasn&#39;t stopped people from buying, restoring, and <a href="https://www.ibmtypewriters.com/reconselectric.htm">selling</a> Selectrics, though. The problem is, IBM stopped making the single printing element that makes those typewriters so special. You can find the type balls online, (including options claiming to be <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/225112244178">used</a> and <a href="https://typewriters.com/parts/1167-new-genuine-ibm-selectric-ii-element-many-styles-available/">never used</a>) and at stores carrying old electronic components. But you&#39;d save time and resources if you could make your own. It took years for someone to find a way to make the Selectric golf ball 3D-printable, but now someone claims they have.</p>
<p>A tinkerer named Sam Ettinger recently shared his Selectric type ball 3D-printing project on <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/190389-3d-printed-selectric-typeballs">Hackaday</a> and <a href="https://github.com/settinger/selectric_typeballs">Github </a>and shared the files on <a href="https://www.printables.com/@settinger_263029">Printables</a>, as reported by <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/04/11/ibm-selectric-typewriters-finally-get-diy-typeballs/"><span>Hackaday</span></a>. But beware: These finalized versions haven&#39;t been tested or printed by their creator. Earlier this month, Ettinger shared a video on <a href="https://indieweb.social/@settinger/110126883866596694">Mastodon</a> of the prior version in action, admitting that some letters weren&#39;t usable.</p>

<p>The new models are reportedly 0.2 mm shorter to address this and adjust the letter rotation, since it was &#34;90 degrees off.&#34; Because of this, we can&#39;t verify how successful these models would be in real use.</p>
<h2>Comic Sans and more</h2>

<p>Besides eliminating jammed keys by moving from old-school typewriters&#39; type bars, one of Selectric typewriters&#39; niftiest features was the ability to swap out golf balls and change the typewriters&#39; typefaces and languages, from international languages to the APL programming language and scientific notation (if you need more help understanding why people are still hooked on Selectrics, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJITkKaO0qA">this YouTube video</a> from keyboard enthusiast Chyrosran22 may help).</p>

<p>Ettinger&#39;s type balls follow this same spirit by offering <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/441233-comic-sans-typeball-for-the-ibm-selectric-typewrit">Comic Sans</a> (drawing from Jesse England&#39;s <a href="http://www.jesseengland.net/project/sincerity-machine-the-comic-sans-typewriter/">2014 Comic Sans typewriter</a>), as well as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboards/kbdtifi2">Windows&#39; Tifinagh keyboard layout</a> in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/ebrima">Ebrima</a> typeface and Windows&#39; <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-tw/globalization/keyboards/kbdcher.html">Cherokee Nation keyboard layout</a> in the <a href="https://www.languagegeek.com/font/Cherokee/digohweli.html">Digohweli </a>typeface. Each ball requires a &#34;bent wire,&#34; the Printables pages say, or Selectric ball clip, for which designs are also available via <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/416841-selectric-ball-clip">Printables</a>, in order to work.</p>
<h2>Building on earlier work</h2>
<p>Ettinger thinks these DIY golf balls improve on earlier attempts, attributing thanks to the work of <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4126040">Steve Malikoff</a>, which made an ambitious, but flawed, DIY-type ball using OpenSCAD. In 2020, Malikoff detailed efforts to 3D-print his type ball with an FDM printer but struggled to make sharp edges on plastic.</p>
<p>Ettinger, turning to the powers of a resin printer, said he changed &#34;most&#34; of Malikoff&#39;s type ball dimensions and how the characters are generated for the automated process.</p>

<p>With its advanced capabilities, from mistake correction to introducing magnetic recording technology (hello, early electronic word processing!), you can&#39;t have a true conversation about how we got to modern computing input without nodding to the Selectric. Those dedicated to the legend may now have a new way to keep their machines alive—or at least handy work to build upon.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing someone print out and test Ettinger&#39;s models to confirm if they do IBM&#39;s machines justice. Even better, people could use Ettinger&#39;s work to create more options for DIY balls, from additional typefaces to more languages and perhaps even better designs. Long live the golf ball.</p>
<p><em>Correction: IBM&#39;s Selectric balls aren&#39;t made of metal. </em></p>
