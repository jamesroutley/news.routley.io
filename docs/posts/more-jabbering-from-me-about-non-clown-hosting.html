    <h1>More jabbering from me about non-clown hosting</h1>
    
    
<p>
Late yesterday, I put up a 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/09/22/colo/">post</a>
about how to get into colocation in about the crappiest way possible.  I 
skipped a bunch of details just to get it out there.  The inspiration 
was based on finding out just how many people have no idea that this 
business model even exists.
</p>
<p>
I used to work in a cousin of this space: managed and dedicated 
hosting, and here&#39;s how this all lined up:
</p>
<p>
Colocation (as mentioned yesterday) gives you some space, some power, 
bandwidth, a network allocation of some kind (and/or ability to route 
your own stuff), and hopefully some decent HVAC to keep everything 
cool.  It&#39;s your hardware in their space, and if something breaks on 
that stuff, you get to fix it.  What if a drive fails?  That&#39;s on you.
Your switch or router goes insane?  Same deal: that&#39;s all you.
</p>
<p>
You might be able to get some &#34;remote hands&#34; service from the 
provider for very simple tasks: reboot something, take a picture of the 
(blue) screen, that kind of thing.  Some also let you pay them to go and 
do other stuff with a higher degree of complexity.  Read the fine print.
</p>
<p>
Managed hosting is where you get access to a box somewhere, and are 
usually given root on it.  You can do about what you want to it, but 
beware of the &#34;spheres of support&#34; as we used to call it - the hosting 
company&#39;s support people will only go so far.  You might want Debian, 
but they only do RHEL.  You get the idea.  You can probably ask them to 
do kernel upgrades, troubleshoot why it&#39;s being slow or seems to be 
down, install and configure certain things for you, and so on.
</p>
<p>
If the hardware fails, that&#39;s on them.  They rip open the box and 
replace the part.  You still have to figure out how to make your stuff 
work before, during, and after the event.  They probably won&#39;t do any 
migrations for you, since everyone&#39;s setup is an odd little snowflake 
and only the customer has any chance of knowing how it all works.
</p>
<p>
Higher-end setups might offer hardware firewalls, load balancers, backup 
solutions, and more.  Now, granted, it&#39;s been almost 20 years since I 
last did this myself - I assume someone&#39;s still doing this somewhere.
</p>
<p>
Dedicated servers are a step down from managed.  You (probably) get root 
on a box somewhere, and you can do a lot of stuff on it.  Outside of the 
absolute bare essentials provided by the hosting company (like a Red 
Hat Network entitlement), they aren&#39;t going to do much for you.  They 
might have rigged up some magic hardware to let you power-cycle what&#39;s 
just a boring old whitebox without explicit out-of-band access.  They 
might also have some netboot magic to let you shunt it into a &#34;repair 
environment&#34; if you really screw things up.
</p>
<p>
All of the servers used for hosting this site were of the &#34;dedicated&#34; 
persuasion initially: first at ServerBeach, then at SoftLayer (which 
became IBM).  The SB machines were relatively crappy whiteboxes shoved 
into a bread rack somewhere, while the SL/IBM stuff was on a Real 
Rackmounted Server with out of band remote access and the whole bit.
They handled the hardware, and I handled the software.
</p>
<p>
I mentioned some of the details
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2023/05/27/newbox/">last year</a>
when departing the IBM shit-show and the Texas shit-show at the same 
time.  This ended the era of dedicated hosting for me and moved me into 
colocation.
</p>
<p>
These days, there&#39;s a cabinet in a nice conditioned space not too far 
away.  I initially parked an old switch in there and a derpy little 
Raspberry Pi, just like yesterday&#39;s post implied.  This was to give me a 
little &#34;platform&#34; while the rest of the stuff happened.  A few days 
later, I got some &#34;real&#34; hardware, hung that in there, and then migrated 
everything to it from the SL/IBM box.
</p>
<p>
That was a bit over a year ago, and things are pretty much unchanged.
This setup should just sit there and run and run and run until something 
breaks beyond that which can be handled in software.  Then I get to 
drive out there and flip some parts around and make it go again.  
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not rocket science.  This way of doing things has always been 
possible.  You don&#39;t have to deal with clown providers pulling the rug  
out from under you.  There are a few dimensions in which the provider 
can mess with me now:
</p>
<p>
1. They could have something terrible happen - think flooding or a fire.  
It could take the whole location offline for an extended period, and it 
could well destroy the equipment inside, such that merely relocating it 
to another spot would not be sufficient to revive things.
</p>
<p>
2. They could decide they&#39;re done with this kind of business model, and 
now they&#39;re going to boot out all of the little people who pay a 
pittance per month.  Maybe they&#39;re going to sell out to the latest clown 
provider who wants to melt the ice caps and drown the polar bears with 
their &#34;AI&#34; crap.  (This would also apply if the private equity vultures 
swoop in and try to hollow the place out before nuking it entirely.)
</p>
<p>
3. They could crank the prices up beyond that which I could afford.
</p>
<p>
4. They could do something that somehow makes the basics incompatible: 
they stop supplying AC power, conditioned air, or IP over Ethernet.  (I 
know, this is ridiculous, but I might as well mention it.)
</p>
<p>
5. They could shack up with some really evil people such that I no 
longer want to do business with them.
</p>
<p>
My responses would be approximately this:
</p>
<p>
1. Acquire some other hardware, install a fresh OS and restore my stuff 
from backups, then park it somewhere else.
</p>
<p>
2, 3, 4, 5. Find a new spot, then schlep the hardware there.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
If this is old hat to you, great!  It means you&#39;re probably a grizzled 
1990s sysadmin just like me, consarn it!  This isn&#39;t for you, then.
</p>
<p>
This is for the newer folks who might not have realized that there&#39;s an 
alternative to paying tribute to one of the three churches of the 
Clown: M, G, or A.  If you want to &#34;get your stuff online&#34;, there are 
other ways... and there always have been!
