    <h1>RC | Batch #2</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I&#39;m attending my second batch at The Recurse Center from Oct 30th to Feb 9th (14w 4d). Here&#39;s a quick reflection on my last batch, and what I plan to accomplish during the next one.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><hr/><p>First of all, if you don&#39;t know what The Recurse Center (RC) is, you should check out their website <a href="https://recurse.com">here</a>, but the TLDR is; It&#39;s a program that provides an environment for curious programmers grow alongside peers in a self-directed manner.</p><p>With that out of the way, the rest should make more sense. :)</p><p>My last batch (Summer 1 &#39;22) was only supposed to be a half-batch (6w), but at the last minute I made the call to extend for the duration of a full batch. Was this the right call? It doesn&#39;t really matter. All I know is that I met more wonderful and inspirational people than I would have otherwise, and I learned more about myself than I would have had I not.</p><p>For the first half of my batch you may refer to my <a href="https://veryth.ink/tags/batch-1">weekly updates</a> I made at the time. But to summarize: I came into the batch wanting to study embedded systems and learn enough to produce a proof-of-concept for an idea I had been rolling around in my head. But due to blockers and a waning interest in the topic I ended up pursuing a deeper familiarity with Rust and dabbling in audio synthesis instead. I had attempted to keep a habit of providing weekly updates as posts here, but I stopped producing those past week 6. The rest I will summarize from the record I kept in the form of daily-ish community check-ins I maintained in RC&#39;s Zulip.</p><p>In the latter half of my batch I made more of a point to try and host more events and in general just socialize more. Sometimes this was good, other times I pushed myself too hard and burnt-out hard. I took on another hobby, 3D-printing, and spent a decent amount of time fabricating mods to improve the printer itself (very meta). I started preparing myself for the job-search post-batch, and I dabbled in basic life simulation by following some guided lessons on the subject. I attempted to get back into embedded systems as the new batch came with renewed interest in the topic, but ultimately I didn&#39;t move much closer to my original goal. I continued to try and finish-up a project that blended my interest in cellular automata and audio synthesis but finished my batch without producing a proof-of-concept.</p><blockquote><p>What&#39;s the difference between batch #1 and batch #2?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This one&#39;s got game-dev.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, that&#39;s right. This time I&#39;m going to make a game. But not by using someone else&#39;s game-engine, uh-uh, that won&#39;t do! I&#39;m going to make my own game-engine, <em>and</em> make a game with it! But why? What motivated me to choose this as my focus for this batch?</p><h2 id="a-little-background">A little background</h2><p>I got into software-development specifically to make games in college. Around that time I had little idea what I intended on doing in life. I had a passing interest in being an artist of some kind, maybe graphic design. At the time I was working on a project with some friends trying to make a game. I was &#34;the art guy&#34;, but on a whim, to help out &#34;the code guy&#34;, I took an iOS development course at my local community college. From then on my eyes were opened to the wonderful world of writing software.</p><p>But over time, I got it in my head that getting into game-development wasn&#39;t the &#34;responsible&#34; thing to do, and that I should prepare myself to write &#34;real&#34; software. There was no single point of origin for these thoughts, a little from a father just wanting the best for his son, a lot from the rumors and reports of terrible working conditions in game-dev studios, etc. But after working for a couple startups as a back-end developer and cosplaying as a front-end web-developer on the side, I feel like I haven&#39;t yet found my niche in this field, the thing that captures my full interest.</p><h2 id="back-to-the-present">Back to the present</h2><p>It&#39;s my intention during this batch that, by fully immersing myself in the art of game-development, I can either finally find something that contains my deepest interests in this field, or I at least find less ground to cover in my continued pursuit! Additionally I intend to keep trying new things in this batch, and to put myself out there more than I have before. I feel this implicit pressure as an alumni to be even more present for my peers than I was last time, to support and learn through teaching. But, I also intend to know my own boundaries. If I spend the majority of my time burning-out and then overcompensating for burning-out, I&#39;m not doing anyone (including myself) any favors.</p><p>This was shorter than I wanted it to be, but I think it fulfills its purpose, and I&#39;m writing this post hours before I officially begin so, I should probably ship it!</p><p>I&#39;ll put in the effort to provide weekly updates for this batch on or by Sunday each week. They&#39;ll be tagged under <a href="https://veryth.ink/tags/batch-2"><code>#batch-2</code></a>, and additionally filed under the <a href="https://veryth.ink/categories/check-in"><code>check-in</code></a> category.</p></section></div>
