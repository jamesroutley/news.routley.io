<p><em>This is a call to open source developers to <strong>not</strong> upload the work of others on GitHub.</em></p>
<h2 id="whats-the-problem-with-github">What’s the problem with GitHub?</h2>
<p>Well, there are <strong>a lot</strong> of problems with GitHub. Here, we will mainly focus on a feature called <em>Copilot</em>, but if you’re interested to learn more about the others, <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/">please visit this page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-copilot">What is Copilot?</h2>
<p>According to GitHub,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question is where does it know how to code? Well, it learns by scanning GitHub repositories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GitHub Copilot is trained on billions of lines of public code. The suggestions it makes to you are adapted to your code, but the processing behind it is ultimately informed by code written by others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that this so-called <em>public code</em> is not always under <em>public</em> domain dedication. Sometimes, the code is licensed under a copyleft license (such as <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPL</a>), which requires any modification of the source code to be redistributed under the same license as the original.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221017081115/https://nitter.net/docsparse/status/1581461734665367554">when Copilot suggests pieces of copylefted code, it doesn’t include any notice of the original author, nor the license</a>. This can lead <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/feb/03/github-copilot-copyleft-gpl/">to some copylefted code being included in proprietary or simply not copylefted projects</a>. And this is a violation of both the license terms and the intellectual proprety of the authors of the original code.</p>
<p>We are tired of this legal abuse and we want to stop right now! Microsoft has been attacking copyleft licensing over the years. In short, we would like to protect our work.</p>
<h2 id="so-just-dont-put-your-code-on-github-whats-the-big-deal">So, just don’t put your code on GitHub, what’s the big deal?</h2>
<p>The issue is bigger than it seems. Even if a project is not hosted on GitHub, other people have the legal right (depending on the license) to redistribute the source code. It means that they have the right to share the code of others on GitHub, as long as they respect the terms of license. This is totally legal. But then, Copilot will be able to analyze the code and violates the license terms, which isn’t.</p>
<p>This is why we ask you, as other developers of the open source community, to not upload our code on GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-a-legal-document">Is this a legal document?</h2>
<p>No, it isn’t. If the project is under an open source license, it means that everyone can share a copy – even on GitHub – of the licensed material under certain conditions. A license restricting this right wouldn’t be open source anymore. However, since GitHub may not respect the terms of licensed code that is hosted on their servers, not uploading the code of others there is, in fact, an ethical choice.</p>
