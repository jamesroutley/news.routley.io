    <h1>North Korean internet downed by suspected cyber attacks</h1>

It is not known how many people there have direct access to the global internet, but estimates generally place the figure at a small fraction of one percent of the population of about 25 million.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Seoul-based NK Pro, a news site that monitors North Korea, reported that log files and network records showed websites on North Korean web domains were largely unreachable because North Korea’s Domain Name System (DNS) stopped communicating the routes that data packets should take.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">A similar incident was observed on Jan. 14, NK Pro reported.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">The simultaneous nature of the server outages suggested a DDoS attack, in which hackers try to flood a network with unusually high volumes of data traffic in order to paralyse it, Ali said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">&#34;It’s common for one server to go offline for some periods of time, but these incidents have seen all web properties go offline concurrently. It isn&#39;t common to see their entire internet dropped offline.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">During the incidents, operational degradation would build up first with network timeouts, then individual servers going offline and then their key routers dropping off the internet, Ali said. &#34;This indicates to me that this is the result of some form of network stress rather than something like a power cut.&#34;</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Josh Smith
