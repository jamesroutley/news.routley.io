    <h1>Linux hits nearly 4% desktop user share on Statcounter</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>According to Statcounter, which should be taken with a pinch of salt of course like any sampling, the Linux share on the desktop hit nearly 4% in Decemeber 2023. Last month was a record too and a clear trend over time, as going back a couple of years, it was rarely coming close to 2% but now it&#39;s repeatedly nearing 4% so it&#39;s quite a good sign overall.</p>
<p>The latest from Statcounter shows for all of 2023 below:</p>
<ul>
<li>January - 2.91%</li>
<li>February - 2.94%</li>
<li>March - 2.85%</li>
<li>April - 2.83%</li>
<li>May - 2.7%</li>
<li>June - 3.07%</li>
<li>July - 3.12%</li>
<li>August - 3.18%</li>
<li>September - 3.02%</li>
<li>October - 2.92%</li>
<li>November - 3.22%</li>
<li><strong>December - 3.82%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at December it shows Windows rising too, with macOS dropping down. If we actually take ChromeOS directly into the Linux numbers for December 2023 the overall number would actually be 6.24% (ChromeOS is Linux after all).</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how just Linux looks over time on Statcounter since early 2009 until now:</p>

<p>Seems like a pretty clear trend over time don&#39;t you think? Nice to see this happening elsewhere, just like we&#39;ve seen over years <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/linux-use-on-steam-ends-2023-with-a-multi-year-high-thanks-steam-deck/" target="_blank">with the Steam Survey</a>.</p>
