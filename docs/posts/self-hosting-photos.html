    <h1>Self-Hosting Photos</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p>First rule of internet is same as the first rule of boxing first rule of boxing, “protect yourself at all times”.</p><p>In early 2023, I did a DNA test with 23andme. Of course, I made the rookie mistake of using my real name to create a profile. It might be too late for me but maybe this post helps others. </p><p>Creating a fake name would have been totally viable (according to some Reddit posts). As I got the reports back and became more aware of the subject (and how DNA data can be abused), it felt “wrong” to store it on a cloud service (iCloud, I did enable end to end encryption, so there is hope).</p><p><span>This + watching too much sci-fi </span><a href="https://x.com/divyenduz/status/1636697474667626496" rel="">birthed the idea</a><span> of self-hosting everything including photos, media and files and having control of the email domain.</span></p><p>This year, the goal to move off Google and Apple photos was achieved. But first, let me talk about why I want to go off cloud for this (besides just privacy reasons)</p><p>I use an iPhone and Google Photos, so the pictures were getting synced to both clouds</p><ul><li><p>iCloud capacity was 200GB, Google’s capacity was 2TB - didn’t like this mismatch</p></li><li><p>Wasn’t sure if either / both these upload the full quality picture or pre-process them</p></li><li><p>Wasn’t sure about the relationship between the two clouds. Which one was the source of truth?</p></li><li><p>Privacy concerns (obviously)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Current setup - Synology Photos + Tailscale</strong></p><p>Hardware</p><ul><li><p> Synology DiskStation DS224+ 2 Bay Dekstop NAS</p></li><li><p>Seagate IronWolf 4TB Internal Hard Drive x 2</p></li></ul><p>Setup</p><ul><li><p>Synology Hybrid Raid SHR (3.6TB usable space)</p></li><li><p>Google Drive for backups (more later)</p></li></ul><p>While I didn’t purchase Synology NAS for Photos. It was meant for sensitive files like DNA data, identity document scans. In my research I quickly realized that synology photos has come a long way and can actually replace Google/Apple photos app. </p><p>The Synology Photos app offers a “backup” feature that downloads original quality pictures from Apple Photos and then you can optionally delete photos from Apple Photos. This is what I use but my “backup” is the “real” copy of my photos.</p><p>To access it on mobile devices, I use Tailscale and point the Synology Photos app to the Tailscale IP.</p><p>I could delete Google Photos. Apple Photos is not deletable (as the app is also the OS level API to move things around, duh) but I disabled photos sync to iCloud. </p><p><strong>Experience so far</strong></p><ul><li><p>Since I suddenly had much more storage space available. I started recording videos in Apple Log format and started taking photos in DNG (digital negative) format.</p></li><li><p>DNG / Log - this is still experimental, log needs to be processed and DNG needs to be converted to JPEG (possible in Synology) before posting to socials.</p></li><li><p>Tailscale makes accessing the library remotely easy BUT makes using a VPN hard. As iOS can only have one VPN at a time and I haven’t explored split DNS VPN on iOS yet (maybe it isn’t possible?). I can use Tailscale + Mullvad integration in dire situations.</p></li><li><p>Backups still go to Google Drive, but they are encrypted on the device.</p></li></ul><p>Ending this post with this security quote</p><blockquote><p>If something is on the network, assume that it is exposed.</p></blockquote><p>Hit me up if you have any questions about the setup.</p></div></div></div>
