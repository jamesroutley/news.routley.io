<p>Apple banned the ‌Epic Games‌ developer account back in 2020 when ‌Epic Games‌ violated its ‌App Store‌ rules to add web-based purchases, kicking off a multi-year legal battle. Because the main ‌Epic Games‌ developer account continues to be banned, Epic submitted Fortnite to the U.S. ‌App Store‌ using an account from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/epic-games-fortnite-us-app-store/">Epic Games Sweden</a>, a subsidiary that Epic formed to create the ‌Epic Games‌ Store alternative app marketplace in the European Union.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/09/fortnite-submitted-to-us-app-store/">submitted for review</a> on May 9, but after waiting over 120 hours without a response, Epic was forced to pull and resubmit its application to include the latest update.</p>
<p>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has been vocal about his frustration with the situation, claiming that Apple has not been returning the company&#39;s calls and that the review process <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/epic-resubmits-fortnite-to-app-store/">typically moves much faster</a>.</p>
<p>Before submitting Fortnite to the U.S. App Store, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said the company spoke with Apple about its plans – but never claimed Apple approved them. It remains unclear if Apple will allow Fortnite back, as the Epic v. Apple lawsuit confirmed that Apple has the right to ban Epic&#39;s account and isn&#39;t required to reinstate it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the latest chapter in the ongoing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">legal battle</a> between the two companies, which began in 2020 when Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store after Epic implemented direct payment options that bypassed Apple&#39;s 30% commission.</p>
<p>The game had briefly returned to iOS devices in the EU via the Epic Games Store, but that version has now also gone offline.</p>
