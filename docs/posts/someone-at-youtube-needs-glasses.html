    <p>Opened YouTube and was greeted with this abomination:</p>

<p><img src="https://jayd.ml/assets/posts/2025-04-30-someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses/abomination.png"/></p>

<p>This is on a 32” 1440p display. There are five (5) videos visible, and 1/6 of 
the page would have been an enormous ad.</p>

<p>For reference, here is YouTube as of January 2019:</p>

<p><img src="https://jayd.ml/assets/posts/2025-04-30-someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses/old.png"/></p>

<p>There are 30 videos visible and zero ads.</p>

<p>I really, really hope that this A/B test fails.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, using an advanced analytics package I’ve projected that around
May 2026 the YouTube homepage will just be one video, and by September there 
will be no videos at all on the homepage.</p>

<p>Presumably by then we’ll have our mandatory NeuraLinks and the YouTube algorithm
will be able to inject real-time ML generated content (and ads) straight into 
our brains, tuning its output as needed to maximize our dopamine response.</p>

<p>I miss YouTube before they turned the pain dial all the way towards money.</p>
