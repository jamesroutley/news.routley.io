<p>AMD CEO Lia Su said that chips made in TSMC’s Arizona facility are more expensive than those made in a comparable facility in Taiwan. Dr. Su said that U.S.-made chips cost ‘more than 5% but less than 20%’ higher, and she added during an interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-23/amd-ceo-su-sees-chips-from-us-tsmc-plant-costing-5-to-20-more" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-23/amd-ceo-su-sees-chips-from-us-tsmc-plant-costing-5-to-20-more" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Bloomberg</a> that these are costs that the company must shoulder to have a more resilient supply chain.</p><p>“I think the economics of it are we have to consider the resiliency of the supply chain, I think we learned that during the pandemic — the idea that you think about your supply chains not just by the lowest cost, but also about reliability, about resiliency, and all those things. I think that’s how we’re thinking about U.S. manufacturing,” the CEO said to Bloomberg’s Ed Ludlow. “And yes, it will be a little bit more expensive — frankly, some of the work that has been done to encourage semiconductor investment has been helpful. But when you really average it across everything else that you need to build this computing infrastructure, I think it’s a very good investment for us to make to assure that we have American manufacturing and resiliency.”</p><p>TSMC Arizona has already reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/tsmcs-arizona-fab-21-is-already-making-4nm-chips-yield-and-quality-reportedly-on-par-with-taiwan-fabs" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/tsmcs-arizona-fab-21-is-already-making-4nm-chips-yield-and-quality-reportedly-on-par-with-taiwan-fabs">started manufacturing 4nm chips</a> earlier this year, with yield and quality said to be comparable to that of its factories in its home country of Taiwan. And while many companies fear that moving their manufacturing to the U.S. would cost significantly more, some experts estimate that wafer production at the Arizona site is only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/producing-wafers-at-tsmc-arizona-is-only-10-percent-more-expensive-than-in-taiwan-techinsights" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/producing-wafers-at-tsmc-arizona-is-only-10-percent-more-expensive-than-in-taiwan-techinsights">about 10% more expensive</a> compared to Taiwan.

IMO a 10% price increase for U.S. produced products isn&#39;t unreasonable. Some companies however like to exploit customers by increasing prices 25+% which will likely cost them customers.

Another thing to consider - in the event of a supply-chain disruption, that higher price becomes a lower price relative to the prices that emerge via scarcity.</p></div>

Where do we get wafers? Where do we get the chemicals? The machines they are made on are imported. The only aspect that is going to be American made is that the final processing happens in the USA. Kind of like many cars. Everything is sourced overseas, but assembled here...</p></div>
