    <h1>VSCode Marketplace Web Pages No Longer Allow Direct VSIX Downloads</h1>

          <p dir="auto">Regarding these comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Based on our data and analysis, &#34;Download Extension&#34; was not part of the inner developer flow that we are constantly trying to optimize, so we decided to no longer support it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">VS Code runs on a machine with no internet</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">To understand your setup better, why the machine with internet can not run VS Code? In what kind of enterprise do you work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I too am working in a similar environment. Our developer PCs do not have direct access to the internet. The internet is accessed via a special virtual machine (<a href="https://www.m-privacy.de/en/tightgate-pro-safe-surfing/" rel="nofollow">TightGate</a>), which only runs a browser and allows to retrieve files downloaded in that VM via secure copy (SCP). For security reasons, there is no way at all to have VSCode installed in a PC or VM which has direct access to the internet.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have been working in different companies, which apply the same rules. This is no weird edge case, and I am surprised it needs explaining.</p>
<p dir="auto">Without the download button, I have to open VSCode on my personal PC at home, after work, get the link, send it to me via email or whatever.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please bring back a simple way to download VSIX files from the VS Marketplace webpage.</p>
