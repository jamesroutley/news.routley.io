I have saved a lot of PDFs, Google Docs, and ebooks that I want to read but never got a chance to do so. When NotebookLM came out, I created folders of business, philosophy, and lifestyle. Then I created a NotebookLM doc for each of them. I’d go to the corresponding doc to ask questions in each area of my life. Sometimes it’d give me the answer I need or provide the source/context for me to dive deeper. Now I finally get to “use” this knowledge at the right time.</p></div></div></div>
