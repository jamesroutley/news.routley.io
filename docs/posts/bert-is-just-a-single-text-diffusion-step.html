    <h1>BERT is just a single text diffusion step</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="Text Diffusion" src="https://nathan.rs/images/roberta-diffusion.gif"/></p><p>A while back, Google DeepMind unveiled <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-diffusion/">Gemini Diffusion</a>, an experimental language model that generates text using diffusion. Unlike traditional GPT-style models that generate one word at a time, Gemini Diffusion creates whole blocks of text by refining random noise step-by-step.</p><p>I read the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09992">Large Language Diffusion Models</a> and was surprised to find that discrete language diffusion is just a generalization of masked language modeling (MLM), something we’ve been doing since <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">2018</a>.
The first thought I had was, “can we finetune a BERT-like model to do text generation?” I decided to try a quick proof of concept out of curiosity.</p><blockquote><p>NOTE: After I wrote the article I stumbled upon the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15029">DiffusionBERT</a> which does essentially the same thing but with more rigorous testing! Check it out if this post interested you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="a-short-history-of-transformers">A Short History of Transformers<a href="#a-short-history-of-transformers">#</a></h2><hr/><p>The original Transformer architecture, introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">2017</a>, was an encoder-decoder model. In 2018, researchers realized that the encoder and decoder components of the model could be separated (with the advent of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf">GPT</a>), and two distinct families of models were created:</p><ol><li><strong>Encoder-only models (BERT-style, bidirectional)</strong></li></ol><p>Encoder models used masked language modeling (MLM) as a training objective: randomly mask out a subset of tokens of each input and train the encoder to reconstruct the missing tokens (fill in the blanks).
The model sees the entire (partially masked) context at once and learns bidirectional representations.
This architecture excelled at tasks requiring a full‐sentence (or paragraph) representation (e.g., classification and retrieval).</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Decoder-only models (GPT-style, autoregressive)</strong></li></ol><p>Decoder models used next‐token prediction as a training objective: at each position $t$, predict the token at position $t + 1$ given all tokens up to $t$ as context. Only the left context is used to predict future values (unidirectional).
This architecture excelled at generative tasks where you produce text one token at a time, such as open‐ended generation, summarization, and translation.</p><p>Originally, BERT saw immediate use in tasks such as classification, whereas GPT-style models didn’t become popular until later (due to initial limited capabilities). Eventually, the generation capabilities of autoregressive (decoder) transformers vastly improved. The general training objective of “next token prediction” means a much larger space of use cases when compared to encoder models.</p><h2 id="discrete-language-diffusion-models">Discrete Language Diffusion Models<a href="#discrete-language-diffusion-models">#</a></h2><hr/><p>Diffusion models were first popularized in image generation. In image generation, diffusion models gradually add Gaussian noise to an image (forward process) and then train a neural network to iteratively denoise it (reverse process). A high‐level summary of continuous diffusion with images is:</p><ol><li><strong>Forward process</strong>: Start from a clean image <em>x₀</em>, then add small amounts of (usually Gaussian) noise at each timestep until you end up with near‐pure noise.</li><li><strong>Reverse process</strong>: Train a model (often a U‐Net) to predict the noise at each timestep, gradually recovering the original image in discrete denoising steps.</li></ol><p>Applying this idea to language means we need a way to add noise to text and then remove it in stages.
The simplest way to do this is a <strong>masking‐based noise process</strong>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Forward (masking) process</strong>:</p><ul><li>At timestep <em>t = 0</em>, you have a fully uncorrupted text sequence.</li><li>At each subsequent timestep <em>t &gt; 0</em>, randomly replace a fraction of tokens with a special <code>&lt;MASK&gt;</code> token according to a pre‐defined schedule (e.g., gradually increasing the masked proportion from 0% to 100%).</li><li>By the final timestep <em>T</em>, the entire sequence may be masked (all tokens are <code>&lt;MASK&gt;</code>).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Reverse (denoising) process</strong>:</p><ul><li>Train a model (often a standard Transformer encoder) to predict the original token IDs given a partially masked sequence at timestep <em>t</em>.</li><li>This is akin to performing masked language modeling at varying mask rates: at early timesteps, only a few tokens are masked (easy to predict); at later timesteps, many tokens are masked (harder).</li><li>By chaining together predictions from high‐mask‐rate back down to zero, you can recover (or generate) a full sequence.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In this discrete text diffusion framework, the model learns a likelihood bound on the data distribution by optimizing a sum of denoising losses over all timesteps, rather than a single MLM objective at a fixed mask probability.</p><p>As we can see, BERT’s masked language modeling objective is the <strong>same training objective as text diffusion, but just for a subset of masking rates</strong>.
By introducing variable masking rates (from 0 to 1) and a scheduled sequence of denoising steps (inspired by diffusion theory), we can transform BERT’s masked language modeling objective into a full generative procedure.</p><h2 id="roberta-diffusion">RoBERTa Diffusion<a href="#roberta-diffusion">#</a></h2><hr/><p>In 2019, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692">RoBERTa</a> was released. It was essentially just an enhancement of the original BERT model, with better hyperparameters, data training size, and a more simple training objective (MLM only, removed next sentence prediction).</p><p>Here we use the HuggingFace <code>transformers</code> and <code>dataset</code> libraries to pull in the original RoBERTa weights, tokenizer, and the Trainer class to easily finetune the model on the WikiText dataset.
