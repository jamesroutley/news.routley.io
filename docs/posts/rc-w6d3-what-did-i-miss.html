      <div><p>I switched my focus from ML to data infra about 3 years ago. The natural question to ask as I started looking into ML again is, what did I miss?</p><p>For sequential modeling, LSTM was the state-of-the-art. Now they’re seen as <a href="https://youtu.be/P6sfmUTpUmc?t=57">difficult to optimize</a>. Andrej Karpathy shared his thoughts on <a href="https://youtu.be/P6sfmUTpUmc?t=2184">recent developments</a> in his 3rd video on `makemore` - residual connections, (batch, layer and group) normalization layers, as well as better optimizers (like RMSProp and Adam).</p><p>What I also found interesting his approach to diagnostics; he’s very deliberate at making sure viewers develop awareness of how things can go wrong and what to do about it. Note to self to spend a bit more time on <a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b">backprop from 1st principles</a>.</p></div>
