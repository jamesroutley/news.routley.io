    <h1>Ask HN: Has anyone sold their employee stock on the secondary market?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Wanted to hear about experiences from employees who have RSUs/options in a private company and whether they were able to sell their shares on the secondary market?<p>Were you able to sell?
What platform did you use?
Were you able to sell w/o board approval? If so, were you able to use private forward contracts to complete a deal?</p><p>Anything you can tell me about the experience would be much appreciated!</p></div></div>
