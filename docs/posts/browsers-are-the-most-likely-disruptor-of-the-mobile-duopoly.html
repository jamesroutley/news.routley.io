      </h2>
      <h3>Browsers are the most likely disruptor of the mobile duopoly but you&#39;d never know it reading Wired or The Verge.</h3>
      
    </header>
    <p>The tech news is chockablock with <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/owa-2023-review/">antitrust rumblings and slow-motion happenings.</a> Through eagle-eyed press coverage, regulatory reports, and legal discovery the shady dealings of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers">Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/30/23923533/google-explains-why-some-developers-were-able-to-get-away-with-paying-less-on-play">Google&#39;s</a> app stores are now comprehensively documented and pressure for change has built to an unsustainable level. Something&#39;s gotta give.</p>
<p>This is the backdrop to the biggest app store story nobody is writing about: on pain of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2349#:~:text=In%20case%20a,systemic%20non%2Dcompliance.">steep fines,</a> gatekeepers are opening up to competing browsers. This, in turn, will enable competitors to replace app stores with directories of <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/">Progressive Web Apps</a>. Capable browsers that <a href="https://patrickbrosset.com/articles/2023-09-26-my-first-tpac-conference/#:~:text=The%20Web%20Applications,was%20also%20reviewed.">expose</a> web app installation and powerful features to developers can kickstart app portability, breaking open the mobile duopoly.</p>
<p>But you&#39;d never know it reading Wired or The Verge.</p>

<p>With shockingly few <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/09/apple_app_store/">exceptions,</a> coverage of app store regulation that the answer to crummy, extractive native app stores is other native app stores. This unexamined framing shapes hundreds of pieces covering regulatory events, including <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/">by web-friendly authors.</a> The tech press almost universally fails to mention the web as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_good">substitute</a> for native apps and fail to inform readers of its potential to disrupt app stores.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/the-open-web-is-good-actually-9683c692df84#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAn%20app%20is%20just%20a%20web%2Dpage%20wrapped%20in%20enough%20IP%20to%20make%20it%20a%20crime%20to%20defend%20yourself%20against%20corporate%20predation%E2%80%9D">Cory Doctorow observed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;An app is just a web-page wrapped in enough IP to make it a crime to defend yourself against corporate predation.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The implication is clear: browsers unchained can do to mobile what the web did to desktop, where more than 70% of daily &#34;jobs to be done&#34; happen on the web.</p>
<p>Replacing mobile app stores will look different than the web&#39;s path to desktop centrality, but the enablers are waiting in the wings. It has gone largely unreported that <a href="https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps">Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</a> have been held back by Apple and Google denying competing browsers access to essential APIs.</p>
<p>Thankfully, regulators haven&#39;t been waiting on the press to explain the situation. Recent interventions into mobile ecosystems include requirements to repair browser choice, and the analysis backing those regulations takes into account the web&#39;s role as a potential competitor (e.g., <a href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/file/230327EN_Summary.pdf">Japan&#39;s JFTC (pdf)</a>).</p>
<p>Regulators seem to understand that:</p>
<ul>
<li>App stores protect proprietary ecosystems through preferential discovery and capabilities.</li>
<li>Stores then extract rents from developers dependent on commodity capabilities duopolists provide only through proprietary APIs.</li>
<li>App portability threatens the proprietary agenda of app stores.</li>
<li>The web can interrupt this model by bringing portability to apps and over-the-top discovery through search. This has yet to happen because...</li>
<li>The duopolists, in different ways, have kneecapped competing browsers along with their own, keeping the web from contesting the role of app stores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple and Google saw what the web did to desktop, and they&#39;ve laid roadblocks to the competitive forces that would let history repeat on smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="the-buried-lede">The Buried Lede <a href="#the-buried-lede">#</a></h2>
<p>The web&#39;s potential to disrupt mobile is evident to regulators, <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/">advocates</a>, and developers. So why does the tech news fail to explain the situation?</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/231226/p14#a231226p14">just one</a> of the many antitrust events of recent months. It was covered by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/28/24017565/japan-plans-to-crack-down-on-apple-and-google-app-stores">The Verge</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/japan-preparing-eu-style-law/">Mac Rumors</a>, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/12/26/japan-plans-to-fine-apple-over-app-stores-and-antitrust-issues">Apple Insider</a>, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38773429">more.</a></p>
<p>None of the linked articles note browser competition&#39;s potential to upend app stores. Browsers unshackled have the potential to free businesses from build-it-twice proprietary ecosystems, end rapacious app store taxes, pave the way for new OS entrants — all without the valid security concerns side-loading introduces.</p>
<p>Lest you think this an isolated incident, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230820/p8#a230820p8">this article on the impact of the EU&#39;s DMA</a> lacks any hint of the web&#39;s potential to unseat app stores. You can repeat this trick with <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/search/query?q=EU+DMA&amp;wm=false"><em>any</em> DMA story from the past year</a>. Or spot-check <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230201/p11#a230201p11">coverage</a> of the <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/report/2023/competition-mobile-app-ecosystem">NTIA&#39;s February report.</a></p>
<p>Reporters are &#34;covering&#34; these stories in the lightest sense of the word. Barrels of virtual ink has been spilt documenting unfair app store terms, conditions, and competition. And yet.</p>
<h2 id="disruption-disrupted">Disruption Disrupted <a href="#disruption-disrupted">#</a></h2>
<p>In an industry obsessed with &#34;disruption,&#34; why is this David vs. Goliath story going untold? Some theories, in no particular order.</p>
<p>First, Mozilla <a href="https://infrequently.org/2020/06/platform-adjacency-theory/#the-committee-to-cast-the-web-in-amber">isn&#39;t advocating for a web that can challenge native apps,</a> and none of the other major browser vendors are telling the story either. Apple and Google have no interest in seeing their lucrative proprietary platforms supplanted, and Microsoft (your narrator&#39;s employer) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23930478/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-mobile-windows-phone">famously lacks sustained mobile focus.</a></p>
<p>Next, it&#39;s hard to overlook that tech reporters live like wealthy people, iPhones and all. From that vantage point, it&#39;s often news that the web is <a href="https://fugu-tracker.web.app/">significantly more capable</a> on other OSes (never mind that they spend much of every day working in a desktop browser). It&#39;s hard to report on the potential of something you can&#39;t see for yourself.</p>
<p>Also, this might all be Greek. Reporters and editors aren&#39;t software engineers, so the potential of browser competition can remain understandably opaque. Stories that include mention of &#34;alternative app stores&#34; generally fail to mention that these stores may not be as safe, or that OS restrictions on features won&#39;t disappear just because of a different distribution mechanism, or that the security track records of the <em>existing</em> duopolist app stores are sketchy at best. Under these conditions, it&#39;s asking a lot to expect details-based discussion of alternatives, given the many technical wrinkles. Hopefully, <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/">someone can walk them through it.</a></p>
<p>Further, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contestable_market">market contestability theory</a> has only recently become a big part of the tech news beat. Regulators have been writing reports to convey their understanding of the market, and to shape effective legislation that will unchain the web, but smart folks unversed in both antitrust and browser minutiae might need help to pick up what regulators are putting down.</p>
<p>Lastly, it hasn&#39;t happened yet. Yes, <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/">Progressive Web Apps</a> have been around for a few years, but they haven&#39;t had an impact on the iPhones that reporters and their circles almost universally carry. It&#39;s much easier to get folks to cover stories that directly affect them, and this is one that, so far, largely hasn&#39;t.</p>
<h2 id="green-shoots">Green Shoots <a href="#green-shoots">#</a></h2>
<p>The seeds of web-based app store dislocation have already been sown, but the chicken-and-egg question at the heart of platform competition looms.</p>
<p>On the technology side, Apple has been <a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/">enormously successful at denying essential capabilities to the web</a> through a strategy of compelled monoculture combined with strategic foot-dragging.</p>

<p>As an example, the <a href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/safari-16-4-is-an-admission/">eight-year delay</a> in implementing Push Notifications for the web kept many businesses from giving the web a second thought. If they couldn&#39;t re-engage users at the same rates as native apps, the web might as well not exist on phones. This logic has played out on a loop over the last decade, category-by-category, with gatekeepers preventing competing browsers from bringing capabilities to web apps that would let them supplant app stores while simultaneously keeping them from being discovered through existing stores.</p>
<p>Proper browser choice could upend this situation, finally allowing the web to provide &#34;table stakes&#34; features in a compelling way. For the first time, developers could bring the modern web&#39;s full power to wealthy mobile users, enabling the &#34;write once, test everywhere&#34; vision, and cut out the app store middleman — all without sacrificing essential app features or undermining security.</p>
<p>Sunsetting the 30% tax requires a compelling alternative, and Apple&#39;s simultaneous underfunding of Safari and compelled adoption of its underpowered engine have interlocked to keep the web out of the game. No wonder Apple is massively funding lobbyists, lawyers, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-19/apple-flexes-muscle-as-quiet-power-behind-app-developer-group">astroturf groups</a> to keep engine diversity at bay while belatedly <a href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/safari-16-4-is-an-admission/">battening the hatches</a>.</p>
<p>On the business side, managers think about &#34;mobile&#34; as a category. Rather than digging into the texture of iOS, Android, and the differing web features available on each, businesses tend to bulk accept or reject the app store model. One sub-segment of &#34;mobile&#34; growing the ability to route around highway robbery Ts &amp; Cs is tantalising, but not enough to change the game; the web, like other metaplatforms, is only a disruptive force when pervasive and capable.</p>
<p>A prohibition on store discovery for web apps has buttressed Apple&#39;s denial of essential features to browsers:</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity">Google&#39;s answer to web apps in Play is a dog&#39;s breakfast</a>, but it <em>does</em> at least exist for developers willing to put in the effort, or for teams savvy enough to reach for <a href="https://www.pwabuilder.com/">PWA Builder.</a></p>
<p>Recent developments also point to a competitive future for capable web apps.</p>
<p>First, browser engine choice should become a reality on iOS in the EU in 2024, thanks to the plain language of the DMA. Apple will, of course, attempt to delay the entry of competing browsers through as-yet-unknown strategies, but the clock is ticking. Once browsers can enable capable web apps with easier distribution, the logic of the app store loses a bit of its lustre.</p>
<p>Work is also underway to give competing browsers a <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/WebInstall/explainer_cross_domain.md">chance to facilitate PWAs that can install other PWAs.</a> Web App Stores would then become a real possibility through browsers that support them, and we should expect that regulatory and legislative interventions will facilitate this in the near future. Removed from the need to police security (browsers have that covered) and handle distribution (websites update themselves), PWA app stores like <a href="https://store.app/">store.app</a> can become honest-to-goodness app management surfaces that can safely facilitate discovery and sync.</p>

  PWA app stores like <a href="https://appsco.pe/" target="_new">Appscope</a> and <a href="https://store.app">store.app</a> exist, but they&#39;re hobbled by gatekeepers that have denied competing browsers access to APIs that could turn PWA directories into real contenders.
<figcaption>
</figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&#39;s no surprise that Apple and Google have kept private the APIs needed to make this better future possible. They built the necessary infrastructure for the web to disrupt native, then kept it to themselves. This potential has remained locked away within organisations politically hamstrung by native app store agendas. But all of that is about to change.</p>
<p>This begs the question: where&#39;s the coverage? This is the most exciting moment in more than 15 years for the web vs. native story, but the tech press is whiffing it.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-hope">A New Hope <a href="#a-new-hope">#</a></h2>
<p>2024 will be packed to the gills with app store and browser news, from implementation of the DMA, to the UK&#39;s renewed push into mobile browsers and cloud gaming, to new legislation arriving in many jurisdictions, to the first attempts at shipping iOS ports of Blink and Gecko browsers. Each event is a chance to inform the public about the already-raging battle for the future of the phone.</p>
<p>It&#39;s still possible to reframe these events and provide better context. We need a fuller discussion about what it will mean for mobile OSes to have competing native app stores when the underlying OSes are foundationally insecure. There are also existing examples of ecosystems with this sort of choice (e.g., China), and more needs to be written about the implications for users and developers. Instead of nirvana, the insecure status quo of today&#39;s mobile OSes, combined with (even more) absentee app store purveyors, turns side-loading into an alternative form of lock-in, with a kicker of added insecurity for users. With such a foundation, the tech-buying public could understand why a browser&#39;s superior sandboxing, web search&#39;s better discovery, and frictionless links are better than dodgy curation side-deals and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRegarding%20review%20processes,we%20can%20detect%3F%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D"><em>&#34;beware of dog&#34;</em> sign security.</a></p>
<p>The more that folks understand the stakes, the more likely tech will genuinely change for the better. And isn&#39;t that what public interest journalism is <em>for</em>?</p>
