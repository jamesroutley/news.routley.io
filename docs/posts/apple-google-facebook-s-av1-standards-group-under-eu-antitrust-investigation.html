    </p><div><p>Antitrust regulators in the European Union are now investigating the wide-ranging big tech coalition that controls the AV1 video codec standard, citing concerns over anticompetitive behavior.
</p><p>The Alliance for Open Media (AOM) was founded in 2015 to find a suitable video format that would adhere to W3C and HTML5 standards. It has co-developed the AV1 standard, an open video codec created as a royalty-free alternative to HEVC.
</p><p>AV1 is seen as a better technical alternative to many video formats, as it offers better compression and, thus, uses less bandwidth and storage. 
</p><p>The 14 governing members of AOM include Google, Facebook, Intel, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia, Samsung, and many others including Apple, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/01/04/apple-joins-alliance-for-open-media-signaling-support-for-av1-video">which joined in 2018</a>. There are 41 general members including Adobe, AMD, Alibaba, the BBC, Hulu, VideoLan, Vimeo, and more.
</p><p>Now, the European Union is investigating alleged anticompetitive behavior related to the license terms of AV1 by AOM and its members in Europe. The watchdog group has sent a questionnaire, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-eu-antitrust-regulators-probing-tech-group-aoms-video-licensing-policy-2022-07-07/">seen by</a> <em>Reuters</em>, to companies involved.
</p><p>&#34;The Commission has information that AOM and its members may be imposing licensing terms (mandatory royalty-free cross licensing) on innovators that were not a part of AOM at the time of the creation of the AV1 technical, but whose patents are deemed essential to (its) technical specifications,&#34; read the questionnaire.
</p><p>The group cites concerns that AOM may be restricting innovators&#39; ability to compete with AV1.The EU alleges that if true, it eliminates incentives for innovations. 
</p><p>The companies involved could be fined up to 10% of their global revenue for breaching EU rules. No timetable for the investigation has been announced.</p></div></div>
