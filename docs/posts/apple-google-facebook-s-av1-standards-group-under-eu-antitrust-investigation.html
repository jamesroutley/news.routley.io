Founded in 2015, the group aims to create a new standard software for streaming higher-quality 4K video on browsers, devices, apps, and gaming, known as AV1.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">While the AV1 software is not yet adopted widely, Netflix <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/NFLX.O" target="_blank">(NFLX.O)</a> and YouTube have started using it for some customers, and browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox have started to support the new format.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Apple and Google did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
