    <h1>Googleâ€™s AI thinks I left a Gatorade bottle on the moon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article>
<p>Google&#39;s <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">NotebookLLM</a> is the first AI podcast I&#39;d actually listen to.
Give it a web page or document, and it will generate you a podcast about it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s really good. But it&#39;s also really easy to trick.</p>
<p>So I modified my website to lie to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a human visits <a href="https://edwardbenson.com">my homepage</a>, they see a regular page about me.</li>
<li>When Google&#39;s AI visits my homepage, it sees fake producer&#39;s show notes for an episode about me flying to the moon on my bike with balloons and a scuba tank.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://edwardbenson.com/images/homepage-trick.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>The result is pretty hilarious -- have a listen to the true history of the US Space Program:</p>

  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>

<h2>More Seriously..</h2>
<p>If it&#39;s this easy to detect an AI and provide it a &#34;special&#34; set of facts, you&#39;d better believe people are already doing it all over the web.</p>
<p>The attack vector is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, acquire a web page that ranks highly for a particular term.</li>
<li>Next, plant an &#34;AI Only&#34; version of the content, hidden to humans, designed to bias how the AI thinks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, when the AI searches the web to assist with an answer, it won&#39;t just find lies, but weaponized lies: content designed specifically for LLM manipulation.</p>
<p>So next time you ask your LLM of choice for advice on something, and you notice it&#39;s searching the web to prepare an answer, be aware that its response is potentially compromised by tactics like this - even if you can&#39;t see them with your own eyes when you check the sources.</p>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p><strong>Steering the LLM</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;d <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1fr31h8/comment/lpj6uef/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">read that</a> NotebookLLM was easy to steer by feeding it fake &#34;producer show notes&#34;, so that&#39;s how I typed my fake story.</p>
<p><a href="https://edwardbenson.com/moon-goof">Here is a copy in full</a>.</p>
<p>I did no edits and only a single generation, and it followed my beat sheet <strong>exactly</strong>, so I&#39;d say that was 10/10 steerability.</p>
<p><strong>Tricking the Scraper Bot</strong></p>
<p>You can upload a documents with fake show notes straight to NotebookLLM&#39;s website, so if you&#39;re making silly podcast episodes for your kids, that&#39;s the best way to do it.</p>
<p>But if you want to trick Google&#39;s bot on your website, just detect the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers">GoogleOther</a> user agent in your request headers and then serve your &#34;special&#34; data instead of the real website.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an <a href="https://github.com/eob/isai">NPM package called <code>isai</code></a> I scraped together to make this simple. It&#39;s based on <a href="https://npmjs.com/isbot">isbot</a>. When rendering your page, just say:</p>
<pre><code>import { isai } from &#34;isai&#34;;

if (isai(request.headers.get(&#34;User-Agent&#34;))) {
  // Return web page just for AI consumption
} else {
  // Return web page for human consumption
}
</code></pre>
<p>Warning that <code>GoogleOther</code> is not exclusive to NotebookLLM; it appears to be used for a variety of non-production Google products, so doing this risks seeding other Google properties with bad data about you. For this reason, I took down the moon story from my actual homepage for <code>GoogleOther</code> agents.</p></article></div></div>
