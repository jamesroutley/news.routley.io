Up to half of the attendees at cult meetings may have been undercover researchers.

After the failed prediction, rather than doubling down, some of the cultists walked back their statements or left altogether.</span></p><p><span>Between this, the </span><a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/i/178108059/18-dissonance-about-dissonance" rel="">impossible numbers in the original laboratory study of cognitive dissonance</a><span>, and a </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/25152459231213375" rel="">recent failure to replicate a basic dissonance effect</a><span>, things aren’t looking great for the phenomenon.</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-187399837" href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/i-swear-the-ufo-is-coming-any-minute#footnote-1-187399837" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> But that only makes me believe in it harder!</span></p><p><span>Another classic sadly struck from the canon of behavioral/brain sciences: the neurologist Oliver Sacks appears to have </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/12/15/oliver-sacks-put-himself-into-his-case-studies-what-was-the-cost" rel="">greatly embellished or even invented his case studies</a><span>. In a letter to his brother, Sacks described his blockbuster </span><em>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat </em><span>as a book of “fairy tales [...] half-report, half-imagined, half-science, half-fable”.</span></p><p><span>This is exactly how the </span><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/mjhnp_v1" rel="">Stanford Prison Experiment</a><span> and the </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0957154X221150878" rel="">Rosenhan experiment</a><span> got debunked—someone started rooting around in the archives and found a bunch of damning notes. I’m confused: back in the day, why was everybody meticulously documenting their research malfeasance?</span></p><p><span>If you ever took PSY 101, you’ve probably heard of </span><a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/S0022-5371(74)80011-3" rel="">this study from 1974</a><span>. You show people a video of a car crash, and then you ask them to estimate how fast the cars were going, and their answer depends on what verb you use. For example, if you ask “How fast were the cars going when they </span><em>smashed</em><span> into each other?” people give higher speed estimates than if you ask, “How fast were the cars going when they </span><em>hit</em><span> each other?” (Emphasis mine). This study has been cited nearly </span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1177025544043488986&amp;as_sdt=400005&amp;sciodt=0,14&amp;hl=en" rel="">4,000 times</a><span>, and its first author became a </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/05/how-elizabeth-loftus-changed-the-meaning-of-memory" rel="">much sought-after expert witness</a><span> who testifies about the faultiness of memory.</span></p><p><span>A blogger named Croissanthology re-ran the study with nearly 10x as many participants (446 vs. 45 in the original). The effect </span><a href="https://x.com/croissanthology/status/1985941107189166430" rel="">did not replicate</a><span>. No replication is perfect, but no original study is either. And remember, this kind of effect is supposed to be so robust and generalizable that we can deploy it in court.</span></p><p><span>I think the underlying point of this research is still correct: memory is reconstructed, not simply recalled, so what we remember is not exactly what we saw. But our memories are not so fragile that a single word can overwrite them. Otherwise, if you ever got pulled over for speeding, you could just be like, “Officer, how fast was I going when my car </span><em>crawled past </em><span>you?”</span></p><p><span>In </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/386588" rel="">one study from 1995</a><span>, physicians who were shown multiple treatment options were more likely to recommend no treatment at all. The researchers thought this was a “choice overload” effect, like “ahhh there’s too many choices, so I’ll just choose nothing at all”. In contrast, </span><a href="https://www.jasoncollins.blog/posts/more-options-more-action-contradicting-a-classic-finding?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" rel="">a new study from 2025</a><span> found that when physicians were shown multiple treatment options, they were somewhat </span><em>more </em><span>likely to recommend a treatment.</span></p><p><span>I think “choice overload” is like many effects we discover in psychology: </span><em>can </em><span>it happen? Yes. Can the opposite also happen? Also yes. When does it go one way, and when does it go the other? Ahhh you’re showing me too many options I don’t know.</span></p><p>Okay, enough dumping on other people’s research. It’s my turn in the hot seat.</p><p><span>In 2022, my colleague Jason Dana and I published a paper showing that </span><a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/youre-probably-wrong-about-how-things" rel="">people don’t know how public opinion has changed</a><span>.

We come to different conclusions because we ask different questions. Jason and I ask, “When people estimate change, how </span><em>far off</em><span> are they from the right answer?” Vartanova et al. ask, “Are people’s estimates </span><em>correlated</em><span> with the right answer?” These approaches seem like they should give you the same results, but they don’t, and I’ll show you why.</span></p><p><span>Imagine you ask people to estimate the size of a house, a dog, and a stapler. Vartanova’s correlation approach would say: “People know that a house is bigger than a dog, and that a dog is bigger than a stapler. Therefore, people are good at estimating the sizes of things.” Our approach would say: “People think a house is three miles long, a dog is two inches, and a stapler is 1.5 centimeters. Therefore, people are </span><em>not good</em><span> at estimating the sizes of things.”</span></p><p><span>I think our approach is the right one, for two reasons. First, ours is more useful. As the name implies, a correlation can only tell you about the relationships between things. So it can’t tell you whether people are good at estimating the size of a house. It can only tell you whether people think houses are </span><em>bigger than dogs</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Second, I think our approach is much closer to the way people actually make these judgments in their lives. If I asked you to estimate the size of a house, you wouldn’t spontaneously be like, “Well, it’s bigger than a dog.” You’d just eyeball it. I think people do the same thing with public opinion—they eyeball it based on headlines they see, conversations they have, and vibes they remember. If I asked you, “How have attitudes toward gun control changed?” you wouldn’t be like, “Well, they’ve changed more than attitudes toward gender equality.”</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-187399837" href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/i-swear-the-ufo-is-coming-any-minute#footnote-2-187399837" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>While these reanalyses don’t shift my opinion, I’m glad people are looking into shifts in opinions at all, and that they found our data interesting enough to dig into.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png" width="557" height="637.3008333333333" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1373,&#34;width&#34;:1200,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:557,&#34;bytes&#34;:562663,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://www.experimental-history.com/i/187399837?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption>“it also works if you shake your head a little.”</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>THE LOOP </em><span>is a online magazine produced by my friends Slime Mold Time Mold.

the myth that “you swallow eight spiders every year in your sleep”, and back then, we just had to believe whatever we heard. </p><p><span>Post-internet, anyone can quickly discover that this “fact” was actually a </span><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/swallow-spiders/" rel="">deliberate lie spread by a journalist named Lisa Birgit Holst</a><span>. Holst included the “eight spiders” myth in a 1993 article in a magazine called </span><em>PC Insider</em><span>, using it as an example of exactly the kind of hogwash that spreads easily online.</span></p><p><span>That is, anyway, what most sources will tell you. But if you dig a little deeper, you’ll discover that the whole story about Lisa Birgit Holst is </span><em>also made up</em><span>. “Lisa Birgit Holst” is an anagram of “This is a big troll”; the founder of Snopes </span><a href="https://www.snopes.com/lisa-birgit-holst/" rel="">claims he came up with it in his younger and wilder days</a><span>. The true origin of the spiders myth remains unknown.</span></p><p><span>In 2015, Reagan National Airport in DC received 8,760 noise complaints; 6,852 of those complaints (78%) </span><a href="https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/dourado-airport-noise-mop-v1.pdf" rel="">came from a single household</a><span>, meaning the people living there called to complain an average of 19 times a day. This seems to be common both across airports and across complaint systems in general: </span><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/01/the-tyranny-of-the-complainers.html" rel="">the majority of gripes usually comes from a few prolific gripers</a><span>. Some of these systems are legally mandated to investigate every complaint, so this means a handful of psychotic people with telephones—or now, LLMs—can waste millions of dollars. I keep calling to complain about this, but nobody ever does anything about it.</span></p><p><span data-state="closed"><a href="https://open.substack.com/users/33289192-dynomight?utm_source=mentions"

But if you look at that study that didn’t replicate, it had 10 participants per condition. That’s way too few to detect anything interesting—you need </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2205186" rel="">46 men and 46 women</a><span> just to demonstrate the fact that men weigh more than women, on average. Many of those other cognitive dissonance studies have similarly tiny samples, so their existence doesn’t put me at ease. Plus, the theorizing here is so squishy that many different patterns of results could arguably confirm or disconfirm the theory: here’s someone arguing that, in fact, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericman.bsky.social/post/3m52mjdohwc2q" rel="">the failure to replicate was actually a success</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>A</span><em> </em><span>reporter tracked down Elliot Aronson, a student of Festinger and a dissonance researcher himself, and posed the following question to him:</span></p><blockquote><p>I asked him how the theory could be falsified, since any choice a person made could be attributed to dissonance. “It’s hard to disprove anything,” he said.</p></blockquote><p>Very true, on many levels.</p></div></div><div data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><p><a id="footnote-2-187399837" href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/i-swear-the-ufo-is-coming-any-minute#footnote-anchor-2-187399837" contenteditable="false" target="_self" rel="">2</a></p><p><span>There’s one more point where we disagree. Vartanova et al. point out that 70% of estimates are in the right </span><em>direction</em><span>—as in, if support for gun control went down, 70% of participants correctly guessed that it went down. The researchers look at that number and go, “That seems pretty good”. We look at the exact same number and go, “That seems pretty bad”. Obviously this is a judgment call, but getting the direction right is such a low bar that we think it’s remarkable so many people don’t clear it. Getting the direction of change wrong is a bit like saying that a dog is bigger than a house.</span></p></div></div></div></div>
