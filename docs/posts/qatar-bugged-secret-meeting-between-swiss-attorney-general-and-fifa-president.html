No minutes of the meeting exist and Infantino also said he did not remember it. The meeting was so unusual that two special prosecutors are still investigating Lauber and Infantino in the matter.</p> <!----><!---->  <!---->  <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1gr9h66tk0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">The meeting was held in a building that has been owned by the State of Qatar since 2009. The secret session took place in Conference Room No. 3, just a few metres away from the Qatari Embassy, which was in the same corridor of the hotel.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1gr9h66tq0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">A months-long investigation by NZZ am Sonntag reveals that the covert meeting was secretly recorded by intelligence operatives on behalf of Qatar. The gulf state nation was at the time worried that they would lose the hosting of the FIFA World Cup 2022 due to corruption allegations and human rights violations. It therefore launched an international espionage and influence operation over several years, with the help of ex-CIA agents. FIFA officials were spied upon, and the Swiss Attorney General was likewise of particular interest for Qatar. This was because Lauber’s office was also responsible for investigations regarding irregularities in the awarding of the World Cup to Qatar.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1gr9h66tq1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">The conference room in which Lauber and Infantino met each other was bugged. This newspaper has obtained official secret documents which prove the espionage action. And sources with direct knowledge of the incident described the operation – under the condition of anonymity, due to fear of reprisals. People who were aware of the espionage operation on Swiss soil shortly after it was carried out knew it under the code name «Project Matterhorn.»</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1gr9h66tr0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">According to the sources, the main goal of the action was to record incriminating material. In fact, the recording could have been used for blackmailing Lauber. The Attorney General had every reason to keep the meeting secret - as the reaction of the Federal Criminal Court later proved. Once the informal meetings between Lauber and Infantino became known, the judges sent Lauber into recusal at FIFA proceedings for reasons of bias.</p> <!----><!----> <figure id="id-doc-1gr9sptgp0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="image"><p><img layout="intrinsic" alt="Michael Lauber was Swiss Attorney General from 2012 to 2020.

At the time, Lauber was interrogated by the supervisory authority of the Attorney General’s office. The supervisory authority asked him directly if there had been other meetings with Infantino. Lauber said, «No. Never at the level of Attorney General.» The third meeting was ultimately exposed anyway, as a public prosecutor from Valais stumbled across relevant text messages by chance during proceedings. The Federal Administrative Court found that Lauber had not told the truth, and the Attorney General resigned.</p> <!----><!----> <h2 data-team-subtitle="" id="id-doc-1gr9h66ts0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="subtitle"><span>«Implausible and in part factually incorrect»</span></h2> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1gr9h66ts1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Yet this means that there was a time period in which a foreign state could have uncovered an untrue statement made by the Attorney General to his supervisory authority.

Lauber’s explanations for this did not convince the supervisory authority. He said the hotel near the train station was chosen so that Infantino would not be recognized because that could give rise to speculation. The supervisory authority considered this «implausible and in part factually incorrect».</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1gr9h66ts3" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">A lawyer for Michael Lauber said in a statement that the former Attorney General has no knowledge of a bugging or a recording of the meeting at the Hotel Schweizerhof.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1gr9h66tt0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">In addition, the lawyer said that Lauber had never been blackmailed and had never been approached by Qatari operatives. He still could not remember the June 16, 2017 meeting, the statement read. The State of Qatar, meanwhile, denied all accusations of espionage through a London law firm.</p> <!----><!----> <figure id="id-doc-1gr9suim20" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="image"><p><img layout="intrinsic" alt="Gianni Infantino has been Fifa president since 2016.

Ultimately, Qatar was at the centre of various controversies with the hosting of the World Cup last autumn. As FIFA President, Gianni Infantino had to make several decisions which affected the interests of the small gulf state. Leverage in the hands of the Qataris could have influenced the freedom of action of the top man in world football. A lot of money has been at stake between Qatar and FIFA under Infantino in recent years. Publicly, Infantino caused irritation when he defended Qatar in a bizarre speech against European criticism of human rights violations – and said that he could empathise with migrant workers abused on World Cup building sites, as he had been bullied in Valais as a red-haired child with a migrant background. Infantino changed his residence at least temporarily to a villa in the Qatar capital Doha, as the newspaper Sonntagsblick revealed last year.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1gr9h66u42" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gianni Infantino’s defense lawyer says the FIFA president had no knowledge of «any secret surveillance operations.» Further, «There has never been even a remote attempt by anyone to influence, let alone blackmail.»</p> <!----><!----> <div id="id-doc-1gr9t8hmi0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="infobox-advanced"><h2><span data-team-infobox-title="">Primary documents for download:</span> <svg version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 48 48" style="width:40px;height:40px;"><path pid="0" d="M17 21l7 7 7-7" _stroke="#000"></path></svg></h2> </div> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1gr9h66u43" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">The documents on the espionage operation lead to further questions concerning the Office of the Attorney General.

It was one of the few big FIFA cases which the Swiss Office of the Attorney General ever brought to court. The Office sued three German officials as well as the Swiss Urs Linsi. It concerned ten million Francs which Franz Beckenbauer loaned from a businessman during the 2006 German World Cup bid. When he did not pay it back, the German football association transferred the ten million to the businessman and thus repaid the debt. The Attorney General’s Office interpreted this as criminal mismanagement of the officials.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1gr9h66u53" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">But Beckenbauer had transferred the borrowed money to Qatar. To accounts of the man with the initials MBH: Mohammed bin Hammam. However, the Office of the Attorney General never investigated him. After Qatar not surprisingly failed to respond to a request for legal assistance, the Office of the Attorney General was satisfied with the simple finding that the purpose of the payment was unexplained. However, at the time, it was suspected that the money might have been a bribe.</p> <!----><!----> <h2 data-team-subtitle="" id="id-doc-1gr9tdet00" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="subtitle"><span>Zwanziger: «This confirms what I have always suspected»</span></h2> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1gr9h66u60" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">But the Emir’s close ally remained untouched. He was not even listed as an accused person. Instead, Switzerland indicted the Germans. NZZ am Sonntag found two of the three accused officials who were still active in football in the 2010s explicitly mentioned in the documents as targets of the Qatari espionage operation during its investigation: Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach. Both were seen as opponents of Qatar by the masterminds of the espionage operation. Zwanziger was considered a Qatar critic from the very beginning and had also publicly campaigned against the World Cup in the desert state.
