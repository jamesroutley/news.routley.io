      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I&#39;m ~40yo semi-successful full-stack engineer/hacker who had been recently diagnosed with ADHD (after more than decade of self-seeking journey and introspection). During my diagnosis I learned that ADHD is persistent in 5-7% in general population with some specialist speculating it&#39;s more common in IT due to hypnotizing effect of computers. I know I&#39;m not alone with this :)<p>In hindsight ADHD helped me to get into current position. Being constantly bored, high energy, positive-minded solution and tool seeker is often good thing in times of crisis. When things go stale and there are no things to fix but only boring forms remains it&#39;s usually mortal battle with burnout, procrastination, self-doubt. One which usually ends with me quitting due to burnout or - rarely - getting kicked off because the next more boring thing took longer than anticipated.</p><p>Right now I&#39;m on hiatus since couple last couple of weeks, but lack of direction and purpose is awful and with every morning I feel fires of restlessness growing.</p><p>Today I read recruitment ad about neurodiversity program which - supposedly - caters people with different neurodivergencies. Those were US on-site positions though and I&#39;m in EU.</p><p>So getting to the point:
Do you know / can recommend companies with neurodiversity programs?</p><p>For myself obviously I&#39;m looking for remote or EU companies (with relocation) but even if you know something that&#39;s not in the region please feel free to contribute - maybe someone else looking will make use of it.</p><p><i>Obvious throwaway.
