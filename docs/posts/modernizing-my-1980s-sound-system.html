<p>This post is the third in a series of posts on my music setup:</p>

</ul>

<p>Where the last two posts were primarily about <em>software</em>
(<a href="https://www.navidrome.org/">Navidrome</a> and <a href="https://beets.io/"><code>beets</code></a>, respectively),
this post will be more about hardware (and a bit of software to control it). Hopefully
it’ll be useful to others with older sound hardware, especially those who are compelled
(as I am) to avoid buying a “connected” device that’ll stop working after just a few
years<sup id="fnref:incentives" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:incentives" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I used a spare Raspberry Pi (version 3, Model B), an old USB DAC,
and <a href="https://www.hifiberry.com/hifiberryos/">HiFiBerryOS</a> with some unauthorized
patches. As a result, I can now stream to my 1980s speakers from any device on my
LAN, including anything that speaks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPlay">AirPlay</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance">DLNA</a>! To tie things
together, I use <a href="https://github.com/masmu/pulseaudio-dlna"><code>pulseaudio-dlna</code></a> on my desktop
to play music from my Navidrome instance via <a href="https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd">Sonixd</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>A couple of months ago, a relative gave me their old sound system: a pair of KEF C30s
(circa 1985) and a Yamaha RX-495 receiver (circa late 1990s, I think?).</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/kef.jpg" alt="The front page of KEF&#39;s brochure for the C Series"/></p>

<p>As far as speaker tech goes, these are pretty barebones: the C30s are passive monitors,
with a single connector
(two binding post terminals for <a href="https://www.electronicshub.org/types-of-speaker-connections/">banana plugs</a>).</p>

<p>The receiver is slightly fancier: it can hop between radio stations based on signal quality
(fancy!) and has support for 4 “programmable” presets. Nothing compared to modern receivers,
but not the simplest either.</p>

<p>I have fond memories of listening to these speakers as a kid, and I’m loathe
to let perfectly good<sup id="fnref:broken" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:broken" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> hardware get thrown away just because it’s considered obsolete.
I also run my own music server and curate it obsessively, so I thought it would be nice
to have a “serious” listening setup that could stream from my server.</p>

<p>Thus, the plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put the sound system together (no explanation required);</li>
  <li>Figure out how to get music to it “remotely” (meaning, from my server, phone, or other
source);</li>
  <li>Figure out how to control it “remotely” (meaning, pause and play it while sitting in another
room, without just muting it);
    <ul>
      <li>This is a particularly important requirement: I work in another room (usually),
and I’m too lazy to get up and change the music. I want to do it from my computer
or phone.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Ideally</em>, expose it on my home network for houseguests during parties.</li>
  <li><em>Even more ideally</em>, in such a way that they can play their <em>own</em> music, not just whatever
I have on my server.</li>
</ol>

<p>…and, critically, to do it all with only equipment I already own<sup id="fnref:frivolous" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:frivolous" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="failed-attempts">Failed attempts</h2>

<h3 id="attempt-1-connect-a-laptop-to-it">Attempt 1: connect a laptop to it</h3>

<p>This was my first thought: I could just leave a laptop on the same table as
the receiver, connect it as the “aux” source, and people could queue up music as they like.</p>

<p>I didn’t have a spare laptop (they’re all in use), so I pulled my
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_PC#Eee_700_series">Asus Eee 701</a> netbook<sup id="fnref:remember" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:remember" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>
out of the closet and tried to set that up.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/eee-pc.jpg" alt="A picture of the Eee 701."/>
<em>(This thing. Not my picture.)</em></p>

<p>This didn’t go well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It turns out that nothing really runs well on a 32-bit x86 machine anymore,
including major Linux distributions and web browsers. Just getting
Linux installed was a massive pain, much worse than it was the last time
I tried (probably around 2016).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody <em>actually</em> wants to mess around with a plastic netbook to queue up music.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This attempt ended pretty fast.</p>

<h3 id="attempt-2-fm-broadcasting">Attempt 2: FM broadcasting</h3>

<p>The receiver has an FM mode and an FM antenna, and I happen to have a short-range
FM transmitter<sup id="fnref:model" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:model" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. It should have a range of a few dozen feet, so I can set it up
in my office and have it reach the receiver without any problems.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/fm-transmit.jpg" alt="A picture of a CZH-05B FM transmitter."/>
<em>(Again, not my picture, just the same model.)</em></p>

<p>From there, I just need to send music to the transmitter: it has RCA inputs,
so I can adapt those to 3.5mm and adapt to anything common from there.</p>

<p>This worked <em>surprisingly well</em> for my own purposes: I transmitted for a couple of weeks,
using either my computer or my phone as the music source. Still, there were downsides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Pausing playback didn’t actually stop playback: it would stop whatever music
I was listening to, but the FM transmitter would continue to transmit an
empty signal and the receiver would happily “play” it. This led to me forgetting
to turn the receiver off when I wasn’t using it, which in turn led to me
spooking myself whenever I’d turn the transmitter off and FM static would
suddenly fill my apartment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The signal quality was unreliable: normally it was fine, but I could <em>occasionally</em>
hear low static seeping in. I also had to regularly adjust the gain on the transmitter
itself: on some days, I could hear it clipping slightly. I don’t know enough
about radio to understand why either of these would vary, especially in
an apartment interior with relatively thick exterior walls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, nobody wanted to use it. They were amused by the FM transmitter, but
still had to go into another room and physically connect their phone to it
in order to use it, both of which were dealbreakers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="progress-rpi-audio-receiver-and-hifiberryos">Progress: rpi-audio-receiver and HiFiBerryOS</h2>

<p>At this point I remembered that (1) I own a couple of Raspberry Pis, and (2) that they
have onboard audio. I had no idea if that onboard audio is <em>good</em> or not<sup id="fnref:still" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:still" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, but
<strong>surely</strong> someone has tried to use a Raspberry Pi as an audio receiver before?</p>

<p>Google confirms that someone indeed has:
<a href="https://github.com/nicokaiser">Nico Kaiser</a> has a
<a href="https://github.com/nicokaiser/rpi-audio-receiver">project</a> that does <em>exactly</em> that. It even
includes all kinds of goodies that are ideal for guest use, including Bluetooth<sup id="fnref:bluetooth" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bluetooth" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>,
AirPlay, and Spotify Connect support!</p>

<p>There seem to be a decent number of happy users of <code>rpi-audio-receiver</code> on the Internet,
but I didn’t end up as one of them. Instead, <code>rpi-audio-receiver</code>’s README led me
to the <a href="https://github.com/hifiberry/hifiberry-os/">repository for HiFiBerryOS</a>,
which in turn led me to the <a href="https://www.hifiberry.com/">HiFiBerry website</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hifiberryos-website.png" alt="A screenshot of the HiFiBerryOS website."/></p>

<p>This looked like <strong>exactly</strong> what I wanted: a tiny, minimal-configuration distribution
that accepts any number of sound sources and turns them all into a simple analog
signal for my receiver.</p>

<p>To get started, I performed the standard dance of flashing an SD card for my Pi:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td><td><pre><span>$</span><span> </span><span># taken from https://github.com/hifiberry/hifiberry-os/releases</span>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once flashed, I booted the Pi and followed HiFiBerry’s
<a href="https://www.hifiberry.com/docs/hifiberryos/hifiberryos-configure-wifi/">WiFi configuration</a>
steps. This was <em>incredibly</em> nice, since I didn’t need to muck around with an Ethernet cord
or special configuration files<sup id="fnref:raspbian" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:raspbian" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> — I simply connected to the temporary WiFi
network being broadcast by the Pi itself, gave it a name (“leben”), configured a <em>new</em> WiFi network,
and told HiFiBerryOS to forget its own network. It obeyed dutifully, and about a minute later I
had <code>http://hifiberry.local</code>
available on my LAN<sup id="fnref:ethernet" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ethernet" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Critically, I did all of this configuration <strong>from my phone</strong>, which still astounds me: I’ve never had
such a painless experience configuring an OS and hardware before, much less a <em>free</em>
OS running on a dinky little Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h3 id="a-small-setback">A small setback</h3>

<p>At this point, I could actually see the Pi on my network, available as an
AirPlay device:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hifiberry-airplay.jpg" alt="A screenshot of my iPhone&#39;s sound picker, with the Pi as an option."/></p>

<p>I connected to it successfully, hit play on a song, and…nothing happened.</p>

<p>More precisely, the Pi’s little web UI claimed that something was playing
(the metadata is even correct!), but no sound was being produced:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hifiberry-airplay-playing.jpg" alt="The HiFiBerryOS UI claiming that music is playing, but with no sound coming out."/></p>

<p>I initially assumed this was a problem with the Pi’s onboard audio (I’d never used
it before), so I switched to a cheap Griffin “iMic” USB DAC that I’ve had floating
around for years:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/pi-with-dac.jpg" alt="A photo of the Pi plugged into a USB DAC, which is then plugged into a 3.5mm audio jack."/></p>

<p>…and still no audio. I <em>knew</em> that the DAC and the speakers/receiver themselves were working,
so it had to be something about either AirPlay (unlikely, since discovery and metadata exchange
were both working) or HiFiBerryOS itself.</p>

<p>A little bit of Googling later, and I found the reason: HiFiBerryOS
<strong>intentionally does not support</strong> either
<a href="https://support.hifiberry.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360009740718-HiFiBerryOS-how-to-play-through-Pi-s-headphone-jack-">onboard audio</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hifiberryos-onboard.png" alt="A forum posting by an admin explaining that onboard audio is not supported (linked above)."/></p>

<p>…<a href="https://support.hifiberry.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360009257898-Hifiberry-OS-with-USB-DAC">or USB DACs</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hifiberryos-usb.png" alt="Another forum posting explaining that USB DACs are not supported (linked above)."/></p>

<p>This is an understandable position on their part: their revenue seems
to derive primarily from sales of
<a href="https://www.hifiberry.com/shop/">their own sound cards and related equipment</a>,
which they’ve designed and tested to meet their own quality and reliability
standards. Supporting whatever junk people happen to plug in would <em>inevitably</em>
require dedicated engineering resources, as well as fielding support to
frustrated “customers” who haven’t actually bought anything.</p>

<p>As understandable as it is, I was still disappointed — I was <strong>so close</strong>
to completing a sound setup without having to buy any new equipment.</p>

<p>I also <strong>knew</strong> that this limitation in HiFiBerryOS <strong>had</strong> to be in software, not
hardware: it’s all just Linux
(and probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture">ALSA</a>) under the hood,
meaning that USB audio <em>should</em> work right out of the box<sup id="fnref:linux" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:linux" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>. So, I resolved
to hack it together.</p>

<h3 id="hifiberryos-with-a-usb-dac">HiFiBerryOS with a USB DAC</h3>

<p>Fortunately for me, HiFiBerryOS comes with a SSH server installed and running
by default, with default credentials of <code>root:hifiberry</code>.</p>

<p>I shelled in, and confirmed that Linux <em>had</em> indeed registered my USB DAC correctly:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also confirmed my ALSA theory by checking for the “standard” ALSA command-line
tools:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

  Subdevices: 1/1
</span><span>  Subdevice #</span>0: subdevice <span>#0</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, in principle, all I needed to do was figure out how HiFiBerryOS was configuring
ALSA, and tell it to use <code>card 0</code> instead of <code>card 1</code> (which is presumably where the
HiFiBerry would be, if one was installed).</p>

<p>Fortunately, someone on HiFiBerry’s forums
<a href="https://support.hifiberry.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360012029397-HifiBerryOS-and-USB-Soundcard">had already figured this</a>:
there’s a shell script at <code>/opt/hifiberry/bin/reconfigure-players</code> that contains
a <code>detect_hw</code> function like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2

</pre></td><td><pre><span># Find the correct input and output hardware devices</span>

 <span>HW</span><span>=</span><span>`</span>aplay <span>-l</span> | <span>grep </span>hifiberry | <span>awk</span> <span>-F</span>: <span>&#39;{print $1}&#39;</span><span>`</span>

 fix_asound_hw
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…which would normally detect their hat-style DAC on <code>card 1</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>#</span><span> </span>aplay <span>-l</span> | <span>grep </span>hifiberry | <span>awk</span> <span>-F</span>: <span>&#39;{print $1}&#39;</span>
<span>card 1
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To “fix” it, all I had to do was patch <code>detect_hw</code> to discover <code>card 0</code> instead,
which I did by <code>grep</code>ing for the “iMic” string instead of “hifiberry”:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2

4

<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I saved the file, used the HiFiBerry OS Web UI to reboot the Pi,
tried playing a song again and…it worked!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scr82AwOssA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

  <em>Click to play on YouTube.</em>
</a></p>

<h2 id="streaming-from-my-linux-desktop">Streaming from my Linux desktop</h2>

<p>This made me <em>very</em> happy: I could now stream from my phone, as could anybody
else on my home LAN.</p>

<p>macOS also worked right out of the box, presumably via the same kind of AirPlay
discovery.</p>

<p>That only leaves my desktop, which runs Linux (specifically, Ubuntu LTS). I already
have a nice <em>local</em> player setup there (streaming from Navidrome using
<a href="https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd">Sonixd</a>), and I’d <em>ideally</em> I’d reuse it
without any substantial changes.</p>

<p>As far as Linux audio goes, the solution here was <strong>shockingly</strong> easy:
I use PulseAudio for my desktop audio and HiFiBerryOS supports DLNA streaming,
so I installed <a href="https://github.com/masmu/pulseaudio-dlna"><code>pulseaudio-dlna</code></a>
and ran it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install</span> <span>-y</span> pulseaudio-dlna
<span>$</span><span> </span>pulseaudio-dlna
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This <em>immediately</em> discovered the Pi and added it to my PulseAudio sinks,
allowing me to set it as my default via <code>pavucontrol</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/leben-dlna.png" alt="A screenshot of pavucontrol, showing the DLNA sink."/></p>

<p>Once again, I played a song…and everything worked again! The latency between
play/pause toggles is noticeable (about 1.5 seconds), but that’s not a dealbreaker for me.</p>

<p>As a curiosity, streaming via <code>pulseaudio-dlna</code> makes HiFiBerryOS think it’s receiving
from a Chromium instance:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/leben-chromium.png" alt="A screen should of the Web UI, showing that it thinks Chromium is streaming."/></p>

<p>(This again doesn’t matter to me, since I don’t plan on checking the Web UI much. But it’s funny.)</p>

<h2 id="summary-and-next-steps">Summary and next steps</h2>

<p>To summarize, I now have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Navidrome running on a local server, providing a
<a href="http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp">Subsonic-style API</a>…</li>
  <li>…which I connect to via Sonixd running on my hosts (both macOS and Linux)…</li>
  <li>…which streams via Airplay or DLNA to a Raspberry Pi running HiFiBerryOS…</li>
  <li>…which is patched to use a crappy USB DAC…</li>
  <li>…which terminates in a 3.5mm jack, adapting to RCA to go into my receiver…</li>
  <li>…which then controls and powers my speakers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The end result: anybody on my network (including friends and family during parties)
can take over the “aux” without needing to find the cable, mess with Bluetooth
pairings, &amp;c — all they need is to be on my WiFi. An of course,
selfishly and lazily, I no longer have to move 20 feet to change the music. Progress!</p>

<p>I’ve been working on and using open source software for a while now,
but this little weekend project <em>really</em> drove home the value of open standards
and free, pluggable, reusable work from hobbyists (like myself): I was able
to do reuse hardware and software that I already owned and had configured,
without having to worry about planned obsolescence or woeful security
practices by random companies that feel the need to add “smarts” or Internet
connectivity to their products<sup id="fnref:security" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:security" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>.</p>

<p>There are still some things I’d like to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>pulseaudio-dlna</code> is working very nicely for me, but (based on development
activity) it seems to be mostly inactive. It’s probably not a long-term
solution for me (although there is an <a href="https://github.com/Cygn/pulseaudio-dlna">active fork</a>).</p>

    <p>Longer term, instead, I’d like to unify on AirPlay for all my devices.
It looks like there’s <em>some</em> support for this in PulseAudio already, via the
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Modules/#raopsinkmoduleswirelessnetworksoundakaappleairtunes">RAOP modules</a>
for streaming and the
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Modules/#module-zeroconf-discover">Zeroconf discovery module</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe I’ll try and get Bluetooth working as well. This will probably need
a separate dongle and it’s not clear that HiFiBerryOS supports it on my Pi model,
but we’ll see.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The receiver has its own volume control (naturally), along with an IR remote
that can control it. It’d be interesting to try and clone the signals
for volume control, so that I can also control the volume remotely.</p>

    <p>I got a kick out of hacking around HiFiBerry’s own hardware restrictions, but
I feel bad about it: they’ve put an <em>incredible</em> amount of effort into
both their hardware and software, and I’m using it for free in a way they
didn’t intend (even if it’s within my rights). Also, while it was nice
to get things working with the USB DAC, it’s <em>very</em> crappy and not a long-term
solution.</p>

    <p>As such, I’m going to buy one of HiFiBerry’s own in-house DACs, as well
as a case to house the whole setup. I encourage anybody else who reads
this post to do the same, circumstances permitting.</p>

<p>I’ll probably do a successor post for those, at some point.</p>

<p>Finally, I’m going to plug the <a href="https://ko-fi.com/">Ko-fi</a> donation pages
