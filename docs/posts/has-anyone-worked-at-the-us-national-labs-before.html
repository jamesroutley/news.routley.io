    <h1>Ask HN: Has anyone worked at the US National Labs before?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have spent the last 10 years working for FAANG companies, but nowadays I find their performance-review and promotion obsessed cultures to be really draining. Worse, those negative feelings seem to be leaking into my personal life and slowly alienating friends and family.</p><p>Therefore, I&#39;ve been pondering a change of pace. The classic HN answer is of course &#34;create/join a startup&#34;, but I&#39;ve also been looking at areas more adjacent to scientific research.</p><p>One option that has come up is the US Department of Energy&#39;s national laboratory network[0]. From what I understand, the pay is 33-50% of FAANG, but they do seem to have interesting projects (e.g. the nuclear fusion facility that was recently in the news).</p><p>Has anyone here worked at one of them before? What is/was the day-to-day like?</p><p>[0] <a href="https://www.energy.gov/national-laboratories" rel="nofollow">https://www.energy.gov/national-laboratories</a></p></div></div></div>
