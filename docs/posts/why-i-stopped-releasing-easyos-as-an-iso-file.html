<p>Some time ago I stopped releasing EasyOS as an ISO file, from then 
onward as a drive image file only. This has been contentious, and I 
receive emails from people lamenting the demise of the ISO. So, I should
 post some thoughts why I made this decision. Not an exhaustive 
rationale, just some thoughts while I think of them right now...<br/>
</p>

<p>The ISO9660 file format is very old, going right back to 1988, and has since then had enhancements bolted on, see the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660">Wikipedia ISO9660 page</a>.
 In addition, there is the &#34;hybrid ISO&#34;, enabling booting from a 
USB-stick, and on top of that enhancements to enable booting from either
 or both legacy-BIOS and UEFI firmware computers, see <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Isohybrid">here</a>.<br/>
</p>

<p>What all of the above means is that ISO files are a &#34;dogs breakfast&#34;, a hodge podge of changes bolted on over the years.<br/>
</p>

<p>A Linux distribution provided on a drive image file, in comparison, 
is very simple. And, very simple to setup to boot on either or both 
legacy-BIOS and UEFI computers.<br/>
</p>

<p>Given that optical drives are rapidly receeding into history, and 
these days we boot from either a USB-stick or install direct to a hard 
drive partition, what are the differences in doing that, ISO versus 
image file? <br/>
</p>
<p>
In the case of booting from USB-stick, the answer is: <SPAN size="+1"><b><SPAN color="#cc0000">none</SPAN></b></SPAN><br/>
</p>
<p>You need a tool for writing the file, ISO or image-file, to the 
USB-stick, and plenty of such tools are available. For example, &#39;Etcher&#39;
 available on Windows, Mac and Linux, &#39;easydd&#39; on Linux, or on Linux you
 can even use the &#39;dd&#39; utility.<br/>
</p>

<p>As you are no longer writing to an optical media, you don&#39;t use a 
CD/DVD burner tool. That is the only change that you have to make.<br/>
</p>
<p>Having written the file to the USB-stick, ISO or drive-image, you 
need to configure the PC to boot from it, and you are in business.<br/>
</p>


<p>So why the incredible amount of opposition to the drive-image-file? 
That is an very interesting question, that puzzled me for a long time. 
OK, some more thoughts...<br/>
</p>

<h2>The ISO file is a &#34;wrong fit&#34; for a USB-stick<br/>
</h2>

<p>The iso file is a complete self-contained package. Let&#39;s say that you
 write a 550MB hybrid-ISO file to a 16GB USB-stick. This is what will be
 on the USB-stick:<br/>
</p>



<p>Why is creating a USB-stick that is mostly unusable, considered to be
 acceptable by most mainline Linux distributions? Simply because they 
only want to be able to boot the distribution for the purpose of 
installing it to a internal hard drive. So, they don&#39;t care that the 
rest of the USB-stick is unusable.<br/>
</p>

<p>On the other hand, a live-CD type of distribution, like Puppy Linux, 
it is an issue, because the &#34;save file&#34; can only be created on some 
other drive, usually an internal drive. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if the &#34;save
 file&#34; or &#34;save folder&#34; could be on the USB-stick, or rather it would be
 nice if you had that choice.<br/>
</p>

<p>With a drive-image, the entire USB-stick is available. The EasyOS 
drive image has two partitions, a vfat &#34;boot partition&#34; and a ext4 
&#34;working partition&#34;. Initially, the working-partition is only 640MB, but
 at first bootup it automatically expands to fill the drive. So, this is
 what you have on the 16GB USB-stick:<br/>
</p>

<table>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>boot<br/>
      </td>
      <td> --working-partition, using entire drive--<br/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>...think about the implication of that for a moment. Unlike 
traditional Puppy, you don&#39;t have to try and decide where to create a 
&#34;save file&#34;. It already exists, as a &#34;save folder&#34; in the 
working-partition. <b><SPAN color="#cc0000">First bootup and you are in business, nothing else to do</SPAN></b>. <br/>
</p>

<p>And, you never again have to worry about the size of your &#34;save 
file&#34;. At first bootup you have automatically got the entire drive to 
play in.<br/>
</p>
<p>This is momentous, and thanks to Dima (forum member &#39;dimkr&#39;), our 
most prolific woof-CE developer, the next-generation Puppy will be a 
drive-image only.<br/>
</p>


<h2>Why so much opposition to dropping the ISO file?<br/>
</h2>

<p>Dima and myself both receive regular messages expressing opposition 
to dropping ISO files. In my case, mostly by email. In a couple of 
cases, the person has been most persistent, periodically expressing 
their opposition.<br/>
</p>

<p>What I have observed is that those persistent individuals are Puppy old-timers, <i>very</i>
 old-timers. A couple of them are in their 80s, and they have a 
collection of vintage PCs, all with optical drives. Optical media, 
CD/DVD, ISO files, that&#39;s what they know. And they ain&#39;t gonna change.<br/>
</p>

<p>I am reminded of my step-mother, currently residing in a nursing 
home. She is 88, and still uses a keyboard flip-phone and an audio 
cassette player. When the telco dropped support for 3G, I bought her an 
Android touch phone. Despite very careful instruction, and even writing 
down simple steps to make a call, etc., I could see her eyes glazing 
over. She just didn&#39;t want to know, and after awhile I had to buy her 
another keyboard flip-phone.<br/>
</p>

<p>Ditto with her little portable cassette player. Recently it stopped 
working and I had to buy another one from China. I did try to introduce 
her to mp3 files a few years ago, but nup, didn&#39;t want to know.<br/>
</p>

<p>About a year ago, I received an email from a representative of a 
German Linux magazine. I think that magazine still ships printed 
magazines with a CD stuck on the front. Anyway, he wanted to review 
EasyOS and had some questions, and I replied, yeah, go for it.<br/>
</p>

<p>But, I became increasingly puzzled by his questions. They didn&#39;t make
 any sense. The penny finally dropped when I realised that he didn&#39;t 
have a clue what a Linux distribution on a drive-image file is. His 
knowledge was ISOs, ISOs and ISOs.<br/>
</p>

<p>...that taught me that even Linux experts, people who review Linux 
distributions, may have severe misunderstandings outside of their 
beloved ISO format.<br/>
</p>

<h2>In conclusion<br/>
</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, the mainline distributions may stick with ISO 
format just because they have no compelling reason to change. They just 
want to boot the CD/DVD and then install their distribution to an 
internal drive.<br/>
</p>

<p>Other than that use-case, ISO has had it&#39;s day, and should be retired.<br/>
</p>

<p>Oh yes, there are some old computers that won&#39;t boot from USB, well 
they are ancient and approaching relegation to &#34;Silicon Heaven&#34; (you 
need to be a fan of the Red Dwarf TV series to know what <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://reddwarf.fandom.com/wiki/Silicon_Heaven">Silicon Heaven</a> is).<br/>
</p>

<p>There are some multi-boot tools, that enable putting many ISO files 
on the one USB-stick. I have never used them, and don&#39;t see the point of
 them, unless you are a crazed disto-hopper.<br/>
</p>

<p>I cannot think of a single other use-case where you would want to stay with ISO files.<br/>
</p>

<p>For Linux developers, if you are interested, I have a script for 
creating a skeleton drive-image file, with a boot-partition and a 
working-partition, that will boot on either a legacy-BIOS or a modern 
UEFI PC. There are three scripts, &#39;2createpcskeletonimage&#39;, 
&#39;2createpcskeletonimage-encrypt&#39; and &#39;2createpcskeletonimage-gpt&#39; -- for
 easyOS I currently use the middle one, which creates a MSDOS partition 
table and enables ext4 fscrypt in the working-partition. Syslinux is 
used for legacy-BIOS booting, rEFInd for UEFI booting. These scripts are
 in the woofQ tarball, available <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://distro.ibiblio.org/easyos/project/woofq/">here</a>.<br/>
</p>
<p>

Dima has a similar script. He is using Syslinux and Efilinux.</p>

<p>What motivated me to create this blog post, is discussion starting here on the Puppy Forum:</p>
