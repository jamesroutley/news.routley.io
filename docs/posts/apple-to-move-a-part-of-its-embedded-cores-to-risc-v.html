    <h1>Apple to Move a Part of Its Embedded Cores to RISC-V</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis sources, Apple is moving its embedded cores from Arm to RISC-V. In Apple&#39;s Silicon designs, there are far more cores than the main ones that power the operating system and end-user applications. For example, embedded cores are present, and there are <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1557233812954038272" target="_blank">30+ in M1 SoCs</a> responsible for all kinds of workloads not related to the operating system. These tasks are usually associated with other functions such as WiFi/BlueTooth, ThunderBolt retiming, touchpad control, NAND chips having their own core, etc. They run their own firmware and power everything around the central cores that run the OS, so the whole SoC functions appropriately.</p></div></div>
