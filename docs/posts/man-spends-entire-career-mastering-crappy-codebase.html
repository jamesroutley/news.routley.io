    <h1>Man spends entire career mastering crappy codebase</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
This week, software developer Arthur Westbook announced his early retirement at
age 58.</p>
<p>
Westbrook spent 35 years in a codebase that allegedly powers some sort of
medical software somewhere. During his tenure, he contributed hundreds of lines
of code. Westbrook once touched legacy code without ending the company.</p>
<p>
Westbrook believes he grapsed over 4% of the entire codebase. A former colleague
called it “the War &amp; Peace of wingdings”.</p>
<p>
In the company, Westbrook was known as “one of the programmers on the team”. His
manager noted, “Arthur had a knack for working hard without learning
transferrable skills. He will be dearly missed. It’ll take two junior devs and a
Keurig to replace him.”</p>
<p>
In honor of his decades of service, one of his coworkers will take him out for
drinks “sometime next month”. Nobody on his team responded for comment.</p>
<p>
For his retirement, Westbrook plans to dabble in street performance and dumpster
diving. He also plans to hone his culinary creation: Soylent mixed with Whole
Foods Premium Adult Cat Salmon Mix.</p>
