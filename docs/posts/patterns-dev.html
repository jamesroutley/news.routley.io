            We offer a modern perspective on patterns
          </h3>
          <p>
            A common critique of design patterns is that they needlessly add
            complexity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our perspective is that patterns are valuable for solving specific
            problems, often helping to 
            <strong>communicate comminalities in code problems</strong> for humans.
            If a project doesn&#39;t have those problems, there isn&#39;t a need
            to apply them. Patterns can also be very language or framework-specific
            (e.g. React), which can often mean thinking beyond the scope of just
            the original GoF design patterns.
