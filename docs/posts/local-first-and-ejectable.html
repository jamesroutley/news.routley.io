            <p>An important requirement to ensure you can fully access your data in cloud apps forever is making the backend sync server available for local self-hosting. That&#39;s what <i>EJECTABLE</i> apps are about.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/">Local-first</a> allows users to enjoy all the benefits cloud apps bring (like seamless real-time collaboration, syncing, auto backups) while keeping the data ownership aspect from traditional desktop software.</p>
            
            <p>The problem is that&#39;s just the <i>data</i> part. What about the longevity of the <i>service</i>, the app itself, to use the data with? With traditional desktop software the full set of features remains available when a company shuts down. When a cloud app shuts down, or <i>enshittifies</i>, or you simply want to leave, you&#39;re left with the data (hopefully) but no good way to use it. All the functionality that&#39;s part of the cloud part of the app, features like syncing or collaboration are gone.</p>
            
            <p>An ejectable app allows users to &#34;eject&#34; at any time and switch to self-hosting (or vice versa) by:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Saving a <tt>workspace.zip</tt>, which contains all their state.</li>
            <li>Downloading a <tt>server.exe</tt>/<tt>.bin</tt> to self-host the backend sync server (possibly even picking their favorite version of the app).</li>
            <li>Being able to run the server executable locally. This should allow you to simply open the workspace data and continue where you left off.</li>
            <li>Making the ejection fully reversible, because the freedom to leave the cloud version with no way back is still a hurdle to using it. Eject from the self-hosted version, sign up for the cloud version and import again.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Making apps local-first and ejectable should give us the best of both worlds: the convenience and features of cloud-based apps while being as future proof as <tt>DOOM.EXE</tt> or <tt>NOTEPAD.EXE</tt> from decades ago. 

                
            They ensure that what we create with our modern tools today remains accessible and functional far into the future
            
                
                (of course we&#39;re building <a href="https://thymer.com/">Thymer</a> as an ejectable app, too).</p>
