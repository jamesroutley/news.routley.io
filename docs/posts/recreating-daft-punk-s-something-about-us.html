        <p><strong>Marca Tatem</strong><em> </em>— San Francisco, April 3rd, 2025</p><p>After years of finding it confusing and unintuitive, I finally gave <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Ableton Live</strong></a> another shot. With <strong>version 12</strong> (current as of this writing), it feels significantly more refined—so much so that it&#39;s officially become my DAW of choice.</p><p>When learning a new music production software, recreating a cover track is always a smart move. You don&#39;t have to worry too much about the songwriting itself, which frees you up to focus on the tools and the production process.</p><p>For this project, I picked a track that&#39;s emblematic of the<strong> French Touch</strong> movement and now nearing its 25th anniversary: <strong>Daft Punk&#39;s </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOS9aOIXPEk&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong><em>Something About Us</em></strong></a>. Rebuilding it in a modern production environment turned out to be trickier than I expected, but here&#39;s how it went, track by track.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="wait-whats-the-french-touch-anyway">Wait... What&#39;s the French Touch, Anyway?</h2><p>To me, <strong>French Touch</strong> isn&#39;t just a genre—it&#39;s a <em>cultural artifact</em> born from a very specific time and place: France in the late <strong>&#39;70s</strong> and <strong>&#39;80s</strong>. Its distinct sound is the product of a generation raised on <em>analog dreams of the digital future</em>.</p><p>These artists—<strong>Daft Punk</strong>, <strong>Justice</strong>, <strong>Kavinsky</strong>, and others—grew up immersed in a bizarre and colorful media landscape. Japanese TV shows like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV2yjpuPjaU&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><em>X-OR</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amrDS3CvrNI&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><em>Sankukai</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROXpxDtKv7o&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><em>Albator 84</em></a> filled French screens with space corsairs, robotic heroes, and mythological remixes set in futuristic worlds. Their themes were packed with synths, arpeggiators, and digitized voices—sounds that now echo, with a grown-up edge, in the textures of <strong>French Touch</strong> music.</p><p>At the same time, France was pushing into the future: science museums, open-air <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRO2EtDQ_nA&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io">electronic concerts by pioneers like <strong>Jean-Michel Jarre</strong></a>, and a sense that the 21st century was just around the corner. Yet beneath that techno-utopian veneer, cities like Paris remained gritty and raw. That tension—between the shiny and the grimy—runs deep in the DNA of <strong>French Touch</strong>. You hear it, especially in the darker, distorted edges of <strong>Justice</strong> and <strong>Kavinsky</strong>.</p><p>Let&#39;s also not forget the artists who laid the groundwork long before the <strong>French Touch</strong> became a thing. Quirky French electronic pioneers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3wVHiqP9g&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Jacno</strong></a>, the retro-futurist charm of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OpnRuooGfw&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Telex</strong></a> from Belgium, and, of course,<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-HqE1VdPgA&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Giorgio Moroder</strong></a>, the godfather of <strong>Italo Disco</strong>—all contributed textures, tones, and sensibilities that would echo decades later. Even mainstream pop acts like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJZ1G0e5bWU&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Lio</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqeJUGzvnq0&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Étienne Daho</strong></a>, or the orchestral-synth hybrids of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4FrnrD7jCA&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Rondo Veneziano</strong></a> were constantly spinning on French FM radio, which in the &#39;80s was a chaotic, genre-blurring space. This eclectic mix quietly wired an entire generation of young listeners with an appetite for melody, groove, and synthetic textures—key ingredients in what would later become <strong>French Touch</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/outrun.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1536" height="1024" srcset="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/outrun.png 600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/outrun.png 1000w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/outrun.png 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Outrun never looked as good as in your dreams</span></figcaption></figure><p>There&#39;s also a certain <em>California dreamin</em>g that runs through much of <strong>French Touch</strong>. The imagery of Los Angeles—<em>endless boulevards flanked by towering palm trees and that golden sunset light</em>—is a romanticized vision of America that influenced the aesthetic, especially in later works. This fusion of European electronic sensibilities with American dream imagery created something uniquely transportive.</p><p>What started as a movement became a signature sound: <em>nostalgic, futuristic, cinematic, dirty, emotional.</em></p><h2 id="why-it-was-so-hard-to-recreate">Why It Was So Hard to Recreate</h2><p>Part of what makes <strong>French Touch</strong> so compelling is also what makes it hard to replicate today. Those<em> lush, imperfect textures</em> weren&#39;t just stylistic choices—they were the natural result of a specific time, place, and set of tools. Many of these tracks were recorded in a single take, often in cramped Parisian apartments or modest studios, using vintage analog gear and early digital samplers.</p><p>There&#39;s a rawness and spontaneity to that process. The <em>hiss of a dusty synth</em>, the <em>unquantized groove of a looped disco break</em>, the warmth of <em>tape compression</em>—all of it baked into the DNA of those tracks. Today’s high-resolution digital tools are often too clean, too precise. When you remove the imperfections, you also risk scrubbing out the soul.</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/124DC7C1-7FAF-427F-9C62-8B637496C697_1_102_a.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/124DC7C1-7FAF-427F-9C62-8B637496C697_1_102_a.jpeg 600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/124DC7C1-7FAF-427F-9C62-8B637496C697_1_102_a.jpeg 1000w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/124DC7C1-7FAF-427F-9C62-8B637496C697_1_102_a.jpeg 1600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/124DC7C1-7FAF-427F-9C62-8B637496C697_1_102_a.jpeg 2364w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>The Ableton Live&#39;s session</span></figcaption></figure><p>So when I set out to recreate <em>Something About Us</em> using modern software, I knew that recreating this track would be more than just copying notes or layering samples—I’d have to <em>chase a feeling</em>.</p><h2 id="the-keys">The Keys</h2><p>In the original track, the keyboard part is likely played on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wurlitzer_electronic_piano?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Wurlitzer</strong></a><strong> electric piano</strong>—its <em>signature bite and warmth</em> are unmistakable. For my version, I opted for something slightly different: a warmer, more rounded tone using the excellent <a href="https://www.skystudiosplugins.com/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>S.K.Y. Keys plugin</strong></a>, specifically the <em>Everything Right</em> preset. It doesn&#39;t try to mimic the original exactly but brings a vibe that fits the song&#39;s emotional core.</p><p>I kept the processing minimal: just a gentle midrange boost (mainly to make the part shine a bit more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley_face_curve?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>AirPods</strong></a>), a touch of Ableton&#39;s stock <strong>Vinyl Distortion</strong> for added warmth, and <strong>side-chain compression</strong> tied to the kick for subtle movement in the mix. After the intro section, I remove the bass note from the keys to carve out space for the actual bassline to enter cleanly.</p><p>Here&#39;s what that part sounds like, dry and uncompressed:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/keys_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"/></p></div><h2 id="drums">Drums</h2><p>The drum part in <em>Something About Us</em> is deceptively simple. For this project, I built a custom kit: the <strong>kick</strong> comes from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-505?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Roland TR-505</strong></a>, the <strong>closed hi-hats</strong> are from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>TR-808</strong></a>, and I kept the <strong>open hi-hat</strong> from the stock<strong> TR-505</strong> sounds. It’s a classic combo that delivers the crisp, laid-back groove the track needs.</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/IMG_1131-1.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1381" srcset="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/IMG_1131-1.jpeg 600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/IMG_1131-1.jpeg 1000w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/IMG_1131-1.jpeg 1600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/IMG_1131-1.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>My Arturia Beatstep Pro</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now—the <strong>snare</strong>. This one was tough. I spent a long time trying to recreate it, convinced it was a processed acoustic snare layered with something synthetic. After too many failed attempts, I caved and sampled the original. Yes, the snare is the only part I couldn’t fully replicate.</p><p>To isolate it, I used an AI stem-splitting tool called <a href="https://www.landr.com/plugins/landr-stems?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>LANDR Stems</strong>,</a> which did a surprisingly clean job of pulling the drum track apart from the rest of the mix.</p><p>Here&#39;s the full drum pattern:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Drums_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"/></p></div><p>Here&#39;s the final snare sample, isolated:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Snare_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"/></p></div><p>In terms of processing, I applied <strong>compression</strong> to give the groove some punch and then ran the whole drum track through a <strong>tape emulation</strong> plugin (<a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/trtapemac24/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Tape Machine 24</strong></a> from IK Multimedia) to smooth out the transients and give it that slightly worn-in warmth.</p><h2 id="bassline">Bassline</h2><p>Like the drums, the bassline in <em>Something About Us</em> is incredibly minimal—just a straightforward <strong>octave pattern</strong>, no ghost notes. It&#39;s tightly quantized and split across two layers that work together to form the full tone.</p><p>The <strong>low octave</strong> is a simple synth—nothing fancy. I used Ableton&#39;s stock <strong>Operator</strong> with the <em>Guitar Bass</em> preset as a starting point. A bit of EQ boosts the low mids and rolls off everything below 40Hz, and it sits nicely in the mix.</p><p>The <strong>high octave</strong>, on the other hand, comes from a sampled electric bass. I recorded a single plucked note on my own bass, loaded it into <strong>Simpler</strong>, activated Warping, and that was enough to get the right texture.</p><p>I grouped both tracks and ran them through a <strong>Glue Compressor</strong>, side-chained to the drum track for a bit of breathing and bounce. It&#39;s clean, tight, and fits under the keys without stepping on anything.</p><p>Here&#39;s the bassline coupled with drums:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Drums-and-Bass_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"/></p></div><p>Here&#39;s the bassline soloed.</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Bass_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"/></p></div><h2 id="the-cocotte">The Cocotte</h2><p>One of the more unique textures in <em>Something About Us</em> is what we in France call a <em>&#34;cocotte&#34;</em>—a muted, rhythmic funk guitar riff, aka <strong>chicken guitar</strong>. In this case, it&#39;s processed through a <strong>Talkbox</strong>, which gives it that vocal, filtered tone.</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/00C0D7EA-02BB-46CC-96C7-A738C7E4824E_1_102_a.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/00C0D7EA-02BB-46CC-96C7-A738C7E4824E_1_102_a.jpeg 600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/00C0D7EA-02BB-46CC-96C7-A738C7E4824E_1_102_a.jpeg 1000w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/00C0D7EA-02BB-46CC-96C7-A738C7E4824E_1_102_a.jpeg 1600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/00C0D7EA-02BB-46CC-96C7-A738C7E4824E_1_102_a.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>My old, beaten Talkbox</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you&#39;re unfamiliar with a <strong>Talkbox</strong>, it&#39;s essentially a tiny speaker pushing sound through a plastic tube into your mouth. You shape the sound using your mouth movements, almost like playing a <em>mouth harp</em>, and that modulated sound is then picked up by a microphone. It&#39;s been famously used by artists like <a href="https://youtu.be/L_CBZkd2tGE?t=31&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Zapp &amp; Roger</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c3N_0a_WJc&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Stevie Wonder</strong></a>, and of course, <strong>Daft Punk</strong>.</p><p>I must admit something: while I consider <strong>Daft Punk&#39;s</strong> first two albums absolute masterpieces, I&#39;ve never been a huge fan of their guitar tones—especially their later collaborations with <strong>Nile Rodgers</strong>. There&#39;s nothing technically wrong with them, but I prefer funk guitars that are punchier, more percussive, and full-bodied. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtzBduHNol8&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Yarol Poupaud’s</strong></a> work with <strong>FFF</strong> is more my jam—or, even closer to home, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzjJQs9jHBY&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Nicolas Bogue</strong></a>, <strong>Breakbot&#39;s</strong> guitarist, who taught me everything I know about <strong>funk guitar</strong> when I was a teenager.</p><p>In <em>Something About Us,</em> the cocotte is very subdued—the ghost notes are barely there, almost unnaturally so. That may have been intentional, but I wanted to bring a little more texture and bounce into my version.</p><p>I recorded the part using a <strong>Les Paul</strong> through <a href="https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/guitar/guitar-rig-7-pro/amps-and-cabinets/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Guitar Rig&#39;s</strong></a><strong> &#34;High White&#34;</strong> amp sim (a <strong>Hiwatt</strong> emulation), with a touch of cabinet (around 5%) to keep it from sounding too boxy. The space and depth come mostly from reverb, sent through a bus using <a href="https://www.wavealchemy.co.uk/product/magic7/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Wave Alchemy&#39;s Magic 7</strong></a> (a lush emulation of the <a href="https://www.bricasti.com/en/pro/m7.php?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Bricasti M7</strong></a>).</p><p>Here&#39;s the cocotte soloed:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Cocotte_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"/></p></div><h2 id="the-wakawak">The Wakawak</h2><p>Okay, I couldn&#39;t think of a better name for this one—<em>Wakawak</em> just fits. It&#39;s a synthetic take on a trimmed <strong>funk guitar chord</strong>, dripping in <strong>reverb</strong> and slapped with a tightly <strong>synced, panned echo</strong>. It&#39;s playful and rhythmic and adds a little magic sparkle in the background.</p><p>This sound was one of the trickiest to get right. It took quite a bit of back-and-forth. At its core, it&#39;s a <strong>synth patch</strong> designed to mimic that snappy, vocal-like quality you&#39;d get from a well-timed guitar chop.</p><p>The patch starts with a simple waveform in Ableton Live&#39;s <strong>Wavetable</strong>, shaped by a smooth, triangle-like <strong>LFO</strong> that modulates both the amplitude and filter cutoff frequency, creating the signature pulsing movement. To add a bit more funk character, I ran it through an <strong>envelope filter stompbox</strong> emulation, which gave it a gritty, slightly overdriven sweep—more like a dusty analog auto-wah you&#39;d find on an old pedalboard than a pristine digital effect.</p><p>The spacey vibe comes from a stock Ableton <strong>Delay</strong> on a send bus, <strong>panned hard right</strong> and set to <strong>tempo-sync</strong>. Tons of reverb helps it blend into the background without losing presence.</p><p>Here&#39;s the Wakawaka soloed:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Wakawaka_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"/></p></div><h2 id="the-theme">The Theme</h2><p>This lead sound—<em>silly, playful, and deceptively simple</em>—was surprisingly difficult to pin down. After quite a bit of experimenting, I landed on something pretty close using <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/software-instruments/jun-6-v/overview?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Arturia&#39;s Jun-6V</strong></a>, their emulation of the iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Juno-60?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Roland Juno-6</strong></a>.</p><p>That<em> soft, rubbery tone</em> with just a hint of analog instability is key to the emotional feel of <em>Something About Us</em>. While you can approximate it using Ableton Live&#39;s <strong>Operator</strong> with the <em>Analog Bouquet</em> preset, it still lacks the warmth and nuance of a proper analog emulation.</p><p>Here&#39;s the theme soloed:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Theme_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"/></p></div><h2 id="the-guitar-solo">The Guitar Solo</h2><p>The <em>silky, melancholic guitar solo</em> is one of the emotional peaks of <em>Something About Us</em>. While I can&#39;t say for sure, I&#39;d wager the original was played on a <strong>hollow or semi-hollow body guitar</strong>—you can hear that smooth resonance and airy tone in the phrasing.</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/IMG_1128.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/IMG_1128.jpeg 600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/IMG_1128.jpeg 1000w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/IMG_1128.jpeg 1600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2025/04/IMG_1128.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>My humble Honey burst Les Paul ❤️</span></figcaption></figure><p>For my version, I recorded the solo <em>ad-lib</em> on my <strong>Les Paul</strong>, and I was lucky enough to stumble upon a preset in <strong>Guitar Rig</strong> that felt just right. I gave it a few subtle tweaks, adding in simulated hum and noise via the <strong>Noise Machine</strong> rack to inject a bit of vintage character and imperfection.</p><p>I ran it through a <strong>compressor</strong> to even out dynamics and used <strong>Raum</strong>, also in <strong>Guitar Rig</strong>, for some warm, spacey reverb that lets the notes breathe without feeling too polished.</p><p>Here&#39;s the guitar solo (with the keys):</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Solo_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"/></p></div><h2 id="the-vocals">The Vocals</h2><h3 id="lead">Lead</h3><p>Ah yes—the vocals. Now<em> that&#39;s</em> a big one. First, I genuinely believe you can&#39;t fully replicate the vocal texture of the original unless you&#39;re <em>slightly sick</em>—it&#39;s got that warm, congested, <strong>Vick Vaporub feel</strong>.</p><p>I tried a few approaches, including a <strong>vocoder</strong>, but it ended up sounding too synthetic. Even with careful dry/wet blending, it was either too robotic or too clean—and in both cases, it lost clarity.</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/IMG_1129.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2000" srcset="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/IMG_1129.jpeg 600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/IMG_1129.jpeg 1000w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/IMG_1129.jpeg 1600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2025/04/IMG_1129.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>A dreamy vocal booth</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the end, I went with a more organic solution: I tracked the vocals in my apartment in the Mission, San Francisco, and used Ableton&#39;s <strong>Auto Filter</strong> to sculpt the tone dynamically. I automated the filter to <strong>gradually open</strong> during the second half of each phrase, and <strong>close it sharply</strong> at the start of the next one—giving the vocal that breathing, evolving texture. I also played around with the filter automation on specific words like<em> &#34;do&#34;</em> and <em>&#34;you&#34;</em> in the phrase <em>&#34;I&#39;ve got to do/share with you.&#34;</em> It&#39;s not perfect, but it captures the vibe.</p><h3 id="harmonies">Harmonies</h3><p>There&#39;s a beautiful, super-typical Daft Punk harmony on <em>&#34;right one&#34;</em> and <em>&#34;right time&#34;</em> in the second verse—possibly vocoded in the original. It took me a while to figure out the voicings (I&#39;m no music theory wizard), but after some trial and error, I got something I&#39;m really happy with. <em>&#34;Right one&#34;</em> might still be a little off, but I think I nailed <em>&#34;right time&#34;</em>—and let&#39;s be honest, that&#39;s <strong>the pretty one</strong>.</p><p>I filtered the harmonies using <strong>Auto Filter</strong> again, bounced them down to a stereo track, and used the <em>Wide Stereo</em> preset in Ableton&#39;s <strong>Utility</strong> plugin to give them that spread. Add a bit of <strong>Magic 7 reverb</strong> on a bus, and boom—they melt right into the mix.</p><p>Here are the harmonies soloed:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Harmonies_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"/></p></div><p>Here they are with the lead vocals:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Harmonies-and-Main_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"/></p></div><h3 id="vocoder">Vocoder</h3><p>For the final section, I went <em>full robot</em>. I used a stock <strong>Operator</strong> synth as the carrier, routed it into Ableton&#39;s stock <strong>Vocoder</strong>, and processed the output with a <strong>high-pass filter</strong> and the <strong>Chorus-Ensemble</strong> plugin to give it more dimension and movement.</p><p>The vocoder is mixed in with the dry vocal until the balance feels just right—enough to sound synthetic but emotionally grounded. Basically, it ends up sounding like <em>a little robot backing me up with its heart on its sleeve.</em></p><p>Here&#39;s the vocoder soloed:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Vocoder_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"/></p></div><p>And here&#39;s the vocoder blended with the lead:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Vocoder-and-Main_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"/></p></div><h2 id="from-paris-to-san-francisco-a-personal-note">From Paris to San Francisco: A Personal Note</h2><p>This project was as much about nostalgia as it was about production techniques. Born and raised in <strong>Paris in the &#39;80s</strong>, I grew up surrounded by the cultural influences that would eventually shape <strong>French Touch</strong>. Now, having lived in California for the past seven years, reconstructing this track felt like building a <em>sonic bridge</em> between my past and present.</p><p>This recreation isn&#39;t perfect—nor was it meant to be. It&#39;s a <em>personal interpretation</em> filtered through my musical sensibilities and the tools available to me. What mattered more than technical precision was <em>capturing the emotional essence</em> that made the original so affecting.</p><p>A huge part of the joy came from working in <strong>Ableton Live 12</strong>, which now feels like an extension of how I think:</p><ul><li>The <strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong> and editing feel almost like using a great text editor—<strong>Sublime Text</strong> for music.</li><li><strong>Audio editing</strong> has improved dramatically. Where <a href="https://www.avid.com/pro-tools?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Pro Tools</strong></a> was once the undisputed champion, it now feels more like <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>BBEdit</strong></a>. Still powerful, but clunky. <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Logic</strong></a>, meanwhile, still lags behind.</li><li>The <strong>stock effects</strong> and instruments are incredibly well-designed. The built-in <strong>Sampler</strong> and <strong>Wavetable</strong> synths are top-notch. For certain sounds, sure, I still reach for plugins (especially analog emulations like <strong>Arturia’s</strong>), but the native tools are more than enough to create something great.</li><li>Every module shares a <strong>consistent user interface</strong>, which really helps you stay in the flow.</li><li><strong>It’s <em>fast</em>.</strong> Projects load quickly, startup is near-instant, and it handles plugins like a champ. (Seriously, how does Logic still take so long?)</li><li>Even under load, <strong>Live</strong> stays snappy. It never gets in the way of the creative process.</li><li>The <strong>Drum Rack</strong> is beautifully intuitive—a joy to use and <em>miles ahead</em> of <strong>Logic’s</strong> equivalent.</li></ul><p>After bouncing the session, I moved to <a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/tr6/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>T-Racks</strong></a> for mastering, putting the final polish on a project that was as educational as it was enjoyable.</p><p>This is a personal interpretation, not a definitive one. But I <em>hope you enjoyed reading it</em>, and maybe even listening along ❤️</p><p>Here&#39;s my <a href="https://marca.fyi/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">personal page</a> and my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marcatatem/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Instagram account</a>.</p>
