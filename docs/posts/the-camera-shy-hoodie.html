<h2><strong><em>The Camera-Shy Hoodie</em></strong></h2><p>The Camera-Shy Hoodie is a DIY adversarial garment designed to give the user the option to anonymize themselves within the recording of a night vision security camera.</p><p>The hoodie embeds a number of high-power IR LEDs, utilizing the same wavelength of infrared light commonly used by security cameras as flood lights for night vision. By pointing the LEDs back at the camera and setting them to a tuned strobe, the security camera’s capture becomes overexposed, significantly losing definition of the scene. The LED strobe, tuned to interfere with these cameras auto-exposure, causes a strong loss of definition where the light is strongest. In this layout, where the LEDs are arrayed around the upper chest, shoulders, and upper back of the wearer, that head of the wearer is then significantly obfuscated.</p><p>As the hoodie uses IR light, it’s effects are imperceptible<strong> </strong>by human eyes when activated, only effecting IR sensitive equipment.</p><p>A full package to make your own including a bill of materials, design files, reference photos, and a detailed assembly guide can be found here - <a href="https://samuelselleck.com/s/CameraShyHoodie_Full_v1-0.zip"><strong>[ZIP, 11.7MB]</strong></a></p><p>A standalone assembly guide can be found here - <a href="https://samuelselleck.com/s/CameraShyHoodie_Instructions.pdf"><strong>[PDF, 625KB]</strong></a></p><p>High resolution images and more media can be found here - <a href="https://samuelselleck.com/the-camerashy-hoodie-gallery"><strong>[High-Res Gallery]</strong></a>.</p>
