    <h1>The Decline of Usability (2020)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p><b>In which we delve into the world of user interface design.</b></p>

<p><i>Spring 2020</i></p>

<h2>Our premise</h2>

<p>
There was a time (roughly between 1994 and 2012) when a reasonably computer-literate user could sit down in front of almost any operating system and quickly get to grips with the GUI, no matter what their home base was. Windows, MacOS, CDE, OpenStep, OS/2 and even outliers like Amiga, Atari and BeOS all had more in common than what set them apart. All windows had a title bar for dragging, easy identification and displaying current input focus. Clearly labeled drop-down menus following a set standard (File, Edit, View, Help etc.) made it easy for a newcomer to an application to browse program features and learn keyboard shortcuts. Buttons, input fields and other widget elements were clearly identifiable through various visual cues, such as 3D bevels.
</p>

<p>
A few rogue applications didn&#39;t play by the rules, but the vast majority of software did, at least in the fundamental places that really mattered.
</p>

<p>
Today, it seems we&#39;re on another track completely. Despite being endlessly fawned over by an army of professionals, Usability, or as it used to be called, &#34;User Friendliness&#34;, is steadily declining. During the last ten years or so, adhering to basic standard concepts seems to have fallen out of fashion. On comparatively new platforms, I.E. smartphones, it&#39;s inevitable: the input mechanisms and interactions with the display are so different from desktop computers that new paradigms are warranted.
</p>

<p>
Worryingly, these paradigms have begun spreading to the desktop, where keyboards for fast typing and pixel-precision mice  effectively render them pointless. Coupled with the flat design trend, UI elements are increasingly growing both bigger and yet somehow harder to locate and tell apart from non-interactive decorations and content.
</p>

<p>
Overall, designers of desktop applications seem to have abandoned the fact that a desktop computer is capable of displaying several applications and windows at the same time and that many users are accustomed to this. Instead, we&#39;re increasingly treated to small-screen, single-app paradigms copied from smartphones. That&#39;s a turn for the worse in its own right, but perhaps more troubling and annoying is the recurring sidestepping from the tried and true UI design that is so ingrained in many users it&#39;s practically muscle memory by now.
