  What is the smallest CSS we can write to produce the Fizz Buzz
  sequence?  One could of course do this with no CSS at all, simply by
  placing the entire sequence as plain text in the HTML body.  So to
  make the problem precise and keep it interesting, we require that
  every number and word that appears in the output must come directly
  from the CSS.  Placing any part of the output numbers or words
  outside the stylesheet or using JavaScript is not allowed.  With
  this constraint, I think it can be done in four lines of CSS as
  shown below:
</p>
<pre><code>li { counter-increment: n }
li:not(:nth-child(5n))::before { content: counter(n) }
li:nth-child(3n)::before { content: &#34;Fizz&#34; }
li:nth-child(5n)::after { content: &#34;Buzz&#34; }</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is a complete working example:

  I am neither a web developer nor a code-golfer.  Seasoned
  code-golfers looking for a challenge can probably shrink this
  solution further.  However, such wizards are also likely to scoff at
  any mention of counting lines of code, since CSS can be collapsed
  into a single line.  The number of characters is probably more
  meaningful.  The code can also be minified slightly by removing all
  whitespace:
</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -sS https://susam.net/css-fizz-buzz.html | sed -n &#39;/counter/,/after/p&#39; | tr -d &#39;[:space:]&#39;
li{counter-increment:n}li:not(:nth-child(5n))::before{content:counter(n)}li:nth-child(3n)::before{content:&#34;Fizz&#34;}li:nth-child(5n)::after{content:&#34;Buzz&#34;}</code></pre>
<p>
  This minified version is composed of 152 characters:
</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -sS https://susam.net/css-fizz-buzz.html | sed -n &#39;/counter/,/after/p&#39; | tr -d &#39;[:space:]&#39; | wc -c
152</code></pre>

  If you manage to create a shorter solution, please do leave a
  comment.
