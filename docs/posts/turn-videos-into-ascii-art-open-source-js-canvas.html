            <h2 id="aboutText">About</h2>

            <p>Turn videos into ASCII pixel art! Use your webcam feed or upload a video, then use the controls to adjust the colors, resolution, text style, etc...</p>
            <p>You can create a video export to save and/or share your animation afterwards.</p>
            <p>This tool is completely free, open source (MIT license), without any paywalls or premium options. You are welcome to use it for personal or commercial purposes.</p>
            <p>If you found this tool useful, feel free to buy me a coffee. This would be much appreciated during late-night coding sessions!</p>

            <p>If the video export feature does not work for you, please try a free screen-recording tool such as OBS Studio.</p>

            <p>This project is coded using Javascript, HTML canvas, and CSS (see github repo linked below). Video creation and encoding is done using mp4 muxer.</p>
            <p>Enormous thanks and credits to <a href="https://medium.com/@sasha.kub95/webcam-stream-to-ascii-art-with-javascript-2a2f9a39befb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aleksandr Kubarskii</a>, whose code served as the foundation for this project.</p>
            <p>I do not have access to any of the videos that you upload here, as all processing is done &#34;client-side&#34; (i.e., <b>no videos or images are saved/stored by me â€” they stay on your computer only</b>).</p>
            <p>Feel free to reach out to discuss, ask questions, or to share your creations! The animations can be easily uploaded to instagram or otherwise -- you can tag me <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stereo.drift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@stereo.drift</a> :)</p>
