    <h1>The Art of Naming</h1>

<p>“Good software developers give their variables good names.”</p>



<p>A manager told me this many years ago. I assumed this showed attention to detail. For, me this statement went much deeper.</p>



<p>Good names build a bridge between the abstract world of symbols and the human world of meaning.</p>



<h2>Cover Songs</h2>



<p>I am obsessed with song covers. Creating a good cover of a song is like giving a variable a good name. It reflects an essential meaning of the song.</p>



<p>Jimi Hendrix’s version of “All Along the Watchtower” sounds how the words mean in a way the Dylan version does not.</p>



<h2>Speech Acts</h2>



<p>Language is not only a medium of communication, but it also acts. In our culture, specific phrases change the world. When a judge says, “I now pronounce you wife and wife,” a marriage is created- a new legal entity.</p>



<p>When we write software, we create a language that acts.</p>



<h2>Genealogy</h2>



<p>A name may start as a label for a part, like “I got new wheels” instead of “I got a new car.” But, over time, this part may grow symbolic power. One day, the word “wheel” may replace the word “car.”</p>



<p>Language can change the way it acts. It evolves.</p>



<h2>A New Name</h2>



<p>This week I created a new microservice at work. Creating a microservice is momentous, and I spent time discussing the name.</p>



<p>Should we use a similar name as the service this was replacing? Should we use the word security or instrument?</p>



<p>The name and the service co-created each other. When we created this name, we created boundaries.</p>



<h2>Did our ancestors name things?</h2>



<p>Our ancestors named their children and their livestock, but that was about it. We live in a time of rapid innovation and name things all the time: new products, new variables, new websites, new microservices.</p>



<p>Names come from nothing. An object has a name because someone gives a name to something. It is a gift.</p>



<h2>Identity, Pseudonymity, and the Metaverse</h2>



<p>Names refer to groups, individuals, containers, and bits and pieces of all of these. Digital technology allows everything to be combined and mixed.</p>



<p>Naming remains one of our most primal psychotechnologies of sensemaking. Good names make sense.</p>
