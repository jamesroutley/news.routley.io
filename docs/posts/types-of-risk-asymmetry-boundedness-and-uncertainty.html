    <h1>Types of Risk: Asymmetry, Boundedness, and Uncertainty</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>When people think of </span><em>risk</em><span> as a concept, many people think of losing money (which, if you were in the stock market last year, yeah, ouch!). But going to zero is not the worst possible outcome from a risk perspective. </span></p><p><span>No, the worst possible outcome is </span><em>unlimited</em><span> losses. Unlimited losses stem from </span><em>unbounded downside risk, insufficiently mitigated</em><span>—the nemesis of every risk manager. </span></p><p><strong>How about some examples?</strong></p><p><span>Sure. Back in 2012, an employee at trading firm Knight Capital Group </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2013/34-70694.pdf" rel="">made an error while rolling out new code for a trade routing system</a><span>, which resulted in Knight losing more than $400 million on its automated trades in about 45 minutes. The company </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Capital_Group" rel="">was ultimately acquired by Getco LLC</a><span>. Its existence as an independent firm ended. </span></p><p><span>More generally, a canonical example of unbounded downside risk coupled with bounded upside potential (the worst possible combination) is shorting a stock without hedging the trade. When you short a stock, you are betting that the stock price will decrease. And if the stock price does decrease, you make money. But your upside is limited: if you short 100 shares of a $10 stock and it goes to zero, your maximum possible gain is $1000 (100 * $10). Even worse, if the stock price </span><em>increases</em><span> instead of decreasing, you lose money, and stock prices do not have an upper bound. If you short a stock and it goes up, it can keep going up pretty much indefinitely, and </span><a href="https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/ins-and-outs-short-selling" rel="">you can keep losing money pretty much indefinitely</a><span> (until you </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortcovering.asp" rel="">cover</a><span>). Imagine shorting Amazon back in 2001 at 30 cents per share (split-adjusted)—its share price has increased more than 300x since then. </span></p><p><span>Another example: one reason why people are so worried about future AI is that the downside risk is potentially unbounded </span><em>and</em><span> not sufficiently hedged yet</span></p><p><span>. If AI someday evolves to become artificial general intelligence (AGI) and is not aligned with human interests, it theoretically could eliminate humans. And there is no defined upper bound on possible damage. A hostile AI theoretically could expand into space and eventually reach other galaxies. Vastly improved controls might eventually serve as a hedge against AI risk, but it’s not clear whether downside risks can be sufficiently mitigated to make them bounded. It’s not as easy as hedging a short trade with a counterbalancing long position. </span></p><p><strong>So, potentially unbounded losses are bad. Let’s talk symmetry and asymmetry. </strong></p><p><span>Many risks are asymmetric, and risk scenarios can be asymmetric in </span><em>either </em><span>direction. I’m using the term “asymmetric” to mean either the downside outcome is more likely than the upside outcome (you’re more likely to lose than win), or the upside outcome is more likely than the downside outcome (you’re more likely to win than lose).</span></p><p><span> The </span><em>degree </em><span>of asymmetry can vary widely on a spectrum, with many possible values, and is a major and complex determinant of whether a risk is worth taking or not.</span></p><p><span>Considering asymmetry as well as the magnitude of downside risk or upside potential, we can identify several categories of risk scenarios</span></p><p><span>: </span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Asymmetric toward an unbounded downside with a bounded upside</strong><span> </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Asymmetric toward a bounded downside with a bounded upside</strong><span> </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Asymmetric toward a bounded downside with an unbounded upside</strong><span> </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Asymmetric toward a bounded upside</strong><span> </span><strong>with a bounded downside </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asymmetric toward a bounded upside</strong><span> </span><strong>with an unbounded downside </strong></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Asymmetric toward an unbounded upside with a bounded downside</span><br/></strong><em>In plain English:</em><span> </span><em>if you’re comfortable with the limited downside, are certain it’s really limited, and your circumstances permit, you should take these risks.</em><span> </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Symmetric with bounded downside </strong><em><strong>and</strong></em><strong> bounded upside</strong><span> </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Uncertain symmetry with unbounded downside </strong><em><strong>and </strong></em><strong>unbounded upside</strong><span> </span></p><span>. But the potential downside is not just the end of humans but the end of many worlds. </span><em>And the directionality of the risk is uncertain</em><span> </span><em>right now</em><span>. Your position on AGI will depend on whether you believe the risk is asymmetric toward the downside (AGI is more likely to be misaligned when it comes into being) or asymmetric toward the upside (humans are likely to figure out alignment, and human-aligned AGI will shepherd us into a new and wonderful era). </span></li></ul><p><strong>Takeaways: thinking through the tradeoffs</strong></p><p><span>To sum up, your risk decisions will depend on the degree of asymmetry you perceive or calculate, the directionality of that asymmetry (favoring the upside or downside), the boundedness of both upside and downside, </span><em>and</em><span> your unique situation, comfort level, and margin for error. </span></p><p>One way to approach this is to ask: what’s the worst thing that could go wrong if I take this action, and what’s the worst thing that could go wrong if I do not take this action? Are those worst-case outcomes unbounded or bounded risks? </p><p>If you’re facing a potentially unbounded downside risk, you might consider avoiding that path and looking for a different way to accomplish your goals. If you’re facing an asymmetric risk favoring the downside—even if that risk is bounded—and the upside is limited, you also might choose to look for other options. </p><p><span>On the other hand, if potential for gain is higher than the risk of loss, you may choose to take a risk since upside is favored (again, taking into account your own situation, context, comfort level, and margin for error). And if the gain is potentially </span><em>unbounded</em><span>, and the maximum potential loss is low and bounded, it may be a golden opportunity (or, it may not be! You may have overlooked vipers at the bottom of the pit, or something could happen two years from now to change the equation. Do your due diligence! There are no guarantees in risk).</span></p><p><span>Lastly, if potential gain is unbounded, and potential loss is also unbounded, and there is no consensus on whether the downside or upside is more likely (the direction of asymmetry is </span><em>uncertain</em><span>), you are on dangerous ground and should step carefully until the lay of the land becomes clearer. Respect uncertainty, measure what you can, and exercise proactive caution to avoid getting caught off-guard. This is risk management.</span></p><div data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/types-of-risk-symmetry-asymmetry?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;}"><p>If you like this post, please share it with a friend by forwarding this email, post it on LinkedIn or Hacker News, whatever feels right!</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/types-of-risk-symmetry-asymmetry?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;}"><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/types-of-risk-symmetry-asymmetry?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
