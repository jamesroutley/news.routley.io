<p>Comcast has reluctantly agreed to discontinue its &#34;Xfinity 10G Network&#34; brand name after losing an appeal of a ruling that found the marketing term was misleading. It will keep using the term 10G in other ways, however.</p>
<p>Verizon and T-Mobile both challenged Comcast&#39;s advertising of 10G, a term used by cable companies since it was unveiled in January 2019 by industry lobby group NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association. We <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/envious-of-5g-hype-cable-cos-unveil-potentially-confusing-10g-trademark/">wrote in 2019</a> that the cable industry&#39;s 10G marketing was likely to confuse consumers and seemed to be a way of countering 5G hype generated by wireless companies.</p>
<p>10G doesn&#39;t refer to the 10th generation of a technology. It is a reference to potential 10Gbps broadband connections, which would be much faster than the actual speeds on standard cable networks today.</p>
<p>The challenges lodged against Comcast marketing were filed with the advertising industry&#39;s self-regulatory system run by BBB National Programs. BBB&#39;s National Advertising Division (NAD) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/comcast-should-stop-advertising-slower-speeds-as-10g-industry-group-says/">ruled against Comcast</a> in October 2023, but Comcast appealed to the National Advertising Review Board (NARB).</p>
<p>The NARB <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/comcast-10g-xfinity">announced its ruling</a> today, agreeing with the NAD that &#34;Comcast should discontinue use of the term 10G, both when used in the name of the service itself (&#39;Xfinity 10G Network&#39;) as well as when used to describe the Xfinity network. The use of 10G in a manner that is not false or misleading and is consistent with the panel decision is not precluded by the panel recommendations.&#34;</p>
<h2>“Comcast will discontinue brand name”</h2>
<p>Comcast agreed to make the change in an advertiser&#39;s statement that it provided to the NARB. &#34;Although Comcast strongly disagrees with NARB&#39;s analysis and approach, Comcast will discontinue use of the brand name &#39;Xfinity 10G Network&#39; and will not use the term &#39;10G&#39; in a manner that misleadingly describes the Xfinity network itself,&#34; Comcast said.</p>
<p>Comcast said it disagrees with &#34;the recommendation to discontinue the brand name&#34; because the company &#34;makes available 10Gbps of Internet speed to 98 percent of its subscribers upon request.&#34; But those 10Gbps speeds aren&#39;t available in Comcast&#39;s typical service plans and require a fiber-to-the-home connection instead of a standard cable installation.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The Comcast &#34;Gigabit Pro&#34; fiber connection that provides 10Gbps speeds costs $299.95 a month plus a $19.95 modem lease fee. It also requires a $500 installation charge and a $500 activation charge.</p>
<p>Comcast said it may still use 10G in ways that are less likely to confuse consumers. &#34;Consistent with the panel&#39;s recommendation... Comcast reserves the right to use the term &#39;10G&#39; or &#39;Xfinity 10G&#39; in a manner that does not misleadingly describe the Xfinity network itself,&#34; the company said.</p>
<p>When contacted by Ars, a Comcast spokesperson said, &#34;We disagree with the decision but are pleased that we have confirmed our continued use of 10G in advertising.&#34;</p>
<h2>Comcast claims “not supported”</h2>
<p>The NARB said the &#34;recent availability of 10G speeds through [the Gigabit Pro] service tier does not support the superior speed claim (or a 10Gbps claim) for the Xfinity network as a whole.&#34; As the NARB noted, there is an &#34;absence&#34; of data showing how many Comcast customers actually use that service.</p>
<p>The NARB also said that 10G is misleading because of the implied comparison to 5G wireless networks. &#34;The NARB panel concluded that 10G expressly communicates at a minimum that users of the Xfinity network will experience significantly faster speeds than are available on 5G networks,&#34; the announcement of the ruling said. &#34;This express claim is not supported because the record does not contain any data comparing speeds experienced by Xfinity network users with speeds experienced by subscribers to 5G networks.&#34;</p>
<p>As the NAD has <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/comcast-10g">previously stated</a>, 10G is more of an &#34;aspirational&#34; term rather than something that&#39;s offered over today&#39;s cable networks. Over the past five years, the NCTA has been using the term 10G to describe just about any improvement to cable networks, regardless of the actual speeds.</p>
<p>The NCTA coincidentally issued a <a href="https://www.ncta.com/whats-new/10g-five-years-on-the-future-is-even-closer">press release</a> yesterday hailing the fifth anniversary of its first 10G announcement. &#34;Five years on, the future is even closer... Here in 2024, the promise of 10G is becoming more and more of a reality,&#34; the NCTA said.</p>
<p>The announcement listed some examples of multi-gigabit (but not 10-gigabit) cable speeds, some of which were only achieved in lab testing or demos. NCTA claimed that &#34;10G can change lives&#34; and that the &#34;10G platform will facilitate the next great technological advancements in the coming decades, ensuring fast, reliable, and safe networks continue to power the American economy.&#34;</p>
<p>For all of you cable broadband users, just remember to ignore &#34;10G&#34; in cable-company marketing and check the actual speeds you&#39;re paying for.</p>
