                        <p><SPAN face="Verdana"><i>The media were stress tested according to a procedure designed by Millenniata at a facility of the United States Department of Defense. The testing found that M-Disc DVDs are more durable than conventional DVDs. &#34;The discs were subject to the following test conditions in the environmental chamber: 85°C, 85% relative humidity (conditions specified in ECMA-379) and full spectrum light&#34;. However according to the French National Laboratory of Metrology and Testing at 90°C and 85% humidity the DVD+R with inorganic recording layer such as M-DISC show no longer lifetimes than conventional DVD±R.</i></SPAN></p>
                        <p><SPAN face="Verdana"><i>Conventional DVD-R and BD-R LTH (Low To High) use recording layers of organic dye and separate reflective layers. Standard (HTL) BD-R and BD-R/DL (except LTH BD-R) typically use inorganic data layers, but continue using a reflective layer. M-DISC BD-R has no reflective layer. M-DISC uses a single inorganic recording layer, which is substantially inert to oxygen, but requires a higher-powered laser. M-DISC DVD does not require the reflective layer. Thus, both the M-DISC and inorganic BD-R physically alter the recording layer, burning a permanent hole in the material. Besides physical damage, failure of the reflective layer, followed closely by degradation of the data layer, are the primary failure modes of all optically recordable disks.</i></SPAN></p>
                        <p><SPAN face="Verdana"><i>Recorded discs are readable in conventional drives. Available recording capacities are similar to other optical media from 4.7GB DVD-R to 25GB, 50GB BD-R and 100GB BD-XL. In first DVD and Blu-ray M-Discs there was difficulty distinguishing the writable side of the disc, so they added color to distinguish the sides and make it look like the coloring on standard DVD or Blu-ray media.</i></SPAN></p>
                        <p><SPAN face="Verdana"><i>LG Electronics, ASUS and Lite-On produce drives that can record M-DISC media. Ritek produces M-DISC Blu-ray disc media, sold under the Imation, Ritek and M-DISC brands. Verbatim produces co-branded discs, marketed as the &#34;Verbatim M-Disc&#34;.</i><br/>

                        <hr/>
                        <p><SPAN face="Verdana">So, I thought I would buy a new Blueray writer which can also burn M-Discs. All of the modern LG burners can now write M discs, I learn. I bought this one.</SPAN><SPAN face="Verdana"></SPAN></p>
