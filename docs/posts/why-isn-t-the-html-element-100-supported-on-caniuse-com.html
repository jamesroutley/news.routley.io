					<h2>Why Isn&#39;t the &lt;html&gt; Element 100% Supported on CanIUse.com?</h2>
					<h3>February 02, 2024</h3>
					<p>I saw a <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@Ronflaix/111862153259345050">Mastodon post</a> that made me laugh this morning. It seemed sort of crazy that the <code>html</code> element <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_html">wouldn’t have 100% support</a> on CanIUse.com. Heck, I’ve been using it since 1994 and it worked just fine back then! This led me down a bit of a rabbit hole.</p>

<p>A bit of background, first. <a href="https://caniuse.com">Can I Use…</a> is a site that helps web developers track the adoption rate of web technologies. It estimates browser usage, measures feature compatibility, and spits out a number that tries to reflect how available a feature is. It’s a site I’ve been using almost since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100430032738/http://caniuse.com/">it launched in 2010</a> and I’ve always found it really useful.</p>

<p>So why is it currently saying the <code>html</code> element only has 97.34% support? That’s less than the current support percentage for the <a href="https://caniuse.com/audio"><code>audio</code> element</a>! It also looks like the same is true for the <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_a"><code>a</code></a> and <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_p"><code>p</code></a> elements with exactly the same 97.34% support number.</p>

<p>One thing I learned when looking into this is that a lot of the data on the site actually comes from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. MDN is another resource I use and trust, so this seems reasonable to me. It also often has stats about feature uptake, so it makes sense for CanIUse.com to piggyback on that.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html">MDN page for the <code>html</code> element</a>, it has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html#browser_compatibility">browser compatibility section</a>. In that are two rows with a lot of red Xs. The first is for the optional <code>manifest</code> attribute on the <code>html</code> element. This is deprecated and was never standardized. The second is the related “<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/">secure context required</a>”, which is an <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/types/#x2-3-editor-s-draft">Editor’s Draft</a> — that is, not something currently on the standardization track. I don’t know how this was previously related to the <code>html</code> element, but that use was also <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_html_manifest_secure_context_required">never standardized and is deprecated</a>.</p>

<p>So, there are two features listed here that almost all browsers <em>correctly</em> do not support. But still, it doesn’t look like this is the reason for the missing 2.66%. There are some browsers that are listed as “Support Unknown”. Adding up all the current usage for these browsers comes to 1.27%. There’s also an entry for Android Browser versions 2.1–4.3 which is listed as not supporting the <code>html</code> element — which I find highly dubious — but it’s listed as having a usage share of 0%. I suppose there might be some rounding errors here that would bump the 1.27% to 2.66%? But I still find this very unclear. Also, I feel very confident that those older browsers supported the <code>html</code> element!</p>

<p>So yeah, I don’t have a great answer for this. If you do, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gavinanderegg">please let me know</a>! I’ve always taken the numbers from CanIUse.com with a few grains of salt, but I’ll be adding a few more going forward. I still think it’s a great resource.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://cliff.social/@rezonant">rezonant</a> on Mastodon poked me to let me know that he posted a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39236148">comment on Hacker News</a> that has a possible explanation. The short version: if you switch to “% of all tracked” in the top right beside “usage”, and then add up the “support unknown” browser number, you get 99.98%. It’s a lot easier to see how rounding errors could make this the correct number. Still, I think the way older browsers are handled here is confusing. It doesn’t affect the overall number too much, but in the case of base level elements like <code>html</code>, it seems odd.</p>
