    <h1>Morse, an open-source interactive tool for inspecting Clojure</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>One of the prime value propositions in using a Lisp language is that you should be able to interact with your live program. The typical access mechanism for Clojure programs is the REPL, but its print-oriented streaming nature limits interactive and graphical data exploration.</p>
<p>Morse, like REBL before it, is a library that provides a graphical browser for Clojure data that allows active traversal into and back out of nested structures. REBL was intended to sit in the middle of your editor⇔process REPL streams and automatically render and cache all REPL results. This made it difficult to integrate with dev environments that used REPLS without raw streaming capabilities. In Morse the emphasis is now on inspecting on demand via the <code>inspect</code> API, and REPL interception is strictly optional. This should make Morse easy to integrate with all dev setups.</p>
<p>It’s not always feasible to execute a graphical browser process inside of the program process, e.g. when the inspected program is running remotely. Morse can be configured to connect to and inspect a remote program, a facility built on the new Replicant libraries. Morse uses Replicant to efficiently and incrementally traverse remote data, extending its power to a variety of new use cases.</p>
