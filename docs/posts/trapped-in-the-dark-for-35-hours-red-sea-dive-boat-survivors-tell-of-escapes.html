Up to 11 people died or are still missing, including two Britons, Jenny Cawson and Tarig Sinada from Devon.<!-- --></p><p>At the time, Egyptian authorities attributed the disaster to a huge wave of up to 4m (13ft), but the BBC has spoken to 11 survivors of the Sea Story who have cast doubt on the claim. That has been supported by a leading oceanographer, who told us weather data from the time suggests a wave could not have been responsible, and that a combination of crew error and failings in the boat were the likely cause.<!-- --></p><p>As well as describing the terror of being trapped in a rapidly sinking boat, the survivors accuse the company which ran it, Dive Pro Liveaboard, of several safety failings. They also say the Egyptian authorities were slow to react, something which may have cost lives. We have put questions to Dive Pro Liveaboard - based in Hurghada - and the Egyptian government, but not received any reply.<!-- --></p><p>This, for the first time, is the inside story of how the Sea Story sank, as told by those who made it out alive.<!-- --></p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://kracekumar.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8889/live/ed128610-d1d8-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8889/live/ed128610-d1d8-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8889/live/ed128610-d1d8-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8889/live/ed128610-d1d8-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8889/live/ed128610-d1d8-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8889/live/ed128610-d1d8-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8889/live/ed128610-d1d8-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8889/live/ed128610-d1d8-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.png.webp" alt="A map showing the approximate location of the Sea Story&#39;s capsize and passengers&#39; rescue.

They were on a six-day trip, with their first destination being Sataya Reef, a popular diving spot.<!-- --></p><p>Like many of those on board, Lucianna&#39;s first impressions of the Sea Story were positive. &#34;It looked like a really nice boat, very big, very clean,&#34; she says, speaking from her home in Belgium.<!-- --></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Watch: Dr Sarah Martin took a look around the Sea Story before it left Port Ghaleb<!-- --></figcaption></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The company had transferred over Lucianna and others at the last minute from another boat, which had hundreds of good online reviews.

A passenger filmed as the crew battled to bring it back on board - the oceanographer the BBC spoke to says the video shows conditions which were not unusual and consistent with 1.5m (5ft) waves.<!-- --></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Watch: Sea conditions that night can be seen in this video of the Sea Story crew retrieving a small inflatable <!-- --></figcaption></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Looking out at the waves, the weather wasn&#39;t terrible,&#34; says Sarah Martin, an NHS doctor from Lancaster who was on the trip.

All the people we spoke to recall a safety briefing mentioning that the life rafts had food and water in them - but they did not, the BBC were told.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;We found a torch, but again it didn&#39;t have any batteries. We didn&#39;t have any water or any food,&#34; Sarah says. &#34;There were flares, but they had already been used.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>Sarah also says of the three blankets on board the raft, one had been taken by the captain for himself, leaving one for the rest of the crew and another for the guests. &#34;We ripped it up and huddled together,&#34; says Sarah.<!-- --></p><p>The rafts were met by rescue vessels at about 11:00 on the morning of 25 November, about eight hours after the capsizing. Both they, and the boat, had drifted eastwards.<!-- --></p><p>Back on board the Sea Story, Lucianna heard the rescue helicopter - but her ordeal was far from over.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;At this time we were very happy, but we had to wait 27 hours more,&#34; she says.<!-- --></p><p>Despite the boat having been located, the rescue effort was slow to reach them. &#34;We had no communication with the outside, nothing. No-one tried to see if there was someone alive in there,&#34; Lucianna says.<!-- --></p><p>She tells me there were moments when darkness and despair overtook her. &#34;I was so ready to die. We didn&#39;t think that someone would come.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>After several hours trapped in the air pocket, the dive guide, Youssef, wanted to try to swim through the boat, but Lucianna and Christophe persuaded him not to. &#34;Stay with us because they are going to come to get our bodies, so they will find us,&#34; Lucianna recalls telling him.<!-- --></p><p>Eventually, after nearly a day and a half stuck in the hull of the Sea Story, a light appeared in the darkness.<!-- --></p><p>A local Egyptian diving instructor, Khattab al-Faramawi, who was Youssef&#39;s uncle, had braved the wreck, diving through the submerged corridors looking for people. He took Youssef out first, then, after another hour&#39;s delay because of issues with the breathing apparatus, returned to lead Lucianna and her partner to safety. &#34;I hugged him so hard,&#34; says Lucianna. &#34;I was very, very happy.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>In total, five people from the Sea Story were rescued by divers, including a Swiss man and a Finnish man who had survived in another air pocket inside their cabin on the lower deck. Four bodies were recovered.<!-- --></p><p>But Lucianna is critical of the fact the Egyptian navy had to rely on volunteers. &#34;We waited 35 hours. I don&#39;t understand how there are no divers on the Egyptian military boats.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>Lucianna, Christophe and Youssef were taken on board a waiting naval vessel, before returning to shore. They were the last to be rescued. At least 11 people either died or are missing, presumed dead.<!-- --></p><p>Among them are Jenny Cawson and Tarig Sinada, a couple from Devon who were staying on the main deck, on the side of the boat that hit the water. Their bodies have never been found.<!-- --></p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://kracekumar.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ca06/live/a49438f0-d19e-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ca06/live/a49438f0-d19e-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca06/live/a49438f0-d19e-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ca06/live/a49438f0-d19e-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ca06/live/a49438f0-d19e-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ca06/live/a49438f0-d19e-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ca06/live/a49438f0-d19e-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca06/live/a49438f0-d19e-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp" alt="Tarig with his arm around Tarig with the sea in the background."/></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Jenny and Tarig have not been found<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s real,&#34; says Andy Williamson, a friend of the couple. &#34;We keep expecting them to walk through the door.&#34; A month and a half after the sinking, hopes of that happening have all but vanished.<!-- --></p><p>The couple were experienced divers who always carefully researched the safety record of boats before their trips.
