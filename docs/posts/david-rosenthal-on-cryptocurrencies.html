<p>The premise:</p>
<p>-&gt; People create culture.</p>
<p>-&gt; Culture shapes values.</p>
<p>-&gt; Values inform strategy.</p>
<p>-&gt; Technology is Strategy actualised.</p>

<p>The implication:</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if the “Best case” happened most of the time?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t you like to be the sort of leader who makes it happen? A person of
whom people genuinely say “<em>I did some of the best work of my life because of
their leadership.</em>”? I’ve had one or two of those in my life so far. Enough to
<em>believe</em>.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, though.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It requires a lot of self-work, but you can’t go it alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no roads, but there are landmarks, GPSes, and gyroscopes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no formulas, but there are stories, clues, and feedback loops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are few such leaders, but there are many followers, and leadership is
teachable. Anyone going on this quest will discover the surprising array of
people who want to rally around to help them succeed. I know I would!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many places to look. Here’s just one such bag full of some pretty
good clues.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Westrum’s typology of organizational culture</em> (table below), as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture">presented here</a>
in context of Google’s DORA research, but which is generally applicable to any
team within any organisation, as well as to any org of any size in any industry.</p>

accompaniment during the day’s perambulations:</p>
