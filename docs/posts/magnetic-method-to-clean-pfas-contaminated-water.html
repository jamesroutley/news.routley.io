    <h1>Magnetic method to clean PFAS contaminated water</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span><span>Researchers at The University of Queensland have pioneered a simple, fast and effective technique to remove PFAS chemicals from water.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Using a magnet and a reusable absorption aid that they developed, polymer chemist </span><a href="https://aibn.uq.edu.au/profile/3985/cheng-zhang"><span>Dr Cheng Zhang</span></a><span> and PhD candidate </span><a href="https://aibn.uq.edu.au/profile/5847/xiao-tan"><span>Xiao Tan</span></a><span> at the</span><a href="https://aibn.uq.edu.au/article/2022/10/minjun-kim-porous-carbon-better-batteries-and-working-small-save-planet"><span> Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology</span></a><span> have cleared 95 per cent of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from a small amount of contaminated water in under a minute.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“Removing PFAS chemicals from contaminated waters is urgently needed to safeguard public and environmental health,” Dr Zhang said.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“But existing methods require machinery like pumps, take a lot of time and need their own power source.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“Our method shows it is possible to remove more of these chemicals in a way that is faster, cheaper, cleaner, and very simple.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“Because our process does not need electricity, it can be used in remote and off-grid communities.”  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>PFAS substances are synthetic compounds used in industry and consumer products since the 1950s, but they persist in the environment potentially leading to human health problems.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The PFAS removal technique developed by Dr Zhang and Mr Tan involves treating contaminated water with a new solution, called a magnetic fluorinated polymer sorbent.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“This solution that we developed coats the PFAS particles and then we can use a magnet to attract, isolate and remove them,” Dr Zhang said. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“The solution itself can be reused up to 10 times.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“Our team will now scale up the testing and we hope to have a commercially available product ready in the next three years.” </span></span></span></span></p>
