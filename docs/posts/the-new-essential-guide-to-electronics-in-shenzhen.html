				<p>Some might remember a book I released in 2016, “The Essential Guide to Electronics in Shenzhen”. A lot has changed in the world since then, and Shenzhen is no exception.</p>
<p>There’s a new maintainer of the guide, <a href="https://twitter.com/RealSexyCyborg">Naomi Wu (@realsexycyborg)</a>, and she is crowdfunding an updated, new version with a snazzy red cover, called <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/machinery-enchantress/the-new-essential-guide-to-electronics-in-shenzhen">“The New Essential Guide to Electronics in Shenzhen”</a>. While the technical Chinese terms haven’t changed much, a lot has changed in the culture and ways to do business; her new text gives pointers on how to engage on Wechat, digital etiquette in China, updated maps, and much more.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed The Guide in the past, or hope to visit the electronics markets in Shenzhen in the future, you can <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/machinery-enchantress/the-new-essential-guide-to-electronics-in-shenzhen">reserve your copy today</a>.</p>
