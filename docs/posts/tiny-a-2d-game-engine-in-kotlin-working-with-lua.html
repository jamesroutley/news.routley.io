    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Introducing the Tiny CLI, a powerful command-line interface that allows you to easily create, run, develop, and export games using the Tiny 2D game engine. With the Tiny CLI, you can quickly and easily create a new game project, add assets, and start developing your game in no time.</p>
<p>To get started, simply install the Tiny CLI on your system and create a new project using the <code>tiny-cli create</code> command. This will generate a new project directory with all the necessary files and folder structure to start building your game. You can then add assets to your game using the <code>tiny-cli add</code> command, which allows you to import images, audio files, and other resources into your project.</p>
<p>The Tiny CLI also includes a powerful development server that allows you to preview your game in real-time as you develop it. Simply run the tiny command and start to update your game.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to share your game with the world, the Tiny CLI makes it easy to export your game for web browsers. You can use the <code>tiny-cli export</code> command to generate a distributable version of your game that can be published on the web. You can also try the <code>export</code> result by using the command <code>tiny-cli serve</code>.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a seasoned game developer or just getting started, the Tiny CLI is a powerful tool that can help you create, run, develop, and export amazing 2D games with the Tiny engine. With its intuitive command-line interface and powerful features, the Tiny CLI is the ultimate tool for building your next great game.</p>

<code>game.zip</code>: The path to the exported game zip file.</p>
<div>
<h5 id="_options">Options</h5>
<p><code>--port [port number]</code>: Allows you to specify a custom port number to run the server on. The default port number is 8080.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_example_usage">Example Usage</h4>
<p>To run the tiny serve command, you can use the following examples:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">tiny-cli serve myGame.zip</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This will launch the local web server on the default port number (<code>8080</code>) and serve the game located in the <code>myGame.zip</code> file.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">tiny-cli serve MyGame.zip <span>--port</span> 8081</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This will launch the local web server on port number <code>8081</code> and serve the game located in the <code>MyGame.zip</code> file.</p>
<p>Once the server is running, you can access the game in your web browser by navigating to the URL <code><a href="http://localhost:">port number</a>/</code>. For example, if you used the default port number, you would navigate to <code><a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a></code> in your web browser to access the game.</p>
