    <h1>Toyota Fluorite: &#34;console-grade&#34; Flutter game engine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <!-- Description -->
        <p>
            <strong>Fluorite is the first console-grade game engine fully integrated with Flutter.</strong></p>

        <!-- Sections -->

         <!-- Spacer to push footer to bottom -->

        <!-- 1. High-performance ECS core -->
        <section id="ecs-core">
            <img src="https://fluorite.game/fluorite-ecs.png" alt="ECS Diagram"/>
            <div>
                <h3>High-performance ECS core</h3>
                <p>
                    At the heart of Fluorite lies a data-oriented ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture.
                    It&#39;s written in C++ to allow for maximum performance and targeted optimizations, yielding great
                    performance on lower-end/embedded hardware.
                    At the same time, it allows you to write game code using familiar high-level game APIs in Dart,
                    making most of your game development knowledge transferrable from other engines.
                </p>
            </div>

        <!-- 2. Model-defined touch trigger zones -->
        <section id="touch-zones">
            <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
                <source src="fluorite-modelgtriggerzones.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <div>
                <h3>Model-defined touch trigger zones</h3>
                <p>
                    This feature enables 3D Artists to define “clickable” zones directly in Blender, and to configure
                    them to trigger specific events!
                    Developers can then listen to <code>onClick</code> events with the specified tags to trigger all
                    sorts of interactions!
                    This simplifies the process of creating spatial 3D UI, enabling users to engage with objects and
                    controls in a more intuitive way.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- 3. Console-grade 3D Rendering -->
        <section id="3d-rendering">
            <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
                <source src="fluorite-graphics.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <div>
                <h3>Console-grade 3D Rendering</h3>
                <p>
                    Powered by Google&#39;s Filament renderer, Fluorite leverages modern graphics APIs such as Vulkan to
                    deliver stunning, hardware-accelerated visuals
                    comparable to those found on gaming consoles. With support for physically-accurate lighting and
                    assets, post-processing effects, and custom shaders,
                    the developers can create visually rich and captivating environments.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- 4. Hot Reload -->
        <section id="hot-reload">
            <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
                <source src="fluorite-hotreload.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <div>
                <h3>Hot Reload</h3>
                <p>
                    Thanks to its Flutter/Dart integration, Fluorite&#39;s scenes are enabled for Hot Reload!
                    This allows developers to update their scenes and see the changes within just a couple frames.
                    This significantly speeds up the development process, enabling rapid iteration and
                    testing of game mechanics, assets, and code.
