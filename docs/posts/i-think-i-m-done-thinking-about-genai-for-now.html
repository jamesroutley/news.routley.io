    <h1>I think I&#39;m done thinking about GenAI for now</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Like many other self-styled thinky programmer guys, I like to imagine myself as
a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes">Holmesian</a> genius,
making trenchant observations, collecting them, and then synergizing them into
brilliant deductions with the keen application of my powerful mind.</p>
<p>However, several years ago, I had an epiphany in my self-concept.  I finally
understood that, to the extent that I <em>am</em> usefully clever, it is less in a
Holmesian idiom, and more, shall I we,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Monk">Monkesque</a>.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with either of the respective franchises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holmes is a towering intellect honed by years of training, who catalogues
  intentional, systematic observations and deduces logical, factual conclusions
  from those observations.</li>
<li>Monk, on the other hand, while also a reasonably intelligent guy, is highly
  neurotic, wracked by unresolved trauma and profound grief.  As both a
  consulting job and a coping mechanism, he makes a habit of erratically
  wandering into crime scenes, and, driven by a carefully managed jenga tower
  of mental illnesses, leverages his dual inabilities to solve crimes.  First,
  he is unable to filter out apparently inconsequential details, building up a
  mental rat’s nest of trivia about the problem; second, he is unable to let go
  of any minor incongruity, obsessively ruminating on the collection of facts
  until they all make sense in a consistent timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, this tendency serves both this fictional wretch of a
detective, and myself, reasonably well.  I find annoying incongruities in
abstractions and I fidget and fiddle with them until I end up building
something that <a href="https://twisted.org">a lot of people like</a>, or perhaps
something that a smaller number of people get <a href="https://automat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><em>really</em> excited
about</a>.  At worst, at least <a href="https://fritter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><em>I</em>
eventually understand what’s going
on</a>.  This is a self-soothing
activity but it turns out that, managed properly, it can very effectively
soothe others as well.</p>
<p>All that brings us to today’s topic, which is an incongruity I cannot smooth
out or fit into a logical framework to make sense.  I am, somewhat reluctantly,
a <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2024/05/grand-unified-ai-hype.html">genAI</a>
<a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2025/03/a-bigger-database.html">skeptic</a>.  However, I am, <em>even more</em>
reluctantly, exposed to genAI Discourse every damn minute of every damn day.
It is relentless, inescapable, and exhausting.</p>
<p>This preamble about personality should hopefully help you, dear reader, to
understand how I usually address problematical ideas by thinking and thinking
and fidgeting with them until I manage to write some words — or perhaps a new
open source package — that logically orders the ideas around it in a way which
allows my brain to calm down and let it go, and how that process is important
to me.</p>
<p>In this particular instance, however, genAI has defeated me.  I cannot make it
make sense, but I need to stop thinking about it anyway.  It is too much and I
need to give up.</p>
<p>My goal with this post is not to <em>convince</em> anyone of anything in particular —
and we’ll get to why that is a bit later — but rather:</p>
<ol>
<li>to set out my current understanding in one place, including all the various
   negative feelings which are still bothering me, so I can stop repeating it
   elsewhere,</li>
<li>to explain <em>why</em> I cannot build a case that I think <em>should</em> be particularly
   convincing to anyone else, particularly to someone who actively disagrees
   with me,</li>
<li>in so doing, to illustrate why I think the discourse is so fractious and
   unresolvable, and finally</li>
<li>to give myself, and hopefully by proxy to give others in the same situation,
   permission to just peace out of this nightmare quagmire corner of the
   noosphere.</li>
</ol>
<p>But first, just because I can’t <em>prove</em> that my interlocutors are <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">Wrong On The
Internet</a>, doesn’t mean I won’t explain why I <em>feel</em>
like they are wrong.</p>
<h2 id="the-anti-antis">The Anti-Antis</h2>
<p>Most recently, at time of writing, there have been a spate of “the genAI
discourse is bad” articles, almost exclusively written from the perspective of,
not <em>boosters</em> exactly, but pragmatically minded (albeit concerned) genAI
users, wishing for the skeptics to be more pointed and accurate in our
critiques.  This is anti-anti-genAI content.</p>
<p>I am not going to link to any of these, because, as part of their
self-fulfilling prophecy about the “genAI discourse”, they’re <em>also</em> all bad.</p>
<p>Mostly, however, they had very little worthwhile to respond to because they
were straw-manning their erstwhile interlocutors.  They are all getting annoyed
at “bad genAI criticism” while failing to engage with — and often failing to
even <em>mention</em> — most of the actual <em>substance</em> of any serious genAI
criticism.  At least, any of the criticism that I’ve personally read.</p>
<p>I understand wanting to avoid a callout or Gish-gallop culture and just express
your own ideas.  So, I understand that they didn’t link directly to particular
sources or go point-by-point on anyone else’s writing.  Obviously I get it,
since that’s exactly what this post is doing too.</p>
<p>But if you’re going to talk about how bad the genAI conversation is, without
even <em>mentioning</em> huge categories of problem like “climate impact” or
“disinformation”<sup id="fnref:1:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:1:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup> even once, I honestly don’t know what conversation you’re
even talking about.  This is peak “make up a guy to get mad at” behavior, which
is especially confusing in this circumstance, because there’s an absolutely
<em>huge</em> crowd of actual people that you could already be mad at.</p>
<p>The people writing these pieces have historically seemed very thoughtful to me.
Some of them I know personally.  It is worrying to me that their critical
thinking skills appear to have substantially degraded <em>specifically</em> after
spending a bunch of time intensely using this technology which I believe has a
<em>scary</em> risk of <a href="https://skepchick.org/2025/05/chatgpt-is-creating-cult-leaders/">degrading one’s critical thinking
skills</a>.
Correlation is not causation or whatever, and sure, from a rhetorical
perspective this is “post hoc ergo propter hoc” and maybe a little “ad hominem”
for good measure, but correlation can still be <em>concerning</em>.</p>
<p>Yet, I cannot <em>effectively</em> respond to these folks, because they are making a
<em>practical</em> argument that I cannot, despite my best efforts, find compelling
evidence to refute categorically.  <em>My</em> experiences of genAI are all extremely
bad, but that is barely even anecdata.  <em>Their</em> experiences are
neutral-to-positive.  Little scientific data exists.  How to resolve this?<sup id="fnref:2:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:2:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:2">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-aesthetics">The Aesthetics</h2>
<p>As I begin to state my <em>own</em> position, let me lead with this: my factual
analysis of genAI is hopelessly negatively biased.  I find the vast majority of
the aesthetic properties of genAI to be <em>intensely</em> unpleasant.</p>
<p>I have been trying <em>very</em> hard to correct for this bias, to try to pay
attention to the facts and to have a clear-eyed view of these systems’
capabilities. But the feelings are visceral, and the effort to compensate is
tiring.  It is, in fact, the desire to stop making this <em>particular</em> kind of
effort that has me writing up this piece and trying to take an intentional
break from the subject, despite its intense relevance.</p>
<p>When I say its “aesthetic qualities” are unpleasant, I don’t just mean the
aesthetic elements of output of genAIs themselves. The aesthetic quality of
genAI writing, visual design, animation and so on, while <em>mostly</em> atrocious, is
also highly variable.  There are cherry-picked examples which look… fine.
Maybe even good.  For years now, there have been, famously, literally
award-winning aesthetic outputs of genAI<sup id="fnref:3:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:3:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While I am ideologically predisposed to see any “good” genAI art as accruing
the benefits of either a survivorship bias from thousands of terrible outputs
or simple plagiarism rather than its own inherent quality, I cannot deny that
in many cases it <em>is</em> “good”.</p>
<p>However, I am not just talking about the product, but the process; the
aesthetic experience of interfacing with the genAI system itself, rather than
the aesthetic experience of the outputs of that system.</p>
<p>I am not a visual artist and I am not really a writer<sup id="fnref:4:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:4:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:4">4</a></sup>, particularly not a
writer of fiction or anything else whose experience is primarily aesthetic.  So
I will speak directly to the experience of software development.</p>
<p>I have seen very few successful examples of using genAI to produce whole,
working systems.  There are no shortage of highly public <a href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny/114622547164112473">miserable
failures</a>, particularly
from <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1krttqo/my_new_hobby_watching_ai_slowly_drive_microsoft/">the vendors of these systems
themselves</a>,
where the outputs are confused, self-contradictory, full of subtle errors and
generally unusable.  While few studies exist, it sure <em>looks</em> like this is an
automated way of producing a <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?NetNegativeProducingProgrammer">Net Negative Productivity
Programmer</a>, throwing out
chaff to slow down the rest of the team.<sup id="fnref:5:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:5:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Juxtapose this with my aforementioned psychological motivations, to wit, I want
to have everything in the computer be <em>orderly</em> and <em>make sense</em>, I’m sure most
of you would have no trouble imagining that sitting through this sort of
practice would make me <em>extremely</em> unhappy.</p>
<p>Despite this plethora of negative experiences, executives are aggressively
mandating the use of AI<sup id="fnref:6:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:6:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:6">6</a></sup>.  It looks like <em>without</em> such mandates, most
people will not bother to use such tools, so the executives will need muscular
policies to enforce its use.<sup id="fnref:7:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:7:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Being forced to sit and argue with a robot while it struggles and fails to
produce a working output, while you have to rewrite the code at the end anyway,
is incredibly demoralizing.  This is the kind of activity that activates <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/07/6-causes-of-burnout-and-how-to-avoid-them">every
single major cause of
burnout</a> at
once.</p>
<p>But, at least in that scenario, the thing <em>ultimately doesn’t work</em>, so there’s
a hope that after a very stressful six month pilot program, you can go to
management with a pile of meticulously collected evidence, and shut the whole
thing down.</p>
<p>I am inclined to believe that, in fact, it doesn’t work well enough to be used
this way, and that we are going to see a big crash.  But that is not the most
aesthetically distressing thing.  The most distressing thing is that maybe it
<em>does</em> work; if not well enough to actually do the work, at least ambiguously
enough to fool the executives long-term.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider?tab=readme-ov-file#written-using-claude">This
project</a>,
in particular, stood out to me as an example.  Its author, a self-professed “AI
skeptic” who “thought LLMs were glorified Markov chain generators that didn’t
actually understand code and couldn’t produce anything novel”, did a
green-field project to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Now, this particular project is not <em>totally</em> inconsistent with a world in
which LLMs cannot produce anything novel.  One could imagine that, out in the
world of open source, perhaps there is enough “OAuth provider written in
TypeScript” blended up into the slurry of “borrowed<sup id="fnref:8:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:8:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:8">8</a></sup>” training data that the
minor constraint of “make it work on Cloudflare Workers” is a small tweak<sup id="fnref:9:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:9:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:9">9</a></sup>. It
is not fully dispositive of the question of the viability of “genAI coding”.</p>
<p>But it is a data point related to that question, and thus it did make me
contend with what might happen if it <em>were</em> actually a fully demonstrative
example.  I reviewed the commit history, as the author suggested.  For the sake
of argument, I tried to ask myself if I would like working this way.  Just for
clarity on this question, I wanted to suspend judgement about everything else;
assuming:</p>
<ul>
<li>the model could be created with ethically, legally, voluntarily sourced
  training data</li>
<li>its usage involved consent from labor rather than authoritarian mandates</li>
<li>sensible levels of energy expenditure, with minimal CO2 impact</li>
<li>it is substantially more efficient to work this way than to just write the
  code yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on, and so on… would I <em>like</em> to use this magic robot that could mostly
just emit working code for me?  Would I use it if it were <em>free</em>, in all senses
of the word?</p>
<p>No. I absolutely would not.</p>
<p>I found the experience of reading this commit history and imagining myself
using such a tool — without exaggeration — nauseating.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=i+hate+code+review">many programmers</a>, I love
code review.  I find that it is one of the best parts of the process of
programming.  I can help people learn, and develop their skills, and learn
<em>from</em> them, and appreciate the decisions they made, develop an impression of a
fellow programmer’s style.  It’s a great way to build a mutual theory of mind.</p>
<p>Of course, it can still be really annoying; people make mistakes, often can’t
see things I find obvious, and in particular when you’re reviewing a lot of
code from a lot of different people, you often end up having to repeat
explanations of the <em>same</em> mistakes.  So I can see why many programmers,
particularly those more introverted than I am, hate it.</p>
<p>But, ultimately, when I review their code and work hard to provide clear and
actionable feedback, people learn and grow and it’s worth that investment in
inconvenience.</p>
<p>The process of coding with an “agentic” LLM appears to be the process of
carefully distilling all the worst parts of code review, and removing and
discarding all of its benefits.</p>
<p>The lazy, dumb, lying robot asshole keeps making the same mistakes over and
over again, never improving, never genuinely reacting, always obsequiously
<em>pretending</em> to take your feedback on board.</p>
<p>Even when it “does” actually “understand” and manages to load your instructions
into its context window, 200K tokens later it will slide cleanly out of its
memory and you will have to say it again.</p>
<p>All the while, it is attempting to trick you.  It gets most things right, but
it consistently makes mistakes in the places that you are least likely to
notice.  In places where a person <em>wouldn’t</em> make a mistake.  Your brain keeps
trying to develop a theory of mind to predict its behavior but there’s no mind
there, so it always behaves infuriatingly randomly.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/_2C2CNmK7dQ">I don’t think I am the only one who feels this way.</a></p>
<h2 id="the-affordances">The Affordances</h2>
<p>Whatever our environments <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">afford</a>,
we tend to do more of.  Whatever they resist, we tend to do less of.  So in a
world where we were all writing all of our code and emails and blog posts and
texts to each other with LLMs, what do they afford that existing tools do not?</p>
<p>As a weirdo who enjoys code review, I also enjoy process engineering.  The
central question of almost all process engineering is to continuously ask: how
shall we shape our tools, to better shape ourselves?</p>
<p>LLMs are an affordance for <em>producing more text, faster</em>.  How is that going to
shape us?</p>
<p>Again arguing in the alternative here, assuming the text is free from errors
and hallucinations and whatever, it’s all correct and fit for purpose, that
means it reduces the pain of circumstances where you have to repeat yourself.
Less pain!  Sounds great; I don’t like pain.</p>
<p>Every codebase has places where you need boilerplate.  Every organization has
defects in its information architecture that require repetition of certain
information rather than a link back to the authoritative source of truth.
Often, these problems persist for a very long time, because it is difficult to
overcome the institutional inertia required to make real progress rather than
going along with the status quo.  But this is often where the highest-value
projects can be found. <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/408900.html">Where there’s muck, there’s
brass</a>.</p>
<p>The process-engineering function of an LLM, therefore, is to prevent
fundamental problems from ever getting fixed, to reward the rapid-fire
overwhelm of infrastructure teams with an immediate, catastrophic cascade of
legacy code that is now much harder to delete than it is to write.</p>
<hr/>
<p>There is a scene in Game of Thrones where Khal Drogo kills himself.  He does so
by replacing a stinging, burning, therapeutic antiseptic wound dressing with
some cool, soothing mud.  The mud felt nice, addressed the immediate pain,
removed the discomfort of the antiseptic, and immediately gave him a lethal
infection.</p>
<p>The pleasing feeling of immediate progress when one prompts an LLM to solve
some problem feels like cool mud on my brain.</p>
<h3 id="the-economics">The Economics</h3>
<p>We are in the middle of a <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2024/05/grand-unified-ai-hype.html">mania</a> around
this technology.  As I have written about before, I believe the mania will end.
There will then be a crash, and a “winter”.  But, as I may not have stressed
sufficiently, this crash will be the biggest of its kind — so big, that it is
arguably not of a kind at all.  The level of investment in these technologies
is <em>bananas</em> and the possibility that the investors will recoup their
investment seems close to zero.  Meanwhile, that cost keeps going up, and up,
and up.</p>
<p>Others have reported on this in detail<sup id="fnref:10:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:10:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:10">10</a></sup>, and I will not reiterate that all
here, but in addition to being a looming and scary industry-wide (if we are
lucky; more likely it’s probably “world-wide”) economic threat, it is also
going to drive some panicked behavior from management.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_panic">Panicky behavior from management</a>
stressed that their idea is not panning out is, famously, the cause of much
human misery.  I expect that even in the “good” scenario, where <em>some</em> profit
is ultimately achieved, will still involve mass layoffs rocking the industry,
panicked re-hiring, destruction of large amounts of wealth.</p>
<p>It feels bad to think about this.</p>
<h3 id="the-energy-usage">The Energy Usage</h3>
<p>For a long time I believed that the energy impact was overstated.  I am even on
record, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@glyph/112242020641010867">about a year ago</a>,
saying I didn’t think the energy usage was a big deal.  I think I was wrong
about that.</p>
<p>It initially seemed like it was letting regular old data centers off the hook.
But recently I have learned that, while the numbers are incomplete because the
vendors aren’t sharing information, they’re also <em>extremely</em> bad.<sup id="fnref:11:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:11:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>I think there’s probably a version of this technology that isn’t a climate
emergency nightmare, but that’s not the version that the general public has
access to today.</p>
<h2 id="the-educational-impact">The Educational Impact</h2>
<p>LLMs are making academic cheating <em>incredibly</em> rampant.<sup id="fnref:12:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:12:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Not only is it so common as to be nearly universal, it’s also extremely harmful
to learning.<sup id="fnref:13:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:13:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>For learning, genAI is a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samhalpert.bsky.social/post/3lmt3coqvqk2w">forklift at the
gym</a>.</p>
<p>To some extent, LLMs are simply revealing a structural rot within education and
academia that has been building for decades if not centuries.  But it was
within those inefficiencies and the inconveniences of the academic experience
that real learning <em>was</em>, against all odds, still happening in schools.</p>
<p>LLMs produce a frictionless, streamlined process where students can
effortlessly glide through the entire credential, learning nothing.  Once
again, they dull the pain without regard to its cause.</p>
<p>This is not good.</p>
<h2 id="the-invasion-of-privacy">The Invasion of Privacy</h2>
<p>This is obviously only a problem with the big cloud models, but then, the big
cloud models are the only ones that people actually use.  If you are having
conversations about anything private with ChatGPT, you are sending all of that
private information directly to Sam Altman, to do with as he wishes.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t think he is a particularly bad guy, maybe he won’t even
create the privacy nightmare on purpose.  Maybe he will be forced to do so as a
result of some bizarre kafkaesque accident.<sup id="fnref:14:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:14:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Imagine the scenario, for example, where a woman is tracking her cycle and
uploading the logs to ChatGPT so she can chat with it about a health concern.
Except, surprise, you don’t have to imagine, you can just search for it, as <em>I</em>
have personally, organically, seen three separate women on YouTube, at least
one of whom <em>lives in Texas</em>, not only do this on camera but <em>recommend doing
this to their audiences</em>.</p>
<p>Citation links withheld on this particular claim for hopefully obvious reasons.</p>
<p>I assure you that I am neither particularly interested in menstrual products
nor genAI content, and if <em>I</em> am seeing this more than once, it is probably a
distressingly large trend.</p>
<h2 id="the-stealing">The Stealing</h2>
<p>The training data for LLMs is stolen.  I don’t mean like “pirated” in the sense
where someone illicitly shares a copy they obtained legitimately; I mean their
scrapers are ignoring both norms<sup id="fnref:15:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:15:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:15">15</a></sup> and laws<sup id="fnref:16:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:16:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:16">16</a></sup> to obtain copies under false
pretenses, destroying other people’s infrastructure<sup id="fnref:17:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:17:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:17">17</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="the-fatigue">The Fatigue</h2>
<p>I have provided references to numerous articles outlining rhetorical and
sometimes data-driven cases for the existence of certain properties and
consequences of genAI tools.  But I can’t <em>prove</em> any of these properties,
either at a point in time or as a durable ongoing problem.</p>
<p>The LLMs themselves are simply too large to model with the usual kind of
heuristics one would use to think about software.  I’d sooner be able to
predict the physics of dice in a casino than a 2 trillion parameter neural
network.  They resist scientific understanding, not just because of their size
and complexity, but because unlike a natural phenomenon (which could of course
be considerably larger and more complex) they <em>resist experimentation</em>.</p>
<p>The first form of genAI resistance to experiment is that every discussion is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy">motte-and-bailey</a>.  If
I use a free model and get a bad result I’m told it’s because I should have
used the paid model.  If I get a bad result with ChatGPT I should have used
Claude. If I get a bad result with a chatbot I need to start using an agentic
tool. If an agentic tool deletes my hard drive by putting <code>os.system(“rm -rf
~/”)</code> into <code>sitecustomize.py</code> then I guess I should have built my own MCP
integration with a completely novel heretofore never even considered security
sandbox or something?</p>
<p>What configuration, exactly, would let me make a categorical claim about these
things?  What specific methodological approach should I stick to, to get
reliably adequate prompts?</p>
<p>For the record though, if the idea of the free models is that they are going to
be provocative demonstrations of the impressive capabilities of the commercial
models, and the results are consistently dogshit, I am finding it increasingly
<a href="https://ioc.exchange/@kevinriggle/114617713278070348">hard to care</a> how much
better the paid ones are supposed to be, especially since the “better”-ness
cannot really be quantified in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>The motte-and-bailey doesn’t stop there though.  It’s a war on all fronts.
Concerned about energy usage?  That’s OK, you can use a local model.  Concerned
about infringement?  That’s okay, somewhere, somebody, maybe, has figured out
how to train models consensually<sup id="fnref:18:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:18:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:18">18</a></sup>.  Worried about the politics of enriching
the richest monsters in the world?  Don’t worry, you can always download an
“open source” model from Hugging Face.  It doesn’t matter that many of these
properties are mutually exclusive and attempting to fix one breaks two others;
there’s always an answer, the field is so abuzz with so many people trying to
pull in so many directions at once that it is legitimately difficult to
understand what’s going on.</p>
<p>Even here though, I can see that characterizing everything this way is unfair
to a hypothetical sort of person.  If there is someone working at one of these
thousands of AI companies that have been springing up like toadstools after a
rain, and they <em>really are</em> solving one of these extremely difficult problems,
how can I handwave that away?  We need people working on problems, that’s like,
the whole point of having an economy.  And I really don’t like shitting on
other people’s earnest efforts, so I try not to dismiss whole fields.  Given
how AI has gotten into <em>everything</em>, in a way that e.g. cryptocurrency never
did, painting with that broad a brush inevitably ends up tarring a bunch of
stuff that isn’t even really AI at all.</p>
<p>The second form of genAI resistance to experiment is the inherent obfuscation
of productization.  The models themselves are already complicated enough, but
the <em>products</em> that are built around the models are evolving extremely rapidly.
ChatGPT is not just a “model”, and with the rapid<sup id="fnref:19:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:19:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:19">19</a></sup> deployment of Model
Context Protocol tools, the edges of all these things will blur even further.
Every LLM is now just an enormous unbounded soup of arbitrary software doing
arbitrary whatever.  How could I possibly get my arms around that to understand
it?</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>I have woefully little experience with these tools.</p>
<p>I’ve tried them out a little bit, and almost every single time the result has
been a disaster that has not made me curious to push further.  Yet, I keep
hearing from all over the industry that I should.</p>
<p>To some extent, I feel like the motte-and-bailey characterization above is
fair; if the technology itself can really do real software development, it
ought to be able to do it in multiple modalities, and there’s nothing anyone
can <em>articulate</em> to me about GPT-4o which puts it in a fundamentally different
class than GPT-3.5.</p>
<p>But, also, I consistently hear that the <em>subjective experience</em> of using the
premium versions of the tools is actually good, and the free ones are actually
bad.</p>
<p>I keep struggling to find ways to try them “the right way”, the way that people
I know and otherwise respect claim to be using them, but I haven’t managed to
do so in any meaningful way yet.</p>
<p>I do not want to be using the cloud versions of these models with their
potentially hideous energy demands; I’d like to use a local model.  But there
is obviously not a nicely composed way to use local models like this.</p>
<p>Since there are apparently <em>zero</em> models with ethically-sourced training data,
and litigation is ongoing<sup id="fnref:20:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:20:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:20">20</a></sup> to determine the legal relationships of training
data and outputs, even if I can be comfortable with some level of plagiarism on
a project, I don’t feel that I can introduce the existential legal risk into
<a href="https://pypi.org/user/glyph/">other people’s infrastructure</a>, so I would need
to make a <em>new</em> project.</p>
<p>Others have differing opinions of course, including some within my dependency
chain, which does worry me, but I still don’t feel like I can freely contribute
further to the problem; it’s going to be bad enough to unwind any impact
upstream.  Even just for my own sake, I don’t want to make it worse.</p>
<p>This especially presents a problem because I have <a href="https://mastodon.social/@glyph/112498550495367755">way too much stuff going
on</a> already.  A new project
is not practical.</p>
<p>Finally, even if I <em>did</em> manage to satisfy all of my quirky<sup id="fnref:21:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:21:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:21">21</a></sup> constraints,
would this experiment really be worth anything?  The models and tools that
people are raving about are the big, expensive, harmful ones.  If I proved to
myself yet again that a small model with bad tools was unpleasant to use, I
wouldn’t really be addressing my opponents’ views.</p>
<p>I’m stuck.</p>
<h2 id="the-surrender">The Surrender</h2>
<p>I am writing this piece to make <em>my</em> peace with giving up on this topic, at
least for a while.  While I do idly hope that some folks might find bits of it
convincing, and perhaps find ways to be more mindful with their own usage of
genAI tools, and consider the harm they may be causing, that’s not actually the
goal.  And that is not the goal because it is just so much goddamn <em>work</em> to
prove.</p>
<p>Here, I must return to my philosophical hobbyhorse of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy)">sprachspiel</a>.  In
this case, specifically to use it as an analytical tool, not just to understand
<em>what</em> I am trying to say, but what the <em>purpose</em> for my speech is.</p>
<p>The concept of sprachspiel is most frequently deployed to describe the <em>goal</em>
of the language game being played, but in game theory, that’s only half the
story.  Speech — particularly rigorously justified speech — has a <em>cost</em>, as
well as a benefit.  I can make shit up pretty easily, but if I want to do
anything remotely like scientific or academic rigor, that cost can be
astronomical.  In the case of developing an abstract understanding of LLMs, the
cost is just too high.</p>
<p>So what is my goal, then?  To be king Canute, standing astride the shore of
“tech”, whatever that is, commanding the LLM tide not to rise?  This is a
multi-trillion dollar juggernaut.</p>
<p>Even the rump, loser, also-ran fragment of it has the power to literally
suffocate us in our homes<sup id="fnref:22:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:22:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:22">22</a></sup> if they so choose, completely insulated from any
consequence.  If the power curve starts there, imagine what the <em>winners</em> in
this industry are going to be capable of, irrespective of the technology
they’re building - just with the resources they have to hand.  Am I going to
write a blog post that can rival their propaganda apparatus?  Doubtful.</p>
<p>Instead, I will just have to concede that maybe I’m wrong.  I don’t have the
skill, or the knowledge, or the energy, to demonstrate with any level of rigor
that LLMs are generally, in fact, hot garbage.  Intellectually, I will have to
acknowledge that maybe the boosters are right.  Maybe it’ll be OK.</p>
<p>Maybe the carbon emissions aren’t so bad.  Maybe everybody is keeping them
secret in ways that they don’t for other types of datacenter for perfectly
legitimate reasons.  Maybe the tools really can write novel and correct code,
and with a little more tweaking, it won’t be so difficult to get them to do it.
Maybe by the time they become a mandatory condition of access to developer
tools, they won’t be miserable.</p>
<p>Sure, I even sincerely agree, intellectual property really has been a pretty
bad idea from the beginning.  Maybe it’s OK that we’ve made an exception to
those rules.  The rules were stupid anyway, so what does it matter if we let a
few billionaires break them?  Really, everybody should be able to break them
(although of course, regular people can’t, because we can’t afford the lawyers
to fight off the MPAA and RIAA, but that’s a problem with the legal system, not
tech).</p>
<p>I come not to praise “AI skepticism”, but to bury it.</p>
<p>Maybe it really is all going to be fine.  Perhaps I am simply catastrophizing;
I have been known to do that from time to time.  I can even sort of believe it,
in my head.  Still, even after writing all this out, I can’t quite manage to
believe it in the pit of my stomach.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that feeling is not something that you, or I, can argue with.</p>
