    <h1>Ask HN: How to Learn to Sell?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey HN,</p><p>I am a solo founder that just finished writing code for my project (MVP) and am ready to find clients.</p><p>- for the sake of the question, my clients will be small physical businesses. Think, Family Doctor&#39;s Office, Local Cafe, Small barber, etc.</p><p>I will be developing a blog for SEO purposes and doing other things to promote my business online. However, I believe the key to success here will be &#34;Cold Sales&#34;. I have never done that before. So, if you could recommend a book, a blog post, other online resources, or you just have a random advice that I could learn from, I would be very thankful.</p><p>Suffice it to say I will be starting out ASAP, even though I don&#39;t know anything. I believe practice is the best teacher. However, if there are any resources that could help me get up and running quicker that would be awesome. Thanks a ton in advance.</p></div></div></div>
