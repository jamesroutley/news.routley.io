    <h1>Ending Junk Fees, the Most Annoying Thing in American Commerce</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>Welcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you’re already signed up, great! If you’d like to sign up and receive issues over email, you can do so </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/subscribe" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></em></p><p><span>Last week, I wrote up the problem of inflation, noting that people aren’t just mad at high prices, but at </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-price-fixing-economy" rel="">unfair</a><span> prices. I brought up one of the most annoying features of American commerce, which is known as the junk fee. We’ve all experienced these in one form or another. You go to a hotel, and instead of being given the price quoted to you online, they add a $25 “amenity” fee, or “resort” fee, or something like that. </span></p><p>It’s not just hotels who charge undisclosed fees, but banks, rental car companies, landlords, live event firms, auto dealers, restaurants, phone companies, internet service firms, universities, private airports, prisons, movie theaters, credit card companies, etc. Junk fees are indeed everywhere - aircraft owners have to deal with hidden charges by Fixed Base Operators, and independent pharmacists have to put up with endless fees from pharmacy benefit managers.</p><p><span>Such cheating is pervasive at this point, built into the business model of firms across the economy. According to Consumer Reports, 85% of Americans “have experienced a hidden or unexpected fee for a service in the previous two years,” and 96% found them “highly annoying” and said they were paying more in hidden charges than they were five years ago. There’s even an airline-specific consulting firm, </span><a href="https://ideaworkscompany.com/" rel="">IdeaWorks</a><span>, that releases regular reports cheering on the industry for increasing fees. (I’m not kidding, just browse the press release section of its website.)</span></p><p>Junk fees are the flip side of consolidation, because they force prices up across the board by breaking the very structure of a market and forcing even honest actors into cheating. Here’s how. The lifeblood of a market with buyers and sellers is public pricing information, because public pricing helps match buyers and sellers based on a mutually agreed upon amount. Typically, consumers will buy tickets or hotel rooms based on price comparison sites, which show a list price. An unscrupulous firm which lists a hidden fee has an advantage, since its list price will look lower than a firm without such a hidden fee. A buyer will purchase the good or service, and then end up paying a higher price when the hidden fee is added back in. But in addition, the honest firm loses a sale, and ultimately, will either start charging its own hidden fees or go out of business. Put differently, junk fees are a form of mass deception, and they turn everyone into a cheater. </p><p>Junk fees, in other words, are a low-grade form of fraud. So why, exactly, are they legal? I’m going to answer that, but it’s important to note that they may not be legal for very much longer. On Tuesday, the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, and the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, unveiled a series of proposed regulations to ban these fees by forcing disclosure of the total price of goods and services. </p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/r207011unfairjunkfeesnprmfinal.pdf" rel="">new proposed rule</a><span> from the FTC is simple.

Later this month, the CFPB will also put forward a rule letting you change bank accounts more easily, forcing banks to let you transfer your bank transaction data to another bank or financial services firm, so you can easily move banks and not have to redo all the auto-pay stuff.</p><p>The coverage of these attacks on junk fees has been uniformly positive, because, well, everyone has experience with being cheated at this point. The Today Show, the New York Times, NPR, lots of local news, covered it, and even people who despise anti-monopoly regulators, like the anchors on CNBC, offered praise.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/econliberties/status/1712816522257711491" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f83ee9-e065-4152-b9aa-f0f45d3a777b_507x272.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f83ee9-e065-4152-b9aa-f0f45d3a777b_507x272.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f83ee9-e065-4152-b9aa-f0f45d3a777b_507x272.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f83ee9-e065-4152-b9aa-f0f45d3a777b_507x272.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f83ee9-e065-4152-b9aa-f0f45d3a777b_507x272.png" width="507" height="272" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/91f83ee9-e065-4152-b9aa-f0f45d3a777b_507x272.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:272,&#34;width&#34;:507,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:254624,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:&#34;https://twitter.com/econliberties/status/1712816522257711491&#34;,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f83ee9-e065-4152-b9aa-f0f45d3a777b_507x272.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f83ee9-e065-4152-b9aa-f0f45d3a777b_507x272.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f83ee9-e065-4152-b9aa-f0f45d3a777b_507x272.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f83ee9-e065-4152-b9aa-f0f45d3a777b_507x272.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>It’s obviously a heavy foreign policy week, but junk fees are so annoying and pervasive that President Biden </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/us/politics/biden-israel-economy.html" rel="">took time</a><span> to talk up how his regulators are attacking the problem.</span></p><p><span>Banning junk fees might seem obvious - the sort of pedestrian work of competent regulators. And it is. But it also brings up a simple question. Why didn’t anyone in regulatory positions stop these fees years ago? It’s not like they are totally new.

Basically, everyone hates being cheated.</span></p><p><span>Talking about monopolies is a bit tricky, because a corporation is an abstraction. And firms slide behind slick public relations, or have some argument that makes it a bit difficult to figure out why some services got worse. But in late 2022, when Ticketmaster </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/dont-make-taylor-swift-fans-angry" rel="">couldn’t sell</a><span> Taylor Swift tickets, or charged egregious fees while doing so, the public, in unison, pointed at the company and screamed “MONOPOLY!” Much of the focus was on hidden fees, which push up prices dramatically.</span></p><p>Normally, or at least in my lifetime, such public anger means little, as governments don’t always respond to civic frustration. But we’ve made a lot of progress, at least in some areas. There’s an antitrust investigation into Ticketmaster, which is ongoing. But challenging individual firms with market power isn’t the only route to addressing political economy problems. Regulators can also write rules to push corporations into competing based on quality and price instead of who is better at cheating. They can ban things like junk fees. And right now, that’s what they are doing.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p><span>And please send me tips on weird monopolies, stories I’ve missed, or comments by clicking on the title of this newsletter.
