<p>If you&#39;ve asked anybody who&#39;s tried to sell anything on Facebook Marketplace, Offerup or Craigslist, I can guarantee you that every one of them have encountered somebody trying to scam them. I&#39;ve encountered quite a few but I&#39;ll explain how this particular scam works and how bad UI contributes to scammers being successful.</p>

<p>I recently posted a laptop for sale on Facebook Marketplace and immediately got a somebody interested. I know it&#39;s a scam right away because of the language they use. They never say they&#39;re interested in the Macbook or laptop or computer. They always say things like &#34;what&#39;s the present condition of the item&#34;, &#34;what&#39;s the final asking price&#34;, and &#34;i will pay you to  ship it.&#34; </p>
