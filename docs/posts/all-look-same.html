				<h3>Faces</h3>
				<p>These are photos taken in New York City. The people who appear in these pictures are 100% Chinese, Japanese or Korean; nobody is mixed.</p>

				<h3>Modern Art</h3>
				<p>These are images from the museum exhibit at Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in Italy entitled “AllLookSame?” (Seriously, no kidding).</p>

				<h3>Traditional Architecture</h3>
				<p>This is not as easy as one might think. If it&#39;s a Buddhist temple, for instance, it&#39;s a Buddhist temple regardless of where it is located.</p>

				<h3>Travel Photography by Moon Lee</h3>
				<p>These are photos taken by Moon Lee as he traveled through Asia. You can check out more of his great photos at his site, <a href="http://moonlee.org" target="_blank">moonlee.org</a>.</p>

				<h3>Urban Scenery</h3>
				<p>This is a tricky one too since modernization tends to make everything look the same. I avoided photos that contained signs that are too obvious, like the letters that are unique to each culture.</p>

				<h3>Food</h3>
				<p>Keep in mind that the food cultures are constantly being imported and exported. This is not a test of identifying the origin. The answers are based on where the pictures were taken. For instance, noodle was invented in China, but both Korea and Japan adapted it in different ways.</p>

				<h3>Architectural Details</h3>
				<p>These are photos that show architectural details such as patterns.</p>
