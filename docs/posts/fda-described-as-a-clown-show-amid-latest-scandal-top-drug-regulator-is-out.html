    <h1>FDA described as a &#34;clown show&#34; amid latest scandal; top drug regulator is out</h1>

<p>In September, Tidmarsh went after Tang’s Aurinia and its drug voclosporin that treats lupus nephritis, a disease in which the immune system attacks the kidneys. In a startling post on his LinkedIn account, Tidmarsh claimed that the FDA-approved drug had not been shown to provide “hard” clinical benefit and that the drugmaker had not performed necessary trials.</p>
<p>Such a post from the FDA’s top drugmaker turned heads. Aurinia claims its share price fell 20 percent in a matter of hours, dropping $350 million in market value.</p>
<h2>“Embarrassing”</h2>
<p>Aurinia pushed back in the lawsuit, saying that the drug had undergone a full FDA approval process—not an abbreviated one—and been assessed based on a validated surrogate endpoint that is known to predict clinical outcomes. Further, the drug has been approved for use in 36 other countries in addition to the US.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Tidmarsh offered his resignation, but on Monday, pharmaceutical industry publication <a href="https://endpoints.news/day-after-resigning-tidmarsh-now-says-hell-fight-exit-from-fda/">Endpoints News reported</a> that Tidmarsh had notified FDA staff that he planned to fight the investigation and was reconsidering his decision to resign.</p>
<p>If the allegations in Aurinia’s lawsuit are true, Tidmarsh’s behavior would be egregious for a federal regulator. But already, the claims and other scandals have outsiders concerned that the high-stakes “soap opera” is destroying the agency’s credibility, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/04/fda-in-disarray-expert-analysis-george-tidmarsh-scandal/">as Stat reported Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>“We are witnessing nothing less than a clown show at FDA right now,” one venture capital investor told the outlet. “For the sake of patients, we need a stable and consistent FDA!”</p>
<p>“What’s happening at the top of the FDA is embarrassing,” a portfolio manager at a large biotech fund added. “How am I supposed to convince people, other investors, that this sector is doing important work when the leaders of the FDA are acting this way?”</p>
