Here&#39;s a couple of screenshots from my new text editor:

</p><p>
I like plain text. I also like doodling while I write. Some things are just
easier to explain with a picture. But if I need to draw a picture today, I
need to stop writing plain text, pick an app, dismiss a couple of dialogs or
tours of new features in front of my face, think about all the ways it&#39;s
acting for its creators rather than for me, copy my text into it, draw my
picture—and then I don&#39;t have plain text anymore. I end up with some
bloated format that only one or two apps can open. Apps that <em>may</em> be
well-behaved now, but tomorrow? Who knows?

</p><p>
What <em>is</em> plain text, anyway? It&#39;s a way to interpret a sequence of
bytes that a lot of people had to gradually invent a long time ago, now baked
so deep into our computers that we take it for granted. It&#39;s simpler than pdf,
but it&#39;s not trivial (oh hi there Unicode). Too bad the inventors of plain
text didn&#39;t have a graphical screen or a mouse. Or is it? What if we pretend
we can go back in time, and create a transparent, gracefully degrading
plain-text format that is trivial to build viewers and editors for?

</p><p>
Presenting lines.love. Initially it&#39;s a vanilla text editor.

</p><p>
<img src="http://akkartik.name/lines/1.png"/>

</p><p>
You can type some text into it.

</p><p>
<img src="http://akkartik.name/lines/2.png"/>

</p><p>
Some more.

</p><p>

</p><p>
If you look inside the file, you see plain text.

</p><pre>$ cat lines.txt
Hi there.

I am some text.
</pre>

</div>

<p>
But what are those little boxes?

</p><p>
<img src="http://akkartik.name/lines/4.png"/>

</p><p>
Click on one, and you get a space you can draw in.

</p><p>
<img src="http://akkartik.name/lines/5.png"/>

</p><p>
Here&#39;s a line.

</p><p>
<img src="http://akkartik.name/lines/6.png"/>

</p><p>
And it&#39;s still plain text.

</p><pre>$ cat text
Hi there.
```lines
{&#34;p2&#34;:{&#34;x&#34;:141,&#34;y&#34;:85},&#34;mode&#34;:&#34;line&#34;,&#34;p1&#34;:{&#34;x&#34;:34,&#34;y&#34;:44}}
```

I am some text.
</pre>

<p>
Text you type in will always be readable. The drawings take a little code to
display, but not much (see below). If you find yourself in a situation where
you can&#39;t display them, well you still have the plain text. And the warm
fuzzies that you <em>have</em> a picture you <em>could</em> look at under
slightly better circumstances.

</p><p>
<em>some details</em>

</p><p>
The raw bytes that currently encode each line are nothing special. We could
and should standardize them across multiple viewers, browsers and text
editors. Teach programming environments to ignore them just like comments.

</p><p>
My current representation always divides up the page width into 256 parts so
that each co-ordinate fits in a single byte. That feels like enough resolution
for simple line drawings. Instead of the above syntax combining Markdown and
JSON, I could use a Unicode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas">private
use area</a> to define bytes that mean “line,” “circle”
and so on.

</p><h3>the app</h3><p>

I&#39;ve tried really hard to make this easy to try out, reliable and above all,
<em>safe</em> for you. (I actually spent a few years building my own computer
from scratch so I could have perfect control over security, but anyways. This
way is easier and almost just as good.)

</p><p>
<em>Step 1.</em> Download <a href="https://love2d.org">LÖVE</a> (~5MB). Follow
the usual process for your OS to install it. If you need help, <a href="http://akkartik.name/contact">just
reach out</a> any time, day or night.

</p><p>
(Take a moment here to appreciate the fine folks at LÖVE. They&#39;ve built a
marvel that is open source and easy for programmers to build and audit. You
can now also try out a few thousand other games and tools on <a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-love2d">itch.io</a>,
most of them also open source and easy to take apart. I just love how this
eco-system rewards curiosity.)

</p><p>
<em>Step 2.</em> Download <a href="https://tilde.club/~akkartik/lines.love">lines.love</a>
(38KB).

</p><p>
<em>Step 3.</em> Double-click on it and start writing. Or drag a (sub-50KB)
file on to the window to edit it. (Make a backup first, though. I&#39;ve been
using it for a few weeks without issues, but lines.love comes with no warranties.
See the GPLv2 license inside the download—which is just a zip file—for
more details.)

</p><p>
And that&#39;s it! For the most part I&#39;ve tried to make all the drawing-related
features fade into the background when you&#39;re not drawing. It&#39;s plain text,
it&#39;s mostly just for writing. Infinite undo, autosave, modern features like
that.

</p><p>
But <em>when</em> you need a drawing and click on one of those boxes, I want
this to be as quick and easy to draw a few lines with as pen and paper. No
searching for a menu to enter drawing mode, going into a whole new environment
where you can&#39;t see what you wrote (I&#39;m looking at you, Google Docs), and
hitting save before you can see the drawing in your doc.

</p><p>
For example, pen and paper lets me change my mind mid-stroke. Google docs—with
all its nested menu strips and levels on levels of tools—can&#39;t do that.
To make drawing as natural as possible, I assume you have one hand on the
mouse or touchpad and the other hand on the keyboard. If you start out drawing
and realize you&#39;re drawing a line, when really you need a circle, just press
<span>o</span> without releasing the mouse. <a href="http://akkartik.name/lines/7.webm">Check
out this 10-second video.</a>

</p><p>
(Notice the subtle little hint of the current drawing mode in the top right of
the drawing. See how it switches to a circle after I hit <span>o</span>
on the keyboard.)

</p><p>
Using the keyboard and mouse together like this will feel new at first. There
are a few shortcuts to familiarize yourself with, though not many. To see a
list of shortcuts available when drawing, hover on a drawing and then press
<span>ctrl-h</span> for context-sensitive help. Hit <span>esc</span>
to dismiss help. You can also start a stroke and hold down <span>h</span>
to see your options in the <em>middle</em> of a stroke.

</p><p>
(I require <span>ctrl-</span> chords when not pressing the mouse
so that you don&#39;t accidentally modify a drawing when you were typing text,
just because the mouse happened to fall within a drawing as you typed.)

</p><p>
This is getting long, so I&#39;ll stop here. Try out <a href="">lines.love</a> and
<a href="http://akkartik.name/contact">tell me</a> what you think. No question or issue is too
small.

</p><p>
P.S. If you&#39;re interested in poking under the hood, lines.love is just a .zip
file and it contains the full (few hundred lines of) source code for the app.
If you have questions, I have answers!
