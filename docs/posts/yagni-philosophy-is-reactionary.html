<p>I see that one of <a href="https://www.bitecode.dev/p/hype-cycles">those reactionary YAGNI articles</a> is making the rounds. Most of these articles focus on the technologies themselves and forget that the developers behind them or using them are curious, enthusiastic and often extremely competent. There&#39;s a lot to criticize about &#34;hype&#34; cycles, but technology itself ain&#39;t it.</p>
<p>What is worth criticizing in &#34;hype&#34; cycles is that systemic misaligned incentives—a result of both market pressure and the way to have a successful career within company structures—lead to baroque software stacks of dubious quality and not lean, successful and elegant products.</p>
<p>What actually sucks is getting told to use &#34;AI&#34; for no good reason because someone wants to score a checkbox for Q3; because company culture and structure don&#39;t allow people to push back against CTOs and CEOs pushing some product because they read their vendor&#39;s whitepaper; because sales is incentivized to pump grandiose nonsense about half-finished technology. All of this leads to products designed as a side-effect of playing a game no-one has any actual stake in, instead of being designed around users and then taking the time to make properly technical decisions.</p>
<h2 id="in-defense-of-novel-stacks">In defense of novel stacks</h2>
<p>Postgres, HTML and raw Javascript are not the best choices-touting them as the end-all be-all of pragmatism is reactionary at its core. Taking that logic to its extreme, we would still write FORTRAN on mainframes. Node.js was invented for a valid reason and has obviously led to an explosion of great software; so did react; microservices power some of the largest companies in the world. It&#39;s knowing and respecting and exploring and inventing and taking these alternatives seriously that allows one to decide that Postgres, HTML and raw Javascript are the better choices, sometimes.</p>
<p>XML in particular is a rich stack that is constantly being reinvented with each new serialization format (JSON has json-schema, JQ, some half-assed steaming parsers, JSON-LD, I could go on forever...). Similarly, you can&#39;t fault the Javascript ecosystem which overall is one of the most developer-centric ecosystems I know for the quirks of the Javascript language, because pretty much all technical decisions that were made, starting with Brendan Eich&#39;s decision to whip it out in a week, were defendable and competent decisions.</p>
<h2 id="just-have-fun-and-be-open">Just have fun and be open</h2>
<p>So please, developers, don&#39;t think that YAGNI and minimalism is somehow &#34;better&#34; or &#34;more competent&#34; than exploring and playing and building things like mongoDB or serverless or AI or typescript or rust or single-page applications.</p>
<p>Explore, build, use, reuse, contribute, rewrite, package, play with all these technologies, because that is how we actually make progress in our field and how one becomes a better engineer.</p>
