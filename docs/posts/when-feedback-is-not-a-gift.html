    <h1>When feedback is not a gift</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	  <p>While developing our book, reviewers periodically rated our book with a 5 star rating.</p>

<p>The feedback fell into 3 rough buckets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1-2 stars</strong>: this book was not for them. They should be discouraged from buying it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>3-4 stars</strong>: they got the vision of the book, but saw a better execution of the vision. They wanted to help us get there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>5 stars</strong>: so enthusiastic about the book they didn’t have any substantive feedback</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The most important group is the 3-4 Star people. We took their feedback seriously. They saw the best version the book could be, and they were on our team.</p>

<p>The 1-2 Star people didn’t get the book at all. They had a completely different outlook, even set of values, around the problem space. We needed to find a way to avoid them, not market to them, and/or simply better clarify the point of the book. We loved the 5 star folks, as they gave us energy to keep going, but usually they didn’t dig deep, with substantive, constructive criticism.</p>

<p>In work, we’re often told “feedback is a gift”. But the reality feedback is only a gift from the 3-4 star people. Those that get us, care about us, but see a better version of ourselves we can achieve.</p>

<p>How many people is that in life? That dig deep to give us thoughtful feedback? That can caringly give that feedback? Precious few.</p>

<p>When we’re told to uncritically accept feedback. That “feedback is a gift”, I feel queasy.</p>

<p>Internalizing feedback from the wrong sources can be very destructive. It can lead to a crisis of confidence. It can lead us to question our conviction. It can weaken our unique perspective, and water us down to a point of ineffectiveness. At its worst it can cause us to be gaslit by people who want to do us harm - sociopaths or narcisissts we need to get out of our lives.</p>

<p>We can’t get better without feedback. Accepting <em>no</em> feedback is as pathological as accepting <em>all</em> feedback. We should default to curiosity about all feedback, but also lean on our assertiveness to know where to draw the line.</p>

<p>Most dangerous is the feedback of the powerful. We default to taking that feedback especially to heart: they control our careers and even lives. How can we NOT accept that feedback? But here we are most vulnerable, and most easily manipulated.</p>

<p>Be careful. Set that boundary for yourself. Accepting and internalizing all feedback is a terribly dark road to manipulation and lost authenticity. Lean on curiosity, openness, but assertiveness. Say no, and don’t let yourself be manipulated by “feedback”.</p>
