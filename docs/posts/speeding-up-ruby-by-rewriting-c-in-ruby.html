    <h1>Speeding up Ruby by rewriting C in Ruby</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/98548/2024/yjitvsc.drawio.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>There is a recent <a href="https://github.com/bddicken/languages">language comparison repo</a> which has been getting shared a lot. In it, CRuby was the third slowest option, only beating out R and Python.</p>
<p>The repo author, <a href="https://x.com/BenjDicken">@BenjDicken</a>, <a href="https://x.com/BenjDicken/status/1861072804239847914">created a fun visualization</a> of each language‚Äôs performance. Here‚Äôs one of the visualizations, which shows Ruby as the third slowest language benchmarked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The code for this visualization is from <a href="https://benjdd.com/languages/">https://benjdd.com/languages/</a>, with permission from <a href="https://x.com/BenjDicken/status/1862623583803253149">@BenjDicken</a></p>

<p>The repository describes itself as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A repo for collaboratively building small benchmarks to compare languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It contains two different benchmarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>‚ÄúLoops‚Äù, which ‚ÄúEmphasizes loop, conditional, and basic math performance‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄúFibonacci‚Äù, which ‚ÄúEmphasizes function call overhead and recursion.‚Äù</li>
</ol>
<p>The loop example iterates 1 billion times, utilizing a nested loop:</p>

<p>Run on <a href="https://x.com/BenjDicken">@BenjDicken</a>‚Äôs M3 MacBook Pro, Ruby 3.3.6 takes 28 seconds to run the loop iteration example, and 12 seconds to run the Fibonacci example. For comparison, node.js takes a little over a second for both examples - it‚Äôs not a great showing for Ruby.</p>

<p>From this point on, I‚Äôll use benchmarks relative to my own computer. Running the same benchmark on my M2 MacBook Air, I get 33.43 seconds for the loops and 16.33 seconds for fibonacci - even worse ü•∫. Node runs a little over 1 second for fibonacci and 2 seconds for the loop example.</p>

<h3 id="who-cares">Who cares?</h3>
<p>In most ways, these types of benchmarks are meaningless. Python was the slowest language in the benchmark, and yet at the same time it‚Äôs the <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/">most used language on Github as of October 2024</a>. Ruby runs some of the <a href="https://x.com/tobi/status/1863935229620363693">largest web apps in the world</a>. I ran a <a href="https://x.com/jpcamara/status/1849984009515966958">benchmark recently of websocket performance between the Ruby Falcon web server and node.js</a>, and the Ruby results were close to the node.js results. Are you doing a billion loop iterations or using web sockets?</p>
<p>A programming language should be reasonably efficient - after that the usefulness of the language, the type of tasks you work on, and language productivity outweigh the speed at which you can run a billion iterations of a loop, or complete an intentionally inefficient implementation of a Fibonacci method.</p>
<p>That said:</p>
<ol>
<li>The programming world loves microbenchmarks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
<li>Having a fast benchmark may not be valuable in practice but it has meaning for people‚Äôs interest in a language. Some would claim it means you‚Äôll have an easier time scaling performance, but that‚Äôs arguable<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
<li>It‚Äôs disappointing if your language of choice doesn‚Äôt perform well. It‚Äôs nice to be able to say ‚ÄúI use and enjoy this language, and it runs fast in all benchmarks!‚Äù</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of this Ruby benchmark, I had a feeling that YJIT wasn‚Äôt being applied in the Ruby code, so I checked the repo. Lo and behold, the command was as follows:</p>
<pre><code>ruby ./code.rb 40
</code></pre>
<p>We know my results from earlier (33 seconds and 16 seconds). What do we get with YJIT applied?</p>
<pre><code>ruby --yjit ./code.rb 40
</code></pre>

<p>Nice! With YJIT, Fibonacci gets a massive boost - going from 16.88 seconds down to 2.06 seconds. It‚Äôs close to the speed of node.js at that point!</p>
<p>YJIT makes a more modest difference for the looping example - going from 33.43 seconds down to 25.57 seconds. Why is that?</p>
<h3 id="a-team-effort">A team effort</h3>
<p>I wasn‚Äôt alone in trying out these code samples with YJIT. On twitter, <a href="https://x.com/bsilva96">@bsilva96</a> had asked the same questions:</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs unpack his response. There are three parts to it:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Range#each</code> is still written in C as of Ruby 3.4</li>
<li><code>Integer#times</code> was converted from C to Ruby in Ruby 3.3</li>
<li><code>Array#each</code> was converted from C to Ruby in Ruby 3.4</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-rangeeach-is-still-written-in-c-which-yjit-cant-optimize">1. <code>Range#each</code> is still written in C, which YJIT can‚Äôt optimize</h3>
<p>Looking back at our Ruby code:</p>
<pre><code>(0...10_000).each do |i|                     
  (0...100_000).each do |j|               
    a[i] += j % u                     
  end
  a[i] += r                      
end
</code></pre>
<p>It‚Äôs written as a range, and range has its own <code>each</code> implementation, which is apparently written in C. The CRuby codebase is pretty easy to navigate - let‚Äôs find that implementation üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
<p>Most core classes in Ruby have top-level C files named after them - in this case we‚Äôve got <code>range.c</code> at the root of the project. CRuby has a pretty readable interface for exposing C functions as classes and methods - there is an <code>Init</code> function, usually at the bottom of the file. Inside that <code>Init</code> our classes, modules and methods are exposed from C to Ruby. Here are the relevant pieces of <code>Init_Range</code>:</p>
<pre><code>void
Init_Range(void)
{
  //...
  rb_cRange = rb_struct_define_without_accessor(
    &#34;Range&#34;, rb_cObject, range_alloc,
    &#34;begin&#34;, &#34;end&#34;, &#34;excl&#34;, NULL);

  rb_include_module(rb_cRange, rb_mEnumerable);
  // ...
  rb_define_method(rb_cRange, &#34;each&#34;, range_each, 0);
</code></pre>
<p>First, we define our <code>Range</code> class using <code>rb_struct_define...</code>. We name it <code>‚ÄúRange‚Äù</code>, with a super class of <code>Object</code> (<code>rb_cObject</code>), and some initialization parameters (<code>‚Äúbegin‚Äù</code>, <code>‚Äúend‚Äù</code> and whether to exclude the last value, ie the <code>..</code> vs <code>...</code> range syntax).</p>
<p>Second, we include <code>Enumerable</code> using <code>rb_include_module</code>. That gives us all the great Ruby enumeration methods like <code>map</code>, <code>select</code>, <code>include?</code> and <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.3/Enumerable.html">a bajillion others</a>. All you have to do is provide an <code>each</code> implementation and it handles the rest.</p>
<p>Third, we define our <code>‚Äúeach‚Äù</code> method. It‚Äôs implemented by the <code>range_each</code> function in C, and takes zero explicit arguments (blocks are not considered in this count).</p>
<p><code>range_each</code> is hefty. It‚Äôs almost 100 lines long, and specializes into several versions of itself. I‚Äôll highlight a few, collapsed all together:</p>
<pre><code>static VALUE
range_each(VALUE range)
{
  //...
  range_each_fixnum_endless(beg);
  range_each_fixnum_loop(beg, end, range);
  range_each_bignum_endless(beg);
  rb_str_upto_endless_each(beg, sym_each_i, 0);
  // and even more...
</code></pre>
<p>These C functions handle all the variations of ranges you might use in your own code:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby">(<span>0</span><span>...</span>)<span>.</span>each
(<span>0</span><span>...</span><span>100</span>)<span>.</span>each
(<span>&#34;a&#34;</span><span>...</span><span>&#34;z&#34;</span>)<span>.</span>each
<span># and on...</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Why does it matter that <code>Range#each</code> is written in C? It means YJIT can‚Äôt inspect it - optimizations stop at the function call and resume when the function call returns. C functions are fast, but YJIT can take things further by creating specializations for hot paths of code. There is a great article from Aaron Patterson called <a href="https://railsatscale.com/2023-08-29-ruby-outperforms-c/">Ruby Outperforms C</a> where you can learn more about some of those specialized optimizations.</p>
<h3 id="2-optimizing-our-loop-integertimes-was-converted-from-c-to-ruby-in-ruby-33">2. Optimizing our loop: <code>Integer#times</code> was converted from C to Ruby in Ruby 3.3</h3>
<p>The hot path (<em>where most of our CPU time is spent</em>) is <code>Range#each</code>, which is a C function. YJIT can‚Äôt optimize C functions - they‚Äôre a black box. So what can we do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We converted Integer#times to Ruby in 3.3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting! In Ruby 3.3, <code>Integer#times</code> was <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/8388">converted from a C function to a Ruby method</a>! Here‚Äôs the 3.3+ version - its pretty simple:</p>
<pre><code>def times
  #... a little C interop code
  i = 0
  while i &lt; self
    yield i
    i = i.succ
  end
  self
end
</code></pre>
<p>Very simple. It‚Äôs just a basic while loop. Most importantly, it‚Äôs all Ruby code, which means YJIT should be able to introspect and optimize it!</p>
<h3 id="an-aside-on-integersucc">An aside on <code>Integer#succ</code></h3>
<p>The slightly odd part of that code is <code>i.succ</code>. I‚Äôd never heard of <code>Integer#succ</code>, which apparently gives you the ‚Äúsuccessor‚Äù to an integer.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/98548/2024/0c8bd56f64.png" alt=""/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve never seen this show, and yet it‚Äôs the first thing I thought of when I learned about this method. Thanks, advertising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a PR to improve the performance of <code>Integer#succ</code> in early 2024, which helped me understand why anyone would ever use it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We use Integer#succ when we rewrite loop methods in Ruby (e.g. Integer#times and Array#each) because opt_succ (i = i.succ) is faster to dispatch on the interpreter than putobject 1; opt_plus (i += 1).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/9519">https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/9519</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>Integer#succ</code> is like a virtual machine cheat code. It takes a common operation (adding 1 to an integer) and turns it from two virtual machine operations into one. We can call <code>disasm</code> on the <code>times</code> method to see that in action:</p>
<pre><code>puts RubyVM::InstructionSequence.disasm(1.method(:times))
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Integer#times</code> method gets broken down into a lot of Ruby VM bytecode, but we only care about a few lines:</p>
<pre><code>...
0025 getlocal_WC_0   i@0
0027 opt_succ        &lt;calldata!mid:succ, ARGS_SIMPLE&gt;[CcCr]
0029 setlocal_WC_0   i@0
...
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>getlocal_WC_0</code> gets our <code>i</code> variable from the current scope. That‚Äôs the <code>i</code> in <code>i.succ</code></li>
<li><code>opt_succ</code> performs the <code>succ</code> call in our <code>i.succ</code>. It will either call the actual <code>Integer#succ</code> method, or an optimized C function for small numbers</li>
<li>In Ruby 3.4 with YJIT enabled, small numbers get optimized even further into machine code (just a note, not shown in the VM machine code)</li>
<li><code>setlocal_WC_0</code> sets the result of <code>opt_succ</code> to our local variable <code>i</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If we change from <code>i = i.succ</code> to <code>i += 1</code>, we now have two VM operations take the place of <code>opt_succ</code>:</p>
<pre><code>...
0025 getlocal_WC_0        i@0
0027 putobject_INT2FIX_1_
0028 opt_plus             &lt;calldata!mid:+, argc:1, ARGS_SIMPLE&gt;
0029 setlocal_WC_0        i@0
...
</code></pre>
<p>Everything is essentially the same as before, except now we have two steps to go through instead of one:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>putobject_INT2FIX_1_</code> pushes the integer <code>1</code> onto the virtual machine stack</li>
<li><code>opt_plus</code> is the <code>+</code> in our <code>+= 1</code>, and calls either the Ruby <code>+</code> method or an optimized C function for small numbers</li>
<li>There is probably a YJIT optimization for <code>opt_plus</code> as well</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is nothing else to learn from this code, it‚Äôs this: the kinds of optimizations you do at the VM and JIT level are <em>deep</em>. When writing general Ruby programs we typically don‚Äôt and <em>shouldn‚Äôt</em> consider the impact of one versus two <em>machine code instructions</em>. But at the JIT level, on the scale of millions and billions of operations, it matters!</p>
<h3 id="back-to-integertimes">Back to <code>Integer#times</code></h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs try running our benchmark code again, using <code>times</code>! Instead of iterating over ranges, we simply iterate for <code>10_000</code> and <code>100_000</code> <code>times</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby">u <span>=</span> <span>ARGV</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span>to_i

<p>Nice! YJIT makes a much larger impact using <code>Integer#times</code>. That trims things down significantly, taking it down to 13.66 seconds on my machine. On <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/k0kubun.com">@k0kobun</a>‚Äôs machine it actually goes down to 9 seconds (and 8 seconds on Ruby 3.4).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs probably Ruby 3.5‚Äôs job to make it faster than 8s though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We might look forward to even faster performance in Ruby 3.5. We‚Äôll see!</p>
<h3 id="3-arrayeach-was-converted-from-c-to-ruby-in-ruby-34">3. <code>Array#each</code> was converted from C to Ruby in Ruby 3.4</h3>
<p>CRuby continues to see C code rewritten in Ruby, and in Ruby 3.4 <code>Array#each</code> was one of those changes. Here is an <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/6687/files">example of the first attempt at implementing it</a>:</p>
<pre><code>def each
  unless block_given?
    return to_enum(:each) { self.length }
  end
  i = 0
  while i &lt; self.length
    yield self[i]
    i = i.succ
  end
  self
end
</code></pre>
<p>Super simple and readable! And YJIT optimizable!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to something related to CRuby internals, it contained <a href="https://jpcamara.com/2024/06/23/your-ruby-programs.html#race-conditions">race conditions</a>. A later implementation <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/11955">landed in Ruby 3.4</a>.</p>
<pre><code>def each
  Primitive.attr! :inline_block, :c_trace

  unless defined?(yield)
    return Primitive.cexpr! &#39;SIZED_ENUMERATOR(self, 0, 0, ary_enum_length)&#39;
  end
  _i = 0
  value = nil
  while Primitive.cexpr!(%q{ ary_fetch_next(self, LOCAL_PTR(_i), LOCAL_PTR(value)) })
    yield value
  end
  self
end
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike the first implementation, and unlike <code>Integer#times</code>, things are a bit more cryptic this time. This is definitely not pure Ruby code that anyone could be expected to write. Somehow, the <code>Primitive</code> module seems to allow evaluating C code from Ruby, and in doing so avoids the race conditions present in the pure Ruby solution<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>By fetching indexes and values using C code, I think it results in a more atomic operation. I have no idea why the <code>Primitive.cexpr!</code> is used to return the enumerator, or what value <code>Primitive.attr! :inline_block</code> provides. Please comment if you have insights there!</p>
<p>I was a little loose with my earlier <code>Integer#times</code> source code as well. That actually had a bit of this <code>Primitive</code> syntax as well. The core of the method is what we looked at, and it‚Äôs all Ruby, but the start of the method contains the same <code>Primitive</code> calls for <code>:inline_block</code> and returning the enumerator:</p>
<pre><code>def times
  Primitive.attr! :inline_block
  unless defined?(yield)
    return Primitive.cexpr! &#39;SIZED_ENUMERATOR(self, 0, 0, int_dotimes_size)&#39;
  end
  #...
</code></pre>
<p>Ok - it‚Äôs more cryptic than <code>Integer#times</code> was, but <code>Array#each</code> is mostly Ruby (on Ruby 3.4+). Let‚Äôs give it a try using arrays instead of ranges or <code>times</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby">u <span>=</span> <span>ARGV</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span>to_i

<span>end</span>
	
puts a<span>[</span>r<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Despite the embedded C code, YJIT still seems capable of making some hefty performance optimizations. It‚Äôs within the same range as <code>Integer#times</code>!</p>

<p>I have no idea why the <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loop examples I wrote seem to be so slow. I‚Äôd expect them to run much faster. Maybe there‚Äôs an issue with how I wrote them - feel free to open an issue or PR if you see something wrong with my implementation. The <code>loop do</code> (taken from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/timtilberg.bsky.social">@timtilberg</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://x.com/timtilberg/status/1861194052516864004">example</a>) runs around the same speed as <code>Integer#times</code> - although its performance is <em>awful</em> with YJIT turned off.</p>
<p>In addition to running Ruby 3.4, for fun I have it using <code>rbenv</code> to run:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby 3.3</li>
<li>Ruby 3.3 YJIT</li>
<li>Ruby 3.2</li>
<li>Ruby 3.2 YJIT</li>

<p>Based on that, I‚Äôve taken the original visualization and made a Ruby specific one here just for the <code>fibonacci</code> run:</p>

<h3 id="speeding-up-rangeeach">Speeding up <code>range#each</code></h3>
<p>Can we, the non <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/k0kubun.com">@k0kobun</a>‚Äôs of the world, make <code>range#each</code> faster? If I monkey patch the <code>Range</code> class with a pure-ruby implementation, things <em>do</em> get much faster! Here‚Äôs my implementation:</p>
<pre><code>class Range
  def each
    beginning = self.begin
    ending = self.end
    i = beginning
    loop do
      break if i == ending
      yield i
      i = i.succ
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>And here is the change in performance - 2 seconds slower than <code>times</code> - not bad!</p>

<p>This is obviously over-simplified. I don‚Äôt handle all of the different cases of <code>Range</code>, and there may be nuances I am missing. Also, most of the Ruby rewritten methods I‚Äôve seen invoke a <code>Primitive</code> class for certain operations. I‚Äôd love to learn more about when and why it‚Äôs needed.</p>
<p>But! It goes to show the power of moving things <em>out</em> of C and letting YJIT optimize our code. It can improve performance in ways that would be difficult or impossible to replicate in regular C code.</p>
<h3 id="yjit-standard-library">YJIT standard library</h3>
<p>Last year Aaron Patterson wrote an article called <a href="https://railsatscale.com/2023-08-29-ruby-outperforms-c/">Ruby Outperforms C</a>, in which he rewrote a C extension in Ruby for some GraphQL parsing. The Ruby code outperformed C thanks to YJIT optimizations.</p>
<p>This got me thinking that it would be interesting to see a kind of ‚ÄúYJIT standard library‚Äù emerge, where core ruby functionality run in C could be swapped out for Ruby implementations for use by people using YJIT.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this is almost exactly what the core YJIT team has been doing. In many cases they‚Äôve completely removed C code, but more recently they‚Äôve created a <code>with_yjit</code> block. The code will only take effect if YJIT is enabled, and otherwise the C code will run. For example, this is how<code>Array#each</code> is implemented:</p>
<pre><code>with_yjit do
  if Primitive.rb_builtin_basic_definition_p(:each)
    undef :each

    def each # :nodoc:
      # ... we examined this code earlier ...
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>As of Ruby 3.3, YJIT can be lazily initialized. Thankfully the <code>with_yjit</code> code handles this - the appropriate <code>with_yjit</code> versions of methods will be run once YJIT is enabled:</p>
<pre><code># Uses C-builtin
[1, 2, 3].each do |i|
  puts i
end

RubyVM::YJIT.enable

# Uses Ruby version, which can be YJIT optimized
[1, 2, 3].each do |i|
  puts i
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is because <code>with_yjit</code> is a YJIT ‚Äúhook‚Äù, which is called the moment YJIT is enabled. After being called, it is removed from the runtime using <code>undef :with_yjit</code>.</p>
<h3 id="investigating-yjit-optimizations">Investigating YJIT optimizations</h3>
<p>We‚Äôve looked at Ruby code. We‚Äôve looked at C code. We‚Äôve looked at Ruby VM bytecode. Why not take it one step deeper and look at some <em>machine code</em>? And maybe some Rust code? Hey - where are you going! Don‚Äôt walk away while I‚Äôm talking to you!</p>
<p>If you <em>haven‚Äôt</em> walked away, or skipped to the next section, let‚Äôs take a look at a small sliver of YJIT while we‚Äôre here!</p>
<p>We can see the machine code YJIT generates üò±. It‚Äôs possible by building CRuby from source with YJIT debug flags. If you‚Äôre on a Mac you can see <a href="https://jpcamara.com/2024/12/02/my-macos-setup.html">my MacOS setup for hacking on CRuby</a> or <a href="https://jpcamara.com/2024/11/27/my-docker-setup.html">my docker setup for hacking on CRuby</a> for more elaborate instructions on building Ruby. But the simplified step is when you go to <code>./configure</code> Ruby, you hand in an option of <code>--enable-yjit=dev</code>:</p>
<pre><code>./configure --enable-yjit=dev
make install
</code></pre>
<p>Let‚Äôs use our <code>Integer#times</code> example from earlier as our example Ruby code:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby">u <span>=</span> <span>ARGV</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span>to_i
r <span>=</span> rand(<span>10_000</span>)
a <span>=</span> Array<span>.</span>new(<span>10_000</span>, <span>0</span>)
	
<span>10_000</span><span>.</span>times <span>do</span> <span>|</span>i<span>|</span>
  <span>100_000</span><span>.</span>times <span>do</span> <span>|</span>j<span>|</span>
    a<span>[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>+=</span> j <span>%</span> u
  <span>end</span>
  a<span>[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>+=</span> r
<span>end</span>
	
puts a<span>[</span>r<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Because you‚Äôve built Ruby with YJIT in dev mode, you can hand in the <code>--yjit-dump-disasm</code> flag when running your ruby program:</p>
<pre><code>./ruby --yjit --yjit-dump-disasm test.rb 40
</code></pre>
<p>Using this, we can see the machine code created. We‚Äôll just focus in on one tiny part - the machine code equivalent of the Ruby VM bytecode we read earlier. Here is the original VM bytecode for <code>opt_succ</code>, which is generated when you call <code>i.succ</code>, the <code>Integer#succ</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>...
0027 opt_succ        &lt;calldata!mid:succ, ARGS_SIMPLE&gt;[CcCr]
...
</code></pre>
<p>And here is the machine code YJIT generates in this scenario, on my Mac M2 arm64 architecture:</p>
<pre><code># Block: times@&lt;internal:numeric&gt;:259 
# reg_mapping: [Some(Stack(0)), None, None, None, None]
# Insn: 0027 opt_succ (stack_size: 1)
# call to Integer#succ
# guard object is fixnum
0x1096808c4: tst x1, #1
0x1096808c8: b.eq #0x109683014
0x1096808cc: nop 
0x1096808d0: nop 
0x1096808d4: nop 
0x1096808d8: nop 
0x1096808dc: nop 
# Integer#succ
0x1096808e0: adds x11, x1, #2
0x1096808e4: b.vs #0x109683048
0x1096808e8: mov x1, x11
</code></pre>
<p>To be honest, I about 25% understand this, and 75% am combining my own logic and AI to learn it ü§´. Feel free to yell at me if I get it a little wrong, I‚Äôd love to learn more. But here‚Äôs how I break this down.</p>
<pre><code># Block: times@&lt;internal:numeric&gt;:259
</code></pre>
<p>üëÜüèºThis roughly corresponds to the line <code>i = i.succ</code> in the <code>Integer#times</code> method in <code>numeric.rb</code>. I say roughly because in my current code I see that on line 258, but maybe it shows the end of the block it‚Äôs run in since YJIT compiles ‚Äúblocks‚Äù of code:</p>
<pre><code>256: while i &lt; self
257:   yield i
258:   i = i.succ
259: end

# reg_mapping: [Some(Stack(0)), None, None, None, None]
# Insn: 0027 opt_succ (stack_size: 1)
# call to Integer#succ
</code></pre>
<p>üëÜüèºI have no idea what <code>reg_mapping</code> means - probably mapping how it uses a CPU register? <code>Insn: 0027 opt_succ</code> looks very familiar! That‚Äôs our VM bytecode! <code>call to Integer#succ</code> is just a helpful comment added. YJIT is capable of adding comments to the machine code. We still haven‚Äôt even left the safety of the comments üòÖ.</p>
<pre><code># guard object is fixnum
</code></pre>
<p>üëÜüèºThis is interesting. I can find a corresponding bit of Rust code that maps directly to this. Let‚Äôs take a look at it:</p>
<pre><code>fn jit_rb_int_succ(
  //...
  asm: &amp;mut Assembler,
  //...
) -&gt; bool {
  // Guard the receiver is fixnum
  let recv_type = asm.ctx.get_opnd_type(StackOpnd(0));
  let recv = asm.stack_pop(1);
  if recv_type != Type::Fixnum {
    asm_comment!(asm, &#34;guard object is fixnum&#34;);
    asm.test(recv, Opnd::Imm(RUBY_FIXNUM_FLAG as i64));
         asm.jz(Target::side_exit(Counter::opt_succ_not_fixnum));
  }

  asm_comment!(asm, &#34;Integer#succ&#34;);
  let out_val = asm.add(recv, Opnd::Imm(2)); // 2 is untagged Fixnum 1
  asm.jo(Target::side_exit(Counter::opt_succ_overflow));

  // Push the output onto the stack
  let dst = asm.stack_push(Type::Fixnum);
  asm.mov(dst, out_val);

  true
}
</code></pre>
<p>Oh nice! This is the actual YJIT Rust implementation of the <code>opt_succ</code> call. This is that optimization <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/k0kubun.com">@k0kobun</a> made to further improve <code>opt_succ</code> performance beyond the bytecode C function calls. We‚Äôre in the section that is checking if what we‚Äôre operating on is a Fixnum, which is a way small integers are stored internally in CRuby:</p>
<pre><code>if recv_type != TypeFixnum 
  asm_comment!(asm, &#34;guard object is fixnum&#34;);
  asm.test(recv, Opnd::Imm(RUBY_FIXNUM_FLAG as i64));
  asm.jz(Target::side_exit(Counter::opt_succ_not_fixnum));
}
</code></pre>
<p>That becomes this machine code:</p>
<pre><code># guard object is fixnum
0x1096808c4: tst x1, #1
0x1096808c8: b.eq #0x109683014
</code></pre>
<p><code>asm.test</code> generates <code>tst x1, #1</code>, which according to an AI bot I asked is checking the least significant bit, which is a Fixnum ‚Äútag‚Äù that indicates this is a Fixnum. If it‚Äôs Fixnum, the result is 1 and <code>b.eq</code> is false. If it‚Äôs not a Fixnum, the result is <code>0</code> and <code>b.eq</code> is true and jumps away from this code.</p>
<pre><code>0x1096808cc: nop 
0x1096808d0: nop 
0x1096808d4: nop 
0x1096808d8: nop 
0x1096808dc: nop 
</code></pre>
<p>ü§ñ ‚ÄúNOPs for alignment/padding‚Äù. Thanks AI. I don‚Äôt know why it is needed, but at least I know what it probably is.</p>
<p>Finally, we <em>actually</em> add 1 to the number.</p>
<pre><code>asm_comment!(asm, &#34;Integer#succ&#34;);
let out_val = asm.add(recv, Opnd::Imm(2)); // 2 is untagged Fixnum 1
asm.jo(Target::side_exit(Counter::opt_succ_overflow));

// Push the output onto the stack
let dst = asm.stack_push(Type::Fixnum);
asm.mov(dst, out_val);
</code></pre>
<p>The Rust code generates our <code>Integer#succ</code> comment. Then, to add 1, because of the ‚ÄúFixnum tag‚Äù data embedded within our integer, actually means we have to add 2 using <code>adds x11, x1, #2</code> üòµ‚Äçüí´. If we overflow the space available, it exits to a different code path - <code>b.vs</code> is a branch on overflow. Otherwise, it stores the result with <code>mov x1, x11</code>!</p>
<pre><code># Integer#succ
0x1096808e0: adds x11, x1, #2
0x1096808e4: b.vs #0x109683048
0x1096808e8: mov x1, x11
</code></pre>
<p>üòÆ‚Äçüí®. That was a lot. And it seems like <em>alot</em> of working is being done, but because it‚Äôs such low level machine code it‚Äôs presumably super fast. We examined a teensy tiny portion of what YJIT is capable of generating - JITs are complicated!</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/k0kubun.com">@k0kobun</a> for providing me with the commands and pointing me at the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/doc/yjit/yjit.md">YJIT docs</a> which contain tons of additional options as well.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-of-cruby-optimizations">The future of CRuby optimizations</h3>
<p>The irony of language implementation is that you often work less in the language you‚Äôre implementing than you do in something lower-level - in Ruby‚Äôs case, that‚Äôs mostly C and some Rust.</p>
<p>With a layer like YJIT, it potentially opens up a future where more of the language becomes plain Ruby, and Ruby developer contribution is easier. Many languages have a smaller low level core, and the majority of the language is written in itself (like Java, for instance). Maybe that‚Äôs a future for CRuby, someday! Until then, keep the YJIT optimizations coming, YJIT team!</p>
