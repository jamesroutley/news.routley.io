            <div><p>Turn on communication safety to help protect your child from viewing or sharing photos that contain nudity in the Messages app. If Messages detects that a child receives or is attempting to send this type of photo, Messages blurs the photo before it’s viewed on your child’s device and provides guidance and age-appropriate resources to help them make a safe choice, including contacting someone they trust if they choose. </p>
<p><span><em>The communication safety feature requires iOS 15.2 or later, iPadOS 15.2 or later, or macOS Monterey 12.1 or later, and is available to child accounts signed in with their Apple ID and part of a Family Sharing group. This feature is off by default. </em></span></p>

            <div><p>You can turn on communication safety at any time in Screen Time settings for your child’s account.  <br/>
</p>
<ol>
<li>On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, go to Settings &gt; Screen Time. On a Mac, choose Apple menu &gt; System Preferences, then click Screen Time. (If you haven’t already turned on Screen Time, <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201304">use parental controls to turn it on</a>.)</li>
<li>Tap the name of a child in your family group. </li>
<li>Then tap Communication Safety, and tap Continue. </li>
<li>Turn on Check for Sensitive Photos. You may need to enter the Screen Time passcode for the device.</li>

            <h2>If Messages detects an image that appears to contain nudity</h2>
            <p>If Messages determines that a photo your child has received or is about to send appears to contain nudity, it blurs the image, displays a warning that the photo may be sensitive, and offers ways to get help. </p>
            
                
    
        <div>
    

    
            <h3>Ways to get help</h3>
            <div><p>Messages offers the child several ways to get help—including leaving the conversation, blocking the contact, leaving a group message, and accessing online safety resources—and reassures the child that it’s okay if they don’t want to view the photo or continue the conversation. </p>

            <div><p>As an additional precaution, the child has the option to message an adult that they trust about the photo. If the child is under 13, Messages prompts the child to start a conversation with their parent or guardians.</p>
