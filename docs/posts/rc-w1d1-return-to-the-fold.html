      <div><p>I&#39;m back at RC (or perhaps, <a href="https://ezzeriesa.notion.site/Rewriting-my-toy-blockchain-in-Rust-9a130f225666488491ba497004821fbb">non-mini</a> RC). The plan is to write every day.</p><p>I enjoyed <a href="https://ezzeriesa.notion.site/1-week-with-David-Beazley-and-SICP-4c440389cf1e43f48fe67c969967f655">SICP</a>. I wanted to go deeper. Partly for missing out the first time I did RC. Partly due to having worked on infrastructure for the past 2 years and wondering, is there more to life than making things run at scale?</p><p>Like the first time I did RC, I&#39;m working through Brent Yorgey&#39;s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/">CIS 194</a>. At times I feel going into Haskell is escapism. Let&#39;s stick to it for a week and see where this goes.</p></div>
