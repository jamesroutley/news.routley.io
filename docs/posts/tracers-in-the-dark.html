<p>In <em>Tracers in the Dark</em>, Andy Greenberg traces the fascinating, horrifying, and complicated story of the battle over Bitcoin secrecy, as law enforcement agencies, tax authorities and private-sector sleuths seek to trace and attribute the cryptocurrency used in a variety of crimes, some relatively benign (selling weed online), some absolutely ghastly (selling videos of child sex abuse).</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like an essay-formatted version of this thread to read or share, here&#39;s a link to it on pluralistic.net, my surveillance-free, ad-free, tracker-free blog:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/15/public-immutable-crimes/#andy-greenberg">https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/15/public-immutable-crimes/#andy-greenberg</a></p>
<p>Bitcoin&#39;s early boosters touted its privacy protections as a game-changer, a way for people to exchange money with one another without anyone else being able to know about it. But the reality is a lot more complex. In a very important way, Bitcoin is the opposite of private: every transaction is indelibly inscribed upon the blockchain, linked to a pseudonymous identifier.</p>
<p>In theory, if you are careful about not linking a wallet address to your real identity, then your transactions are not traceable to you.</p>
<p>In practice, this is really, really, really hard.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to slip up and expose your identity, and even if you maintain perfect operational security, <em>other</em> people might slip up and do it for you. This is a lesson that many cryptocurrency users learned the hard way, as Greenberg documents.</p>
<p>The de-anonymizers who sought to expose Bitcoin transactions had a major advantage: <em>users</em> of Bitcoin believed the hype and really thought that the blockchain provided them with a powerful – even invulnerable – degree of anonymity. They used cryptos to buy and sell a lot of illegal things, from fentanyl to murder for hire, over long timescales. That meant that they attracted the attention of law-enforcement agencies, who were able to use the eternal, indelible blockchain to backtrack their subjects&#39; every transaction to the very first days of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Like Greenberg&#39;s previous book, <em>Sandworm</em> (a history of Russian state-backed malware operations in Ukraine), <em>Tracers</em> uses current events to conduct a master-class in the art and science of digital forensics, laying out the tactics and countertactics of a specific kind of cyberwarfare:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2019-11-01/sandworm-andy-greenberg-cybersecurity">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2019-11-01/sandworm-andy-greenberg-cybersecurity</a></p>
<p>Starting with the notorious Silk Road takedown, and moving through other &#34;dark market&#34; seizures like AlphaBay, Greenberg draws on incredible first-person accounts, digital forensics, court documents and well-placed sources to spin out a tense, exciting technothriller. We meet dirty cops, snake-eyed drug-lords, and brilliant technologists and researchers who find devilishly creative strategies to hide or uncover.</p>
<p>Greenberg also provides a rare and non-sensationalistic deep dive into the unthinkable world of child sexual abuse material marketplaces. These are the darkest corners of the human psyche and the digital world, and Greenberg&#39;s tick-tock depiction of the seizure of &#34;Welcome to Video,&#34; the largest such market ever, is chilling.</p>
<p>In the final section of the book, Greenberg considers the geopolitics of secret money. We hear a little (too little, honestly) from people presenting the human rights case for financial privacy. This is a complex issue and I&#39;m deeply ambivalent about it myself, but it&#39;s a subject worthy of its own book. This cursory treatment of human rights and finance is an inevitable artifact of the book&#39;s structure: if you chronicle the adventures of cops hunting criminals, you won&#39;t encounter the stories of oppressed people hiding from authoritarians.</p>
<p>But when it comes to other geopolitical questions – like the role of crypto in fueling state-backed ransomware from North Korea – Greenberg has a front-row seat, and his account of this aspect is top-notch.</p>
<p>Greenberg also gives some space to the claims of developers of more privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash, airing credible accounts of how these might correct the defects in Bitcoin&#39;s privacy model – and credible critiques arguing that they, too, will fall before forensic investigators&#39; creative tactics.</p>
<p>Above all, this is a book about the attacker&#39;s advantage, the idea that defenders win by making no mistakes, while attackers need only find one single exploitable lapse to attain victory. Greenberg&#39;s account of the move/countermove dynamic of criminals and investigators are perfect illustrations of this phenomenon. The attackers – feds of various description – have many advantages, but above all, they are blessed not having to be perfect. They make all kinds of errors, and <em>it doesn&#39;t matter</em>, because no one is hunting them. Meanwhile, their quarry – largely unsympathetic criminals destroying their victims&#39; lives without a shred of empathy – are haunted by minuscule errors in the distant past.</p>
<p>The attacker&#39;s advantage, combined with the blockchain&#39;s eternal and indelible memory, constitute a powerful argument against the possibility of using blockchains to attain financial privacy. We all slip up. The reason the feds catch their prey isn&#39;t that they&#39;re smarter – it&#39;s that <em>they don&#39;t have to be</em>. The feds don&#39;t permanently inscribe their every error on an indelible public ledger. The defenders have <em>chosen</em> a defense that involves this tactic. They have, in other words, chosen a system of privacy for the infallible – a category that effectively doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p>This makes for a pretty devastating critique of public ledgers as a tool of privacy. And also, you know, a cracking technothriller.</p>
