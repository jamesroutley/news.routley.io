        <p>There was a spike in Explorer crashes that resulted in the instruction pointer out in the middle of nowhere.</p>

7077c100 ??              ???
</pre>
<p>Maybe the return address tells us something.</p>
<pre>0:000&gt; u poi esp
008bf6d4 test    eax,eax
008bf6d6 je      008bf6b9
008bf6d8 xor     edi,edi
008bf6da cmp     dword ptr [esi+430h],edi
</pre>
<p>It’s strange that we’re executing from someplace that has no name. If you look closely, you’ll see that we are executing code <i>from the stack</i>: <code>esp</code> is <code>008bf664</code>, so the code that went haywire is on the stack.</p>
<p>Who executes code from the stack?</p>
<p>Malware, that’s who.</p>
<p>Let’s see what this malware is trying to do.</p>
<p>Disassembling around the last known good code address gives us this:</p>
<pre>008bf6c4 call    dword ptr [esi+214h]
008bf6ca inc     dword ptr [ebp+8]
008bf6cd push    edi
008bf6ce call    dword ptr [esi+210h]   ; this called into space
008bf6d4 test    eax,eax
008bf6d6 je      008bf6b9
008bf6d8 xor     edi,edi
008bf6da cmp     dword ptr [esi+430h],edi
008bf6e0 je      008bf70d
</pre>
<p>It looks like the payload stored function pointers at <code>esi+210</code> and <code>esi+214</code>. Let’s see what’s there. This is probably where the payload stashed all its call targets.</p>
<pre>0:000&gt; dps @esi+200
008bf880  1475ff71
008bf884  00000004

008bf8b0  006f0072
008bf8b4  00720067
008bf8b8  006d0061
</pre>
<p>Yup, there’s a payload of function pointers here. It looks like this malware is going to wait for something, and then exit the process, or remove a directory, or exit Windows. Those bytes after <code>user32!ExitWindowsEx</code> look like a Unicode string, so let’s dump them as a string:</p>
<pre>0:000&gt; du 008bf8a8  
008bf8a8  &#34;C:\Program Files\Contoso\contoso_update.exe&#34;
</pre>
<p>Wait, what? It is trying to mess around with Contoso’s auto-updater?</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at more of the malware payload. Maybe we can figure out what it’s doing. It looks like it’s using <code>esi</code> as its base of operations, so let’s disassemble from <code>esi</code>.</p>

<p>Aha, this isn’t malware. This is an uninstaller!</p>
<p>The mystery function is almost certainly <code>DeleteFileW</code>. It’s waiting for the main uninstaller to exit, so it can delete the binary.</p>
<p>There is a page on CodeProject that shows how to write a self-deleting file, and it seems that multiple companies have decided to use that code to implement their own uninstallers. (Whether they follow the licensing terms for that code I do not know.)</p>
<p>Okay, so why did we crash? What went wrong with <code>DeleteFileW</code>?</p>
<p>According to the dump file, the spot where <code>DeleteFileW</code> was supposed to be instead holds <code>7077c100</code>. This is a function pointer into some mystery DLL that isn’t loaded. How did that happen?</p>
<p>My guess is that the <code>DeleteFileW</code> function was detoured in the Contoso uninstaller. When the uninstaller tried to built its table of useful functions, it ended up getting not the address of <code>DeleteFileW</code> but the address of a detour. It then tried to call that detour from its payload, but since the detour is not installed in Explorer (or if it is, the detour is in some other location), it ended up calling into space.</p>
<p>Neither code injection nor detouring is officially supported. I can’t tell who did the detouring. Maybe somebody added a detour to the uninstaller, unaware that the uninstaller is going to inject a call to the detour into Explorer. Or maybe the detour was injected by anti-malware software. Or maybe the detour was injected by Windows’ own application compatibility layer. Whatever the reason, the result was a crash in Explorer.</p>
<p>Which means that people like me spend a lot of time studying these crashes to figure out what is going on, only to conclude that they were caused by other people abusing the system.</p>
<p>If you want to create a self-deleting binary, please don’t use code injection into somebody else’s process. Here’s a way to delete a binary and leave no trace:</p>
<p>Create a temporary file called <code>cleanup.js</code> that goes like this:</p>
<pre>var fso = new ActiveXObject(&#34;Scripting.FileSystemObject&#34;);
fso.DeleteFile(&#34;C:\\Users\\Name\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\cleanup.js&#34;);

var path = &#34;C:\\Program Files\\Contoso\\contoso_update.exe&#34;;
for (var count = 0; fso.FileExists(path) &amp;&amp; count &lt; 40; count++) {
    try { fso.DeleteFile(path); break; } catch (e) { }
    WSH.Sleep(500);
}
</pre>
<p>This script deletes itself and then tries to delete <code>contoso_update.exe</code> for 20 seconds. Run it with <code>wscript cleanup.js</code> and let it do its thing. No code injection, no detours, all documented.</p>
