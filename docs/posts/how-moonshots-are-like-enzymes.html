That’s a steep energy requirement. In other words, it takes a burst of energy for Clark to become Superman. If we need more Supermans, we’ll have to do something to help more Clarks get over the hill.</p><p><strong>So over the hill is a desirable concept here.</strong></p><p>In this analogy, yes. And how does Clark get over the hill? Enter enzymes. </p><p><span>Enzymes are keys made to fit a particular molecule. In our example, let’s say there’s an enzyme that’s perfectly adapted to Molecule C, aka Clark. It attaches to him, and the combined Molecule C + E (that’s Clark plus Enzyme) has different properties and therefore faces a much lower hill.

After that, she works for a while, but Betsy soon finds herself stuck. She’s not getting promoted, and she’s not exactly unhappy but is starting to feel dissatisfied and wonder, “What’s next?” But there’s a really big hill in front of her. Nothing she’s tried is working so far.</p><p>Betsy needs an enzyme to help her get over the hump, but until she finds the right enzyme, she’s stuck at a local equilibrium: a valley between two hills, aka the most thermodynamically stable place in her immediate vicinity.

But until then, she’s stuck. Local equilibria can feel comfortable or stifling, depending on goals, circumstances, and resources. </p><p><span>And the key to getting out of them and finding something even better? Enzymes. Moonshots. Catalysts. Things that disturb the status quo. Sometimes it can even be a lucky discovery. </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/the-real-story-behind-the-worlds-first-antibiotic" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">A moldy petri dish</a><span> was the key that unlocked antibiotic therapy for billions of people.

Maybe we haven’t found the true optimum state yet in many spheres. </span></p><p><strong>Okaaaaaayyyyy, so the risk management piece. </strong></p><p><span>Right. Risk management comes in because enzyme science is </span><em>not </em><span>a perfect analogy for messy human living. In the more ordered world of biology, </span><a href="https://www.livescience.com/45145-how-do-enzymes-work.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">a particular enzyme fits a particular molecule precisely</a><span>. But in the messy world of everyday human living, most moonshots fail. We sometimes have to try a lot of different approaches before we find the perfect fit to get us over the next hill. That process can be frustrating, expensive, and time-consuming. And if we don’t figure it out quickly enough, we can get permanently stuck or even backslide to a less optimal state. </span></p><p>Risk management can help narrow down options and prioritize the ones most likely to succeed, increasing our chances of reaching the next local equilibrium. On the flip side, overzealous risk management can lead us to rule out strategies that would have worked, simply because they seem too far-fetched (which usually means “too distant from current practice”). </p><p><span>But allowing ourselves to explore beyond our usual boundaries can be hugely beneficial. The benefits aren’t limited to consciously planned experimentation, either.
