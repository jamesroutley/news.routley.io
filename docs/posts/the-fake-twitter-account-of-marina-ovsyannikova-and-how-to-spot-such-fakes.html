<p>Being an experienced Twitter user is like being what comedian Jasper Carrott once said of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Doolan">Ed Doolan</a>: <em>“world-famous in Birmingham”</em>.</p>
<p>You have a great deal of knowledge about a relatively small thing, but one advantage that experience and knowledge gives you is an ability to spot fakes.</p>
<p>And earlier today many mainstream media journalists fell for a fake account in the name of Marina Ovsyannikova, the Moscow television editor who bravely interrupted a live broadcast to protest against the invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>This is what she did:</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A woman burst onto Russia’s main live evening newscast today with a sign that says:</p>
<p>“Stop the war</p>
<p>And chanting: “Stop the war! No to war!”<a href="https://t.co/pKVKZFVEM3">pic.twitter.com/pKVKZFVEM3</a></p>

<p>And this is a video that was circulated afterwards:</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ovsyannikova also appears to have recorded a video beforehand in which she blames Putin for the war and apologizes for her work on Russian state TV news. <a href="https://t.co/VuoqtJWcIY">pic.twitter.com/VuoqtJWcIY</a></p>

<p>She was then – unfortunately but unsurprisingly – detained.</p>
<p>And then – this morning – it seemed somehow she was tweeting.</p>

<p>As you can see, the tweets were heavily RTd and favourited.</p>
<p>And the tweets were RTd and favourited by many mainstream media figures.</p>
<p>One even told us, earnestly, that we should take such tweets <em>“at face value”</em>.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>The account was fake.</p>
<p>But not only was it fake, it was self-evidently fake.</p>
<p>From the profile alone, it could be seen it was a recent account.</p>
<p>The bio says<em> ‘former editor’</em> – as if she would have been in a position to change the bio.</p>
<p>The profile pic was a screen-grab from the video circulated <span>after</span> the incident – and one would think there would be better pics available to an authentic account.</p>
<p>The tweets were in English – from a Russian-Ukrainian who was warning Russians about Russian war policy.</p>
<p>Twitter, of course, is blocked in Russia – and although she could be using a VPN, there would be no point in her doing that if she was tweeting under her own name.</p>
<p>And she was being detained anyway.</p>
<p>Scrolling down to before the incident you would see (1) anti-war tweets (2) tagged with the<em> ‘#Anonymous’</em> tag – both of which would be implausible for someone in her role planning to make a surprise intervention in live news:</p>

<p>All this took a few seconds to check and assess.</p>
<p>(Others clicked into the earlier tweets and could ascertain they were with a different Twitter handle – but I was already satisfied they were fake without this further due diligence.)</p>
<p>Some might say that – notwithstanding all these indications to the contrary – the account could still be authentic – or the tweets were being tweeted on her behalf.</p>
<p>Perhaps – but even taking this at its highest, the numerous indications were such that the account should not have been taken at <em>‘face value’</em>.</p>
<p>It probably was a frolic of an opportunist rather than anything more sinister, and when mainstream media people RTd the account, others (understandably) thought the account was legitimate.</p>
<p>(And the account has now been suspended.)</p>
<p>But one should always be critical – some things are true, some things are false, and the job is to work out the difference.</p>
<p>And this critical faculty is maybe required nowadays more than before.</p>
