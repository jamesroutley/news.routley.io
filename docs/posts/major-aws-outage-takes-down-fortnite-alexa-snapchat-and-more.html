    <h1>Major AWS outage takes down Fortnite, Alexa, Snapchat, and more</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A major Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage took down multiple online services for around four hours this morning, including Amazon, Alexa, Snapchat, <em>Fortnite</em>, <a href="https://status.openai.com/incidents/01K80CBJD5Z64DF82KGT3K3QE0">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://x.com/EOSStatus/status/1980194104115150858">Epic Games Store, Epic Online Services</a>, and more.</p><p>As of 6:35AM ET, the <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">AWS status checker</a> is reporting that “most AWS Service operations are succeeding normally now,” and some of the impacted platforms, including <em><a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1980249794502082948">Fortnite</a></em>, <a href="https://x.com/EOSStatus/status/1980226546607726916">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1980239929189036222">Perplexity</a> have announced that they are fully recovered and back online.</p><p>However, as of 9:50AM ET, Amazon says that multiple services in the US-EAST-1 Region are still “impacted” by operational issues, and that it is working towards a full resolution. The AWS dashboard first reported issues affecting the US-EAST-1 Region at 3:11AM ET, with global services in other regions also taken offline. The cause of the outage hasn’t been confirmed, and it’s unclear when regular service will be fully restored.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1obdalz/anybody_else_having_their_alexa_say_sorry_the/?share_id=fJoQ-Ru02X3moE99D2HkA&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">Users on Reddit</a> reported that the Alexa smart assistant was down and unable to respond to queries or complete requests, and in my own experience, I found that routines like pre-set alarms were not functioning. The AWS issue also impacted platforms running on its cloud network, including Perplexity, Airtable, Canva, and the McDonalds app.</p><p>“We are actively engaged and working to both mitigate the issue and understand root cause,” Amazon said in an update published at 3:51AM ET. In a 5:27AM ET update, Amazon said “We are seeing significant signs of recovery. Most requests should now be succeeding. We continue to work through a backlog of queued requests.”</p><p>AWS outages in the US-East-1 region have created widespread disruptions in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759857/amazon-aws-down-outage-taco-bell-mcdonalds-burger-king">2023</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829544/amazon-web-services-overwhelmed-network-outage">2021</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet">2020</a>, forcing multiple websites and platforms offline for several hours before regular service was restored.</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 20th:</strong> added status updates from Amazon.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div>
