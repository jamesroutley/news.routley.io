The <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">AWS status checker</a> is reporting that multiple services are “impacted” by operational issues, and that the company is “investigating increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services in the US-EAST-1 Region” — though outages are also impacting services in other regions globally.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1obdalz/anybody_else_having_their_alexa_say_sorry_the/?share_id=fJoQ-Ru02X3moE99D2HkA&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">Users on Reddit</a> are reporting that the Alexa smart assistant is down and unable to respond to queries or complete requests, and in my own experience, I found that routines like pre-set alarms are not functioning. The AWS issue also appears to be impacting platforms running on its cloud network, including Perplexity, Airtable, Canva, and the McDonalds app. The cause of the outage hasn’t been confirmed, and it’s unclear when regular service will be restored.</p><p>“Perplexity is down right now,” Perplexity CEO <a href="https://x.com/aravsrinivas/status/1980172632600506579?s=46">Aravind Srinivas said on X</a>. “The root cause is an AWS issue. We’re working on resolving it.”</p><p>The AWS dashboard first reported issues affecting the US-EAST-1 Region at 3:11AM ET. “We are actively engaged and working to both mitigate the issue and understand root cause. We will provide an update in 45 minutes, or sooner if we have additional information to share,” Amazon said in an update published at 3:51AM ET.</p><p>In a 5:27AM ET update, Amazon says “We are seeing significant signs of recovery. Most requests should now be succeeding. We continue to work through a backlog of queued requests.”</p><p>AWS outages in the US-East-1 region have created widespread disruptions in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759857/amazon-aws-down-outage-taco-bell-mcdonalds-burger-king">2023</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829544/amazon-web-services-overwhelmed-network-outage">2021</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet">2020</a>, forcing multiple websites and platforms offline for several hours before regular service was restored.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div>
