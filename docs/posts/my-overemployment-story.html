    <h1>My Overemployment Story</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My journey started when I decided to learn how to code as my new years resolution in 2019. By the time the pandemic came around, I found myself working in person as a front end developer. With the covid restriction in place I for the first time in my life found myself working from home. Since a couple of months after the start covid Ive been handling multiple remote jobs at the same time. So you might be asking yourself how can I start overemployment. At one point I was too and scoured the internet for stories to get some inspiration. In this post I will tell my story of how I got into overemployment.</p><p>I started learning to code in 2019 as my new years resolution. At the time I was working at a factory, making plastic parts overnight. I learned mainly by following online tutorials on FreeCodeCamp and YouTube videos. Working overnight allowed me time for self-study without interruptions during normal working hours. After about seven months of self teaching I landed my first job as a front end developer working with HTML and CSS.</p><p>Working as a developer was fun and I quickly learned a lot more than when I was just self teaching. I worked at a consulting company that specialized in creating websites for small businesses. We were based out of the city and had a large open office, which meant lots of people packed into one building. No surprise that when covid started we all got sent home and stayed home for a long time.</p><p>It was definitely not my dream job, but it paid well, there were some interesting projects to work on and my coworkers were great. After I started working from home I quickly fell in love with my new found freedom. I could study and play video games on my down time and work in my underwear, life was great. About a month into working remote I knew I was never going back to the office.</p><h2>Learned about overemployment through a reddit post</h2><p>So after a couple of months of working from home I was scrolling through Reddit and saw a post about an engineer who works seven jobs, at the same time! If I remeber correctly the guy was making close to a million a year and worked barely over 20 hours a week.</p><p>I decided to see if I could at least try getting two jobs since I had so much off time anyways. I used to be able to work 40 hours in an office I am sure I can work 40 from home for two different jobs. After a couple of months of non stop interviewing I landed my second job. This job turned to be a perfect compliment to my first job since it was a timezone away and barely had any meetings. It was also with different tech than the one I use at my first jobs so I was learning twice as much as I was learning with just one job.</p><p>I’ve had two jobs for about a year and a half now. I went from making $40k in 2019 with my first front end gig to now on track to making $440k at the end of this year. I have tried twice to find a third job. My first time I only lasted a week because the job was just not compatible with the overemployed lifestyle. My second attempt the job was hard but I grinded through and finished the three month contract. I am planning on continuing to rotate through third jobs whenever I get offers to pad up my income a bit more.</p><p>Proving to myself that I am able to work multiple jobs at the same time has been immensely helpful in allowing me to build up my skillset, network and resume. I now have no debt and enough money coming in that I don’t have to worry too much about career moves being risky or financially unwise. My impostor syndrome is gone, my confidence to set boundaries at work is through the roof and I no longer worry about going above and beyond for my job because I know I have two more to fall back on.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>And there you have it, my story of starting overemployment. Never pictured my self becoming a millionaire through a job but now I’m in the process of accomplishing it and I am only 2 years away from hitting that goal. I will say that it’s been a long road to get here, and I’ve definitely made some mistakes along the way. But one thing is certain: I’m happy with my decision to work multiple jobs at once, because not only do I feel like its given me more time with my family and friends, but also because it gives me the freedom to pursue other passions in life. It’s also been great for my wallet <a href="https://overemployee.blog/how-much-do-i-make-as-an-overemployee/">(check out my salary breakdown)</a>! I hope you find some inspiration in this post and make your own overmployee journey.</p></div></div>
