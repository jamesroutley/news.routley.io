    <h1>Create a Custom Interactive dashboard using SVG</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>Since I started self hosting a few services, I wanted a custom dashboard something like Grafana Canvas where I could monitor my entire infra and visulaize all my devices and their status on a single screen.</p>
<p>At first, I thought, “Hey, I’ll just design the whole device model with CSS!”</p>
<p>But then reality hit me… that would probably take a decade for someone like me who doesn’t have a frontend background 😅
Then I thought, “Why not ask someone who actually knows a thing or two about frontend?”</p>
<p>So, I reached out to a fullstack developer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adokshaj/">Adokshaj Bhandarkar</a> probably the most frontend savvy person I know, who knows the ins and outs of it like a pro.</p>
<p>After explaining my idea (and all my doubts) to him, he quickly pointed me toward SVG. Using SVG, I realized I could design a custom infrastructure dashboard tailored exactly for my use cases.</p>
<p>These SVGs can be manipulated through the DOM and easily integrated with any frontend. Plus, you can design custom SVGs using tools like Illustrator.
So, I went ahead and designed my own router model, where I can visualize port statuses whether an Ethernet port is connected, disconnected, or administratively disabled, etc.</p>
<p>I may not be a professional designer, but hey, I somehow pulled off the stunt and designed the router model myself! 😄</p>
<p>So, how can SVGs actually be manipulated?
Well, each SVG element has an <code>id</code> and a <code>fill</code> attribute. Using the id, we can target specific elements  in my case, each port on the router model has a unique ID. By changing the fill color dynamically, we can represent different states:</p>
<p>Red for a port that’s shutdown, Green for a port that’s online or up.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can try out the above PoC code:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Run the server: Start by running <a href="https://0xmm.in/posts/custom_dash/server.js">server.js</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the dashboard: Then open <a href="https://0xmm.in/posts/custom_dash/indexhtml.txt">index.html</a> in your browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live SVG monitoring: The SVG files are being watched using npm *<em>chokidar</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test it out: Open <a href="https://github.com/mascarenhasmelson/Mikrotik_svg.git">mikrotik_plain.svg</a> , change some colors, and save the file you’ll see the updates reflected in real time on your Browser!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SVG in action
