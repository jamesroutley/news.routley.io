    <h1>Show HN: Invertornot.com â€“ API to enhance your images in dark-mode</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>
            Make your app&#39;s dark-mode smarter with InvertOrNot. Our API predicts if an image should be inverted for
            optimal
            dark-mode rendering. </p>

        <p><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/recurse-day-1/static/examples.png" width="100%" alt="Example of outputs"/></p><h4>Try it out</h4>
        <p>Upload an image to see InvertOrNot what transformation it would apply to it.</p>
        

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Despite dark-mode&#39;s popularity, images often aren&#39;t automatically adapted to fit it.
            The conservative approach is to reduce the brightness of the image, which can degrade it significantly.
            Inverting the image can be a better solution, but it can&#39;t be applied to all images (see the poor Queen
            Victoria).</p>

        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>The API works by finetuning an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946">EfficientNet</a> model on a custom
            dataset using PyTorch. By using deep learning we are able to
            have a
            much more reliable approach to solve this problem, the only alternative being heuristics.</p>

        <h4>How can I use it?</h4><p>
        Documentation is available <a href="https://cceckman.com/docs/">here</a>. If possible cache or store the results provided by the API
        to avoid unnecessary calls.
