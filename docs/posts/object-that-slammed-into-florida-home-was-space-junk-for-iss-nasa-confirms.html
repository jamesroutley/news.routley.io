Even these tiny shards pose a danger to satellites and other orbiting assets, given the tremendous speeds at which they travel. For example, at 250 miles (400 kilometers) up — the average altitude of the ISS — orbital velocity is about 17,000 mph (27,400 kph).</p><p>And, as has been demonstrated, some of this junk comes crashing back to Earth from time to time.

But more importantly how in the future to arrange the payload so it will burn in its entirety as it reenters,&#34; Otero <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Alejandro0tero/status/1768954686810316938" target="_blank" data-url="https://twitter.com/Alejandro0tero/status/1768954686810316938">wrote via X on March 8</a>, shortly after his home was hit.</p>
