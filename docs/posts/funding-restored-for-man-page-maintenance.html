    <h1>Funding restored for man-page maintenance</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
Man pages maintainer Alejandro Colomar <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/989215/">announced</a> in September that he was suspending
his work due to a lack of support.  He has now <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/nimzecx26lzxo2v64qjazmisbwfeljpto522wlnauktqesmdoc@gv3yrp64cvug">let
it be known</a> that funding has been found for the next year at least:
</p><blockquote>
	We&#39;ve been talking for a couple of months, and we have already
	agreed to sign a contract through the LF [Linux Foundation], where
	a number of companies provide the funds for the contract.  The
	contract will cover the next 12 months for the agreed amount, and
	we should sign it in the following days.  Since I&#39;ve already seen a
	draft of the contract, and it looks good, I&#39;ve already started
	maintaining the project again, starting on Nov 1st.
