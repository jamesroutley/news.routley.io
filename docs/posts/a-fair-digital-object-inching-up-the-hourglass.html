    <h1>A FAIR Digital Object - Inching up the Hourglass</h1>

<p>Whether deliberate<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> or inevitable<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, the hourglass architecture of the Internet supports a
great diversity of applications implemented using a great diversity of supporting services:</p>

<p>Could there be a minimal “spanning layer” protocol for FAIR-principled<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> applications and
services? The <a href="https://fairdo.org/">FAIR Digital Object (FDO)</a> has emerged as a conceptual nexus for
consideration of such a protocol.</p>
<p>There is a working draft online for an FDO framework.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> In it, an identifier resolves to a
digital object (byte sequence) by default, but one may also request a so-called identifier record.
This record would certainly support – via a simple qualified reference – the operation of
accessing the identified object’s value-obvious situational information, i.e. the raw byte sequence.
Crucially, the identifier record would also support – again, via simple qualified references –
operations to access methodological (still value-obvious to certain consumers) and more
philosophical (epistemic, ontological, axiological – value typically not obvious) information:</p>
