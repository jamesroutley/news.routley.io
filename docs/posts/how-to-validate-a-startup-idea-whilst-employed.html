    <h1>Ask HN: How to validate a startup idea whilst employed?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi HN,</p><p>Everytime I read articles and consume all other content around attemping a startup, I see no consideration for those whom are employed under employement contract to assign both moral rights and intellectual property to their employer. I have read Lean Startup by Eric Ries and consumed a ton of Y combinator content.</p><p>Under these circumstances, how can one validate the market using a minimal vialable product, for something truly novel? Futhermore, the&#39;re contractually unable build an MVP as result of assigning their full intellectual property rights for anything loosely related to their job.</p><p>What can one do under these circumstances, and let&#39;s face it, its found in the majority of employment contracts within the tech industry?</p><p>Anyone any thoughts on this? Moreover, I&#39;m considering leaving a very well paid software developer job to free myself of this obligation, with the intention of building a product to offer real value to both me and others alike.</p></div></div></div>
