    <h1>Basketball has evolved into a game of calculated decision-making</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Basketball has evolved from a game of unpredictability into a game of calculated decision-making with the use of data and analytics. From a game of points, assists, and rebounds, it has progressed into using thousands of data points to optimize every element of the game.</p><p>All decisions are made based on numbers not intuition. Long-range shooting and layups are preferred over mid-range shooting. Players are no longer do-it-alls; they are now given specialized roles.</p><h3>Three-point rain</h3><p>In the last decade, long-range shooting has gone from a secondary option to a primary choice for building offense. Recently, teams have realized three-pointers have higher point value despite their lower scoring percentage. This has led to a revolution in structuring an offense around taking long-range shots. The Golden State Warriors, led by Stephen Curry, probably jump-started this trend with 34 three-pointer attempts per game in the 2018-19 season, twice as much from five years ago. Celtics, this season, have averaged almost 50 three-pointers attempt this season (2024-25 season).</p><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=""><p><img alt="" role="presentation" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height=&#39;236&#39; width=&#39;400&#39; xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39; version=&#39;1.1&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E"/></p><picture><source type="image/webp" data-srcset="/static/0725130a5ccae46a5f922c287a8a87b7/83e39/basketball2.webp 100w,/static/0725130a5ccae46a5f922c287a8a87b7/53a86/basketball2.webp 200w,/static/0725130a5ccae46a5f922c287a8a87b7/4a8c8/basketball2.webp 400w" sizes="(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr="" data-main-image="" sizes="(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw" decoding="async" loading="lazy" data-src="/static/0725130a5ccae46a5f922c287a8a87b7/14d1d/basketball2.png" data-srcset="/static/0725130a5ccae46a5f922c287a8a87b7/93a8b/basketball2.png 100w,/static/0725130a5ccae46a5f922c287a8a87b7/5fd93/basketball2.png 200w,/static/0725130a5ccae46a5f922c287a8a87b7/14d1d/basketball2.png 400w" alt="NBA 3-pt average per game"/></picture></div><p>In the past, the team built its roster around a big name like Shaq. Most of the offense were from the center. This has now changed, with the primary strategy being to stretch the opposition and take long-range shots.</p><h3>Rise of 3-and-D model</h3><p>The 3-and-D model refers to a player, usually a wing player, who is just above average at three-pointers and plays competent defense.  Forget about positions; just get a guy who can do some 3s and Ds.</p><p>Danny Green is probably the father of this model, with his 40% career three-point field goal percentage and he also made into all-defensive team.</p><p>In  recent years, every team has had at least one 3-and-D model player on the roster.</p><h3>Specialization</h3><p>Gone are the days of an all-around player. There is no longer a need for a player who does everything. Look at players like Kobe Bryant and Lebron James (early career); they not only scored but guarded defense, caught rebounds and played the role of playmakers.</p><p>Now, it’s all about creating lineups with specialized players. A team typically consists of a three-point shooter, a defensive specialist, a playmaker, and rebounders. They all have specific roles assigned to them.</p><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=""><p><img alt="" role="presentation" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height=&#39;269&#39; width=&#39;450&#39; xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39; version=&#39;1.1&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E"/></p><picture><source type="image/webp" data-srcset="/static/a797bc0eac630491d1dea907b921fed5/4999a/basketball1.webp 113w,/static/a797bc0eac630491d1dea907b921fed5/b2693/basketball1.webp 225w,/static/a797bc0eac630491d1dea907b921fed5/5b837/basketball1.webp 450w" sizes="(min-width: 450px) 450px, 100vw"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr="" data-main-image="" sizes="(min-width: 450px) 450px, 100vw" decoding="async" loading="lazy" data-src="/static/a797bc0eac630491d1dea907b921fed5/3c337/basketball1.png" data-srcset="/static/a797bc0eac630491d1dea907b921fed5/c8387/basketball1.png 113w,/static/a797bc0eac630491d1dea907b921fed5/26052/basketball1.png 225w,/static/a797bc0eac630491d1dea907b921fed5/3c337/basketball1.png 450w" alt="Average distance for goal attempt"/></picture></div><h3>Technology</h3><p>A catch-all word for statistics, technology has played a pivotal role in shaping this game. </p><p>In addition to data collection, biomechanics and motion cameras track every player’s movement. NBA even brought SportVU from football; it follows the ball and supposedly captures images 25 times per second. Coaches can now use this to analyze the speed, position, form, and motion of each player on the court. </p><p>In the end, it’s all about optimizing every ball possession. </p><h3>What now?</h3><p>Basketball might have lost its flair; every move is now predictable and measured. What is the future of basketball, is anyone’s guess? Maybe a rule change is around the corner?</p></div></div>
