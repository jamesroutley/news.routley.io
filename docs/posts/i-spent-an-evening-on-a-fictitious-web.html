    <h1>I spent an evening on a fictitious web</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>I saw <a href="https://websim.ai">https://websim.ai</a> a couple of weeks ago but didn&#39;t quite get it, and then during some research on the creator and web developer ecosystems I came back to it and my mind was blown.</p>
<p>I spent the evening exploring a web that is full of applications and sites and only limited by URLs that I could think of (heh - this web never has a 404 or an unregistered domain). WebSim provides a simulation of the web via a faux Web Browser. It&#39;s a web that doesn&#39;t actually exist, but one that works incredibly well. I obviously went to <a href="https://websim.ai/@paul_kinlan/paul-kinlan-s-blog">my site first</a> (note - I re-did this when I published it).</p>
<p><img src="https://paul.kinlan.me/images/websim-paulkinlan-me.png" alt="paul.kinlan.me on websim"/></p>
<p>I then created a clone of <a href="https://websim.ai/@paul_kinlan/everytimezone-com">everytimezone</a> (I needed to arrange a meeting in the NYC and Mountain View)</p>
<p><img src="https://paul.kinlan.me/images/websim-everytimezone.png" alt="everytimezone on websim"/></p>
<p>And then I built an interactive globe showing population of <em>some</em> major cities</p>
<p><img src="https://paul.kinlan.me/images/websim-globe.png" alt="3d globe on websim"/></p>
<p>And then I wanted to see if I could create a <a href="https://websim.ai/@paul_kinlan/discover-toya-a-cultural-journey-in-hokkaido">simple site for a trip to Toya in Hokkaido</a></p>
<p><img src="https://paul.kinlan.me/images/websim-hokkaido.png" alt="Toya on websim"/></p>
<p>My wife and I created a site that showcases the beauty of North Wales to a Japanese audience (we didn&#39;t publish it)... and I just explored and explored. I played with simple games, interactive experiences, I even got on a plane.... It&#39;s like the Web&#39;s Roblox.</p>
<p>The entire evening reminded me of when I first discovered blogging and would just go from site to site, reading and playing with the things people built and just having a lot of fun. On one hand this was demonstrates an entire virtual world that I just got lost for hours in this new virtual world, on the other the fact that entire sites and functioning games and apps work is just mind blowing.</p>
<p>I really do encourage everyone to try and play with <a href="https://websim.ai">https://websim.ai</a> even if it takes a little while to get the hang of the <a href="https://websim.ai/@katwinter/websim-ui-guide">UI for generating sites</a>.</p>

  <p>We want people to have the best experience possible on the web without
    having to install a native app or produce content in a walled garden.</p>
  <p>Our team tries to make it easier
    for developers to build on the web by supporting every Chrome release, creating great content to support
    developers on <a href="https://web.dev">web.dev</a>, contributing to MDN, helping to improve browser
    compatibility, and some of the best
    developer tools like Lighthouse, Workbox, Squoosh to name just a few.</p>

    Chrome or Web development in general, so if you want to chat with me
    directly, please feel free to <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ1oCSKm0GUfSpb6HdP01Vzqj2qmmt6YvX3mgJ3xK2kM3C2skac79oFar0rEUkepNpmRTdEmP4iF">book
