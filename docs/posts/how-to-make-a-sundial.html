          <p>This page is about Sundials. Sundials are instruments that tell you the time with the shadow of the sun. To design a sundial you need to know exactly where you are going to put it, i.e. you need to know the longitude, the latitude and the orientation of the wall with respect to North.</p>

              <p>Your sundial can be configured to show civil time or civil daylight-saving time, so that it gives you your country&#39;s official time as you can see it on TV or your watch. Furthermore it can be configured to show the natural &#34;true local time&#34; as you can see it on ancient sundials.</p>

	      <p>Moreover, you have the possibility to put your vertical Sundial on a window and read the hour from inside the room. In this case the numbers are printed to be read from inside.</p>
