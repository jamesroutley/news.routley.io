What is causing the spike? And what is the human impact on the affected merchant sailors?</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Ivan (not his real name), spoke to me last month from an oil tanker that lies abandoned outside the territorial waters of China. He is a senior deck officer.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;We had a shortage of meat, grain, fish, simple things for survival,&#34; said the Russian officer. &#34;It&#39;s affected our health and our operational atmosphere.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;The crew was hungry, the crew was angry, and we tried to survive only day-by-day.&#34;</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The ship, which we are not naming to protect Ivan, is loaded with nearly 750,000 barrels of Russian crude oil with a nominal value of around $50m (£37m). It had set sail from Russia&#39;s Far East for China in early November.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>It was reported abandoned in December, by global trade union organisation the International Transport Workers&#39; Federation (ITF), after the crew said they had not been paid for months.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The vessel remains in international waters. Such is the level of scrutiny surrounding it that China is understood to be unwilling to allow it into port.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>However, the ITF has intervened to get Ivan and his colleagues paid up to December, and arranged for food, drinking water and other essentials to be sent to the ship. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>While some crew members have been repatriated, most, like Ivan, are still on board.</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260126-113039-ddae8f6031-web-2.38.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2fb6/live/f8421f20-01b4-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2fb6/live/f8421f20-01b4-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2fb6/live/f8421f20-01b4-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2fb6/live/f8421f20-01b4-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2fb6/live/f8421f20-01b4-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2fb6/live/f8421f20-01b4-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2fb6/live/f8421f20-01b4-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2fb6/live/f8421f20-01b4-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="ITF A group of people stand in the water as they crowd around an abandoned ship"/><span>ITF</span></p></div><p><figcaption>Sometimes ships are abandoned in port, while others are left out at sea</figcaption></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Back in 2016, 20 ships were abandoned around the world, according to the ITF. In 2025 the number had ballooned to 410, with 6,223 merchant seamen falling victim. Both of those figures for last year were up by almost a third on 2024.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Geopolitical instability is said to have been a driving factor of the increase in recent years. Widespread conflicts around the world and the Covid pandemic have triggered supply chain disruption and wild variation in freight costs, meaning some operators are struggling to stay afloat.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>But the ITF says the growing prevalence of so-called &#34;shadow fleets&#34; could be contributing to the big spike last year.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>These ships, typically oil tankers such as the one Ivan is stuck on, are more often ageing vessels of obscure ownership, unseaworthy, likely uninsured, and operationally hazardous. And they typically sail under flags of convenience or FOCs - the ships are registered in countries with very limited regulatory oversight.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The shadow fleet vessels are trying to stay under the radar to help countries such as Russia, Iran and Venezuela export their crude in contravention of Western sanctions.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Take the case of Russia. Following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it has faced sanctions that capped the price it can charge for its crude.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>But Russia has found buyers willing to pay a higher price, such China and India, though the latter has now pledged to cease purchases under the terms of a recent US trade deal.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>FOCs have been flown by merchant ships for more than a century, as a means for owners to skirt laws and regulations at home. In the 1920s, it was common for American-owned passenger ships to register in Panama to bypass US prohibition laws and sell alcohol on board.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Panama, Liberia and the Marshall Islands are the most common FOC states, representing 46.5% of all merchant ships by weight, but The Gambia has become a player in recent years.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>In 2023 there were no oil tankers registered to The Gambia, but by March last year it had become paper-host to 35 such vessels. Host nations enjoy sizeable fees.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>FOC vessels feature prominently in abandonment. In 2025 they accounted for 337 ships, or 82% of the total. The number of shadow-fleet ships among this number is unclear, but such is the poor state of these vessels and the sketchy ownership structures behind them, it would appear to expose these crafts and their crews to greater risk.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) guidance is that a seafarer is abandoned when their shipowner fails to cover the cost of his or her repatriation, or has left them without the necessary maintenance and support, or has otherwise unilaterally severed ties with them. The latter includes failure to pay contractual wages for a period of at least two months.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The ITF&#39;s General Secretary Stephen Cotton tells the BBC that &#34;abandonment isn&#39;t an accident&#34;. He adds: &#34;Seafarers don&#39;t really know where they&#39;re going.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;They sign a contract, they go to somewhere else in the world, and they&#39;re confronted by lots of different challenges.&#34;</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260126-113039-ddae8f6031-web-2.38.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/16ac/live/5a059660-01b5-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/16ac/live/5a059660-01b5-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/16ac/live/5a059660-01b5-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/16ac/live/5a059660-01b5-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/16ac/live/5a059660-01b5-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/16ac/live/5a059660-01b5-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/16ac/live/5a059660-01b5-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/16ac/live/5a059660-01b5-11f1-8162-915dd1b9ab69.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="ITF A sailor on an abandoned ship pours fresh water from a tank"/><span>ITF</span></p></div><p><figcaption>Crews of abandoned ships risk running out of fresh water</figcaption></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Last year abandoned merchant navy crews around the world were owed a total of $25.8m, according to data from two UN agencies, the IMO, and the International Labour Organization.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The ITF claims they have recovered and returned nearly two thirds of this, $16.5m.
