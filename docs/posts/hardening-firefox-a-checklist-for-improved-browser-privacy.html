<p>If you’re looking for a web browser that offers a high degree of privacy out of the box with minimal setup, <a href="https://brave.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Brave</a> is a common choice. However, I prefer Firefox for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox is developed by the nonprofit organization Mozilla.</li>
<li>I value Mozilla’s commitment to open source software.</li>
<li>Firefox is not based on Chromium. Brave, like most browsers, is based on Chromium, which is developed primarily by Google.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are many web browsers to choose from, I’ve decided Firefox is best for me. This post is a checklist of how I’ve configured it to better protect my privacy while browsing the web.</p>
<h3 id="1-basic-privacy-settings"><a href="#1-basic-privacy-settings">1. Basic Privacy Settings</a></h3>
<p>Access Firefox’s settings by clicking the menu button (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner and selecting “Settings.”</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Change Default Search Engine:</strong> In the <strong>Search</strong> tab, change the “Default Search Engine” to a privacy-respecting option like DuckDuckGo.</li>
<li> <strong>Enable HTTPS-Only Mode:</strong> In the <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong> tab, scroll down to “HTTPS-Only Mode” and select “Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows.”</li>
<li> <strong>Disable Telemetry:</strong> Still in <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong>, scroll to “Firefox Data Collection and Use” and uncheck all the boxes to stop Firefox from sending data back to Mozilla.</li>
<li> <strong>Set Enhanced Tracking Protection to Strict:</strong> Under <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong>, set “Enhanced Tracking Protection” to <strong>Strict</strong>. This offers stronger protection against trackers. If a site breaks, you can easily disable it for that specific site by clicking the shield icon in the address bar.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-recommended-extensions"><a href="#2-recommended-extensions">2. Recommended Extensions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Install uBlock Origin:</strong> A comprehensive content blocker that stops ads and tracking scripts, which speeds up page loading and enhances privacy.</li>
<li> <strong>Install ClearURLs:</strong> This extension automatically removes tracking elements from URLs, helping prevent another form of web tracking.</li>
<li> <strong>Install Privacy Badger:</strong> From the Electronic Frontier Foundation, this extension automatically learns to block invisible trackers. Instead of relying on blocklists, it discovers trackers based on behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-advanced-configuration-aboutconfig"><a href="#3-advanced-configuration-aboutconfig">3. Advanced Configuration (<code>about:config</code>)</a></h3>
<p>To access this, type <code>about:config</code> into the address bar and accept the warning.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Changing advanced configuration preferences can impact Firefox performance or security. Proceed with caution.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Isolate Cookies to the First-Party Domain:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Search for <code>privacy.firstparty.isolate</code> and set its value to <code>true</code>.</li>
<li>This prevents cookies from tracking you from one site to another, but it can break single sign-on on some websites.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Resist Fingerprinting:</strong>
<ul>
<li>I previously set <code>privacy.resistFingerprinting</code> to <code>true</code> to make my browser fingerprint less unique.</li>
<li>It caused minor display issues on some sites and broke image uploads to Bluesky, so I set it back to <code>false</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following this checklist, you can significantly improve your privacy while using Firefox. Please let me know if I’m missing anything in the comments.</p>
