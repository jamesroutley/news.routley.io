    <h1>Show HN: Control Panel for YouTube</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi HN,</p><p>I recently released a new browser extension for YouTube, which in addition to the table stakes of hiding the existence of Shorts, hiding promoted content, automatically skipping ads, hiding useless/unused UI elements, hiding unwanted channels YouTube keeps recommending to you, letting you hide algorithmic suggestions etc. etc., makes other changes I&#39;ve always wanted as a user, in the same vein as one of my other extensions, Control Panel for Twitter.</p><p>The most significant of those is attempting to make your Subscriptions page more like an Inbox, by hiding videos you&#39;ve already watched (with a configurable watch %), videos you&#39;re never going to watch (like live streams and multi-hour stream VODs - if you follow any gaming channels which started co-streaming to YouTube after a recent Twitch policy change), videos you literally can&#39;t watch (Upcoming), and improving the handling of videos hidden using YouTube&#39;s built-in Hide functionality, then finally filling in the gaps created by all those hidden videos, so unwatched content you&#39;re interested in (since you didn&#39;t Hide it yet!) floats to the top of your Subscriptions.</p><p>Desktop and mobile versions of YouTube are both supported, with some version-specific features, e.g. it significantly improves the Subscriptions and Search page layout when doing some comfy-mode browsing of the mobile version on an iPad or other tablet in portrait mode (unfortunately the iOS version is still stuck in App Review limbo, despite the macOS version - which contains the exact same web extension code - being approved on initial submission almost 2 weeks ago).</p><p>Part of the reason for finally making this (I&#39;ve been meaning to improve the Subscriptions page for ages) was YouTube starting to go after uBlock Origin, which I can now disable on YouTube if it becomes necessary, without seeing any promoted content or ads.</p><p>Website: https://jbscript.dev/control-panel-for-youtube</p><p>Source: https://github.com/insin/control-panel-for-youtube</p></div></div></div>
