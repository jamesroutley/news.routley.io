<h5>UPDATE 13.4.23</h5>
<p>REFUSAL OF THE PRIZE of the Sony World Photography Awards, Open Competition / Creative Category at the London Award ceremony:</p>
<p>“Thank you for selecting my image and making this a historic moment, as it is the first AI generated image to win in a prestigous international PHOTOGRAPHY competition.</p>
<p>I applied as a cheeky monkey, to find out, if the comeptitions are prepared for AI images to enter. They are not. </p>
<p>Having been a photographer for 30 years before I turned to AI, I understand the pros and cons of this debate and will be happy to join the conversation.</p>
<p>If you dont know what to do with the prize, please donate it to the fotofestival in Odesa, Ukraine. I will happily provide you the contacts.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<h5>14.3.23</h5>
<p>I am very happy that I won the creative category of Sony World Photography Awards 2023 / Open Competition / Single Image.</p>
<p>I have been photographing since 1989, been a photomedia artist since 2000. After two decades of photography, my artistic focus has shifted to exploring the creative possibilities of AI generators.</p>
<p>The work SWPA has chosen is the result of a complex interplay of prompt engineering, inpainting and outpainting that draws on my wealth of photographic knowledge. For me, working with AI image generators is a co-creation, in which I am the director. It is not about pressing a button – and done it is. It is about exploring the complexity of this process, starting with refining text prompts, then developing a complex workflow, and mixing various platforms and techniques. The more you create such a workflow and define parameters, the higher your creative part becomes.</p>
<p>I have been the first in Germany to teach this as a craft in open online workshops: <span role="gridcell"><a tabindex="-1" role="link" href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.promptwhispering.ai%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0Sj_5QmOdz8Ec486qG95lGKoZiM2REUNNLTRydT90FtXCBt0dVWsDwoPo&amp;h=AT0cvLzYD4YTW_hjA4OXTXVV_a9Wk1ZGB3o4TTf0znqSCCPzbTiBIeDCXghQJ9BOo8LPKxib2XYlXjP32QCWssX0SswJwMpo4-SG9UhqxMjKZWS03TkGit_vIm6Z3woLR3ceTg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">www.promptwhispering.ai</a></span></p>
<p>I call my images “images”. They are synthetically produced, using “the photographic” as a visual language. They are not “photographs”.</p>
<p>Participating in open calls, I want to speed up the process of the Award organisers to become aware of this difference and create separate competitions for AI-generated images.</p>
<p>Doing public talks and being a consultant for universities, magazines, agencies, festivals, museums, and organisations, I see my role as a practitioner of knowledge transfer. As the ‘Head of Digital’ of <a href="https://dfa.photography/en">Deutsche Fotografische Akademie</a>, I am a member of the AI work group of <a href="http://deutscher-fotorat.de/">Deutscher Fotorat</a>, in which the German photo associations discuss the chances and risks of this disruptive technology at large.</p>
