Police reported the vehicle lost control, veered off the road, hit a pole and caught fire. <!-- --></p><p>The following month, US safety regulator the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), announced it was reviewing the VinFast VF8. VinFast said it was cooperating with the investigation.<!-- --></p><p>The reports of the crash prompted Mr Denli to publish the posts <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VinFastCommunity/comments/1d3be8z/i_designed_major_sections_of_vinfast_ask_me/?rdt=62979">on a Reddit account<!-- --></a> saying he had worked on the design of the car and it was a vehicle he believed endangered lives.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;I would get into every other vehicle I have designed from other brands… and every vehicle has flaws… But Vinfast, I wouldn&#39;t get into one… never will and I won&#39;t let my loved ones get into one either,&#34; he wrote.<!-- --></p><p>Two months later, on 18 July this year, Mr Denli&#39;s contract at JLR was terminated.<!-- --></p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/61dd/live/247e3830-bc97-11ef-8d74-9336f9cf2a33.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/61dd/live/247e3830-bc97-11ef-8d74-9336f9cf2a33.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61dd/live/247e3830-bc97-11ef-8d74-9336f9cf2a33.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/61dd/live/247e3830-bc97-11ef-8d74-9336f9cf2a33.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/61dd/live/247e3830-bc97-11ef-8d74-9336f9cf2a33.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/61dd/live/247e3830-bc97-11ef-8d74-9336f9cf2a33.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/61dd/live/247e3830-bc97-11ef-8d74-9336f9cf2a33.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61dd/live/247e3830-bc97-11ef-8d74-9336f9cf2a33.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images A bright blue VinFast electric car plugged in at an outdoor charging station.
