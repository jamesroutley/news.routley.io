    <h1>On ELF, Part 2</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>The Executable and Linkable Format, ELF, is too complex.
I firmly feel it was created without critically thinking about the ramifications it would have on future tool chains.
In this article,
I show how ELF-like features can be safely retrofitted onto executable formats contemporary with ELF’s debut.
Hopefully, future executable format authors will reconsider their needs more critically in the future before committing to something as complicated as ELF.</p>

<h2 id="basic-principles">Basic Principles</h2>

<p>Before writing this installment,
I had a realization.
One of the big mistakes from Unix,
besides the X Window System,
was the <code>ld</code> linker.
At the time, it must have seemed like a great idea!
Put yourself in the original authors’ shoes:
why should the kernel spend so much effort relocating a binary
when that image will just appear at the same place in every process?
So, why not just relocate any linked executable at that point <em>before</em> the kernel ever gets a chance to see it?
The kernel can be made much simpler
(just read in an opaque binary blob, then call a specified address),
and as a nice side-effect,
it’s faster to load the programs as well,
which was probably noticeable on timesharing systems of that era.</p>

<p>But, as we’ve seen in the <a href="https://kestrelcomputer.github.io/kestrel/kestrel/2018/01/29/on-elf">previous article,</a>
this can open a can of worms from the security point of view
as well as constrain new features,
such as the new hotness at about this time, component-oriented programming
(what eventually led to CORBA and DCOM).
It turns out that program relocation at load-time is a <em>good</em> thing.<sup><a href="#opposingView">1</a></sup>
The design of ELF, in part,
reflects the realization that mistakes were made in the past,
and AT&amp;T wanted to both move forward with new features while preserving at least some of their initial investment.
(Aside: I, personally, have mixed feelings about this;
but, this article is not about those specific feelings.)</p>

<p>So, <em>why</em> is <code>ld</code> such a big mistake?
Bluntly, it’s a tool which, like ELF, fails to adhere to the Unix philosophy of
doing one thing well.
See, <code>ld</code> is responsible for at least two services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Linking multiple compiler artifacts into a single artifact for later re-use in the construction of software, and,</li>
  <li>Producing a loadable binary from one or more of these re-usable artifacts.</li>
</ul>

<p>While these two concepts are clearly <em>related</em>,
they are most definitely not <em>the same thing</em>.
We see that the
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/new_c_compilers/new_c_compiler.pdf">Plan 9 compiler toolchain</a>
partially remedies this past oversight
by keeping software in a binary representation of an assembly language listing
for as long as possible before the very last step of producing the final binary executable.</p>

<p>Basically, there are two principles involved.</p>

<p><strong>Principle of Linking.</strong>
A linker’s job is to coalesce, merge, and perhaps even sort <em>sections</em> of equivalent <em>type</em>.
If it helps you, think of it as a merge-sort for related code.
A typical program might have hundreds of sections,
which a linker might reduce to a smaller, perhaps still quite numerous, quantity.
Ultimately, by the time you yield a final executable,
it’s been massaged down to a much smaller set
(typically, text, data, and BSS).</p>

<p><strong>Principle of Loading.</strong>
A loader’s job is to unmarshall the concrete program representation in memory from an off-line representation.
This <em>prepares</em> a program for execution.
In the case of dynamic linking,
a loader <em>may</em> perform some basic relocations,
but <em>it never merges sections of comparable types.</em>
It just lays them out in the address space somehow.
This can be seen on any Linux installation by looking at a process’ memory map layout
(<code>sudo cat /proc/$PID/maps</code>,
which will show each dynamically loaded module’s text, data, BSS, and stack segments).
I’m sure BSD and Plan 9 have similarly accessible methods of showing this information.</p>

<p>Where <code>ld</code> goes wrong, then,
is that it attempts to both <em>link</em> and <em>load</em> in one step.
The limitations of this approach do not become visible as long as</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your runtime environment is isolated via a page-capable MMU, and,</li>
  <li>You have no need whatsoever for dynamic linking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Violate any of these assumptions, and
<code>ld</code>’s approach breaks down hard.
This is why <code>ld</code> requires so many horrible-looking arguments when linking code together:
one set of options intends to put a choke-hold on <code>ld</code> from building an executable or shared object
when all you want is a relocatable module,
while another set is often to do just the opposite.</p>

<p>I mention this only because
I want this article to focus exclusively on <em>program loading.</em>
That is, nothing I write in this article is intended to relate to <em>linking</em> at all.
The formats below may or may not make suitable targets for linkers.
In fact, there’s a great chance that they won’t at all.
Plan 9 accepts this.  There’s no reason why the progeny of Unix can’t either.</p>

<p>So, with the full understanding that we’re talking <em>exclusively</em> about <em>loading</em> programs,
let us now tear ELF a new hole in its address space by illustrating viable alternatives to it.</p>

<h2 id="elf-versus-gemdos-prg-format">ELF versus GEMDOS PRG Format</h2>

<p>In the previous article,
I had stated that the <code>a.out</code> format was
one of the earliest and most portable of executable formats around.
To illustrate this point,
let’s compare <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/man51.pdf">Unix’s original <code>a.out</code> format</a> to
an OS where you might not have expected it to show up:
<a href="http://toshyp.atari.org/en/005005.html">Atari TOS and GEMDOS</a>,
the two components that make up the Atari ST/TT’s operating system.</p>

<p><strong>PDP-11 Unix</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code>struct aout_unix {
    short   a_magic;    // 0x0085
    short   a_textsz;   // Size of .text segment
    short   a_symsz;    // Size of symbol tables
    short   a_relocsz;  // Size of fixups
    short   a_datasz;   // Size of .data segment
    short   a_padding;
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Atari TOS</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code>typedef struct
{
   WORD  ph_branch;        /* Branch to start of the program  */
                           /* (must be 0x601a!)               */

   LONG  ph_tlen;          /* Length of the TEXT segment      */
   LONG  ph_dlen;          /* Length of the DATA segment      */
   LONG  ph_blen;          /* Length of the BSS segment       */
   LONG  ph_slen;          /* Length of the symbol table      */
   LONG  ph_res1;          /* Reserved, should be 0;          */
                           /* Required by PureC               */
   LONG  ph_prgflags;      /* Program flags                   */
   WORD  ph_absflag;       /* 0 = Relocation info present     */
} PH;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The respective fields appear in different places depending on which header is used.  But, that’s OK; ELF 32-bit and 64-bit structures also have fields which move about to support different processor alignment restrictions.</li>
  <li>TOS supports an explicit <code>.bss</code> segment, while the original Unix loader did not.  BSS was just a pre-zeroed bunch of bytes tacked onto the end of <code>.data</code>, and accounted for in <code>a_datasz</code>.</li>
  <li>Interestingly, both the PDP-11 and the 68000 formats supported fixups to resolve code and data references.  This suggests there was a time when Unix did not run with a page-based MMU.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the file header,
you’ll find the actual executable artifacts:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>+-------------------------------+
| PH header                     |
+-------------------------------+
| TEXT segment                  |
+-------------------------------+
| DATA segment                  |
+-------------------------------+
| Symbol table                  |
+-------------------------------+
| Relocation table              |
+-------------------------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it:
there are no tables containing pointers to segments,
there are no complex graphs to traverse to get at some piece of information,
there exists no reason to invest more than a handful of printed pages to describe the entire structure.
Despite this minimalism,
the <code>a.out</code> format is surprisingly versatile.
It supported TOS applications in a single address space,
it supported MultiTOS applications in a single address space,
and it later supported MultiTOS applications in <em>separate</em> address spaces as well.
Clearly, we see that <code>a.out</code> is quite adept
at handling both DOS-like and Unix-like environments with equal facility.</p>

<p>Note that some details differ between the two <code>a.out</code> headers.
That’s perfectly OK.
Exact layout doesn’t matter,
what matters are the concepts supported.
It gives the loader just enough information to allocate a chunk of memory for code,
a chunk of memory for data and BSS,
to locate the relevant data in the files and load them into the allocated memory,
and then apply fixups to resolve broken references.
The <code>a.out</code> binaries were self-contained and self-consistent otherwise:
it was not possible to legally create an <code>a.out</code> file
which referred to an undefined symbol.
Intra-segment relocations
(for instance, where a symbol in module A’s <code>.text</code> segment
refers to a symbol in the <code>.text</code> segment in module B)
are resolved by the linker <em>prior</em> to emitting the final <code>a.out</code>,
often relying upon PC-relative or register-relative addressing.
Absolute references (e.g., with JSR or JMP instructions,
or when storage in <code>.data</code> was referenced from a location in <code>.text</code>)
were resolved using the bundled fixups.
The reason for this is that there was little to no guarantee that <code>.data</code> and <code>.text</code>
would remain adjacent in the computer’s address space,
particularly for single-address space environments.</p>

<p>In my previous article,
I’d stated that <code>a.out</code> was intended to be loaded/mapped blindly as an opaque blob.
This is especially evident in the original Unix header,
as the “magic” field, used to identify executables from other file types,
is <em>literally</em> a PDP-11 machine language instruction that <em>jumps over the header.</em>
The Atari TOS program header continues this tradition.</p>

<h3 id="extending-to-support-dynamic-linking">Extending to Support Dynamic Linking</h3>

<p>OK, so now that we’ve seen how trivial <code>a.out</code> is,
how do we extend it to support dynamic linking?
Pretend, for a moment, that you were in charge of adding
dynamic linking to MultiTOS for its next release.
How would you retrofit this loader format to do so?
Here is how <em>I</em> would handle the task.</p>

<h3 id="required-extensions">Required Extensions</h3>

<p>The first task would be to identify what additional support
is required to handle the job.</p>

<p>First and foremost, a statically linked binary
is expected to be self-contained.
Dynamic linking throws that assumption out the door;
therefore, we need a way for a module to identify its dependencies.
So, we need to introduce a segment that lists library dependencies.
Let’s not concern ourselves with precise layout at this point;
we only need to know that it consumes space in the file, and thus,
has a size field associated with it.</p>

<p>Second, we observe that dynamically linked modules
may require symbols defined in the executable.
It turns out <code>a.out</code> has us covered here,
as both PDP-11 and TOS versions of the file support a symbol table explicitly.
Convenient!
So out-bound definitions are taken care of;
however, <em>in-bound</em> relocations are not.
There are two ways to handle this:
first, we can extend the existing symbol table definition
to support both symbol definitions <em>and</em> symbol references,
or we can introduce a separate symbol table segment just for in-bound references.
Just to make things harder and for the sake of illustration,
we’ll assume the latter.
In the real-world, I’d probably shoot for the former.</p>

<p>To support in-bound symbol relocations,
we will also need to extend our relocation records.
Atari TOS uses a very simplistic model:
every N bytes, add the base address of the appropriate segment to the 32-bit word at that current location.
Again, the assumption is that references are self-consistent/self-contained,
so this is fine if all you’re doing is relocating a microcosm of code.
For dynamic linking, however,
we need to know not only where to perform the relocations,
but also against what symbol.
For this reason,
I would replace individual bytes in the relocation segment
with 32-bit words, with a layout along these lines:</p>

<div><div><pre><code> 3 2 2         0
 1 4 3         0
+---+-----------+
| D |     d     |  Type 1
+---+-----------+

+---+-----------+
| D |     S     |  Type 2
+---+-----------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This makes for a larger executable file, but is also substantially more flexible.
The rules are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If D=255, then we have a type-1 relocation record, which basically says, “There’s no relocation at this point; however, the next relocation record is going apply <em>d</em> bytes from here in the file.”</li>
  <li>If D&lt;255, then we have a type-2 relocation record.  This says to the loader, “Fix up the current 32-bit word with the value of the <em>S</em>-th symbol in the symbol table, then advance <em>D</em> (capital!) bytes in the program image.”</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases,
we know if we’re making a code or data segment reference
based both on the value of the referenced symbol, and
on the relative offset we’re patching in the <code>a.out</code> file.</p>

<p>So far as I’m aware, this is all that is required to make the format support dynamic linking.
Now let’s lay this stuff out into something that makes the task of loading it <em>easy</em>.</p>



<p>Since the initial <code>ph_branch</code> is a 68000 <code>BRA</code> instruction that
skips over the length of the program header,
it follows that if we append our extra fields onto the program header,
then we must adjust the branch offset as well.
This implies we create a new magic cookie for <code>ph_branch</code>
which the loader can use to determine if the binary is dynamically linked or not.</p>

<p>Just in case some other file type uses this same magic value,
we’re going to use an unused <code>ph_prgflags</code> bit to identify a dynamically linked artifact.
Let’s call it <code>PRGF_DYNAMIC</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>ph_branch</code> is correct yet <code>PRGF_DYNAMIC</code> is not set,
then we either have a corrupt program header,
or the file is not actually a dynamically linked executable.
Thus, we reject the file.</p>

<p>The following fields can appear immediately after the <code>ABSFLAG</code> field:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>typedef struct
{
   WORD  ph_branch;         // Magic: 0x6022
   LONG  ph_tlen;           // as before.
   LONG  ph_dlen;           // as before.
   LONG  ph_blen;           // as before.
   LONG  ph_slen;           // as before.
   LONG  ph_res1;           // as before.
   LONG  ph_prgflags;       // Make sure PRGF_DYNAMIC is set!
   WORD  ph_absflag;        // as before.
   LONG  phx_deplen;        // Length of dependencies.
   LONG  phx_implen;        // Length of imported symbols.
} PHDYN;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Observe that loading the module’s code and data segments
is meaningless
if we can determine ahead of time that
we cannot satisfy this module’s dependencies.
For this reason, we need only insert our list of dependencies
and symbol imports, in that order, <em>ahead</em> of the code segment.
In this way, you can still compute the offsets of everything
without having to provide explicit pointers.
This keeps the size of the header down.
We also take care to order the segments we’ll need in the order we’ll use them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We first find exported symbols, since it’s possible that dependencies may require a symbol defined by the executable itself.  So, the loader must process locally defined symbols first.</li>
  <li>Then, we transitively load dependencies using a depth-first traversal of the dependency tree.</li>
  <li>Once all dependencies have been loaded, <em>then</em> we can resolve imported symbols for <em>this</em> module.  If any are left unresolved, then we abort further loading with an undefined symbol error.</li>
  <li>At this point, we can finally handle loading our TEXT, DATA, and BSS segments, along with any relocations they may require.</li>
</ul>

<p>By doing things in this order,
we minimize unnecessary seeking through the file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>+-------------------------------+
| PHDYN header                  |
+-------------------------------+
| exported symbols (new)        |
| (replaces old symbol table)   |
+-------------------------------+
| dependencies (new)            |
+-------------------------------+
| imported symbols (new)        |
+-------------------------------+
| TEXT segment                  |
+-------------------------------+
| DATA segment                  |
+-------------------------------+
| Relocation table (new)        |
| (replaces old reloc table)    |
+-------------------------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="normative-procedures">Normative Procedures</h3>

<p>Here, we get to the basic algorithm of loading and relocating a dynamic executable using this format.</p>

<p>You’ll notice a reference to a <em>global context</em>.
This is some arbitrary data structure
that serves as a global record-keeping device
keeping track of resources allocated and/or files opened.
In Unix, this would be the process itself.
For something like TOS, this structure would need to exist separately.
Either way, it’s required if we want to properly track resources
in the event we return with an error.
Otherwise, resources will be allocated but unable to be freed,
since we wouldn’t have a long-standing reference to them.
The context also serves as a rendezvous point for symbols,
where they’re defined,
and what value they equate to.</p>

<p>First, we start out at the top level:
when loading a PRG, we dispatch to the appropriate loader based on <code>ph_branch</code> values.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>PROCEDURE LoadPRG(filename)
BEGIN
    Read first two bytes of file.
    IF ph_branch == 0x601A THEN
        Load statically linked PRG file.
    ELSIF ph_branch == 0x6022 THEN
        Create global loader context.
        LoadDynamicPRG(filename, context)
    ELSE
        Return with an unrecognized file type error.
    END
END
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The legacy loader, as defined in GEMDOS, can be used to load the statically-linked executable,
so I won’t repeat its pseudo-code here.
Instead, let’s focus on the dynamic loader.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>PROCEDURE LoadDynamicPRG(filename, context)
BEGIN
    Read rest of the PHDYN header.
    IF PRGF_DYNAMIC not in ph_prgflags THEN
        Return with an unrecognized file type error.
    END

    // Process locally defined symbols so that any dependencies
    // can find them and use them.

    FOR ALL s IN locally defined symbols DO
        Create symbol descriptor for s in the context.
    END

    // Transitively load all dependencies.

    FOR ALL d IN dependencies DO
        Resolve dependency d to library filename.
        LoadDynamicPRG(Filename(dependency), context)
        IF not successful THEN
            Free all allocated or opened resources so far.
            Return with an error code.
        END
    END

    // We&#39;ve just loaded all of our dependencies, and they are
    // happy with the symbols we&#39;ve exported.  Let&#39;s now resolve
    // our own symbol imports.  This can potentially take some
    // amount of time; O(n^2) algorithm.

    FOR ALL s IN imported symbols DO
        FOR all dependencies we loaded above DO
            IF dependency contains symbol THEN
                Create descriptor for s in the context.
                Exit this loop and continue outer loop.
            END
        END
        // No dependency claims to define the symbol.
        // Abort with an undefined symbol error.
        Free all allocated or opened resources so far.
        Return with an error code.
    END

    // We transitively loaded our dependencies.  We&#39;ve resolved
    // all of our symbols.  Now it&#39;s time to load our text and data
    // segments and apply relocations to them.

    AllocateTextSegment()
    ReadTextSegment()
    AllocateDataSegment()
    ReadDataSegment()
    AllocateBssSegment()
    ZeroBssSegment()

    offset = 0
    segment = TextSegment
    IF length(relocations) &gt; 0 THEN
        FOR ALL r IN relocations DO
            IF
                offset &gt;= length(TextSegment) AND
                segment = TextSegment
            THEN
                segment = DataSegment
                offset = offset - length(TextSegment)
            END
            IF
                offset &gt;= length(DataSegment) AND
                segment = DataSegment
            THEN
                segment = BssSegment
                offset = offset - length(DataSegment)
            END
            IF IsType2(r) THEN
                x = GetWord(segment+offset)
                v = SymbolValue(SymbolDescriptorFor(r))
                PutWord(segment+offset, x+v)
            END
            offset = offset + displacement(r)
        END
    END
END
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This pseudo-code is more or less representative of the actions that must be taken
for someone to extend GEM’s PRG format to include dynamic linking abilities.
Actual code is straight-forward,
the code follows the layout of the data as found in the executable file,
and should be easily maintained as future requirements dictate.</p>

<p>This pseudo-code does not handle the case where a shared library is already resident in memory.
However, with a small change to the calling convention of the <code>LoadDynamicPRG</code> procedure,
it should be possible to short-circuit the loading process for resident libraries.</p>

<h3 id="handling-other-processor-architectures">Handling Other Processor Architectures</h3>

<p>The pseudo-code above assumes the same 680x0 processor family that drives the Atari ST/TT line.
As written, it won’t scale to newer architectures.
Many RISC processors requires multiple kinds of relocations to resolve references,
since instructions rarely can pack a full word’s worth of bits in an instruction.
For example, a RISC-V processor can only address +/- 2KiB from some base address.
For a 32-bit address, then, you need to break the reference up across two instructions:
a LUI instruction to load the upper 20 bits of the address,
and an addition to contribute the lower 12 bits.
Worse still, the addition is sign-extended, which must be accounted for in the upper portion of the address.</p>

<p>A 64-bit RISC-V implementation can’t even use this approach,
for there is no way to embed the upper 32-bits of an address directly into the instruction stream.
You end up loading addresses indirectly from a code or data word of memory,
and <em>that</em> is what receives the relocation.
Alternatively, if the value has lots of binary 0s in it,
you can load a portion of the address in the low-order bits and then shift up appropriately.
As you can see, resolving a 64-bit address on RISC-V can potentially be messy.</p>

<p>Assuming a 64-bit RISC-V target,
the loader will need to understand how to perform a minimum of four different kinds of relocations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Absolute 32-bit relocation</li>
  <li>Absolute 64-bit relocation</li>
  <li>Upper 20-bits for LUI</li>
  <li>Lower 12-bits for ADDI</li>
</ul>

<p>This can be encoded easily enough in the relocation segment of the file.
You just need to make the relocation record format known to the loader somehow,
either implicitly through the <code>ph_branch</code> magic cookie,
or via additional header fields.</p>

<h3 id="handling-initializations-and-finalizations">Handling Initializations and Finalizations</h3>

<p>Some languages,
like Modula-2 and C++,
often require objects to be pre-initialized via “constructors” before the main program begins.
In the case of Modula-2 and Oberon,
the “constructor” is the global body of a module definition.
In C++, D, Sather, et. al., these are provided through more explicit programming constructs on classes.
Either way, they <em>must</em> be invoked for the main program to run correctly.
After all, the executable might be written in plain-vanilla C,
while the library you’re depending upon could very well be written in C++!</p>

<p>In a statically linked executable,
this is not a problem, since the linker is given libraries which are capable of handling this issue.
It has compile-time (at best) or link-time (at worst) knowledge of which routines to call and when.
Thus, it can provide supporting code in the <code>.text</code> segment, and the day is saved.</p>

<p>For dynamically linked executables, however, it’s not as simple.
Since the linker and loader <em>both</em> have no idea what languages modules are written in,
the loader must support a means of calling constructors independently of the main program’s entry point.
The ELF <code>.init</code>, <code>.fini</code>, and related sections all exist
to support languages
which require global constructors to be called before invoking the main program.</p>

<p>We map this to the <code>a.out</code> file by requiring initializers and finalizers to exist in the <code>.text</code> segment.
Further, instead of providing a single routine to call, we express requirements as a <em>vector</em> of routines to call.
These can be handled by extending the <code>a.out</code> header once more with the following fields:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>LONG    phx_ivecbase;   // Offset to base of initializer vector
LONG    phx_ivecsize;   // Number of initializers to call
LONG    phx_fvecbase;   // Offset to base of finalizer vector
LONG    phx_fvecsize;   // Number of finalizers to call
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From the loader’s point of view,
there’s nothing special about these vectors.
The linker must provide zero or more such vector entries for each module it helps produce.
The loader, then, must take on the responsibility of invoking them as it loads module dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="elf-versus-hunk-format">ELF versus Hunk Format</h2>

<p>First, I want to get this off my chest.
There is no such thing as the <em>Amiga</em> Hunk Format.
It’s just … Hunk Format.
Remember, AmigaDOS is just a port of the Tripos operating system to run under the <code>exec.library</code> kernel.
You can find more about Commodore-Amiga’s rebranding of Tripos at this
<a href="http://www.pagetable.com/?p=193">Page Table</a>
article.
I highly recommend it; it’s actually quite fascinating.</p>

<p>Now that that’s cleared up,
let’s talk about hunks.
Big hunks, heavy hunks, small hunks, hot hunks, however you prefer them to be.
A <em>hunk</em> is nothing more than a self-identifying,
often explicitly length-delimited,
array of integers.
Like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>+-----------------------------+
| Hunk Type ID                |
+-----------------------------+
| # of words (4 in this case) |
+-----------------------------+
| 1                           |
+-----------------------------+
| 2                           |
+-----------------------------+
| 3                           |
+-----------------------------+
| 4                           |
+-----------------------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the Amiga’s case, these words are always, <em>always</em>, 32-bits wide.
That’s because <code>dos.library</code> (a.k.a. Tripos) was written in a 32-bit dialect of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL">BCPL</a>.
In STS’s case, these words were always 16-bits wide.
For a 64-bit RISC-V port, they could well be 64-bits wide.
I think you get the idea.</p>

<p>A <em>hunk formatted file</em>, then,
is just a file with an <em>array of hunks</em> in it.
That’s it.  You now understand the structure of a hunk formatted file.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that there’s no mention of text, data, or BSS segments.
No relocations.
No symbol definitions or imports.
That’s because <em>hunk format</em> is a <em>container format</em>,
just as <strong>MP3</strong> is a container for audio, <strong>MP4</strong> for different kinds of video, etc.</p>

<p>Next step, then, is to learn how <code>dos.library</code> and Tripos actually used it to store executable artifacts.</p>

<h3 id="amiga-and-tripos-binary-files">Amiga and Tripos Binary Files</h3>

<p>The Hunk Format executable is naturally multi-processor capable.
Metacomco defined it for the Motorola 68000 processor originally,
the details of which you can read in the
<a href="http://amiga.rules.no/abfs/abfs.pdf">Amiga Binary File Specification.</a>
Since then, however, the Amiga community moved to support the PowerPC processor architecture.
Although modern versions of AmigaOS support ELF,
originally, they simply adopted the Hunk Format to
<a href="http://www.haage-partner.de/amiga/storm/sc_tec_e.htm">include PowerPC-specific hunks.</a></p>

<p>So, right out of the gate,
we <em>plainly</em> see hunk format supports multiple processors.
The fact that I used the basic concepts in a 16-bit OS of my own design
also illustrates that hunk format is not constrained to just AmigaOS.
So multi-processor and platform independence have never been unique selling points for ELF.
And we haven’t even begun to look at the details of hunk format yet.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this article,
however, I will once again concentrate just on the 68000 version of the file.</p>

<p>The large-scale structure of an Amiga executable looks more or less like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>+---------------+
| HUNK_HEADER   |
+---------------+
| HUNK_CODE     |
+---------------+
| HUNK_RELOC*   |
+---------------+
| HUNK_DATA     |
+---------------+
| HUNK_RELOC*   |
+---------------+
| HUNK_BSS      |
+---------------+
| HUNK_END      |
+---------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The layout of a hunk file is intended to be processed with an “event-driven” parser,
which looks more or less like this skeleton pseudo-code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>f = open(&#34;hunkfile&#34;,&#34;rb&#34;);
size = read(f, &amp;id, 4);
done = FALSE;
do {
    size = read(f, &amp;id, 4);
    if(size &lt; 4) goto done_loading;

    switch(id) {
    case HUNK_HEADER: ...
    case HUNK_CODE: ...
    case HUNK_DATA: ...
    case HUNK_BSS: ...
    ...etc...
    case HUNK_END:
        done = TRUE;
        break;
    default: // unknown hunk type?  OK, skip it.
        read(f, &amp;size, 4);
        seek(f, size*4, SEEK_OFFSET);
        break;
    }
    
done_loading:
} while(!done &amp;&amp; (size &gt;= 4));
close(f);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the very structure of a hunk file is intended to simplify the loader a great deal.</p>



<p><code>HUNK_HEADER</code> hunks identify the file as an executable as well as
gives due warning to the loader on the number of segments to allocate and how big they are.
But, hark, look what else it provides!</p>

<div><div><pre><code>+-----------------+
| HUNK_HEADER     |
+-----------------+ -+
| N1              |  |  Names of shared library
+-----------------+  |  dependencies.
| N1 name words   |  |
+-----------------+  |
| N2              |  |
+-----------------+  |
| N2 name words   |  |

+-----------------+
| Last hunk       |
+-----------------+
|                 |
| L-F+1 Sizes     |
|                 |
+-----------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This hunk <strong>includes the names of shared library dependencies.</strong>
The loader is responsible for opening
(and <em>loading</em> if not already in memory)
each specified library prior to loading the rest of the binary.
In this way, transitive dependencies are satisfied.</p>

<p>Assuming this has been done successfully,
the next step is to allocate an array of segment descriptors,
whose size is specified by the hunk table size field.
It then <em>copies the libraries’ hunk descriptors into this image’s descriptor table</em>.
From the loader’s perspective,
all your shared libraries have been <em>included</em> in this image’s hunk table
<em>as if the contents of those libraries came from this executable file</em>.
This greatly eases relocating hunks without having to traverse a complex graph of dependencies.</p>

<p>(Aside:
at this point, if you wanted to, you could theoretically deallocate individual library segment tables,
since the relevant references are now included in this executable’s segment table.
But, it’s not worth it; if these are reusable libraries, they’ll be referenced again later.)</p>

<p>Once all the libraries have been opened and their segment tables merged into this executable’s segment table,
then the fun part happens:
the loader reads the remainder of the hunk to get at the list of hunk sizes.
This gives the loader an opportunity to <em>pre-allocate</em> all the segments it needs to hold the binary in memory.
These segments will take their place sequentially in the hunk table starting at the <code>First hunk</code> index, and
continuing until the <code>Last hunk</code> index, inclusive.</p>

<p>So, if we have a clock executable
that includes (for sake of argument) <code>libc.so</code> and <code>libX11.so</code>,
then the loader’s segment table could well look a lot like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    +----------------+
0   | libc.so CODE   |----&gt;
    +----------------+          points into
1   | libc.so DATA   |----&gt;     libc.so&#39;s
    +----------------+          segments
2   | libc.so BSS    |----&gt;
    +----------------+
3   | libX11.so CODE |----&gt;
    +----------------+          points into
4   | libX11.so DATA |----&gt;     libX11.so&#39;s
    +----------------+          segments
5   | libX11.so BSS  |----&gt;
    +----------------+
6   | clock CODE     |----&gt;
    +----------------+          allocated,
7   | clock DATA     |----&gt;     but not yet
    +----------------+          loaded.
8   | clock BSS      |----&gt;
    +----------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Gosh, this looks an <em>awful</em> lot like the information made accessible
in Linux <code>/proc/$PID/maps</code> files, wouldn’t you agree?</p>

<p>The actual <code>HUNK_HEADER</code> will look vaguely like this in the file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>+-----------------+
| HUNK_HEADER     |
+-----------------+
| 2               | Shared object dependencies

+-----------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After processing the header,
the loader now has a complete description of a program image in memory.
It just doesn’t have any of the specific details hammered out yet.
For that, we need to load our segments with data.</p>

<h3 id="hunks-for-code-and-data">Hunks for Code and Data</h3>

<p><code>HUNK_CODE</code> hunks are for providing what would be considered <code>.text</code> or <code>.rodata</code> content in other formats.
This is where your executable … well, <em>code</em> goes.
Similarly,
<code>HUNK_DATA</code> hunks provide statically allocated/initialized data
that would fall in a <code>.data</code> section in other formats.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>+------------------+
| HUNK_CODE        |
+------------------+
| # words in image |
+------------------+
|                  |
| code             |
|                  |
+------------------+

+------------------+
| HUNK_DATA        |
+------------------+
| # words in image |
+------------------+
|                  |
| data             |
|                  |
+------------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A BSS segment is specified in a similar manner;
however, since its content is implicitly undefined,
we only need to specify how big it is.<sup><a href="#dupInfo">2</a></sup></p>

<div><div><pre><code>+--------------------+
| HUNK_BSS           |
+--------------------+
| # words in segment |
+--------------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that, just like ELF but unlike <code>a.out</code>,
you can have any number of code, data, or BSS segments.
This was useful for earlier versions of AmigaOS,
which did not automatically defragment free chunks of memory.
As a result, there was an incentive to have many smaller code, data, or BSS segments
as a means of working around the memory fragmentation that would inevitably build up like a layer of mold.
You had to be careful though;
<em>too many</em> small segments would actually exacerbate the problem,
especially after you ran and quit an executable linked in this manner several times on a 256KB or 512KB Amiga!
(Thankfully, I believe this issue was fixed with AmigaOS 2.0 or 3.0,
so the incentive to coalesce like-typed sections became much stronger.)</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the hot hunks.</p>

<p>The very first code, data, or BSS hunk that the loader encounters in the file
will obviously be used to load the very first hunk that is defined to belong to this file.
Recall in the header that this was specified by the <code>First hunk</code> field.
Each subsequent code or data hunk would fill subsequent hunk in the hunk table.
<em>Any code or data hunks that would exceed the table would be ignored.</em></p>

<h3 id="relocations">Relocations</h3>

<p>Relocation hunks come in many varieties.
I’m only going to illustrate one: <code>HUNK_RELOC32</code>.<sup><a href="#reloc32short">3</a></sup>
As with the GEMDOS file format,
relocations are to 32-bit absolute addresses only.
By the time you’re loading something into memory,
all PC-relative or base address-relative offsets should have been resolved by the linker first.
There also is a <code>HUNK_PPC_RELOC26</code> for PowerPC branch relocations as well.</p>

<p>The <code>HUNK_RELOC32</code> hunk looks like this on disk:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>+----------------+
| HUNK_RELOC32   |
+----------------+
| N1             |
+----------------+
| Segment 1      |
+----------------+
|                |
| N1 offsets     |
|                |
+----------------+
| N2             |
+----------------+
| Segment 2      |
+----------------+
|                |
| N2 offsets     |
|                |
+----------------+
:                :
+----------------+
| 0              |
+----------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basically, this is saying:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apply <em>N<sub>1</sub></em> relocations to the most recently loaded segment by adding the base address of segment 1 to the 32-bit values at all these offsets,</li>
  <li>Apply <em>N<sub>2</sub></em> relocations to the most recently loaded segment by adding the base address of segment 2 to the 32-bit values at all these offsets,</li>
  <li>and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>This happens until we reach the end of the list of relocations, identified by the final 0 value.</p>

<p>Remember that relocations always apply to the <em>most recently loaded segment.</em>
This is why relocations for a segment always <em>follows</em> the segment to which it applies.
You can have any number of different types of relocations following a code or data hunk.<sup><a href="#initBss">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Also note that it’s perfectly OK to refer to a segment which hasn’t been loaded yet.
Recall that while processing the <code>HUNK_HEADER</code>,
the loader knows how big each segment will be and can thus pre-allocate them.
Obviously, you can also refer to segments which belong to shared libraries.</p>



<p>We’ve seen that Hunk Format executables share just about every major feature with ELF out of the box.
It’s fully capable of supporting ASLR,
and there’s nothing which prevents it from being used in either single- or multiple-address spaces.
The only thing it <em>doesn’t</em> support is statically linked executables pre-designated for a specific load address.
Further, <em>it supports dynamic linking</em>.</p>

<p>Just not the way AT&amp;T specified with ELF.</p>

<p>See, there’s a frailty with how Tripos handles shared objects:
the executable needs to know at link-time where the library’s assets are located
(which segment <em>and</em> the offset within that segment).
On its own, this places a hard dependency on a specific version of a library.
Change the library to a newer version, and those assumptions could well break.</p>

<p>For this reason,
AmigaOS does not support Tripos-style shared libraries.
Instead, it uses its own library system which <code>exec.library</code> provides,
which addresses this exact issue by using well-defined offsets on a <em>jump table,</em>
<a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/2156/how-are-amiga-libraries-structured/2158">itself relative to a kind of handle to the library.</a>
This lets specific addresses of various assets float within their respective binaries,
with only the relative offsets being well-known at compile-time.</p>

<p>Exec’s jump table is exactly like ELF’s <strong>PLT</strong> (Procedure Linkage Table) segment,
only instead of <em>your</em> program constructing it, it’s part of the library you’re trying to call.
Any publicly available data is similarly made available relative to this library base pointer.
This has several advantages over ELF:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No need to keep symbol tables around, so it uses less memory.</li>
  <li>Loading is much faster without having to scan for symbols all the time.</li>
  <li>It’s faster than the ELF-style PLT.  You’re jumping to an unconditional jump instruction, which modern CPU pipelines handle quite elegantly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, it comes at a cost: you can’t just use <code>dlsym()</code> to resolve a symbol on a library.</p>



<p>You can definitely get some great milage out of Tripos’ approach to shared libraries,
despite the aforementioned limitations.
Tripos, circa 1981, was successfully using them to make command-line tools
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIPOS">as small as 512 bytes,</a>
while comparable tools in Linux, even with ELF’s shared objects, require closer to 20KB.
Even accounting for binary size differences of 16-bit and 32-bit platforms,
we’re still looking at an order of magnitude smaller executables for Tripos than we are seeing for Linux.
Arguably, Tripos wins at shared libraries.</p>

<p>But, OK, we want the ability to use C++, and we want unique data segments per process.
How do we get these?</p>

<p><strong>Relieve the linker of detailed knowledge of dependencies.</strong>
This is not a prerequisite for normal, day to day use of Tripos shared libraries.
But, it is definitely a requirement if you want symbols defined in the executable to be usable by those libraries.
There are two ways of resolving this issue.
Either introduce a replacement hunk type for <code>HUNK_HEADER</code> that implies the new semantics,
or specify the use of <em>negative hunk indices</em> as a flag to the loader.
For instance, you can declare bit 31 of <code>First hunk</code> field to be set for “module-relative” hunk indices or some such.
That way, the loader can reference library hunks when that bit is clear, and module-relative hunks when set.
This would apply to all hunk indices, including inside relocations.
The probability of exceed two <em>billion</em> hunks is asymptotically zero on 32-bit systems,
and particularly so on 64-bit systems, so this is a pretty safe extension.</p>

<p><strong>Retain symbol imports and exports from the linker stage.</strong>
This is a requirement that’s been discussed above under the GEMDOS section;
it’s required if you want to allow libraries to bind to symbols you create in your executable.<sup><a href="#pandora">5</a></sup>
The loader of a module would need, then,
not only to maintain hunk tables, but also symbol tables.
This would enable, in turn, the next item.</p>

<p><strong>Allocate new data segments on each successful load.</strong>
Since libraries and executables are <em>statically linked</em> in Tripos,
code hunks can freely reference data hunks, thus eliminating completely the need for GOTs.
This implies that Tripos libraries (as with Exec-style libraries) maintain
a shared body of data across all clients of the library.
ELF mandates this <em>cannot</em> happen.
By definition, each new program is in its own address space,
so each library shares <em>only its code</em>;
and at that, this code can appear <em>anywhere</em> in the process’ address space.
All data hunks must be remapped for each address space, uniquely.
To enable this to happen, the loader must recreate data and BSS hunks for each client use-case.</p>

<p><strong>Page aligned code and data segments.</strong>
This is not a hard requirement; don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
Even given an executable with non-aligned segments, you can still <code>mmap</code> them into memory.
You need only give special consideration to the leading and trailing pages,
which may have to be loaded by copying from the file if their boundaries aren’t page aligned.
Given a 4KB page size, this means that you end up transferring no more than 8KB of content.
For larger binaries (which are everywhere on my Linux box, by the way),
the overhead of this would be immeasurable, as the overwhelming bulk of binary content would be memory-mapped as normal.
However, if this is such an important feature to have,
then one could introduce two new hunk types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>HUNK_NULL</code>, which is a null hunk.  It consists <em>only</em> of the <code>HUNK_NULL</code> ID.  No size or payload field follows.</li>
  <li><code>HUNK_SKIP</code>, which contains a size field.  It’s sole purpose is to cause the loader to skip ahead in the file.  The following hunk, presumably a code or data hunk, can then be placed such that <em>its</em> content is page aligned, and so can be <code>mmap</code>ed per normal Unix conventions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>HUNK_SKIP</code> hunk allows for coarse-grained alignment control within the executable,
while <code>HUNK_NULL</code> provides alignment control at individual word granularity.</p>

<p><strong>Support for initializers and finalizers.</strong>
This can be supported fairly easily using two new hunk types:
<code>HUNK_INIT</code> and <code>HUNK_FINI</code>.
As with my GEMDOS modifications above,
these would contain <em>vectors</em> of initialization functions to call.
Unlike GEMDOS, however,
these would not occupy any code or data space.
Rather, the loader would read in a set of hunk and offset pairs,
intended to point at initialization and/or finalization functions,
and call them sequentially in the order provided.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>+-------------------+    +-------------------+
| HUNK_INIT         |    | HUNK_FINI         |
+-------------------+    +-------------------+

| Code Offset N-1   |    | Code Offset N-1   |
+-------------------+    +-------------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So far as I am aware,
this is all that is required for Hunk Format to attain parity with ELF.
Arguably, it is simpler to get Hunk Format working like ELF than it is for GEMDOS,
particularly since the whole arrangement is built to be extensible via an event-driven loader.</p>

<p>As with the GEMDOS loader,
these new semantics can be selected by altering which kind of header hunk appears at the head of the file.
If you want the older-style, Tripos semantics, use <code>HUNK_HEADER</code>.
For the newer, ELF-like semantics, use (just inventing a name here)
<code>HUNK_HEADER_MAS</code> (for <strong>m</strong>ultiple <strong>a</strong>ddress <strong>s</strong>pace support).</p>

<p>Though, honestly, considering Tripos libraries overwhelmingly superior memory savings over ELF-style,
I’m not sure why you’d ever want to.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I’ve shown how one can build a dynamic loader for the <code>a.out</code> format.
It involves adding a few missing fields and pseudo-segments to the file,
but it is not impossible, and it’s patently much simpler than ELF’s current file structure.</p>

<p>I’ve shown how Hunk Format executables <em>already</em> implements the vast majority
of ELF’s more salient features.
It should be noted that Hunk Format predates ELF by almost <em>two decades</em>.
It is possible to retrofit ELF-like behavioral patterns onto Hunk Format,
but it’s not clear to me that this delivers a technical win.
The memory savings one gets with a Tripos-style shared library
is rather significant, even after accounting for instruction set density differences
between processors contemporary in 1978, 1988, and 1998.</p>

<p>The one thing I <em>would</em> consider unconditionally retrofitting onto Hunk Format loaders,
though,
is the use of negative indices to the hunk table to refer to module-local hunks.
It will make life easier for anyone looking to independently upgrade libraries from their clients.
<em>Knowing</em> that your module’s hunks starts at offset 6 in the hunk table
(e.g., as in our clock example above)
seems klunky to me, and to an extent breaches the encapsulation the loader’s intended to provide.
I’ll need to research this further some day.</p>

<p>As well, I would continue to provide mezzanine documentation on conventions to help ameliorate
versioning-related incompatibilities.
This documentation would include, for instance,
<em>how</em> to discover where a library’s jump table resides, etc.
However, these things are complimentary to Tripos-style libraries, and do not replace them.</p>

<p>Personally, I think Unix System V Release 4 would have been a lot better off
if they’d built on top of Hunk Format executables instead of relying on ELF.
There’s definite memory-savings potential from not having everything and their grandmother embedding a symbol table,
the lack of a (or at least a smaller) GOT means programs run faster since fewer indirection is happening all the time,
and, allowing a library to keep shared state across all its clients is a <em>really useful thing to have</em>,
enabling libraries to offer first-class, system-wide services.
While not intending to serve as a complete replacement,
there would be reduced pressure for the use of kernel modules,
which are platform-specific and often with strange interface requirements,
to serve these needs.
This, in turn, would lead to a more modular and robust user-land experience
without sacrificing the architectural benefits that a monolithic kernel can provide.</p>

<p>Anyway, there you have it:
not just one;
but, <strong>two</strong>
technologies which existed at the time ELF was invented,
which with a little bit of thought could have easily subsumed all the use-cases of ELF,
and which didn’t require 186 pages of documentation to describe poorly.
It’s regrettable that neither of these technologies had the weight of AT&amp;T backing them.<sup><a href="#aout">6</a></sup></p>

For a quite compelling argument against this point of view,
please read this collection of quotes against
<a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/dynamic-linking/">dynamic linking in general,</a>
and a uniquely ELF-related concept of

It is interesting that we must give a hunk size for <code>HUNK_BSS</code>,
even though nothing actually follows it.
The authors of Tripos’ loader could have just as easily declared
<code>HUNK_BSS</code> to just be a null hunk, but instead chose an extraneous size word to follow.
Please note, however, that the BSS size specified in the <code>HUNK_HEADER</code> takes priority
over the supplied size in the <code>HUNK_BSS</code> hunk.</p>

<p><a name="reloc32short">3</a>:
Starting with AmigaOS 2.0,
you can also use <code>HUNK_RELOC32SHORT</code> hunks to basically include the exact same information as above,
but more compactly, using 16-bit words instead of 32-bit words.
This is a space saving measure, since most segments for AmigaOS tend to be 64KiB or smaller.</p>

<p><a name="initBss">4</a>:
It is <em>technically</em> illegal to place relocations after a BSS hunk.
I’m not personally aware of any version of AmigaOS which will throw out such a binary, however.
I suppose, if you’re crafty enough, you can use these relocations to pre-load pointers placed in BSS.
I don’t recommend this, for obvious reasons;
your program could well break on any revision of the operating system’s loader.</p>

I think this is one of ELF’s <em>worst</em> features.
A library should <em>always</em> be something that <em>you</em> depend upon;
the library should never have to depend on you.
When the latter happens, you really have a degenerate <em>framework</em>,
and as we all know,

AT&amp;T certainly did have control over the <code>a.out</code> header format for their Unix distributions
prior to their switch to COFF with Unix System V Release 1.
However, looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COFF">Wikipedia article on COFF</a>,
I’m utterly bamboozled as to why AT&amp;T even bothered with it,
when even a little bit of research in the matter
would have shown hunk format to have both existed and to have met most of their needs at the time.
As I’ve illustrated above,
adding a few different hunk types would have added the remaining semantics that it was missing.
For some reason, this <em>never</em> crossed anyone’s mind.
Why?
I can only think that, like so many other computer-related companies at the time,
AT&amp;T Bell Labs suffered dearly from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">Not Invented Here Syndrome.</a></p>
