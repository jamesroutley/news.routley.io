    <h1>Petition to the Open Source Initiative: Publish the Full 2025 Election Results</h1>

<p dir="auto"><strong>We, the undersigned, petition the Open Source Initiative
(OSI) to release the complete, unaltered results of its 2025 Board of
Directors elections</strong>. We believe that by removing candidates and votes
<em>after</em> voting concluded, OSI has damaged its credibility.
We call for transparency as a first step toward repairing
OSI&#39;s integrity and reputation.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-background-context" dir="auto">Background context</h2>
<p dir="auto">OSI relies entirely on community deference and respect
for its authority in promoting Open Source and the
consistent use of the term &#34;Open Source.&#34;</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In 2012, OSI shifted toward operating as a member-driven organization.</li>
<li>Every year since 2013, OSI has held elections where Individual and Affiliate members
vote on directors to represent them.</li>
<li>Although OSI is not legally bound to accept the results,
the elections have been a key part of community and membership engagement,
and OSI has always worked to follow best practices for public elections.</li>
<li>Until 2025, OSI has published the full results of elections.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-2025-election" dir="auto">2025 election</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>In 2025, OSI excluded all votes for three candidates before publishing results.</strong>
The announcement of the
<a href="https://opensource.org/blog/announcing-the-new-directors-of-osi-board" rel="nofollow">altered voting results</a>
did not name the removed candidates, but they were Bentley Hensel,
Bradley Kuhn, and Richard Fontana (incidentally, a former OSI director).</p>
<p dir="auto">Notably, Kuhn and Fontana campaigned on a joint
<a href="https://codeberg.org/OSI-Reform-Platform/platform#readme" rel="nofollow">OSI Reform platform</a>
which included four proposals, the most significant being a call to repeal
the newly-adopted Open Source AI Definition (OSAID).
They also advocated for revising the
<a href="https://opensource.org/board/board-member-agreement" rel="nofollow">OSI Board Member Agreement</a>,
because they interpreted the clause requiring members to &#34;support publicly all Board
decisions&#34; as being overly expansive and stifling. They proposed clarifying or
limiting the clause to achieve a better balance.</p>
<p dir="auto">Normally, as in prior years, as with other organizations, and as stated during
candidate orientation, signing of the Board Agreement would happen only
with the election winners as part of getting seated as new directors.
Kuhn and Fontana say that they brought up their concerns about the Agreement
during candidate orientation and came away with the understanding that they
would be able to discuss how to resolve the issue later if they won the election.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then, <strong>about one hour after voting ended, OSI emailed a <em>new</em> requirement
to the 11 non-incumbent candidates. They gave a 47-hour deadline for all to
sign the board member agreement or be disqualified.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Hensel missed the deadline simply by not checking his email soon enough.
Having no chance to otherwise resolve or discuss their agreement
concerns, Fontana and Kuhn returned signed board member agreements that included
their proposed changes. OSI then published the announcement which
excluded all votes for the three candidates.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-ramifications" dir="auto">Ramifications</h2>
<p dir="auto">In general, changing election rules mid-process and altering vote counts
undermines the integrity of any election.
Results must be published transparently — regardless of whether a
candidate withdraws, dies, or is disqualified for any reason. Once a
candidate appears on the ballot, the only way to respect voters is to
count and report the votes as cast. Presenting altered voting results
<em>misrepresents</em> and disrespects the electorate.</p>
<p dir="auto">Regardless of particular concerns about the Board Agreement, for the
current OSI Board to remove critical candidates while hiding
the voting results presents a clear conflict of interest and invites
community speculation about motives and corruption. As
<a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1014603/ac0cfc0a74755501/" rel="nofollow"><em>LWN</em> OSI election coverage</a>
noted, &#34;a cynical person might conclude that the last-minute
requirement to sign the agreement was to disqualify one or both because
they would have won otherwise; and that the OSI leadership was unwilling
to have even a minority number of board members who might seek to steer
the ship in a different direction.&#34;</p>
<h2 id="user-content-call-for-resolution" dir="auto">Call for resolution</h2>
<p dir="auto">We are community members who care deeply about OSI’s mission.
We want to see OSI governed with integrity and transparency.
This petition does not endorse particular candidates or policy positions.
We believe that everyone should care about transparency regardless of
whether we are supportive, critical, or neutral on the policy concerns
brought up in the election.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>To restore credibility and integrity, we call on OSI to:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Publish the full, unaltered election results.</li>
<li>Credibly recommit to working with the community on all steps necessary to repair lost trust.</li>
</ul>
