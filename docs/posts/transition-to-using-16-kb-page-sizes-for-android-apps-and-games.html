<em>Posted by Mayank Jain – Product Manager and Jomo Fisher – Software Engineer</em></p><h2><span><b>Get ready to upgrade your app&#39;s performance as Android embraces 16 KB memory page sizes</b></span></h2>

<h2>Android’s transition to 16 KB Page size</h2>

<p>Traditionally, Android has operated with the 4 KB memory page size. However many ARM CPUs (the most common processors for Android phones) support the larger 16 KB page size, offering improved performance gains. With Android 15, the Android operating system is page-size-agnostic, allowing devices to run efficiently with either 4 KB or 16 KB page size.</p>

<p>Starting <b><a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/prepare-play-apps-for-devices-with-16kb-page-size.html" target="_blank">November 1st, 2025</a></b>, all new apps and app updates that use native C/C++ code targeting Android 15+ devices submitted to Google Play must support 16 KB page sizes. This is a crucial step towards ensuring your app delivers the best possible performance on the latest Android hardware. Apps without native C/C++ code or dependencies, that just use the Kotlin and Java programming languages, are already compatible, but if you&#39;re using native code, now is the time to act.</p>

<p>This transition to larger 16 KB page sizes translates directly into a better user experience. Devices configured with 16 KB page size can see an overall performance boost of 5-10%. This means <b>faster app launch times</b> (up to 30% for some apps, 3.16% on average), <b>improved battery usage</b> (4.56% reduction in power draw), <b>quicker camera starts</b> (4.48-6.60% faster), and even <b>speedier system boot-ups</b> (around 0.8 seconds faster). While there is a marginal increase in memory use, a faster reclaim path is worth it.</p>

<h2>The native code challenge – and how Android Studio equips you</h2>

<p>If your app uses native C/C++ code from the <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk" target="_blank">Android NDK</a> or relies on SDKs that do, you&#39;ll need to recompile and potentially adjust your code for 16 KB compatibility. The good news? Once your application is updated for the 16 KB page size, the <b>same application binary can run seamlessly on both 4 KB and 16 KB devices</b>.</p>

<p>We’ve created several Android Studio tools and guides that can help you prepare for migrating to using 16 KB page size.</p>

<h2>Detect compatibility issues</h2>

<p><b>APK Analyzer:</b> Easily <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#16-kb-impact" target="_blank">identify</a> if your app contains native libraries by checking for <span>.so</span> files in the <span>lib</span> folder. The APK Analyzer can also visually indicate your app&#39;s 16 KB compatibility. You can then determine and update libraries as needed for 16 KB compliance.</p>
