    <h1>Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div jsname="tx2NYc"><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>In harsh, disconnected, or mobile environments like disaster zones, remote research stations, or long-haul trucking operations, organizations face significant challenges in providing computing capabilities. Previously, organizations with mission-critical workloads lacked access to important cloud and AI capabilities when in demanding edge environments, including those that present unique challenges and requirements.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, we are excited to announce the general availability of Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance, a new configuration of </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud-hosted?hl=en"><span>Google Distributed Cloud</span></a><span> that brings Google’s cloud and AI capabilities to tactical edge environments. The integrated hardware and software solution unlocks real-time local data processing for AI use cases such as object detection, medical imaging analysis, and predictive maintenance for critical infrastructure. The appliance can be conveniently transported in a rugged case or mounted in a rack within customer-specific local operating environments.</span></p>
<p><span>Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance offers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Department of Defense (DoD) Impact Level 5 (IL5) accreditation:</strong><span> The appliance has achieved  Impact Level 5 accreditation, the highest level of security controls and protection required for unclassified, but sensitive information.  The appliance is also designed to meet Impact Level 6 and higher accreditations, and is actively working towards achieving these certifications.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced AI capabilities</strong><span>: Customers can enhance the performance of their mission-critical applications by utilizing built-in AI solutions from the Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance like translation, speech, and optical character recognition (OCR). For instance, they can use OCR and translation features to scan and translate documents written in different languages, making them accessible and understandable for their end users. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rugged and portable design</strong><span>: Built to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including extreme temperatures, shock, and vibration, Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance has a rugged and portable design that meets stringent accreditation requirements like MIL-STD-810H, ensuring reliable operation even in challenging scenarios. Weighing approximately 100lbs, it&#39;s human-portable, making it easy to transport and deploy in various locations.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full isolation</strong><span>: Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance is designed to operate without any connectivity to Google Cloud or the public internet. The appliance remains fully functional in disconnected environments, preserving the security and isolation of the infrastructure, services, and the APIs that it manages. This makes it ideal for processing sensitive data, while meeting strict regulatory, compliance, and sovereignty requirements. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integrated cloud services:   </strong><span>Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance offers both infrastructure-as-a-services (IaaS) features like compute, networking, and storage, and Google Cloud services like data transfer and data analytics technologies. </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data security</strong><span>: </span><span>Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance </span><span>includes robust security features like encryption, data isolation, firewalls, and secure boot to protect sensitive information.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance enables a wide array of use cases for organizations with stringent security requirements, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Disaster response</strong><span>: In the aftermath of a disaster, timely and accurate information is crucial for coordinating relief efforts and saving lives. However, disaster-stricken areas often lack the necessary infrastructure to support traditional communication and data processing systems. As a self-contained, ruggedized device, the Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance can be rapidly deployed to disaster-affected areas, even in the absence of internet connectivity. It comes pre-loaded with essential software and tools for data collection and analysis, enabling immediate response to emergencies. By leveraging the Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance, aid organizations can enhance their disaster response capabilities, improve coordination, and save lives in times of crisis.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Industrial automation</strong><span>: Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance offers an innovative solution for remote equipment monitoring, predictive maintenance, and process optimization in challenging environments at the edge. For instance, in the manufacturing sector, the appliance can be leveraged to track and optimize equipment performance in remote plants, leading to enhanced productivity and minimized downtime.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transportation and logistics</strong><span>: Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance supports the unique demands of fleet management, autonomous vehicles, and real-time logistics optimization. For example, the appliance can facilitate the deployment and operation of autonomous vehicles by enabling the real-time collection, processing, and decision-making, helping autonomous vehicles safely and efficiently navigate complex environments.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Restricted workloads for federal and defense</strong><span>: Google Distributed Cloud&#39;s air-gapped appliance is designed to meet the demands of restricted workloads, such as sensitive data analysis, AI inference and simulations, and intelligence translation, while adhering to security and supporting compliance regulations.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>“Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped appliance will enable the Air Force Rapid Sustainment Office (RSO) to bring the maintenance digital ecosystem to Airmen in austere and forward deployed locations, supporting the Air Force&#39;s agile objectives while prioritizing security and reliability,” said Michael Roquemore, Director of the RSO’s Rapid, Agile, Integrated Capabilities Team. “By delivering a secure and compliant edge compute platform, the RSO can leverage already developed Google-based technologies in both connected cloud and disconnected edge to bring digital innovation to the Service Members wherever they operate.”</span></p>
