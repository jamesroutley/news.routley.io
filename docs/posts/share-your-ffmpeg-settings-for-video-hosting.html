    <h1>Ask HN: Share your FFmpeg settings for video hosting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am working on a website that has video hosting capability. Users can upload video files and i will generate multiple versions with different qualities or just audio, thumbnails and things like that.</p><p>I have chosen the mp4 container because of how widely supported it is. To prevent users having to fetch whole files, i use the fast start option, where the container&#39;s metadata is written at the beginning of the file, instead of at the end.</p><p>Next, I have picked h264 codec because of how widely supported it is. VP8/VP9/AV1/x265/x266 are certainly better but the h264 software encoding is often beating hardware encoding due to highly optimized and time-proven code and supported hardware. And the uploaded videos are already compressed, users won&#39;t be uploading some 8k raw videos where most advanced codes would be useful for preserving &#34;quality&#34;.</p><p>For audio, i have picked opus codec. Seems like good value over others. Not much else to add.</p><p>I run the ffmpeg to convert video with command like this:</p><p>ffmpeg -hide_banner -loglevel error -i input.mp4 -g 52 -c:v h264 -maxrate:v vbr -bufsize vbr -s HxW -c:a libopus -af aformat=channel_layouts=7.1|5.1|stereo -maxrate:a abr -ar 48000 -ac 2 -f mp4 -movflags faststart -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0 output.mp4</p><p>where vbr is video bitrate like 1024k(1mbps), abr is audio bitrate like 190k and HxW is video dimensions in case of resizing.</p><p>I wonder how are folks that handle video encoding process and generate their videos?</p><p>How did you pick your settings, what issues have you encountered and any tips you can share are certainly appreciated.</p><p>Quite a niche segment when it comes to operations and not being merely consumer/customer.</p></div></div></div>
