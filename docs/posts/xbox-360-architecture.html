But while the Xbox 360 might be the flagship of the 7th generation, it will need to fight strongly once Nintendo and Sony take up retail space.</p><p>This new entry of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/">console architecture series</a> will give you an additional perspective of how technology was envisioned during the early naughties, with emphasis on the emerging ‘multi-core’ processor and unorthodox symbiosis between components, all of which enabled engineers to tackle unsolvable challenges with cost-effective solutions.</p><h3 id="highly-recommended-pre-reading">Highly recommended pre-reading</h3><p>The first section of this writing (titled ‘CPU’) makes recurring references to IBM and Sony’s joint venture, Cell. If you don’t know about that component, I highly suggest that you read <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/">my previous article about the PS3</a> beforehand. The latter is written as if the Xbox 360 never existed, this was intentional to avoid confusing the reader with circular references. Hence, the new article completes the timeline by adding Xbox 360 into the mix.</p><p>For those who are already familiar with the PS3’s architecture, I’ve structured this study similar to the PS3 article, so you’ll be able to compare both side-by-side objectively if you choose to do so.</p><h3 id="personal-video-introduction">Personal video introduction</h3><p>Because this article is way longer than my previous ones, I also made a quick video where I (attempt to) present this article and give you an idea of the content you will find. <a href="https://youtu.be/uZXHQT3NRss">You can watch it here</a>. It’s my first ‘personal introduction’ so you’ll have to forgive my occasional fillers :)</p><hr/><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Once again, we find ourselves with a new type of CPU that is unlike anything seen on the store shelves. After all, this is another 7th-generation console that reflects an obsessive need for innovation, a peculiar trait of that era.</p><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><p>Before we discuss the architecture, I’ll start with a bit of history to bring you up to speed. The following paragraphs focus on the business aspect of the Xbox 360’s CPU, whose sequence of events you may find amusing, to say the least.</p><p>I’ll try to keep it short so we can focus on the main topics of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/">this series</a>, but if in the end, you are interested in more, you may enjoy a book called ‘The Race For A New Game Machine’ which is written by the former executives at IBM.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-from-complier-to-ruler-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-from-complier-to-ruler">From complier to ruler</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-sharing-common-problems-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-sharing-common-problems">Sharing common problems</a></li><li id="tab-1-3-resentful-old-friends-link"><a href="#tab-1-3-resentful-old-friends">Resentful old friends</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-from-complier-to-ruler"><h4 id="tab-1-1-from-complier-to-ruler">From complier to ruler</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/e3/start.0693e5a645054cfa38f1e6ab0d7364e720a456c063ec0c054caf60ed9e6e6041.jpg"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="634" height="384" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/e3/start.0693e5a645054cfa38f1e6ab0d7364e720a456c063ec0c054caf60ed9e6e6041.jpg" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>The beginning of Microsoft’s presentation at E3 2005, where Robbie Bach, J Allard and Peter Moore unveiled the Xbox 360 <sup id="bibref:1"><a href="#bib:cpu-microsoft_e3" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></sup>.</figcaption></figure><p>After enjoying the surprising success of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/">original Xbox</a>, it was time for Microsoft to work on the successor. The company started by looking for vendors that could face off against Sony’s upcoming technology, however, unlike their previous development, Microsoft now enjoyed the upper hand in forthcoming negotiations.</p><p>To put things in context, back when the original Xbox project was still at an early stage, neither Intel nor Nvidia were willing to share their intellectual property with Microsoft. This decision limited Microsoft’s capacity to mould Nvidia’s or Intel’s chips for the specific needs of the Xbox.</p><p>For instance, the security subsystem that protected the console against the execution of unauthorised code was implemented outside these two critical chips. This made it vulnerable to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#tab-9-2-bootstrap-search">snooping attacks</a> that eventually paved way for the execution of Homebrew and piracy. Moreover, Microsoft did not control the manufacturing stage either, so the production of Xbox consoles was at the mercy of Intel’s and Nvidia’s supply.</p><p>Well, now that Microsoft gained more leverage in the console market, they weren’t willing to give away those rights anymore.</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-sharing-common-problems"><h4 id="tab-1-2-sharing-common-problems">Sharing common problems</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/cpu/copermine.41f0224e7620c90b4414a9327054d03610823df652ca5ec79d65d07a23fb48d8.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="615" height="377" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/cpu/copermine.41f0224e7620c90b4414a9327054d03610823df652ca5ec79d65d07a23fb48d8.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>The original Xbox’s CPU (2001).

This is what Microsoft had in mind for their next CPU.</figcaption></figure><p>As with any other company in the computer business, the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#tab-1-2-new-design-philosophies">innovation crisis</a> of the early noughties affected both Microsoft and Sony indiscriminately. The difference, however, was that the two placed their bets on different designs for their CPUs. The original Xbox relied on popular off-the-shelf stock (Intel’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#cpu">Pentium III</a>) with slight customisations, this was a single-core CPU extended with vectorised instructions and a sophisticated cache design. On the other side, Sony’s vectorised venture (the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-2/#cpu">Emotion Engine</a>) consisted of a low-end CPU surrounded by proprietary but potent assistants.</p><p>For their new generation, Microsoft settled for a conservative design combined with some experimental ideas. According to their checklist, the new CPU would be <strong>multi-core</strong> (that is, a chip housing many CPU cores in a symmetrical and homogenous layout) and the supplier would have to <strong>share their Intellectual property (IP)</strong> with Microsoft <sup id="bibref:2"><a href="#bib:cpu-takahashi" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></sup>.</p><p>The last condition was as critical as the first, as it would enable the Xbox team to <strong>bundle a security system inside the chip</strong> (which, unlike the original Xbox, would be properly shielded). Furthermore, the IP rights would grant Microsoft a choice of <strong>third-party manufacturers</strong> to handle demand and negotiate better costs, resulting in a new console with competitive pricing.</p><p>Thus, Microsoft began meeting with Intel, though the talks didn’t last long, as Intel wasn’t willing to give out its secret recipe. So, Microsoft kept looking.</p></div><div id="tab-1-3-resentful-old-friends"><h4 id="tab-1-3-resentful-old-friends">Resentful old friends</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/photos/ibm_pc.b3f6aed9e7f8e6070c5a67ee9613bc4753485a0c238c1b0d940e6625d27904ec.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/photos/_hu0f7de9e5919af40f99047ac51c9ba689_124048_c4cc2fd8a91726218c35753ddf167946.webp 500w,

For some reason, they don’t allow to use it…</figcaption></figure><p>It so happened that one of the potential candidates for Microsoft was none other than IBM. Maybe I watched too many dramatic documentaries, but I always pictured the two as the kind of passive-aggressive ‘friends’ who only smile at each other if they are among other people.</p><p>You see, in the past, IBM and Microsoft formed many partnerships that ended up with bitterness between the two. Be as it may, their agreements ended up disrupting the status quo of the global market and paved the way for new types of consumer products and developments. To name a few examples:</p><ul><li>The arrival of the IBM <strong>Personal Computer</strong> in 1981 led to a new market of ‘personal computers’ and the subsequent choice of Microsoft’s ‘MS-DOS’ as the default operating system. This granted Microsoft a monopolistic dominance in the PC business in the years to come.</li><li>In the 90s, with the advent of home networking and affordable servers and workstations, IBM and Microsoft’s new venture resulted in <strong>OS/2</strong>, a new operating system targeting high-end IBM computers. However, upon the unexpected release of Microsoft’s Windows NT, IBM was left alone to fight in an arena already favouring Windows.</li></ul><p>By the turn of the century, IBM returned its attention to in-house products, including a partnership with Apple and Motorola that resulted in a series of CPUs with a unique architecture called <strong>PowerPC</strong>.</p><p>When Microsoft approached IBM for a new <em>frictionless</em> venture, IBM was already working with Toshiba and Sony to create a superior PowerPC processor for scientific applications. Nevertheless, IBM was open to new business opportunities.</p></div></div></div><h4 id="the-new-cpu-partner">The new CPU partner</h4><p>In a turn of events, IBM agreed to share its IP and to design a new multi-core processor, and so the <strong>Xbox 360’s CPU supplier became IBM</strong>. Although, <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#tab-1-1-the-state-of-progress">you may remember</a> this was the same IBM that already signed an agreement with Sony and Toshiba to produce the Playstation’s 3 CPU (‘Cell’). Apparently, IBM assumed Microsoft was not aware of the Cell project <sup id="bibref:3"><a href="#bib:cpu-alexander" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></sup> and their current contract with Sony didn’t forbid them to sell to third parties.</p><blockquote><p>All three companies [IBM, Toshiba and Sony]… legally all had rights to go and put any of that technology, any of those processor cores into other spaces. (…) It is very common to develop an interesting, leading-edge new technology and then utilize that technology across multiple platforms. (…) I guess what everyone didn’t anticipate was – before we even got done with the Cell chip and PS3 product – that <strong>we’d be showing this off specifically to a competitor</strong>. <sup id="bibref:4"><a href="#bib:cpu-alexander" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></sup></p><p>– <cite>David Shippy, chief architect of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#the-powerpc-processing-unit">Power Processing Unit</a> (PPU)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Ironically, as of 2022, IBM’s PowerPC chips have vanished from both desktop computers and video consoles, maybe this set a bad precedent and greatly affected IBM’s trust in future businesses? I’m afraid I don’t know the answer to that.</p><p>To sum it up, IBM signed an agreement with Sony and Toshiba to develop Cell in 2001. Two years later, in 2003, IBM agreed to supply Microsoft with a new low-powered multi-core CPU. Microsoft’s CPU will be called <strong>Xenon</strong> and will inherit part of Cell’s technology, with extra input from Microsoft (focusing on multi-core homogenous computing and bespoke security). Also, while IBM would brand Cell with its ‘BladeCenter’ line of servers, Xenon could only be fitted on an Xbox 360 motherboard.</p><h3 id="cells-half-sibling">Cell’s half-sibling</h3><p>Now that we positioned Microsoft and IBM in the map, let’s talk about the new CPU. This is how Xenon materialised at the end of the Xbox 360 project:</p><figure><ul><li id="tab-2-1-xenon-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-xenon">Xenon</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-cell-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-cell">Cell</a></li></ul><figure id="tab-2-1-xenon"><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/cpu/xenon.de0a90f4521b53307e318b90d73e1b63d630ad73ffd65413058507c99aa11485.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="588" height="452" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/cpu/xenon.de0a90f4521b53307e318b90d73e1b63d630ad73ffd65413058507c99aa11485.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Simplified view of Xenon.</figcaption></figure><figure id="tab-2-2-cell"><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps3/cpu/cell.718486ccb87b81d79187ea4d73d3253782500d56b61089a22c66a06fede2218b.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="587" height="452" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps3/cpu/cell.718486ccb87b81d79187ea4d73d3253782500d56b61089a22c66a06fede2218b.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>A diagram of Cell for comparison purposes.</figcaption></figure></figure><p>Don’t worry, all of these components will be explained throughout this article, starting with the ‘PPE’ blocks shown at the top left corner.</p><h4 id="a-new-look-at-cpu-history">A new look at CPU history</h4><p>The Cell project, with its obsession with vectorised computations, introduced very interesting proposals to radically tackle the ongoing constraints that hindered technological progress. These constraints, however, are very complex. So it wouldn’t be fair to say that Cell’s methods were the only -or even best- solution. In other words, by studying Xenon’s architecture (which competed side-by-side with Cell’s) we can gain a different perspective on how CPU architecture evolved throughout that era (the early 00s) and subsequently influenced the next decade of CPUs.</p><div><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/photos/xenon.7e84726871d1c946ac2933fae340b8184ec19b90f0e0342e1399789f5c056602.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/photos/_hub187ad49597351f7f7912df8911cf936_83118_0490d63e3611966def28e22cbcea103f.webp 500w,

Additionally, <strong>the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#inside-cell-the-assistants">Synergic Processors Units (SPUs)</a> are no more</strong>.</p><p>After all, Microsoft didn’t want processors of very different nature squashed in their CPU. They instructed IBM to compose three powerful cores and enhance them with the ingredients game developers would expect to find. With this approach, IBM and Microsoft were also able to add non-standard features without disrupting the traditional <em>modus operandi</em> of developers.</p></div><p>Truth to be told, this also resulted in aggressive budget cuts to keep this design (and the rest of the system) at a competitive price range. To put it in context, multi-core CPUs for PCs weren’t on the store shelves while IBM was building Xenon, and when they debuted in 2005 (coincidentally, the same year the Xbox 360 reached the stores), AMD priced their cheapest Athlon X2 at $537 (equivalent to ~£452 in 2021 money) and Intel charged $241 (equivalent to ~£203 in 2021 money) for their low-end Pentium D <sup id="bibref:5"><a href="#bib:cpu-hachman" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></sup> - and let’s not forget the box only included the CPU.</p><h3 id="how-this-study-is-organised">How this study is organised</h3><p>We’ll now take a look main components that comprise Sony’s counterpart.

Additionally, since we’ve got three of them now, it may seem as if the whole chip behaves like a <em>Ceberus</em> monster, where each core may claim control of the whole system. Alas, that’s not feasible in a computer, so the first core is the designated <strong>master core</strong> while the others will be taking <strong>assistant roles</strong>.</li><li>A <strong>single interface</strong> that interconnects the cores with the rest of the system.

With the Xbox 360, Xenon only accommodates three units (the three PPEs), so the EIB has no purpose here.

This may appear more optimal than the token topology of the EIB, but that’s because the XBAR only needs to serve a small number of nodes.

Well, the XBAR is just one piece of the sizeable chunk IBM designed for Xenon. It turns out the leftover space gave them room to incorporate another very important block that speeds up the transactions between the PPEs and the rest of the system: <strong>L2 Cache</strong>.</p><p>Once the PPEs pass through the XBAR, they get access to <strong>1 MB worth of L2 cache</strong>. The L2 block is also connected in a meshed manner, where each PPE gets a separate <strong>256-bit bus</strong> but is now clocked at <strong>1.6 GHz</strong> (half the PPEs’ speed) <sup id="bibref:7"><a href="#bib:cpu-brown" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></sup>.</p><p>Coincidentally, Cell also houses <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#composition-of-the-ppe">512 KB of L2 cache</a> for its single PPE. I only described it in one sentence in my previous article. Now, however, we find ourselves with a larger space that’s also shared between three cores, so I find it necessary to dive into the properties of the L2 block so we can understand how it will condition the performance of the PPEs.</p><p>First things first, every time the cache fetches data from memory (in the event of a ‘cache miss’), it does so by pulling a large slice called ‘cache line’, this is <strong>128 Bytes wide</strong> in the case of Cell and Xenon. Then, L2 records the cache line on an internal list for locating it in the future. Moreover, in Xenon/Cell, L2 is <strong>8-way associative</strong>, which means that cache sets may store up to eight different cache lines. Don’t worry if you don’t know what this means, the theory behind CPU cache can be hard to follow, especially if you only want to learn about videogame consoles. In layman’s terms, the greater the number of associations, the fewer probabilities of cache misses, but the slower it becomes to iterate through the internal list.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/cpu/caches.9ddadcc525314e563beb787136b4fa9b3397b97a1610b3c15aa1825e4a926d8a.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="927" height="477" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/cpu/caches.9ddadcc525314e563beb787136b4fa9b3397b97a1610b3c15aa1825e4a926d8a.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Layout of cache in Xenon</figcaption></figure><p>The choice of an 8-way associative cache was not a rash decision for Xenon, as providing eight associations can alleviate the six simultaneous threads (each PPE is dual-threaded) trying to access the L2 block at the same time. This also balances frequent cache misses and lookup times. All of this, while keeping the costs down. For comparison purposes, the expensive Intel’s ‘Smithfield’ (a Pentium D from 2005) provides two cores with 2 MB of L2 cache each! <sup id="bibref:8"><a href="#bib:cpu-shimpi_intel" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></sup></p><p>It wouldn’t be the first time Microsoft <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#tab-1-5-the-core">trimmed the cache for pricing purposes</a>, so it will be up to developers to optimise its usage. To assist with this, XBAR bundles additional logic like ‘Cache locking’ which will be further explained in the ‘Graphics’ section.</p><h3 id="inside-xenon-the-leaders">Inside Xenon: The leader(s)</h3><p>This is as far as we go with our description of the XBAR and L2 cache, let’s now talk about the actual CPU.

In a nutshell, IBM boosted the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#tab-3-3-arithmetic">VMX unit</a> (the SIMD block found within the PPEs) which evolved into <strong>VMX128</strong>, now housing more registers and opcodes.</p><p>The initial VMX specification implemented in the Playstation 3 provides 32 128-bit registers and instructions for operating up to three 32-bit scalars. This worked to an acceptable degree with general-purpose applications that depend on SIMD operations, although the real performance would be unlocked once the SPEs are added into the equation. By contrast, Microsoft wanted programmers to port SIMD-hungry applications without extra hassle, and the new VMX128 unit reflects that.</p><p>VMX128 supplies <strong>128 128-bit</strong> registers instead, along with an adapted instruction set to manipulate the larger set of registers. To accomplish that, IBM changed the opcode format to allocate 7 bits (as opposed to 5 bits) for referencing its extended register file <sup id="bibref:10"><a href="#bib:cpu-gschwind" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></sup>. This is possible thanks to some trickery applied on the last five bits at the end of the 32-bit opcode <sup id="bibref:11"><a href="#bib:cpu-biallas" role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></sup>. The last five bits are mostly, but not completely, unused by VMX. Consequently, VMX128 is incompatible with a subset of VMX instructions (related to integer multiplication and additions).</p><p>Furthermore, VMX128 adds new instructions that compute the <strong>dot product</strong> of two vectors composed of up to three 32-bit floating-point numbers; and others that handle <strong>Direct3D’s data compression formats</strong> <sup id="bibref:12"><a href="#bib:cpu-brown" role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></sup> (it’s worth mentioning that DirectX is the de-facto API for programming this console). Finally, thanks to the symmetric design of Xenon and its multi-threaded model (dual-issuing), VMX128’s register file is duplicated, so there are <strong>256 128-bit registers per core</strong>!</p><p>As we reach the end of this section, there’s still one question left unanswered: which is faster for vector operations, 1 VMX + 6 SPEs (as in the PS3) or 3 VMX128 units (as in the Xbox 360)? Well, their designs are too divergent, so it’s hard to quantify. One could say ‘The SPE can execute up to two instructions per cycle while Xenon takes 12 cycles to add two vectors (due to the long pipeline of the PPE)’ but that’s relative, as the SPE’s memory scope is restricted to its local memory (requiring DMA calls to interact with the outside), while Xenon’s PPEs can access any memory location. So, in conclusion, these are two contrasting models and programmers will just have to get the best out of them.</p><h4 id="a-new-but-short-lived-instruction">A new but short-lived instruction</h4><p>With the advent of a larger cache system, Microsoft and IBM extended the PowerPC instruction set to accommodate some instructions that operate these blocks from the program side, in case programmers wish to make manual interventions (such as caching data ahead of time or saving L2 space). In any case, the standard PowerPC specification already provides the <code>dcbt</code> (‘Data Cache Block Touch’) instruction to fetch data from memory into the L1 cache (individual for each core) <sup id="bibref:13"><a href="#bib:cpu-ppcvema" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></sup>. Nonetheless, Microsoft took a step forward and added <code>xdcbt</code> (‘Extended Data Cache Block Touch’) to fill the L1 cache without even going through L2 (shared across all cores) <sup id="bibref:14"><a href="#bib:cpu-lanterman" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></sup>. This makes sense as the shared L2 is a new addition of Xenon. However, bypassing L2 is a risky operation as two cores may end up seeing different data (cache incoherency), so it will require correct handling from the program side to keep cache incoherency and race conditions out of the way.</p><p>As luck would have it, <code>xdcbt</code> worked fine until Microsoft started receiving error reports from game studios <sup id="bibref:15"><a href="#bib:cpu-dawson" role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></sup>. Initially, Microsoft relied on this instruction for common routines available through their API (such as <code>memcpy()</code>) but they didn’t account for the consequent lack of cache coherence. Thus, uses of <code>xdcbt</code> were subsequently removed from their APIs. Yet, studios found a bigger problem: branching instructions followed up by <code>xdcbt</code> always execute the latter. It turns out the branch predictor will attempt to execute <code>xdcbt</code> (as any other instruction that may be <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#features">undone</a> later on, if the prediction turns out to be incorrect) with the exception that once the cache blocks are mangled, there’s no way to undo it (becoming a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#delay-galore">hazard</a>). Thus, the program will not synchronise the caches as it assumes <code>xdcbt</code> hasn’t been triggered, leaving the PPEs in a disarrayed state.</p><p>In the end, Microsoft purged <code>xdcbt</code> from the compiler due to its non-deterministic (thus unpredictable) behaviour, and what’s left of it was just an anecdote.</p><h4 id="revisiting-old-paradigms">Revisiting old paradigms</h4><p>There’s a recurring subject found in noteworthy writings from 2005 like ‘Inside the Xbox 360’ by Jon Stokes <sup id="bibref:16"><a href="#bib:cpu-stokes" role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></sup> or ‘Understanding the Cell Microprocessor’ by Anand Lal Shimpi <sup id="bibref:17"><a href="#bib:cpu-shimpi" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></sup>, and that is the <strong>lack of out-of-order execution</strong> that once debuted in early PowerPC chips like Gekko, but for some reason is completely absent in Cell &amp; Xenon. If you recall from the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#features">Gamecube article</a> (which I wrote it two years ago), Gekko is an out-of-order CPU, meaning it’s able to analyse the instruction stream as instructions come in, and subsequently re-order them to better distribute the load of Gekko’s internal units.</p><p>By then, CPU cores employing out-of-order execution were in the order of the day (<em>pun intended</em>). IBM’s PowerPC 604 (1994) brought it to high-end Macintosh computers, Intel’s P6 (1995) introduced it to the x86 line and MIPS implemented it with the R10000 (1996) CPU, a successor of the R4000 (found on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/#cpu">Nintendo 64</a>). Afterwards, all of a sudden, Cell and Xenon arrive with an in-order execution style… <em>care to explain</em>?</p><p>To understand this turn of events, let’s take a closer look at the Out-of-order execution (OoO) model. OoO is not a Lego piece that engineers fit and then move on to the next part. Pipelined CPUs are susceptible to a whole new range of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#delay-galore">hazards</a>, which means that the slightest addition may lead to a complete redesign. For instance, OoO requires altering the register file to fit <strong>register renaming</strong> <sup id="bibref:18"><a href="#bib:cpu-etsion" role="doc-biblioref">[18]</a></sup>, a clever technique where the CPU houses more registers than the instruction set references, enabling the CPU to store multiple copies of the program state and prevent dependency problems that arise after altering the original order of the instructions. All in all, while these solutions are interesting, they add up to complexity to the CPU chip, and that can pose a threat to future scalability.</p><p>The PowerPC Processor Element (PPE) derives from POWER4 which is itself an OoO core. However, POWER4 is an independent chip by itself, while the PPE is either surrounded by 7 SPEs (as with the Playstation 3/Cell) or by two more PPEs (as with the Xbox 360/Xenon). These changes take up space and the dimensions of the CPU chip are critical in terms of price and heat emission. So, in the end, I imagine IBM didn’t see enough advantages for applying OoO on an application-specific machine like the PS3 or Xbox 360.</p><h5 id="an-alternative-solution">An alternative solution</h5><p>Look at it this way, why was OoO invented in the first place? To prevent the CPU from idling (as idling = wasted resources). So, will the applications (3D gaming) be prone to this issue? Maybe, but it’s also true that OoO is not the only possible solution to this problem! Introducing <strong>Thread level parallelism</strong> (TLP).</p><p>What if instead of sorting out which instructions should be executed first, we duplicate the resources into two (or more) groups called ‘threads’ and let the program switch between the different groups of resources (multi-threading) as it sees more fit. This is what IBM’s engineers went for, hence the reason the PPE is <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#tab-3-1-instructions">dual-issued</a>. The new technique, called <strong>Thread level parallelism</strong> (TLP), differentiates itself from <strong>Instruction level parallelism</strong> (ILP) by letting the program, as opposed to the CPU, to come up with its own solution. With Xenon and Cell, it’s now left to the compiler and the program’s multi-threading implementation to produce an efficient sequence of instructions.</p><p>The interesting thing is that neither approach is better or worse, out-of-order processors are still found in the market (Intel/AMD still support OoO along with an obscene amount of other techniques, while ARM adopted OoO with the Cortex-A8 in 2005). On top of that, those CPUs have multi-threaded cores and even bundle multiple cores within the same chip, so you get a mix of both techniques (TLP and ILP).</p><h3 id="inside-xenon-main-memory">Inside Xenon: Main Memory</h3><p>Unlike its competitor equipped with <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#outside-cell-main-memory">256 MB of XDR DRAM</a>, there’s 0 MB of external memory installed next to Xenon. That’s right, a 100% decrease compared to the Japanese counterpart.</p><p>Ok… let me rephrase that. On the motherboard, multiple chips provide a total of <strong>512 MB of GDDR3 SDRAM</strong>, but they are sitting next to the GPU, <strong>not the CPU</strong>. So… you probably guessed it. Just like the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#memory-layout">original Xbox</a>, Microsoft went for the <strong>Unified Memory Architecture</strong> (UMA) layout, where all components share the same RAM chips. This provides more flexibility in the amount of memory reserved for the CPU or GPU. However, a single point of access for various components means the far away components (like the CPU) will suffer higher latency compared to the hypothetical case where the CPU was given dedicated memory. This was duly noted by IBM and Microsoft engineers and subsequently tackled with the aforementioned L2 cache along with extra circuitry (which is explained in the ‘Graphics’ section).</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/photos/mem_path.5dafed8cc94370518c4d86e327c9f37529ab2c6d35e4e261292c89e79c7d4080.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/photos/_hu8042af54c152adf18d1c9176e8a695a1_104610_4e74da9e058a6066b7ee77cbe1ee1e85.webp 500w,

Conversely, the Xbox 360 gets the crown for including the largest amount. In fact, it’s been reported that Microsoft <strong>initially planned to house 256 MB</strong>, but later doubled the amount out of fear for Sony’s upcoming competitor <sup id="bibref:19"><a href="#bib:cpu-takahashi" role="doc-biblioref">[19]</a></sup>. Though, unlike Sony, Microsoft was extra sensible with the retail price, so it had to cut down on other features. That’s why the <strong>hard drive was made optional</strong>. Furthermore, Microsoft expected Samsung (its memory supplier) to deliver their chips operating at 1.4 GHz but then settled for <strong>700 MHz</strong> at the time of shipping the console.</p><h4 id="memory-controller">Memory Controller</h4><p>With all being said, how can Xenon access this memory? Well, the CPU communicates with the GPU through an interface called <strong>Front-side Bus</strong> that uses two unidirectional buses, the ‘CPU→GPU’ lane is <strong>64 bits wide and runs at 1.35 GHz</strong>, while the ‘GPU→CPU’ one is <strong>128-bits wide and runs at 675 MHz</strong> <sup id="bibref:20"><a href="#bib:cpu-brown" role="doc-biblioref">[20]</a></sup>. If we do the math, both lanes provide a bandwidth of 10.8 GB/s.</p><p>The Front-side bus route only takes you to the GPU. So, between the GPU and the GDDR3 chips, <strong>two memory controllers</strong> inside the GPU manage this connection using <strong>one 1024-bit bus each</strong>. To reduce latency, the memory controllers use <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#tab-8-5-pixel-operations">address tiling</a> for GPU-related operations and path-finding to reduce CPU congestion. In general terms, Microsoft states that there’s a bandwidth of <strong>22.4 GB/s</strong> between GPU and memory.</p><p>It’s all jolly on paper, but let’s not forget that the CPU still has to walk a long road to get to memory. To give you an idea, if you grab PIX (the CPU profiler included with the SDK) and run the sample tests that come with the utility, you’ll see that for every cache miss, the CPU spends <strong>~600 cycles</strong> to get to memory! This is one of the <em>features</em> of UMA-based systems you don’t see marketed very often :), but also helps you understand why cache is so critical.</p><h3 id="inside-xenon-programming-styles">Inside Xenon: Programming styles</h3><p>With all being said, how can anybody take advantage of this <em>fascinating</em> chip? Well, there’s only one way: Multi-threading.</p><p>From the programming perspective, a CPU that’s made of multiple homogenous cores sharing the same memory is what we call a <strong>Symmetric Multi-Processing</strong> (SMP) design. This conditions how the application will be designed and implemented. As of 2022, this is the de-facto layout for consumer multi-core CPUs (i.e. x86 and ARM) as well.</p><p>SMP programming abstracts access to physical CPU cores with the use of ‘virtual threads’. A virtual thread is a sequence of instructions the programmer defines. Threads can then be submitted to a ‘scheduler’ for their execution. The scheduler is another program (often part of the operating system) that handles how virtual threads are dispatched to the physical CPU cores.</p><p>This abstraction layer allows the programmer to avoid discriminating the type of core used (therefore making the program <strong>cross-compatible</strong> with similar platforms) and hardcoding the number of cores (making it <strong>scalable</strong>).</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/cpu/programming.40f620e3b867a85d7c4a3c973835cdfe70aa9ef30d237c7b17b9ae99e5e14ab7.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="795" height="527" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/cpu/programming.40f620e3b867a85d7c4a3c973835cdfe70aa9ef30d237c7b17b9ae99e5e14ab7.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Representation of the multi-threading paradigm on Xenon.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s no surprise that this style became a standard in future console generations, as it’s easier to scale and program with symmetric systems than asymmetric ones (i.e. Cell).

By then, ATI was competing in the PC arena with their ‘ATI Rage’ graphics cards and will soon inherit Flipper’s engineers.

Later on, thanks to SGIs innovations, workloads were offloaded from the CPU thanks to the new <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/#graphics">programmable vertex pipelines</a>. Finally, the ‘mere rasterizer’ definition was <em>rendered</em> obsolete (<em>pun intended</em>) as Nvidia promoted a new stage called <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#graphics">programmable pixel shader</a> which gave programmers the liberty to control what happens after rasterization.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/traditional_pipeline.50d42c7474d0769604f22bcd6c35cbc94e9af3eaf14f5545c1bdd7589a96dc97.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="887" height="197" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/traditional_pipeline.50d42c7474d0769604f22bcd6c35cbc94e9af3eaf14f5545c1bdd7589a96dc97.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the units that compose a GPU with programmable shaders.</figcaption></figure><p>This pattern shows us that, as GPUs grow in performance and functionality, they eventually open up to allow developers to implement the exact functionality they seek. However, this also increases the overall complexity of the silicon.</p><p>Over the years, both vertex and pixel pipelines kept enlarging to accommodate current needs, with new scalability problems emerging. Space, costs and heat emissions have a limit. So, which tasks should be prioritised? vertex operations or pixel effects? A weak vertex pipeline will stall the pixel pipeline. Alternatively, a disappointing pixel unit won’t attract users with its dully-composed frames.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/unified_pipeline.9ffa8dc5f3ab1aa7d99e3759ef3dc311bb18f848eb5987fe1f57a7c849cc20d7.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="887" height="197" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/unified_pipeline.9ffa8dc5f3ab1aa7d99e3759ef3dc311bb18f848eb5987fe1f57a7c849cc20d7.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the units that compose a GPU with a new unified pipeline.</figcaption></figure><p>Thus, architects at ATI took two steps back and asked themselves ‘Is there any way to simplify this model instead of adding more transistors on top of it?’ which later became ‘Why are pixel and vertex pipelines segregated?’. And so, the two stages were ultimately <strong>merged</strong> into a single -unified- block of circuitry. This is what we call the <strong>Unified shader model</strong> and a GPU implementing it still provides both programmable vertex and pixel pipelines, but the circuitry used for computations is shared.</p><p>The new model has two primary benefits: a more <strong>balanced scaling</strong> (as it will now improve both pixel and vertex pipelines to the same degree), and programmers can now develop shader programs that <strong>are not constrained</strong> by the limitations of an individual pipeline type. Though the latter will require major changes in the API to standardise its behaviour and availability, which won’t arrive until 2006 with DirectX 10 or in 2010 with OpenGL 3.3.</p><p>Suffice to say that the unifier shader model is now another standard in the graphics industry.</p><h3 id="architecture-of-xenos">Architecture of Xenos</h3><p>To construct Xenos, ATI borrowed material already present in their consumer products. Though it’s hard to say which existing card they based Xenos on. Wikipedia pairs it with the ‘R520’ core (found in the Radeon x1800) <sup id="bibref:24"><a href="#bib:graphics-wiki_xenos" role="doc-biblioref">[24]</a></sup>, though I find it hard to believe as the R520 contains fundamental differences (related to the new unified architecture) that make me doubt about such relation. In the absence of any reliable source, I turned to the Xenia emulator Discord where I luckily received a lot of input from the community, especially TriΔng3l, who works in emulating Xenos.</p><p>In essence, Xenos is based on R400 (also known as ‘Crayola’), a new architecture from the ground up that never materialised in the form of a consumer card (except Xenos, being the only incarnation to this day). Instead, ATI shipped R500-based cards to PC users, which are a continuation of the R300 architecture. Curiously enough, some R520 cards incorporated part of Crayola’s technology, but were marketed as ‘ATI Avivo’ and only used for accelerating video decoding.</p><p>In the end, ATI brought the unified shader model to the masses through their new R600 architecture (an evolution of R400), also known as ‘TeraScale’, released in 2007 with the Radeon HD 2000. And the rest is history.</p><p>Interestingly enough, the R400 branch carried on in the smartphone world with the ATI Imageon Z430 <sup id="bibref:25"><a href="#bib:graphics-nopixel" role="doc-biblioref">[25]</a></sup>, later called Qualcom Adreno 200, which also went through many iterations. This is another example of innovative technology that finds its way into the mobile market!</p><h3 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h3><p>Another unusual element from Xenos is its <strong>triple memory architecture</strong> (so much for emphasising the UMA…). Xenos relies on two different chips to render graphics, one is the <strong>aforementioned 512 MB of GDDR3 DRAM</strong> (which is shared with the CPU) and the other is a smaller but way faster memory chip residing within the same package (which only Xenos has access too). The latter piece provides <strong>10 MB of Embedded Dynamic RAM</strong> (EDRAM) <sup id="bibref:26"><a href="#bib:graphics-baumann" role="doc-biblioref">[26]</a></sup>. Curiously enough, EDRAM is not a new ingredient, having been found in the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-2/#graphics">Graphics Synthesiser</a>, the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/#graphics">Graphics Engine</a> and, most importantly, <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#graphics">Flipper</a> (also ATI’s invention).</p><p>Those 512 MB store most - if not all - the materials Xenos needs to render a frame, including textures, shaders and many types of buffers as the game sees fit. On the other side, the 10 MB of EDRAM are left for small elements that require rapid access, such as the Z-buffer, the stencil buffer, the back buffer (intermediate frame buffer) and any other custom buffer if needed. This mitigates congestion from the shared GDDR3 RAM and speeds up operations that make use of those buffers.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/content.0249d54e32907136c7ef4b159f8f1ad08156abe7a4278bbc691983a5961f1945.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="915" height="621" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/content.0249d54e32907136c7ef4b159f8f1ad08156abe7a4278bbc691983a5961f1945.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Example of how data is organised across the memory available</figcaption></figure><p>As if this wasn’t enough, there’s a third source that can feed the GPU, and that is a <strong>direct line to the CPU</strong>! Unlike anything seen before, the CPU can stream commands and geometry without going through the traditional steps of storing <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#tab-4-1-commands">command buffers</a> in external memory, thereby saving once again traffic from main RAM. This is what Microsoft advertised as <strong>Procedural Synthesis</strong> (XPS) and made possible by two changes <sup id="bibref:27"><a href="#bib:cpu-andrews" role="doc-biblioref">[27]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>Firstly, the CPU’s front-side bus was adapted so the GPU can directly fetch data from the CPU’s L2 cache (where the CPU may <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-2/#infinite-worlds">procedurally generate</a> the geometry) in blocks of <strong>128 Bytes</strong> (the size of a cache line).</li><li>Secondly, a separate cached location was added into Xenon so the GPU can notify its current state to the CPU as fast as possible. Microsoft calls it the <strong>Tail pointer write-back</strong> and keeps both components in sync while the CPU updates the L2 cache and the GPU pulls from it. According to Microsoft, this routine provides a theoretical bandwidth of 18 GB/sec <sup id="bibref:28"><a href="#bib:cpu-andrews" role="doc-biblioref">[28]</a></sup>.</li></ul><p>Overall, this synergy is what has enabled the Xbox 360 to achieve such a high level of performance without requiring overpriced hardware.</p><h3 id="constructing-the-frame">Constructing the frame</h3><p>Having said all that, how does Xenon actually render a frame? Well, similarly to other GPUs in the market, there are many steps involved. Take a look at this diagram of Xenos’ pipeline:</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/pipeline.9fd85ad1c2123bdb8ad91a9948fa159a2e236e70a9c3293fdc32c633ea8611ea.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="773" height="417" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/pipeline.9fd85ad1c2123bdb8ad91a9948fa159a2e236e70a9c3293fdc32c633ea8611ea.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the graphics pipeline in Xenos.</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, the pipeline stages are not different at all compared to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#graphics">other graphics chips</a> that don’t employ the unified shader model. This is because the actual change happens at the <strong>circuitry level</strong> and not at the API level (for now). This way, developers are not forced to learn new techniques that will disrupt their traditional methods, but they’ll soon find that the new underlying design will benefit them in terms of performance and extra functionality (on top of the ‘traditional’ one).</p><p>Conversely, this GPU is strongly aligned to a proprietary API developed by Microsoft called <strong>Direct3D 9</strong>. This API has enjoyed increasing adoption in the PC market due to its wide compatibility rate with off-the-shelf graphics cards, making the job of game developers a bit more enjoyable. And even though Xenos will also expose some behaviour not seen in the off-the-shelf market, Direct3D is the only high-level API that Microsoft provided to talk to Xenos. So, what we find in the Xbox 360 is a semi-customised version of Direct3D 9 that makes room for the extra functions of Xenos. Curiously enough, Direct3D influenced the design of Xenos in the same way Xenos influenced future revisions of Direct3D (starting with version 10).</p><p>Now it’s time to make a full dive and see how this pipeline works, just like we did in the other articles.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-6-1-commands-link"><a href="#tab-6-1-commands">Commands</a></li><li id="tab-6-2-vertex-shader-link"><a href="#tab-6-2-vertex-shader">Vertex Shader</a></li><li id="tab-6-3-rasterization-link"><a href="#tab-6-3-rasterization">Rasterization</a></li><li id="tab-6-4-pixel-shader-link"><a href="#tab-6-4-pixel-shader">Pixel Shader</a></li><li id="tab-6-5-pixel-operations-link"><a href="#tab-6-5-pixel-operations">Pixel Operations</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-6-1-commands"><h4 id="tab-6-1-commands">Commands</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/pipeline_commands.c92d5ca5cab849fdcfb6472bb71cf02f3db198224e8bd0437a2da8c5ec6498ad.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="549" height="392" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/pipeline_commands.c92d5ca5cab849fdcfb6472bb71cf02f3db198224e8bd0437a2da8c5ec6498ad.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the command stage</figcaption></figure><p>Welcome to the tour of the <em>12th polygon factory</em> of this series. As always, the starting point is the <strong>command stage</strong>. Commands tell the GPU what, where and how to draw something on the screen. This time, however, commands may be <strong>stored in Main Memory</strong> (within a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#tab-1-1-database">buffer</a>) or <strong>directly streamed</strong> by the CPU. Both are subsequently fetched by the <strong>Command Processor</strong> <sup id="bibref:29"><a href="#bib:graphics-ati_review" role="doc-biblioref">[29]</a></sup>, which parses it and forwards it to the respective unit that performs the required operations (as commands may encode different types of instructions, such as ‘draw a triangle’ or ‘set X register’).</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that by this generation, the traditional practice of using <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/#tab-1-1-reality-signal-processor">Display Lists</a> for composing commands has been long superseded by a new structure called <strong>Command Buffer</strong> (as OpenGL and Direct3D call it). While both terms sound similar, the new entity makes room for new operations that weren’t originally envisioned when Display Lists were conceived (primarily related to vertex, pixels and GPU control). As the APIs evolve, Command Buffers are adapted to reflect modern needs, while Display Lists have been deprecated since 2008 (OpenGL removed them with OpenGL 3.2) <sup id="bibref:30"><a href="#bib:graphics-opengl_history" role="doc-biblioref">[30]</a></sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, Direct 3D 9’s command buffers (found in the official SDK of the Xbox 360) provide the option to embed an interesting data format called <strong>Index Buffers</strong>. This enables developers to reuse existing vertex points to avoid duplicating geometry data in memory <sup id="bibref:31"><a href="#bib:graphics-indexbuffer" role="doc-biblioref">[31]</a></sup>.</p><p>Finally, this GPU can also conditionally execute commands depending on arbitrary conditions set by the developers.

You’ll soon find that this stage and the pixel stage are not <em>that</em> different.</figcaption></figure><p>Since the times of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#graphics">Flipper</a> (or even the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/#graphics">RCP</a>, as it shared its core team members), ATI maintained the initiative of providing a geometry block to accelerate vertex operations. With Xenos, it is now fully programmable using Direct3D’s <strong>High-Level Shader Language</strong> (HLSL), which is similar to C but used implementing vertex shaders without the need for assembly, although the latter is still possible.</p><p>Both Xenos and <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#tab-8-2-vertex-shader">RSX</a> implement the Vertex Shader Model 3.0 (<code>vs_3_0</code>) specification, which outlines a common set of capabilities and limitations. This includes providing <strong>512 or more slots</strong> for instructions, <strong>branching opcodes</strong> and support for <strong>texture fetching</strong>, among others. The difference, however, is that Playstation 3 programmers must use Nvidia’s CG compiler (once a collaborative work with Microsoft’s HLSL) while Xenos developers rely on Microsoft’s toolkit instead, and thus use Direct3D’s HLSL compiler.</p><p>Furthermore, let’s not forget that the hardware carrying out those operations relies on a new formula. The new unified design means vertices are processed through a shared but bigger pipeline, which works as follows:</p><ol><li>Based on the received commands, the <strong>Vertex grouper</strong> reads the memory addresses where vertices are located in main RAM and the <strong>Tessellator</strong> transforms non-triangular geometry (i.e. quadrangles and parametric curves) into triangles, so the rest of the GPU can process it. The latter can also split triangles into smaller primitives, so bigger detail can be achieved without consuming extra bandwidth. The grouper can read <strong>16 Bytes</strong> of data per clock and caches the <strong>last 14 vertices</strong> processed.</li><li>The <strong>Sequencer</strong> loads the vertex shader and pulls vertex data using <strong>8 KB of cache</strong>.</li><li>Now that all vertex data is ready to be processed, <strong>3 Shader Pipes</strong> (groups of 16 ALUs, each) execute the shader program. Each shader pipe receives batches of 64 Bytes. Vector-to-vector arithmetic takes four cycles while vector-to-scalar operations take only one.</li><li>The <strong>Shader Export</strong> buffers the results and sends them back to the start of the line where <strong>Primitive Assembler</strong> picks them up for rasterization. Alternatively, the shader export can forward the results to the <strong>Backend Central</strong>, where they are exported to main RAM.<ul><li>The latter capability means <strong>a shader can write raw data into main RAM</strong>, remember this when we reach the ‘Anti-piracy’ section…</li></ul></li></ol></div><div id="tab-6-3-rasterization"><h4 id="tab-6-3-rasterization">Rasterization</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/pipeline_raster.f4f5c7686d94025fc5abf7012d5f0768a891f84de56541c3ee44adc1b87e7936.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="834" height="347" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/pipeline_raster.f4f5c7686d94025fc5abf7012d5f0768a891f84de56541c3ee44adc1b87e7936.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the rasterizer stage.</figcaption></figure><p>Once the primitives have been transformed or subdivided as requested, the rasterizer begins the transformation to pixels.</p><p>Firstly, the <strong>Primitive Assembler</strong> receives vertex data from the Tessellator and/or Shader Export and begins building triangles out of vertices. This operation takes one cycle, except when vertices require clipping and culling applied (to discard unseen triangles outside the bounding area).</p><p>Secondly, the <strong>Scan converter</strong> receives triangles and packs them into 8x8 pixel blocks called <strong>tiles</strong> (yes, the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#tab-5-1-tiles">same word</a> appropriated by 2D consoles…). The converter generates one tile per cycle and sends them to a dedicated unit that performs <strong>early Z and Stencil test</strong>. So far so good? Well, here’s the interesting part: the latter unit implements a new and efficient rejection technique called <strong>Hierarchical Z</strong> (Hi-Z).</p><p>Instead of testing each pixel of the triangle, Hi-Z evaluates groups of pixels (<strong>2x2 pixels</strong> in this case) by calculating the maximum and minimum Z-value among the four pixels. Then, if the maximum z-value of the quadrant is less than the respective value stored in memory, the whole portion is assumed to be occluded and the quadrant is discarded <sup id="bibref:32"><a href="#bib:graphics-baumann" role="doc-biblioref">[32]</a></sup>.</p><p>The Hi-Z block uses dedicated memory for these operations, this memory can store up to 16 different Z-values for Z-testing <strong>64 pixels per cycle</strong>. The downside is that available memory only allows Xenos to perform Hi-Z if the framebuffer’s resolution is no greater than 1280 x 720 pixels along with MultiSampling Anti-aliasing with up to two samples (2x MSSA) activated.</p><p>Finally, the scan converter gets back groups of 2x2 blocks (so 16x16 pixels in total) and sends them in batches of 64 pixels to the next stage, where the pixel shader adds the <em>eye-catching</em> effects.</p></div><div id="tab-6-4-pixel-shader"><h4 id="tab-6-4-pixel-shader">Pixel Shader</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/pipeline_pixel.bd788d151387f45ffc293de587d669fb712248f8d2a1682368bdbc7c1e956360.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="786" height="482" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/pipeline_pixel.bd788d151387f45ffc293de587d669fb712248f8d2a1682368bdbc7c1e956360.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the pixel shader stage.</figcaption></figure><p>To execute the pixel shader, Xenos re-uses the same components of the vertex pipeline with slight detours. Similarly, HLSL’s Pixel Shader Model 3.0 (<code>ps_3_0</code>) specification states what developers can accomplish at this stage, which is not significantly different from <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#tab-8-4-pixel-shader">Sony’s counterpart</a>. Nevertheless, since the underlying foundation has been simplified (well, unified), resources have been homogenised, improving the balance of performance across all stages.</p><p>That being said, the pixel stage works as follows:</p><ol><li>The <strong>Sequencer</strong> loads the pixel shader program and forwards pixels to the interpolator.</li><li>The <strong>Shader Pipe interpolator</strong> interpolates colours between four vertices (creates intermediate values to fill in the gap between two extremes) that will be used by the pixel shader. It can generate 16 colours per cycle.</li><li><strong>32 KB of Texture cache</strong> fetches and decompresses textures from main RAM, then, the <strong>Texture pipes</strong> send up to 16 texels per cycle to the shader pipes. The texture pipes can instantly apply bilinear filtering, but they also offer trilinear and anisotropic filtering at the cost of extra cycles.</li><li>The <strong>3 previous Shader pipes</strong> are now used to execute the pixel shader, each pipe operates vertex made of 16 2x2 pixel blocks coming from the interpolator. The ALUs can process 32-bit floating-point numbers (IEEE 754 compliant) without penalties.</li><li>The <strong>Shader Export</strong> and <strong>Backend Central</strong> forward the results to memory. The latter outputs two blocks of 2x2 pixels (8 pixels in total) per cycle. Other kinds of data that can be exported include new Z-values for the Z-buffer and arbitrary data to main RAM.<ul><li>The result from the shader export doesn’t necessarily have to be the final frame buffer, games with lots of scenery often render multiple buffers (called ‘render targets’) that are used to derive the final frame. This is called <strong>Multiple-pass rendering</strong> and Xenos supports outputting <strong>up to four multiple render targets</strong> (MRT) at the same time <sup id="bibref:33"><a href="#bib:graphics-baumann" role="doc-biblioref">[33]</a></sup>.</li></ul></li></ol></div><div id="tab-6-5-pixel-operations"><h4 id="tab-6-5-pixel-operations">Pixel Operations</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/pipeline_post.8304b1eabce0988c69591d3a932fb3b187ba0b06c8036dc9a89173835dd52e74.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="732" height="572" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/gpu/pipeline_post.8304b1eabce0988c69591d3a932fb3b187ba0b06c8036dc9a89173835dd52e74.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of pixel operations available.</figcaption></figure><p>This is as far as it goes for rendering, but one thing we haven’t explored yet is how those 10 MB of EDRAM benefit all of this. Well, this chip is very special, because it contains internal logic to perform automatic <strong>Multisample Antialiasing</strong> (MSAA) along with <strong>Depth and Stencil testing</strong>. Its internal bandwidth (between its internal logic and internal memory) provides an absurd <strong>256 GB/second</strong>, which makes it very attractive for storing intermediate buffers (as opposed to storing them in main RAM).</p><p>The only drawback is that 10 MB <strong>is not enough</strong> for storing large buffers, especially those needed for rendering high-definition frames (1280x720 pixels wide with 2x MSAA enabled), let alone 1920x1080 frames. But fear not, as ATI supports <strong>tiled rendering</strong> (the same featured in the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/dreamcast/#graphics">Dreamcast</a>!). This enables to render portions of the screen, store the results in EDRAM (for performance reasons) and, finally, reconstruct the tiles in main RAM to form the final frame. Tiled rendering became critical that Microsoft took a step forward and devised <strong>Predicated Tiling</strong> <sup id="bibref:34"><a href="#bib:graphics-tiling" role="doc-biblioref">[34]</a></sup>, a function in Direct3D that automatically sets up and optimises the rendering pipeline specifically for tiled rendering. This prevents developers from manually programming each pipeline stage to handle tiles.</p><p>Thanks to the new bandwidth achieved, game designers may push for a level of quality that otherwise would’ve been unfeasible with a traditional rendering system. This includes applying extended antialiasing methods (<strong>4x MSSA</strong>) or even <strong>High-dynamic-range (HDR) rendering</strong>. You see, HDR requires 64-bit pixels, where each channel is encoded as a 16-bit <code>float</code>. This has always been very expensive in terms of bandwidth, but in exchange, it provides the right precision to obtain realistic lighting and colour effects, something the Xbox 360 can now enjoy.</p></div></div></div><h3 id="the-impact-on-the-industry">The impact on the industry</h3><p>The state of the industry after 15 years has demonstrated that the Unified shader model was meant to become another building block within GPUs. Interestingly enough, when Direct3D 10 and OpenGL 3.3 debuted in 2006 and 2010, respectively, not only they standardised this model, but they also defined new features and applications that were now possible to implement. For instance, a new pipeline stage called <strong>Geometry shader</strong> was added in Direct3D 10 to expand the uses of the tessellator.</p><div><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/screenshots/windows/froggy.5e4d2771cff6ae5d31e74e94c097b27d22faf9106c19cd6061be62bbb4d61565.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/screenshots/windows/_hufe073aea90cb0a256cd3073b154e04c6_90553_acaedf73b4ae17468b1229a3c91def9e.webp 500w,

For demonstration purposes, the demo also allows to, ehem, slap and stretch the <em>poor ugly</em> frog.</figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, over the next years since the console’s release, the concepts of Xenos’ shader exports would be embraced by many new APIs, namely Apple &amp; Khronos’ <strong>OpenCL</strong>, Nvidia’s <strong>CUDA</strong>, Direct3D 10’s <strong>DirectCompute</strong> and OpenGL 4.3’s <strong>Compute shaders</strong>. All of which provide a platform to access the power of GPUs without necessarily having to render anything, just perform computation using the fast shader pipes. Overall, this was another great leap for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#importance-of-programmability">General-purpose GPU</a> programming.</p></div><p>Now, if you wonder if any of these advancements were later incorporated into the Xbox 360. I’m afraid by the time this console debuted, the unified shaders were still a relatively new concept. So, unfortunately, none of the consequent developments (i.e. Direct3D 10) got ever back-ported to the Xbox 360. But hey, that’s a legacy left for the next generation of consoles to enjoy!</p><p>On the other side, the PC market experienced a different revolution that strangely didn’t originate from ATI.

Games were still only required to support 16:9 and 4:3 ratios, so using 16:10 would show a black backdrop (a.k.a. letterbox). Curiously enough, the operating system contains routines to allow games to detect whenever 16:10 is activated, though they were never made public.</p><p>Additionally, Microsoft shipped a software update in May 2011 to add support for 3D TVs, much like the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#real-3d-visionprojection">Playstation 3 did</a>.</p><h4 id="new-attitudes-towards-resolutions">New attitudes towards resolutions</h4><p>Even though the video encoder can broadcast signals in a multitude of formats, including PAL, NTSC, 720p and 1080p, Microsoft pushed publishers to <strong>focus on 720p</strong> for two reasons:</p><ul><li>The general consensus from 2005 predicted that most consumer TVs will soon be equipped with high-resolution and widescreen screens.</li><li>Since it would take time to master Xenos’ capabilities, launch titles were assumed to not use all of the GPU resources. Thus, games painlessly added HD support to compensate.</li></ul><p>With the same rationale, why is not 1080p the focus instead? Well, 1080p would put a significantly higher workload on Xenos, which would limit effects like anti-aliasing. Instead, Microsoft suggested developers should render at 720p and direct the internal video scaler to upscale it to 1080p, if required. To assist with this, Microsoft released another software update in October 2006 to enable 1080p (initially, only 1080i had been available).</p><hr/><h2 id="audio">Audio</h2><p>As CPUs evolve to become multi-core jack of all trades, the grounds for housing dedicated audio hardware slowly dissipates. In the end, Microsoft decided that the Xbox 360’s audio department would be the responsibility of the CPU, and as such, the <strong>audio pipeline is implemented through software</strong>. So, the operating system provides routines which games access through the official SDK.

Initially, they were delivered through third-party software (i.e. Nero and Winamp, to state a few) and later bundled with the operating system (i.e. Windows XP and its integrated CD burner; and Mac OS X 10.1 bundled with iTunes).</p><p>Now, if we take a deeper dive into the music world and its never-ending sharing systems, we see that the MP3 became the de-facto codec used for transmitting music <sup id="bibref:40"><a href="#bib:audio-mp3" role="doc-biblioref">[40]</a></sup> and that brings huge demand for media players that decode MP3 (well, technically, MPEG-1). That being said, what is Microsoft’s response to this trend? Well, develop <em>another</em> codec to displace MP3, a new format called <strong>Windows Media Audio</strong> or ‘WMA’ <sup id="bibref:41"><a href="#bib:audio-wma" role="doc-biblioref">[41]</a></sup>.</p></div><div id="tab-7-2-a-new-push-for-wma"><h4 id="tab-7-2-a-new-push-for-wma">A new push for WMA</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/screenshots/windows/media11.46697d725600aec4099abc8f56a97bba93f1d94fe03a82ef37a4863d18e12026.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="358" height="429" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/screenshots/windows/media11.46697d725600aec4099abc8f56a97bba93f1d94fe03a82ef37a4863d18e12026.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Windows Media Player 11, released in 2006. Now with a fancier UI and more proprietary codecs!</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately for them, the adoption of WMA wasn’t as popular as MP3, presumably due to Microsoft’s licensing schemes. To top it off, Microsoft fragmented the WMA user base by releasing non-backwards compatible revisions and offering multiple tiers. Yet, the company still kept pushing for adoption by other means, for instance, through DirectX’s audio playback libraries, namely ‘DirectShow’ <sup id="bibref:42"><a href="#bib:audio-directshow" role="doc-biblioref">[42]</a></sup>.</p><p>You can see now that it’s not difficult to put two and two together. The original Xbox was conceived as a ‘DirectX-compatible console’ and, while one could debate about such statement, the same slogan also applied to the Xbox 360. So, it’s no mystery that WMA carried on in this console.</p><p>However, Microsoft didn’t bring WMA in its current form. Instead, they enhanced it to make it an attractive codec for game studios (already adopting Sony’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/#audio">ATRAC3</a>). In essence, Microsoft grabbed the high-end WMA tier (called ‘WMA Pro’) and added more levels of compression that were favourable to the bandwidth capacity of the Xbox 360. Finally, they renamed it <strong>Xbox Media Audio</strong> or ‘XMA’.</p><p>For the coup de grace, Microsoft added dedicated circuitry to offload CPU cycles during decompression tasks, so the CPU can focus on other parts of the game.</p></div></div></div><h3 id="a-look-at-the-xma-accelerator">A look at the XMA accelerator</h3><p>In terms of functions, The XMA decoder can either decode up to <strong>5.1 audio channels</strong> with a sample rate of <strong>48 kHz</strong> and a resolution of <strong>16-bit</strong>.

The Southbridge connects to most, if not all, internal and external interfaces.

The SMC abstracts lots of I/O operations, including power management, real-time clock, temperature control, LED control and the infrared sensor <sup id="bibref:44"><a href="#bib:io-smc" role="doc-biblioref">[44]</a></sup>.

The ‘Slim’ re-design of the Xbox 360 released in the same year was also branded ‘Kinect compatible’ as it could supply power to the bar as well (with the provision of an extra proprietary port on the back of the console), older models require a separate power brick for the Kinect.</p><hr/><h2 id="operating-system-and-backwards-compatibility">Operating System (and backwards compatibility)</h2><p>The Xbox 360 was subject to the same needs and fashions that the Playstation 3 went through.

Just like the Playstation 3, Microsoft built their OS to provide multimedia and networking (i.e. multi-player) capabilities, plus the ability to play games and secure the system from external intrusion.</p><p>That being said, the system contains a few core components that take care of the low-level area of this console (hardware access, security and resource management). The rest is composed of applications (i.e. the splash animation, the interactive shell called ‘Dashboard’ and the game itself) and user data (i.e. game saves, user profile, network settings).</p><h4 id="a-tumultuous-progress">A tumultuous progress</h4><p>Throughout the life of this console, I noticed a more chaotic evolution than its competitor, which involved constant re-branding and radical redesigns of the user interface. I presume Microsoft was trying to shift from one target audience to another. So, to understand this section better, I’ve organised its evolution into these periods:</p><ul><li>The <strong>multimedia hub era</strong> (2005-2008): as the first home console to debut in the 7th generation, high-definition graphics, Xbox Live (online platform) and HD movies were the main selling points. And in the case you got bored with them, you could resort to buying accessories <sup id="bibref:53"><a href="#bib:operating_system-acc_promo" role="doc-biblioref">[53]</a></sup> (i.e. the remote controller, the headset, the HD DVD reader) to ‘enhance’ your experience.</li><li>The <strong>competitive era</strong> (2008-2011): with the Playstation 3 and the Wii now occupying store space, Microsoft found itself in need to aggressively compete for the consumer’s attention. First, a new system update called ‘New Xbox Experience’ overhauled the old interface to increase user personalisation (i.e. 3D avatars) and enhance the social aspect of this console. Meanwhile, a new ‘killer app’ lands in the form of a physical accessory: Kinect. Nobody knows its outcome, yet it proves a very engaging topic of conversation.</li><li>The <strong>cloud era</strong> (2011-2013): as all the previous enthusiasm slowly dissipates, Microsoft simplified its user interface to align with its other platforms (Windows 8 and Windows Phone 7) and provided users with the chance to move their local data to the cloud (a.k.a Microsoft’s servers). In the process, third-party advertising became more prominent in the user interface (possibly to increase their source of income). Nonetheless, users are now expecting the successor of the Xbox 360.</li><li>The <strong>capitulation</strong> (2014 onwards): with the new successor (Xbox One) reaching the stores, Microsoft dedicated minimum efforts to their (now old) console. Users will only receive system updates in the form of bug fixes.</li></ul><h4 id="a-recallable-security-design">A recallable security design</h4><p>If you recall <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#operating-system">my deconstruction</a> of the Playstation 3’s operating system, the latter was divided into three areas:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Hypervisor</strong>, which has complete control of the hardware.</li><li>The <strong>Kernel</strong>, interfacing user programs (mostly games) with the hypervisor, and in doing so it provides an extra layer of protection.</li><li>The <strong>user space</strong>, encompassing all programs executing on top of the kernel, including games and other apps (i.e. the shell and media player).</li></ul><p>This design is correlated to the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#cells-privileged-security">PPU’s privilege levels</a> (affecting both Cell and Xenon) which prevents ‘casual’ applications, like games, from accessing sensitive resources, such as decryption keys.</p><p>IBM enacted three privileges (instead of just two) to allow multiple operating systems running at the same time. With this idea, each OS would only live under the two lowest levels while the highest level would be reserved for the program supervising all operating systems. In practice, the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 only require a single operating system (except for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#a-multi-os-proposal">OtherOS</a>, but that was quickly scrapped). Consequently, Sony and Microsoft designed a hypervisor that enforces their respective security model and performs memory management tasks. Conversely, the architectural differences between Cell and Xenon led to very distinct implementations of hypervisors, so each is subject to unique flaws and strengths.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/os_levels.9bae20aff395c6d9ca8691919b9040f86a4b475c80ce6dfc51429881e8587133.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="722" height="408" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/os_levels.9bae20aff395c6d9ca8691919b9040f86a4b475c80ce6dfc51429881e8587133.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Diagram showing how the components of the Xbox operating system fit in Xenon’s privilege levels.</figcaption></figure><p>The most notable difference between the security model of the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3, is that the former runs both the Kernel and user-space programs <strong>under the same privilege mode</strong> (the second level) <sup id="bibref:54"><a href="#bib:cpu-steil" role="doc-biblioref">[54]</a></sup>. So, all critical tasks rest within Hypervisor, which enjoys extra acceleration from the hardware side (I’ll explain more about it in the ‘Anti-piracy’ section).</p><h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3><p>Let’s take a deep dive at the operating system’s main components, note this doesn’t include the boot loaders, but for that, I’ve dedicated a separate section. For now, we’ll check the components that reside in memory after the console boots up.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-9-1-the-hypervisor-link"><a href="#tab-9-1-the-hypervisor">The Hypervisor</a></li><li id="tab-9-2-the-kernel-link"><a href="#tab-9-2-the-kernel">The Kernel</a></li><li id="tab-9-3-the-user-land-link"><a href="#tab-9-3-the-user-land">The User land</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-9-1-the-hypervisor"><h4 id="tab-9-1-the-hypervisor">The Hypervisor</h4><p>The Hypervisor is an incredibly small program that only occupies <strong>128 KB</strong> <sup id="bibref:55"><a href="#bib:operating_system-renard" role="doc-biblioref">[55]</a></sup>. Furthermore, by being assigned the highest privilege level available, it’s tasked with:</p><ul><li>Preventing programs from accessing areas beyond the permitted boundaries.</li><li>Combined with the use of page tables, it restricts which areas of memory can be executed by the CPU. This technique is called <strong>Write Xor Execute</strong> or ‘W^X’.</li><li>Encrypting executable code.</li><li>Refusing to load executables that aren’t signed by Microsoft.</li><li>Protecting memory data from being tampered with. This is done by encrypting the data in main RAM and decrypting it just after the CPU fetches it from L2 cache.<ul><li>This is a complex but interesting feature which is explained further in the ‘Anti-piracy’ section.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The hypervisor is operated through the use of ‘system calls’ <sup id="bibref:56"><a href="#bib:operating_system-hypervisor" role="doc-biblioref">[56]</a></sup>, external programs invoke these to request functions from the hypervisor. Though whether the hypervisor complies or not is a matter of the program’s accreditations.</p></div><div id="tab-9-2-the-kernel"><h4 id="tab-9-2-the-kernel">The Kernel</h4><p>Since the Hypervisor focuses on bare-metal services, an extra layer of abstraction is added in the form of a <strong>Kernel</strong>. The latter also resides in memory but gets assigned a lower privilege level. The main job of the Kernel is to expose routines that user-land programs can benefit from, for instance:</p><ul><li><strong>Device drivers</strong>: in essence, I/O is interfaced by the Kernel so programs are not hardcoded to specific hardware (resulting in platform-dependent code), which would prevent old games from working on late Xbox 360 revisions.</li><li><strong>File system management</strong>: a file system defines how data is organised in a physical medium, the Xbox 360 supports many types of mediums and the Kernel implements various file systems for each one. This enables programs to manipulate persistent storage using files and directories and not raw sectors.</li><li><strong>Bootstrapping</strong> core applications: once the Kernel is up and running, it makes sure that the user interface and other executables are running, allowing the user to interact with the console.</li><li><strong>Thread scheduling</strong>: remember the previous paragraph about programming styles? Well, the thread scheduler is found here. Furthermore, the scheduler implements <strong>preemptive multitasking</strong> as its method for alternating between threads and avoiding jams.<ul><li>To balance performance across all running services, the scheduler applies some constraints. For instance, the fourth hardware thread is reserved for the audio pipeline and software downloads; and the second hardware thread is prioritised for concurrent file system operations.</li></ul></li></ul><p>To work, the kernel <strong>reserves 32 MB from main RAM</strong> to allocate all its resources.</p></div><div id="tab-9-3-the-user-land"><h4 id="tab-9-3-the-user-land">The User land</h4><p>User-land programs encompass any executable running on top of the kernel. These are found in the form of a special container called <strong>Xbox EXecutable</strong> or ‘XEX’ <sup id="bibref:57"><a href="#bib:operating_system-fs" role="doc-biblioref">[57]</a></sup>; and follow a similar structure to the traditional EXE container used by Windows - albeit tailored to the specifications of the Xbox 360. The most important difference is that XEX’s executable code follows the PowerPC ISA binary structure (instead of x86) and it must be encrypted to run (the code is signed with Microsoft’s private keys and the headers/meta-data store a hash to prevent tampering).</p><p>From the boot animation to the game itself, everything is a distinct XEX file. Some are automatically loaded by the Kernel (the boot animation and the interactive shell) and others by the user (the game, the media player, etc) using the shell. When the user or the Kernel request to run a XEX, the Kernel copies it to main memory and the Hypervisor checks its signature, re-encrypts it, marks the area as ‘executable’ and finally instructs the CPU to run it <sup id="bibref:58"><a href="#bib:cpu-steil" role="doc-biblioref">[58]</a></sup>.</p><p>While this console doesn’t provide any fancy multitasking between games (which is not a priority for a console, in my opinion), the Kernel still takes the aforementioned 32 MB of main RAM as its working area. This is what makes it possible to open the <strong>Xbox Guide</strong> (that popup menu that shows up after pressing the ‘Xbox logo’ button on the controller) and/or play music mid-game. To switch between full-screen applications, the Xbox Guide contains an entry to return to the dashboard (loading it up again) so the user can select another program.</p><p>Finally, all user data is grouped into a virtual <strong>Profile</strong>. Thus, the Kernel runs another program called ‘XAM’ which provides profile-related services (achievements tracking, avatar selector, save data storage) <sup id="bibref:59"><a href="#bib:operating_system-ss" role="doc-biblioref">[59]</a></sup>. A new profile is set up upon powering the console for the first time and there can be more than one profile stored.</p></div></div></div><h3 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h3><p>As a compelling side note, the Xbox 360 can run a considerable subset of games belonging to the previous Xbox (to avoid confusion, let’s call it the ‘classic’ one). This was done through pure and hard <strong>software emulation</strong> and, while it didn’t provide the same degree of compatibility of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#backwards-compatibility">CECHA PS3 revision</a>, I believe the methods were more clever, cost-effective and consistent.</p><p>The emulator was called ‘FU’ <sup id="bibref:60"><a href="#bib:operating_system-brundage" role="doc-biblioref">[60]</a></sup> (found as <code>xefu.xex</code>) and it could only be installed in the Hard Drive, residing next to other optional assets for the operating system. FU loaded every time the user booted up a classic Xbox game into the Xbox 360. However, for an ‘enjoyable experience’, FU would only proceed with the emulation if the game was listed in its local <strong>whitelist</strong>, where Microsoft tracked which games were deemed ‘playable’. As more system updates were released, more games were added to the whitelist.</p><p>Michael Brundage, one of the authors of FU, described the development process as ‘probably the hardest technical challenge of my career’ and also mentions ‘how inefficient most standard libraries are, especially at math.’ <sup id="bibref:61"><a href="#bib:operating_system-brundage" role="doc-biblioref">[61]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="storage-medium">Storage medium</h3><p>Now that we’ve seen the structure of the OS, let’s now check how information is scattered across this console. You’ll soon find that there’s an abundance of mediums available, and Microsoft had to device different file systems and protocols to keep the security integrity in place.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-10-1-boot-rom-link"><a href="#tab-10-1-boot-rom">Boot ROM</a></li><li id="tab-10-2-internal-nand-link"><a href="#tab-10-2-internal-nand">Internal NAND</a></li><li id="tab-10-3-memory-units-and-hdds-link"><a href="#tab-10-3-memory-units-and-hdds">Memory Units and HDDs</a></li><li id="tab-10-4-external-usb-link"><a href="#tab-10-4-external-usb">External USB</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-10-1-boot-rom"><h4 id="tab-10-1-boot-rom">Boot ROM</h4><p>Here lies the most critical and fragile program of this console.

On the top of it, you’ll find a modified SATA socket for a <strong>hard drive</strong> (only fits those encased and sold by Microsoft). Both of these mediums are <strong>optional</strong> and used as <strong>mass storage devices</strong>.</p><p>Upon fitting any of them, the Xbox 360 initialises it and adds a multitude of partitions. Though it doesn’t write a master partition table! It turns out the locations (offsets) of each partition are already hardcoded into the Kernel and all partitions - except the one storing user data - are fixed in size. Additionally, every partition uses proprietary and undocumented filesystems (recall that this is coming from the company that co-authored FAT, NTFS and exFAT), including one called ‘FAT Xbox’ (<strong>FATX</strong>) for generic data and ‘Secure Transacted File System’ (<strong>STFS</strong>) for caching purposes <sup id="bibref:65"><a href="#bib:operating_system-fatx" role="doc-biblioref">[65]</a></sup>.</p><p>As long as there’s space, either medium can store user profiles, game saves, downloaded games (initially called ‘arcades’) and downloadable content (DLCs).

That’s what the boot loader is for, and there are many, <em>many</em> stages in this system.</p><h4 id="multicore-chaos">Multicore chaos</h4><p>Before we begin, we need to address something fundamental. With homogenous multi-core CPUs, all cores are entitled to ‘own’ the system, but this would only lead to chaos, so only one is tasked with directing the rest. The leader is commonly called ‘master core’ while the rest is named ‘slave core’ or just ‘core’.</p><p>Outside the Xbox world, this hierarchy is sometimes found hardwired into the chip, while other architectures need manual intervention. For instance:</p><ul><li>On ARMv7, all cores wake up at the same time and look for the same reset vector (<code>0x00000000</code>). Thus, the program, now running multiple times, must make each CPU query its <code>mpidr</code> register to identify what type of CPU (master or slave) it’s running from. After this, it can take appropriate action (i.e. give orders or wait for commands) <sup id="bibref:73"><a href="#bib:operating_system-mpidr" role="doc-biblioref">[73]</a></sup>.</li><li>With x86, the first core is the master one. Thus, the first core starts at <code>0xFFF00000</code> while the other cores are ‘asleep’. The master then sends an interrupt to the neighbouring cores with an arbitrary address directing them where to start execution.</li></ul><p>In the case of PowerPC, well… it’s a tricky situation because Xenon was a custom order and not part of IBM’s PowerPC 2.02 spec. But by looking at some low-level homebrew source code for this console <sup id="bibref:74"><a href="#bib:operating_system-mainc" role="doc-biblioref">[74]</a></sup>, I presume the boot handling is similar to x86.</p><h4 id="boot-procedure">Boot procedure</h4><p>With all being said, now I’ll describe what the Xbox 360 does after the user presses the power button.</p><p>First things first, the reset vector of the master core appears to be <code>0x80000200.00000000</code> <sup id="bibref:75"><a href="#bib:operating_system-resetpc" role="doc-biblioref">[75]</a></sup>, this points to a <em>secret location</em> within the CPU: the aforementioned 32 KB of BootROM, where the first stage of the boot process is located.</p><p>For the sake of completion, there will be a tiny mention of a special device called ‘eFuse’. This is another storage medium similar to ROM or RAM, but with distinct physical qualities. I’ll talk more about it in the ‘Anti-piracy’ section to avoid overwhelming you, so for now, just remember those basic facts.</p><p>Without further ado, here is the how the boot chain works, the starting point being the boot ROM <sup id="bibref:76"><a href="#bib:operating_system-boot_process" role="doc-biblioref">[76]</a></sup> <sup id="bibref:77"><a href="#bib:operating_system-kernel_boot" role="doc-biblioref">[77]</a></sup>:</p><ol><li><strong>1BL</strong> (as of ‘1st Boot Loader’): The master core fetches the next stage (called ‘CB’) from NAND into the internal SRAM. CB is found encrypted with the RC4 algorithm. So, the CPU derives a decryption key using a key stored in 1BL and another stored in the header of CB. Once decrypted, the CPU checks its validity by hashing decrypted area and comparing the resulting hash with another stored in CB. The latter also uses Microsoft’s public RSA key, stored in the internal ROM, for validating the hash. Finally, if the whole process completes without the problems, the CPU continues execution at CB, otherwise, the CPU triggers a POST error and the Xbox 360 starts flashing red lights.<ul><li>This process involves a combination of many cyphers, such as HMAC, SHA-1 and ROT.</li></ul></li><li><strong>2BL</strong> or <strong>CB</strong>: The CPU, now executing from the internal SRAM, queries the eFuses to check that the version of CB running matches the one written on the eFuses. Then, it initialises most of the hardware. Finally, the CPU proceeds to fetch another block from NAND called ‘CD’ onto main RAM and repeats similar decryption and verification tasks 1BL did, this time using another key derived from the ‘CPU key’ (stored in the eFuses). If everything goes well, the next stage proceeds.<ul><li>In later software updates, this process was split into two bootloaders (named CB_A and CB_B) to mitigate faults that were exploited to execute homebrew (more details in the ‘Anti-piracy’ section).</li></ul></li><li><strong>4BL</strong> or <strong>CD</strong>: This is another decryption stage, albeit closer to the actual payload. This time, the CPU fetches yet-another block called <strong>CE</strong>, which goes through familiar verification processes (involving RSA checks) and it’s subsequently decompressed in main RAM. Once unpacked, the CPU finds itself in front of the <strong>Kernel</strong> and the <strong>Hypervisor</strong>. But it’s not over yet, I’m afraid, as the CPU must now fetch system updates to apply to these two programs, a process known as <strong>CF</strong>. Before continuing, however, CD orders to compare the number of updates installed against a designated counter in the eFuses block. This is done to prevent <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/#tab-8-2-downgrading">downgrades</a>.<ul><li>The decompression algorithm used is called ‘LZX Delta’ and it’s authored by Microsoft.</li></ul></li><li><strong>CF</strong>: This stage takes care of fetching update blocks stored on NAND, these are decrypted and decompressed with LZX as well. Once they are ready, they are applied to the kernel and the hypervisor residing on main RAM. Once all updates are done, CF returns to CD.</li><li><strong>CD (upon return)</strong>: Now that everything is set, the CPU is redirected to the <strong>Hypervisor</strong> in main RAM.</li><li><strong>Hypervisor</strong>: This program takes over the hardware and then redirects execution to the <strong>Kernel</strong>, which in turn loads up the Splash animation and the <strong>Dashboard</strong>.</li><li>The user is now in control.</li></ol><h3 id="updatability">Updatability</h3><p>I guess it’s no news for you, but yeah, this console has an <strong>updatable operating system</strong>.</p><p>Though, it may surprise you that no matter the revision, all consoles ship with the same initial kernel (version <code>2.0.1888</code>) from 2005 <sup id="bibref:78"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-smc_hack" role="doc-biblioref">[78]</a></sup>.

A typical update will typically install the aforementioned patches for the hypervisor and kernel, but it will override user-land files like the dashboard. Finally, to prevent rolling back, the updater will finish by blowing an eFuse so, from now on, the Xbox will only be able to boot the updated version of the system.</p><p>Updates don’t usually require extra storage. However, when Microsoft released the ‘NXE’ update in 2008, the updater also installed static resources onto the Hard Drive (mainly themes and assets for the new 3D avatars) as NAND wasn’t big enough. This led Microsoft to increase the size of NAND in further revisions of the motherboard to bundle up to 512 MB of NAND, and later include internal memory units of up to 4 GB instead. You would only find these enhancements on hard-drive-less models.</p><h3 id="interactive-shell">Interactive shell</h3><p>I think it’s time to take a break from so much theory and go over the different graphical interfaces that this console underwent.

Here, each group of services (game, multimedia, settings, etc) is organised into different overlapping layers called ‘blades’. All share the same hierarchy level and focus, meaning the user can only open one blade/category at a time. To navigate around, the user must swap between blades and interact with the actionable controls placed.</p><p>In my opinion, this style reminds me of one of those brochures with eye-catching foldable designs (in fact, the manual that came with the console replicated this). Furthermore, the design language (typography, colour palette and blur effects) is somewhat relatable to <strong>Windows XP</strong> and its <strong>Media Center</strong> pack, even the first iterations of <strong>Windows Longhorn</strong> exhibit common traits.</p><p>Truth to be told, the overall design was strongly compromised to comply with both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios, without being able to take advantage of the latter. The organisation of elements wasn’t very consistent either, as some views, like the Xbox Guide, felt like all controls had to be squashed into a small space. The most limiting aspect, in my opinion, is the fact the indicators for navigation (list of available blades) were always shown on both edges of the screen. This consumed useful space for the opened blade. Thus, exceptional navigation segues had to be used to move away from the home screen hierarchy and reclaim full-screen space, at the cost of adding more inconsistency to the user interface.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is the GUI that gave this console an identity, and it’s obvious that it targeted the ‘young’ audience group, which worked <em>fine</em> for a few years.</p><h4 id="the-new-xbox-experience-2008">The ‘New Xbox Experience’ (2008)</h4><figure><ul><li id="tab-13-1-home-link"><a href="#tab-13-1-home">Home</a></li><li id="tab-13-2-apps-link"><a href="#tab-13-2-apps">Apps</a></li><li id="tab-13-3-settings-link"><a href="#tab-13-3-settings">Settings</a></li><li id="tab-13-4-storage-link"><a href="#tab-13-4-storage">Storage</a></li><li id="tab-13-5-avatar-link"><a href="#tab-13-5-avatar">Avatar</a></li><li id="tab-13-6-guide-link"><a href="#tab-13-6-guide">Guide</a></li></ul><figure id="tab-13-1-home"><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/screenshots/nxe/home.e3de39642f9bdc033f4e84dc7e244d19ed8ceadd7365d0e2d84590daa06538ba.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/screenshots/nxe/_hu1b38b379729053af59bf1eaa8c524db4_67757_43eee1b550e5b291221118c28ac7628e.webp 500w,

In 2008, Microsoft released a revamped Dashboard interface called <strong>New Xbox Experience</strong> (NXE) which focused on ‘infinite scrolling’ patterns to offer a wider selection of services on the front page. It also incorporated other elements like a glossy filter and 3D transitions recently popularised by <strong>Windows Vista</strong> and the new range of <strong>Windows Live</strong> applications.</p><p>With the new design, screens could now enjoy full-screen space without being conditioned by the hierarchical level they were placed in. Curiously enough, the navigation layout is very similar to what Sony designed with <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/#visual-shell">XMB</a>, where vertical arrows change category and horizontal arrows navigate through the elements of the same category.</p><h4 id="the-kinect-update-2010">The ‘Kinect’ update (2010)</h4><figure><ul><li id="tab-14-1-home-link"><a href="#tab-14-1-home">Home</a></li><li id="tab-14-2-apps-link"><a href="#tab-14-2-apps">Apps</a></li><li id="tab-14-3-settings-link"><a href="#tab-14-3-settings">Settings</a></li><li id="tab-14-4-storage-link"><a href="#tab-14-4-storage">Storage</a></li><li id="tab-14-5-avatar-link"><a href="#tab-14-5-avatar">Avatar</a></li><li id="tab-14-6-guide-link"><a href="#tab-14-6-guide">Guide</a></li></ul><figure id="tab-14-1-home"><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/screenshots/kinect/home.2dafaee30f85524d6a617ab29855e7fc0b6c78f0054447c2347c3fb9408fd479.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/screenshots/kinect/_hua79decf7d50c4c29499989007896b2da_106728_0f72072b3289686ee5f64ad9752338eb.webp 500w,

Due to its versatile design, Microsoft envisioned porting Metro to all of its platforms, which became a reality the following year with the arrival of <strong>Windows 8</strong> and a <strong>new update</strong> for the Xbox 360. Though the degree of adoption varied drastically between device, the Xbox 360 enjoyed a mostly unified implementation of Metro (unlike Windows 8, where the majority of applications still relied on the ‘classic’ design).</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/screenshots/windows/phone7_promotional.896ea59085f7c06a4aaad3878d55151edf25a6df4d5946e5ac1e3ba5bab8f9e3.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/screenshots/windows/_hu0cc85f4e2c9d7744f6d08a9b63a3d4d6_76421_f5235346b93b8dc60edd94bbe2a9f476.webp 500w,

Additionally, with the advent of small companies venturing into the video game business, a new category of <strong>‘Indy’ game developers</strong> emerged to define those game studios that share the same enthusiasms and/or talent but are obliged to work on a smaller budget.</p><p>As a consequence, Microsoft marketed two types of development kits <sup id="bibref:88"><a href="#bib:cpu-andrews" role="doc-biblioref">[88]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>Traditional game studios paying a full license would have access to the official <strong>Xbox Development Kit</strong> or ‘XDK’. This pack includes the entire SDK, many types of development hardware and, depending on their relationship with Microsoft, even prototypes.</li><li>Indy studios were offered an alternative suite called <strong>Microsoft XNA</strong>, which includes similar development hardware but a different SDK called ‘XNA’.</li></ul><p>To provide more resources, Microsoft deployed the <strong>Game Developer Network</strong> (GDN) and the <strong>XNA Creators Club</strong>, two online portals where developers would have access to more documentation and tools.</p><h4 id="available-tools-and-kits">Available tools and kits</h4><p>Those using the expensive XDK will see it follows the footsteps of its <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#tab-8-2-microsoft-xdk">predecessor</a>. The APIs provided are largely based on DirectX’s routines to ease the learning curve for PC developers already familiar with DirectX on the Windows platform. XDK implements DirectX version 9.0c (identified as ‘9_3’) extended with Xbox-unique features.</p><p>All in all, the suite includes a variety of libraries and tools, for instance:</p><ul><li>Existing front-end <strong>Visual C and C+ 2005+</strong> compilers (Microsoft’s variant of C and C++), along with a new backend that generates PowerPC machine code. There are also PowerPC, xvs_3_0 and xps_3_0 assemblers (the latter two are Xenos’ microcode shader languages <sup id="bibref:89"><a href="#bib:graphics-ben" role="doc-biblioref">[89]</a></sup>). The front-end compilers were later updated to the 2010 version.</li><li>Microsoft’s <strong>Visual Studio 2005</strong> as IDE. Later versions of XDK shipped with the 2008 version and, finally, the 2010 one.</li><li><strong>Debuggers</strong> for the Xbox 360 Development Kit.</li><li>The well-known <strong>Direct3D</strong> API for graphics. Although it’s hardly a replica of the Windows version. For example, the shader compiler now generates microcode at compile-time, unlike Windows’ edition where it’s done at runtime (as Windows games must support a multitude of graphics cards). The APIs have also been extended to accommodate Procedural Synthesis, Predicated Tiling and many more cases. These have been documented by the Xenia emulator’s development team <sup id="bibref:90"><a href="#bib:graphics-nopixel" role="doc-biblioref">[90]</a></sup>.</li><li>Familiar functions from <strong>Windows 2000’s Win32 API</strong>, now targeting the Xbox 360’s Kernel, such as the <code>CreateThread()</code> routine for multi-threading operations.</li><li>Old but soon-to-be-replaced APIs like <strong>DirectSound</strong> which, as seen in further revisions of the XDK, was soon succeeded with <strong>XAudio2</strong>. The latter was developed to take advantage of the unique features of the Xbox 360 and to unify the syntax with Windows’s DirectX APIs.</li><li>Other non-DirectX APIs like the <strong>Natural User Interface</strong> to operate Kinect; and <strong>Xbox 360 Unified Storage</strong> to abstract the large number of storage mediums available.</li></ul><p>Now, for the budget studios using XNA. Well, the latter was designed to facilitate <strong>cross-platform</strong> development for Windows XP and the Xbox 360 <sup id="bibref:91"><a href="#bib:games-carter" role="doc-biblioref">[91]</a></sup>. XNA worked as a <strong>wrapper of DirectX</strong>, so low-level functions were abstracted by routines that work on both Windows and the Xbox 360. Though additional code is still needed to accommodate the small discrepancies between the two unequal platforms <sup id="bibref:92"><a href="#bib:games-considerations" role="doc-biblioref">[92]</a></sup>, the platform still benefited many developers that were looking to port their games to the Xbox 360 without a lot of effort or cost.

I presume it was another cost-effective strategy, as the DVD disc got cheaper to produce and its readers could be outsourced to the most inexpensive and convenient manufacturer. Throughout the console’s lifespan, Microsoft had relied on Hitachi, LG, Toshiba, Samsung, Philips, BenQ and LiteON - including teams of two - to produce their DVD drives.</p><p>As a reminder, dual-layer DVDs (also called <strong>DVD-9</strong>) have a theoretical capacity of <strong>8.5 GB</strong>. A big advantage compared to the new <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#tab-14-1-blu-ray-discs"><em>blue-lasered</em> discs</a> of the Playstation 3, is that the Xbox 360 enjoys greater read speeds thanks to its <strong>12x drive</strong>, another reason to expel the hard drive from the requirements.</p><p>On the other side, games were greatly constrained by the usable capacity, those 8.5 GB were further limited by a secure filesystem called <strong>Xbox Game Disc 2</strong> or ‘XGD2’.

As Microsoft imposed the DVD for games, the company was also pushing a new format that could compete with the Blu-Ray for space on the movie shelves. I’m talking about the <strong>HD-DVD</strong> which, conveniently enough, uses Microsoft-owned API for interactive features (menus and such).</p><p>Thus, Microsoft’s goal lead to a separate accessory called <strong>Xbox 360 HD DVD Player</strong>, an external reader placed next to the console and requires its own power supply (so expect all the annoyances that come with it). Anyway, the reader connected through USB and shipped with an ‘HD DVD installation disc’ that installed an additional media player on the console. Although its behaviour differs depending on the Dashboard version: on the Blades Dashboard, the HD-DVD player integrated itself with the UI <sup id="bibref:100"><a href="#bib:games-hddvd_install_old" role="doc-biblioref">[100]</a></sup>. On newer dashboards, it showed up as a separate app <sup id="bibref:101"><a href="#bib:games-hddvd_install_new" role="doc-biblioref">[101]</a></sup>.</p><p>Internally, HD DVD stores pits and lands at a higher density than conventional DVDs, allowing it to store up to <strong>15 GB</strong> of data if single-layered or <strong>30 GB</strong> if dual-layered. While both Blu-Ray and HD-DVD rely on <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#tab-14-1-blu-ray-discs">blue-light diodes</a>, the latter exhibits a sparser distribution of pits; and the focal point of its laser is larger than the Blu-ray’s <sup id="bibref:102"><a href="#bib:games-hwu" role="doc-biblioref">[102]</a></sup>. Consequently, HD-DVDs can’t reach the competitor’s 25 GB/50 GB milestone.</p><p>After only two years of sitting on shelves, both HD-DVDs and the player were phased out in 2008 <sup id="bibref:103"><a href="#bib:games-chen" role="doc-biblioref">[103]</a></sup>. If you ask me, this duality between HD-DVD and Blu-Ray was just a battle of royalties, manufacturing costs and disagreement between distributors.

I presume the low-price point of this console and continuous marketing efforts - including all the accessories that Microsoft shipped (webcams, headsets, etc) - meant that Microsoft’s main source of profit relied on paid subscriptions and marketplace purchases.

This console has an incredibly long and diverse history <sup id="bibref:105"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-scene_history" role="doc-biblioref">[105]</a></sup> involving interesting discoveries, unexpected methods of exploitation and aggressive forms of retaliation. Most importantly, this saga led to many third-party documents detailing the construction of the hardware and the peculiarities of the software. So, it’s fair to say that half of the content in this article wouldn’t have been possible without the countless hours that many hacking groups dedicated to researching and documenting their findings - a task not necessarily done to enable piracy.</p><h3 id="main-targets">Main targets</h3><p>The first thing is to introduce the two main targets. As soon as the Xbox 360 reached the stores, Microsoft found itself defending two big fronts:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Hypervisor</strong>, which holds control of the CPU and enforces signed executables, both of which had to be tackled if Homebrew or booting another OS (i.e. Linux) were to ever be possible.<ul><li>By extension, this also affects user data (i.e. profiles stored on the hard drive and/or Memory Unit) but they implement extra layers of security. These are not mentioned here so we can focus on the main targets.</li></ul></li><li>The <strong>DVD drive</strong>, which enforces the copy protection system and prevented burned discs from being executed as games. DVDs are inexpensive and most PCs of that era were equipped with a DVD RW drive, so cracking looks extremely rewarding. Although, it would only lead to piracy, but not Homebrew (as the code is still signed). That is, unless someone discovers an exploit that depends on the DVD drive but once ‘triggered’ enables to execute Homebrew… we’ll see!<ul><li>Curiously enough, the hypervisor and the rest of the operating system have no awareness of the state of the copy protection <sup id="bibref:106"><a href="#bib:cpu-steil" role="doc-biblioref">[106]</a></sup>, that’s delegated to the disc drive, which has the upper hand on accepting the inserted disc as a valid Xbox 360 game or not.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="the-hypervisor-front">The hypervisor front</h3><p>We’ll now learn how the hypervisor is protected and, in turn, how it protects the rest of the system.</p><h4 id="a-hidden-cryptographic-system">A hidden cryptographic system</h4><p>Remember how complex was the L2 subsystem within Xenon? Well, there’s one more thing to explain, and that is the inclusion of a <strong>hidden cryptographic block</strong> in it. I define it as ‘hidden’ since it’s not documented at all by Microsoft or IBM. I was made aware of it thanks to an incredibly insightful talk called ‘The Xbox 360 Security System and its Weaknesses’ by the Free60 group (lead by Michael Steil and Felix Domke, the former also did ‘The ultimate GameBoy talk’!) <sup id="bibref:107"><a href="#bib:cpu-steil" role="doc-biblioref">[107]</a></sup> and ‘Security offence and defence strategies’ by Mathieu Renard <sup id="bibref:108"><a href="#bib:operating_system-renard" role="doc-biblioref">[108]</a></sup>, which is where I rely on for a big part of the information described here.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/cpu/crypto.bd419c50ebf8c93211d473495b71dc770723c909433a2fa8eeaaf1fc8ed2f2fd.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="813" height="483" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/cpu/crypto.bd419c50ebf8c93211d473495b71dc770723c909433a2fa8eeaaf1fc8ed2f2fd.png" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the security components placed within Xenon.</figcaption></figure><p>Moving on, the cryptographic subsystem is split into distinct areas that perform unique functions:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-17-1-rand-unit-link"><a href="#tab-17-1-rand-unit">Rand unit</a></li><li id="tab-17-3-efuses-link"><a href="#tab-17-3-efuses">eFuses</a></li><li id="tab-17-4-cryptography-unit-link"><a href="#tab-17-4-cryptography-unit">Cryptography unit</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-17-1-rand-unit"><h5 id="tab-17-1-rand-unit">Rand unit</h5><p>The <strong>random number generator</strong> unit (or just ‘rand’) produces random sets of numbers without exposing a predictable pattern, or at least it attempts to. This is useful for supplying extra parameters to encryption routines, so they are difficult to trace back (and thus, reverse engineer it) or replicate.</p><p>You may now ask ‘Why can’t this be done with software?’ and, well, in the world of traditional computing, there’s no such thing as ‘pure randomness’. Computers can only generate pseudo-random numbers using arguments that may be potentially traced. So, having a dedicated unit for this task obfuscates its reverse engineering further and protects the CPU from possible snooping (as this block is hidden within the CPU and not scattered across the motherboard).</p><p>I guess the most optimal solution would be to connect the CPU to a quantum computer, but we are not there yet! (<em>somewhat close</em> though).</p></div><div id="tab-17-2-extra-storage"><p>Furthermore, this subsystem provides two extra memory blocks.</p><p>Firstly, <strong>32 KB of ROM</strong>, identical to the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#tab-12-1-cell-bootrom">Secure ROM</a> found in Cell. It’s used for storing unencrypted data that the CPU can read without fear of being exposed or traced by a third party. As you’ve seen before, this is where the first boot stage is found.</p><p>Secondly, <strong>64 KB of SRAM</strong> are provided as fast general-purpose memory that the CPU can use to work out a sensible operation (most probably cryptographically-related) without fear, again, of being <em>spied on</em>.</p></div><div id="tab-17-3-efuses"><h5 id="tab-17-3-efuses">eFuses</h5><p>Speaking of storage, we’ve got another special medium called ‘eFuses’ embedded within Xenon. eFuses are microscopic switches that the CPU reads as <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, such as any transistor. The peculiar thing about eFuses is that, once they are switched to <code>1</code>, their state is <strong>unchangeable</strong> (as writing a <code>1</code> <strong>blows</strong> the eFuse, like traditional fuses). This enables Microsoft to encode permanent counters or store encryption keys which can’t be changed once the console leaves the factory. Well, only <code>0</code> values may be changed, but their sequence is different on each console. Moreover, once the key is altered by a third party, the console can’t decrypt its data anymore!</p><p>In total, there are <strong>768 individual eFuses</strong> installed and each is treated as a ‘bit’ by the CPU, where <code>0</code> means ‘active’ and <code>1</code> means ‘blown’. The block is grouped into 12 ‘fusesets’, where each group contains 64 eFuses.</p><p>When eFuses are read or written to, they are done so in groups of <strong>8 eFuses</strong> (like 8-bit/hexadecimal values) and not individually. Albeit, sometimes, information is only encoded in the form of binary values (<code>0</code> and <code>1</code>) as opposed to hexadecimal format (from <code>0x0</code> to <code>0xF</code>). In those cases, the whole 8-bit word is blown at once and treated as a single binary value instead.</p></div><div id="tab-17-4-cryptography-unit"><h5 id="tab-17-4-cryptography-unit">Cryptography unit</h5><p>Next to the L2 cache, Microsoft and IBM added some <strong>hardwired logic</strong> to perform <strong>AES-128</strong> encryption and hashing functions without requiring the CPU at all. Using the previous 64 KB of SRAM, the L2 block automatically decrypts or encrypts data as it enters or leaves Xenon, respectively.</p><p>The L2 block can also hash memory pages on their way to main RAM, store the hash on SRAM and then compare it against the new hash when the page is fetched back from RAM. If the check fails, the system locks up <sup id="bibref:109"><a href="#bib:cpu-steil" role="doc-biblioref">[109]</a></sup>.</p><p>All of this is done to fend off any type of meaningful analysis on the memory buses (using encryption) and make sure RAM hasn’t been tampered with (through hashing).</p><p>To prevent replay attacks (which rely on duplicating old but valid blocks of data to fake authenticity), the Rand unit generates an unpredictable value every time the console boots up. Then, the L2 block mixes it with its encryption logic <sup id="bibref:110"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-gligli" role="doc-biblioref">[110]</a></sup>.</p></div></div></div><h4 id="security-implementations">Security implementations</h4><p>Let’s see what Microsoft came up with the use of all those components.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-18-1-chain-of-trust-link"><a href="#tab-18-1-chain-of-trust">Chain of Trust</a></li><li id="tab-18-2-irreversable-and-unique-numbers-link"><a href="#tab-18-2-irreversable-and-unique-numbers">Irreversable and unique numbers</a></li><li id="tab-18-3-secure-communication-link"><a href="#tab-18-3-secure-communication">Secure communication</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-18-1-chain-of-trust"><h5 id="tab-18-1-chain-of-trust">Chain of Trust</h5><p>The convoluted boot process you’ve read before was designed to implement a sophisticated <strong>chain of trust</strong>. This makes sure that, once the hypervisor is ready to execute userland code, the latter is always encrypted and signed by no other than Microsoft.</p><p>To efficiently obfuscate the boot process, multiple types of cyphers are employed. For instance, The second bootloader (2BL/CB) is decrypted using <strong>RC4</strong> (a fast algorithm), whose decryption key is constructed at run-time using <strong>HMAC-SHA</strong>. Then, the decrypted code is hashed (using <strong>SHA1</strong> and <strong>ROT</strong>). Finally, to check that 2BL hasn’t been tampered with, the calculated hash is compared against a stored hash pre-signed with Microsoft’s private key (using <strong>RSA</strong>).</p><p>For an increased protection, each console embeds a unique <strong>CPU key</strong> imprinted on the eFuses just before the console leaves the factory. At runtime, the CPU key is mixed with other parameters to devise part of the bootloader’s keys. All in all, this means cracking one CPU key won’t affect other consoles.</p><p>Once the Hypervisor is loaded into main RAM, the chain of trust is in place and no code will be executed without the Hypervisor’s permission, especially since the latter possesses <strong>W^X</strong> abilities.</p></div><div id="tab-18-2-irreversable-and-unique-numbers"><h5 id="tab-18-2-irreversable-and-unique-numbers">Irreversable and unique numbers</h5><p>To further protect the chain of trust and prevent external alterations, boot stages also query the cluster of <strong>768 eFuses</strong> to find the following information <sup id="bibref:111"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-fusesets" role="doc-biblioref">[111]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>The aforementioned <strong>CPU key</strong>, which is used to encrypt the other keys stored in the console.</li><li>A flag that states whether the console is a <strong>retail model or a development kit</strong>, which affects the availability of many debugging pins on the motherboard (i.e. JTAG).</li><li><strong>Two update counters</strong> (one for the updates applied on 2BL/CB and the other for the updates applied on the Hypervisor and Kernel). Every time Microsoft releases a ‘system update’ and the user installs it, the updater blows an eFuse. During boot, the CPU compares the eFuses value with the patches applied, if the values don’t match you get a famous ‘Red light of Dead’. This has prevented users from downgrading to exploitable revisions of the system.<ul><li>There are 5 fusesets reserved for the update counter. The counter is encoded in binary form, so eight fuses are blown after each update, which means the Xbox 360 can sustain up to <strong>80 updates</strong> throughout its lifetime. Ironically, Microsoft only started blowing eFuses after the <code>2.0.4548.0</code> update shipped.</li><li>Furthermore, there are <strong>16 eFuses</strong> available for updates on CB.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div id="tab-18-3-secure-communication"><h5 id="tab-18-3-secure-communication">Secure communication</h5><p>Xenon has a 64-bit address bus, yet, there’re only 512 MB of RAM (and a lump of I/O) to be addressed, meaning it can be <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#a-step-forward-or-a-step-backwards">wasteful</a> to make us of 64-bit addressing. As a result, one half of the address space is used for a more practical purpose: <strong>cryptography flags</strong>.</p><p>In essence, programs only use <strong>32-bit virtual addresses</strong>. Then, the MMU uses a page table to convert virtual addresses into 64-bit addresses, where the lower 32 bits encode the virtual address and the upper half store flags that denote whether the selected memory address is (or needs to be) encrypted and/or hashed.</p><p>The flags are automatically read by the L2 block, which then carries out the encryption/hashing operations accordingly.</p><p>Because there’s only <strong>64 KB of SRAM</strong> to store the page table and hashes, all main RAM can be encrypted but <strong>only the hypervisor is hashed</strong>.

In most cases, manufacturers just altered the firmware of their off-the-shelf hardware to abide by Microsoft’s requirements. In any case, the Hypervisor blindly trusts the drive on detecting which disc is genuine and which is not.</p><p>As the copy protection subsystem is subsequently delegated to a third-party, multiple concerns arise. For instance, drives still communicate using standard ATA commands <sup id="bibref:115"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-hacking_2" role="doc-biblioref">[115]</a></sup>, so they must find ways to obfuscate sensitive exchanges of data. Furthermore, drives must be prepared to overwrite their firmware in case Microsoft revise a new copy protection mechanism. All of this, while preventing unauthorised parties from accessing this functionality.</p><p>While going through each security measure of each manufacturer is beyond the scope of this article, it’s important to denote that during the cat-and-mouse games that ultimately emerged, Microsoft had little control over how they were protected and subsequently patched <sup id="bibref:116"><a href="#bib:cpu-steil" role="doc-biblioref">[116]</a></sup>, and this evident gap costed the company an early wave of piracy distribution.</p></div></div></div><h3 id="fallback-techniques">Fallback techniques</h3><p>As it’s obvious by now that anti-piracy measures can only protect for so much time. The Xbox 360 was designed to have a mostly-overridable operating system.

You will soon see the reasoning behind each one of these areas.</p><p>Additionally, Microsoft promoted (or actually, enforced) such updates by only permitting Xbox Live access from consoles running the latest system. This discouraged users from holding on to old versions and, combined with the anti-downgrade eFuses, reduced the availability of exploitable consoles, even for research purposes.</p><p>Finally, in the event of a modified console having access to Xbox Live services, Microsoft implemented many protections behind the scenes to keep hacked consoles and/or cheaters out of their network, including the use of ‘Phoning home’ routines to help Microsoft to detect ‘special’ consoles; and the subsequent application of ‘permanent bans’ by console blacklisting.</p><h3 id="defeat">Defeat</h3><p>If you’ve been following the Xbox 360’s scene for some years, you probably know by now that this console enjoyed one of the most creative exploits of its generation.

The new firmware instructed the drive to look for hardcoded security blocks instead, which pirated copies would have relocated.</p><p>The firmware was flashed through the use of ATA commands, but it required a computer with a spare SATA socket and special flashing software. Consequently, users had to open up the console and connect the SATA data cable to their computer, run the flasher while the console supplied energy to the drive and then re-assemble everything back. The act of flashing emerged from a hidden ‘maintenance mode’ that was discovered in the drive’s firmware, this was subsequently reversed and re-enabled. If the process was carried out successfully, the Xbox 360 would now read pirated games just like any genuine one.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/photos/flashing.3c3af262722a8681f725c521b50daeed160ea1b0c9b625588851f70a8a347bcf.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/photos/_hu3c35659da97177f94e17e5aecac66fb3_86447_18320debd90e4d2d93c18f75eda080d9.webp 500w,

As time went by, the techniques evolved but the fundamental idea remained the same (flash a custom firmware). Subsequent readers increased their security to seal backdoors and Microsoft helped by bundling DVD drive firmwares within their ‘software updates’ to undo any unauthorised work done by the user. In later years, readers levelled up to the point the user had to drill a hole into the drive’s System-on-Chip to enable flashing <sup id="bibref:122"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-hacking_2" role="doc-biblioref">[122]</a></sup>.</p><p>From Microsoft’s headquarters, a new disc format called <strong>XGD3</strong> was devised to improve the collection of challenges.

Simple, through <strong>direct access</strong> (<a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#taking-over-the-cpu">DMA</a>) and <strong>unencrypted data</strong>.

In other words, can we inject unsigned code into main RAM and then trick the hypervisor into executing it? Well, in February 2007, an anonymous hacker published a <strong>privilege escalation</strong> exploit that relied on the 2005 game <strong>King Kong</strong> <sup id="bibref:124"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-hv_vul" role="doc-biblioref">[124]</a></sup>. In the report, a clever chain of events was outlined to get arbitrary code execution at the hypervisor level (meaning full hardware access). The way it works is not simple to explain, but I’ll try my best. Let’s see…</p><div><ul><li id="tab-20-1-the-compare-flaw-link"><a href="#tab-20-1-the-compare-flaw">The compare flaw</a></li><li id="tab-20-2-a-new-syscall-link"><a href="#tab-20-2-a-new-syscall">A new syscall</a></li><li id="tab-20-3-king-kong-exploit-link"><a href="#tab-20-3-king-kong-exploit">King Kong exploit</a></li><li id="tab-20-4-priviledge-escalation-link"><a href="#tab-20-4-priviledge-escalation">Priviledge escalation</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-20-1-the-compare-flaw"><h5 id="tab-20-1-the-compare-flaw">The compare flaw</h5><p>To organise all the routines available, the hypervisor stores a <strong>syscall table</strong> in main RAM <sup id="bibref:125"><a href="#bib:cpu-steil" role="doc-biblioref">[125]</a></sup>, along with a handler that traverses such table.</p><p>When a program invokes a syscall, the handler starts by making sure the requested syscall number is valid. This is done by checking that its value is less than <code>0x61</code> (meaning there are up to 96 syscalls available). Finally, the handler translates the syscall number to a <strong>virtual address</strong> in memory (where the routine is found) and the CPU continues execution there.</p><p>Another concept to remember is that the hypervisor is stored in RAM in an <strong>encrypted</strong> form, and by extension all syscalls routines are encrypted too. Consequently, the resulting virtual address pointing to a routine has the encryption flag set. Thus, the L2 block seamlessly decrypts the data fetched from RAM before handing it to the CPU.</p><p>With that in mind, hackers took a look at the assembly code of the syscall handler and found a major flaw. Essentially, the syscall number is passed through a register. Registers in Xenon are 64-bit long, yet the validity check is implemented with the <code>cmplwi</code> instruction (used for unsigned 32-bit values). This means that if a program (previously authorised by the hypervisor) were to request a syscall with a value greater than <code>0xFFFFFFFF</code>, like <code>0x20000000.0000002A</code>, the hypervisor would only verify <code>0x0000002A</code> and that would pass the check.</p><p>Now, where am I going with this? Well, if you recall, the upper 32 bits on 64-bit virtual addresses are used as flags to instruct the L2 block to encrypt/decrypt or hash the memory values, and if the flags are all zeroes, the L2 will interpret the data as <strong>unencrypted</strong> and pass it right away. That being said, if <em>by some chance</em> an external piece of unencrypted code were to be inserted in RAM through external means, there might be a way to execute it through the flawed syscall handler…</p></div><div id="tab-20-2-a-new-syscall"><h5 id="tab-20-2-a-new-syscall">A new syscall</h5><p>The previous discovery seems promising, but there are still many loose ends. For instance, we still need a way to craft an arbitrary syscall that doesn’t get corrupted by the L2’s decryption block.</p><p>Well, to make a long story short, it was discovered that, while the syscall handler converts the syscall number into a virtual address, if the most significant bit of the resulting virtual address happens to be anything but <code>0</code>, then the converter <strong>won’t add the encryption flag</strong>. Thus, the L2 block won’t mangle the syscall function fetched, whether it’s encrypted or not.</p><p>This was the missing puzzle that would allow hackers to execute a crafted and unencrypted syscall number, leading to arbitrary code execution. But it’s not over yet, as we still need:</p><ul><li>An entry point that enables to inject the arbitrary syscall routine into main RAM.</li><li>Another entry point to request the crafted syscall number, so the arbitrary routine can be executed.</li></ul><p>And that’s what we’ll discuss now.</p></div><div id="tab-20-3-king-kong-exploit"><h5 id="tab-20-3-king-kong-exploit">King Kong exploit</h5><p>Enter the famous King Kong title. Like any other typical game, its discs stores vertex and pixel shaders files which are loaded at some point during gameplay. However, for some unknown reason, these files are found in completely plain (unencrypted) and unsecured form.</p><p>If you combine this with the fact the DVD drive can be modified to load duplicates, you could now make it load a King Kong game with modified shaders. Why would this be worth it? Well, do you remember the ‘memory export’ function I mentioned in the ‘Graphics’ section? Shaders can DMA to main RAM! <em>Oof</em>.</p><p>I guess you see where I’m going with this, if you craft a special copy of King Kong with custom shaders and insert it in an Xbox 360 with a flashed drive, you can start filling main RAM with arbitrary values. Hence, you can inject custom syscalls into main RAM.</p><p>This solves the first task of filling main RAM, but we still need a way of invoking the custom syscall…</p></div><div id="tab-20-4-priviledge-escalation"><h5 id="tab-20-4-priviledge-escalation">Priviledge escalation</h5><p>Recall that the Xbox 360’s kernel provides a scheduler to handle multi-threading. This apparatus takes care of dispatching virtual threads to the CPU cores and saving idle threads into memory for later use. Well, for another unexplained reason, the scheduler stores thread states in RAM as <strong>unencrypted</strong> data!</p><p>Combining all explained, one could now craft a shader that corrupts an idle thread in RAM which, once restored, would continue execution with custom parameters. This process would carry on until all parameters are finally in the hacker’s control <sup id="bibref:126"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-smc_hack" role="doc-biblioref">[126]</a></sup> so execution can be redirected to the syscall handler and, combined with the use of calculated parameters, would finally jump to the crafted (and unencrypted) syscall. This methodology is known as <strong>Return-Oriented Programming</strong> (ROP) and it was also used for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#homebrew-revival">late hacks</a> of the Playstation 3.</p><p>And this is pretty much how the hypervisor got hijacked by arbitrary code. A common payload bundled with this process consisted of a <strong>Linux launcher</strong>, as using Linux with full hardware privileges allowed users to extract sensitive information from their console, like the CPU key (which could come in handy in the future, you’ll soon see).</p></div></div></div><h3 id="protecting-king-kong">Protecting King Kong</h3><p>The King Kong exploit was a huge step for the Homebrew scene.

Nonetheless, efforts continued in finding similar exploits for updated consoles. Additionally, hackers could now obtain an outdated console and make use of the King Kong exploit to expand their research.</p><p>As a result, throughout the same year of the King Kong events (2007), new discoveries were made:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-21-1-a-hidden-maintenance-mode-link"><a href="#tab-21-1-a-hidden-maintenance-mode">A hidden maintenance mode</a></li><li id="tab-21-2-the-timing-attack-link"><a href="#tab-21-2-the-timing-attack">The timing attack</a></li><li id="tab-21-3-more-cb-research-link"><a href="#tab-21-3-more-cb-research">More CB research</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-21-1-a-hidden-maintenance-mode"><h4 id="tab-21-1-a-hidden-maintenance-mode">A hidden maintenance mode</h4><p>Once CB, the second stage bootloader, was reverse engineered, a new backdoor was discovered.

It so happens that during the eFuses validation (implemented with C’s <code>memcmp()</code>), the comparison is done on a byte basis. Most importantly, during each comparison, successful matches always take <strong>0.22 ms</strong> to complete and failed ones take <strong>0.21 ms</strong> <sup id="bibref:129"><a href="#bib:operating_system-renard" role="doc-biblioref">[129]</a></sup>.</p><p>Combining all this, one can automate a trial-and-error guesser until the whole signature is brute-forced.

Behind the scenes, they already knew about the implied exploit and were preparing to release a new technique that the public could take advantage of.</p></div><div id="tab-22-2-the-jtagsmc-hack"><h4 id="tab-22-2-the-jtagsmc-hack">The JTAG/SMC hack</h4><p>In November 2009, the Free60 group published their technical report which was later known as the <strong>SMC/JTAG hack</strong> <sup id="bibref:132"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-smc_hack_report" role="doc-biblioref">[132]</a></sup>. With this, the Xbox hacking community were made aware of two big discoveries.</p><p>The first one exposed the zero-pairing exploit that allowed to boot any system version, this is what I explained a couple of paragraphs before. The second one described how to <strong>automatically trigger the Hypervisor exploit and inject a payload</strong> in a console running a King-kong-vulnerable system version, meaning there would be no need to keep a modified copy of King Kong and a flashed drive anymore.</p><p>Because I’ve already explained the first exploit, let me go over the second one, as it’s quite uncanny. Remember the System Management Controller (SMC)? That wee Intel 8051 running inside the Southbridge to handle I/O tasks? Well, during boot, the SMC loads up its firmware from NAND, and that’s what Free60 exploited to take over the SMC.</p><p>As the motherboard exposes GPIO pins from the SMC and JTAG pins from the CPU and GPU, hackers found out that they could perform the following technique:</p><ol><li>Make an image of the NAND’s contents using a NAND reader.</li><li>Using the zero-pairing backdoor, modify the image to only apply updates leading to a King-Kong exploitable Hypervisor.</li><li>Modify the SMC firmware area (in the NAND’s image) so, during boot, the SMC commands the GPU to DMA the same block of code used in the King Kong disc.</li><li>Flash the modified NAND image back into the console using a hardware NAND writer.</li><li>Solder two wires with switching diodes between the SMC’s GPIO and the GPU’s JTAG.</li><li>Turn on the console and wait for the payload to show up.</li></ol><p>With this, a permanent and automatic homebrew launcher was obtained! (as long as you didn’t update to <code>2.0.8498</code>).</p></div></div></div><h3 id="the-dawn-of-homebrew">The dawn of Homebrew</h3><p>Even though the aforementioned discoveries were outraced by Microsoft’s updates, the homebrew community kept gaining momentum and new applications emerged to become a ‘must have’ for any modding enthusiast:</p><ul><li><strong>XeLL</strong> (from Xenon Linux Loader), later forked as <strong>XeLL-Reloaded</strong>, is the de-facto payload used with the Hypervisor exploit <sup id="bibref:133"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-xell" role="doc-biblioref">[133]</a></sup>. It sits as a second-stage bootloader with an amount of functionality analogous to a Victorinox for Scouts. XeLL enables to boot up Linux or a XEX executable written with <strong>libxenon</strong>, an alternative SDK designed for homebrew development. Furthermore, upon loading, its text interface automatically displays the eFuses data and other low-level information on-screen so the user can write it down if needed. If that’s not enough, its self-hosted HTTP site provides extra controls to dump the contents of the eFuses and NAND on-the-fly.</li><li><strong>freeBOOT</strong> is a modification of the official operating system that disables the signature verification of the Hypervisor and removes hardcoded caps set by Microsoft (i.e. the Security sector checks preventing to use of third-party hard drives), among other things <sup id="bibref:134"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-freeboot" role="doc-biblioref">[134]</a></sup>. freeBOOT is loaded from XeLL and proceeds to boot the official system as any other unmodified console, except that non-signed executables can be launched from the Dashboard from now on. At the time of this writing, applying Freeboot remains the main goal for most homebrew users.<ul><li>To produce a ‘freeBOOTed’ image (eventually flashed into the NAND), the CPU key of the console is needed. This means the console needs to first load XeLL (using a previous exploit) so the key can be extracted. Then, a new NAND image with Freeboot’s patches applied can be generated.</li></ul></li><li><strong>FreeStyle Dashboard</strong> and <strong>Aurora</strong> are two replacements for the original Dashboard that provide enhanced controls for executing homebrew apps, loading up game dumps and tweaking low-level settings (i.e. fan speed). While they are meant to overtake the official Dashboard, they are still loaded as any other XEX executable.</li><li><strong>XeX Loader</strong> and <strong>XeX Menu</strong> are homebrew launchers that can be run from the official Dashboard.</li><li><strong>Dashlaunch</strong> is another program that provides a collection of patches for the official system <sup id="bibref:135"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-dashlaunch" role="doc-biblioref">[135]</a></sup>, except they are loaded at runtime (avoiding the need for flashing NAND). One of Dashlaunch’s functions includes the ability to automatically load an executable after the Dashboard boots, this is often used to quickly load the alternative homebrew-friendly FreeStyle Dashboard or Aurora.</li></ul><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/screenshots/homebrew/fds.053b4b5264a76cc67c7a2977e63a71e5ea4590ca76632e8e818b970e57d4d656.jpg"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/screenshots/homebrew/fds.053b4b5264a76cc67c7a2977e63a71e5ea4590ca76632e8e818b970e57d4d656.jpg" loading="auto"/></picture></a><figcaption>FreeStyleDash running on my modified console, offering many controls and indicators not found on the official dashboard.

This new technique allowed any type of Xbox 360 (no matter its update installed) to run an arbitrary version of the Hypervisor, just like the SMC/JTAG hack, except that it will now need an <strong>external chip</strong> soldered in.</p><p>In a nutshell, RGH exploits a fundamental flaw in the CPU’s circuitry: if the CPU receives a short pulse (10 to 60 ns long) on its <code>RESET</code> line, the CPU will not fully reset but continue execution in a corrupted state, and that can work in the hacker’s advantage if the CPU is in the middle of asserting something crucial, like verifying the bootloaders. Additionally, user ‘cjak’ found out that by latching a special line in the motherboard called <code>CPU_PLL_BYPASS</code>, the CPU is slowed down to <strong>~25 MHz</strong>, thereby making room to glitch it.</p><p>With this, GliGli and a group of hackers grabbed a generic but fast CPLD board (similar to an FPGA), soldered it to many useful points on the motherboard and programmed it to:</p><ol><li>Keep track of the Xbox’s POST signals to know when and where to latch the buses.</li><li>Slow down the CPU when CB is about to validate CD’s hashes.</li><li>Latch the <code>RESET</code> line when CB is in the middle of a <code>memcmp()</code> function (related to the hash verification).</li><li>Revert the CPU’s original speed and hope that the <code>memcmp()</code> has magically succeeded.</li><li>If the process worked, a custom payload is executed.</li></ol><p>With this, a board programmed to glitch the Xbox 360’s CPU became known as a <strong>glitcher</strong>.</p><p>Because the process relies on correct timings (from a combination of POST inputs and hardcoded timers) and very precise signalling, success is not guaranteed anymore. Although to automate the process, the SMC’s firmware is altered to keep rebooting the console if the boot stage has failed.</p><p>And with this, the homebrew community was gifted with an unfixable exploit to load homebrew.</p></div><div id="tab-23-2-microsofts-retaliation"><h4 id="tab-23-2-microsofts-retaliation">Microsoft’s retaliation</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/photos/xcgpu.102181646044674154dcca3fab43dfdecbb2a639574be784d6919153b7dc5b53.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/photos/_hu42608983ccca5e73ac5059f7e105eead_237266_0cf21320674f877214b17a54c60617d8.webp 500w,

To tackle this, the RGH team found out they can fiddle with the PLL signal of the video encoder chip via I²C, and this will condition the speed of the CPU. Unfortunately, the video encoder can only slow it so much (just ~3 times <sup id="bibref:138"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-hacking_3" role="doc-biblioref">[138]</a></sup>) so the precision and success rate is reduced. Nonetheless, it’s still a huge accomplishment.</p><p>Additionally, Slim consoles split the CB stage into CB_A and CB_B, where CB_B is further encrypted with the RC4 algorithm and relies on the CPU key. To add more to the despair, the zero pairing backdoor got completely removed. Finally, all of these changes would soon be extended to older models as Microsoft publishes more software updates. Be as it may, hackers never gave up and found out they could modify CB_B in its encrypted form. Thanks to a mathematical flaw in RC4, encrypted information can be altered just by applying <code>XOR</code> with an unencrypted delta patch <sup id="bibref:139"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-hacking_3" role="doc-biblioref">[139]</a></sup>, thereby allowing to disable encryption routines on CB_B without knowing the CPU Key!</p></div><div id="tab-23-3-selling-rgh"><h4 id="tab-23-3-selling-rgh">Selling RGH</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/photos/squid.3b945c79e22928b943780467adc09d81eab505cd5a69c048c6d8f88aaf8159de.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/photos/_hu2e12797412432f2a595a8bcc01e3a371_185062_54573d30b6d689cab78d52ed4fd944c7.webp 500w,

Meanwhile, what remained was a good-old cat-and-mouse game, with Microsoft trying to make the task unfeasible. And so, new variants of RGH scattered across many forums to face the incoming wave of software updates. The variants shared the fundamentals of the RGH hack, but each used an alternative program for the glitcher and the modified SMC image to improve the success rates.</p><p>Initially, the RGH hack, as a program for the glitcher, materialised into two different variants: <strong>RGH1</strong>, which depended on the PLL line, and <strong>RGH2</strong>, which relied on the video encoder. The latter could be enjoyed by any motherboard revision and was continuously fixed to tackle Microsoft’s attempts to break it; and while RGH1 couldn’t get past old hardware (Trinity) and software (update <code>2.0.14699</code>), it enjoyed greater reliability.</p><p>In any case, the success of RGH paved a wave of commercial glitchers and installation kits. These promised that, at a higher price point, would provide easiness of installation and better success rates. I believe <strong>Team Xecuter</strong> is one of the best examples that greatly capitalised on the RGH fever. The company sold customised versions of Xilinx’s ‘CoolRunner’ development boards to compete against other programmable glitchers on the market. Most notably, Team Xecuter’s boards came either pre-programmed or with support for their new variants of RGH:</p><ul><li>As a result of Microsoft’s attempts to fix the XOR exploit with update <code>2.0.15572</code>, in December 2012, Team Xecuter shipped a new board called <strong>DGX</strong> (Double Glitch Hack) to focus on extracting the CPU Key <sup id="bibref:140"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-dgx" role="doc-biblioref">[140]</a></sup>, and then proceeding like any other RGH method. In this way, Microsoft’s update was addressed by flashing old unencrypted bootloaders and then using DGX to glitch the boot process <strong>twice</strong> to bypass both comparison and validation of the modified CB_B.</li><li>The <strong>R-JTAG</strong> glitcher for non-Slim consoles <sup id="bibref:141"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-rjtag" role="doc-biblioref">[141]</a></sup>. Released in May 2013, this new method for updated consoles attempts to approximate the old success rate of RGH1. Basically, R-JTAG glitches the CPU to load an old version of the Hypervisor vulnerable to the JTAG/SMC exploit, and then proceeds as the latter hack did.</li><li>With their new flagship ‘CR4 XL’ glitcher, <strong>RGH2+</strong> was presented as a new mode to improve over the classic RGH2. This time, the CPU slowdown process was delegated to the SMC <sup id="bibref:142"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-rgh_wiki" role="doc-biblioref">[142]</a></sup>.</li></ul><p>For one reason or another, Team Xecuter didn’t provide any documentation to replicate these new techniques on other devices. So users took matters into their own hands to deliver cheaper and/or better alternatives:</p><ul><li>First, ‘DrSchottky’ managed to create an open-source implementation of R-JTAG called <strong>R-JTOP</strong> for any glitcher to enjoy <sup id="bibref:143"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-rjtop" role="doc-biblioref">[143]</a></sup>.</li><li>Secondly, developer ‘blaKCat’ bundled the double-glitch routines in its flashing utility, so any board could be programmed without depending on the expensive DGX.</li><li>Thirdly, in December 2014, hacker ‘15432’ published the ‘Speedy RGH’ (<strong>S-RGH</strong>) <sup id="bibref:144"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-srgh" role="doc-biblioref">[144]</a></sup> as an alternative to CR4’s proprietary RGH modes. S-RGH even gained faster speed by reducing the slowdown periods during the glitching process.</li><li>Later on, in April 2015, 15432 did it again and published a new method called <strong>RGH 1.2</strong>, combining RGH2 and the use of the CPU’s PLL line <sup id="bibref:145"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-rgh12" role="doc-biblioref">[145]</a></sup>, achieving similar success rates to RGH1.</li><li>Finally, in August 2021, engineer Josh Davidson managed to port RGH 1.2 to Slims by finding the missing PLL line on the new motherboards <sup id="bibref:146"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-rgh12_slim" role="doc-biblioref">[146]</a></sup>, resulting in a new variant named <strong>RGH 1.2 V2</strong>.</li></ul></div></div></div><h4 id="the-endgame">The endgame</h4><p>With the approach of the Xbox 360’s successor, Microsoft took one last breath and shipped a redesigned version of the console called ‘E’, and within it, another motherboard revision called <strong>Winchester</strong>. The latter finally removed the POST signals and filtered the CPU <code>RESET</code> line from <em>external disturbance</em> <sup id="bibref:147"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-hack_win" role="doc-biblioref">[147]</a></sup>, which rendered the RGH hack, after three years since its discovery, obsolete.</p><p>However, for the compatible motherboards (which are still found in abundance), only <em>wonderful things</em> awaited. Apart from the mentioned RGH variants, there was still a golden discovery to be uncovered. Fast forward to November 2021, 15432 surprised the community again by publishing <strong>RGH 3.0</strong>, a universal RGH variant to rule them all. Behind the scenes, the new technique is an evolution of RGH 1.2 V2 that <strong>doesn’t require a glitcher anymore</strong> <sup id="bibref:148"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-rgh3" role="doc-biblioref">[148]</a></sup>. This was done by implementing the glitching stage into the SMC, which now only needs two wires soldered on the motherboard (in particular, POST and PLL) to execute the hack.</p><hr/><h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s all folks</h2><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/thatsall.b8b64f1d4aa1deb6d5d2c077a6af948e0d023fe81d7006c3d019528b53d08faa.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox360/_huf59e03110b0d7c6866daa4ccb18d6182_102031_16088ab538350670131dd53b39da2fcc.webp 500w,

Don’t get me wrong, I still consider Cell a great invention that brought many technical advancements to the consumer market, but I perceive its capabilities differed drastically compared to the rest of the chips in the PS3.

This later became a hit-and-miss challenge and, to make matters worse, my old one broke just before starting this site. Anyhow, at the end of the day I found myself surrounded with:</p><ul><li>An unused <strong>Xenon</strong> from 2005 that the owner was afraid to open the box.

I bought it to attempt to downgrade it to a Blades-era system, which turned out to be impossible without proper tools. Fortunately, thanks to the software provided by Octal’s Console Shop, it’s now straightforward to do so.</li><li>My old <strong>Trinity</strong> that I had since I was a teenager. Unfortunately, it got cursed with the Red Lights of Death and I couldn’t manage to repair it. Luckily, after RGH 3.0 came out, I bought a cheap spare Trinity, applied RGH and transplanted the internal Flash unit to recover my old profile and saves. All of the game screenshots in this article come from this model.</li></ul><p>With the write-up now finished, I’m glad I can finally put this search to rest. By the way, this is the last article of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/#7th-generation">7th generation saga</a>!</p><p>So, regarding my next steps, I’m considering returning to the 90s era to pay tribute to historical consoles that slipped my mind, or maybe do some more work on the site… we’ll see!</p><p>Until next time!</p></article></div>
