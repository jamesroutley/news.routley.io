The intent is to use this collaborative site for transformative science that will create a commercial pathway for large-scale, economically viable EGS. In collaboration with the National Energy Technology Laboratory, the EGS team worked tirelessly to set up the scope and schedule of this revolutionary undertaking. In April 2015, the Under Secretary for Science &amp; Energy announced selections of applicants and their candidate sites to compete for locating the new federal observatory. </span></p><p><span>*NEW*  </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-project-selections-first-phase-cutting-edge-enhanced-geothermal">ENERGY DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCES CANDIDATE SITE SELECTIONS!</a></p><h4>VISIT THE FORGE WEBSITE <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/node/925396" target="_self">HERE</a></h4><p>EGS are engineered reservoirs, created beneath the surface, where there is hot rock but limited pathways through which fluid can flow. During EGS development, the injection of fluid into the hot rock enhances the size and connectivity of fluid pathways by re-opening fractures. Once completed, EGS function just as natural geothermal systems do: fluids circulating through the hot rock carry energy to the surface through wells, driving turbines and generating electricity. EGS could provide up to 100+ GWe of economically viable capacity in the United States. This potential could supply green electricity to over 100,000,000 American homes, and represents a domestic energy source that is clean, reliable, flexible and renewable.</p><p>The FORGE initiative is comprised of three phases. The first two phases focus on selecting both a site and operations team, and preparing and fully characterizing the FORGE site. In Phase 1, $2 million will be available over one year for teams to perform analysis on the potential of their proposed site and to develop plans for Phase 2. Subject to appropriations, up to $29 million in funding is planned for Phase 2, during which recipients will work to fully instrument, characterize, and permit candidate sites. Phase 3 will fund full implementation of FORGE at a single site guided by a collaborative research strategy and executed via annual research and development solicitations designed to improve, optimize, and drive down the costs of deploying EGS. In this phase, partners from industry, academia, and the national laboratories will have ongoing opportunities to conduct research and development projects at the site enabling testing and evaluation of new and innovative EGS science, technology, tools, and techniques in critical research areas such as reservoir characterization, creation, and sustainability.</p><h4><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/articles/forge-infographic">Click here for a colorful infographic</a> to visualize the scope of this initiative.</h4><h4>CLICK <a href="https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/default.aspx#FoaId41b94a67-da2e-422d-8b51-08d8a5fddeae" target="_self">HERE</a> FOR A FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY</h4><h4>FOR NEWS ON FORGE DEVELOPMENTS CLICK <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/forge/initiative" target="_self">HERE</a></h4><h4>view the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/forge/forge-webinar-0">webinar slide presentation</a></h4></div>

Be sure to check back for more entries soon.</em></p><p>10. Geothermal technologies use the naturally occurring heat located in shallow ground, hot water and rock below the earth’s surface to generate electricity. Geothermal is considered a renewable source of energy because the earth’s core generates nearly unlimited heat.</p><p>9. The United States generates more electricity through geothermal energy than any other country in the world. The leading state -- California -- <a href="http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=geothermal_use">generates 79 percent of the nation’s geothermal electricity</a>.</p><p>8. With current geothermal technologies, electricity can be generated only where three key conditions are met: heat, fluid and natural permeability at depth. Small underground pathways conduct fluids through the hot rocks, carrying energy in the form of heat through wells to Earth’s surface, driving turbines and generating electricity.</p><p>7.  Breakthrough technology called Enhanced Geothermal Systems -- or EGS -- can generate electricity anywhere there is hot rock at depth, greatly expanding the potential for geothermal power in the United States.</p><p>6. EGS are man-made reservoirs created by drilling wells thousands of feet below the earth to access hot rock at the earth’s crust. Highly pressurized cold water is pumped through the wells to cause pre-existing fractures of the hot rock to open up, increasing permeability. This enables the water to flow through the cracked rock and pick up heat. The resulting hot water pumps back to the surface where it is depressurized to make steam, which spins a turbine to generate electricity. The water is then cooled and pumped through the wells again, repeating the same process and creating a closed-loop system. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/forge/enhanced-geothermal-systems">Check out this infographic to learn more about how EGS works</a>.</p><p>5. The Energy Department supports research and development at <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/enhanced-geothermal-systems-demonstration-projects">five active EGS demonstration projects</a> in Nevada, Idaho, Oregon and California.</p><p>4. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that EGS could provide 100 gigawatts of geothermal resource capacity in the United States -- enough to power about 100 million homes.</p><p>3.  EGS provides power around the clock and emits little to no greenhouse gases. The technology also allows for geothermal development outside of the western United States, where most hydrothermal resources are located.</p><p>2. The Energy Department’s future <a href="https://www.energy.gov/node/925396">Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy</a>, called FORGE, will be the first-of-its-kind field laboratory that will enable scientists and researchers to develop, test and accelerate breakthroughs in EGS technologies.</p><p>1. When it is fully implemented in 2020, FORGE will also allow researchers to collect and disseminate data in real time and identify low-risk, replicable pathways to commercial EGS development.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://www.energy.gov/node/925396">FORGE</a> and the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/enhanced-geothermal-systems-0">Energy Department’s work related to EGS</a>.
