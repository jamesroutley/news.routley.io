<p>When Remedy Entertainment announced the game&#39;s high system requirements, the internet couldn&#39;t help but let out a collective groan. The minimum specifications outlined were high, to say the least. It called for an <a title="Intel" href="https://www.xfire.com/tag/intel/">Intel</a> i5-7600K CPU and an RTX 2060 GPU with 16GB RAM for 1080p gameplay at 30 fps using the low graphics preset. Many had expressed their concerns about the requirements barring many from enjoying the title. However, this disappointment seems to have been based on a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Remedy&#39;s approach is to &#34;underpromise&#34; and &#34;overdeliver.&#34; Thomas Puha, Remedy&#39;s communications director, indicated via a tweet that the PC settings were on the safe side. This implies the studio wanted to ensure the game runs well on many systems, even those that barely meet the low-end specifications. While the company wanted to avoid overhyping and potentially disappointing players, it inadvertently generated some uncertainty about what to truly expect.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We played real safe on those PC settings btw. Underpromise, overdeliver, or something Finnish like that.</p>
<p>â€” Thomas Puha (@RiotRMD) <a href="https://twitter.com/RiotRMD/status/1717530515425693797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2023</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This speculation was further fueled by a deleted tweet from a Remedy developer, which highlighted potential issues with certain older GPUs like the <a title="Nvidia" href="https://www.xfire.com/tag/nvidia/">Nvidia</a> GTX 10-series and <a title="AMD" href="https://www.xfire.com/tag/amd/">AMD</a> RX 5000-series. But contrary to these reservations, tests conducted by <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/alan-wake-2-pc-performance/">Digital Trends</a> on various graphic cards showcased that the game offers commendable framerates, even on low-end GPUs.</p>
<p>Additional evidence supporting the game&#39;s scalability is seen in how the RTX 3070 GPU performs in comparison to the PS5&#39;s settings. With the game set to the PlayStation 5&#39;s performance mode, the RTX 3070 outperformed it by close to 50% at 1440p FSR2 Balanced. Further affirming the adaptability of Alan Wake 2, the &#34;medium&#34; preset, which raised eyebrows, includes settings set to high and ultra.</p>
<p>To many gamers&#39; relief, the game looks splendid on systems that meet the minimum requirements. Past titles from the studio, such as Control and Quantum Break, already proved the studio&#39;s commitment to <a href="https://www.xfire.com/remedy-entertainment-alan-wake-2-launch-trailer/">creating a visually appealing experience</a> even at the lowest settings. This commitment to quality visuals remains evident in Alan Wake 2, a game made with next-gen titles like the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X in mind. It isn&#39;t farfetched to say that Alan Wake 2, even at its lowest settings, outshines the maximum setting of others.</p>

<p>This is a testament to Remedy&#39;s efforts to create a game that squeezes the most out of the available hardware and the wonders of the studio&#39;s in-house Northlight engine.</p>
<p>However, it&#39;s essential to keep expectations in check. The game does push boundaries with its use of advanced features like mesh shaders, which makes a significant difference in performance. Comparatively newer cards like the RTX 2060 tend to outperform even powerful older GPUs like the GTX 1070 Ti and 1080 in Alan Wake 2 due to this.</p>
<p>Not all experiences are made equal. The game remains demanding, and for PCs at the minimum requirement threshold, the visuals and performance can vary. Performance might not drastically improve by switching to DLSS Performance mode either.</p>

<p>The duality of experience in Alan Wake 2 is pronounced based on the user&#39;s hardware. The game operates stably across a wide spectrum of machines. However, it unquestionably taxes lower-end hardware, often relegating them to sub 60 fps performance. Conversely, for those equipped with top-tier gaming rigs, Alan Wake 2 stands as a visual marvel. Features like path tracing and DLSS 3.5 create an immersive and aesthetically striking gaming environment.</p>
<p>While Alan Wake 2 stands out for its visual appeal, there does remain some minor hiccups, which include texture pop-in and some immersion-dampening bugs. It&#39;s hoped that Remedy will address these in subsequent updates.</p>
<p>Those fortunate enough to possess high-end systems are in for a visual treat with Alan Wake 2. But, <a href="https://www.xfire.com/fans-livid-alan-wake-2-pc-requirements/">it doesn&#39;t hide its beauty behind a paywall</a> - those with lower-end systems, provided it meets the bare system requirements, can still fully enjoy what Alan Wake 2 has to offer.</p>
