    <h1>The &#39;Batman Effect&#39;: How having an alter ego empowers you</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Is a self a centralized entity? Is it a society that includes both images of what is (“data”) and ideals about what ought to be (“schema”)?</p>
<p>Sometimes we feel decentralized or dispersed, as though we were made of many different parts with different tendencies: <em>“One part of me wants this, another part wants that. I must get better control of myself.&#34;</em> We sense feelings of disunity, conflicting motives, compulsions, internal tensions, and dissensions. We carry on negotiations in our head.</p>
<p>We also may have a single-view at times: <em>“I think, I want, I feel. It’s me, myself, who thinks my thoughts. It’s not some nameless crowd or cloud of selfless parts.&#34;</em> And the times we feel most reasonably unified can be just the times that others see us as the most confused.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-materials-paradigm-and-epochal-time/">an epochal time model</a>, a “self” - an identity – is a succession of images – of states; observers/processors may interpret the state-image data via a succession of contexts — of ideals / schema-versions.</p>
<p>Recent renewed interest in domain-team-driven distributed data-product governance, i.e. “data mesh”, may too be an expression of one-self-or-many tension.</p>
