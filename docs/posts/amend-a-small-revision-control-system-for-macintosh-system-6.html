    <h1>Amend – A small revision control system for Macintosh (System 6)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article>
	

<p>Amend is a self-contained revision control system that I wrote to keep track of
source code changes while working on other programming projects on my
<a href="https://jcs.org/system6c">Macintosh Plus</a>.
I made a
<a href="https://jcs.org/2021/10/22/amend">video</a>
about its development.</p>

<p>It is written for System 6, though it will probably run on System 7+ but I have
not tested it.</p>

<p>Amend is open source software released under an ISC license.
See the <code>LICENSE</code> file contained in the distribution for copyright and
licensing terms.</p>

<h2 id="latest-update-amend-32-released-2022-02-03">Latest Update: Amend 3.2 Released (2022-02-03)</h2>
<p><a href="https://jcs.org/amend">Amend 3.2</a>
has been released:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://jcs.org/amend/amend-3.2.sit">amend-3.2.sit</a> (StuffIt 3 archive, includes source code
and THINK C 5 project file)</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes in this version:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When filtering out already-added files, also filter out the open repo file
itself</li>
  <li>Fix a possible crash after committing</li>
  <li>Stop occasionally displaying a cursor on read-only text boxes such as diffs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="repo-browser">Repo Browser</h2>

<p>Each project handled by Amend is contained in a single “repo” database file.
A repo file must currently reside in the same directory as the files it is
managing.
When starting Amend without having double-clicked a repo from the Finder, one
is prompted to choose a repo file.
To create a new repo, cancel out of the <em>Open</em> dialog and choose <em>File</em> -&gt; <em>New
Repo</em>.</p>

<p>Once a repo has been opened, the main browser interface of Amend is displayed:</p>

<div>
	<p><a href="https://jcs.org/images/-amend-browser-large.png"><img src="https://jcs.org/images/-amend-browser-512x342.png" srcset="/images/-amend-browser-512x342.png 1x, /images/-amend-browser-1024x684@2x.png 2x" width="512" height="342"/></a>
	</p>
</div>

<p>On the left are the list of files; each file being managed must be added
through the <em>Repo</em> -&gt; <em>Add File</em> menu option.
In this dialog, files outside of the repository’s directory and files that
already exist in the repository are hidden.</p>

<p>On the top right are a list of commits.
As files are selected on the left, the list of commits is narrowed down to only
those that included the selected files.</p>

<p>Once a commit has been selected, the author, date, commit message, and diff
text are shown in the bottom section.</p>

<h2 id="committing">Committing</h2>

<p>After selecting one or more files, or leaving the default “[All Files]”
selected, clicking <em>Generate Diff</em> will bring up the diff/commit window.
As each selected file is compared to the previous version stored in the repo
and found to be differing, a unified context diff is appended to the text box
on the bottom.</p>

<div>
	<p><a href="https://jcs.org/images/-amend-commit-large.png"><img src="https://jcs.org/images/-amend-commit-512x342.png" srcset="/images/-amend-commit-512x342.png 1x, /images/-amend-commit-1024x684@2x.png 2x" width="512" height="342"/></a>
	</p>
</div>

<p>Once diffing is complete, a log message must be entered and then the <em>Commit</em>
button can be clicked.
Each differing file’s contents are updated in the repo and the commit
timestamp, author, date, and diff text are stored.
The diff/commit window is closed and the list of commits in the browser is
updated.</p>

<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>

<p>The author/username used for new commits, as well as the tab width can be
adjusted in the Settings menu.
These are global options stored in the program’s resource file, and are not
unique per-repo since repos can be shared.</p>
