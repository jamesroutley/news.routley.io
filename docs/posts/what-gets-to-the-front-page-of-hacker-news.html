    <h1>What gets to the front page of Hacker News?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img src="https://randomshit.dev/images/hacker-news/front-page.png"/></p>
<p>In my job as technical writer / marketer<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>, the most common question I get from companies I work with is “how do we get to the front page of Hacker News?” And as someone whose writing has been on said front page many times, I’ll tell you: <strong>I have no clue!</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it seems like good, high quality writing always finds its way to the front page; other times, it feels like the mods are out to get you. So I started (very manually) collecting data on what the top 30 posts on HN are at the end of any given day.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights (FP = Front Page):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog posts</strong> (45%) are the most popular type of content on the FP</li>
<li>A blog post from a <strong>corporate entity</strong> only has a 8% shot at making the FP</li>
<li>25% of FP posts are blog posts from engineers on their <strong>personal blogs/sites or OSS</strong></li>
<li>36% of FP posts are <strong>news articles</strong>, and the (slight) majority of them are actually not about software/hardware</li>
<li>ShowHN posts almost never make the front page (&lt;2%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the breakdown more visually:</p>
<p><img src="https://randomshit.dev/images/hacker-news/top-30-by-category.png"/></p>
<p>Before some more analysis and a few more charts, I want to preface this post by saying that I don’t mean to comment on the <em>inherent value</em> of getting your content to the front page of Hacker News. Whether this is the right goal, or if perhaps you should pursue a different goal like number of upvotes, or maybe comments, or maybe <em>angry</em> comments, is a discussion for another post.</p>
<h2>How I gathered and categorized the data</h2>
<p>The way I gathered this (small) data set was by manually<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> combing through the top 30 posts on Hacker News using the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front"><code>past</code></a> feature. For each post, I clicked on the link to see what the content was about, who published it, and where. Partially in advance, and then partially on the fly the more stuff I saw, I classified each post into a category. Since my main focus is technical writing and marketing, the categories I chose relate to that lens:</p>
<ul>
<li>News / opinion articles in media publications</li>
<li>Academic journals and papers</li>
<li>Blog posts
<ul>
<li>Personal blog vs. a corporate blog vs. an open source entity</li>
<li>Types of content: tutorials, thought leadership, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hiring announcements</li>
<li>ShowHN</li>
<li>Misc.
<ul>
<li>Repo links</li>
<li>Non-blog websites</li>
<li>Tweets, Reddit posts, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These categories have excellent coverage (Misc. &lt;5%) despite them being oddly specific. You can see that I wasn’t particularly concerned with the <em>subject matter</em> per se (everything is about Rust anyway) but more the format and the authoring entity.</p>
<p>The astute reader will note several limitations of the data set. </p>
<p>First, the data I collected represents what <em>finished</em> the day on the front page of Hacker News. But many items will <em>be</em> on the front page over the course of a given day, and then end the day somewhere else (perhaps number 35, or 67). What “gets to” the front page – a group that contains, and exceeds the size of, what “ends” on the front page - is a richer data set but I do not have access to it / it may not exist.</p>
<p>Second, and perhaps more importantly, the dataset doesn’t record the <em>attempts</em> made to get to the front page, i.e. all posts on Hacker News in a given day. It’s possible that there are orders of magnitude more blog posts <em>posted</em>  but fewer that <em>make</em> the FP, whereas 95% of any academic paper submitted makes the front page (extreme figures used for illustrative purposes). So for simplicity, I’ll say “the likelihood of making the FP” which assumes a constant rate of conversion from post to FP across different categories.</p>
<p>Limitations aside, the results started to converge very clearly after only 5 or 6 days of data, although there were a few outlier days with spikes in a particular category. In total I collected and sifted through 30 days worth of data, and hope to add more in the future.</p>
<h2>What kinds of blog posts get to the front page?</h2>
<p>Statistically, your best shot of getting your writing to the front page of Hacker News is by writing something (with nothing to promote) on your personal website or blog. 26% of total FP posts are blogs like this, while only 11% of total FP posts (or 24% of FP <em>blog</em> posts) came from corporate<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> entities on their corporate blogs or websites. 20% of blog posts are from some sort of open source entity (usually launches).</p>
<p>On the subject of what to post, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">the Hacker News guidelines</a> say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one&#39;s intellectual curiosity.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and this is pretty much the story with what blog posts make the FP. </p>
<p><img src="https://randomshit.dev/images/hacker-news/blog-posts.png"/></p>
<p>Of those corporate blog posts, about 40% of them are product announcements or launches; the rest are less promotional content formats like technical tutorials. A common question I get is “how do we get our product launch on the front page of HackerNews?” and the answer is that it’s statistically<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> highly unlikely (~4%) for that to happen. And of those product announcements that made the FP, a good deal of them are (a) from established companies and products like Apple, (b) posted organically by the community, and (c) about hardware and gaming. Not your software startup.</p>
<p>Personal blog posts, though, are highly popular on the FP. They span the gamut from tutorials to “how I built ___” type posts, and of course the perennial “I made a thing.” Here are a few examples of personal blog posts that made the FP:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tavianator.com/2023/futex.html">You could have invented Futexes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jingnanshi.com/blog/groebner_basis.html">Use Gröbner Bases To Solve Polynomial Equations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.milanvit.net/post/my-ultimate-shell-setup-with-fish-shell-and-tmux/">My ultimate shell setup with Fish shell and Tmux</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ariadne.space/2023/04/13/writing-portable-arm64-assembly/">Writing portable ARM64 assembly</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The common thread is that they’re non-promotional, and typically focus on a personal pursuit of the author<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>My personal experience writing for corporate entities says that useful tutorials and interesting stories do the best. The most recent post I wrote that made it to #1 was a tutorial for PlanetScale about how database sharding works (HN post <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35476518">here</a>). A few others I wrote that made the FP were all non-promotional:</p>
<ul>
<li>My two stories for Retool about why Accenture (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26969364">link</a>) and Oracle (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29004597">link</a>) are worth so much money</li>
<li>My blog post for WorkOS about best practices for building webhooks (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26401838">link</a>)</li>
<li>My “thought leadership” for PlanetScale about DBA experience (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28330297">link</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These successes live next door to a massive graveyard of blog posts I’ve written that <em>I</em> thought were really good, but Hacker News did not. Or perhaps randomness just reared its ugly head. </p>
<h2>What kinds of news gets to the front page?</h2>
<p>The second biggest category of posts that make the front page of Hacker News is (shocker) news, which I define here as a story or opinion piece published by a media organization. 36% of FP items are news, which is a lot!</p>
<p>While almost all of the news that makes the FP is STEM related, the majority of it (well, by a few percentage points) doesn’t relate to software or hardware. There are a lot of articles about space exploration and rockets, biology and chemistry, and physics, but fewer about code and SaaS and things like that. </p>
<p><img src="https://randomshit.dev/images/hacker-news/news.png"/></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that I didn’t see a single article from TechCrunch in the entire dataset I gathered, despite there being plenty of articles for places like the Verge, Wired, etc. A cursory search using <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=techcrunch&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story">Algolia’s Search HackerNews tool</a>, ordered by number of upvotes, reveals that HackerNews really does not like TechCrunch very much.</p>
<p><img src="https://randomshit.dev/images/hacker-news/techcrunch.png"/></p>
<h2>Miscellaneous findings and other things</h2>
<p>6% of items on the front page are academic papers, which is more than I thought.</p>
<p>ShowHN is very valuable, but is not likely to land your product on the front page.</p>
<p>Tweets and tweet threads sometimes make the front page.</p>
<p>It’s uncommon for hiring or launch posts - the two types of posts that are reserved for YC companies, and “artificially” promoted by moderators - to make the front page.</p>
<p>You can access the underlying dataset <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iUYmm4PRFbRi6KmDztRyCDiaHOLjsze4zT6Ts4-qbxk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>I want to thank <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir">Max Woolf</a> (who may recall interviewing me for a Data Science job at Buzzfeed that I thankfully did not take) for the excellent <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/hacker-news-undocumented">“Hacker News Undocumented”</a> resource. It was tremendously helpful. </p>
