			    <p>I was doing nothing the other day and I had the revelation – I finally figured out how to do nothing.</p>
<p>I used to have no idea how to do nothing and couldn’t understand how people do it. Now, I can just … nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing is not the same as meditating. It’s also not watching TV, or some other activity we call “nothing”.</p>
<p>When I do nothing there’s a bit of an emptiness, and I can slip into depression from doing it. When I’m not depressed, chilling with the cats or feeling the breeze on my skin is really nice.</p>
