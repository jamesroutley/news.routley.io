    <h1>Ask HN: In which areas have you compared 3&#43; tools and formed strong preferences?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>For example:</p><p>I&#39;ve used 3+ code editors on MacOS and prefer sublime text over VScode, coteditor, xcode.</p><p>I&#39;ve used Chrome, Firefox and Safari all within the past year, and I prefer Chrome and Safari.</p><p>I&#39;ve used 3+ voice transcription apps, the ones I prefer are &#39;just press record&#39; and Otter.ai, I can&#39;t remember the names of the others I used - but I downloaded a bunch of Whisper based ones and non-whisper based ones on the iOS app store.</p><p>I&#39;ve used 3+ messaging apps, I like iMessage and Telegram, I prefer those over Signal and WhatsApp.</p><p>I&#39;ve used 3+ interfaces for GPT, and I prefer the OpenAI playground over ChatGPT, chatbot-ui, typingmind, openplayground, Poe, and a few others I can&#39;t remember.</p><p>I think it&#39;s important to note that for me these are all preferences. I&#39;m not saying one of these tools are objectively better. I am saying that for me they are better, and I prefer them.</p><p>What are areas of products, tools, developer tools, APIs, anything, where you&#39;ve personally used 3+ tools, and what did you prefer, and what did you not prefer, if you can still remember?</p></div></div></div>
