            <p>
              It doesn’t matter if <em>you</em> have <em>“nothing to hide”</em>.
              Privacy is a right granted to individuals that underpins the
              freedoms of expression, association and assembly; all of which are
              essential for a free, democratic society.

              that “if you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to fear”
              purposefully misframes the whole debate.
            </p>

            <p>This affects all of us. We must care.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because
                you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t
                care about free speech because you have nothing to say.

              Your
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_expression">freedom of expression</a>
              is threatened by the surveillance of your internet usage – thought
              patterns and intentions can be extrapolated from your website
              visits (rightly or wrongly), and the knowledge that you are being
              surveilled can make you less likely to research a particular
              topic. You lose that perspective, and your thought can be pushed
              in one direction as a result. Similarly, when the things you write
              online, or communicate privately to others, are surveilled, and
              you <a href="#self-censorship">self-censor</a> as a result, the
              rest of us lose your perspective, and the development of further

              is threatened by the tracking of your location by your mobile
              phone. Can we afford to risk the benefits of free association, the
              social change brought by activists and campaigners, or the right
              to protest?
            </p>

            <p>
              These freedoms are being eroded, right now. The effects will
              worsen over time, as each failure to exercise our freedom builds
              upon the last, and as more people experience the

              be <em>aggregated</em> into a telling profile, which might include

              In the case of data retention in Australia, we have given away our
              rights to privacy, and now share a constant stream of:

            </p>

            <p>
              The intrusion becomes all the more spectacular when you consider
              the data across a whole population, the

            <p>
              Your interactions with the world around you can reveal your

              Given enough data and time, your behaviour might even be

              When you understand the fullness of the picture that mass
              surveillance paints of you, you begin to change your behaviour –
              you avoid exercising certain freedoms.
            </p>

            <p>You might think twice about:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>contacting</strong> or meeting people (exercising your
                  freedom of association) who you think might become “persons of
                  interest” to the state, or that you think the algorithms might
                  determine as such in the future, since you know that your
                  association with them is retained for <em>at least</em> two
                  years and may be analysed,
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>

                  of those people (exercising your freedom of assembly). Would

                  <strong>participating</strong> in any activity that might make
                  you look bad in the data – even if you know that you are
                  innocent. This could mean avoiding writing about a particular
                  topic online, or visiting a particular website, or buying a
                  particular book – exercising your freedom of expression.

            <p>
              The combined result of these second thoughts across the population
              is a chilling effect on many of the activities that are key to a
              well-functioning democracy – activism, journalism, and political
              dissent, among others.
            </p>

            <p>
              We all benefit from progress that occurs when activists,
              journalists and society as a whole are able to freely engage in
              political discourse and dissent. Many of the positive changes of
              the last century were only possible because of these freedoms. For
              example, the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_referendum,_1967_(Aboriginals)">1967 referendum</a>
              on including indigenous Australians in the census, and allowing
              the federal government to make laws specifically benefiting
              indigenous races, was only made possible by sustained activism
              throughout the 1950s and 60s.

              <a href="https://www.pen.org/sites/default/files/Chilling%20Effects_PEN%20American.pdf">A 2013 survey of US writers</a>
              found that after the revelations of the NSA’s mass surveillance
              regime, 1 in 6 had avoided writing on a topic they thought would
              subject them to surveillance, and a further 1 in 6 had seriously
              considered doing so.

                vulnerable. Surveillance is not about safety, it’s about power.
                It’s about control.

            <p>
              By creating databases and systems of easy access to such a great
              volume of personally revealing information, we increase the scope
              of mass surveillance, and therefore the scope for infringements
              upon our human rights.

            <p>
              East Germany is the most extreme example of a surveillance state
              in history. The Stasi – its infamous security agency – employed
              90,000 spies and had a network of at least 174,000 informants. The
              Stasi kept meticulous files on hundreds of thousands of innocent
              citizens and used this information to psychologically harrass,
              blackmail and discredit people who became dissenters. But that was
              before the internet. Reflecting on the NSA’s current systems of
              mass surveillance, a former Stasi lieutenant colonel
              <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article24750439.html">said</a>:

              This is most dangerous for the most vulnerable people. For
              example, if you have an angry or violent ex-partner, you could be

            <p>
              Our “digital lives” are an accurate reflection of our actual
              lives. Our phone records expose where we go and who we talk to,
              and our internet usage can expose almost everything about
              ourselves and what we care about.
            </p>

            <p>
              Even if we trust the motives of our current governments, and every
              person with authorised access to our data, we are taking an
              incredible risk. The systems of surveillance that we entrench now
              may be misappropriated and misused at any time by future
              governments, foreign intelligence agencies, double agents, and
              opportunistic hackers.

              Each system of surveillance and intrusion that we introduce erodes
              our privacy and pushes us one step further away from a free
              society.
            </p>

            <p>
              While you may not have noticed the impact yet, your privacy has
              already been eroded. If we continue along our current path,
              building more powers into our systems of surveillance, what was
              once your private life will be whittled away to nothing, and the
              freedoms that we have taken for granted will cease to exist.
            </p>

            <p>
              As technology advances, we are presented with a choice – will it
              to continue to offer an overall benefit to society, or will we
              allow it to be used as a tool for total intrusion into our lives?
