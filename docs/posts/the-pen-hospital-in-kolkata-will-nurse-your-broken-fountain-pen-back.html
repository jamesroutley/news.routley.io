    <h1>The Pen Hospital in Kolkata will nurse your broken fountain pen back</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>“You’ve not been taking proper care of your <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/i-wasnt-thinking-of-going-to-therapy-until-an-expert-told-me-this" target="_blank">pen</a>,” Muhammad Imtiaz grumbles while treating his latest patient—and the victim of my negligence—a Gold Leaf Jinhao fountain pen. As much as I would like to claim that I purchased this pen in pursuit of finer calligraphy, the truth is that an attractive <a href="https://www.vogue.in/promotion/for-love-layering-this-winter-explore-the-seasons-favourite-plus-ones" target="_blank">discount</a> online made me snap it up. After two months of blotting through numerous notebooks and sporting ink-stained hands, I had severely damaged the ink socket. Not wanting to lay it to rest yet, I took my ailing pen to the only place in the city where I knew it could be nursed back to health—the Pen Hospital. Situated in the heart of central Kolkata and hidden amongst vintage bars, ramshackle buildings and the famous Metro cinema of Chowringhee, the 77-year-old Pen Hospital is a relic of the past. It was established in the late ’50s by Imtiaz’s grandfather, Muhammad Samsuddin, along with a few other <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/i-got-a-lash-lift-and-its-not-what-i-expected" target="_blank">technicians</a>, all skilled in the mechanics of fountain pens.</p><figure><p><span><p>Photographed by Munjarita Mondal</p>

He looks up, a frown on his face. “Fountain pens are a labour of love. If you don’t have the time to care for them, perhaps a roller pen would suit you better.” I smile sheepishly at his barely disguised taunt. He shakes his head, then he goes on to explain how the excess ink in a fountain pen needs to be washed off with clean water at least once a week. In a flourish of movements, he shows me how to hold the nib with the appropriate amount of pressure against the paper to create a clear ink flow. He makes me practise on a notepad until he feels confident in my ability to hold the pen correctly. Then, the pen doctor writes me a prescription and charges a fee of only ₹50 for his consultation.</p><figure><p><span><p>Photographed by Munjarita Mondal</p>

</span></p></figure><p>An <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/here-are-5-reasons-why-cartiers-new-home-in-mumbai-is-a-living-monument-to-its-illustrious-legacy" target="_blank">establishment</a> dedicated to fixing and selling fountain pens may sound anachronistic in an era that becomes more digital with each passing day. Besides, for those who need it, stationery can easily be brought for loose change. “For my customers, fountain pens are not just <a href="https://www.vogue.in/promotion/discover-the-perfect-backdrop-for-your-dream-wedding-at-this-mumbai-based-luxury-hotel" target="_blank">stationery</a>,” Imtiaz scoffs. “It is a personal belonging that they hold onto and pass down as heirlooms.” He digs out a fountain pen from under his cabinet, neatly wrapped in white paper with its owner’s initials written on it. “This is a vintage Waterman model that costs well over ₹20,000. The owner has trusted me to fix it,” he says, the pride in his voice unmistakable. I peer over the glass cabinet and find box upon box of fountain pens neatly stacked in a row, each wrapped in a paper detailing their owner’s name and address, waiting to be discharged. “In my <a href="https://www.vogue.in/fashion/content/who-is-nicolas-di-felice-the-new-man-at-courreges" target="_blank">grandfather’s</a> time, pen mechanisms were simple. One simply had to fix the nib or add a socket and make small changes to the body parts,” explains Imtiaz. “Now it’s more complex. We often have to contact the companies and ask them to send us branded parts to fix these pens”.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><figure><p><span><p>Photographed by Munjarita Mondal</p>

</span></p></figure><p>There was a time when fountain pens were ubiquitous writing instruments, used by everyone from businessmen and students to professors and shopkeepers. “In the past, people purchased fountain pens out of necessity,” recalls Imtiaz. “That changed in the early ’2000s when ball pens and roller pens took over the market. Eventually, all the big companies like Pilot, Caravan, <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/ncuti-gatwa-on-doctor-who-the-doctor-twirling-in-a-kilt-to-edm-is-something-we-need-to-see" target="_blank">Doctor</a>, Artist and Wilson shut down their factories in India.” If the Pen Hospital has managed to survive it is by the grace of a dedicated customer base.</p><figure><p><span><p>Photographed by Munjarita Mondal</p>

</span></p></figure><p>During the exam season and on occasions like Teacher’s Day, the Pen Hospital receives a footfall of over ten to fifteen people. On slower days, Imtiaz and his nephew can be found at the shop front, fixing up clients’ fountain pens while a table fan whirs tirelessly. The shelves are stacked with cartons of fountain pens, ink pots and cleaning equipment. At the Pen Hospital, there is a fountain pen with a customised nib for every purpose. Imtiaz shows me the writing style of fine, medium, broad, double board and flex nibbed fountain pens and points out which one is meant for calligraphy, stenography, sheet music, Devanagari script and Urdu script. I find myself drawn to a pen with an elegant, swan-like neck. He follows my gaze and announces, “This is the lady nib,” named after the fact that the nibs are curved to fit into women’s hands which are typically smaller. “Waterman first came out with these nibs back in the ’30s,” he continues. “Since then, Hero, Parker and a few other Korean and Japanese brands have come up with their own interpretations of the lady nib at a much cheaper price.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><figure><p><span><p>Photographed by Munjarita Mondal</p>

</span></p></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>As I examine the lady nib, a middle-aged woman with <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/short-hair-are-the-celebrity-approved-haircut-this-season-perfect-for-rainy-weather" target="_blank">short hair</a> and a large office bag comes up to the shop front. “Imtiaz da,” she beseeches, “can you please take a look at this fountain pen?” He welcomes her in, asking about a fountain pen he had recently fixed for her. Then he introduces her to me as Pritha Mukherjee, an <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/what-happens-when-a-sabyasachi-show-blends-with-rare-vintage-cars" target="_blank">employee</a> at the nearby City Corporation building. “My father was a regular for the last 20 years,” Mukherjee tells me. “I mostly come here because my son loves collecting fountain pens.” Leaving us to our conversation, Imtiaz busies himself with what he calls the “tricky socket” of Mukherjee’s clear fountain pen. At this point, I too decide to take my leave, dreading the 5pm office rush which will follow me from Chowringhee, all the way to the metro ride home. As I walk out, the pen doctor looks up from his work and calls out dutifully: “Wash the <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/ariana-grandes-halloween-ready-beauty-look-is-a-lesson-in-chic-liner" target="_blank">socket</a> at least once a week.”</p><figure></figure><h2><strong>Also read:</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/kanan-gill-is-more-excited-about-writing-movies-than-acting-in-them" target="_blank"><em>Kanan Gill is more excited about writing movies than acting in them</em></a></p><p><a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/the-18-most-anticipated-indian-books-of-2024" target="_blank"><em>The 18 most-anticipated Indian books of 2024</em></a></p><p><a href="https://www.vogue.in/gallery/best-comedy-movies-of-all-time-that-will-have-you-crying-with-laughter" target="_blank"><em>51 best comedy movies of all time that will have you crying with laughter</em></a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
