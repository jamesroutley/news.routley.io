<p>Today is day 3 of my 30 day solidity journey with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth" target="_blank">https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth</a></p>



<p>I finally deployed a contract</p>

<p>I changed my process</p>



<p>I was tired and kept it simple.</p>



<p>I fired up 3 iterms, set an alias to my directory and ran my three yarn commands: yarn build, yarn start and yarn deploy</p>



<p>I wanted to avoid the proliferation of node processes I had yesterday</p>



<p>I replaced the current YourContract.sol via cut and paste from the primitives data point sample.</p>



<p>Then I ran yarn deploy AND IT FAILED</p>



<p>The default version of hardhat was using a different version of solidity.</p>



<p>So I edited the config and updated it to use the version in my contract</p>



<p>yarn deploy AGAIN and SUCCESS</p>



<p>What did I learn?</p>



<p>Sometimes when you do the least you make the most progress, but only if you have been making progress every day along the way.</p>
