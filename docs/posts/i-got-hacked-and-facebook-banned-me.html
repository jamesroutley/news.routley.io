    <h1>I got hacked and Facebook banned me</h1>

<p>What do you think happens if your personal Facebook profile gets hacked? Until last week I naively thought it would be a simple matter of letting Meta know, and them helping me reclaim my accountâ€¦ The actual process has been upsettingly opaque.</p>

<h3 id="tldr-i-let-an-old-domain-expire-and-an-attacker-got-me-banned-from-facebook">TLDR; I let an old domain expire and an attacker got me banned from Facebook.</h3>



<p>The attacker has since put up content that has had my account suspended, to be deleted within 30 days. What I have discovered is that there is no way to speak to anyone at Facebook about this, no way to get your account reinstated, no way to get the photos, connections and memories back. I have gone from a regular Facebook user (15 years with a profile) to nothing. One bad actor is enough to erase you and Facebook do not give a damn.</p>

<h3 id="the-attack">The attack</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m still not sure how I ended up in the attackers crosshairs.</p>

<p>My best guess is that an old email <code><a href="https://emilycordes.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="30555d595c4970585140404944425555405f43551e535f5d">[emailÂ protected]</a></code> was involved in a <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">data breach</a>.</p>

<p>Years ago I had a blog called <em>Happy Tree Pose</em>, about yoga and other bits and pieces. Eventually I stopped writing it, and let the domain <em>happytreepose.com</em> expire. I had forgotten that Iâ€™d setup <code><a href="https://emilycordes.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="63060e0a0f1a230b0213131a17110606130c10064d000c0e">[emailÂ protected]</a></code> as a recovery email on my Facebook account. I switched across to a more current address 10 years ago, and didnâ€™t think that it would remain active.</p>

<p>The attacker must have had a list of emails and found mine with an expired domain.</p>

<p>They registered the domain using Wix, and then were able to reset my Facebook password.</p>

<p>I got no notification when their yubikey was added as the 2nd factor authentication.</p>

<h3 id="they-tried-to-spend-my-money-on-ads">They tried to spend my money on ads</h3>

<p>They then started posting ads forâ€¦ Alaskan Crab Meat ðŸ¦€.</p>

<h3 id="their-spammy-ads-got-me-banned">Their spammy ads got me banned</h3>

<p>Eventually these strange spam ads got me banned. Account suspended pending review. To be deleted after 30 days.</p>

<p>If you view my profile now it simply says â€˜review requestedâ€™.</p>

<h3 id="countdown-to-deleted-account">Countdown to deleted account</h3>

<p>This all happened a week ago. This means I should have approx three weeks to get my account back before it is permanently deleted. I have tried emailing addresses I found online, with no reply or even receipt. I have filled in online forms that ask for my license but then give me no indication that this has been received. I have also searched the net and sadly found that I am not alone.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure what to do next. Everything is online, and requires you to login to your account. There is no way to contact support, no way to recover your memories when things go wrong. Thanks to one bad actor I no longer exist on Facebook. I have all the documents I need to prove my identity, and my old profile is full of pictures of meâ€¦ surely it shouldnâ€™t be this hard?</p>

<p>Perhaps I shouldnâ€™t care. I should take this as a chance to move off socials and find other ways to connect. Thing is Iâ€™m a Mum of two who has just moved to a new area. Facebook groups have offered me support and community, and Mums Iâ€™ve met in local playgrounds have added me as a friend so we can use messenger to plan playdates. Without these apps sadly my little social life becomes a lot lonelier, and harder.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-can-we-do">So, what can we do?</h3>

<p>Firstly, if you know anyone at Facebook would you please pass this on? I honestly donâ€™t know what else to doâ€¦</p>

<p>Perhaps this post can reach an actual person and they can help? Iâ€™d really love you to share this until I can find someone who actually has a face and a name and the ability to figure this out.</p>

<p>Second - go set up two factor authentication on all your accounts if you havenâ€™t already. I feel like a prize idiot for not doing so. Sure, I had a baby and had just moved house but ugh I wish I had taken a moment.</p>

<p>If you think you can help, you can contact me at <a href="https://emilycordes.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fd9890949184bd98909491849e928f99988ed39e9290"><span data-cfemail="1d78707471645d78707471647e726f79786e337e7270">[emailÂ protected]</span></a>. Thank you in advance.</p>
