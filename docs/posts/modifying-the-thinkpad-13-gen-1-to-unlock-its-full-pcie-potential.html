    <h1>Modifying the ThinkPad 13 Gen 1 to unlock its full PCIe potential</h1>

<p>A Few weeks ago i acquired a Thinkpad 13 Gen 1 on ebay, sold by a recycling company, it was listed for parts
and with the wrong model name in the title.</p>

<p>Some weeks later i decided to check out the boardview and schematic of the Lenovo laptop, to my unexperienced eyes nothing looked off and NVMe should have just worked, being that in the schematic
all the components for PCIe were present.
Talking to my friend who took a look at the files she pointed out that the design by Quanta,
is not exactly ideal as it would be when <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bassusteur/thinkpad13nvme/main/images/Screenshot_20240810_173600.png">correctly implemented for NVMe</a>, as they <a href="https://github.com/bassusteur/thinkpad13nvme/blob/main/images/image2.png">added extra components required in SATA-only configuration.</a>.
We later discovered that the specsheet listed SATA m.2 as the only <a href="https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/ThinkPad/ThinkPad_13/ThinkPad_13_Spec.PDF">storage option.</a></p>

<p>So enough talking done, i got to disassembling the laptop and getting down to desolder two capacitors, C224 and C237, and bridging them with some magnet wire,
it was kind of difficult but nothing some flux and holding a steady hand can’t fix.</p>

<p>Or.. not, Laptop reassembled, with a drive chucked from my main machine, i tried booting it up but no luck the drive would not show up in the bios entries nor linux, 
though as a tip from my friend i would apparently also need to bridge two other pads <a href="https://github.com/bassusteur/thinkpad13nvme/blob/main/images/image1.png">(PEDET and GND)</a> for the SSD to be detected, because despite the components being present on the boardview and schematic they were not ultimately placed during assembly.

<p>Preparing for what should be the final test i once again borrowed an ssd from my main laptop, which runs debian btw, painstakingly reseated the keyboard and 
booted the machine.</p>

<p>It worked! the ssd is now recognized with just a single lane which gets me approximately 1GB/s throughput, 
though UEFI won’t let me boot from it i can access the files from a live iso, so it could just be a matter of updating uefi entries for this machine or trying to install
an OS from scratch on a new drive.

<p>Update 30/09/2024: 
Booting from NVMe actually works, my initial mistake was not performing a clean install through the laptop, here’s a few images showing it booting and a drive speed benchmark:

<p>One last thing to notice is: the extra pcie lanes going to the slot all have capacitors that have not been populated, so if you wanted a speedier link you would have <a href="https://github.com/bassusteur/thinkpad13nvme/blob/main/images/355956864-ed5a1132-19c0-49bc-9205-d89726f15a3b.png">to solder them on as well</a>.</p>
