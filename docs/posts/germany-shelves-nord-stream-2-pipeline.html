    <h1>Germany shelves Nord Stream 2 pipeline</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									
<p>Germany is halting the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline in light of Russia’s incursion into Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said.</p>



<p>The undersea pipeline, meant to ferry natural gas directly from Russia to northern Germany, is owned by a subsidiary of Russia’s state-owned Gazprom. Berlin has previously been reluctant to impose sanctions that would affect Nord Stream 2.</p>



<p>But at a press conference Tuesday, Scholz said that “the situation today is fundamentally different and therefore, in light of recent events, we must also reassess this situation … also with regard to Nord Stream 2.”</p>



<p>He said he had asked the German economy ministry to withdraw a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2021/10/20211026-bmwi-uebermittelt-versorgungssicherheitsanalyse-im-zertifizierungsverfahren-nord-stream-2-an-bundesnetzagentur.html">binding opinion</a> from October last year that stated the pipeline posed no security-of-supply threats. </p>



<p>“This sounds technical, but it is the necessary administrative step so that no certification of the pipeline can now take place,” Scholz added. “And without this certification, Nord Stream 2 cannot go into operation.”</p>



<p>Shortly after, the economy ministry <a href="https://twitter.com/BMWK/status/1496095819598082052" target="_blank">announced</a> it was halting the certification process. </p>



<p>It was a surprise move from Scholz, who had at times avoided even mentioning the pipeline by name in recent days, and came after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into the self-declared &#34;people&#39;s republics&#34; of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine on Monday night.</p>



<p>Ukraine has long described the €10 billion project — whose construction was completed in September but has yet to start operating — as a threat to its security. Nord Stream 2 bypasses the country, and Kyiv had raised concerns that this would allow Russia to shut off gas transport via existing land pipelines, costing Ukraine billions in transit fees. </p>



<p>Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the decision. &#34;This is a morally, politically and practically correct step in the current circumstances,&#34; he <a href="https://twitter.com/DmytroKuleba/status/1496094461721550854?s=20&amp;t=AtBxKqW211pJAOa9LPDqKA" target="_blank">said</a>. &#34;True leadership means tough decisions in difficult times. Germany’s move proves just that.&#34;</p>



<p>Scholz, who was speaking at a press conference with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin, said Russia&#39;s move to recognize the separatist areas as independent was &#34;a serious breach of international law.&#34; </p>



<p>He added that the economy ministry — led by the Greens, which tend to have a hawkish stance toward Moscow — would draw up a new supply security report taking into account recent developments. </p>



<p>&#34;The certification cannot take place now,&#34; he <a href="https://twitter.com/Bundeskanzler/status/1496089904161378304" target="_blank">tweeted</a> later, signaling that while Berlin was freezing the project, it might get licensed at a later date. Full cancellation of the pipeline could leave the government vulnerable to lawsuits. </p>



<p>A spokesman for U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also welcomed the move. &#34;It&#39;s certainly it&#39;s something we&#39;ve said both in conversations and publicly repeatedly. Being dependent on Russian hydrocarbons in this way is not beneficial to Europe.&#34;</p>



<p>The decision comes as Europeans grapple with record-high power bills, driven in large part by a gas supply shortage. The Continent is heavily dependent on Russian gas, which accounted for more than <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bruegel.org/2022/01/can-europe-survive-painlessly-without-russian-gas/">42 percent</a> of EU imports via pipelines alone last year. </p>



<p>Former Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, reacted to Scholz’s decision by <a href="https://twitter.com/MedvedevRussiaE/status/1496112456858574849" target="_blank">pointing out</a> the EU’s dependency: “Welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay €2.000 for 1.000 cubic meters of natural gas!” </p>



<p>Prior to Scholz&#39;s announcement, Putin <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1997132">had said</a> that he has no intention of slashing exports to Europe. </p>



<p>A Nord Stream 2 spokesperson declined to comment. </p>
