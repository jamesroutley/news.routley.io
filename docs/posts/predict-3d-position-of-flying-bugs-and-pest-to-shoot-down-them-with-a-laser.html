<div><h3>- Contributes to technological development for pest extermination by high-power lasers -</h3>

<p>National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO) has developed a method to predict the pest flight position. This method can detect the three-dimensional position of flying pests from the image captured by the camera and predicts its movement. It is expected that this research result will contribute to the development of a new pest control system to exterminate pests, such as irradiating a high-power laser at the predicted position. </p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
NARO has succeeded in predicting the pest flight position by fusing the modeled flight pattern of the pest with the three-dimensional position calculated from the image captured by the stereo camera.</p></div>
