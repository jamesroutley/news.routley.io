    <h1>The FAANG Market Is Fading</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody text" data-v-7ba8d775="" data-v-8af833d2=""><div data-v-7ba8d775="" data-v-8af833d2=""> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">Heading into the final weeks of 2021, an important trend has emerged in the stock market: The hyper-concentration of returns that saw a handful of stocks responsible for much of the gains last year has faded.</p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">Some of the largest stocks in the market still dominate returns to a degree that&#39;s greater than in previous years. Case in point is Tesla <span data-v-8af833d2="">(<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/tsla/quote" tabindex="0" data-v-5db0bc77="">TSLA</a>)</span>, <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1068153/why-investors-cant-ignore-tesla" tabindex="0" data-v-5db0bc77="" data-v-8af833d2="">whose wild swings can shave returns</a> off funds that track broad market indexes, thanks to its current status as the fourth-largest stock. </p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">During 2020, the concentration of stock market returns reached a peak amid the pandemic-induced volatility. But the trend in 2021 has shifted toward a lesser degree of concentration of returns. For investors, this is a potentially healthier dynamic, with less risk for index-tracking funds and more opportunities for stock-pickers.</p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">Last year, the five largest stocks--Apple <span data-v-8af833d2="">(<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/aapl/quote" tabindex="0" data-v-5db0bc77="">AAPL</a>)</span>, Microsoft <span data-v-8af833d2="">(<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/msft/quote" tabindex="0" data-v-5db0bc77="">MSFT</a>)</span>, Amazon.com <span data-v-8af833d2="">(<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/amzn/quote" tabindex="0" data-v-5db0bc77="">AMZN</a>)</span>, Meta Platforms <span data-v-8af833d2="">(<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/fb/quote" tabindex="0" data-v-5db0bc77="">FB</a>)</span>, and Tesla--contributed a massive 37% of the market&#39;s returns. In contrast, this year through late November, the five largest stocks--the same group with the exception of Alphabet <span data-v-8af833d2="">(<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/goog/quote" tabindex="0" data-v-5db0bc77="">GOOG</a>)</span> taking the place of Meta--contributed just 8% of market returns. That compares with an average of 3% from 2009 through 2019. </p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">The actual FAANG stocks--Facebook (now Meta), Apple, Amazon, Netflix <span data-v-8af833d2="">(<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/nflx/quote" tabindex="0" data-v-5db0bc77="">NFLX</a>)</span>, and Google (now Alphabet)--have contributed 2.7% of returns in 2021, down from 24% in 2020.</p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">&#34;The unwinding of concentration is good for investors and the health of the market,&#34; says Dan Kemp, global chief investment officer at Morningstar Investment Management. &#34;Concentrated portfolios tend to be less robust to a change in the economic environment and have further to fall in the event of unexpected headwinds due their lofty valuations.&#34;</p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2=""><span data-v-3cf634da="" data-v-8af833d2=""><img src="https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18260.png" alt="" data-v-3cf634da=""/></span></p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">It&#39;s natural for there to be clusters of outperformance or underperformance in the markets. And when one of those clusters involves the largest stocks, that can have a significant impact because the largest companies make up the largest weights of the benchmarks <span data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">that are most widely tracked by index funds</span>.</p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">To measure just how concentrated stock returns have been, we calculated the impact that the 10 largest stocks have had on the Morningstar US Large-Mid Index, which essentially tracks 90% of the stock market. We took the 10 largest stocks at the end of each year going back to 2009, and using Morningstar Direct&#39;s equity attribution tool, excluded their returns from the index&#39;s performance and compared that number with each year&#39;s total return.</p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">In the following table, the concentration of returns can be seen across the readings for the largest stocks. For example, the three largest stocks accounted for less than 10% of returns in most years since 2009, and often just in the very low single digits. But in 2020, the three largest stocks were responsible for 27% of the market&#39;s returns. That figure dropped to 2% this year.</p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2=""><span data-v-3cf634da="" data-v-8af833d2=""><img src="https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18231.png" alt="" data-v-3cf634da=""/></span></p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">One quirk is that when the market has only a small move, such as 2015&#39;s 0.92% change, or is basically flat as it was in 2011, the results can be distorted. It&#39;s a similar story for the math in 2018, when the market was down but each of the 10 largest stocks rose. So, to create a more useful comparison point, we&#39;re excluding those three years from our long-term average.</p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">Overall, the picture for 2021 marks a meaningful change from 2020&#39;s dynamic and is closer to the long-term picture.</p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2=""><span data-v-3cf634da="" data-v-8af833d2=""><img src="https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18258.png" alt="" data-v-3cf634da=""/></span></p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">Drilling down into the underlying stocks shows the roots of the change. In 2020, Apple, with the top weighting in the index at 6.12%, rose 81.84%. At such a high weighing in the index, that meant Apple alone--out of 699 stocks in the Morningstar US Large-Mid Index--contributed 13% of the year&#39;s 20.9% gain. Add in Microsoft and Amazon, and more than one fourth of the year&#39;s return was accounted for by just those three stocks.</p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">This year, the concentration is less pronounced, even though the top five stocks are still providing above-average contributions to market returns. Microsoft, 2021&#39;s largest company with a market weighting of 5.75%, by itself contributed 9% of the market&#39;s 25.5% return as of Nov. 19. Apple, the next-largest stock in the index, returned 21.7%--a 4% contribution to the market&#39;s total. The third-largest stock, Amazon, returned 12.9%--contributing just 2% of the total.</p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2=""><span data-v-3cf634da="" data-v-8af833d2=""><img src="https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18233.png" alt="" data-v-3cf634da=""/></span></p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">&#34;This year has been a mild-mannered correction to the extremes of 2020,&#34; says Russ Kinnel, director of manager research at Morningstar. &#34;With a recovery and surprising economic growth and low unemployment, 2021 has been a great environment for value and everything that was dumped due to COVID.&#34; </p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">On the flip side, Kinnel says, these trends took some oxygen away from the FAANGs and other work-from-home stocks, but it was largely a correction via underperformance.</p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">Over most of the past decade, the proportion of market returns coming from the largest companies has steadily increased. In 2017, the largest five stocks contributed 9% of market&#39;s total returns, up from just 6% in 2016. And in 2019, the top 10 holdings contributed 10% of the market&#39;s annual return of 31%. </p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">Market concentration came to a peak in 2020 when the top five holdings alone contributed nearly 40% of the market&#39;s return for the year. This year, the largest five stocks have been responsible for 8% of market return, while the largest 10 stocks contributed a total of 20%.</p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2=""> <span data-v-3cf634da="" data-v-8af833d2=""><img src="https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18259.png" alt="" data-v-3cf634da=""/></span></p> <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-8af833d2="">Kinnel says that it&#39;s premature to call the FAANG market dead, but the year&#39;s relative cooldown of the largest stocks does show the market is behaving in a fairly rational way, &#34;even though meme stocks and crypto tell us there&#39;s still a lot of irrational behavior going on.&#34;<span aria-hidden="true" data-v-2a519662="" data-v-8af833d2=""><svg aria-hidden="true" data-v-2a519662=""><use xlink:href="/assets/img/mdc.6527c01.svg#end-mark"></use></svg></span></p></div></div><p data-v-7ba8d775="" data-v-8af833d2="">
