<p>The 10,000th game was recently played on bgammon.org, about nine months after
the first game. This article highlights some important contributions by
community members and documents the journey so far.</p>

<p>bgammon.org now hosts around 100 games of backgammon, acey-deucey and tabula
per day.</p>

<p>Many people have helped guide the development of bgammon.org, and I would like
to highlight two members of the community that have made important contributions.</p>
<p><strong>f-a</strong> has contributed numerous suggestions which have helped guide the
development of bgammon.org client and server. To name one, he suggested showing
checkers off of the board visually, by stacking them in groups beside the
board. He also has helped review blog posts before they are published.</p>
<p><strong>EGYT</strong> has also contributed numerous suggestions which have helped guide
development. He pushed for complete internationalization support in the
bgammon.org client and server, which has now been achieved. He also provided
helpful suggestions outside of internationalization.</p>

  Optimization

</h2>
<p>The official bgammon.org client, <a href="https://code.rocket9labs.com/tslocum/boxcars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boxcars</a>,
and the backgammon engine embedded within it, <a href="https://code.rocket9labs.com/tslocum/tabula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tabula</a>,
have both undergone extensive optimization. Some highlights include speed
improvements to application startup time, wrapping and rendering text boxes,
and loading and using Tabula to calculate moves.</p>
<p>These improvements are helpful everywhere, but are particularly noticeable for
web and Android users.</p>
<h2 id="ubei">
  UBEI
  <a href="#ubei">
    <i aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span>Link to heading</span>

</h2>
<p>I drafted and implemented the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D5xm7A1SbfuZo4vFWjqkIdpnGiJtOmKo-YCaoJmSsog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Universal Backgammon Engine Interface (UBEI)</a>.
The protocol has only been implemented at bgammon.org, but I hope to
collaborate with other software developers to make it easier to create and work
with backgammon engine software. Having a standard protocol shared across the
multiple pieces of software used to make bgammon.org work has been useful.</p>
<p>All of the bots on bgammon.org powered by Tabula use UBEI to communicate with a
single engine running on the server. This greatly reduces the resources used
when running multiple bots.</p>
<p>UBEI is also used in the ongoing development of Tabula via the <a href="https://code.rocket9labs.com/tslocum/bgammon-benchmark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bgammon-benchmark</a>
tool. This tool makes it easy to pit backgammon engines against each other and
score the results. Whenever changes are made to Tabula, the result is
benchmarked against another backgammon engine before going live. I like to test
against the <a href="https://github.com/carsten-wenderdel/wildbg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wildbg</a> backgammon engine.</p>

<p>I’ve learned a lot while developing bgammon.org, and I am happy with the
direction it is headed.</p>
<p>Here’s to the next 10,000 games.</p>
