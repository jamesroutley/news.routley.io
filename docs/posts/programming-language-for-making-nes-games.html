        <p>
                NESFab is a new programming language for creating 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">NES</a> games. 
                Designed with 8-bit limitations in mind, the language is more ergonomic to use than C, while also producing faster assembly code.
                It&#39;s easy to get started with, and has a useful set of libraries for making your first — or hundredth — NES game.

        <div>
            <pre>// This small program plays a sound effect.

// Variables:
vars /sound
    UU pitch = 1000

// Sends &#39;pitch&#39; variable to the APU, emitting sound:
fn play_sound()
    {$4015}(%100)
    {$4008}($FF)
    {$400A}(pitch.a)
    {$400B}(pitch.b &amp; %111)

mode main()
    {$2000}(%10000000)
    while true
        pitch *= 1.01
        play_sound()
        nmi</pre>

        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <div>
            <p>NESFab generates better 6502 machine code than any high-level compiler tested, including GCC and LLVM.
            It&#39;s possible that NESFab is the best performing 6502 compiler in existence.</p>

            <sup>(Click the image to open in a new tab.)</sup></p><p>
                Traditionally, NES games were written by hand in assembly language, 
                as anything else at the time was too sluggish to run on the 1980&#39;s era CPU.
                NESFab isn&#39;t sluggish though!
            </p>

        <h2>Automatic Bank Switching</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                The NES uses a 16-bit address space, 
                but most games need more data than 16-bits can represent.
                To overcome this limitation, 
                programs can be broken up into segments called &#34;banks&#34;,
                and hardware on the cartridge can switch between these banks
                at runtime.
            </p>
            <p>
                Handling banks is normally a tedious affair for programmers, 
                but NESFab handles it for you. 
                The compiler smartly allocates code and data into banks,
                with the gritty details abstracted away.

        <h2>Easy Asset Loading</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Writing a half-dozen conversion scripts isn&#39;t fun. Luckily, NESFab automates asset loading and conversion for you.
                Just plop your assets into your project directory, import a library, and you&#39;re rolling!

        <div>
            <p>The best way to get NESFab is by compiling it from the source, which will always be up-to-date. 
            For those who don&#39;t like compiling, binary releases will be provided from time to time.</p>

                <li><h3><a href="https://github.com/pubby/nesfab/releases">Binary Releases</a></h3></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please understand that NESFab is currently in beta, and likely has bugs and missing features.</p>
