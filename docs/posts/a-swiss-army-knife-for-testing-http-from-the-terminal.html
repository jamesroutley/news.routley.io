    <h1>Show HN: A Swiss army knife for testing HTTP from the terminal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Hiya HN!<p>Just released Artillery Probe - a Swiss army knife for testing HTTP from the CLI. Think mini-curl with better UX for common use-cases, plus a couple of extra features.</p><p>Would love for you to try it and give some feedback!</p><p>https://www.artillery.io/blog/swiss-army-knife-for-http-testing</p><p>and:</p><pre><code>  npm install artillery@latest
</code></pre>
What does it do?<p>- First of all, it&#39;s a HTTP client! It does all the usual stuff you&#39;d expect from a HTTP client... HTTP methods, request bodies, custom headers, forms, Basic Auth etc.</p><p>- Got some JSON or XML back? It&#39;ll pretty-print it, and syntax highlight it for you.</p><p>- It&#39;ll show you request waterfalls like this one: (inspired by httpstat)</p><pre><code>   DNS Lookup | TCP Connection | SSL Handshake | Time to First Byte | Content Transfer

- JSON responses can be queried and sliced and diced with JMESPath (same syntax as AWS CLI) - no need to reach for jq. XML &amp; HTML may be queried with a jQuery-like syntax too.<p>- You can set expectations on the response, e.g. have the CLI check that the response is a 200, or that a certain header is set, and exit with non-zero code if not. Super handy for quick acceptance testing.</p><p>We&#39;ve got lots of ideas for improvements, but would love to hear what you think!</p></div></div>
