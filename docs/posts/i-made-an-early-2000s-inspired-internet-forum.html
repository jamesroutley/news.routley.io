      <div><p>My recent posts have been more reflective compared to my first time at RC. I suppose it’s in line with this goal that I set out:</p><blockquote><p>I would be less of a perfectionist in sharing sketches of my blog post ideas along the way, instead of mostly finished piece towards the end.</p></blockquote><p>In re-applying to RC, I had a look at my Github history and noticed that 2024 would be <a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html">10 years</a> since my first pull request. Perhaps this is why, despite it being the first week of RC, I’ve been feeling a little low.</p><p>In the past year, I&#39;ve also realized my main hurdle has actually been soft skills. I’ve been working on building patience. With patience you can make better long-term plans and build relationships that compound. It helps you be the ‘responsible adult’. Cue <a href="https://twitter.com/mattklein123/status/1130206809308901376">Matt Klein</a>.</p><blockquote><p>One last thing: don&#39;t let anyone tell you that the tech/engineering is the easy part. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s hard. Soft skills are also hard. It&#39;s ALL hard, and both are required to succeed.</p></blockquote></div>
