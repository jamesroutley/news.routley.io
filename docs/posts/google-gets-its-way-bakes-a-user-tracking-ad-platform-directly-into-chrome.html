<p>Don&#39;t let <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/chrome-is-getting-a-big-redesign-with-rounded-corners-material-you-colors/">Chrome&#39;s big redesign</a> distract you from the fact that Chrome&#39;s invasive new ad platform, ridiculously branded the &#34;Privacy Sandbox,&#34; is also getting a widespread rollout in Chrome today. If you haven&#39;t been following this, this feature will track the web pages you visit and generate a list of advertising topics that it will share with web pages whenever they ask, and it&#39;s built directly into the Chrome browser. It&#39;s been in the news previously as &#34;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/everybody-hates-floc-googles-tracking-plan-for-chrome-ads/">FLoC</a>&#34; and then the &#34;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/google-drops-floc-after-widespread-opposition-pivots-to-topics-api-plan/">Topics API</a>,&#34; and despite widespread opposition from just about every non-advertiser in the world, Google owns Chrome and is one of the world&#39;s biggest advertising companies, so this is being railroaded into the production builds.</p>
<p>Google seemingly knows this won&#39;t be popular. Unlike the glitzy front-page Google blog post that the redesign got, the big ad platform launch announcement is tucked away on the <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-for-the-web-reaches-general-availability">privacysandbox.com</a> page. The blog post says the ad platform is hitting &#34;general availability&#34; today, meaning it has rolled out to most Chrome users. This has been a long time coming, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/google-starts-the-ga-rollout-of-its-privacy-sandbox-apis-to-all-chrome-users/">the APIs</a> rolling out about a month ago and a million incremental steps in the beta and dev builds, but now the deed is finally done.</p>

<p>Users should see a pop-up when they start up Chrome soon, informing them that an &#34;ad privacy&#34; feature has been rolled out to them and enabled. The new pop-up has been hitting users all week. As you can see in the pop-up, all of Google&#39;s documentation about this feature feels like it was written on opposite day, with Google calling the browser-based advertising platform &#34;a significant step on the path towards a fundamentally more private web.&#34;</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The argument here is that someday—not now, but someday—Google promises to turn off third-party tracking cookies in Chrome, and the new ad platform, which has some limitations, is better than the free-for-all that is third-party cookies. The thing is, third-party cookies mostly only affect Chrome users. Apple and Firefox have both been blocking third-party cookies for years and won&#39;t be implementing Google&#39;s new advertising system—it&#39;s only the Chromium browsers that still allow them.
</p><p>That&#39;s actually what started this whole process: Apple dealt a giant blow to Google&#39;s core revenue stream when it blocked third-party cookies in Safari in 2020. While it was a win for privacy, Google&#39;s not following suit until it can secure its advertising business. The Federated Learning of Cohorts and now the Topics API are part of a plan to pitch an &#34;alternative&#34; tracking platform, and Google argues that there <em>has</em> to be a tracking alternative—you can&#39;t just not be spied on. The Electronic Frontier Foundation also argued this when it called Google&#39;s FLoC a &#34;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">terrible idea</a>,&#34; saying &#34;[Google&#39;s] framing is based on a false premise that we have to choose between &#39;old tracking&#39; and &#39;new tracking.&#39; It’s not either-or. Instead of re-inventing the tracking wheel, we should imagine a better world without the myriad problems of targeted ads.&#34;</p>
<p>Chrome has some controls for this built into the browser now. Just go to the Chrome Settings, then &#34;Privacy and Security,&#34; then &#34;Ad privacy&#34; (alternatively, paste &#34;chrome://settings/adPrivacy&#34; into the address bar). From there, you can click through to each of the <em>three</em> individual pages and turn off the top checkbox, and in a mere six clicks, you can presumably turn off the ad platform. If you leave it on for a while, you can check out the &#34;Ad topics&#34; page, where Google will show you what ads Chrome things you would like to see. This list gets sent to advertisers when you visit a page.</p>
<p>Google says it will block third-party cookies in the second half of 2024—presumably after it makes sure the &#34;Privacy Sandbox&#34; will allow it to keep its profits up. Did any user in the world want a user tracking and ad platform baked directly into their browser? Probably not, but this is Google, and they control Chrome, and this probably still won&#39;t make people switch to Firefox.</p>
