<p>I was just over a month into my first job in the tech industry - a lowly HTML jockey and frontline support drone at a local web agency.</p>
<p>Everything that could have gone wrong this particular morning, had. I&#39;d woken up late, made a mess of my breakfast, there was a deadline to meet, and I hadn&#39;t even had a chance to grab my customary morning cup of coffee from the cafe next door on the way to the office.</p>
<p>Now our Intranet was telling me my password had expired.</p>
<p>Apparently, someone forgot to tell me that we needed to change them monthly, lest we get locked out of the system. Our home-brew Intranet software didn&#39;t have advanced features like password recovery.</p>
<p>I loaded up Skype and pinged our sysadmin for help. He helpfully told me that although I was locked out of the portal, my SSH key was still good for logging in to the database server and my user account had write access to the intranet database.</p>
<p>All I had to do was change my password to something simple I could use to log in, then use the web UI to set something secure and save it to my password manager.</p>
<p>In my un-caffeinated and grumpy state, I banged out this work of art:</p>
<pre><code>mysql&gt; UPDATE TABLE users SET password = md5(&#39;balls&#39;);
Query OK, 38 rows affected (0.02 sec)</code></pre>
<p>Shit. I had just changed the <em>entire company&#39;s</em> intranet password.</p>
<p>I checked my watch. 8:53 AM. I had mere minutes before everyone got to work and started trying to log in.</p>
<p>I got straight back on Skype and asked our sysadmin if we took nightly backups. He asked me why I wanted to know.</p>
<p>I sent a screenshot of my shameful performance.</p>
<p>After a good laugh and some gentle ribbing he restored the users table to its former state. I immediately got up from my desk, got a cup of coffee and went for a walk to clear my head before I could do any further damage. Upon returning I fixed my broken query and got on with my day.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, this indiscretion has never been spoken of until now.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned.</h2>
<p>Mistakes happen, especially early in your career. I was able to get this fixed before it blew up because I communicated my mistake promptly and got the right person involved in fixing it.</p>
<p>All of your colleagues have done something dumb. Don&#39;t be afraid to tell us when you make a mistake. We all remember our first screw up and will be happy to help.</p>
<p>Aside from that general life lesson, I walked away with these rules that I&#39;ve followed in every subsequent role:</p>
<ol><li>Make friends with your sysadmin, and stay in their good books at all costs,</li><li>Don&#39;t operate in production without coffee - or tea if that&#39;s your jam,</li><li>Don&#39;t run updates directly in the database console, and</li><li>If you insist on living dangerously (because really, this kind of thing is way too common in smaller organizations,) always <code>BEGIN TRANSACTION</code> first.</li></ol>
