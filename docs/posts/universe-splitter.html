					<p><span>Tough decision? </span><span>There&#39;s no need to choose</span><span><em><span> â€” <br/></span></em></span><em><span>Split the universe and do both!</span></em></p>
					<p><span><strong><span>S</span></strong></span><span><strong><span>cientists say</span></strong><span> that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. You can now harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone or iPod Touch!</span></span></p>

					<p><strong><span>Universe Splitter</span></strong><span>© will immediately contact </span><span>a</span><span> laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, and connect to a </span><span><a href="http://www.idquantique.com/products/quantis.htm"><span>Quantis brand quantum device</span></a><span>, which releases single photons into a partially-silvered mirror. </span></span><span><span>Each photon will simultaneously bounce off the mirror and pass through it â€” </span><em><span>but in separate universes.*</span></em></span></p>
					<p><span>Within seconds, </span><strong><span>Universe Splitter</span></strong><span>© </span><span>will receive the experiment&#39;s result and tell</span><span> you which of the two universes you&#39;re in, and therefore which action to take. Think of it â€” two </span><span>entire</span><span> universes, </span><span>complete with every last planet and galaxy</span><span>, and in one, a version of you</span><span> </span><span>who took the new job, and in the other, a version of you who didn&#39;t!*</span></p>
