  <p>A Leptos calculator project, breaking and fixing my router, cool fonts, and other things I got up to this week.</p>
<h2>Leptos</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/crystalsolenoid/leptos-calc-test/blob/main/src/main.rs">I wrote a calculator in Leptos</a> to get a better feel for the framework. I&#39;ve written something similar for work in vanilla JavaScript, so I thought it would be a good simple project to compare with.</p>
<p>It (of course) felt harder because I am not used to Leptos yet. I managed to get something very similar working, though!</p>
<p>It was difficult to figure out how to get the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> box to dynamically update if the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> box had a high enough value, but it kind of Just Worked when I called <code>set()</code> on the signal from a the <code>on:input</code> function of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> box.</p>
<p>The only thing I couldn&#39;t figure out how to do is how to set the focus on a specific element upon hitting the Clear button. This feature was simple to implement in vanilla JavaScript. I know how to set a property or call a method on an element using the <code>web_sys</code> crate, but I have a feeling that Leptos would make it easier than having to query the DOM when the element I&#39;m talking about is right there in the code?</p>

<h3>Tailscale trouble</h3>
<p>Tailscale has been acting up for me lately on Android, which is really spoiling my fun. It&#39;s supposed to let through all non-Tailscale traffic (since it&#39;s based on Wireguard), but recently it&#39;s been causing my phone&#39;s entire internet access to just not work. Maybe it has to do with DNS, but when I turned off &#34;Use Tailscale DNS&#34; it didn&#39;t help at all. Tailscale did recently do an update, so I kind of think that did something.</p>
<p>I was able to restore internet access to my phone by checking off every single app and service (besides my SSH app) in the &#34;App split tunneling&#34; section. There is no way to select all. When I want to do web development on my phone now, I have to go in there and uncheck my browser. I tried installing a second browser (Firefox) to only use with Tailscale so that I didn&#39;t have to do that each time. Strangely, when I have either browser unchecked, the <em>other</em> one <em>also</em> stops having connectivity.</p>
<p>It keeps giving me little warning messages like &#34;we can&#39;t connect to Tailscale so your tables might be out of date&#34; or &#34;DNS is unreachable&#34; with no apparent way to read more. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#39;t. When it does work, it&#39;s often spotty or I&#39;ll have to turn Tailscale off and on again.</p>
<p>I see a lot of closed issues that look very similar in symptoms to mine with short messages like &#34;fixed&#34; (no explanation), so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a regression or just some really common failure mode, but I don&#39;t have much of a way of knowing where to troubleshoot. The debugging messages they have people gather to report are cryptic, and I really prefer to understand what I&#39;m sending people.</p>
<p>Well. Sometimes that&#39;s the price of magic! So I&#39;m feeling really motivated to figure out Wireguard to access my LAN recently.</p>
<h3>Wireguard inter-LAN test</h3>
<p>I installed and configured Wireguard on my laptop using a combination of the <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/">Wireguard quickstart</a>, the <a href="https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/wireguard-vpn/troubleshooting/index.html">Ubuntu server documentation</a>, and <a href="https://tech.serhatteker.com/post/2021-01/how-to-set-up-wireguard-client-on-ubuntu-desktop/">someone&#39;s blog post</a> (which was helpful in showing me that the casual-friendly <code>wg-quick</code> command exists, ironically absent in the official quickstart). I feel a lot more confident about the configuration now, but I couldn&#39;t get a handshake with the router. I am equipped to test and troubleshoot now, when before I was just trying to connect through my phone.</p>
<h3>Breaking (and fixing) OpenWRT</h3>
<p>I realized that I hadn&#39;t used the same port for the Wireguard interface on the router and the port forwarding rule. After I... fixed? that, my router started struggling. The Wifi wouldn&#39;t respond, and I couldn&#39;t access the router over the web interface or SSH (even via Ethernet).</p>
<p>OpenWRT has a <a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/troubleshooting/failsafe_and_factory_reset">failsafe mode</a> that you can boot into, but it turns off DHCP. To connect, you have to tell your network card to have a static IP address. That was stressful to figure out how to under pressure, especially when I wasn&#39;t even sure the connection would work when I did get it right!</p>
<p>Once I did get in, I was able to back up my config. I zipped up the relevant config files as explained in this <a href="https://fabianlee.org/2018/10/10/openwrt-archive-router-configs-for-backup/">backing up OpenWRT guide</a>, but I had to change a couple things:</p>
<ul>
<li>After logging in for the first time to failsafe mode, it seems that you can&#39;t log in again without a password. Enter didn&#39;t work, and I didn&#39;t know the password if there even was one. This made it hard to zip up the files and then use <code>scp</code>. I was able to set a temporary password with <code>passwd</code>.</li>
<li>That guide suggests doing the <code>scp</code> command from the router, which I couldn&#39;t get to work. I think my computer was silently rejecting the request, because it timed out. Not even temporarily opening my firewall worked. Trying to run <code>scp</code> from my computer gave some error, and through <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/t/ash-usr-libexec-sftp-server-not-found-when-using-scp/125772">an OpenWrt forum post about the same <code>scp</code> error</a> I discovered it was because my version of <code>scp</code> was trying to use <code>sftp</code> under the hood, which the router doesn&#39;t support. A <code>-O</code> flag on the command fixed the issue.</li>
<li>I also want to remind anyone reading this that the resulting backed-up config files contain secrets including Wifi passwords and Wireguard private keys, and they need to be stored accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>After backing up, I did a soft factory reset and restored my config files one-by-one. Nothing broke. After installing the Wireguard backage and rebooting to enable it, the problem came back. I was able to delete the Wireguard interface from my config file in failsafe mode and then everything was fine again. I&#39;m going to try again, very cautiously, using the
<a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/vpn/wireguard/server">official OpenWrt Wireguard documentation</a> (which I hadn&#39;t used before because it doesn&#39;t use the web UI).</p>
<h2>Icecube</h2>
<p>We generalized our bitmap font code to allow another font option. Now we have a font trait, to be used for other font formats later. We aren&#39;t entirely sure how to best store the different kinds of fonts. For some reason I don&#39;t remember, it wouldn&#39;t let us put it in a <code>Box</code>.</p>
<p>The default fonts should get to be <code>const</code>, but <code>image::load_from_memory</code> wasn&#39;t letting us do that, despite the memory in question being loaded in with <code>include_bytes!</code>. Not sure if there&#39;s some fundamental reason, or if it&#39;s just because that crate hasn&#39;t made their functions <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll need to decide which fonts to package with Icecube. Here are some fonts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://not-jam.itch.io/not-jam-font-pack">Not Jam Font Pack</a> (CC0, TTF)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sunaku/tamzen-font">Tamzen Font</a> (<a href="https://github.com/sunaku/tamzen-font?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme">modify and distribute permitted</a>, multiple formats)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/raymond-w-ko/creep2">Creep2</a> (MIT, multiple formats)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/the-moonwitch/Cozette?tab=readme-ov-file">Cozette</a> (MIT, multiple formats)</li>

<h2>Browsers</h2>
<p>I built Ladybird. It took a long time, but was surprisingly straightforward. They have a script.</p>
<p>Through their docs, I learned about <a href="https://wpt.fyi">wpt.fyi</a>, which is a project that runs all the tests on all the browsers. You can look for failing tests and run them. What a weird, big world browser development must be.</p>
<p>Since it&#39;s so easy to identify so many bugs, I thought it might be fun to try contributing. But upon reading their code of conduct, I decided I didn&#39;t want to invest a lot of energy into the project. There are so many explicitly welcoming projects that don&#39;t leave me wondering out there that I&#39;d rather focus on.</p>
<p>I was disappointed, but then my friend and coding buddy John told me about a modular browser engine project called <a href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a>. It seems like it could be a lot nicer. As an added bonus, it&#39;s in Rust, so it would be more fun to mess around with, too! I&#39;ll try building it soon.</p>
<h2>Discoveries</h2>
<p>Some podcasts I enjoyed this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rustacean-station.org/episode/jonathan-kelley/">Rustacean Station: Dioxus with Jonathan Kelley</a> I thought the discussion on plugging into the Rust compiler to do hot patching was really cool. I was also excited to hear a cross-platform rust framework putting energy into playing nice with accessibility tools.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.changetechnically.fyi/2396236/episodes/17378968-you-deserve-better-brain-research">Change, Technically: You deserve better brain research</a> This was about a paper people were sharing online about <em>your brain on AI</em>. I try not to let the AI hype machine occupy too much space in my brain so I hadn&#39;t payed much attention to it, but I guess it wasn&#39;t a very well-designed study! It&#39;s fun to listen to people talk about research. The podcast&#39;s backlog has some interesting topics about engineering and people&#39;s brains. I&#39;m looking forward to the one about math anxiety.</li>
<li><a href="https://se-radio.net/2025/06/se-radio-672-luca-palmieri-on-rust-in-production/">Software Engineering Radio: Luca Palmieri on Rust In Production</a> I had fun listening to this because I&#39;ve had to be thinking about similar issues when preparing to share Accordion Task with other people. I&#39;m always really excited to hear about books for how to do some software skill, but presented through Rust. I might take a look at it later, though it seems more relevant for when you have a backend, and my first web prototype for Accordion Task won&#39;t.</li>
