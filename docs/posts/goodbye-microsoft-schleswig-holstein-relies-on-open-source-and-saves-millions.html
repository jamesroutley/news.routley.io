    <h1>Goodbye, Microsoft: Schleswig-Holstein Relies on Open Source and Saves Millions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        

        <p>The state administration of Schleswig-Holstein is making a remarkable U-turn in its IT strategy and <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Schleswig-Holstein-treibt-flaechendeckenden-Einsatz-von-Open-Source-voran-10177595.html?from-en=1">consistently relying on open source</a>. After the migration from proprietary Microsoft software to free solutions <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Schleswig-Holsteins-E-Mail-Systeme-auf-Open-Source-umgestellt-10733720.html?from-en=1">was initially accompanied by problems and criticism</a>, Digitalization Minister Dirk Schrödter (CDU) can now report a significant success: According to his ministry, the state will save over 15 million euros in license costs for Windows, Microsoft Office &amp; Co. next year alone. It is expected to be similar in the following years.</p>

<p>In contrast, there would be one-time investments of nine million euros in 2026, <a href="https://www.kn-online.de/schleswig-holstein/open-source-statt-microsoft-schleswig-holstein-spart-millionen-G7SUXTH42BBE3FGJC7VQQU4LTA.html" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">explained the Ministry of Digitalization to the Kieler Nachrichten</a>. These would have to be made for the conversion of workplaces and the further development of solutions with free software in the next 12 months. Given the annual savings, this sum will pay for itself in less than a year. In the past, the state transferred millions to the US company Microsoft, primarily for the use of office software and other programs.</p>
<p>The department sees the departure from this &#34;vendor lock-in&#34; – the dependence on a single large provider – as a clear signal for greater independence and sustainable digitalization. The financial incentive now underscores that digital sovereignty can be not only a political buzzword but also an economic gain.</p>
<h3 id="nav_almost_80__0">Almost 80 percent of licenses canceled</h3>
<p>The numbers speak for themselves: outside the tax administration, almost 80 percent of workplaces in the state administration have already been switched to the open-source office software LibreOffice. Schrödter thus confirms a course that reduces technical and economic dependence on individual manufacturers. The consequence of the conversion was already evident recently, <a href="https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Schleswig-Holstein-Fast-80-Prozent-der-Microsoft-Lizenzen-gekuendigt-10960941.html?from-en=1">as Schrödter emphasized in an interview with c&#39;t</a>. Regarding the status of Microsoft license cancellations, he said: &#34;We are at almost 80, without the tax administration.&#34; For tax matters, the state finance ministers have &#34;given themselves a clear timetable for the switch.&#34; Recently, the Christian Democrat also emphasized, according to the Südtiroler Wirtschaftszeitung, that the state has entered a marathon, not just a sprint.</p>
<p>The remaining 20 percent of workplaces are currently still dependent on Microsoft programs such as Word or Excel, as there is a technical dependency on these programs in certain specialized applications. According to Schrödter, however, the successive conversion of these remaining computers is the stated goal.</p>
<h3 id="nav_opposition_sees__1">Opposition sees challenges</h3>
<p>Despite the savings and the almost completed migration in large parts of the administration, the opposition continues to criticize the quality of the conversion. SPD state parliament member Kianusch Stender pointed out to the Kieler Nachrichten: &#34;It may be that on paper 80 percent of workplaces have been converted. But far fewer than 80 percent of employees can now work with them properly.&#34; Errors in the migration are &#34;still present.&#34; The initial difficulties in introducing the open-source programs have apparently led to ongoing frustration among some employees in certain areas.</p>

<p>The Green state parliament member Jan Kürschner also admitted in an interview with heise online that such a comprehensive conversion would not go without friction. <a href="https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Interview-Wie-die-OSS-Umstellung-in-Schleswig-Holstein-laeuft-10629991.html?from-en=1">But he emphasized the long-term nature of the project</a> and the necessity of fundamentally rethinking administrative processes: &#34;With the change, there is an opportunity to truly rethink the administration and free ourselves from old burdens. That is the great added value.&#34; If only a one-to-one conversion is made, it might certainly &#34;stumble at one point or another.&#34; But those who truly optimize administrative processes will likely find in the end: &#34;Open source is the better way.&#34;</p>
<p>The challenge now is to resolve the initial migration problems and acceptance difficulties and to further develop the open-source solutions so that they fully meet the requirements of a modern state administration. The savings achieved give Schleswig-Holstein more financial leeway for this.</p>
