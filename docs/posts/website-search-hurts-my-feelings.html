    <h1>Website Search Hurts My Feelings</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>I wouldn&#39;t mind this <strong>huge</strong> ad so much if the pancake mix was made with lentil flour...on second thought, that doesn&#39;t sound good:</p>

<p>And if I complain about not being able to sort by price/quality (or weight), I assume some people will point out that choice adds complexity. But it&#39;s hard to understand what value this choice is adding:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-2.png" alt="facet with a single option"/>

<p>Since we&#39;re talking about facets, I&#39;m curious what category those other 632 products fall under:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-3.png" alt="category facets showing 16 total products despite having 648 results"/>

<p>At costco, a search for &#34;rice&#34; yields this amazing facet:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/costco-1.png" alt="Each facet contains all the products"/>

<p>Surprise, the search returned 25 results (seriously).</p>

<p>I&#39;m particularly intrigued by rice that isn&#39;t vegan, lactose free, or gluten free:</p>

<p>The sorting made me check wiki to see how much revenue they have ($242 billion):</p>

<p>There must be a term in information theory that describes what&#39;s going on here:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/redmart-1.png" alt="Search for &#39;alcohol&#39; returns non-alcohol results"/>

<p>You can&#39;t tell, but the 2nd result <em>is also</em> alcohol free (the first 10 results are). For any Singaporean thinking that Alibaba ruined Lazada who ruined Redmart: no.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone would be offended if I said e-commerce in the Philippines has a lot of catching up to do. But this first page search result is something else (yes, they sell a lot of other laundry detergent):</p>

<p>The inspiration for this post is that nintendo.com lets you filter for <code>2+</code> players, but that includes single system, local wireless and online. So there&#39;s no way to get a list of games that supports couch coop. Unless you want to check 1680 games that is:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/nintendo-1.png" alt="1680 2+ player games"/>

<p>Haha, J/K. The search won&#39;t return more than 1000 records.</p>

<p>And while we&#39;re talking about nintendo.com, if you goto Games &gt; Nintendo Switch Games:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/nintendo-2.png" alt="nintendo.com homepage top nav"/>

<p>You&#39;ll get 120 games and only 120 games. Of course the list of switch games isn&#39;t under Games &gt; Nintendo Switch Games that would be silly. But, for days I&#39;ve tried and failed to figure out what these 120 games have in common and why they get this special treatment. I can&#39;t sleep.</p>
