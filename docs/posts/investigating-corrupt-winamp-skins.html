    <h1>Investigating corrupt Winamp skins</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><time datetime="2024-07-24T06:36:00.000Z">Jul 24, 2024</time></p><p>In January of 2021 I was exploring the corpus of Skins I collected for the <a href="https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/winamp-skin-musuem/">Winamp Skin Museum</a> and found some that seemed corrupted, so I decided to explore them. Winamp skins are actually just zip files with a different file extension, so I tried extracting their files to see what I could find.</p><p>This ended up leading me down a series of wild rabbit holes where I found:</p><ul><li><p>Encrypted files which I was able to crack to discover their secrets</p></li><li><p>A gift a dad in Thailand had made for his two and a half year old son, but didn’t want published online</p></li><li><p>Somebody’s email password</p></li><li><p>A secret biography of Chet Baker</p></li><li><p>Cryptic backwards audio files</p></li><li><p>A file called <code>worm.exe</code> which held quite the surprise</p></li><li><p>A host of extremely random images and files</p></li><li><p>56 previously unknown Winamp skins hidden inside other Winamp skins!</p></li></ul><p>This all aligned perfectly with my love of <a href="https://jordaneldredge.com/tag/winamp/">Winamp</a>, my love of <a href="https://jordaneldredge.com/tag/found/">found items</a> and was enabled by storing all the data I have about these skins <a href="https://twitter.com/captbaritone/status/1535471373191028737">in an sqlite database</a> (as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31703874">discussed on Hacker News</a>).</p><p>Here’s the story:</p><hr/><p>The first corrupted file I looked at contained just a PDF advertising a rentable bowling pin mascot costume:</p><p><img src="https://jordaneldredge.com/notion-mirror/84ebb48c-616a-4f51-ae9a-991a4e0a7e9b/e94461bd-1f9c-4ef4-bbda-23acc32ef0df/EsErCPFVoAACjOn.jpeg" alt="" height="1534" width="1406"/></p><hr/><p>Another was called <code>bobs_car.wsz</code> and, as advertised, contained just this picture, which I have to assume is the titular “Bob’s car”.</p><p><img src="https://jordaneldredge.com/notion-mirror/84ebb48c-616a-4f51-ae9a-991a4e0a7e9b/02d049fc-ee84-42b7-95f1-52c4c434db63/bobs_car.jpg" alt="" height="273" width="384"/></p><hr/><p>But then things got interesting. I found one that was an encrypted zip archive.</p><p><a href="https://capt.dev/file/TCIZp9O6FQBS51QrxWj1d/resubmitted.2003_acura_rsx.wsz">resubmitted.2003_rsx.wsz</a></p><p>I took the opportunity to learn about tools for brute forcing passwords in zip files. Soon enough, I cracked it, and found its contents:</p><p><img src="https://jordaneldredge.com/notion-mirror/84ebb48c-616a-4f51-ae9a-991a4e0a7e9b/7371ccc8-08f3-4202-b955-39ba04f31394/Screen_Shot_2021-01-18_at_10.46.36_PM.png" alt="" height="1036" width="710"/></p><p>The password was &#34;honda”. No idea why it might have been encrypted.</p><hr/><p>Another one had been created by a dad in Thailand who made an Adobe Illustrator mock up illustration of a Winamp skin he had designed as a gift to his two and a half year old son. But he didn&#39;t know how to make it a skin, so he sent it to <a href="http://winamp.com/">winamp.com</a> (along with a text file letter) asking that it be made into a skin that he could use. The letter was very touching but he asked them not to share the skin, so I have not included it here.</p><hr/><p>I found another encrypted zip file. This time the password was not in my wordlist. After a bit of fiddling with the cracking tool’s config file, I was able to brute force it as well. The result was a valid Winamp skin!</p><p><img src="https://jordaneldredge.com/notion-mirror/84ebb48c-616a-4f51-ae9a-991a4e0a7e9b/4d300a93-0973-42bf-8eff-43d2b4b33d94/Screen_Shot_2021-01-19_at_4.12.13_PM.png" alt="" height="952" width="572"/></p><p>Password was &#34;nayane”.</p><p>I went ahead and uploaded the decrypted version <a href="https://jordaneldredge.com/a3ea435df7ab4f7fa106ed23644b0358/">here</a>.</p><hr/><p>This got me interested in other “sensitive” things that might be included in skins, so I started searching for things like “password” inside the files <em>inside</em> all the Winamp skins.</p><p>I found one with a file called <code>E-mail passwords.txt</code> which contained… their email address and email password. Not great operational security.</p><hr/><p><a href="https://skins.webamp.org/skin/bf47d3cee462143bb4549fee59f567b2/Marshall_Matters_Skin_2.wsz/">Another skin</a> contained a text file with hundreds of blank lines and then, at the very bottom, the text:</p><p>Inside the skin was a file <code>Suprise!.zip</code> which was itself encrypted, but the password didn’t work! Eventually I figured out that the password needed to be lower case. Inside were a bunch of <code>.avs</code> files:</p><p><img src="https://jordaneldredge.com/notion-mirror/84ebb48c-616a-4f51-ae9a-991a4e0a7e9b/5b5f915c-44b9-4c36-adf6-1d69ea615450/Screen_Shot_2021-01-20_at_11.45.00_AM.png" alt="" height="632" width="1278"/></p><hr/><p><a href="https://skins.webamp.org/skin/5447f1bdfd64ffa7b3abe051ad717bcb/Chet_Baker.wsz/">This skin</a> included a file named <code>secret.txt</code> which was just a biography of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Baker">Chet Baker</a>.</p><p><img src="https://jordaneldredge.com/notion-mirror/84ebb48c-616a-4f51-ae9a-991a4e0a7e9b/a1ef95d4-8330-453f-a3e4-1df46ef9249b/Screen_Shot_2021-01-20_at_11.48.43_AM.png" alt="" height="1786" width="1588"/></p><hr/><p>Some skins included mp3s inside them:</p><p><span><pre><p><code><span><span>sqlite&gt; SELECT skin_md5, file_name FROM archive_files WHERE file_name LIKE &#34;%.mp3&#34;;</span></span></code></p></pre></span></p><p>For example this bizarre five second <code>cool.mp3</code>.</p><hr/><p><a href="https://skins.webamp.org/skin/fb3b75ccbb49d5d08e54e4705d51bd56/Alien_Workshop_Sovergein_Sect.wsz/">This skin</a> included a file named <code>Sovergein Sect.wav</code>.</p><p>Upon listening it sounded like it was being played backwards, so I reversed the audio file:</p><div><p>Sovergein_Sect_mp3cut.net.mp3</p><a title="Download" href="https://capt.dev/file/HFNMgySWlK27_5Bceihx1/Sovergein_Sect_mp3cut.net.mp3" download=""><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M216 0h80c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v168h87.7c17.8 0 26.7 21.5 14.1 34.1L269.7 378.3c-7.5 7.5-19.8 7.5-27.3 0L90.1 226.1c-12.6-12.6-3.7-34.1 14.1-34.1H192V24c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24zm296 376v112c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24H24c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24V376c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24h146.7l49 49c20.1 20.1 52.5 20.1 72.6 0l49-49H488c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24zm-124 88c0-11-9-20-20-20s-20 9-20 20 9 20 20 20 20-9 20-20zm64 0c0-11-9-20-20-20s-20 9-20 20 9 20 20 20 20-9 20-20z"></path></svg></a></div><p>I think it’s someone saying the name of the skin and some other information?</p><hr/><p>Some days later I found a skin that contained just one file: <code>WORM.EXE</code> That sounds dangerous!</p><p>I fed it to Virus Total but it didn’t detect any issues.
