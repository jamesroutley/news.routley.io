    <h1>Experiment 12 — LLMs &amp;.Fun With Pipelines</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>I could use a day off to reflect on my practice with LLM, but it is just not happening right now so persevere and sort of phone it in. In phoning it in I am generating some interesting experiments.</p>

<p id="a329">create a gitlab-ci pipeline that does something creative with code</p>
</blockquote>



<p id="f711">I am obsessed with pipelines. It is a way to divide up code based on stage, development, testing, and deployment, and to apply certain guide rails and checks to each stage. I have a whole pipeline metaphysics that I will at some point discuss. The technological society — which is our current condition operates under pipeline metaphysics.</p>







<blockquote>
<p id="6f1f">Creating a creative GitLab CI/CD pipeline largely depends on your specific project and goals, but I can provide an example of a creative pipeline that performs code analysis, generates ASCII art from your code, and then deploys it to a static website. This is a fun and unique way to visualize your code.</p>



<p id="60db">1. First, make sure your repository has the following structure:</p>



<p id="ca0d">“`</p>



<p id="2358">2. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the project’s root directory:</p>



<p id="c344">“`yaml</p>



<p id="c7a6">variables:</p>



<p id="8283">generate_ascii_art:</p>



<p id="db1e">deploy_to_website:</p>



<p id="541e">This pipeline has two stages: `build` and `deploy`.</p>



<p id="7848">3. Create the `generate_ascii_art.sh` script in the `scripts/` directory:</p>



<p id="402d">“`bash</p>



<p id="27cc">code_file=$1</p>



<p id="929d">python3 -c “</p>



<p id="029b">This script uses the `art` library in Python to generate ASCII art from your code and saves it in `ascii_art.txt`.</p>



<p id="8008">4. Make sure you have the `art` library installed in your Python environment. You can install it with:</p>



<p id="eba5">“`bash</p>



<p id="ba3d">5. Create a simple HTML template in `public/index.html` to display the generated ASCII art:</p>



<p id="0147">“`html</p>



<p id="7dae">Now, when you push code changes to the `master` branch, GitLab CI/CD will automatically generate ASCII art from your code and deploy it to a static website. You can access the generated ASCII art by opening the website hosted in the `public` directory of your repository.</p>



<p id="78e1">This is just one example of a creative GitLab CI/CD pipeline. You can adapt and expand upon it based on your project’s needs and the creative ideas you want to implement.</p>

<p id="aaaa">This did not work out of the box — as is the case with most LLM work. But it 95% worked. And I fixed it mostly by asking follow up questions not editing the code myself. What is most impressive is that the LLM created a series of pieces, the pipeline code, the directory structure, and code run by the pipeline.</p>



<p id="152a">The ascii art does not generate. I suspect it has something to do with my python program that generates a Fibonacci sequence.But I am not going to debug that. Instead I am really amazed what did happen and then maybe in the future I’ll go back and revisit these early experiments.</p>
