<p>I was on a Delta flight the other day, and I was thinking about how they offer
free messaging from your smartphone.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexanderell.is/posts/wikipedia-over-whatsapp/delta.png" alt="Screenshot of Delta site that says &amp;ldquo;Connect to Delta Wi-Fi to book, change, orcheck the status of your flight on delta.com, all without purchasing a Wi-Fipass. You can also message for free from your smartphone via iMessage, FacebookMessenger or WhatsApp (limited to text and emojis, SMSunavailable).&amp;rdquo;"/></p>
<p>How do they limit the wifi? Maybe they have some basic filter that says “deny
everything except the urls for these 3 messaging apps”, which makes sense
conceptually.</p>

<p>What if we don’t want to pay for wifi and we still want to be able to browse the
web?</p>
<h2 id="tunneling-through-whatsapp">Tunneling through WhatsApp</h2>
<p>If the wifi is letting WhatsApp messages through, what if we used WhatsApp as a
vehicle for the information we really care about? Much like we encapsulate the
rest of our networking objects in higher-level objects, we could encapsulate
web pages inside of WhatsApp messages.</p>
<p>We could start with a simple case, like Wikipedia. It’s mostly text-based, so
there should be no issue with sending images (which are blocked in the free
messaging over wifi). What if we built a basic service that allowed users to
query Wikipedia pages and read them over WhatsApp?</p>
<p>Maybe it looks something like this, where a user sends a message to a WhatsApp
number. If we hook that number into a WhatsApp automated backend (probably via
Twilio), we can have that backend parse the message, query Wikipedia, and send
the response.</p>

<p>There are two main components to this Wikipedia Over WhatsApp, or <code>WoW</code> service:</p>
<ul>
<li>The parsing of the messages and making requests to Wikipedia</li>
<li>The WhatsApp interface for sending/receiving messages</li>
</ul>
