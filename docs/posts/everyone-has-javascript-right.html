<dl>
<dt>Your user requests your web app</dt>

<dt>Has the page loaded yet?</dt>
<dd>“All your users are non-JS while they&#39;re downloading your JS” — 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/207096228339658752">Jake Archibald</a></dd>

<dt>Did the HTTP request for the JavaScript succeed?</dt>
<dd>If they&#39;re on a train and their net connection goes away before your JavaScript loads, then there&#39;s no JavaScript.</dd>

<dt>Did the HTTP request for the JavaScript complete?</dt>
<dd>How many times have you had a mobile browser hang forever loading a page and then load it instantly when you refresh?</dd>

<dt>Does the corporate firewall block JavaScript?</dt>
<dd>Because loads of them still do.</dd>

<dt>Does their ISP or mobile operator interfere with downloaded JavaScript?</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/28/sky-broadband-blocks-jquery-web-critical-plugin">Sky accidentally block jQuery</a>, <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/2014/the-network-effect/">Comcast insert ads into your script</a>, and if you&#39;ve never experienced this before, drive to an airport and use their wifi.</dd>

<dt>Is the user a microbrowser, getting details to embed in another 
app?</dt>
<dd><a href="https://24ways.org/2019/microbrowsers-are-everywhere/">Microbrowsers 
are everywhere</a>, every time someone pastes your URL into a chat app 
or a social media tool and it shows a preview, and they aren&#39;t going to 
wait for your 2MB client app to boot up.</dd>

<dt>Have they switched off JavaScript?</dt>
<dd>People <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/">still do</a>.</dd>

<dt>Do they have Chrome&#39;s Data Saver mode turned on?</dt>
<dd>If they do, and they&#39;re on a 2G or otherwise slow connection, 
<a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4775088607985664">Chrome will 
disable all scripting</a>.</dd>

<dt>Do they have addons or plugins installed which inject 
script or alter the DOM in ways you didn&#39;t anticipate?</dt>
<dd>There are thousands of browser extensions. Are you sure none 
interfere with your JS?</dd>

<dt>Does their adblocker block a script you’re accidentally
dependent on?</dt>
<dd><a href="https://twitter.com/heydonworks/status/1454826804464734209">Many 
people use adblockers, which may blanket-block whole domains</a>.
If you have one script dependent on another and that other script gets
blocked, the remainder of your scripting may not start up.</dd>

<dt>Is the CDN up?</dt>
<dd>CDNs are good at staying up (that’s what being a CDN <em>is</em>) but <a href="http://www.cdnperf.com/">a minute downtime a month</a> will still hit users who browse in that minute.</dd>

<dt>Does their browser support the JavaScript you’ve written?</dt>
<dd>Check <a href="http://caniuse.com/">Can I Use</a> for browser usage figures.</dd>

<dt><p>Is all the above true?</p><p>Then yes, your JavaScript works.</p><p><strong>Probably.</strong></p></dt>
