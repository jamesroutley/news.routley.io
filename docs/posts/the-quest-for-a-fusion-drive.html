    <h1>The Quest for a Fusion Drive</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="100%"><tbody><tr><td> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#the-quest-for-a-fusion-drive">¶</a><strong id="the-quest-for-a-fusion-drive">The quest for a fusion drive</strong>. As evidenced by… roughly speaking… <a href="http://toughsf.blogspot.com/2019/10/the-expanses-epstein-drive.html" target="_blank">every sci-fi series</a>, fusion engines are the future of space propulsion. California startup <a href="https://www.helicityspace.com/" target="_blank">Helicity Space</a> is on a mission to develop such a drive today. Their approach is <em>basically</em> a <a href="https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2021/04/scalable-new-fusion-drive.html" target="_blank">deuterium-deuterium plasma thruster with a pulsed magneto-inertial fusion “afterburner”</a> that compresses confined plasmoids in a double-helical magnetic system (a “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plectoneme" target="_blank">plectoneme</a>”… kind of like a helical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-pinch" target="_blank">z-pinch</a>). While early versions of the Helicity Drive wouldn’t exceed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_criterion" target="_blank">Lawson criterion</a> (more energy out than in) and would require external (presumably solar) power, the energy added to the exhaust from fusion would increase the system’s exhaust velocity and ISP (giving somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 s isp, vs a maximum of ~400 for chemical rockets). The claim—which we’re somewhat skeptical of—is that this energy gain is easier to achieve than a sustained, contained, terrestrial fusion power system (recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAhLGRcA-IQ" target="_blank">presentation from their chief scientist</a>). The required techniques of helical plasma jets (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/aaba6f" target="_blank">paper</a>), magnetic reconnection heating (<a href="https://infuse.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Helicity-Space-LANL-Simulation-of-Plectoneme-Formation.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>), and peristaltic magnetic compression (<a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DPP22/Session/TP11.3" target="_blank">paper</a>) have been demonstrated in the lab at varying scales. Notably, their all-star science and strategy advisory board includes Pete Worden, Air Force General and later Director of NASA&#39;s Ames Research Center, and Alan Stern, PI of the New Horizons mission to Pluto—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKI73vadPCQ" target="_blank">here is Alan excitedly pitching the company</a> and a proposed mission which would reach the interstellar medium in about 10 years. While this may not be the company that ultimately builds a fusion engine (it could be competitor <a href="https://www.psatellite.com/" target="_blank">Princeton Satellite Systems</a>, a magnetic mirror approach like <a href="https://www.physics.wisc.edu/2022/07/14/physics-technology-shines-at-summerfest-tech/" target="_blank">Realta Fusion’s</a>, or something else), it does feel like humanity will build one eventually, and we’re glad engineers are seriously working on it today. They’ve raised about $5M based on aggressive timelines, so hopefully, we’ll know more soon.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></td></tr></tbody></div><div width="100%"><tbody><tr><td> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div> <a href="#jobs">¶</a><strong id="jobs">Jobs.</strong><ul><li>Planet is hiring a <a href="https://twitter.com/bradneuberg/status/1588028471237746690?s=61&amp;t=SocMQV5E0YHfvBpqeKVeYw" target="_blank">Remote Sensing Machine Learning Engineer</a> in a remote or Canadian role.</li><li>NASA is <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/job/682558400" target="_blank">hiring a human-centered design lead</a> in multiple US cities.</li></ul></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></td></tr></tbody></div><div width="100%"><tbody><tr><td> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><span>The Orbital Index is made possible through generous sponsorship by:</span></p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></td></tr></tbody></div><div width="100%"><tbody><tr><td> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><p> <a href="#rocket-lab-catch-attempt-ii">¶</a><strong id="rocket-lab-catch-attempt-ii">Rocket Lab Catch Attempt II. </strong>In a perhaps-fatefully named mission, Rocket Lab attempted to recover an Electron first-stage booster for the company&#39;s second time. “Catch Me if You Can” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVTwEn9GdsA" target="_blank">video</a>) delivered <a href="https://www.rymdstyrelsen.se/en/swedish-space-industry/swedish-satellites/mats/" target="_blank">Mesospheric Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy</a> (MATS), a Swedish research satellite, which will measure atmospheric waves in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere by imaging airglow from oxygen in the Earth’s limb. The satellite was remanifested from a Soyuz due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The primary payload delivery mission was successful, but the booster catch wasn’t even attempted. Booster telemetry cut out during reentry, precluding the booster-catching helicopter from entering the recovery zone according to Rocket Lab operating procedures. The previous attempt in April successfully nabbed the booster but had to quickly release it for safety reasons. It remains to be seen if Rocket Lab’s approach, envisioned as less complicated than a propulsive landing, will be successful and eventually become as pedestrian as a Falcon 9 landing—151 landings will do that to the best of us. Even if successful, Rocket Lab’s period of helicopter catches may be short-lived, as their Neutron successor to Electron will use a propulsive return to launch site (RTLS) recovery, much like the two
