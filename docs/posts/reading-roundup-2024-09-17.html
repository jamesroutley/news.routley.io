    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          <p>One of the ways I like to do development is to build something, click around <em>a ton</em>, make tweaks, click around more, more tweaks, more clicks, etc., until I finally consider it done.</p>
<p>The <em>clicking around a ton</em> is the important part. If it’s a page transition, that means going back and forth a ton. Click, back button. Click, right-click context menu, “Back”. Click, in-app navigation to go back (if there is one). Click, keyboard shortcut to go back. Over and over and over. You get the idea.</p>
<p>It’s kind of a QA tactic in a sense, just click around and try to break stuff. But I like to think of it as being more akin to woodworking. You have a plank of wood and you run it through the belt sander to get all the big, coarse stuff smoothed down. Then you pull out the hand sander, sand a spot, run your hand over it, feel for splinters, sand it some more, over and over until you’re satisfied with the result.</p>
<p>With software, the fact is that sometimes there are just <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/02/ui-states/">too many variables</a> to know and test and smooth out. So I click around, <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2023-03-08T1210">using the UI over and over</a>, until I finally cannot give myself any more splinters.</p>
<p>Just the other day, I was working on a list of radio options, pretty standard-fare stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> with an associated <code>&lt;input type=&#34;radio&#34;&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Put them on the same row, center align them with a gap between the control and the label.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an oldie who used to leverage floats in CSS, I’m still amazed when I can use flexbox to do this stuff — it’s so easy!</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>&#34;container&#34;</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>label</span> <span>for</span>=<span>&#34;control&#34;</span>&gt;</span>Foo<span>&lt;/<span>label</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>input</span> <span>id</span>=<span>&#34;control&#34;</span> <span>type</span>=<span>&#34;radio&#34;</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>style</span>&gt;</span><span>
    <span>.container</span> {
      <span>display</span>: flex;
      <span>flex-direction</span>: row;
      <span>align-items</span>: center;
      <span>gap</span>: .<span>5rem</span>;
    }
</span><span>&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As I was doin’ my thang — clicking around a bunch, trying to get some splinters — I realized there was a dead spot in the UI, a place between the radio and the label where clicking didn’t toggle the control like I expected.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2024/radios-flexbox-animated.gif" width="172" height="135" alt="Animated gif of some radio inputs where the space between the control and the label doesn’t select the radio grouping."/>

</p><p>“What the?” I thought. “I’ve got my <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> and associated <code>for</code> attribute, why isn’t this working?” Then I thought, “<code>gap</code> in my flex display must be the culprit!”</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2024/radios-flexbox.png" width="312" height="159" alt="Screenshot of Chrome developer tools where an item has a flex layout with a CSS gap in between a label and an input."/>

</p><p>Sure enough, it was. While flexbox had made it super easy to add some visual spacing between the control and its label, that spacing had become a dead zone of interaction even though it wasn’t my intention!</p>
<p>There’s probably a million different ways to solve this problem — because <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/css-is-in-fact-awesome/">CSS is awesome</a> — but I just removed the <code>gap</code> and added some padding to my label, then voilà!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2024/radios-non-flexbox-padding.png" width="95" height="29" alt="Screenshot Chrome developer tools with a label that has a left padding."/>

</p><p>Putting padding on the label, instead of the containing flexbox, made the whole thing clickable without a deadzone.</p>

</p><p>A bunch more clicking around and things were working as expected.</p>

</p><p>It’s a small thing, but lots of small splinters lead to an agonizing experience.</p>
<p>So my recipe is: sand it, feel the grain, get a splinter, sand again, and repeat until smooth.</p>
