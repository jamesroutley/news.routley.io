    <h1>Gopher: Underground Technology (2004)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p><span>Back in 1992,</span> when &#34;yahoo&#34; was something cowboys yelled and &#34;ebay&#34; was just pig Latin, the University of Minnesota developed a new way of looking at data on the Internet. Their protocol, called &#34;gopher&#34; after the UMN mascot, allowed archivists to present the mishmash of information in a standard format, and enabled readers to navigate documents on a world of servers using a simple visual interface.</p><p>For a while, it seemed as if gopher might open the Internet up to the nontechnical masses and usher in a new era of online communication. It very well might have, if the Web hadn&#39;t come along and done it instead.</p><p>Mention gopher to a newcomer to the Web and you might get a blank stare. Mention it to an old-timer and you&#39;re likely to see a nostalgic smile. But to a community of developers and enthusiasts, gopher is alive and kicking. And if they have their way, it will have a healthy future.</p><p>According to a <a data-offer-url="http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher.floodgap.com/1/world" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher.floodgap.com/1/world&#34;}" href="http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher.floodgap.com/1/world" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">list</a> on Floodgap.com, over 250 active gopher servers are currently online, serving documents ranging from lawyer jokes to the text of the Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill. Almost half these servers are affiliated with American colleges and universities, but servers are also located on every continent but Africa and Antarctica.</p><p>One such repository is <a data-offer-url="http://gopher.quux.org:70/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;http://gopher.quux.org:70/&#34;}" href="http://gopher.quux.org:70/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Quux.org</a> and is maintained by John Goerzen, a 24-year-old Kansas systems administrator and programmer. In addition to managing what is to his knowledge the largest actively maintained gopher server in existence, Goerzen is the developer of a gopher server called PyGopherd, and the maintainer of the original gopher code from the University of Minnesota.</p><p>Goerzen&#39;s work on gopher is strictly volunteer, and his main motivation is his own enjoyment.</p><p>&#34;Put most simply, gopher is fun,&#34; he explains. &#34;Any programmer with experience with network programming can write a pretty much full-featured gopher server or client in a couple of hours.&#34;</p><p>Another of his motivations is preserving the history of the Internet. &#34;A lot of gopher sites are disappearing – running on servers that have been forgotten by now – and I wanted to be able to prevent the content on them from disappearing forever,&#34; he said. &#34;I started Quux.org, my gopher site, with that in mind.&#34;</p><p>Goerzen is not just an archivist, though. He sees a future for gopher in applications such as data exchange.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m interested in using gopher as a protocol for dynamic information exchange in a way similar to XML-RPC and SOAP,&#34; he says.</p><p>He also sees gopher as an excellent alternative to PDA and smartphone Web browsers.</p><p>&#34;Consider this example: Port-a-Goph, a gopher client in development for Palm OS. Cameron Kaiser wrote this in his spare time and got it working quickly on his own Palm,&#34; he said. &#34;Contrast that with the state of Web browsing on handheld devices: Despite many years to improve them, I still regularly run across websites that simply do not render at all, or render so poorly that they are unusable.&#34;</p></div></div></div></div>
