    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, May 7, 2024</em></p><p>Just a quick note: I just made <a href="https://github.com/BrianHicks/elm-duet">elm-duet</a> public and released v0.1.0. If it sounded great to you based on <a href="https://bytes.zone/micro/thing-a-month-04-02/">my post from the other day</a> then you can now get it! (But if you remember that, it&#39;s also worth noting I improved those docs a lot!)</p><p><em>Hopefully</em> this represents a stable release, but we&#39;ll see what we see when other people get their hands on it. I&#39;m certainly planning to work on tinyping with this as the base, so I&#39;m sure there will be changes and an 0.2.0 down the road a ways.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span></article></div></div>
