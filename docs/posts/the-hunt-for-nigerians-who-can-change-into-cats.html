He could just as easily be arrested for blasphemy or lynched by an angry mob.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Of course juju works, he doesn&#39;t know what he is saying,&#34; said one trader who lingered with a scowl on his face.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In his pocket was a black amulet, a small leather pouch containing supposedly magic charms, that he said was for protection. However, he was not interested in publicly demonstrating its powers, not even for $6,000.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Belief in magic often coexists with Christianity and Islam. Clerics from both monotheistic religions often refer to aspects of traditional African religions as evil - something real, but which can be defeated by prayer and their own higher powers.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Many pastors have become rich and famous on claims of having supernatural powers that can overcome juju and evil curses, something which many imams also practise.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, no-one has taken up Mr Adewoyin&#39;s challenge at two of the venues in Ogun and Ibadan and he is not holding his breath for his next stop in Anambra state in the south-east.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>While he has been dismissed by some as an attention seeker, no-one can hide from the grisly images of the bodies found recently with missing limbs and empty eye sockets in a resurgence of the sinister money-making juju rituals.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Mr Adewoyin wants to debate with Nigeria&#39;s traditional leaders on their belief in the supernatural</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This killing of humans to use their body parts for magic purposes gripped Nigeria in the mid-90s and led to riots in the eastern city of Owerri after the kidnap and murder of an 11-year-old boy in 1996.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Now, with social media, hardly a day passes without reports of a missing person and pictures of mutilated corpses linked to juju.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There was widespread outrage last month after three men allegedly killed a 17-year-old girl in Ogun state to use her body parts in a ritual they believed would make them rich. They confessed to the killing after they were arrested by the police and have been charged in court.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The clay pot and red cloths they were caught with could have passed for a scene in a movie from Nollywood, Nigeria&#39;s film industry famous for depicting manifestations of juju, but this was real.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And they were young men - the oldest was 21, sparking the Twitter hashtag #At21, where users described what they were doing at that stage in life and bemoaning what they saw as societal pressures on young people to get rich quick.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>AFP</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Voodoo is an official religion in Nigeria&#39;s neighbour Benin</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The outrage over the girl&#39;s death made federal lawmakers debate juju in parliament and consider the &#34;declaration of a state of emergency on ritual killings in the country&#34;, with its depiction in Nollywood movies mentioned as a factor. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Nigeria&#39;s Information Minister Lai Mohammed has also chipped in, blaming Nigerian movies and social media for the spate of killings.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He wants the films censor board to engage film makers &#34;on the need to eschew money ritual content in their movies&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But film makers are not having it - they feel he has unduly picked on Nollywood in what is a national crisis.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The minister misfired, he cannot breach our fundamental rights to create,&#34; actor and producer Kanayo O Kanayo told the BBC.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He said the minister was neglecting what has become a societal issue and the inability of families, traditional and religious leaders, and politicians to ensure the moral upbringing of young people.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>While the debate rages about who is to blame for the killings, a much broader conversation is to be had about Nigeria&#39;s educational system that fails to persuade people that juju and the supernatural are not real, says Mr Adewoyin.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He is hoping that his rebellious tour can expose those he calls tricksters, claiming the supernatural powers of juju, and help put an end to the spate of ritual killings.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;For a reasonable human being to believe that a human with all his biological components can turn to yam or banana is illogical, and worrisome,&#34; he said.</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
