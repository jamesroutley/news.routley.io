    <h1>Jony Ive&#39;s OpenAI Device Barred from Using &#39;Io&#39; Name</h1>

<p>OpenAI countered that io&#39;s first product would not be a wearable device, and that Rugolo had voluntarily disclosed details about iyO while suggesting OpenAI acquire his company for $200 million. Despite this, a district court issued a temporary restraining order blocking OpenAI, Altman, Ive, and IO Products, Inc. from using the io mark in connection with products deemed sufficiently similar to iyO&#39;s planned AI-audio computer. OpenAI removed its io branding shortly after.</p>
<p>The Ninth Circuit affirmed the order earlier this week. The court agreed there was a likelihood of confusion between &#34;IO&#34; and &#34;iyO,&#34; that reverse confusion was a significant risk given OpenAI&#39;s size, and that iyO could face irreparable harm to its brand and fundraising. However, the ruling does not bar all uses of the io name, only marketing and selling hardware similar to iyO&#39;s.</p>
<p>The case now returns to the district court for a preliminary injunction hearing in April 2026, with the broader litigation expected to extend into 2027 and 2028. OpenAI&#39;s first hardware device is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/details-leak-jony-ive-openai-device/">launch next year</a>.</p>
