    <h1>PeerTube v7.1 Is Out</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We&#39;re excited to release version 7.1 of PeerTube, which continues to evolve graphically, but also to simplify your discoverability! Let&#39;s take a closer look.</p>
<h4>Redesign of ‘About’ pages</h4>
<p>Thanks to the work of <a href="https://www.lacooperativedesinternets.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">La Coopérative des Internets</a>, the &#34;About&#34; pages of the platforms have been redesigned to make them even clearer and easier to access, with information such as a description of the platform, the terms of use, some key figures, the main rules in clear sentences, etc. We&#39;ve had a lot of positive feedback and hope you like it too!</p>
