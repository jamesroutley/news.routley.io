Kubrick was initially helpful, sharing viewing prints of his films that were otherwise inaccessible.</p><p>But, after seeing a draft of the book, the film-maker changed his mind and blocked its publication. He complained that the book had “a summary of the good things about [each] movie followed by a summary of the bad points, which, in [Kubrick’s] view, always outweigh the good on account of the overly emphatic way in which such criticisms are presented.”</p><p>Tantivy had signed an agreement with Kubrick stating that it would not publish anything “until such time as its entire contents have been approved in writing by me [Kubrick]”.</p><figure id="af7e98a2-c68b-4ce2-a301-26d55923b3c5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98499bb6a917c4b20d2435363335aba295dcfc0a/0_1460_3348_2008/master/3348.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98499bb6a917c4b20d2435363335aba295dcfc0a/0_1460_3348_2008/master/3348.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98499bb6a917c4b20d2435363335aba295dcfc0a/0_1460_3348_2008/master/3348.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98499bb6a917c4b20d2435363335aba295dcfc0a/0_1460_3348_2008/master/3348.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98499bb6a917c4b20d2435363335aba295dcfc0a/0_1460_3348_2008/master/3348.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98499bb6a917c4b20d2435363335aba295dcfc0a/0_1460_3348_2008/master/3348.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Smiling Kubrick and Lyon sit next to each other holding scripts" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98499bb6a917c4b20d2435363335aba295dcfc0a/0_1460_3348_2008/master/3348.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="266.8936678614098" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Kubrick and the Lolita star Sue Lyon during shooting in 1962.</span> Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Hornick said: “I understood his legal agreement with the publisher entitled him to ensure the book was factually correct. I didn’t expect the whole book to be rejected.”</p><p>Kubrick’s lawyers were clear: “If … any attempt were to be made by yourself or any other publisher to publish the existing manuscript without his approval our Client will have no alternative but to accept our advice to take all steps as are open to him to prevent such publication and to seek redress for damages suffered.”</p><p>Kubrick estimated that the “unacceptable” criticisms amounted to a third of the 70,000-word manuscript. But he never specified what had caused such offence and Hornick was bewildered as he believed the criticisms were not that extensive.</p><p>They appeared primarily in a chapter on <em>Lolita</em>, a 1962 adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov’s controversial novel about a man who becomes obsessed by a 12-year-old girl.</p><p>In the book, Hornick wrote: “There are good things in <em>Lolita</em>. But in too many respects it squanders, impoverishes and conventionalises its source material, draining it of its complexity, nymphetry and eroticism.”</p><p>He said: “I found the film version largely a pointless betrayal of the original novel from which it was adapted. However, I expressed great admiration for most of his other films.” His book describes <em>2001</em> as “a magisterial achievement” and Kubrick’s 1957 first world war movie <em>Paths of Glory</em> as “a film of intoxicating visual sophistication”.</p><p>Kubrick never responded to his offer to revise substantial sections, “so long as the critical integrity of the book was not jeopardised”, Hornick had written to him. Instead, the film-maker collaborated closely with his friend, the film critic Alexander Walker, on a book titled <em>Stanley Kubrick Directs</em>, published in 1972. “Who could blame me for not wanting to prolong the agony, giving up on the whole sorry imbroglio, and getting on with my own creative life?” he said.</p><p>Asked if he was bitter that Kubrick’s lawyers blocked publication of his book, Hornick said: “Perhaps at the time, yes, and highly frustrated too, but not for long, as I was very busy with other projects.”</p><figure id="758326d7-5c13-4ec1-b88f-bbe7b8a34533" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0fc3faaba6c97b52ec1290d956ed0db07db517/0_700_2646_3305/master/2646.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0fc3faaba6c97b52ec1290d956ed0db07db517/0_700_2646_3305/master/2646.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0fc3faaba6c97b52ec1290d956ed0db07db517/0_700_2646_3305/master/2646.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0fc3faaba6c97b52ec1290d956ed0db07db517/0_700_2646_3305/master/2646.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0fc3faaba6c97b52ec1290d956ed0db07db517/0_700_2646_3305/master/2646.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0fc3faaba6c97b52ec1290d956ed0db07db517/0_700_2646_3305/master/2646.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0fc3faaba6c97b52ec1290d956ed0db07db517/0_700_2646_3305/master/2646.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0fc3faaba6c97b52ec1290d956ed0db07db517/0_700_2646_3305/master/2646.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0fc3faaba6c97b52ec1290d956ed0db07db517/0_700_2646_3305/master/2646.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0fc3faaba6c97b52ec1290d956ed0db07db517/0_700_2646_3305/master/2646.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Hornick holds a cup of tea with bookshelves in the background" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0fc3faaba6c97b52ec1290d956ed0db07db517/0_700_2646_3305/master/2646.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="555.8295540438397" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Neil Hornick said despite publication of his book being blocked he remained ‘bitten by the Kubrick bug’.</span> Photograph: Jonathan Cronin</figcaption></figure><p>Filippo Ulivieri, a leading Kubrick scholar, said: “It’s quite shocking to read the correspondence between Kubrick’s lawyers and Neil’s publisher … Kubrick wanted a book that praised his films and Neil’s book was not like that.

He didn’t just make edits – he erased the entire project. Now, almost 55 years after Neil Hornick completed it, readers can finally make their own judgments about the book Kubrick was so implacably determined to keep from public view.”</p><p>Hornick writes in his preface: “Given the sad fate of my book, I thought I’d finished with Kubrick. But, as I’m sure others before and after me have also discovered, one is never really finished with him. If you’ve once been bitten – or is the word “smitten”? – by the Kubrick bug, it kind of gets into your bloodstream and stays with you for life … I remain interested in him to this day.”</p><p><em>The Magic Eye: The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick</em> <em>by Neil Hornick is published on 30 April by </em><em><a href="https://www.thestickingplace.com/spb/" data-link-name="in body link">Sticking Place Books</a></em></p></div></div></div>
