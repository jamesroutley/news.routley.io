    <h1>Twitter is using its embedded JavaScript to hide tweets that have been deleted</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>With all the fuss about Twitter’s promised edit button, and how they might design it, we’re missing a disturbing development 
— Twitter is using its embedded javascript to edit other people‘s sites.
</p><p>When a site embeds a tweet like this:
</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">we are working on an edit button</p>— Twitter (@Twitter) <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1509951255388504066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 1, 2022</a></blockquote> 
<p> the code looks like this:
</p><pre>&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;we are working on an edit button&lt;/p&gt;
— Twitter (@Twitter) 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1509951255388504066&#34;&gt;
April 1, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>That <code>widgets.js</code> script looks for blockquotes with the <code>class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;</code> on, 
and replaces them with a Twitter-branded iframe to confirm that it is a real tweet (and to encourage you to click through to Twitter).
</p><p>Without the script it would look like this:
</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">we are working on an edit button</p>— Twitter (@Twitter) <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1509951255388504066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 1, 2022</a></blockquote> 
<p>Until recently, if the tweet or account had been deleted, then Twitter would leave the blockquote alone, so the embedded text would still show, but without Twitter’s validation.
</p><p>This was by design, so that the act of quoting would still work. As Ben Ward, who wrote the original code said:
</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/benward?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BenWard</a> what happens if you embed a tweet and the user deletes it? does it show up as blank &#34;linkrot&#34; on your site, then?</p>— Ariel Waldman (@arielwaldman) <a href="https://twitter.com/arielwaldman/status/144855414633271296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2011</a></blockquote>
<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/arielwaldman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@arielwaldman</a> The embed code is a &lt;blockquote&gt; containing the Tweet content. If it&#39;s deleted, or 1000 years in the future, the text remains.</p>— Ben (@benward) <a href="https://twitter.com/benward/status/144855762836013056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2011</a></blockquote> 
<p>And the API documentation still <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/embedded-tweets/faq">says this</a>:
<img src="http://www.kevinmarks.com/embed-api-delete.png"/>
</p><p>However, Twitter has broken this API contract. Here’s a tweet that I deleted:
</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In Soviet Russia, Twitter edits you.</p>— Kevin Marks (@kevinmarks) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/1511531902385197062">April 6, 2022</a></blockquote>
<p>Notice that it doesn’t show as a blockquote fallback, but as an empty white blob. Twitter is not confirming the tweet, but it is erasing my citation of it.
</p><p>Twitter has used its javascript to edit my webpage text. When I pointed this out to Twitter Engineering:
</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s an old example post of mine. Notice how the 2 deleted tweets are blank, making nonsense of the narrative: <a href="https://t.co/6exFMCeS0Y">https://t.co/6exFMCeS0Y</a></p>— Kevin Marks (@kevinmarks) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/1508754959591956481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2022</a></blockquote>
<p>The response was that this was “to better respect when people have chosen to delete their Tweets”:
</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Kevin! We&#39;re doing this to better respect when people have chosen to delete their Tweets. Very soon it&#39;ll have better messaging that explains why the content is no longer available :) my DMs are open if you&#39;d like to chat more about this</p>— Eleanor Harding (@tweetanor) <a href="https://twitter.com/tweetanor/status/1508876355873738752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2022</a></blockquote>
<p> This is tampering with the public record. Any news article that cited a tweet from the former president,  <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/13/17233422/donald-trump-james-comey-twitter-slime-ball">like this vox one</a>, will now have an incoherent hole in it:
<img src="http://www.kevinmarks.com/comeyhole.png"/>
</p><p>Rather than the cited text:
<img src="http://www.kevinmarks.com/comeyfallback.png"/>
</p><p>I don’t think Twitter should edit other people’s webpages to remove tweets that have subsequently been deleted. Do you?
