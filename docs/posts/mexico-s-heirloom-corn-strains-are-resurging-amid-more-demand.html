    <h1>Mexico&#39;s heirloom corn strains are resurging amid more demand</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In Brooklyn, Mexican chef Zack Wangeman and his wife, Diana, have been running their tortilla shop and restaurant, Sobre Masa, since 2021. Their dishes and corn masa, which they sell to other New York restaurants, are made with heirloom Mexican corn from small farms.</p><p>Wangeman, 31, believes tortillas made from that corn have gained a foothold because for many they evoke a “country flavor ... that taste of toasted corn” that is uniquely Mexican.</p><p>“When you use hybrid corn, genetically modified corn or whatever other option there is, it doesn’t give you that nostalgic flavor,” said Wangeman, who was born in the southern state of Oaxaca.</p><p>He was drawn to the corn by a chef friend who returned from a food fair raving about it. Wangeman got in touch with Tamoa, a company that since 2016 has promoted the heirloom corn grown by about 100 families in central and southern Mexico to foreign markets.</p><p>Across Mexico, about 60,000 tons of heirloom corn is produced annually. It’s a tiny fraction of the 23 million tons of white corn grown on an industrial scale to meet domestic demand for human consumption and the 16.5 million tons of yellow corn that Mexico imported last year — mostly from the U.S. — for industrial and animal feed use.</p><figure><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/rockcms/2023-07/230726-mexico-corn-mn-0942-e6171a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-07/230726-mexico-corn-mn-0942-e6171a.jpg 1x"/><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/rockcms/2023-07/230726-mexico-corn-mn-0942-e6171a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-07/230726-mexico-corn-mn-0942-e6171a.jpg 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-07/230726-mexico-corn-mn-0942-e6171a.jpg" alt="Heirloom corn" height="1798" width="2500"/></picture><figcaption><span>Heirloom corn accounts for 20 of the 50 acres on Jesus Vargas&#39; farm in the central state of Tlaxcala.

But Rafael Mier, director of the Mexican Corn Tortilla foundation, said it’s clear exports of heirloom corn are growing based on the increasing number of tortillerías and restaurants buying it, especially in the U.S.</p><p>In Las Vegas, chef Mariana Alvarado said she began getting native corn through Tamoa and Los Angeles-based Masienda for tortillas, tostadas, tamales and the masa she sells in markets and online about four years ago.</p><p>At the time, she said, maybe 20 chefs in the U.S. used native corn — she estimates that’s now doubled.</p><p>Little by little, Alvarado said, she built a client list of Latinos and fans of Mexican cuisine looking for “organic, clean, healthy food.” She doesn’t believe this is a passing fad — in fact, she expects the distinction between Mexican food that uses modified corn and more authentic fare made with heirloom strains to grow.</p><p>“Smelling them, trying them — they realized that the taste is totally different from the tortillas they were used to here in a supermarket,” Alvarado said of U.S. customers.</p><p>This year, Alvarado pointed out, <a href="https://www.eatyoli.com/" target="_blank">a Kansas City, Mo., tortilleria</a> that uses native Mexican corn won the Outstanding Bakery prize at the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/james-beard" target="_blank">James Beard</a> awards — the Oscars of the food world.</p><p>“We’re making noise as tortilla-makers here in the United States, bringing native corn,” Alvarado said.</p></div></div>
