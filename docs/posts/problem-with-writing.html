However, I found that it has one negative side effect for me.

Let me explain.

Usually writing is the last step of the following process:

<ul><li>Observe something - can be outside world or can be my feelings</li><li>Take time to think about it and reflect. Maybe even process things intellectually or emotionally.</li><li>Once everything is clear in my mind I‚Äôm ready to write it down.</li></ul>
After I write stuff I usually don‚Äôt think about the topic anymore. I <i>release </i>it, because it does‚Äôt interest me anymore.

And here is the issue. When I talk to people the best conversations are usually about personal experiences: personal stories, observations, reflections and thoughts. I like telling my stories and I like listening to the stories from other people.
However, once I told the story few times I lose interest in it. I don‚Äôt like retelling the same story multiple times even to different group of people. 2-3 times is usually enough. I‚Äôm not interested in telling the same story more than that, Because you see every time I tell the story - I receive it and I have emotions attached to it and I like to observe reactions and emotions of people who hear it. But after 3 times the story becomes boring. It‚Äôs like me watching the same film. It doesn‚Äôt have the same emotional intensity.

So that happens with live conversations. But writing has the same problem with me. Once I wrote about the topic I don‚Äôt really want to discuss it anymore.

It‚Äôs binned and dusted for me.

Which is a bit sad. I wonder if this will ever change.

But the good news is that life is fascinating. With every year I have more stories and more reflections and more observations. I have more things to share with people and I have more things that I need to learn from others.
