      <p>How does it work?</p>
      <p id="howitworks">There&#39;s no word set by default. Every time you guess, I look at all possible 5-letter words that would fit all your guesses, and choose the match pattern that results in the most possible words. The goal is to maximize the amount of guesses it takes to find the word.</p>
