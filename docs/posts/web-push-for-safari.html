								<p><span><span data-start="0.0">♪ ♪ </span></span><span><span data-start="9.0">Brady Eidson: Hello. My name is Brady Eidson. </span></span><span><span data-start="12.0">I&#39;m an engineer on the WebKit Architecture team. </span></span><span><span data-start="15.0">I am thrilled to introduce you to Web Push in Safari. </span></span><span><span data-start="19.0">Web Push lets you remotely send notifications </span></span><span><span data-start="21.0">to your web application&#39;s users. </span></span><span><span data-start="24.0">Here, a notification displays from webkit.org </span></span><span><span data-start="28.0">in the upper-right of the screen. </span></span><span><span data-start="30.0">Clicking the notification opens a WebKit blog post in a new window. </span></span><span><span data-start="34.0">Before I get into other details on how this works, </span></span><span><span data-start="38.0">I want to answer a few questions up front I know many of you will have.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="43.0">Web Push is supported in Mac Safari beginning with macOS Ventura. </span></span><span><span data-start="47.0">And Web Push will be coming to iOS and iPadOS next year.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="53.0">Apple&#39;s Safari Push Notifications have been an option </span></span><span><span data-start="56.0">for reaching Mac Safari users for quite a while. </span></span><span><span data-start="59.0">While it will continue to work, today I&#39;m happy to announce </span></span><span><span data-start="62.0">that we have added support for Web Push, </span></span><span><span data-start="64.0">and this really is Web Push! </span></span><span><span data-start="68.0">The same combination of various web standards </span></span><span><span data-start="71.0">as implemented in other browsers. </span></span><span><span data-start="73.0">We&#39;ll go over those standards more later, but… </span></span><span><span data-start="76.0">the most important takeaway </span></span><span><span data-start="78.0">is that if you&#39;ve coded your application to web standards, </span></span><span><span data-start="82.0">you won&#39;t need to make any changes for it to work in Safari. </span></span><span><span data-start="85.0">Of course, if you exclude Safari through browser detection, </span></span><span><span data-start="88.0">then you have some work ahead of you. </span></span><span><span data-start="90.0">Now would be a great time to switch from browser detection to feature detection, </span></span><span><span data-start="95.0">which has always been the best practice. </span></span><span><span data-start="97.0">We&#39;re using the same Apple Push Notification service </span></span><span><span data-start="100.0">that powers native push on all Macs and iOS devices, </span></span><span><span data-start="104.0">but no Apple Developer account is required to reach Safari users. </span></span><span><span data-start="108.0">We are using new end point URLs for Web Push, </span></span><span><span data-start="112.0">which brings up another thing you might be doing to unintentionally exclude Safari. </span></span><span><span data-start="117.0">If you tightly manage push end points on your server, </span></span><span><span data-start="120.0">make sure you allow URLs from any subdomain of push.apple.com. </span></span><span><span data-start="125.0">Moving beyond answers to those important questions, </span></span><span><span data-start="128.0">let&#39;s get into more detail. </span></span><span><span data-start="130.0">First, we&#39;ll look at the Web Push experience in Safari </span></span><span><span data-start="133.0">from a user&#39;s perspective. </span></span><span><span data-start="135.0">Then we&#39;ll cover the entire Web Push flow, from asking for permission </span></span><span><span data-start="139.0">to handling a click on an entry in Notification Center. </span></span><span><span data-start="143.0">Finally, we&#39;ll see what it takes to add Web Push to an existing web app. </span></span><span><span data-start="149.0">But first, the Mac Safari user experience. </span></span><span><span data-start="152.0">And I can think of no better way to cover that than with a demo. </span></span><span><span data-start="156.0">Here&#39;s Safari on macOS Ventura. </span></span><span><span data-start="159.0">I have webkit.org open in this browser tab. </span></span><span><span data-start="163.0">I need to keep up-to-date with the WebKit open source project, </span></span><span><span data-start="166.0">and Web Push is a great way to do that. </span></span><span><span data-start="169.0">webkit.org is not allowed to request permission to push </span></span><span><span data-start="173.0">without the user asking with a user gesture. </span></span><span><span data-start="176.0">So I&#39;ll click this bell-shaped button here to subscribe for notifications. </span></span><span><span data-start="181.0">What you see here is the system notifications prompt– </span></span><span><span data-start="184.0">the same one you&#39;d see for any other application. </span></span><span><span data-start="187.0">In this case, it&#39;s on behalf of webkit.org. </span></span><span><span data-start="191.0">I will click &#34;allow,&#34; and I&#39;m all set. </span></span><span><span data-start="195.0">webkit.org is giving me the option to be notified about new blog posts </span></span><span><span data-start="200.0">as well as new commits to the source code repository. </span></span><span><span data-start="203.0">I know being notified for every commit will distract me from important work, </span></span><span><span data-start="207.0">but I absolutely want to be notified about new blog posts. </span></span><span><span data-start="211.0">So I&#39;ll check that box now. </span></span><span><span data-start="213.0">Coincidentally, somebody must&#39;ve just published the WebKit blog post </span></span><span><span data-start="217.0">about Web Push. </span></span><span><span data-start="219.0">This notification looks just like any other </span></span><span><span data-start="221.0">and is attributed to webkit.org. </span></span><span><span data-start="224.0">I can click it to activate, </span></span><span><span data-start="227.0">and there is the blog post, open in Safari. </span></span><span><span data-start="230.0">Once a user has granted permissions to a website, </span></span><span><span data-start="233.0">they maintain control over that permission. </span></span><span><span data-start="236.0">As a macOS user, I&#39;m used to managing Notification preferences </span></span><span><span data-start="239.0">inside System Settings, and that&#39;s where I can go </span></span><span><span data-start="243.0">to configure webkit.org&#39;s notifications. </span></span><span><span data-start="247.0">The same rich configuration as I&#39;d find for any other app or service. </span></span><span><span data-start="252.0">As a Safari user, I&#39;m used to managing website settings </span></span><span><span data-start="256.0">from inside Safari preferences. </span></span><span><span data-start="258.0">I can also go there to turn webkit.org&#39;s permissions on or off. </span></span><span><span data-start="264.0">And that&#39;s how Web Push works for users in Mac Safari. </span></span><span><span data-start="268.0">Before we move on, I want to reiterate a few things covered in that demo. </span></span><span><span data-start="272.0">First, we don&#39;t want users to be spammed by subscription requests </span></span><span><span data-start="276.0">they haven&#39;t asked for. </span></span><span><span data-start="278.0">So a website may only request a push subscription </span></span><span><span data-start="281.0">in response to a mouse click or a keystroke. </span></span><span><span data-start="284.0">Once a website has permission to show notifications to the user, </span></span><span><span data-start="288.0">the user controls that permission. </span></span><span><span data-start="290.0">They can choose to manage it in Safari&#39;s preferences or System Settings. </span></span><span><span data-start="294.0">And the setting will stay in sync if they happen to manage it in both. </span></span><span><span data-start="298.0">Finally, if you provide notifications for different types of events, </span></span><span><span data-start="301.0">it is a best practice to provide fine-grained controls </span></span><span><span data-start="305.0">for notification types within your web app, </span></span><span><span data-start="307.0">just like other apps do. </span></span><span><span data-start="309.0">Now that you&#39;ve seen Web Push in action, </span></span><span><span data-start="311.0">let&#39;s dig in to what&#39;s happening at each step. </span></span><span><span data-start="314.0">Some of you are already intimately familiar with this. </span></span><span><span data-start="317.0">But for those of you new to Web Push, I&#39;ll go step by step, </span></span><span><span data-start="321.0">referring you to the relevant standards and documentation along the way. </span></span><span><span data-start="325.0">The first thing that happens is a user visits your website in a browser tab. </span></span><span><span data-start="330.0">Here&#39;s webkit.org open in Safari. </span></span><span><span data-start="333.0">Since it is open in a tab, it can install a Service Worker. </span></span><span><span data-start="337.0">A Service Worker is a unit of JavaScript that operates </span></span><span><span data-start="340.0">on behalf of an entire domain, separate from a currently open browser tab. </span></span><span><span data-start="345.0">Once the Service Worker script is installed, </span></span><span><span data-start="348.0">your web app is eligible to request a push subscription. </span></span><span><span data-start="352.0">As already mentioned, this request must be tied to a user gesture. </span></span><span><span data-start="356.0">webkit.org requests permission when clicking this bell-shaped button, </span></span><span><span data-start="361.0">which fulfills the user gesture requirement. </span></span><span><span data-start="364.0">When your site asks for a push subscription, </span></span><span><span data-start="367.0">the user sees this system prompt. </span></span><span><span data-start="369.0">Here is where they can make the final call </span></span><span><span data-start="371.0">on granting your website this powerful ability.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="375.0">It is possible the user might deny the request. </span></span><span><span data-start="378.0">Your JavaScript should be prepared to handle that. </span></span><span><span data-start="381.0">But assuming the user grants permission, </span></span><span><span data-start="383.0">your JavaScript gets back a PushSubscription object. </span></span><span><span data-start="386.0">This includes everything your server needs to send a push message </span></span><span><span data-start="390.0">to this user in this browser. </span></span><span><span data-start="392.0">Information like the exact URL end point to use. </span></span><span><span data-start="396.0">You send this PushSubscription payload back to your server </span></span><span><span data-start="399.0">in whatever manner works best for your web app. </span></span><span><span data-start="402.0">Many popular server packages have Web Push support to manage subscriptions, </span></span><span><span data-start="407.0">or you can roll your own. </span></span><span><span data-start="409.0">The same pertains to how and when to actually send a push message </span></span><span><span data-start="413.0">to the URL end points your server knows about. </span></span><span><span data-start="416.0">I can&#39;t tell you when to do so. That&#39;s up to you and your website. </span></span><span><span data-start="420.0">But once you&#39;ve decided to send that push message, </span></span><span><span data-start="423.0">I can help with what happens next. </span></span><span><span data-start="425.0">Remember how push requires an installed Service Worker? </span></span><span><span data-start="429.0">Once your server has sent a push message and Safari receives it, </span></span><span><span data-start="433.0">Safari wakes up your Service Worker and sends it a JavaScript push event. </span></span><span><span data-start="438.0">Showing a notification to the user in Notification Center </span></span><span><span data-start="441.0">is a requirement while handling the push event. </span></span><span><span data-start="445.0">Receiving the push event and displaying the notification happens </span></span><span><span data-start="449.0">if your website is currently open in a browser tab. </span></span><span><span data-start="452.0">It also happens if your website is not currently open in a browser tab. </span></span><span><span data-start="456.0">In the case of Safari on macOS Ventura, </span></span><span><span data-start="459.0">this happens even if Safari is not currently running. </span></span><span><span data-start="463.0">The final step: If your user clicks on that notification, </span></span><span><span data-start="467.0">a notificationclick event is sent to your Service Worker </span></span><span><span data-start="470.0">so it can respond appropriately. </span></span><span><span data-start="473.0">For example, by opening a new window </span></span><span><span data-start="475.0">to the URL associated with that notification. </span></span><span><span data-start="479.0">With that understanding of the Web Push flow under our belt, </span></span><span><span data-start="483.0">it&#39;s time to get into even more detail </span></span><span><span data-start="485.0">by actually adding Web Push support to an existing web app. </span></span><span><span data-start="489.0">Besides webkit.org, Browser Pets is the most </span></span><span><span data-start="493.0">mission critical internal tool for the Safari and WebKit teams. </span></span><span><span data-start="497.0">Keeping everyone in the department up-to-date on their favorite WebKittens </span></span><span><span data-start="500.0">and Pups on Safari has always been the mission statement of Browser Pets, </span></span><span><span data-start="504.0">and Web Push has made that easier than ever. </span></span><span><span data-start="507.0">Our internal BrowserPets domain already had a ServiceWorker script </span></span><span><span data-start="511.0">registered to speed up page loads and synchronize between multiple tabs. </span></span><span><span data-start="516.0">At a high level, a ServiceWorker script looks a lot like this. </span></span><span><span data-start="520.0">When an engineer visits the Browser Pets page in a tab, </span></span><span><span data-start="524.0">this JavaScript excerpt either determines if the Service Worker script </span></span><span><span data-start="527.0">has already been registered, or registers it if necessary. </span></span><span><span data-start="531.0">Notice we&#39;re practicing feature detection here, </span></span><span><span data-start="535.0">previously mentioned as a best practice. </span></span><span><span data-start="537.0">With the Service Worker prerequisite taken care of, </span></span><span><span data-start="541.0">we&#39;re ready to subscribe for push. </span></span><span><span data-start="543.0">Remember, you cannot request a push subscription </span></span><span><span data-start="547.0">without an explicit user gesture. </span></span><span><span data-start="550.0">Running this script in response to a button&#39;s onclick handler </span></span><span><span data-start="553.0">is one of many ways to satisfy that requirement. </span></span><span><span data-start="556.0">Once the user clicks that button, </span></span><span><span data-start="558.0">here&#39;s code to request a push subscription. </span></span><span><span data-start="562.0">I&#39;ll go into each of these points in more detail. </span></span><span><span data-start="564.0">First, we need to configure the request for a push subscription. </span></span><span><span data-start="569.0">An important bit for that is the public key our server uses </span></span><span><span data-start="572.0">to identify themselves to Apple&#39;s push servers. </span></span><span><span data-start="576.0">Here we use the standard technology called VAPID, the same as other browsers. </span></span><span><span data-start="581.0">I won&#39;t go over the sometimes complex details of VAPID here, </span></span><span><span data-start="585.0">but there are resources on the web to help you </span></span><span><span data-start="587.0">with the best solution for your server&#39;s setup. </span></span><span><span data-start="591.0">With the VAPID key set, we&#39;re ready to configure the subscription request. </span></span><span><span data-start="596.0">Notice we are explicitly stating </span></span><span><span data-start="599.0">that we promise to always make pushes user visible. </span></span><span><span data-start="603.0">While the standard for the JavaScript Push API </span></span><span><span data-start="606.0">optionally accommodates silent JavaScript runtime </span></span><span><span data-start="609.0">in response to a push, most browsers do not support that. </span></span><span><span data-start="613.0">Safari does not support that. </span></span><span><span data-start="616.0">And like most websites, Browser Pets does not need that. </span></span><span><span data-start="620.0">Then we request permission to push. </span></span><span><span data-start="623.0">This line of JavaScript results in the permission prompt </span></span><span><span data-start="626.0">for the user to either approve or reject. </span></span><span><span data-start="630.0">Assuming the user grants permission– </span></span><span><span data-start="632.0">which all Safari team members do for Browser Pets– </span></span><span><span data-start="634.0">this gives us a PushSubscription object </span></span><span><span data-start="637.0">with the details on how to reach this user in their browser. </span></span><span><span data-start="640.0">Things like the URL end point and the key used to encrypt </span></span><span><span data-start="644.0">the push message for transit. </span></span><span><span data-start="647.0">Finally, we need to send all of those details to our server. </span></span><span><span data-start="651.0">As mentioned before, the specifics of this will vary </span></span><span><span data-start="654.0">based on your exact application. </span></span><span><span data-start="657.0">Our BrowserPets server uses WordPress, which already has </span></span><span><span data-start="660.0">a few plugins to support standard Web Push. </span></span><span><span data-start="664.0">It&#39;s likely you&#39;ll find the same is true for your backend, </span></span><span><span data-start="667.0">and there are resources on the web to help find the right solution </span></span><span><span data-start="670.0">for just about any setup. </span></span><span><span data-start="672.0">Now we need to go back to our Service Worker JavaScript code. </span></span><span><span data-start="676.0">It will need to handle a few new events, starting with the push event. </span></span><span><span data-start="680.0">When a push message makes its way from the Browser Pets server to this browser, </span></span><span><span data-start="685.0">this Service Worker has a push event sent to it. </span></span><span><span data-start="688.0">That event contains a PushMessageData object </span></span><span><span data-start="692.0">which has multiple ways of accessing the data sent by your server. </span></span><span><span data-start="695.0">We use the JSON accessor here. </span></span><span><span data-start="699.0">Remember how when we subscribed for push, </span></span><span><span data-start="701.0">our JavaScript promised they would always be user visible? </span></span><span><span data-start="705.0">That means we must always show a platform native notification </span></span><span><span data-start="708.0">in response to each push. </span></span><span><span data-start="710.0">It is best to do this as early as possible in your push event handler. </span></span><span><span data-start="715.0">We&#39;re pulling everything we need out of that JSON blob </span></span><span><span data-start="717.0">to configure the notification, including setting up an action with a URL. </span></span><span><span data-start="722.0">That will come in handy in just a moment. </span></span><span><span data-start="725.0">After the notification is shown, we need to handle the user clicking on it. </span></span><span><span data-start="729.0">One more event for our Service Worker script to handle. </span></span><span><span data-start="733.0">In this notificationclick handler, BrowserPets will take the URL </span></span><span><span data-start="738.0">from the notification that was clicked to open a new window. </span></span><span><span data-start="741.0">Take note: This is a very common pattern. </span></span><span><span data-start="744.0">That&#39;s all the JavaScript we need to write to support Web Push. </span></span><span><span data-start="748.0">Of course, it&#39;s best to have some help while developing. </span></span><span><span data-start="751.0">As usual, that&#39;s where Web Inspector comes in. </span></span><span><span data-start="755.0">In addition to helping debug your website open in a browser tab, </span></span><span><span data-start="759.0">Web Inspector can also inspect Service Worker instances </span></span><span><span data-start="762.0">and set breakpoints on event handlers. </span></span><span><span data-start="765.0">All of this together will let you inspect and debug the JavaScript </span></span><span><span data-start="768.0">that subscribes for push as well as the service worker code </span></span><span><span data-start="772.0">that handles the push event and notification events. </span></span><span><span data-start="775.0">Additionally, the Apple Push Notification servers </span></span><span><span data-start="779.0">will give you human readable errors if something goes wrong </span></span><span><span data-start="781.0">when you attempt to publish a push message. </span></span><span><span data-start="784.0">Check out the links associated with this session for further documentation. </span></span><span><span data-start="788.0">I&#39;d also like to get into more detail on a few points that came up </span></span><span><span data-start="792.0">while writing that code, with direct regards </span></span><span><span data-start="794.0">to user privacy and power usage. </span></span><span><span data-start="797.0">Importantly–and this is not the first time I&#39;ve said this– </span></span><span><span data-start="800.0">subscribing for push requires a user gesture. </span></span><span><span data-start="804.0">As with other privileged features of the web platform, </span></span><span><span data-start="808.0">it&#39;s the right thing for user trust </span></span><span><span data-start="810.0">to require that the user actually asked to enable Web Push. </span></span><span><span data-start="814.0">As mentioned when I showed you the code on how to request a push subscription, </span></span><span><span data-start="819.0">you must promise that pushes will be user visible. </span></span><span><span data-start="822.0">Handling a push event is not an invitation for your JavaScript </span></span><span><span data-start="826.0">to get silent background runtime. </span></span><span><span data-start="828.0">Doing so would violate both a user&#39;s trust and a user&#39;s battery life. </span></span><span><span data-start="833.0">When handling a push event, you are in fact required </span></span><span><span data-start="836.0">to post a notification to Notification Center. </span></span><span><span data-start="839.0">Other browsers all have countermeasures against violating the promise </span></span><span><span data-start="843.0">to make pushes user visible, and so does Safari. </span></span><span><span data-start="847.0">In the beta build of macOS Ventura, after three push events </span></span><span><span data-start="851.0">where you fail to post a notification in a timely manner, </span></span><span><span data-start="854.0">your site&#39;s push subscription will be revoked. </span></span><span><span data-start="856.0">You will need to go through the permission workflow again. </span></span><span><span data-start="859.0">That&#39;s all. </span></span><span><span data-start="861.0">We&#39;re genuinely proud to support Web Push and excited that any site can use it, </span></span><span><span data-start="866.0">no Apple Developer account required. </span></span><span><span data-start="869.0">As long as you&#39;ve coded to the standards and use feature detection, </span></span><span><span data-start="873.0">so you don&#39;t unwittingly exclude Safari, your users will already get </span></span><span><span data-start="877.0">the benefit of Web Push in Safari 16 on macOS Ventura. </span></span><span><span data-start="881.0">As usual, we&#39;ve added tons of other new stuff to Safari and WebKit this year, </span></span><span><span data-start="885.0">and I hope you&#39;ll check out that session to learn more. </span></span><span><span data-start="888.0">Thank you for watching. </span></span><span><span data-start="890.0">I hope you have a great rest of WWDC 2022.</span></span></p>
