    <h1>LibNSFB â€“ Framebuffer (bitmap on screen) abstraction library, written in C</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">





<h2>What is LibNSFB?</h2>

<p>LibNSFB is a framebuffer abstraction library, written in C. It is currently in development for use with <a href="https://www.netsurf-browser.org/">NetSurf</a> and is intended to be suitable for use in other projects too.</p>

<p>The overall idea of the library is to provide a generic abstraction to a linear section of memory which corresponds to a visible array of pixel elements on a display device. Different colour depths are supported and the library provides routines for tasks such as drawing onto the framebuffer and rectangle copy operations.</p>

<p>LibNSFB currently supports the following as framebuffer providers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Linux framebuffer</li>
<li>X</li>
<li>SDL</li>
<li>VNC</li>
<li>ABLE framebuffer</li>
</ul>
