    <h1>Destructive Acts Serving Constructive Goals</h1>

<p>Let’s say that the urges of the <em>Play</em> process compete with those of other processes, like <em>Sleep</em>:</p>

<p>If <em>Sleep</em> wrests control, then perhaps a <em>Wrecker</em>-process urge, previously constrained and now freed from <em>Play</em>’s constraint, need only persist for one more kick to gain the satisfaction of a final crash:</p>

<p>This destructiveness may seem senseless, but it may serve to communicate frustration at the loss of a goal, and to serve constructive goals by leaving fewer problems to be solved – the kick may leave a mess “outside”, yet it may tidy the process orchestration.</p>
<p>It isn’t true that when <em>Sleep</em> starts, <em>Play</em> must quit and all its agents have to cease. A mind can “go to bed, yet still build towers in its head.”</p>
