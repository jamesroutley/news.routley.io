    <h1>Handwriting but not typewriting leads to widespread connectivity in brain</h1>

R. (Ruud) Van der Weel, Audrey L. H. Van der Meer</p><p><jats:p>As traditional handwriting is progressively being replaced by digital devices, it is essential to investigate the implications for the human brain. Brain electrical activity was recorded in 36 university students as they were handwriting visually presented words using a digital pen and typewriting the words on a keyboard. Connectivity analyses were performed on EEG data recorded with a 256-channel sensor array. When writing by hand, brain connectivity patterns were far more elaborate than when typewriting on a keyboard, as shown by widespread theta/alpha connectivity coherence patterns between network hubs and nodes in parietal and central brain regions. Existing literature indicates that connectivity patterns in these brain areas and at such frequencies are crucial for memory formation and for encoding new information and, therefore, are beneficial for learning. Our findings suggest that the spatiotemporal pattern from visual and proprioceptive information obtained through the precisely controlled hand movements when using a pen, contribute extensively to the brainâ€™s connectivity patterns that promote learning. We urge that children, from an early age, must be exposed to handwriting activities in school to establish the neuronal connectivity patterns that provide the brain with optimal conditions for learning. Although it is vital to maintain handwriting practice at school, it is also important to keep up with continuously developing technological advances. Therefore, both teachers and students should be aware of which practice has the best learning effect in what context, for example when taking lecture notes or when writing an essay.</jats:p></p><p><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" height="20" fill="currentColor"><path d="M11.105 4.561l-3.43 3.427-1.134-1.12 2.07-2.08h-4.8a2.4 2.4 0 0 0 0 4.8h.89v1.6h-.88a4 4 0 0 1 0-7.991h4.8L6.54 1.13 7.675 0l3.43 3.432v1.13zM16.62 24h-9.6l-.8-.8V10.412l.8-.8h9.6l.8.8V23.2l-.8.8zm-8.8-1.6h8V11.212h-8V22.4zm5.6-20.798h9.6l.8.8v12.786l-.8.8h-4v-1.6h3.2V3.2h-8v4.787h-1.6V2.401l.8-.8zm.8 11.186h-4.8v1.6h4.8v-1.6zm-4.8 3.2h4.8v1.6h-4.8v-1.6zm4.8 3.2h-4.8v1.6h4.8v-1.6zm1.6-14.4h4.8v1.6h-4.8v-1.6zm4.8 6.4h-1.6v1.6h1.6v-1.6zm-3.338-3.176v-.024h3.338v1.6h-1.762l-1.576-1.576z"></path></svg></span>:<span>61</span></p><p><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" height="20" fill="none"><path stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M5 13V5a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v13c0 1-.6 3-3 3m0 0H6c-1 0-3-.6-3-3v-2h12v2c0 2.4 2 3 3 3zM9 7h8m-8 4h4"></path></svg></span>:<span>Frontiers in Psychology</span></p><p><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="currentColor" stroke="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" height="20"><path d="M12 2C6.486 2 2 6.486 2 12s4.486 10 10 10 10-4.486 10-10S17.514 2 12 2zm0 18c-4.411 0-8-3.589-8-8s3.589-8 8-8 8 3.589 8 8-3.589 8-8 8z"></path><path d="M13 7h-2v5.414l3.293 3.293 1.414-1.414L13 11.586z"></path></svg></span>:<span><time>Jan 26, 2024</time></span></p></div></div></div>
