    <h1>Bringing Memory Safety to sudo and su</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><header><p>Josh Aas</p></header><article><p>Our Prossimo project has historically focused on creating safer software on network boundaries. Today however, we&#39;re announcing work on another critical boundary - permissions. We&#39;re pleased to announce that we&#39;re <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/sudo-su/">reimplementing the ubiquitous sudo and su utilities in Rust</a>.</p><p>Sudo was first developed in the 1980s. Over the decades, it has become an essential tool for performing changes while minimizing risk to an operating system. But because it&#39;s written in C, sudo has experienced many vulnerabilities related to memory safety issues.</p><p>When we&#39;re thinking about what software we want to invest in we think primarily about <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/about/#identifying-risk">four risk criteria</a>:</p><ol><li>Very widely used (nearly every server and/or client)</li><li>On a critical boundary</li><li>Performing a critical function</li><li>Written in languages that are not memory safe (e.g. C, C++, asm)</li></ol><p>Sudo fits this risk criteria squarely. It&#39;s important that we secure our most critical software, particularly from memory safety vulnerabilities. It&#39;s hard to imagine software that&#39;s much more critical than sudo and su.</p><p>This work is being done by a joint team from <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/">Ferrous Systems</a> and <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede Golf</a> with generous support from Amazon Web Services.
