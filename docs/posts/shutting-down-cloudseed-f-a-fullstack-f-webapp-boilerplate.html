<p>Here I&#39;ll share a bit about what it was, why I&#39;m shutting it down, and the future of CloudSeed - including how to get your hands on the code if you still want it.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-cloudseed-f">What was CloudSeed F#?</h2>
<p>CloudSeed F# was a fullstack project boilerplate. The idea was to provide a seed for any cloud-native webapp so you could get setup fast and start building your differentiating features.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hamy.xyz/blog/posts/20250116_cloudseed-falco_0.png" alt="CloudSeed F# System Design"/></p>
<p>It included things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>DB + Migrations</li>
<li>Containerization</li>
<li>E2E testing infra with containers</li>
</ul>
<p>And ran on some great technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>DBUp - For data migrations</li>
<li>Falco - For clean, functional API scaffolding</li>
<li>Falco.Markup - For composable SSR HTML (also the inspiration for <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-07_cinderblockhtml">CinderblockHtml</a>)</li>
<li>Postgres - <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2024-09_postgres-over-everything">Just use Postgres</a></li>
<li>And of course F#</li>
</ul>
<p>I built it as I was learning F# to speed up my time to ship and have used it in dozens of projects over the years.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-m-shutting-cloudseed-f-down">Why I&#39;m shutting CloudSeed F# down</h2>
<p>I&#39;m shutting it down because I&#39;m not personally using it much anymore and few people are buying it. I think both of these are interlinked as the less I use it, the less I write about it in my posts, and the less people end up buying it.</p>
<p>I still think <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2024-02_fsharp-is-fun">F# is a fun language</a> and CloudSeed F# is a great place to start an F# web app but <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-11_why-im-moving-blog-fsharp-to-csharp">I&#39;m personally moving away from the F# ecosystem</a>. As such I&#39;m not building many projects with F# so this boilerplate isn&#39;t as useful to me and won&#39;t be getting the updates / upgrades it would through regular usage.</p>
<p>So at this point it&#39;s not useful enough to me to keep it running and I also don&#39;t feel comfortable selling something I&#39;m not actively using - the bones are there but it will slowly fall out of date with best practices and library versions.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next-for-cloudseed">What&#39;s next for CloudSeed?</h2>
<p>So if you still want to get your hands on CloudSeed F# - you can! I&#39;m moving the full codebase into my <a href="https://github.com/HAMY-LABS/hamy-labs-code-examples/tree/main/fsharp/2026-02_cloudseed-fsharp">HAMY LABS Example Project</a> which is available to <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/haminions">HAMINIONS Members</a>. This will let you clone down the codebase and use it as you see fit. We&#39;ll waive the licensing so you can use it in whatever projects you want in perpetuity.</p>
<p>Just <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/haminions">join HAMINIONs</a>, get access to <a href="https://github.com/HAMY-LABS/hamy-labs-code-examples/tree/main/fsharp/2026-02_cloudseed-fsharp">the example repo</a>, and grab the code.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also not done building software, just moving away from the F# ecosystem. My latest obsession has been Rust after analyzing it as a potential candidate for <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-01_missing-programming-language">The Missing Programming Language</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty excited about it so naturally I put together a boilerplate to make shipping projects faster - <a href="https://cloudseedrust.com/">CloudSeed Rust</a>. If you liked CloudSeed F# and were at all interested in Rust, this is a great time to buy as we currently have an early access discount for perpetual access while I continue iterating and adding features.</p>
