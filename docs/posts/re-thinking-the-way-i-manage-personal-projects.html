    <h1>Re-thinking the way I manage personal projects</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
<p>I have been trying a new way to keeping track of projects, and I went down a fun rabbit hole before settling on an approach, that I thought would be fun to share.</p>
<h2 id="but-first-some-context">But first, some context</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been maintaining a <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/05/22/you-should-keep-a-developer-s-journal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developer journal</a> for the past few months. I create a note each day and write down things I learnt as I&#39;m working on them, or use it to break down and keep track of tasks when I&#39;m stuck. If I&#39;m working on multiple projects in the same day, they all go in the same daily note.</p>
<p>Recently, I came across the concept of <a href="https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interstitial journaling</a>, where you write stuff throughout the day, but with a timestamp before each message. It seemed like a good idea as it gives me a better sense of how my day went, and was easy to incorporate with my then writing app of choice, <a href="http://logseq.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logseq</a>.</p>
<p>While looking for Logseq plugins, I came across the following comment on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/logseq/comments/tdysnj/comment/k0skrb8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit thread</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is why I used personal IRC and Discord servers/channels for logging/journaling. Just start typing; all entries are automatically time-stamped, sorted, and cloud-backed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My mind was BLOWN. The idea of a chat platform as a means of logging personal projects made so much sense! I had basically been trying to recreate the feeling of chatting with myself, and I didn&#39;t realize it until I read this comment.</p>
<p>I had been coming across the idea of <a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-hosting</a> while looking for project ideas and saw IRC mentioned there, so I looked into it. <strong>That&#39;s where the idea clicked</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="channels-as-project-logs">Channels as project logs</h2>
<p>Trying out IRC felt like using something like Slack or Discord, but much more minimal. It is a text-based chat protocol based on the client-server model. There are servers that consist of one or more channels, and clients with which you can connect to and interact on channels by joining them.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://weechat.org/about/screenshots/weechat/weechat_2010-02-22_hullap.png/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interface</a> is also a minimal version of Slack or Discord, with a list of channels you&#39;ve joined on the left and time-stamped messages from a channel in the center.</p>
<p>Now how does this relate to project management, you ask?</p>
<ul>
<li>Each channel represents one project I&#39;m working on</li>
<li>When I want to log something specific to a project, I post a message in that channel</li>
</ul>
<p>This simple concept solves issues I&#39;ve faced with the existing dev journal setup.</p>
<p>When I revisit a project after a break (which I often do), that would require searching through older notes to figure out where I last left off. While the daily notes made things easier on a day-to-day basis, I often felt the lack of a overall view of a project.</p>
<p>A channel helps with both time-tracking and project management:</p>
<ul>
<li>The messages are time-stamped, so I know how my day went</li>
<li>The channel serves as the overall picture of my project - what I&#39;ve done, what I need to do and where I last left off. Everything relating to a project is in one place.</li>
<li>The channels list in the side tells me at a glance which projects I&#39;m working on, and lets me easily switch between them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This also helps in cases when I want to write a post about something I did over a long period of time - say weeks - and I forget details of what I did earlier.</p>
<p>A chat interface encourages me to write smaller updates, so I end up with a reliable log of events, as opposed to me having logged only certain aspects and trying to remember other details while writing the post (extremely annoying, trust me). And <a href="https://pjg1.site/writing-is-thinking">more writing leads to more thinking</a>, so I consider this approach a win!</p>
<p>So I have the idea set, now comes the rabbit hole I went into while trying to look for ways to implement this.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-perfect-implementation">Finding the perfect implementation</h2>
<h3 id="self-hosted-irc-server">Self-hosted IRC server</h3>
<p>Since the idea came from IRC, my first idea was to use the self-hosted server I used to try IRC in the first place. I had setup <a href="http://unrealircd.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UnrealIRCd</a> on my daily driver, and installed two IRC clients to try - <a href="https://www.codeux.com/textual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Textual</a> (a <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>) and <a href="http://irssi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">irssi</a> (a <abbr title="Text User Interface">TUI</abbr>).</p>
<p>It all worked fine, but I came across its limitations pretty quickly. It doesn&#39;t support multi-line messages and making the chat persist across sessions required additional setup, which didn&#39;t seem worth the effort.</p>
<h3 id="self-hosted-zulip-server">Self-hosted Zulip server</h3>
<p>A great open-source alternative to Slack/Discord is <a href="https://zulipchat.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zulip</a>, which is used as the primary chat platform at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=2ac66128b9116e0722d941ebf7e14b5a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recurse Center</a>. I&#39;m familiar with the interface and it has the concept of channels, which I can use to manage projects.</p>
<p>After some trial and error, I was able to self-host an instance using their <a href="https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docker image</a>. It worked well, but it also felt overkill for some reason. I realized I wanted something that didn&#39;t rely on the internet to function, but something that looked like a chat platform visually.</p>
<h3 id="custom-built-tui">Custom-built TUI</h3>
<p>I really like the <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bubbletea framework</a> for TUIs, and had it in my &#34;make something with this someday&#34; list. This seemed like a good chance, and I even found some projects as inspiration!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bashbunni/pjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pjs</a> follows the same concept of time-stamped project logging, but with a different implementation. It uses a SQLite DB to store notes, and each note is displayed separately as opposed to a chat interface.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/maaslalani/nap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nap</a> is a code snippet manager that reads and displays plaintext files, and the layout is pretty close to what I had in mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, my feelings about TUIs are mixed - I find them really cool but don&#39;t use them much for some reason. This made me hesitant from really giving the idea a fair chance. I feared I would spend all this effort making something, and lose interest while making it.</p>
<p>This would have made for a great programming project though. Maybe someday.</p>
<h3 id="existing-gui-apps">Existing GUI apps</h3>
<p>I didn&#39;t expect to find much here, but I ended up finding multiple apps.</p>
<p>The one app I ended up trying was <a href="http://strflow.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strflow</a>, a macOS app. It provides a chat-like interface, where you can type messages with a subset of Markdown and the option to add tags. Each tag then becomes its own view, so you either see all messages at once or filter by a specific tag. While I would have preferred separate chats for each project, filtering by tags seemed fair enough.</p>
<p>I tried Strflow for about a day, and it worked really well! It allowed me to import my existing notes (there&#39;s an option to select an earlier date) and had a floating window shortcut, which displays a tinier version of the chat interface. It didn&#39;t make me go &#34;this is it&#34; though.</p>
<p>Somewhere, I was still craving on making my own implementation, so I finally settled on an idea involving good &#39;ol plaintext files and Markdown.</p>
<h2 id="current-setup">Current setup</h2>
<p>I created a folder called <code>logs</code> which contains all of the project logs. Each project corresponds to one log file - <code>PROJNAME.md</code>, and follows this format:</p>
<pre><code>
#### 27 Sep 2024

##### 16:54
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

##### 20:55
Curabitur laoreet fermentum enim malesuada volutpat.

Praesent semper non odio at vestibulum.

...
</code></pre>
<p>I thought of choosing a shorter custom syntax, but if I ever want to export these logs as HTML, using existing syntax would make conversion and styling easier. I also don&#39;t use <code>h4</code> and <code>h5</code> tags in my writing, so using them here makes it easy to parse individual messages if I ever need to do that.</p>
<p>I added custom CSS set to my Markdown editor, <a href="https://typora.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typora</a>, to render the log files in a cool way. The above log file renders like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="sep-2024">27 Sep 2024</h4>
<h5 id="section">16:54</h5>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
<h5 id="section-1">20:55</h5>
<p>Curabitur laoreet fermentum enim malesuada volutpat.</p>
<p>Praesent semper non odio at vestibulum.</p>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there&#39;s the shell script to automate the logging process (parts of the script are omitted):</p>
<pre><code>file=&#34;$LOGDIR/$1.md&#34;
shift

if [[ -f &#34;$file&#34; ]]; then
        lastdate=&#34;$(grep &#39;^#### &#39; &#34;$file&#34; | tail -n1 | cut -c5- )&#34;
        todate=&#34;$(date &#39;+%b %d %Y&#39;)&#34;

        cat &lt;&lt;-EndOfMessage &gt;&gt; &#34;$file&#34;
                $(if [[ &#34;$lastdate&#34; != &#34;$todate&#34; ]]; then echo &#34;#### $todate&#34;; fi)
                ##### $(date &#39;+%H:%M&#39;)
                ${@:-$($EDITOR $(mktemp))}
                EndOfMessage
fi</code></pre>
<p>If the file exists, it extracts the last date in a file, and compares it with the current date. If the dates are different (for instance posting a note past midnight), it inserts the date, followed by the timestamp.</p>
<p>Line 11 is the content of the message. That cool bash syntax means &#34;take the remaining command line arguments if not empty, otherwise open a temporary file using an editor and take its contents after the editor is closed instead&#34;.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>The interactivity of a chat interface is still missing - having a chat box that appears with a shortcut, or being able to post multiple messages in succession instead of calling the shell script everytime.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also starting to get interest in the TUI idea again, now that I recently learnt that my terminal emulator can <a href="https://iterm2.com/documentation-hotkey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">display terminal windows with a shortcut</a>, and they can be <strong>floating windows</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also thinking of a web-based approach, with a frontend that resembles IRC/Slack.</p>
<p>Too many ideas in different directions, let&#39;s see where this goes.</p></div></div>
