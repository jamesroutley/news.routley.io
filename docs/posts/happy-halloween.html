<h4>What I Did</h4>



<ul>
<li>CS50 Web:
<ul>
<li>Worked on <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/projects/4/network/">CS50 Web Project 4: Network</a></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Worked on Python problems on Codewars</li>



<li>Read <em>Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview</em> (sections 4–5)</li>



<li>Created my first iOS app and integrated an SDK as part of job search activities, exploring Xcode along the way</li>
</ul>



<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Slowed down on CS50 Web the last few weeks (partly because of other things I was working on, partly because for about a week I was playing <em>Blue Prince</em> like it was my job), but getting back into it since I am aiming to complete the course by the end of the year.</li>
