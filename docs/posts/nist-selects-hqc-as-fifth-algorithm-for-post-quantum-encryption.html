      <p>Last year, NIST <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ddbc9e3c-f95a-4a40-b067-a33419550b97" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="NIST Releases First 3 Finalized Post-Quantum Encryption Standards ">standardized a set of encryption algorithms</a> that can keep data secure from a cyberattack by a future quantum computer. Now, NIST has <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/8545/final">selected a backup algorithm</a> that can provide a second line of defense for the task of general encryption, which safeguards internet traffic and stored data alike.</p><p>Encryption protects sensitive electronic information, including internet traffic and medical and financial records, as well as corporate and national security secrets. But a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, if one is ever built, would be able to break that defense. NIST has been working for more than eight years on encryption algorithms that even a quantum computer cannot break.</p><p>Last year, NIST <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final">published an encryption standard</a> based on a quantum-resistant algorithm called ML-KEM. The new algorithm, called HQC, will serve as a backup defense in case quantum computers are someday able to crack ML-KEM. Both these algorithms are designed to protect stored information as well as data that travels across public networks.</p><p>HQC is not intended to take the place of ML-KEM, which will remain the recommended choice for general encryption, said Dustin Moody, a mathematician who heads NIST’s Post-Quantum Cryptography project. </p><p>“Organizations should continue to migrate their encryption systems to the standards we finalized in 2024,” he said. “We are announcing the selection of HQC because we want to have a backup standard that is based on a different math approach than ML-KEM. As we advance our understanding of future quantum computers and adapt to emerging cryptanalysis techniques, it’s essential to have a fallback in case ML-KEM proves to be vulnerable.”</p><h2>Encryption Based on Two Math Problems</h2><p>Encryption systems rely on complex math problems that conventional computers find difficult or impossible to solve. A sufficiently capable quantum computer, though, would be able to sift through a vast number of potential solutions to these problems very quickly, thereby defeating current encryption.</p><p>While the ML-KEM algorithm is built around a mathematical idea called structured lattices, the HQC algorithm is built around another concept called <a href="https://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-errors6">error-correcting codes</a>, which have been used in information security for decades. Moody said that HQC is a lengthier algorithm than ML-KEM and therefore demands more computing resources. However its clean and secure operation convinced reviewers that it would make a worthy backup choice. </p><p><em>“Organizations should continue to migrate their encryption systems to the standards NIST finalized in 2024. We are announcing the selection of HQC because we want to have a backup standard that is based on a different math approach than ML-KEM.” —Dustin Moody, NIST mathematician and project head</em></p><h2>Present and Future Standards</h2><p>HQC is the latest algorithm chosen by NIST’s <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography">Post-Quantum Cryptography project</a>, which has overseen efforts since 2016 to head off potential threats from quantum computers. HQC will take its place alongside the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7bbcf712-b87a-4e7f-8656-61cd36e07e4d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="NIST Announces First Four Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Algorithms">four algorithms NIST selected previously</a>. Three of those algorithms have been <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ddbc9e3c-f95a-4a40-b067-a33419550b97" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="NIST Releases First 3 Finalized Post-Quantum Encryption Standards ">incorporated into finished standards</a>, including ML-KEM, which forms the core of the standard called FIPS 203. </p><p>The other two finished standards, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final">FIPS 204</a> and <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final">FIPS 205</a>, contain digital signature algorithms, a kind of “electronic fingerprint” that authenticates the identity of a sender, such as when remotely signing documents. The three finished standards are ready for use, and organizations have already started integrating them into their information systems to future-proof them.</p><p>A draft of the fourth standard, built around the FALCON algorithm, also concerns digital signatures and will be released shortly as FIPS 206. </p><p>HQC is the only algorithm to be standardized from NIST&#39;s <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-4-submissions">fourth round</a> of candidates, which initially included four algorithms meriting further study. NIST has <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/8545/final">released a report</a> summarizing each of these four candidate algorithms and detailing why HQC was selected.</p><p>NIST plans to release a draft standard built around HQC for public comment in about a year. Following a 90-day comment period, NIST will address the comments and finalize the standard for release in 2027.</p><div><h2>Draft Guidance for KEM Algorithms</h2><p>One thing HQC has in common with ML-KEM is that they are both what experts call “key encapsulation mechanisms,” or KEMs. A KEM is used over a public network as a sort of first handshake between two parties that want to exchange confidential information. </p><p>NIST has recently published draft guidance for implementing KEM algorithms. This guidance, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/227/ipd"><em>Recommendations for Key Encapsulation Mechanisms</em> (NIST Special Publication 800-227)</a>, describes the basic definitions, properties and applications of KEMs. It also provides recommendations for implementing and using KEMs in a secure manner. NIST hosted a virtual <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/events/2025/workshop-on-guidance-for-kems">Workshop on Guidance for KEMs</a> in February, and the draft was open for public comment until March 7, 2025.</p></div>
