<p><strong>September 12, 2025</strong></p>

<p>As a standards-interested person, I love catching up with the progress of people who are trying to improve other, seemingly-intractable problems in software.
One such guy is Andy, the creator of OILS (and fellow recurser!), a backwards-compatible shell that aims to be an upgrade path from Bash to… you know, something better than Bash.
I’ve learned a lot from his writing over the years, particularly about xargs.</p>
<p>Another related one is terminals.</p>
<h2 id="terminal-vim"><a href="#terminal-vim" aria-label="Anchor link for: terminal-vim">Terminal Vim</a></h2>
<p>Here’s a problem I’ve had for years:
I would like to save my Vim buffer with Cmd+S.</p>
<!-- I've been saving things with Cmd+S (Ctrl+S, when I was on Windows) for about as long as I've been using a computer. -->
<!-- It's as universal as keyboard shortcuts come. -->
<!-- It works in Sublime Text, VSCode, Microsoft Word, and Preview. -->
<!-- But it doesn't work in Vim. -->
<p>The default way to save a Vim files to type <code>:w</code> then hit enter in normal mode.
That’s fine, but it’s way too cumbersome for an action that I am going to do many, many times in a single editing session.</p>
<p>Vim supports keyboard shortcuts with modifier keys like this.
<code>&lt;C-s&gt;</code> would be Ctrl+S, <code>&lt;D-s&gt;</code> for Cmd+S and so on.
In theory, all I should have to do is add the following line to my <code>.vimrc</code> file.</p>
<pre data-lang="vimscript"><code data-lang="vimscript"><span>nnoremap &lt;D-s&gt; :w&lt;cr&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>nnoremap</code> command maps one set of keystrokes in normal mode to another set of keystrokes.
In this case, it tells Vim that whenever I type <code>&lt;D-s&gt;</code> (Cmd+S), Vim should instead act as <code>:w</code> and then enter (<code>&lt;cr&gt;</code>, it stands for “carriage return”).</p>
<p>I’ve been using iTerm2 on MacOS for years.
Someone at my first job told to install it because it was better than the built-in terminal.
This was in the “frontend and backend are separate repos” phase of web development, and pre-Docker, so there were a lot of services that had to be run at the same time in different terminals.
I learned how to do split panes and that’s pretty much the only terminal feature I’ve ever needed.</p>
