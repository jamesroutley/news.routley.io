    <h1>Introducing the Llama Startup Program</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>We’re excited to announce the <a href="https://www.llama.com/programs/startups/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Llama Startup Program</u></a>, a new initiative to empower early-stage startups to innovate and build generative AI applications with <a href="https://www.llama.com/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Llama</u></a>. Members of the Llama Startup Program will receive resources and support from Llama experts along their journey, including help getting started with Llama and resources necessary to succeed and thrive in a competitive and fast-moving landscape.</p><h2>Why we’re launching the Llama Startup Program</h2><div><p>Early-stage startups are agile and creative, making them uniquely positioned to accelerate high-impact innovation with Llama. In a recent <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/05/new-study-shows-open-source-ai-catalyst-economic-growth/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Linux Foundation study</u></a><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/05/new-study-shows-open-source-ai-catalyst-economic-growth/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">,</a> 94% of organizations say they’ve already adopted AI tools and models, and of those, 89% are using some form of open source technology—such as Llama—in their AI infrastructure.</p><p>We want to give our Llama Startup Program members a competitive edge by offering direct support from the Llama team and may help to fund their use of Llama models. We hope this support accelerates their development process and enhances their ability to deliver innovative solutions. We’ve seen how our <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/llama-impact-grant-recipients/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Llama Impact Grants</u></a> have helped recipients innovate and deliver economic opportunity, and we believe that supporting developers through the Llama Startup Program will help early-stage startups take flight.</p></div></div><div><h2>What are the benefits of being part of the Llama Startup Program?</h2><div><p>During the initial phase of the Llama Startup Program, we&#39;re reimbursing the cost of using Llama through hosted APIs via cloud inference providers. Members may receive up to $6,000 USD per month for up to six months to help them offset the costs of building and enhancing their generative AI solutions. This funding enables startups to experiment, innovate, and scale their solutions without the immediate financial burden, enabling them to focus on what truly matters: creating impactful technologies.</p><p>Members of the program will receive hands-on technical support from the Llama team. Our experts will work closely with them to get started and explore advanced use cases of Llama that could benefit their startups. This direct access to technical expertise ensures that developers can effectively leverage Llama’s capabilities, optimize solutions, and overcome technical challenges they may encounter as they start building.</p></div><h2>Who should apply?</h2><div><p>The Llama Startup Program is an exciting opportunity for early-stage startups in the United States that are ready to innovate with generative AI. We invite startups that are incorporated, have raised less than $10 million USD in funding, and have at least one developer on staff to apply. The Llama Startup Program is ideal for those building generative AI applications across a variety of industries, including technology and software, financial services, healthcare and life sciences, telecommunications, and retail and eCommerce. Join us for the opportunity to receive cloud reimbursements of up to $6,000 USD per month for up to six months, technical resources, and a vibrant community—all while contributing valuable feedback to enhance the Llama experience. If your startup is ready to grow and make a meaningful impact, we encourage you to apply and be part of this transformative program.</p><p>Applications for the initial cohort close on May 30, 2025 at 6:00 pm PT.</p></div></div></div></div>
