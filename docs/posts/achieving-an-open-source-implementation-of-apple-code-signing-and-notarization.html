    <h1>Achieving an open-source implementation of Apple Code Signing and notarization</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
  <p>As I&#39;ve previously blogged in
<a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2021/04/14/pure-rust-implementation-of-apple-code-signing/">Pure Rust Implementation of Apple Code Signing</a>
(2021-04-14) and
<a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2022/04/25/expanding-apple-ecosystem-access-with-open-source,-multi-platform-code-signing/">Expanding Apple Ecosystem Access with Open Source, Multi Platform Code signing</a>
(2022-04-25), I&#39;ve been hacking on an open source implementation of Apple code
signing and notarization using the Rust programming language. This takes the form
of the <code>apple-codesign</code> crate / library and its <code>rcodesign</code> CLI executable.
(<a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/stable/">Documentation</a> /
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/tree/main/apple-codesign">GitHub project</a> /
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/apple-codesign">crates.io</a>).</p>
<p>As of that most recent post in April, I was pretty happy with the relative
stability of the implementation: we were able to sign, notarize, and staple
Mach-O binaries, directory bundles (<code>.app</code>, <code>.framework</code> bundles, etc), XAR
archives / flat packages / <code>.pkg</code> installers, and DMG disk images. Except for
the <a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/0.17.0/apple_codesign_quirks.html">known limitations</a>,
if Apple&#39;s official <code>codesign</code> and <code>notarytool</code> tools support it, so do we.
<strong>This allows people to sign, notarize, and release Apple software from non-Apple
operating systems like Linux and Windows.</strong> This opens up new avenues for
Apple platform access.</p>
<p>A major limitation in previous versions of the <code>apple-codesign</code> crate was our
reliance on Apple&#39;s <a href="https://help.apple.com/itc/transporteruserguide/">Transporter</a>
tool for notarization. Transporter is a Java application made available for macOS,
Linux, and Windows that speaks to Apple&#39;s servers and can upload assets to their
notarization service. I used this tool at the time because it seemed to
be officially supported by Apple and the path of least resistance to standing
up notarization. But Transporter was a bit wonky to use and an extra
dependency that you needed to install.</p>
<p>At WWDC 2022, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10109/">announced</a>
a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/notaryapi">Notary API</a> as
part of the App Store Connect API. In what felt like a wink directly at me,
Apple themselves even calls out the possibility for leveraging this API to
notarize from Linux! I knew as soon as I saw this that it was only a matter
of time before I would be able to replace Transporter with a pure Rust client
for the new HTTP API. (I was already thinking about using the unpublished HTTP
API that <code>notarytool</code> uses. And from the limited reversing notes I have from
before WWDC it looks like the new official Notary API is very similar - possibly
identical to - what <code>notarytool</code> uses. So kudos to Apple for opening up this
access!)</p>
<p><strong>I&#39;m very excited to announce that we now have a pure Rust implementation
of a client for Apple&#39;s Notary API in the <code>apple-codesign</code> crate. This means we
can now notarize Apple software from any machine where you can get the Rust
crate to compile. This means we no longer have a dependency on the 3rd party
Apple Transporter application. Notarization, like code signing, is 100% open
source Rust code.</strong></p>
<p>As excited as I am to announce this new feature, <strong>I&#39;m even more excited that
it was largely implemented by a contributor, Robin Lambertz /
<a href="https://github.com/roblabla">@roblabla</a>!</strong> They
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/591">filed a GitHub feature request</a>
while WWDC 2022 was still ongoing and then <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/pull/593">submitted a PR</a>
a few days later. It took me a few months to get around to reviewing it
(I try to avoid computer screens during summers), but it was a fantastic
PR given the scope of the change. It never ceases to bring joy to me when
someone randomly contributes greatness to open source.</p>
<p>So, as of the just-released <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/releases/tag/apple-codesign%2F0.17.0">0.17 release</a>
of the <code>apple-codesign</code> Rust crate and its corresponding <code>rcodesign</code> CLI tool, you can now
<code>rcodesign notary-submit</code> to speak to Apple&#39;s Notary API using a pure Rust client. No
more requirements on 3rd party, proprietary software. All you need to sign and
notarize Apple applications is the self-contained <code>rcodesign</code> executable and a Linux,
Windows, macOS, BSD, etc machine to run it on.</p>
<p>I&#39;m stoked to finally achieve this milestone! There are probably thousands of
companies and individuals who have wanted to release Apple software from
non-macOS operating systems. (The existence and popularity of tools like
<a href="https://fastlane.tools/">fastlane</a> seems to confirm this.) The historical
lack of an Apple code signing and notarization solution that worked outside
macOS has prevented this. Well, that barrier has officially fallen.</p>
<p>Release notes, documentation, and (self-signed) pre-built executables of the
<code>rcodesign</code> executable for major platforms are available on the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/releases/tag/apple-codesign%2F0.17.0">0.17 release page</a>.</p>
