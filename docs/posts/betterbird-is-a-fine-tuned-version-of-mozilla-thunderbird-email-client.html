<p>
Betterbird is a fine-tuned version of <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net" target="_blank">Mozilla
Thunderbird</a>, Thunderbird on steroids, if you will.</p>
<p>
Betterbird is better than Thunderbird in three ways:
It contains new features exclusive to Betterbird, it contains bug fixes exclusive to Betterbird and it
contains fixes that Thunderbird may ship at a later stage. Please refer to this
<a href="#featuretable">feature table</a> for examples. This should give
you an impression of where the project is headed.
More information on why we&#39;re doing the project can be found at the <a href="https://www.betterbird.eu/faq/index.html">FAQ</a>.
Or just see our ilustrator&#39;s impression:</p>

<p style="color: #d80000; font-weight:bold;">
Note that Thunderbird Beta is still very much work-in-progress with many features destined for version 102 still incomplete and
<a href="https://mzl.la/3aqXLDG" target="_blank">various bugs</a>
not fixed in the current beta version.
Especially note that folder corruption was reported
on various occasions for IMAP folders, so only use the beta version after a backup of your profile.
Please make a backup of your profile before using the beta version.

</p>

<!--
<p style="color: #d80000;">
After initial problems with the 102 series, version 102.2.0 and later should be safe to use. Some work is still in progress, see a list of
<a href="https://mzl.la/3bTAURZ" target="_blank">various bugs</a> not fixed in the 102 series yet.
For important bugs Betterhird 102 already includes fixes, refer to the
<a href="releasenotes/index.html">release notes</a> for details. Please keep this in mind when trying version 102. 
</p>

<h3>Software Quality</h3>
<p>Based on the current situation in version 102, a look at quality assurance, or lack thereof, is appropriate.
Thunderbird has never had an organised quality assurance team, they let the product ripen
at the customer site, at worst causing data loss like for version 102.
The 102 release with mbox and MSF corruption causing data loss and deleted MSF files was nothing short of disastrous.</p>
<p>More and more developers are hired
who contribute more and more changes causing an ever growing number of regressions
(<small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_regression" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:
A software regression is a type of software bug where a feature that has worked before stops working</small>).
The team tracks bugs found in early deployment of a release, and the trend is astounding:
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1573016" target="_blank">Version 68: 43</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1644037" target="_blank">Version 78: 185</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1722793" target="_blank">Version 91: 270</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1772703" target="_blank">Version 102: 384</a> (22 August 2022) and counting.</p>

<p>Thunderbird management has discussed establishing a QA team since 2020, but in the end, funds were spent
on hiring more developers. In this context,
<a href="https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/planning/Tc404795356dcf7e9-M55f7a0b25db5fcfb246ca064" target="_blank">this article</a>
seems to mark the beginning of a new era. But will Thunderbird finally catch up with quality and usability issues?

<h3>Colours</h3>
<p>The red-orange colour scheme is part of the
registered trademark. Red-orange together with a Phoenix-like bird on one hand signify a more aggressive policy and on the other hand a
<a href="https://www.deviantart.com/genzoman/art/Phoenix-202798063" target="_blank">resurrection</a> from the ashes unleashing
the potential of the product while not being bogged down by annoying bugs.</p>
<p>
We&#39;ve had many requests to change the icons to make them better distinguishable from Firefox to avoid mis-clicks.
As the colour scheme is part of the trademark, this is unlikely to happen.
<!-- This is under consideration, however, it entails replacing the artwork in 20+ source files and the question is whether this
effort is warranted and wouldn't be better used elsewhere. -->
</p>

<p>Due to the current situation in Europe, we were featuring the Betterbird logo at this website in Ukrainian colours
from March to July 2022. This has now be replaced by a ribbon of solidarity.</p>
<p>If you want to make your own custom icons, download the green logo or the one in Ukrainian colours:</p>

<p>
Of course the Thunderbird team is busily adding a whole bunch of much welcomed new stuff and improvements, but
making sure that everything remains in working order falls by the wayside. Thunderbird is shipped with
unnecessary regressions, so things that used to work stopped working.</p>
