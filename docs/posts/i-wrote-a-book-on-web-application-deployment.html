    <h1>Show HN: I wrote a book on web application deployment</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h3>Code to get you started</h3>

    <div id="demo">
      <h4>A static website</h4>
      <p>A static website with automatic Let&#39;s Encrypt certificates and system updates. A separate configuration and rootless deployment script.</p>

      <p><i></i> Add server-side analytics and beat the pricing of hosted solutions.</p>

      <h4>A database-backed Ruby on Rails application</h4>
      <p>A single server running a full-featured web application with UNIX sockets, PostgreSQL ident system authentication, Web Sockets, and Let&#39;s Encrypt certificates. A git-push deployment with helpful administration scripts for connecting to the server or handeling file and database backups.</p>

      <p><i></i> Adjust for your application based on the knowledge from the book. Deploy within the same day!</p>

      <h4>A standalone PostgreSQL server</h4>
      <p>A self-sufficient PostgreSQL cluster demo with automatic system upgrades, log rotation, and TLS. Scripts for cluster-wide backups and restores.</p>

      <p><i></i> Run a standalone database when you need more power or to host all your projects&#39; databases in one place.</p>

        <p>All demonstrations are scripted in Bash for CentOS 8 and Rocky Linux 8 systems.</p>

        <p>You don&#39;t need any knowledge of typical configuration management tools. Learn how everything works without abstractions and indirection.</p>

        <h3>Questions answered</h3>

        <h4>Why self-hosting if there is Heroku?</h4>

        <p>There are few good reasons for being more independent on your hosting provider. If your account gets locked, you can easily move your virtual machines to other providers or on-premise. The others being cost, flexibility, or ability to provide a self-hosting option for enterprise customers.</p>

        <p>Maybe staying with managed services like Heroku or Render is the right choice for you. This book is not about convincing you to self-host, but to show you how it&#39;s done.</p>


        <h4>Is this about on-premise?</h4>

        <p>The book&#39;s focus is on self-hosting on virtual machines within a cloud provider where people can conveniently combine self-hosting with hosted services.</p>

        <p>While everything applies to on-premise self-hosting as well, I don&#39;t talk about provisioning the hardware for the virtual machines themselves.</p>


        <h4>What operating system is it for?</h4>

        <p>The book targets Fedora family of systems, mainly the stable CentOS 8 and Rocky Linux 8.</p><p> If you are using other systemd-based operating systems such as Ubuntu, most of the book will still apply as only the package management is truly different (DNF vs APT).</p>

        <h4>I don&#39;t use Ruby or Python. Is this for me?</h4>

        <p>I wanted to write a general book, but writing in an abstract way wouldn&#39;t be that useful. I chose Ruby and Python as popular programming languages for my examples, but before diving into a specific application server setting, I go through everything in theory.</p>

        <p>If you are using another programming language, you&#39;ll have to find these details yourself, but you&#39;ll know what to look for. And even then it&#39;s probably less than 10% of the book.</p>



         <h4>Why Bash?</h4>

        <p>While Bash doesn&#39;t seem like an ideal choice at first, it&#39;s surprisingly ubiquitous. Linux packages&#39; specification files are in Bash, version managers like chruby and pyenv are in Bash, Dockerfiles and their entrypoints are practically Bash. </p>
        <p>Above all, I chose Bash to show everything without deep abstractions, so you know what&#39;s going on every step of the way.</p>
