    <h1>Introduction to TCP and Sockets (2001)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>This section is an introduction to TCP/IP programming
        using a sockets API. (Sockets can also be used to work with
        other network protocols, such as IPX/SPX and Appletalk, but
        that is beyond the scope of this document.) The standard
        socket API was originally developed in the Unix world, but
        has been ported to OS/400 as part of the &#34;Unix-type&#34; APIs,
        and a modified version was also ported to the Windows
        platform under the name &#34;Windows Sockets&#34; (or &#34;Winsock&#34; for
        short)</p>

        <p>Usually when someone refers to &#34;TCP/IP&#34; they are
        referring to the entire suite of protocols, all based on
        the Internet Protocol (&#34;IP&#34;). Unlike a single network,
        where every computer is directly connected to every other
        computer, an &#34;inter-network&#34; (or &#34;internet&#34;) is a
        collection of one or more networks. These networks are all
        connected together to form a larger &#34;virtual network&#34;. Any
        host on this virtual network can exchange data with any
        other host, by referring to the hosts &#34;address&#34;.</p>

        <p>The address is a 32-bit number which is unique across
        the entire internet. Typically, this number is broken into
        4 8-bit pieces, separated by periods to make it easier for
        humans to read. This human readable format is called
        &#34;dotted-decimal&#34; format, or just &#34;dot-notation&#34;. An address
        displayed in this fashion looks something like
        &#34;192.168.66.21&#34;.</p>

        <p>Different parts of this &#34;IP Address&#34; are used to
        identify which network a host is located on, and the rest
        of the address is used to identify the host itself. Which
        part of the address and which part is the host is
        determined by a &#34;network mask&#34; (or &#34;netmask&#34; for short.)
        The netmask is another 32-bit number which acts like like a
        &#34;guide&#34; to the IP address. Each bit that is turned on in
        the netmask means that the corresponding bit in the IP
        address is part of the network&#39;s address. Each bit that is
        turned off means that the corresponding bit in the IP
        address is part of the host&#39;s address.</p>

        <p>Here&#39;s an example of an IP address and netmask:</p>

        
<pre>                           dotted-decimal   same number in binary format:
                           --------------   -----------------------------------
            IP Address:    192.168.66.21    11000000 10101000 01000010 00010101
               Netmask:    255.255.255.0    11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
      
       Network Address is: 192.168.66       11000000 10101000 01000010  
          Host Address is:           .21                               00010101
       
</pre>
