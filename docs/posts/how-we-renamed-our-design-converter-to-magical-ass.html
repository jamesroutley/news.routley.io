    <h1>How we renamed our Design Converter to Magical Ass</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>So here we go, our rebranding is done. New logo, new domain, what could go wrong.<p>We provide a tool to convert design files between Figma, XD, Sketch, Figma, PDF and more and have recently rebranded it from &#34;XD2Sketch&#34; to &#34;Magicul&#34;. We started out as a simple tool to allow users to import XD files in Sketch hence the name XD2Sketch but soon added more features. The name just didn&#39;t make sense anymore. Magicul initially seemed to be a great name, but turned out to be a bit of an interesting pick when translated to French.</p><p>We&#39;ve sent out a newsletter to our customers to let them know about the changes and here&#39;s what one of our users replied:</p><p><i>Hey folks,</i></p><p><i>While I understand that you guys probably hope to operate primarily in English, I think it needs to be mentioned that your brand name &#34;Magicul&#34; in french, literally means &#34;Magical ass&#34;... but the real kicker is the .io of the domain, which literally means input &amp; output...</i></p><p><i>So here goes the bad news... The entire french community is reading your brand name - literally - as: Magical ass (dot) in &amp; out.</i></p><p><i>And then there&#39;s the logo itself... which is a hole with a hat.</i></p><p><i>Christ. You can&#39;t make this stuff up. This is ugh, umm, a brutally unfortunate brand?...lol</i></p><p><i>I&#39;m in Quebec, Canada, where french is dominant and so I&#39;m keenly aware of this - and so are my partners, colleagues and friends. We all had a good laugh.</i></p><p><i>Don&#39;t know what else to say...?</i></p><p><i>Bonne chance mes amis!</i></p><p><i>Have a good one,</i></p><p><i>- A fan of your work in Montreal.</i></p><p>You can checkout our website here: https://magicul.io</p><p>I just thought this was too hilarious to not share.</p></td></div></div>
