            <p>
                Shapez 2 is a challenging but easy-to-learn factory building game, similar to Factorio or
                Satisfactory. Automate the processing of geometric shapes, build massive factories and find
                the best strategy to solve the increasingly complex <strong>logistical puzzles</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>Gameplay Strategy</h2>
            <p>
                Automate the processing of abstract geometric shapes into more complex ones by cutting,
                rotating, stacking, painting and more. Deliver distinct shapes to unlock new technologies and
                expand your factory&#39;s capabilities. Learn, improve, rebuild and solve logistical challenges &amp;
                puzzles to design the most efficient shape production lines.
            </p>

            <p>
                Build in multiple interconnected layers, allowing you to compact and optimize your factories
                in a whole new dimension. Improve your designs to get the most benefit out of every space
                platform built and massively increase your production throughput.
            </p>

            <h2>No enemies</h2>
            <p>
                Shapez 2 is the purest factory building game imaginable - all buildings are free, resources
                never run out and there are no enemies or time limits. Prepare for a 100% factory-building
                experience: effortlessly delete, redesign and rebuild as much as you want, with no penalties,
                at your own pace.
            </p>

            <p>
                You&#39;re always in complete control - whether the messy spaghetti belts you built 4 hours ago
                could use some improvements or a whole circle factory needs to go, Shapez 2 gives you the
                tools to do it without limitations.
            </p>

            <h2>Massive Factories &amp; Puzzles</h2>
            <p>
                Start your operation from a single asteroid and continuously expand by building new platforms.
                Unlock new layouts as you progress, and grow from a single belt into a massive multi-station
                space factory connected by space trains. Design modular blueprintable platforms to build on a
                massive scale, placing hundreds of buildings with just one click.
            </p>

            <p>
                Performance is very important to us, and with the complete rewrite of Shapez 2 in a new
                engine, we&#39;re doing our best to make sure that massive factories run smoothly - even with the
                all-new 3D visuals!
