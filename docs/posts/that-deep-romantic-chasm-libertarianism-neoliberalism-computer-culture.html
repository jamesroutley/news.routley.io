      <p>[This is a draft of an essay that was published in in Andrew Calabrese
        and Jean-Claude Burgelman, eds., <i>Communication, Citizenship, and
          Social Policy: Re-Thinking the Limits of the Welfare State</i>, Rowman
        &amp; Littlefield, 1999, pp. 49-64.]</p>
    </center>
    
    <p>One step in the process of constructing a viable alternative to the
      neoliberal paradigm in communication policy is developing an understanding
      of why neoliberalism is so popular. It is important to counter the
      neoclassical economist&#39;s answer to that question -- &#34;it&#39;s rational&#34; -- by
      pointing to the many contradictions, irrationalities, and failures of
      neoclassically-based policies (e.g., Streeter, 1996). But as with most or
      all successful political movements, the power of neoliberalism does not
      seem to be purely a matter of scholarly argument. Furthermore, while it is
      true that part of neoliberalism&#39;s success can be explained in terms of the
      corporate interests it serves, this is not always the case. As Robert
      Horwitz (1989) and others have pointed out, some forms of market-oriented
      policy have been instituted against the opposition of industry. And in any
      case the broad political legitimacy of reforms undertaken on behalf of
      businesses need to be explained. So the question remains: Why is the
      current quasi-religious faith in markets as the solution to all problems
      so compelling to so many? What makes it seem reasonable, forward-thinking,
      even a little bit thrilling? </p>
    <p>This chapter suggests that the answer lies, not just in economic or
      technological logics, but also in cultural ones. This chapter focuses on
      the careers and styles of two key figures in the development of today&#39;s
      &#34;net culture,&#34; Stewart Brand and Theodor Nelson, and explores some
      elements of the politics of the culture of computers. On the one hand,
      this essay confirms and elaborates an argument made or suggested by
      others, notably by Barbrook and Cameron in &#34;The Californian Ideology&#34;
      (1996) and Frank (1997) in <i>The Conquest of Cool</i>, that the computer
      culture can be understood as a deeply contradictory but politically very
      powerful fusion of `60s countercultural attitude with a revived form of
      political libertarianism. Exploring the history and structure of that
      fusion, I believe, helps explain both neoliberalism&#39;s success and how it
      might be undone.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, this chapter elaborates on aspects of the &#34;structure
      of feeling&#34; of that fusion (Williams, 1961, pp. 48-71). The &#34;deep romantic
      chasm&#34; of my title is a line from Coleridge&#39;s poem <i>Kubla Khan</i>; I
      use it not just as an echo of one of the first visions of a world wide
      web, Theodor Nelson&#39;s <i>Xanadu</i> project, but also to suggest that an
      important component of net libertarianism rests more on a romantic notion
      of individualism, based on an expressive, exploring, transfiguring idea of
      the individual, than the calculating, pleasure-maximizing utilitarian
      individual characteristic of conservative economic theory. There are
      positive lessons to be learned from this romantic individualism, both in
      its compelling, popular character and in the key role it has played in
      technological and social innovation. But, as the word &#34;chasm&#34; suggests,
      this romantic individualism is limited: it is ultimately based on a
      pathological and illusory vision of isolation and escape from history and
      social context, which becomes evident in the expressive styles of net
      culture, the particularly obsessive fascination with interaction through
      the computer screen, and also in some of the policy directions advocated
      by the culture, especially those involving intellectual property.</p>
    
    <p>It&#39;s easy, as many do, to dismiss the computer culture as merely an
      adolescent subculture whose values and principles hardly matter beyond the
      video game market. But, while certainly not at the center of today&#39;s power
      structures, the computer culture can be understood as standing in complex
      relations to the hegemonic bloc in the Gramscian sense. Members of the
      culture are fond of pointing out how the corporate and government worlds
      have been repeatedly wrong about or slow to catch on to developments that
      the computer culture pioneered, such as microcomputers, networking, user
      friendly interfaces, multimedia, and the internet. So most obviously,
      netizens function as sources of innovation, as inventors and pioneers
      serving as a useful corrective to corporate myopia. Furthermore, among
      policymakers, both the products of the computer culture and to a lesser
      degree the culture itself often serve as archetypal examples of the
      marketplace in action. The new computer culture has become a political
      icon or ideogram: in many a policymaking mind today, the rapid global
      dissemination of microcomputers and the internet stand as models of what&#39;s
      good about the market. And these days, the computer culture itself has
      produced quite a few prominent cheerleaders for marketplace policies. </p>
    <p>A full accounting of the impact of the computer culture on industrial and
      political decision making is far beyond the scope of this paper. But as an
      illustration of its effect, it seems likely that the computer culture has
      played an important role in one of the more important communication policy
      issues of our time: the headlong rush to privatize the internet. The
      explosion of the internet in the early 1990s left the mainstream corporate
      worlds surprised and bewildered; they had spent the previous decade
      investing in proprietary commercial on-line services like Prodigy, and yet
      suddenly here was a superior system they neither controlled nor
      understood. One might have explained the internet&#39;s success in terms of
      its nonprofit origins and nonproprietary organizing principles; the
      principles of open cooperation that are to some degree built into its
      design and that have encouraged its rapid global spread arguably reflect
      the ethic of sharing and collective inquiry common to the research
      universities that fostered the internet&#39;s development in the 1980s.
      Instead, at roughly the same time that Mosaic (the &#34;killer app&#34; of the
      internet) appeared, <i>Wired</i> magazine, the libertarian Electronic
      Frontier Foundation, and similar organs of the computer counterculture
      offered us another interpretation: the internet was a triumph, not of
      nonprofit principles or of cooperation between government and the private
      sector, but of a kind of romantic marketplace entrepreneurialism -- a
      &#34;frontier.&#34; As this interpretation seeped into policymaking circles and
      eventually became the &#34;common sense&#34; of the day, any policy lessons that
      might have been learned from the internet&#39;s nonprofit origins thus have
      been roundly ignored. Since the early `90s, the only question has been how
      to completely commercialize the system, not whether or not to do it.</p>
    
    <p>Many of the computer culture&#39;s more prominent proponents came to
      political awareness while protesting the Viet Nam war, and much of the
      culture&#39;s style and attitude has clear roots in the `60s. Stewart Brand,
      for example, created and edited the countercultural compendium, the <i>Whole
        Earth Catalog</i>, and his <i>Coevolution Quarterly</i> was guest
      edited by the Black Panthers in 1974 (Kleiner, 1986, p. 331). Yet <i>Coevolution
        Quarterly</i> eventually evolved into a computer software catalog, and
      today Brand is known as a technology booster, a fellow traveler with the
      editorial staff of <i>Wired Magazine</i> which not long ago featured Newt
      Gingrich on its cover. As a group, Brand and his cohort have become
      important promoters of contemporary economic conservatism.<a href="#fn0" name="fnB0">[1]</a>
    </p>
    <p>The term cybernetics, coined by Norbert Weiner in the late 1940s, came
      out of a set of interactions among intellectuals that included Gregory
      Bateson and Margaret Mead. Bateson, who to my knowledge never cared much
      about computers, went on to develop both a set of ideas about systems
      theory, ecology, and the human mind and a particularly effective pop
      writing style for presenting those ideas. In the `70s, Stewart Brand went
      on to elevate Bateson to the status of guru, particularly in the pages of
      <i>Coevolution Quarterly</i>. And then in the early 1980s, <i>Coevolution
        Quarterly</i> evolved into the <i>Whole Earth Software Review</i>,
      essays about solar power were replaced by reviews of the latest computer
      software, and <i>Coevolution</i>&#39;s nonprofit egalitarian principles
      (e.g., all employees received the same pay) were replaced by a for-profit
      inegalitarian salary structure<a href="#fn1" name="fnB1">[2]</a>; several
      of the key figures in this 1980s evolution, like Art Kleiner and Kevin
      Kelly, went on to become founders and contributors to <i>Wired </i>magazine.
      Throughout this kaleidoscopic four-decade process the term &#34;cybernetics&#34;
      remains a constant.</p>
    <p>The role in all this of Gregory Bateson (and Stewart Brand&#39;s
      interpretation of him) is instructive. Bateson&#39;s books from the late `60s,
      the most famous of which was <i>Steps to an Ecology of Mind</i> (1972),
      were written in a highly accessible, engaging way that eschewed academic
      jargon and reference; the style was that of a kind of hip, charming
      version of the voice of the British gentleman amateur. Highly abstract
      ideas about systems theory, for example, are put in the mouth of a six
      year old girl chatting with her father. Hence, college students and
      literate hippies across the land, and even some precocious high school
      students, could curl up in a bean bag with one of Bateson&#39;s books and make
      some sense of it without the guidance of professors. Bateson was an
      anti-Derrida.</p>
    <p>In the <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i>, Brand added to this accessible but
      thoughtful style a non-linear, playful form of presentation that mixed
      descriptions of non-flush toilets with political tracts, a novel, and
      iconoclastic journalism -- it was in the <i>Catalog</i> that most of the
      U.S. finally learned how astronauts went to the bathroom. On the one hand,
      the style expressed the &#34;everything is related&#34; holism of Batesonian
      systems theory. But it was also the case that the <i>Catalog</i> was made
      for browsing. Certainly, the accessible, cluttered style of the <i>Catalog</i>
      shared something with the general style of the consumer culture; reading
      the <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i> in the early 1970s was probably fun in
      much the same way the reading the Sears catalog was in the 1890s. But the
      <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i> stood apart from the rest of the consumer
      culture in important ways: it was information rich, deliberately lacked
      glitz, and was not about consuming products for leisure time activities
      but -- in its own mind at least -- about understanding and building things
      for everyday life. To a whole generation of readers, and I think still to
      some extent today, this kind of writing is a breath of fresh air; its
      frankness and thoughtfulness was an antidote to the breezy, sugar-coated,
      condescending, anti-intellectual tone of much of the pop media, whereas
      its accessibility contrasted with the jargon-ridden, mystified styles that
      permeate our academic, government, and corporate bureaucracies.</p>
    <p>Until the mid-1970s, one of the icons of those bureaucracies was the
      computer: for most of the culture, mainframe computers seemed to exemplify
      the mysterious, technological unfriendliness of our modern institutions.
      It was in the fusion of computer technical communities with features of
      countercultural practice and belief that this view of the computer began
      to change. Some of the origins of the shift in the character of the
      computer are probably familiar to many because of their mythologizing in
      the press: the computer hobbyist community in which Bill Gates and Steven
      Jobs both got their start, and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)
      which did much to invent or first implement the windows, mice, networks,
      and graphic interfaces that now grace our desks. But fewer (outside the
      computer culture) are familiar with the work of Theodor Nelson, the man
      who coined the term hypertext and claims to have invented the concept of
      linked electronic texts that led to the World Wide Web and the explosion
      in popularity of the internet.</p>
    <p>Nelson clearly played a pioneering role in fostering the intellectual
      environment that made possible subsequent industrial developments; his
      intellectual influence on both the microcomputer revolution and the
      surprising success of the internet is arguably much greater than that of
      any of the computer impresarios that are in every technology reporter&#39;s
      Rolodex, like Nicholas Negroponte. Nelson&#39;s magnum opus was a book first
      published in 1974 called <i>Computer Lib</i>. It was essentially a
      transposition of the style, format, and countercultural iconoclasm of the
      <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i> into the world of computers.<a href="#fn2" name="fnB2">[3]</a>
      It&#39;s impossible to establish exactly how widely read <i>Computer Lib</i>
      was, but it seems likely that most of those in attendance at the &#34;West
      Coast Computer Faire&#34; and similar now-legendary venues had at least some
      familiarity with Nelson and his work, and Nelson himself reports glowingly
      on a visit to Xerox PARC in the mid-1970s (Nelson, 1974b, p. X).<a href="#fn3" name="fnB3">[4]</a>
      (I know at least one computer professional who told me, &#34;<i>Computer Lib</i>
      changed my life&#34;; Nelson claims to have encountered at least fifty such
      individuals [1987, p. 9]) And Nelson did frequently publish essays in
      science and computer journals, and served for a time as editor of one of
      the first pop computer magazines, <i>Creative Computing</i> (Anderson,
      1984, p. 74).</p>
    <p><i>Computer Lib</i> is full of concepts and approaches to computer use
      that were then unusual but have since become commonplace.<a href="#fn4" name="fnB4">[5]</a>
      User-friendly interfaces, small personal-sized computers, mice, graphic
      interfaces, and non-computational uses of computers like word-processing,
      email, multimedia, and hypertext are all elaborately explained and
      advocated. He even anticipates contemporary buzz words: eighteen years
      before &#34;web surfing&#34; spread throughout the culture, Nelson wrote, &#34;If
      computers are the wave of the future, displays are the surfboards&#34;
      (Nelson, 1974b, p. 22).<a href="#fn5" name="fnB5">[6]</a> And Nelson
      articulates grandiose notions about computers&#39; liberatory potential that
      are now standard fare among netizens, claiming that &#34;Knowledge,
      understanding and freedom can all be advanced by the promotion and
      deployment of computer display consoles (with the right programs behind
      them)&#34; (p. 58).</p>
    <p>The style of <i>Computer Lib</i> is resonant with both that of Bateson
      and the <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i>.<sup>7</sup> The book criticizes and
      pokes fun at the mystifying jargon in which computers were then typically
      described. &#34;I believe in calling a spade a spade -- not a personalized
      earth-moving equipment module,&#34; Nelson quipped (1974b, p. 58). The
      language is deliberately playful and non-Latinate: computers are described
      as &#34;wind-up crossword puzzles.&#34; And a loose sympathy with countercultural
      politics and iconoclasm is also present: Nelson boasts of having been at
      Woodstock (1974b, p. 2), associates his critique of the computer
      profession with the feminist critique of the medical profession in <i>Our
        Bodies Ourselves</i> (1974a, p. 2), inserts a solemn paean to no-growth
      economics (1974a, p. 63), and puts a black-power style raised fist on the
      cover. And the book&#39;s hand-drawn graphics, paste-up style, and
      self-published origin -- Nelson brags about eschewing mainstream
      publishers -- all bespeak an anti-establishment sentiment (albeit an
      undertheorized one).</p>
    
    <p>How did all this countercultural iconoclasm applied to computers
      metamorphose into a hotbed of neoliberalism? Almost as an afterthought,
      Nelson raised the problem of funding a universally available hypertext
      computer system in a brief passage: Can it be done? I dunno. . . . My
      assumption is that the way to this is <i>not</i> through big business
      (since all these corporations see is other corporations); <i>not</i>
      through government (hypertext is not committee-oriented, but
      individualistic -- and grants can only be gotten through sesquipedalian
      and obfuscatory pompizzazz); but through the byways of the private
      enterprise system. I think the same spirit that gave us McDonald&#39;s and
      kandy kolor hot rod accessories may pull us through here (1974b, p. 45).
      In keeping with the pop-Marxism common in the early `70s counterculture,
      Nelson thus sees both corporations and government as similarly suspect.
      But the allusion to Tom Wolfe is telling: his solution is not the Marxist,
      but the libertarian one of free markets, imagined as if they could exist
      without supporting institutional structures like government and
      corporations. </p>
    <p>Nelson&#39;s faith in the marketplace was by no means unique among the
      computer community. In the mid-1970s, the young Bill Gates was also trying
      to convince his fellow computer hobbyists in venues like early computer
      magazines that they should stop sharing software and start paying each
      other for it (Cringely, 1996, p. 55). But Gates clearly had a
      straightforward business model in mind. However sound his arguments may
      have seemed to many, they had no countercultural cachÈ.</p>
    <p>Nelson&#39;s vision, in contrast, is rooted in a romantic, not utilitarian,
      form of individualism. He was not envisioning himself as simply a
      pragmatic, self-interested businessman. He never mentioned markets,
      profitability, or business incentives. His writings bespeak a passion for
      inquiry and experimentation for their own sake, and a disdain for
      traditional business practices and shallow economic self-interest. And, in
      any case, by most accounts his major efforts to launch or participate in
      business ventures have been disasters (Wolf, 1995, p. 137).</p>
    <p>The romantic character of Nelson&#39;s individualism is most evident in his
      proposals for a hypertext system called Xanadu, which helped inspire the
      World Wide Web and which, appropriately enough, is named after the exotic
      &#34;pleasure palace&#34; in Coleridge&#39;s opium-induced poem Kubla Khan. Xanadu was
      described in <i>Computer Lib</i> and has apparently been Nelson&#39;s life&#39;s
      work ever since; as of this writing, after one major failed attempt to
      develop the system under a corporate umbrella, a small group in Australia
      seems to be carrying the flame for the project (Nelson, 1997a).</p>
    <p>Xanadu, according to Nelson, is supposed to be a computer-based system of
      &#34;connected literature&#34; that&#39;s easily accessible worldwide, much like
      today&#39;s World Wide Web. But with an important difference: &#34;the system,&#34;
      Nelson says, &#34;must guarantee that the owner of any information will be
      paid their chosen royalties on any portions of their documents, no matter
      how small, whenever they are most used&#34; (Nelson, 1997b). Nelson thus has
      always been opposed to those, like Richard Stallman, who argue that
      computer software should be freely distributed (Nelson, 1974b, p. 158).8
      His argument is on the surface a recapitulation of the (highly
      questionable) common sense of intellectual property law in the US:
      &#34;[C]opyright,&#34; he argues, &#34;makes publishing, and the better computer
      software, possible&#34; (Nelson, 1974a, p. 3).</p>
    <p>It&#39;s crucial, however, that Nelson&#39;s desire to uphold an intellectual
      property system seems to have been, not fostering an industry, but a
      certain vision of fairness: &#34;You publish something, anyone can use it, you
      always get a royalty automatically. Fair.&#34; The vision is of an isolated,
      &#34;free&#34; individual who communicates without the mediation of publishers,
      libraries, or educational institutions. This economic fairness, moreover,
      is of a piece with intellectual fairness: &#34;You can create new published
      documents out of old ones indefinitely, making whatever changes seem
      appropriate -- without damaging the originals. This means a whole new
      pluralistic publishing form. If anything which is already published can be
      included in anything newly published, any new viewpoint can be fairly
      presented&#34; (Nelson, 1983, chap. 2, p. 38). With Xanadu, each individual
      contribution to the system is perfectly preserved and perfectly rewarded:
      the computer system itself is supposed to prevent the possibility of
      unattributed theft of ideas because each &#34;quotation&#34; is preserved by an
      unalterable link that not only allows readers to instantly call up
      intellectual sources but that also ensures direct payment for each &#34;use.&#34;9
      It&#39;s a vision of a mathematically perfect property system, of Lockean
      abstractions made manifest by computer technology.</p>
    <p>By standard measures, Nelson&#39;s career has been a checkered one on the
      margins of the same commercial and educational computing communities that
      have been so deeply influenced by his ideas. With that in mind, there&#39;s
      something poignant about his vision: it&#39;s the vision of an outsider, never
      entirely secure or well-rewarded by institutions -- who&#39;s never been
      treated &#34;fairly&#34; -- who imagines a utopia in which those &#34;unfair&#34;
      institutions are supplanted altogether by communities of free individuals
      working at computer consoles. It&#39;s a utopia where there are no arbitrary
      powers like IBM&#39;s monopoly or arbitrarily powerful authorities with
      careers built on glad-handing or hot air; a utopia where no tenured
      journal editors can prevent one&#39;s article from reaching publication, and
      no short-sighted corporate executive can arbitrarily deep-six a beloved
      project on behalf of cost-cutting. Nor can any of these people claim an
      underling&#39;s idea as their own.</p>
    <p>By most accounts (though not by Nelson&#39;s), Xanadu itself has been a
      failure; it&#39;s the mother of all vaporware. Nelson&#39;s writings for the last
      quarter century are full of unfulfilled predictions of the system&#39;s
      imminent completion and publication; to this day Nelson insists that a
      viable working system is just around the corner (Nelson, 1997a). Wired
      magazine published a lengthy history of Xanadu, titled &#34;A Hacker Tragedy,&#34;
      which depicted the effort as a Quixotic and fundamentally impractical
      effort driven more by neurosis than by programming ability or vision
      (Wolf, 1995). While I am not competent to evaluate the specifics of the
      software (which in any case remain largely proprietary), I&#39;d hazard a
      guess that part of the impossibility of the effort may be of a piece with
      Nelson&#39;s vision of property. The logarithmically increasing demands on
      computing resource that such a perfect system would demand (each
      alteration recorded, each reading generating compensation for each author,
      a complete record or all such transactions accessible to all throughout
      the system) may have been its technological Waterloo; in conventional
      economic language, the system would probably drown in its own &#34;transaction
      costs.&#34;</p>
    <p>The tragic impossibility of Xanadu may be of a piece with the dream that
      motivates it: a dream of community unmediated by the complex burdens of
      history and institutions, of individual creativity without the ties of
      social context. What&#39;s missing from Nelson&#39;s view of the world, of course,
      is a sense of the determining character of history, politics, and social
      complexity; his dream, in fact, is precisely to overcome the arbitrary
      hierarchies and messy interconnectedness of our imperfect world, not by
      struggling with that interconnectedness but by escaping from it into the
      computer screen. That&#39;s why, in all the countless computer utopias we&#39;ve
      seen depicted over the last fifteen years, no one changes any diapers. In
      Nelson&#39;s visions of cyberspace, as in so many others, there&#39;s no
      particular sense of people eating, growing food, getting old or sick, or
      building roads, houses and factories. There&#39;s generally an absence of,
      even a disdain for, bodies: actual human bodies are often cavalierly
      dismissed as mere &#34;meat&#34; in net culture, and the real world described as
      &#34;meat space&#34; (Dery, 1997).</p>
    <p>The entire transaction cost problem in neoclassical economic theory is
      itself an effort to account for economic &#34;externalities&#34;; all that messy
      political and social stuff that doesn&#39;t fit the conventional economic
      models of isolated individuals competing in a marketplace. In Nelson&#39;s
      computer utopia, as in most such visions, there&#39;s little sense of any of
      the constitutive character of even the most immediate of those
      &#34;externalities&#34;: the expensive educational systems and the massive
      government funding of science and defense that provided the context for
      all the computer-oriented experimentation, speculation, and reflection
      like Nelson&#39;s. The fact that computer experts are overwhelmingly
      well-educated middle and upper class white males working in cozy research
      campuses of universities and corporations is studiously ignored. The
      social conditions that formed the background conditions for the computer
      culture and its accomplishments of the `70s and `80s -- patriarchy, class
      relations, the wide availability of higher education in the `50s and `60s
      through government programs like the GI bill -- are rendered invisible.
      The oft-told story of Bill Gates learning about computers in high school
      and then dropping out of Harvard to found Microsoft is treated as an
      example of classic entrepreneurial pluck, as if Gates were some modern day
      Robinson Crusoe operating in isolation from social support; the profound
      difference in social power available to the young man from a wealthy
      family who drops out of Harvard compared to, say, one who drops out of an
      inner city high school, or to a woman who drops out of college to have a
      baby, disappears from the computer libertarian scenarios. The expensive
      computer that Gates learned on in high school is treated like a fact of
      nature, not the product of the well-funded school system of the type
      increasingly available only to the privileged.</p>
    
    <p>The means by which the eventual marriage of the computer counterculture&#39;s
      libertarianism with today&#39;s conservative movement were accomplished are
      well illustrated by Stewart Brand&#39;s (1987) celebratory book about MIT&#39;s
      Media Lab. Brand opens with an epigraph that dedicates the book to the
      &#34;drafters and defenders of the First Amendment&#34; and that describes the
      Amendment as &#34;Elegant code by witty programmers.&#34; Here in a nutshell are
      the characteristic tropes of the computer culture: wry wit, iconoclasm,
      and a breathtakingly naive denial of history and social process. For as
      any legal historian and most lawyers know, the First Amendment, whatever
      its merits, is not at all like computer code. It has never functioned with
      the automatic, mechanical certainty of a computer program. Its
      contemporary meanings in American law are barely half a century old; in
      the nineteenth century, for example, it was frequently interpreted to mean
      that censorship was discouraged at the federal level, but completely
      legitimate at the local and state levels. A computer program executes
      itself in the same way each time, regardless of who is operating the
      computer; a legal principle, in contrast, is interpreted differently
      depending on its social and historical context. The current strong
      interpretation of the First Amendment in the U.S. is a political
      accomplishment, a result of complex social and ideological struggles, not
      a result of feeding the Bill of Rights into a neutral legal machine
      (Kairys, 1990; Streeter, 1995). </p>
    <p>Yet the fantasy that laws do work that way is a key commonality between
      the current rising conservative tide and the otherwise disparate computer
      culture. A radical distinction between law and politics is central to the
      libertarian faith; law, the theory goes, underpins a system of individual
      liberties neutrally and mechanically, whereas government involves the
      arbitrary and subjective political interference with those rights. Clever
      and elegant legal codes by witty legal programmers allow us to be
      self-interested, unattached, free individuals, monads in a marketplace,
      whereas government coerces us into repressive collectives. That&#39;s why
      conservatives can imagine there&#39;s no contradiction between their frequent
      calls for law and order and their criticisms of government intrusion into
      our lives. The fantasy that law works like a computer code, in sum,
      undergirds the denial of history, social structure, and political struggle
      that is central to the libertarian faith in markets, at least in its more
      naive forms. The habits of thought that metamorphosed from sixties
      countercultural social libertarianism into technology-based economic
      libertarianism, and eventually lent credibility to today&#39;s dominant
      neoliberalism, thus rely on a metaphorical interfusion of law with
      computers, in which each is imagined to function like the other.</p>
    <p>Ted Nelson&#39;s faith in the ahistorical formalist understanding of law
      becomes clear when he defends his insistence on copyright protection: I&#39;ve
      heard . . . arguments, like `Copyright means getting the lawyers
      involved.&#39; This has it approximately backwards. The law is ALWAYS
      involved; it is CLEAN ARRANGEMENTS of law that keep the lawyers away. . .
      . If the rights are clear and exact, they are less likely to get stepped
      on, and it takes less to straighten matters out if they are. Believe it or
      not, lawyers LIKE clean arrangements. `Hard cases make bad law,&#39; goes the
      saying (Nelson, 1997b). Most of those familiar with the historical details
      of intellectual property law would probably be more than a little
      skeptical of the idea that intellectual property can be rendered into such
      &#34;clean arrangements.&#34; Based as it is on such nebulous notions as
      &#34;originality&#34; and the distinction between an idea and its expression,
      intellectual property is a famously shifting and murky area of the law,
      replete with qualifying complications like fair use, copyright
      collectives, and compulsory licensing. Intellectual property is a classic
      example of a form of property where, as one famous essay on property law
      put it, &#34;crystals turn to mud&#34; (Rose, 1988). With <i>Xanadu</i>, of
      course, Nelson promises a technological fix to all this murkiness. But
      historical experience and a little common sense would suggest that the fit
      between technologies and intellectual property has only grown murkier as
      technologies have grown more sophisticated. The internet and the World
      Wide Web in particular, though they do embody much of Nelson&#39;s utopian
      fantasy, blur rather than clarify the boundaries of authorship and
      intellectual property that were central to his vision; it&#39;s easier than
      ever before to copy someone else&#39;s work without attribution, and
      uncertainty in the realm of intellectual property is one of the major
      legal and policy issues of the day.</p>
    <p>Both the passionate attachment to the formalist vision of law and its
      naivetÈ became abundantly clear when Congress added the porn-prohibiting
      Communications Decency Act to the `96 Telecommunications Act, and the
      computer culture flew into a libertarian high dudgeon over the CDA.
      Computer pundit Brock Meeks, for example, flooded the internet with
      outraged diatribes, frequently repeating the query &#34;Which part of NO LAW
      don&#39;t you understand?&#34; -- as if no one could read the amendment and
      interpret it differently. (The fact that for 150 years the best trained
      jurists in the land <i>did</i> read the First Amendment quite differently
      seemed to have escaped Meeks&#39; consciousness.) Similarly, the EFF&#39;s John
      Perry Barlow distributed an outraged &#34;Declaration of Independence of
      Cyberspace,&#34; as if the CDA were the last straw that would precipitate a
      popular rebellion against governments world wide. As the First Amendment
      is a favorite topic of reporters, the flap over the CDA became the primary
      focus of press coverage of the `96 Act, the only element of the Act that
      had any controversy associated with it.</p>
    <p>In fact, the CDA takes up less than a page of the nearly 100-page act,
      and was correctly understood by many at the outset as unenforceable and
      unconstitutional. The bulk of the Act, by contrast, is a rather typical
      piece of corporate welfare, handing out various favors to corporate
      interests while creating some behavioral ground rules that provide
      industry overall with stability and protection from cutthroat competition
      during a period of organizational and technological change. The key
      progressive component of the Act, one with important implications for
      fostering the open, public debate that is the goal of free speech law, was
      arguably the creation of a universal service fund for schools and
      libraries. Yet all this was accomplished by elaborate inside-the-beltway
      maneuvering, and even the universal service issue escaped any widespread
      public debate, even on the internet. In retrospect, it seems probable that
      the computer culture&#39;s loud objections to the CDA, rather than promoting
      the cause of freedom, in fact served to deflect attention from the much
      more important, and in the long term, more freedom-restricting
      pro-corporate components of the `96 Act. One of the more enduring legacies
      of computer libertarianism may be the way it served to distract attention
      from the core of the `96 Act, thus ensuring its easy passage.</p>
    
    <p>There&#39;s much of value in the computer culture and its legacy. It&#39;s
      important that people like Ted Nelson were more right about the future of
      computers than the bulk of the managers who controlled decision making in
      the electronics industry; the computer culture was on to something. And
      its success has helped keep alive a respect for iconoclasm. While I think
      the dominant impact of <i>Wired</i> was conservative and co-optive, it&#39;s
      intriguing that, for a few years during the height of its popularity,
      business managers across the land were thumbing through a magazine that
      would routinely include observations like, &#34;One of the dirty secrets of
      capitalism is that the harder you work the less you get paid.&#34; </p>
    <p>The most important lesson of the computer counterculture is that the
      dramatic success of the internet, of small computers, of
      user-friendliness, of open systems, and of hypermedia are evidence of a
      widespread desire for connection and cooperation in a context free of the
      private and public hierarchies that so often dominate our lives. Unlike
      the standard conservative marketplace fables in which we&#39;re told that all
      will be well if we dedicate ourselves to the selfish, calculating pursuit
      of the profit motive, computer utopians like Ted Nelson and Stewart Brand
      celebrate pleasures of unrestricted <i>communication</i>, of connection
      with others, pleasures that are both aesthetically and intellectually
      creative and social and that cannot be reduced to the calculating
      self-interest of <i>homo economicus</i>. Nelson&#39;s vision of computers was
      always one in which computers are interlinked and used creatively in
      liberatory ways, in which they are a tool for social interaction, not
      merely tools for controlling people and machines in the name of enhancing
      the efficiency of profit-driven enterprises. Ted Nelson may have been an
      outlier, but he spoke to real resentments and dissatisfaction with the
      hierarchical worlds of managers and bureaucrats that characterize so much
      of modern life.</p>
    <p>As a political formula, the romantic libertarianism that the computer
      culture offers as an alternative is as powerful as it is wrong-headed.
      True, in the hands of political hacks like George Gilder, the formula may
      be just an after-the-fact rhetorical trick to justify broader conservative
      social policies. But what the cases of Theodor Nelson or Stewart Brand
      suggest is that, for many, the formula can be deeply compelling. In a
      warped way, it articulates genuine dissatisfaction with existing power
      structures and genuine desires for forms of social life that are less
      hierarchical and more liberating than those offered by the current
      corporate-dominated welfare/warfare state.</p>
    <p>Any politically progressive use of the insights, styles, and
      dissatisfactions that gave birth to the computer culture would have to
      bring out its hidden histories and social constituents. One of the
      liabilities of the colloquial, accessible writing style of the computer
      culture is that it obscures intellectual legacies and context; you have to
      read Gregory Bateson very carefully to notice his debts to Freud and
      social and anthropological theory. It needs to be made clear that the
      pleasant anarchy of the internet is not the just the product of an absence
      of control, but that it was built upon a foundation of support from
      nonprofit research universities and their costly and fragile culture of
      open intellectual exploration. The inanities of corporate managerialism
      that are so deftly criticized by both Ted Nelson and Dilbert need to be
      put in the historical context of the modern corporate form of organization
      and its supports in the legal system such as the fiction of the corporate
      individual.</p>
    <p>More abstractly, I think a compelling alternative form of individualism
      needs to be developed. Nelson&#39;s dream of freedom in computer screens in
      practice devolves into a desire for <i>dis</i>connection, freedom <i>from</i>
      relations with others through illusions like legal neutrality or the
      &#34;technical fix&#34; of the computer itself. This articulates with the
      conventional conservative notion of freedom as purely negative, as freedom
      <i>from</i> , not freedom <i>to. </i>And like that conventional
      conservative idea of freedom, it too easily works to support the corporate
      hierarchies it imagines it will overthrow. For a certain kind of person
      (mostly white, mostly male, mostly educated and middle- and upper-middle
      class), playing with a computer in fact <i>feels</i> like an escape into
      another world, into a kind of freedom. Computer obsession bespeaks, I
      think, a fear of the political, of interconnectedness, a distorted wish to
      escape the unpredictability and unknowability of relations with others
      that comes from being social creatures. That obsession is understandable,
      perhaps, given the limitations of contemporary life; but it&#39;s a shallow
      and ultimately illusory form of freedom. Over the long term, any
      successful left politics will have to address the genuine dissatisfactions
      and desires that make the computer seem like a form of freedom, like an
      escape, but it must do so in a way that leads beyond them in the direction
      of something more situated: a mature version of freedom.</p>

      Printing, August 1975&#34; that starts <i>Dream Machines</i>.) The passage
      predicts that Xerox PARC&#39;s innovations -- those that would lead to the
      creation of the Macintosh less than a decade later -- will lead Xerox to
      dominate the computer field. But are concluded with the following
      prescient paranthetical statement: &#34;The above predictions are based, of
      course, on the assumption of Xerox management knowing what it&#39;s doing.
      Assumptions of this type in the computer field all too often turn out to
      be without basis. But we can hope.&#34;</p>
    <p><a href="#fnB4" name="fn4">[5]</a>In one of many prescient passages,
      Nelson critiques a June 30, 1975 <i>Business Week</i> article on &#34;The
      Office of the Future,&#34; which predicts computerized offices staffed by
      centrally located, specially trained word processing technicians, and that
      the only companies that will succeed in this field will be IBM and Xerox.
      Nelson goes on: &#34;Well, this is hogwash. . . . The office of the future, in
      the opinion of the author, will have nothing to do with the silly
      complexities of automatic typing. It will have screens, and keyboards, and
      possibly a printer for outgoing letters . . . All your business
      information will be callable to the screen instantly. An all-embracing
      data structure will hold every form of information -- numerical and
      textual -- in a cats&#39;-cradle of linkages; and you, the user, whatever your
      job title, may quickly rove your screen through the entire
      information-space you are entitled to see. You will have to do no
      programming.&#34; (<i>Dream Machines</i>, p. &#34;X.&#34;)</p>
