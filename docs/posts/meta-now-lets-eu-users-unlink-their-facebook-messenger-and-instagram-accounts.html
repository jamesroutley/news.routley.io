The changes, set to begin rolling out in the coming weeks, aim to comply with the <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/eus-digital-markets-act-enters-into-force-on-november-1/">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a>.</p>

<p>One key choice users will have is how information is shared between Facebook and Instagram. Instagram and Facebook users will be able to choose whether or not they want information shared between the apps. Those who currently have connected Instagram and Facebook accounts can opt to keep sharing data between the apps or separate their accounts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Information use between Facebook and Instagram: People who have already chosen to connect their Instagram and Facebook accounts will be able to choose either:</p>

<ul>
<li>to continue to connect their accounts through our Accounts Center so that their information will be used across their Instagram and Facebook accounts; or</li>
	<li>to manage their Instagram and Facebook accounts separately so that their information is no longer used across accounts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>Furthermore, Messenger is getting a standalone option. Users can continue using Messenger with their Facebook account or create a new account completely independent of Facebook. This new Messenger account will still offer core features like messaging, chat, and voice/video calls, but without Facebook.</p>

<p>For Facebook Marketplace, the options will be a personalized marketplace experience that taps into Facebook profiles or an anonymized experience where buyers and sellers only communicate via email instead of Messenger.</p>

<p>For gamers, Meta offers a similar choice to Facebook Gaming. Users can keep their Facebook info linked for access to features like multiplayer, in-game purchases, and personalized recommendations. Alternatively, they can opt for a Facebook-free gaming experience.</p>

<p>Finally,<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/meta-confirms-plans-to-offer-ad-free-subscription-plans-for-facebook-and-instagram-in-europe/"> an option introduced in November 2023</a> remains relevant— European users can choose to pay a subscription to Facebook and Instagram ad-free. It ensures that their information is not used for targeted advertising.</p>
