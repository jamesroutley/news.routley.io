			<tr>
				<td>BATTLESHIP</td>
				<td>It started as a simple program for testing functions as two
					dimensional array indexes. Got way out of hand and mutated into full
					blown game pitting you against my attack routines and the awesome
					power of the iSeries.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>BLACKJACK</td>
				<td>Beat the house with this version of 21. Three dimensional
					array indexing function forms the card faces.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>CRIBBAGE</td>
				<td>The most complex non-linear game code ever written for the
					iSeries. Unique hand scoring system shows card sets and point
					values. Robust strategy optimization routines. Â  If you like
					Cribbage, you will be amazed by this game. (darn thing often beats
					me!)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>PYRAMID</td>
				<td>Pyramid variation of Solitaire for the iSeries!. Addictive
					fun. Select all pairs of cards scoring 13 to win. I use this game
					when I am thinking.</td>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td>VIDEOPOKER</td>
				<td>Uses a hash table and the random number API to sort a deck
					of cards. Also uses the concept of implicitly defined arrays as DS
					subfields of defined arrays.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><a>TICTACTOE</a></td>
				<td>2d array indexing example.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>YAHTZEE</td>
				<td>Classic dice game</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>MINE SWEEPER</td>
				<td>If you are not careful, BUMM! A game by Tibor Erdos in
					Hungary. Notice the cool F9 button that lets you switch between
					English and Magyar.</td>
			</tr>

	</p><p>My best Pyramid game ever. Notice the &#39;Cards in Deck&#39; = 16. This
		means I only had to turn up one card to complete the Pyramid! If you
		ever win a game with out turning up any cards, send me a screen shot
		and I will post it here.</p></div>
