    <h1>Week 4: Self-Reliance</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>Over the last week, </span><strong>I got some coding work done</strong><span> (and had a lot of great interactions with Recursers, as always!) but I realized that </span><strong>toning down my social appearances wasn‚Äôt quite enough to get me where I wanted to be, coding-speed-wise</strong><span>. To copy from my checkin on Zulip last Friday:</span></p><p><span>‚ÄúAt this point, I feel like I probably need to work alone more often in order to make faster progress on my coding. I think it&#39;s important to pair some, because I treasure basically every personal interaction and pairing that I&#39;ve had here so far, but I&#39;m a slow coder already, and it seems like balancing pairing with getting some good forward coding progress is important. So </span><strong>I&#39;ll try one pairing a day next week and see how that goes</strong><span>.‚Äù</span></p><p><span>Which I‚Äôve tried over the last couple of days, and </span><strong>it </strong><em><strong>is</strong></em><strong> working better so far</strong><span>! I‚Äôm getting more code done by working by myself sometimes. So I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic this might be the right balance.</span></p><p><strong>Are Elixir and Phoenix still a good fit?</strong><span> I learned an important lesson last week, actually: </span><strong>Phoenix shares a lot of similarities with Ruby on Rails</strong><span>. This makes sense if you know some of the </span><a href="https://fly.io/blog/how-we-got-to-liveview/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">history with Chris McCord</a><span>, the creator of Phoenix. I think a lot of the missing pieces for me mentally (which I think aren‚Äôt always well-covered in the Phoenix documentation) slotted into place when a fellow Recurser (thanks so much Russell!) told me this thing and outlined a lot of the similarities.</span></p><p><span>As a result, Russell also encouraged me to look at Phoenix‚Äôs </span><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">code generation</a><span> to simplify my Phoenix development and make my app a more idiomatic Phoenix app. (He was able to identify the codegen‚Äôs usefulness due, again, to many similarities it apparently shares with similar functionality with Ruby on Rails.) So now </span><strong>I‚Äôm going to take his awesome advice and learn on my own for a bit about these awesome codegen tools</strong><span>! Which means I‚Äôm continuing to put my strategy into place. üôÇ And </span><strong>this knowledge makes me feel a lot better about Phoenix</strong><span>, too.</span></p><p><span>Finally, </span><strong>I just wanted to mention a random awesome website</strong><span> I got last week from another Recurser: </span><a href="http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2958" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">a monad tutorial for people who have read too many monad tutorials</a><span>. After a lot of years of struggling to understand monads, THIS was finally the piece of writing that got them to click my mind. And it did that by shaking an awful lot of confused thinking out of my brain. When I say that the Recurse Center has helped me in some unexpected and awesome ways, this is the kind of thing I mean!</span></p><p><strong>Next week I hope to have some cool codegen knowledge to share, as well as some additional functionality that that codegen helps me build</strong><span>! But I‚Äôm getting my second COVID booster in a couple of days, which may slow me down a bit. </span><strong>I‚Äôll try to be kind to myself if it knocks me for a loop</strong><span> like I‚Äôve seen it do with a few other people already. See you next week!</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
