<p><span>29 Mar 2024</span></p><p>This blog post is part of a series on file formats research. See <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2023/08/04/researching-file-formats-library-of-congress-sustainability-of-digital-formats/">this introduction post</a> for more information.</p>

<p>After a handful of difficult and technically (or socially/politically) complex formats, it was nice to work on this simple (if unspecified) format, taking me back to one of the earliest formats I worked on, <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2023/08/11/researching-file-formats-1-fasta-database-format/">FASTA</a>. This format originally belonged in that initial category (see <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2023/09/08/researching-file-formats-5-radiance-rgbe-image-format/">RGBE Image Format</a>), but there was a mix-up. While it is structurally similar to FASTA, it is a 3D format and has the same <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd_explanation.shtml#factors">quality and functionality factors</a> as the rest of this set.</p>

<p>This format simply stores point clouds (a way to articulate geographic shapes) aligned with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system">Cartesian coordinate system</a>, which is, as the format name implies, X, Y, Z.</p>

<p>The format starts with a comment (represented by a # and the text), and then coordinates separated by spaces, with new lines for each next point. That’s it! That’s the format.</p>

<p>There’s also some variations that include adding color, so those follow the syntax of <code>X Y Z R G B</code>!</p>

<p>At the same time, while this format was simple, it also poses a challenge of not being officially documented in many places, as noted in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41267210/point-cloud-xyz-format-specification">stackoverflow post</a> stating that there are no official docs. Anyway, more to come on that when the official FDD is published.</p>

<p>Disambiguation: This format was set to cover the one I’m describing above, but there’s another format that is a text-based simple data format also called XYZ, used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_file_format">storing chemicals</a>. That one is described <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/xyz.html">here</a>.</p>
