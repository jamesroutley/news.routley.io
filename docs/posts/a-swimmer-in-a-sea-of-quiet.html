    <p>You headed out in the sunshine between the days of grey to be along the river, to soak in the warmth, to take in the bounty of the solar system.</p>
<p>As you head towards the valley, to the river, from the hilltop, you start to realize that there is a thickness forming, there is a skirt in the distance along the coastal range – there is a density diffusing the very light that you seek.</p>
<p>Do you pause? Do you turn around? Do you hold steadfast in your quest for warmth and light?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You breathe and feel the thickness.</p>
<p>You feel the cold.</p>
<p>You continue to the river.</p>
<p>You find yourself in a viscous mist with the tops of ancient poplars nearly touching the blue, but out of reach.</p>
<p>You become a swimmer in a sea of quiet. Another world has taken you into its depths. The colors, the light, the presence – focus something within.</p>
<p>A light from another existence peeks through in ephemeral fade-in/fade-out transformations. It is your sun and not your sun, for it shows you herself in a softer, cooler, yet more defined and sharper locus of points around a center of being.</p>
<p>A field is transformed in color, in shape, in stillness – the mist moving tendrils through its openness to create soft structure – calling you to pause.</p>
<p>Eventually, you become saturated with the cold and otherworldliness. The motions of quiet birds, the budding January branches, the slowly revealing path are left behind, and you find yourself emerging from a dream.</p>
