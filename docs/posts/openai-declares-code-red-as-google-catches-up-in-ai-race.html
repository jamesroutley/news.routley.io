    <h1>OpenAI declares &#39;code red&#39; as Google catches up in AI race</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The tides are turning in the AI race, and the pressure is getting to OpenAI. Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” on Monday, urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT, an indicator that the startup’s once-unassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in.</p><p>In the memo, reported by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-altman-declares-code-red-to-improve-chatgpt-as-google-threatens-ai-lead-7faf5ea6?mod=rss_Technology"><em>Wall Street Journal</em> </a>and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-ceo-declares-code-red-combat-threats-chatgpt-delays-ads-effort"><em>The Information</em></a>, Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads, shopping and health agents, and a personal assistant, Pulse, to focus on improving ChatGPT. This includes core features like greater speed and reliability, better personalization, and the ability to answer more questions, he said.</p><p>There will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot, the memo said, and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development.</p><p>The newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability. It is also something of a full-circle moment in the AI race. Google, which <a href="http://iafisher.com/2023/5/12/23721037/google-ai-progress-search-docs-starline-video-calls">declared its own “code red”</a> after the arrival of ChatGPT, is a particular concern. Google’s AI user base is growing — helped by the success of popular tools like the <a href="http://iafisher.com/report/826003/googles-nano-banana-pro-generates-excellent-conspiracy-fuel">Nano Banana image model</a> — and its latest<a href="http://iafisher.com/report/827555/google-gemini-3-is-winning-the-ai-race-for-now"> AI model, Gemini 3</a>, blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NzY5ODkx"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Robert Hart</span></span></span></li><li><div id="follow-category-article_footer-dmcyOmNhdGVnb3J5OjEwMg=="></div></li><li><div id="follow-category-article_footer-dmcyOmNhdGVnb3J5OjEwMQ=="></div></li><li><div id="follow-category-article_footer-dmcyOmNhdGVnb3J5OjYz"></div></li><li><div id="follow-category-article_footer-dmcyOmNhdGVnb3J5OjU4"></div></li></ul></div></div></div>
