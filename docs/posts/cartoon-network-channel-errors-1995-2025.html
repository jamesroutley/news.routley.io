The error was then fixed, only for it to happen again 9 seconds later. The error then happened on and off until 1:35 into the show, after which it faded into the Checkerboard Technical Difficulties slide. After 18 seconds, the slide disappeared and the show returned.

<td>The <i>ThunderCats</i> episode <b>Fond Memories</b> encountered substantial technical difficulties. Following the show&#39;s custom Toonami intro was just under a minute of blank screen followed by the QTTV Technical Difficulties slide. The slide abruptly cuts to the first act already in process as Mumm-Ra is explaining his plan to trap Lion-O, accompanied by the TV-Y7-FV ratings bug fading in and out. The following establishing shot of Mumm-Ra walking through a cave was then interrupted by a Toonami ThunderCats bumper, followed by the commercial break playing ahead of schedule. After the commercial break ends and a few seconds of blank screen followed by a brief gray screen, the episode starts again, halfway through its title card / credits. The episode then aired properly, albeit with about five seconds of black and gray screens preceding each act of the episode (including the epilogue), and the commercial break being replaced with a Toonami bumper. The screenbug was completely absent for the entirety of the episode.

Right after it ends, a Powerhouse bumper introducing the show plays, only for it to abruptly fade out midway through. Lastly, the screenbug is not present throughout the entire duration of the episode.

<td>Typically, during Season 2 episodes of <i>Hamtaro</i>, Cartoon Network would replace the second theme song (&#34;H-A-M-T-A-R-O&#34;) with the first (&#34;It&#39;s Hamtaro Time&#34;). However, during the premieres of <b>The Little Bandits!</b> and <b>Clubhouse Intruders</b>, both openings are used. This also occurs in the airing of <b>Happy Birthday Hamtaro Special!</b>, likely because the master of the special episode began with a title card before cutting to the second theme song, so Cartoon Network simply began with the first instead of replacing the theme song.

<td>The 7:00pm episode of <i>Naruto</i> had significant technical issues after the first break. Midway through the episode, the episode had a tape error, eventually cutting to the Cartoon Network fence slide. The intro restarted after a minute before cutting again to the fence before cutting back into the episode in progress. Approximately five minutes of episode time was cut due to the difficulties. The screenbug also disappears during the first act of the following episode, which also ended ten minutes early. No commercials aired during for the following hour except for those locally inserted by the provider, instead cutting to the fence, For the remainder of the night, the marathon aired twenty minutes ahead of schedule, allowing the network to squeeze in another episode, which aired commercial free.

<td>The 4:00pm airing of <i>Naruto</i> started midway through the episode <b>A Feeling of Yearning, a Flower Full of Hope</b>, only for the tape to rewind to the beginning a minute later, cutting to the fence card and skipping the intro entirely. Like last night, commercials were skipped in favor of the technical difficulties card for this episode only and the screenbug disappeared for 10 minutes after the error.
<p>The first commercial break of Naruto&#39;s 10:30pm airing is entirely skipped, possibly to save time.
