    <h1>In Obscurity</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I recently read this remarkable anecdote about Isaac Newton in the refereshingly
irreverent <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em> by Bill Bryson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a student, frustrated by the limitations of conventional mathematics, he
[Newton] invented an entirely new form, the calculus, but then told no one
about it for <strong>twenty-seven years</strong>. In like manner, he did work in optics
that transformed our understanding of light and laid the foundation for the
science of spectroscopy, and again chose not to share the results for three
decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine. Twenty-seven years! That’s an incomprehensible level of reticence
in an era in which people can’t eat a sandwich, let alone invent Calculus,
without tweeting about it. I tweet, therefore I am.</p>
<p>That got me thinking about other creatives who withheld the fruits of their
labor from the world at large.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kafka left his work, both published and unpublished, to his friend and
literary executor, Max Brod, with explicit instructions that it should be
destroyed on Kafka’s death; Kafka wrote: “Dearest Max, my last request:
Everything I leave behind me … in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters
(my own and others’), sketches, and so on, is to be burned unread.&#34; Brod
ignored this request and published the novels and collected works between 1925
and 1935.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No one–<em>no one</em>–would know about Franz Kafka if Max Brod did not defy his
dying wishes.</p>
<p>Then there’s Henry Darger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…an American writer, novelist and artist who worked as a hospital custodian
in Chicago, Illinois. He has become famous for his posthumously discovered
<strong>15,145</strong>-page fantasy novel manuscript called <em>The Story of the Vivian
Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the
Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion</em>, along
with several hundred drawings and watercolor illustrations for the story.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>His work belongs to a category of obscure, and often post-humously discovered,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art">outsider art</a>.</p>
<p>I wonder to what extent instantaneous “publication” has adversely impacted our
ability to work on something, in obscurity, <em>for it’s own sake</em>.</p>
<p>What would you create <em>even if no one ever saw it</em>?</p>
<p>That’s an interesting, clarifying question isn’t it?</p>
<p>I’m troubled by my inability to answer it.</p>
<p>Newton, Kafka, and Darger certainly could.</p>
