    <p>Ferrocene is an open source qualified Rust compiler toolchain. With this, Ferrous Systems invested its decade of Rust experience to make Rust a first-class language for mission-critical and functional safety systems.</p>

    <p>For its first release, Ferrocene 23.06 is a ISO 26262 (ASIL D) and IEC 61508 (SIL 4) qualified version of the existing open-source compiler, rustc, based on Rust 1.68.</p>

    <p>We plan to work on standards like DO-178C, ISO 21434, and IEC 62278 in the future.</p>
  </section>

  <h3 id="open-source">Open source</h3>

  <p>The source code of Ferrocene is fully open source under the <code>MIT OR Apache-2.0</code> license, including the full qualification documents. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/ferrocene/ferrocene"><code>ferrocene/ferrocene</code> repository on GitHub</a> and our <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/ferrocene-open-source/">&#34;Open Sourcing Ferrocene&#34; blog post</a>.

  </p><h3 id="availability">Available for Purchase Later This Year</h3>

  <p>Ferrocene will be available for purchase by individuals and companies later this year at €25 per month per seat (or €240 per seat if paying annually). Purchasing Ferrocene will grant you access to the pre-built binaries and packages of our qualified compilers, and the rendered qualification documents for all versions of Ferrocene.</p>

  <p>Early access is available right now for organizations with more than 10 users: <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/contact#ferrocene">contact us</a> if you&#39;re interested.</p>

  <p>Support plans, and Ferrous Systems&#39; digital signatures of the qualification documents (to present to the assessors when certifying your projects), are going to be available separately. <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/contact#ferrocene">Contact us</a> for more information!</p>



  <h3 id="never-losing-upstream">Long-Term Support while never losing upstream</h3>

  <p>Rust moves fast. Ferrocene allows you to pick your pace by never losing upstream itself, while supporting older versions to your needs. We ship all available Rust compilers for all your needs.</p>

  <h3 id="supply-chain">Supply Chain Security</h3>

  <p>Ferrocene goes beyond the compiler in keeping all aspects of the software being built in mind, particularly the distribution, traceability and use of own or foreign libraries.</p>
 
  <p>We’re committed to providing secure, auditable distribution channels for these toolchain updates. Active communication of issues to clients and helping with fixes rounds up the package.</p>

  <h3 id="compatible">Compatible</h3>

  <p>Ferrocene is committed to strong compatibility with the Rust project&#39;s Rust distribution: check out our <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/qualifying-rust-without-forking">&#34;Qualifying Rust without forking&#34; blog post</a> to learn more.</p>

  

  <p>The Ferrocene project acts as a beacon and gathering place for mission and safety-critical concerns in the Rust project. This includes strong testing of the very core of the language on a number of specialized platforms. We’re creating a developer representation and raising the visibility of these industries in the Rust ecosystem.
     As a downstream of the <a href="https://rust-lang.org">main Rust project</a>, we see it as a force multiplier.</p>
