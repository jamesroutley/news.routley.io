    <h1>No More Stories</h1>

  <p>This is a bit of a rant, and it&#39;s about a topic that I’m not an expert on, but
I do feel strongly about.  So, despite the forceful language, please read this
knowing that there’s still a fair amount of epistemic humility behind what I’m
saying and I’m definitely open to updating my opinion if an expert on
journalism or public policy were to have some compelling reason for the
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Chesterton%27s_fence">Chestertonian fence</a> of
the structure of journalistic institutions.  Comments sections are the devil’s
playground so I don’t have one, but <a href="mailto:stories-blog-172844@glyph.im">feel free to reach
out</a> and if we have a fruitful discussion
I’m happy to publish it here.</p>
<p>One of the things that COVID has taught me is that the concept of a “story” in
the news media is a relic that needs to be completely re-thought.  It is not
suited to the challenges of media communication today.</p>
<p>Specifically, there are challenging and complex public-policy questions which
require robust engagement from an informed electorate<sup id="fnref:1:no-more-stories-2021-12"><a href="#fn:1:no-more-stories-2021-12" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup>.  These questions are
open-ended and their answers are unclear.  What’s an appropriate strategy for
public safety, for example?  Should policing be part of it?  I have my
preferred snappy slogans in these areas but if we want to step away from
propaganda for a moment and focus on governance, this is actually a really
difficult question that hinges on a ton of difficult-to-source data.</p>
<p>For most of history, facts were scarce.  It was the journalist’s job to find
facts, to write them down, and to circulate them to as many people as possible,
so that the public discourse could at least be fact-based; to have <em>some</em> basis
in objective reality.</p>
<p>In the era of the Internet, though, we are <em>drowning</em> in facts.  We don&#39;t just
have facts, we have data.  We don&#39;t just have data, we have metadata; we have
databases and data warehouses and data lakes and all manner of data containers
in between.  These data do not coalesce into information on their own, however.
They need to be collected, collated, synthesized, and interpreted.</p>
<p>Thus was born the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_journalism">Data
Journalism</a>.  No longer is it
the function of the journalist simply to <em>report</em> the facts; in order for the
discussion to be usefully grounded, they must also <em>aggregate</em> the facts, and
present their aggregation in a way that can be comprehended.</p>
<p>Data journalism is definitely a step up, and there are many excellent
data-journalism projects that have been done.  But the problem with these
projects is that they are often individual data-journalism <em>stories</em> that give
a temporal snapshot of one journalist&#39;s interpretation of an issue.  Just a
tidy little pile of motivated reasoning with a few cherry-picked citations, and
then we move on to the next story.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s when we even get data journalism.  <em>Most</em> journalism is still just
isolated stories, presented as prose.  But this sort of story-after-story
presentation in most publications provides a misleading picture of the
world. Beyond even the sample bias of what kinds of stories get clicks and can
move ad inventory, this sequential chain of disconnected facts is extremely
prone to cherry-picking by bad-faith propagandists, and even much less
malicious problems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias">recency
bias</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic">availability
heuristic</a>.</p>
<p>Trying to develop a robust understanding of complex public policy issues by
looking at individual news stories is like trying to map a continent&#39;s
coastline by examining individual grains of sand one at a time.</p>
<p>What we need from journalism for the 21st century is a curated set of ongoing
<em>collections of consensus</em>.  What the best strategy is to combat COVID might
change over time.  Do mask mandates work?  You can&#39;t possibly answer that
question by scrounging around on pubmed by yourself, or worse yet reading a
jumbled stream of op-ed thinkpieces in the New York Times and the Washington
Post.</p>
<p>During COVID, some major press institutions started caving to the fairly
<em>desperate</em> need for this sort of structure by setting up &#34;trackers&#34; for COVID
vaccinations, case counts, and so on.  But these trackers are still fit
awkwardly within the &#34;story&#34; narrative.  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?state=US">This
one</a>
from the Washington post is a “story” from 2020, but has data from December
16th, 2021.</p>
<p>These trackers monitor only a few stats though, and don’t provide much in the
way of meta-commentary on pressing questions: do masks work? Do lockdowns work?
How much do we know about the efficacy of various ventilation improvements?</p>
<p>Each journalistic institution should maintain a “tracker” for every issue of
public concern, and ideally they’d be in conversation with each other,
constantly curating their list of sources in real time, updating conclusions as
new data arrives, and recording an ongoing tally of what we can really be
certain about and what is still a legitimate controversy.<sup id="fnref:2:no-more-stories-2021-12"><a href="#fn:2:no-more-stories-2021-12" id="fnref:2">2</a></sup></p>
