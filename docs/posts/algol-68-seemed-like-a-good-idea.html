<p>The 1960s saw rapid growth in programming languages, which was both good and bad. The first (commercial) languages appeared in the late 1950s, in the guise of Fortran, and Cobol, which were very successful. Work on Algol started in 1958, it was to be a scientific programming language, providing features that Fortran just didn’t, e.g. better structured control, in a package that had roughly the same scope as Fortran, i.e. numerical computation. Algol-58 didn’t really get too far, with emphasis shifting to Algol-60 first implemented by 1960. Algol-60 had a lot going for it, but it seemingly wasn’t enough for the group that produced the 1962 revision of Algol-60. Working Group 2.1 of IFIP wanted a more universal language, one whose scope could include areas covered by Cobol and Lisp, and so they set about extending the language into Algol-X, what would become Algol-68. But Algol-68 wasn’t really a new version of Algol, it was a whole new language. A very complex, and intriguing language, perhaps ahead of its time, perhaps too obscure.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The best we could do was to send with it a minority report, stating our considered view that, ” . . . as a tool for the reliable creation of sophisticated programs, the language was a failure.”</p>
<cite>C.A.R. Hoare, The Emperor’s Old Clothes (CACM , 1981)</cite></blockquote>



<p>In December 1968 the working group adopted the proposal by Dutch computer scientist Adriaan van Wijngaarden. But the draft proposal for Algol-68 was opposed by some members of the committee. In the <em><a href="https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/ALGOL/report/Algol68_revised_report-AB-600dpi.pdf">Revised Report of the Algorithmic Language ALGOL-68</a></em> (ALGOL Bulletin), the authors acknowledged the “wholehearted cooperation, support, interest, <strong>criticism</strong> and <strong>violent objections</strong> from members of WG 2.1″, which may sum up how committee members really felt. Both Hoare and Dijkstra were critical about abandoning the simplicity of Algol-60, the new language becoming a vehicle for complex ideas. That was only half of it – even after being specified it seems that it was a hard language for which to implement a compiler. Algol-68 was a language written for programmers (albeit academic programmers), not for compiler writers. </p>



<p>In the 1960s a lot of effort was put into the formal definition of languages, with little effort put into creating languages that could be used in a practical manner, or for teaching programming. It seems like many in the fledgling CS community wanted to build languages based on academic ideals, rather than anything useful. Niklaus Wirth was a long time subscriber of the quest to build ALGOL-68, but realized its shortcomings early on. He considered the working group too rigid and ineffective, and not open to suggestions from others. Wirth alluded to an alternative, but “<em>It would have required the renunciation of the immodest ambition to erect another monument or mile stone along the road of progress in computer sciences. It would have required a shift from a fanatic perfectionism in formal definition methods towards honest consideration of pragmatics.</em>“. Wirth and Hoare would spin off their draft proposal for Algol-X into Algol-W, a simple extension of Algol-60 which would ultimately form the basis of Pascal.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Wirth recognized Algol 68 for what it was, a catastrophe.”</p>
<cite>Bertrand Meyer, “<a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/niklaus-wirth-or-the-importance-of-being-simple/">Niklaus Wirth, or the Importance of Being Simple</a>“, CACM (Jan.9, 2024)</cite></blockquote>



<p>The first Algol-68 compiler appeared in 1970, Algol-68R (initially written in Algol-60), implemented by the Royal Radar Establishment (UK). But it was based on a subset of the original language, with modifications such as loops not ending with <code>OD</code>. It seems to have been popular in the UK, used for teaching programming in the 1970s. While there were other implementations, the language didn’t really make inroads into the programming community. Arguably Wirth’s Algol-W was a better successor to Algol-60. The committee did spend a number of years trying to refine Algol-68, however Hoare recollecting the development of Algol-68 in <em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358549.358561">The Emperor’s Old Clothes</a></em>, still felt that the improvements were too conservative, “… in my view it does not remove the basic technical flaws in the design, nor does it begin to address the problem of its overwhelming complexity.”</p>



<p>The Algol family of languages was firmly rooted in the academic community, and arguably did not have the same connections to industry as the likes of Fortran and Cobol. Industry did not adopt Algol-68, IBM did not support it (it was arguably the largest manufacturer of mainframes in the 1960s, into the 70s). Algol-68 also had to compete against languages with a smaller language footprint, such as Pascal and C. In reality there has never really been a universal programming language, it is likely a fallacy of academia. Algol-68 was not a success, not as a commercial language, and not as a teaching language. Part of the problem with Algol-68 may have stemmed from having “too many cooks in the kitchen”, at a time when programming language design was still a fledgling craft (IFIP Working Group 2.1 supposedly had about 28 members). </p>



<p>Algol-68 (or derivatives of) did rise to some prominence in one place – the USSR. The most prominent implementation of the language came from Leningrad State University. It was apparently used to design Russian telephone exchanges.</p>
