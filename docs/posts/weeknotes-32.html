    <ul>
<li>starting a newsletter over on <a href="https://buttondown.com/">buttondown</a> as enough people were encouraging <a href="https://olu.online/weeknotes-31">last week</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://buttondown.com/oluonline">sign up?</a> for newsletters? sire?</li>
<li>i feel bad moving my old list from substack but it seems to be what everyone else does? i&#39;m assuaging my guilt by remembering everyone will probably unsubscribe anyway if they are tired of me and my rubbish, and thinking of useful takeaways or actions from each email.</li>
<li>assuage is a cool word</li>
<li>which reminds me, i really love <a href="https://carefulwords.com/">careful words</a> which is like a thesaurus but more so... not all the words are directly related but they all have related vibes. really helped with choosing my word of the year (greathearted) and quarter (forment).</li>
<li>gradually re-committing to the idea that honestly, you have to draw your own lines in the sand when it comes to moral action. you can&#39;t boycott every evil thing without running off into the woods, which you are also not free to do for very long (or even at all depending on your country&#39;s equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam">freedom to roam</a>, and has mixed efficacy too depending on your goal!</li>
<li>it&#39;s my birthday month!!!!!!!! march is so great.</li>
<li>been reading thinking in bets - &#34;life is like poker, not chess&#34; - and so far the main thing i&#39;ve taken away is being more upfront about how sure i am of things as praxis.</li>
<li>looking for more writing and speaking opportunities so let me know if you hear of anything okay? if you&#39;re a techie a friend sent me <a href="https://nostarch.com/writeforus">no starch press&#39; open call</a>, don&#39;t say i never give you anything.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danyella5000/video/7472111260339834143?lang=en">everyone just wants to be seen aka &#39;girls just want one thing: to be described&#39;</a></li>
<li>this week i&#39;ve been enjoying boneless jerk chicken, peppers stuffed with freekeh, cous and all manner of other veggies, biscuits of any brand which are a crisp biscuit with a slab of chocolate on top, and soft mints/mentos.</li>
<li>i started reading the transgender issue by shon faye and loved what i have read so much but the library/libby app snatched it back, might have to buy a copy of that and her latest book on love, along with all the books by people i know that came out recently!! the books are: before we hit the ground by selali fiamanya; model home by rivers solomon; thank you for calling the lesbian line by elizabeth lovatt; poor artists by gabrielle de la puente and zarina muhammad; and slugs: a manifesto by abi palmer. will have to pace myself, books are expensive!</li>
<li>where do people buy their ebooks, if not from amazon?</li>
