      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Arguable the goals of DevOps align partly with the goals of system administrators in former days: Provide reliable compute infrastructure for<pre><code>  1) internal users: mainly developers by providing CI/CD
  2) external users: end users
</code></pre>
Nowadays we call people that do 1) DevOps and people that do 2) SREs (so one could argue that the role of sys admins just got more specialized).<p>The platform of choice is mostly Kubernetes these days, which promises among other things stuff like</p><pre><code>  - load balancing
  - self-healing
  - rollbacks/rollouts
  - config management
</code></pre>
Before the cloud days, this stuff has been implemented using a conglomerate of different software and shell scripts, issued at dedicated &#34;pet&#34; servers.<p>In particular, a main critic is &#34;state&#34; and the possibility to change that state by e.g. messing with config files via SSH, which makes running and maintaining these servers more error-prone.</p><p>However, my main question is:</p><p>&#34;If this old way of doing things is so error-prone, and it&#39;s easier to use declarative solutions like Kubernetes, why does the solution seem to need sooo much work that the role of DevOps seems to dominate IT related job boards? Shouldn&#39;t Kubernetes <i>reduce</i> the workload and need <i>less</i> men power?&#34;</p><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, the old way does indeed look messy, I am just wondering why there is a need for so much dev ops nowadays ...</p><p>Thanks for your answers.</p></td></tr>
