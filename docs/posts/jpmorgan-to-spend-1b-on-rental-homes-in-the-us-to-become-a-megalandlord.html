                        <p>A new joint venture between one of America&#39;s largest banks and a growing build-to-rent operator is the latest sign that big investors are undeterred by the volatile real estate market. </p><p>Haven Realty Capital and JPMorgan Chase&#39;s asset management arm said they will invest up to $1 billion to develop build-to-rent single-family homes across the country, according to a November 15 announcement. </p><p>The duo plans to seed their investment with up to $415 million in equity. The first installment will include a purchase of 250 homes in three communities around the Atlanta metropolitan area, and the deal could close within the next 90 days, the statement said. </p><p>The partnership comes at a time when demand for new housing continues to slide, <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">according to data from the Census Bureau</a>. Meanwhile, the National Association of Homebuilders <a href="https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/housing-economics/indices/housing-market-index" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">reports</a> that <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/interestrates/u-s-homebuilder-confidence-decreases-for-eleventh-straight-month-in-november-1031919221" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">builder confidence is at its lowest level </a>since 2012 because of rising interest rates and construction material costs. </p>
                        
                        <p>&#34;The for-sale housing market has been significantly hampered by recession fears, inflation and rising interest rates placing a burden on homebuilders and their ability to add to the housing stock,&#34; Haven&#39;s founder Sudha Reddy said in the statement, adding that the partnership will allow the company to work with homebuilders who &#34;are becoming increasingly comfortable selling entire communities to operators&#34; like Haven.</p><h2>Build-to-rent is a &#39;useful response to the market&#39;s needs&#39;</h2><p>The build-to-rent trend initially emerged during the Great Recession as a way for homebuilders to continue adding supply at a time when consumers were not buying homes. It refers to a process where developers construct an entire community of typically detached single-family homes that are later rented out by an operating partner.</p><p>The trend gained steam during the COVID-19 pandemic as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-gen-z-leaving-cities-for-suburbs-amid-pandemic-2020-11" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">demand for single-family homes and suburban living skyrocketed</a>.  </p><p>Haven Realty has emerged as a national leader in the space, with a portfolio of 35 build-to-rent communities valued at more than $1.2 billion. Similarly, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/proptech-startups-reward-renters-with-cash-gift-cards-home-equity-2022-10" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">JPMorgan is one of a handful of companies that are pioneering digital rent payment options</a> for renters and landlords. </p>
                        
                        <p>Institutional investors like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fundrise-crowdfunding-real-estate-private-equity-overpaying-homes-build-to-rent" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">Fundrise</a> as well as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-single-family-rental-build-to-rent-houses-finance-2021-7" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">pension funds, and public companies have been steadily acquiring single-family homes</a> to rent for a profit. This has only increased competition for homes at a time when <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/both-red-and-blue-cities-are-voting-in-favor-of-affordable-housing-2022-11" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">housing affordability is a primary concern for many</a>. </p><p>However, some, like Tomasz Piskorski, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School, believe that the build-to-rent model is more efficient than the traditional model of selling each newly built home to separate private individual buyers.</p><p>He told Insider in early November that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-housing-market-experts-institutional-investors-crowdfunding-platforms-fundrise-2022-11" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">the build-to-rent trend is a &#34;useful response to the market&#39;s needs.&#34;</a></p><p>&#34;Professional rental companies in some ways bring more efficiency and they might help solve affordability problems because of very high mortgage rates right now,&#34; Piskorski said. &#34;A lot of people simply cannot afford to buy a home.&#34;</p>
                        
                        <p>Not everybody agrees with Piskorski&#39;s assessment.</p><p>Housing experts like John Burns, of the eponymous real estate consulting firm in Phoenix, Arizona, have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/expert-warns-investors-too-much-rental-housing-being-built-phoenix-2022-3" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">cautioned developers against going &#34;all-in&#34; on build-to-rent</a> because it can take a long time to bring those communities to market. </p><p>&#34;We&#39;re still very bullish overall, but not everything&#39;s going to work out,&#34; Burns <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/expert-warns-investors-too-much-rental-housing-being-built-phoenix-2022-3" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">told Insider</a> in October. </p>
