    <h1>Put it on the crazy pile: Ideas and creativity</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Being an academic, I am (sort of) being paid<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to come up with
new ideas about my research field, potential applications, and the
future. When I was just starting out, one of my fears was that I would
not be able to come up with sufficiently good ideas. All my professors
had these great ideas—would I ever be at their level?</p>
<p>Somewhat unsurprisingly, ideation is not something that we are often
being taught in academia—and some late-night conversations with my
colleagues, held in hushed voices, and behind closed doors, lead me to
suspect that my personal reservations about being up to the task of
‘proper’ ideation might be more widespread.</p>
<p>In any case, I tried to address my fears by creating a support system.
I figured that it would be a good idea to keep track of my ideas in
order to see whether any specific trends emerged. Lo and behold, my
my <code>Ideas.md</code> file was born! As you might expect from the file
extension, this is really just a Markdown file without any specific
sectioning. Whenever I had an idea, it went in there; just a few lines,
appended to be top of the file. I reckoned that after a few months,
I would probably have a bunch of good ideas in there.</p>
<p>What I did not anticipate was how <em>freeing the whole
experience turned out to be!</em> With the existence of <code>Ideas.md</code>,
suddenly, I had ‘external storage,’ and for some unfathomable reason, my
brain, abhorring a vacuum, started coming up with more ideas.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
Arguably, most of these ideas are probably<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> not great to begin with,
but the way I set up <code>Ideas.md</code> was tailored to prevent exactly the
spur-of-the-moment judgement that I might regret later.
I instead set aside a 15 minutes every month or so to go through the file,
with the intent of deleting ideas that appear to ludicrous.</p>
<p>Following this regimen over the years has led to astonishing and
unexpected results, though:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I was able to synthesise a suitable research agenda from some
seemingly-disconnected ideas. By revisiting the ideas after some time
had passed, I was often able to express them better or even, in case
of research ideas, formulate a good ‘plan of attack.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jotting down ideas right when they occurred lowered my mental burden
considerably since they stopped rattling around in my marble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always have a new project idea ready; it might not be the <em>precise</em>
thing that one sets out to do, but it serves as a good scientific
conversation starter, in my opinion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Why this technique works for me is probably due to the fact that
I prefer finishing strands of thoughts before jumping to something else.
Being able to <em>ignore</em> the siren song of a new shiny idea keeps me
focused. I also like to know that my data are safe, and relying on the
storage capabilities of my own mind seems too restrictive. Hence, having
a single file that I can edit in any editor is exactly the right amount
of structure for me; it is always accessible and does not require a lot
of additional mental resources.</p>
<p>Over the years, my confidence in <code>Ideas.md</code> has steadily increased, and
I am more than happy to keep even the craziest ideas in there. In case
you are wondering: those crazy ideas come mostly in the form of
associations between seemingly-unrelated concepts. I often wonder about
the connections between different mathematical concepts, for instance.
Recently, while having a discussion with
<a href="https://ernstroell.github.io">Ernst</a>, one of my awesome Ph.D. students,
I framed some of these ideas as being ‘crazy.’ At some point in our talk,
when we were coming up with other ideas, he improved upon this
terminology and said ‘Ah, put it on your
crazy pile.’</p>
<p>So, in the end, that might be an apt description of <code>Ideas.md</code>: my own
personal crazy pile! You may want to choose another name, of course,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
but make sure to create your own crazy pile today, and you will be
surprised about the benefits in the future!</p>
