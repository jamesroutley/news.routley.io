    <h1>Turds in AI Generated Art</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you noticed the turds?</p>

<p>Before I begin, let me say that I’m not dissing
<a href="https://blog.luden.io/generated-adventure-the-postmortem-of-a-game-made-with-chatgpt-and-midjourney-prompts-included-f87e7e615204">Generated Adventure</a>
or the people who created it.  They made a very impressive tech demo in
72 hours, and if you don’t look too closely, it’s rather pretty.  They
were under tight time pressure, and they were specifically aiming to
use only AI tools.  They did better than I would have in 72 hours
(although as a parent, the idea of devoting 72 straight hours to
anything is totally unimaginable).  It’s good enough to make me
consider Deform over Godot for a project like this (I’m sure either
could handle it, but they did it so fast!).</p>

<p>But I feel like something that gets lost in the discussion of
AI-generated artwork is the turds.  Here’s an example of what I mean:
it’s one of the sets of images that Midjourney generated for Generated
Adventure (I don’t think any of them ended up being used for the game).</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/turds-orig.png" alt="Four AI-generated isometric view of bedrooms in a fantasy game style" id="fourai-generatedisometricviewofbedroomsinafantasygamestyle"/></p>

<p>At first glance, it’s fine.  But then you notice the turds.</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/turds.png" alt="The above image, marked up with colors indicating the problems; there are dozens of markings" id="theaboveimagemarkedupwithcolorsindicatingtheproblemstherearedozensofmarkings"/></p>

<p>Here’s what I mean.  Green marks blurry object edges, which I’ve
complained about before.  Some of these might be the webp compression
of the image from the <a href="https://blog.luden.io/generated-adventure-the-postmortem-of-a-game-made-with-chatgpt-and-midjourney-prompts-included-f87e7e615204">Medium
post</a>,
so I haven’t been too harsh here.  Purple marks bad angles: shadows
that don’t match, a wall that’s also a floor, and different-length
legs on a … well, I have no idea what that thing is.  Blue generally
marks things that are unidentifiable, although in the top-right one,
it marks the only floor-tree (?) that has a pot.  Unidentifiable stuff
is a venial sin; it’s a fantasy game, and sometimes there’s weird stuff
in a fantasy world.</p>

<p>Red is the real turds.  Stuff that is so our-of-place as to break
immersion.  Often it’s unidentifiable, but sometimes it’s just in the
wrong spot (like the faucet in the top left which isn’t over a sink).
The bottom left has a fractal turd: the roof of the hutch has a weird
asymmetrical fold at the top, but also, a bedroom should not contain a
hutch with an outdoor roof.</p>

<p>Once you start looking at AI-generated art, the turds are everywhere.
Midjourney often “solves” this by doing images that are impressionistic rather
than representational. I googled for “Midjourney dragon”, and this was the first hit:</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/turds-dragon.jpg" alt="A Midjourney-generated water dragon" id="amidjourney-generatedwaterdragon"/></p>

<p>Other than the inexplicable human figure (?) in the center of the
image walking on water, this doesn’t have major turds — but it’s also
clearly intended to impressionistic rather than to represent a real
scene.  I should note that several of the other images from <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/9NbNDQ">that
source</a> do have turds, such
as phantom Chinese-looking characters.  Side note: I wonder why the
dragons are disproportionately looking to the left.  In one image, the
main dragon head is looking to the right, but clearly that was
unacceptable, so there’s also a secondary head-turd looking to the
left.</p>

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>

<p>I’m not any good at music, so I can’t immediately identify the musical
turds in the AI-generated music from <a href="https://aiva.ai/">AIVA</a>.  This
is what Generated Adventure used.  AIVA seem to be generating MIDI
files, so they won’t have the same sorts of errors as AI image
generators, which operate on a pixel level.  But I can say that their
prompt following is bad.  I uploaded the first track of the
<a href="https://surfwords.com">Surfwords</a> soundtrack to AIVA.  Here’s what it
sounds like:</p>



<p>That’s a track composed by a <a href="https://www.patrickcornelius.com/">human</a>.
One of the tracks that I sent him as inspiration was this one (skip to 0:24):</p>



<p>He nailed it! Patrick’s track is maybe a little less skrawnky, but it
definitely captures the feeling and instrumentation.</p>

<p>Compare AIVA (I uploaded Patrick’s track rather than the Moon Hooch as
a “influence”, since I have the rights to it):</p>



<p>Sure, the BPM is the same (according to a random online BPM detector).
Maybe the key signature is also the same?  But it’s not even the right
instruments — AIVA suggested “Clean Rock Ensemble” for this track,
but my track is brass. (AIVA’s generated tracks with the same
influence on the Brass Ensemble setting sound even less like the
original).</p>

<p>If you don’t have a vision in mind for what your music sounds like,
AIVA is maybe fine.  Like, it sounds like generic music.  But if you
do have a vision in mind (as I did for the
<a href="https://surfwords.com">Surfwords</a> music), AIVA is not there yet.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Please don’t tell me about how I could fix this by twiddling the
Midjourney or AIVA prompts.</p>

<p>AIVA’s config options seem to be designed for people who understand
music much better than I do.  Maybe it’s a good tool if that’s your
situation.  But why offer to let me upload an influence, if you aren’t
going to do anything other than extract the BPM and key signature?  At
least get the instruments right!</p>

<p>And yes, you can paint out the turds in Midjourney and tell it to fill
in the area again until it gets it right.  But the shadows are still
going to be annoying, and the iteration time is painfully slow.</p>

<p>Soon, this might be fixed.  But not today.  It’s frustrating to be so
close, and to have everyone hyping how close we are, and to be
stuck with turds
.
(Also please don’t say mean things about the Generated Adventure
folks, who set out to do a thing and successfully did the thing; none
of this is directed at them).</p>
