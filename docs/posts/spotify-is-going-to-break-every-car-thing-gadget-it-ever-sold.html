    <h1>Spotify is going to break every Car Thing gadget it ever sold</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Spotify’s brief attempt at being a hardware company wasn’t all that successful: the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/27/23280357/spotify-stops-manufacturing-car-thing-q2-2022-earnings">stopped producing its Car Thing</a> dashboard accessory less than a year after it went on sale to the public. And now, two years later, the device is about to be rendered completely inoperable. Customers who bought the Car Thing are receiving emails warning that it will stop working altogether as of December 9th.</p><p>Unfortunately for those owners, Spotify isn’t offering any kind of subscription credit or automatic refund for the device — nor is the company open-sourcing it. Rather, it’s just canning the project and telling people to (responsibly) dispose of Car Thing.</p><p>“We’re discontinuing Car Thing as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings,” Spotify wrote in <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/">an FAQ on its website</a>. “We understand it may be disappointing, but this decision allows us to focus on developing new features and enhancements that will ultimately provide a better experience to all Spotify users.”</p><p>The company is recommending that customers do a factory reset on the product and find some way of responsibly recycling the hardware. Spotify is also being direct and confirming that there’s little reason to ever expect a sequel. “As of now, there are no plans to release a replacement or new version of Car Thing,” the FAQ reads.</p><div><p>Car Thing was initially made available on an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22380014/spotify-car-thing-release-voice-control-data-interactive-ads">invite-only basis in April 2021</a>, with Spotify later opening a public waitlist to buy the accessory <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726497/spotify-car-thing-hardware-waitlist">later that year</a>. The $90 device went on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/22/22945403/spotify-car-thing-price-release-date">general sale in February 2022</a> — and production was halted five months later.</p></div><p>The Car Thing hardware was quite nice considering it was Spotify’s first go, but the product was more of a remote control for Spotify on your mobile phone than any kind of standalone player. That limited its appeal, though the device <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CarThing/">still found a niche community</a>.</p></div></div></div>
