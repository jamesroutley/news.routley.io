</div><p>A stem cell treatment helped improve the motor function of two out of four patients with a spinal cord injury in the first clinical study of its kind, Japanese scientists said.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    <p>There is currently no effective <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/treatment/" rel="tag">treatment</a> for paralysis caused by serious spinal cord injuries, which affect more than 150,000 patients in Japan alone, with 5,000 new cases each year.</p>
<p>Researchers at Tokyo&#39;s Keio University are conducting their study using <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/induced+pluripotent+stem+cells/" rel="tag">induced pluripotent stem cells</a> (iPS)—created by stimulating mature, already specialized, cells back into a juvenile state.</p>
<p>They can then be prompted to mature into different kinds of cells, with the Keio researchers using iPS-derived cells of the neural stem.</p>
<p>The university said on Friday that the <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/motor+function/" rel="tag">motor function</a> score for two patients improved after an operation to implant more than two million iPS-derived cells into a spinal cord.</p>
<p>No serious adverse event was observed for all four cases after a year of monitoring, the university said.</p>
<p>The research&#39;s main goal was to study the safety of injecting the cells.</p>
<p>Public broadcaster NHK reported that one of the two was an elderly man who suffered the <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/injury/" rel="tag">injury</a> in an accident.</p>
<p>He is now able to stand without support and has started practicing walking, NHK said.</p>
<p>&#34;We were able to achieve results in the world&#39;s first <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/spinal+cord/" rel="tag">spinal cord</a> treatment with iPS,&#34; Hideyuki Okano, a Keio professor who heads the research, said, according to NHK.</p>
<p>Okano said the team hoped to move to a clinical trial that would be a step towards bringing the treatment to patients.</p>
<p>The university received <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/government+approval/" rel="tag">government approval</a> for their initial study in 2019 and they carried out the first operation in 2022.</p>
<p>Details of the patients remain confidential, but the team is focusing on people who were injured 14-28 days before the operation.</p>
<p>The number of cells implanted was determined after safety experiments in animals.</p>
