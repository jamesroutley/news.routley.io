    <h1>I thought I would have accomplished a lot more today and also before I was 35</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Is it 2 <em>P.M.</em> already? Ugh. I’ve done nothing today. I woke up, stretched, saw that I had six voice mails, ignored them, showered, ate three waffles, and then felt annoyed that I’m thirty-five and still don’t speak French. Wait, hang on. I didn’t shower. That was yesterday.</p><p>I tried to buy some Converse Chuck Taylors online, but I couldn’t choose between gray and obsidian, because I disliked them equally. Then I got distracted by life-hack articles on Medium for ninety minutes. I’m thirty-five! I thought I would’ve purchased cool shoes by now, and been in a movie. My improv-troupe mate Sanjay was in that indie horse movie. He’s crushing it.</p><p>My artistic motto is “Always write five hundred words before noon.” My life motto is “Write one best-seller before age thirty-five.” Today I’ve written one word, a text message to Sanjay that just says, “Hey!”—but I didn’t finish it, just like I didn’t finish my Ph.D. in political science or my engagement to Jennifer in my late twenties.</p><p>When I think about all the time I frittered away today, it agitates me, and I jump on Wikipedia to look up famous nineteenth-century circuses. Wow, the circus of Pépin and Breschard performed for Thomas Jefferson. God, why did I abandon my doctoral thesis on Jeffersonian democracy?! And why did I waste the past ten minutes staring at a picture of a handsome young Breschard standing by his horse? Perhaps I’m haunted by an aborted academic career and a clock that now says 3:12 <em>P.M.</em>? Maybe.</p><p>I was supposed to renew my car registration today. I haven’t opened the Web site. I thought that I would’ve for sure given a <em>TED</em> talk in my thirties on “How to Unleash the Infinite Writer’s Brain.” I haven’t even given a <em>TED</em>x. Damn, I really wasted the morning and the afternoon and the last ten years.</p><p>It’s O.K.! It’s only 3:40 <em>P.M.</em> I can turn this around, and—oh, my God, Benjamin Latrobe was a circus architect for Pépin and Breschard, and he designed the <em>United States Capitol</em> when he was twenty-nine. Twenty-nine! I’m thirty-five! It’s 5 <em>P.M.</em>! Fuck!</p><p>Life is strange. When academia didn’t work out, I fantasized about a new career as a famous writer, travelling the world, wearing cool shoes, having deep conversations in French. I’ve never done that. The closest I came was writing half a short story and then celebrating by shouting “bonjour!” to my roommate Felix while making myself a crêpe. Jesus, is it 9 <em>P.M.</em> already? Tuesday flew by. Nope, it’s Sunday. Goddammit.</p><p>I honestly thought I would’ve mastered dating and finance and reading Camus in his mother tongue and keeping my house plants alive by now. But I forgot to water my ficus this month, just like I forgot to found, scale, and sell a business while youth was on my side. April went by so fast. Is it May? No, it’s October. This day and this year are officially <em>hosed.</em></p><p>Why does this keep happening? I haven’t gone outside today. I haven’t slept a full night this week. I haven’t practiced my guitar this month. I haven’t said “I love you” to someone romantically in four years. Once, I said, “I love . . . ” to my ex Meredith, but I trailed off, and she said, “You love . . . ?” And I said, “Yeah, I love . . . ‘The Lord of the Rings.’ ” I’ve been rehashing that moment for an hour while rewatching the animated version of “The Two Towers,” from 1978, and not writing. 1978—my birth year. Shit, I’m actually forty-one, not thirty-five. This sucks.</p><p>It just frustrates me. Sanjay is a movie star, and he lived in Morocco for an entire year, and I’ve never even eaten at a Moroccan restaurant, and my ficus is dying, and Pépin and Breschard built successful theatres throughout North America, and they had children and wives who loved them before age thirty-five, and I’ll never be a professor or an actor or write a book, and my crêpes are so-so but not <em>restaurant quality</em>, and I still haven’t learned how a Roth I.R.A. can make my money work for me, and Jean Baptiste Breschard could balance on the back of two horses at once while dressed in a full Spanish-lace uniform with silk stockings, and he was even a comedian of sorts, telling jokes right from the backs of his horses, and it’s 12:01 <em>A.M.,</em> and I literally just turned forty-two while I was thinking this.</p></div></div></div></div>
