    <h1>ASCII protocol buffers as config files</h1>
    
    
<p>
While I don&#39;t go on the Orange Site any more, I still make enough trips 
through the larger space of similar sites to get some idea of what 
people are talking about.  Last week, the topic of interest seemed to 
be YAML and how evil it is.  I can&#39;t argue with that.  Every time I&#39;ve 
crossed paths with it, I&#39;ve been irritated by both it and whoever 
decided to use it for their stuff.
</p>
<p>
The discussions invariably start talking about alternatives, and 
frequently end up on JSON.  This is unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve mentioned this before in passing, but have never given it a whole 
post.  Today, it graduates to having a whole post about the topic.
</p>
<p>
The topic is: ASCII-form protocol buffers used as config files.
</p>
<p>
This was a tip given to me something like 17 years ago when I was &#34;on 
the inside&#34;, and it&#39;s turned out very well.  Protocol buffers have a 
canonical ASCII representation, and it accepts comments, too!  You get 
the benefits of not having to write a scanner or lexer combined with a 
system in which everything is explicitly specified, right down to the 
data types.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s an example of such a file:
</p>
<pre class="terminal"># **** Contains auth data: must be thermo:thermo 0660 or better ****

db_conninfo: &#34;host=localhost dbname=foo user=xyz_role password= ...

# barn (hardwired)
server_info {
  host: &#34;172.25.161.10&#34;
  port: &#34;18099&#34;
}

# barn (backup wireless on IoS network)
server_info {
  host: &#34;172.25.225.10&#34;
  port: &#34;18099&#34;
}

# office (broken 20230825)
# server_info {
#   host: &#34;172.25.161.17&#34;
#   port: &#34;18099&#34;
# }

sensor_location {
  name: &#34;loft&#34;
  model: &#34;Acurite-Tower&#34;
  id: &#34;1563&#34;
  channel: &#34;A&#34;
}

sensor_location {
  name: &#34;entry&#34;
  model: &#34;Acurite-Tower&#34;
  id: &#34;2375&#34;
  channel: &#34;B&#34;
}
</pre>
<p>
There.  That&#39;s not terrible, right?  It has a bunch of common stuff that 
gets repeated as needed for my different servers and sensors.  There&#39;s 
also a string that gets handed to Postgres to connect to the database.
And yes, notice the comments everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Over in protobuf-land, this is what the .proto file looks like for that
config format:
</p>
<span title="Look!  A schema!  For config data!"><pre class="terminal">syntax = &#34;proto2&#34;;

package thermo;

message LoggerConfig {
  message ServerInfo {
    required string host = 1;         // 192.168.31.67
    required string port = 2;         // 18099
  }

  message SensorLocation {
    required string name = 1;             // room
    required string model = 2;            // Acurite-Tower
    required string id = 3;               // 1015
    required string channel = 4;          // C
  }

  required string db_conninfo = 1;

  repeated ServerInfo server_info = 2;
  repeated SensorLocation sensor_location = 3;
</pre>
</span>
<p>
There&#39;s one important bit here: I&#39;m using &#34;required&#34; here since this is 
a config file format and NOT something that will be passed around over 
the network.  It lets me cheat on the field presence checks, and this is 
the one case where it&#39;s acceptable to me.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re using protobuf for anything that gets handed around to 
something else (RPC, files that get written by the program, ...), 
whether across space *or time* (i.e., future instances of yourself), 
use optional and explicitly test for the presence of fields you need in 
your own code.  You have been warned.
</p>
<p>
How does the program use it?  First, it reads the entire config file 
into a single string.  Then it creates a LoggerConfig (the outermost 
message) and tells the TextFormat flavor of protobuf to ParseFromString 
into that new message.  If that returns true, then we&#39;re in business.
</p>
<p>
I can now do things like hand config.db_conninfo() to Postgres or 
iterate over config.server_info() or config.sensor_location() to figure 
out who to talk to and what sensors to care about.
</p>
<p>
Is it perfect?  Definitely not.  It&#39;s software, which means it will 
never truly stop sucking, like all other software.  It&#39;s a dependency 
that will now follow you, your code, and your binaries around like an 
albatross.  It&#39;s yet another shared library that has to be installed 
wherever you want to run.
</p>
<p>
But, hey, if you&#39;re already paying the price of using protobuf in your 
projects for some other reason, then why not use it for config storage, 
too?
