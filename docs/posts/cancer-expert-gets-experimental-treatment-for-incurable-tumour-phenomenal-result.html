I was fit, having represented Australia at the world aquathon championships in Ibiza in early May,&#34; he said.</p><p>In June, he travelled to Poland with his wife Katie Nicoll, and the day before had gone hiking in the mountains.</p><p>&#34;I woke the next morning not feeling quite right,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;I had a brief phone call with my mum back in Tasmania. I don&#39;t remember much after that. I know now I had a seizure.&#34;</p><p>He was rushed to hospital and after a number of tests, Professor Scolyer was diagnosed with glioblastoma IDH wild-type, a cancer that&#39;s considered incurable and usually fatal within six to nine months.</p><p>One of the first phone calls Professor Scolyer&#39;s wife made from Poland was to his Melanoma Institute Australia co-medical director, Georgina Long.</p><p>&#34;Nothing had prepared me for that phone call from Katie in Poland,&#34; Professor Long said.</p><p>&#34;When I got that call, I got a physical pain like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced before and it was grief for what Richard and his family were about to go through and for the thought of losing my dear friend and colleague.&#34;</p><figure role="group" data-component="VerticalArticleFigure" aria-labelledby="102879842" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/102879842"><img alt="Richard Scolyer and Georgina Long addressing the National Press Club" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 543px," srcset="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/361b88e01a9b4899cea11d38092791b0?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=3333&amp;cropW=4444&amp;xPos=278&amp;yPos=0&amp;width=862&amp;height=647 543w, https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/361b88e01a9b4899cea11d38092791b0?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=3333&amp;cropW=5000&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=0&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/361b88e01a9b4899cea11d38092791b0?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=3333&amp;cropW=5000&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=0&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"/><p><figcaption id="102879842" data-component="VerticalArticleFigure__figcaption" aria-live="polite"> <!-- -->Richard Scolyer and Georgina Long addressing the National Press Club in Canberra.<span data-component="Byline"><span data-component="Text">(<span>AAP: Bianca De Marchi</span>)</span></span></figcaption></p></figure><h2 data-component="Heading">The melanoma expert takes on glioblastoma</h2><p>Professor Long said after that phone call, she started researching glioblastoma, speaking to experts and looking up clinical trials.</p><p>&#34;It was a barren landscape. You could count the number of immunotherapy clinical trials for glioblastoma almost on one hand,&#34; she said.</p><p>With no clinical trials available, Professor Long said she felt obligated to &#34;try something groundbreaking.&#34;</p><p>Melanoma Institute Australia has been at the forefront of treatments like immunotherapy, that have drastically improved survival rates for the deadly skin cancer.</p><p><span data-component="Loading" data-print="inline-media"><span></span><span role="alert" aria-live="assertive">Loading...</span></span></p><p>Rather than go down the usual treatment path for glioblastoma of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, they decided to try to treat Professor Scolyer in a similar way to their melanoma patients.</p><p>&#34;There was initial resistance from some in the oncology community,&#34; Professor Scolyer said.</p><p>&#34;But Katie and I spent many hours writing long letters detailing what I wanted to do and why.&#34;</p><p>Professor Scolyer was given immunotherapy, designed to activate the immune system to attack the cancer.</p><p>They also used the specific genome of his cancer to design a vaccine to target it.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Early results &#39;nothing short of phenomenal&#39;</h2><p>Twelve days after he was given the immunotherapy drugs, Professor Scolyer had surgery to have the bulk of his tumour removed.</p><p>It was then tested, to see if the drugs had an effect.</p><p>&#34;Yes, Richard is a patient of only one, but early scientific results are nothing short of phenomenal,&#34; Professor Long said.</p><p>They found there was a 10-fold increase in the immune cells in the tumour, that they were activated against the cancer and they were bound to the drug.</p><p>&#34;Proving something that we&#39;d already shown in melanoma, that there is no blood brain barrier and historically conceptualised, preventing the drugs from reaching the tumour,&#34; Professor Long said.</p><p>&#34;We could not have hoped for better results.&#34;</p><p>But the pair said it was too early to say whether those scientific results mean a better prognosis for Professor Scolyer.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">The experimental treatment a unique situation</h2><p>Professor Scolyer said at this stage the experimental treatment he has undergone won&#39;t be available to other patients.</p><p>&#34;I can only do this because I&#39;m a cancer researcher and clinician and so inherently understand the risks,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;This treatment may extend or shorten my life.&#34;</p><p>The co-medical directors said pharmaceutical companies have been reluctant to invest in glioblastoma research, but their early results mean some are starting to pay attention.</p><p>They are hopeful it will lead to clinical trials.</p><p>They have called for a change in approach to cancer research and treatment, such as looking beyond the confines of one cancer, designing better clinical trials and embedding research in clinical care.</p><p>&#34;We know we&#39;re not curing as many cancers as we could,&#34; Professor Scolyer said.</p><p>&#34;Today we call on the cancer research field to collectively re-think its approach to tackling cancer. Think big and be courageous.&#34;</p></div></div></div>
