We worked hard to put things right for customers then and have since transformed our business.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The problems were triggered when TSB tried to move 1.3 billion customer records from an old system run by its former parent bank, Lloyds, to one managed by its current Spanish owner, Sabadell.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, it proved disastrous with many customers being locked out of their accounts and some customers being given access to the confidential records of others.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Cases included people trying to complete house purchases and unsure whether they could move in. The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44008272">spoke to one couple</a> who sat with a loaded removal van outside their new home waiting for funds to be released.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Another couple who were locked out of their wedding savings were forced to grovel to their DJ and wedding car provider because they were unable to pay them as the big day approached.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Businesses were also left in difficulty. Lee MacDonald, who played Zammo in children&#39;s TV show Grange Hill in the 1980s, told BBC Radio 5 live that he was &#34;having an absolute nightmare&#34; in his locksmith business.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>PA</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Paul Pester. who was boss of the bank at the time, eventually stepped down</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Shortly after the issues emerged, Mr Pester admitted to the BBC that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43904267">the bank was &#34;on our knees&#34;.</a></p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The problems continued for many weeks and TSB came under fierce criticism for the IT failings. Mr Pester was directly, and unusually, criticised by MPs for the saga. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The FCA said while data itself was transferred successfully, the IT platform &#34;immediately experienced technical failures&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;This resulted in significant disruption to the continuity of TSB&#39;s banking services, including branch, telephone, online and mobile banking,&#34; it said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Steward added: &#34;The firm failed to plan for the IT migration properly, the governance of the project was insufficiently robust and the firm failed to take reasonable care to organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>TSB was fined a total of £48.65m - made up of a £29.75m penalty from the FCA and a fine of £18.9m from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The disruption to continuity of service experienced by TSB during its IT migration fell below the standard we expect banks to meet,&#34; said Sam Woods, the PRA&#39;s chief executive.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47085474">In February 2019,</a> TSB said that the disastrous IT upgrade had cost it £330m, and about 80,000 customers had switched their account away from the bank in 2018.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The complexity of the switchover and the problems it caused has meant a long investigation and eventual fine by the regulator. In the meantime, there has been significant reputational damage for the bank.</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
