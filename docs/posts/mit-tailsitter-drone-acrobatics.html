    <h1>MIT Tailsitter Drone Acrobatics</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fixed-wing aircraft have the potential to combine advantages from both fixed-wing aircraft or rotorcraft, like multicopters. They often exceed the range and endurance limitations typical of multicopters, while maintaining the capability to take-off, hover, and land in confined spaces. This versatility is relevant to many real-world applications. For example, transitioning search and rescue aircraft can cover large areas efficiently and closely inspect (indoor) areas of particular interest.<br/></p><p>Tailsitter VTOL aircraft transition between hover and forward flight by pitching, so that their rotors transition between lift generation and forward propulsion based on the attitude. The tailsitter flying wing omits a tail and vertical surfaces, leading to a relatively simple mechanical design consisting of just a wing, two rotors, and two flaps that function as both elevators and ailerons. By placing these flaps in the rotor wash and using differential thrust, the aircraft remains controllable throughout the flight envelope, including static conditions. The simple, lightweight design allows a high thrust-to-weight ratio and the absence of a vertical tail surface reduces directional stability, leading to a highly agile and maneuverable aircraft.</p></div></div>
