    <p>I started writing this retrospective during my last week at Google, I have already wrapped up everything, had my goodbyes. In the spirit of SRE (as an ex-SRE), I thought it would be fun to write a little retrospective in the form of a <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/">postmortem</a>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I joined Google young and relatively inexperienced and had spent about 9 years there.</p>
<p>I started my journey in software at 19 (first internship) and then continued working part and full time while continuing my degree in Applied Physics. I got disillusioned with working in physics during the course of my degree, software turned out to be a more promising career path.</p>
<p>At some point I got head hunted by a Google sourcer. That resulted in an internship in London when I was 22, later I joined full time in Dublin. I worked in several teams around three products: Bigtable, Persistent Disk and GCE VMs (virtual machines). I include a detailed timeline at the bottom of this post.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-expect-from-joining-google">What did I expect from joining Google?</h2>
<p>After I got a taste of Google during my London internship, I was excited for more. What appealed to me was the level of engineering, how sophisticated and interesting the technology was and the level of engineers.</p>
<p>My only experience until then was with small software houses and startups in Poland, but Googleâ€¦ Google had some of the best tech in the world, and I had an opportunity to work with it and learn it. That was making me very excited.</p>
<p>Google impressed me. I didnâ€™t see myself bored easily, I could stay in for longer, maybe even 5 years and I would still continue learning.
Other things that appealed to me were the pay, the perks and fun international community.</p>
<p>From the big picture perspective, I wanted to start my own company, but a detour at Google could give me skills, fun and money to be better positioned to that in the future. I took the plunge.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-was-it">So, how was it?</h2>
<p>Overall, it was incredible. There were ups and downs. Heartwarming moments, joy of teamwork, satisfaction, as well as lots of stresses and frustrations.</p>
<p>It was a mutually beneficial exchange, I poured my energy, soul and cognitive resources and I got form it:</p>
<ul>
<li>tons of money</li>
<li>engineering skills, low and high level, great systems understanding and world class skills in handling crises and debugging</li>
<li>leadership and management skills</li>
<li>satisfaction from being part of a cool company</li>
<li>cool offsites and business travels</li>
<li>lifestyle perks, including things like pool in the office, world class gym, all sort of sport classes, weekly massages, tasty and/or healthy meals, healthcare on site</li>
<li>great community and relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point the exchange became less attractive to me. There were several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>reached/exceeded my financial goals</li>
<li>fascination with Google tech waned:</li>
<li>industry somewhat caught up</li>
<li>reality of actual work not being that mind blowing</li>
<li>my interests saturated/shifted</li>
<li>desire to start my own company (yes, I can wait, but not for decades!)</li>
<li>company became less fun/cool</li>
<li>budget cuts (less business travel, no mind blowing offsites anymore)</li>
<li>layoffs</li>
<li>Head Count shifting to cheap locations aggressively - less opportunity for me to grow my organization locally</li>
<li>lots of overheads related to security/regulations</li>
<li>many hard engineering challenges due to complex systems and relationships between teams slowing the velocity</li>
<li>cognitive load - this was less of a factor in my last role, but bigger problem in the previous one. Google tech has lots of complexity and nuance, itâ€™s pretty typical that an industry hire employee might need a year to fully ramp up which is pretty crazy</li>
<li>opportunities for personal growth somewhat unclear</li>
<li>there were no dramatic shifts in sight, just more of the same (which is also valuable, I just didnâ€™t want coast)</li>
<li>tapped out career-wise: L6 ICs are pretty rare - it already is a top tier of seniority in engineering, I was not really interested in L7 as L7 is more of a political role than the engineering one on the individual track, and on the management track there was no headcount in sightâ€¦ if I had an opportunity to become a manager of managers and run a big org under myself I would stay longer</li>
<li>shape of the technical work was not aligned with my interest in what I would like to be growing at.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s hard to compress 9 years of learning into a bunch of bullet points. I learned technical skills, I learned soft skills, I became a better and a wiser person and a leader.</p>
<p>And in the spirit of being a (somewhat) anxious overachiever, I consistently felt that I could be doing better along the way - always motivating me to strive and learn.</p>
<h3 id="what-went-well">What went well</h3>
<ul>
<li>I got promoted quickly</li>
<li>I ended at L6 which is highly regarded and well compensated</li>
<li>I always had lots of autonomy</li>
<li>I could always push back for work life balance (reasonable hours and workload)</li>
<li>inspiring, motivated and smart coworkers</li>
<li>earn more money that I could have imagined</li>
<li>used a lot of perks that enabled very healthy lifestyle</li>
<li>lots of fun travels for work (business and offsites)</li>
<li>grew as an engineer and as a leader</li>
<li>drastically improved my soft skills</li>
<li>made a lot of work friends</li>
<li>learned about lots of cool technologies</li>
<li>had an opportunity to create my own team from scratch</li>
<li>working 60% or 80% were fantastic for my lifestyle and building relationships outside of work</li>
<li>learned a lot of tools for dealing with (chronic) stress</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-went-poorly">What went poorly</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have overstayed as SRE - Dublin didnâ€™t have much options and I didnâ€™t move to a different site (inertia, personal reasons, etc)</li>
<li>oncall was stressing me out and disrupting my sleep,</li>
<li>not the best fit for my personality which is more optimistic and creative - this led to feeling of misalignment, I felt somewhat unfulfilled at - work in terms of type of work and projects and compensated outside of work with side projects</li>
<li>24/7 nature of the organization was making it hard to disconnect</li>
<li>USA centric culture, if you are not in USA at Google and donâ€™t have a big presence in a location itâ€™s a bit like swimming upstream, itâ€™s easy to feel isolated, sidelined or on the flipside overwhelmed with late meetings</li>
<li>Promised HC not landing - e.g. I was promised further expansion twice, which later was scratched and then promised again in a bit different formâ€¦</li>
<li>senior level managers overwhelmed and not providing support/feedback or pretty much any oversight (there were moments when things felt a bit like a wild west)</li>
<li>there were many periods when I felt like I was overwhelmed with meetings/repetitive work/underresourced team, but at the same time not having good engineering/or management growth opportunities</li>
<li>cognitive load at Google is very high - there is a countless number of systems and technologies that itâ€™s useful to have in mind and can affect your system in one way or another (this is especially bad in SRE)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="where-did-i-get-lucky">Where did I get lucky?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Google stock did very well, additionally with my rapid career trajectory, I did very well too ðŸ™‚</li>
<li>The people I hired turned out to be really solid</li>
<li>I somehow figured things out - building a track record of being high performer even though some things were definitely stretch opportunities</li>
<li>I made good financial decisions, could have been luckier, but the decisions had good thought process</li>
<li>I made amazing connections</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-could-i-have-done-differently">What could I have done differently?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Move out of SRE earlier since from the beginning I knew it wasnâ€™t what I wanted</li>
<li>Move to a different site - itâ€™s easy to cling to a thing that is already good, there is a cost of switching as well, but I undervalued exploration historically</li>
<li>Take more advantage of education reimbursements (e.g. take more stanford online courses)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-items">Action items</h2>
<p>A typical postmortem would present a table of categorized action items. But Iâ€™m not here to mobilize anyoneâ€¦</p>
<p>The next thing for me is a sabbatical consisting of at least 6 months on exploring, relaxing, learning new things and expanding my idea of what I could be doing next.</p>
<p>I have a tendency to underexplore and I love being productive with a clear objective, so a sabbatical is a psychological challenge. I will be writing more on the topic so stay tuned!</p>
