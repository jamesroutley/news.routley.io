<p><SPAN size="5"><b>Why computer modeling should
become a popular hobby</b></SPAN></p>

<p><b>Ken Forbus</b></p>

<p>Building and playing with models has always been a popular
hobby. Model trains, cars, boats, airplanes, helicopters and
rockets enable us to experience vicariously some of the thrills
and excitement of vehicles that we might never have the
opportunity to operate in real life. Models of famous buildings,
people, and events help deepen our understanding by providing
concrete representations that engage our senses. Model-building
is one way of coming to grips (sometimes literally) with aspects
of our world that would otherwise be beyond our grasp. For this
reason museums are filled with models, and models are widely used
in education. But models and model-building are so enjoyable that
many people do it on their own, for fun, as a quick tour of any
good hobby shop or toy store will indicate. Different people
enjoy different kinds of models, ranging from everyday objects
like cars and houses to things that never were like starships and
werewolves. <br/>
</p>

<p>I believe that one consequence of the performance/price
revolution still underway in computing will be the rise of
computer-based modeling as a popular hobby. Like modeling today,
computer modeling activities will range from the creation of
static models which depict the structure and appearance of things
(i.e., VRML models of famous buildings) to dynamic simulations
that let the player experience the consequences of things that
are uneconomical or impossible to do in real life (i.e., twiddle
the parameters of a planet&#39;s ecology). Physical models can
provide cutaway views that let you see aspects of something that
would be invisible in the real artifact, but computer models can
also provide visualization tools and explanation facilities that
support multiple perspectives, ranging from the microscopic to
the cosmic, and integrated access to enough background materials
to slake anyone&#39;s thirst for knowledge. Physical models that
reproduce behavior are limited by the physics of the world, while
computer models have much looser bounds. It takes large fields to
fly model airplanes and model rockets, but only a large CPU and
memory to fly computer models of them. Physical models require
space and materials to build and operate, computer models require
disk space. For most people with computers, it is already easier
to find disk space for a VRML model of the Süleyman Mosque than
it is to find shelf space for an equivalently detailed physical
model. As the price of computing continues to plummet, and the
price of housing doesn&#39;t, this difference will be felt even more
strongly. The VRML model is also a lot easier to dust, and when
one is tired of it, much easier to recycle. Physical models of
living things can reproduce very few behaviors, compared to
simulation models, and physical models simply cannot capture the
sorts of species-level and conceptual-level phenomena that
artificial life and artificial intelligence models do. Computer
models enable you to run companies and civilizations, fight
battles, and evolve new species, activities which simply aren&#39;t
possible with physical models, with the major cost being loss of
sleep. <br/>
</p>

<p>No doubt you may be reminded of existing commercial products,
such as the &#34;Sim&#34; games from Maxis and the various
QuickTime VR models that are now available. Indeed, these ideas
grew from contemplating such products. However, I believe that
there are several advances, some technological and some social,
needed before computer modeling will become as popular as it
might be. The rest of this essay examines why promoting computer
modeling as a hobby could be a wise thing for society to do, and
how it might be done. <br/>
</p>

<p>Outside of those who might do it, why should anyone care about
computer modeling as a hobby? The failure of our educational
system to prepare people for today&#39;s technological world is
well-known. Democratic ideals are threatened when citizens do not
understand science and mathematics well enough to understand
their impact on public policy. Crash courses in &#34;computer
literacy&#34; or generating lists of facts that every well
educated person might want to know are not solutions. Having
memorized a list of key facts won&#39;t, for example, help someone
understand how to evaluate statistical evidence or the possible
long-term effects of a small but steady change in a system with
complex dynamics. Instead, I believe that a significant part of
the answer lies in viewing simulations and computer models as a
new expressive medium. <br/>
</p>

<p>Imagine the impact on human culture if the skills of running,
interpreting, and creating computer models were as widespread as
the skills of reading, interpreting, and writing text are today.
The person on the street would have new intellectual tools for
making sense of the world around them. Decision-making might
improve as the public understanding of issues moves beyond
sound-bites. The fog surrounding economic projections, and the
other uses and abuses of statistical evidence in politics, might
lift at least a little. Unlike many hermeneutic activities
spawned by the Information Age, modeling urges one to look
outward at that which is being modeled, which could lead to more
involvement and less passivity. The widespread establishment of
computer modeling as a hobby seems to me one clearly necessary
aspect of broadening cultural participation, just as reading for
pleasure and writing for personal purposes were necessary driving
factors for widespread use of text.<br/>
</p>

<p>Conservatives might view the idea of computer modeling as a
hobby similar to other forms of modeling as heresy. Indeed, I
believe it would be a tragedy if computer modeling completely
replaced more traditional modeling activities. No one should miss
the experience of crafting a tangible object representing
something that they find really intriguing. However, in today&#39;s
world, many people already do miss that experience. The joys of
computer modeling overlap the joys of physical modeling: Less
tangible, but wider variety. The skills computer modeling
requires overlap those required for physical modeling: Less
manual dexterity, more numerical and logical dexterity. Ideally,
computer modeling will complement physical modeling where they
overlap. Indeed, there are already programs for designing model
aircraft, and flight simulators that mimic the experience of
flying a remote control aircraft, so that first fifty mistakes
one makes while learning to fly don&#39;t each cost dozens of hours
of repair work. On the other hand, the plasticity of the medium
vastly increases the range of phenomena that can be modeled by
computer as opposed to by physical models. This increased range
makes it more likely that someone will find some activity that
interests them: If one doesn&#39;t find race cars exciting, maybe one
will find creating animals that can thrive in a desert
environment, policies that prevent the extinction of tigers, or
agents that can hold their own in an on-line discussion of
presidential politics, more to taste.<br/>
</p>

<p>What will it take for computer modeling to become more popular
as a hobby? We can take the widespread availability of powerful
computers for granted, thanks to the strong market desire for
multimedia computing. The limiting factors right now are
software. Much can be done with the imaginative use of existing
tools, as the computer gaming industry has shown. However, I
believe it is important to create new tools and technologies that
expand people&#39;s abilities, and make simulation even more
accessible. Here are some examples: </p>

<ul>
    <li><i>Customizable simulations</i>. Most simulations allow
        you to only change a handful of parameters over a narrow
        range. Simulations that make it easy to explore the
        consequences of major model changes, such as plugging in
        a different traffic model in SimCity 2000, enable more
        people to get &#34;under the hood&#34; and experiment
        in ways they find meaningful. (Soloway&#39;s <a href="http://Krusty.eecs.umich.edu/highc/projects/sw/model/modelit.html">Model-It
        </a>is a good example.) </li>
    <li><i>Easy to use visualization tools</i>. The ability to
        graphically depict the results of a simulation and
        simplify the process of comparing these results to
        real-world data is essential for removing much of the
        remaining drudgery in interpreting a simulation. (The <a href="http://www.covis.nwu.edu/">CoVis project</a>&#39;s
        visualization tools are a good example.) </li>
    <li><i>Simulation construction kits</i>. Like Erector Sets
        and Lego, we need a variety of software tool kits that
        provide high-level tools for creating models in
        particular areas of interest. (Repenning&#39;s <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/ambach/public_html/agentsheets_html/agentsheets_page.html">AgentSheets</a>
        is a good example.) </li>
    <li><i>Consumer CAD tools</i>. Software simple enough for the
        person on the street to use for creating and customizing
        object models. (Eisenberg&#39;s <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~l3d/systems/hypergami/">HyperGami</a>
        system is a good example.) </li>
    <li><i>Shared federated simulation environments</i>. Several
        on-line services already offer shared virtual
        environments where players can race cars or fight battles
        together. What if, in addition to driving standard cars,
        they could &#34;soup up&#34; their simulated cars by
        dropping in a new motor? Designing your own components
        for such simulations could be possible with <a href="http://www.qrg.ils.nwu.edu/ideas/avlidea.htm">articulate
        virtual laboratories</a>. </li>
    <li><i>Articulate simulations</i>. Incorporating a deep
        conceptual understanding of a domain in a simulator that
        is tied directly to its numerical component enables the
        simulator to explain its results in human-like terms.
        Using qualitative physics techniques to embed this
        understanding in software also enables such simulators to
        be generated automatically, from high-level descriptions.
        (<a href="http://www.qrg.ils.nwu.edu/ideas/sesidea.htm">Self-explanatory
        simulators</a> are a good example.) </li>
</ul>

<p>A variety of opportunities will appear as computer modeling
becomes more popular as a hobby. Schools will use the creation
and interpretation of simulations with a frequency approaching
that of reading and writing. Companies will sell models,
simulation construction kits, and data sets. Organizations will
sponsor modeling contests, with prizes in categories such as
highest accuracy, most elegant, and most computationally
efficient simulations. Part of the fun of a hobby is
communication with like-minded folks. The Web is the obvious
medium for publishing papers, code, and data. Digital libraries
can play a valuable role, as a clearinghouse for data and models.
Ultimately, the most important opportunity is for all of us to be
able to explore our world better than we ever could before.</p>
