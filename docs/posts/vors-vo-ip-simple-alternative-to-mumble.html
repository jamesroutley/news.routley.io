    <h1>VoRS: Vo(IP) Simple Alternative to Mumble</h1>

<p>VoRS – Vo(IP) Really Simple.
Very simple and usable multi-user VoIP solution.
Some kind of alternative to <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a>.
</p>
<p>But why? SIP-based solutions are pretty complicated to setup, because
they are not made for simple tasks like sudden voice chats between a
few people. WebRTC-based solutions are insane bloated incredible
monsters by complexity and size, hardly possible to debug and having
frequent compatibility problems. They work mainly only if you use the
same kind of software and codecs, for example Chromium, that requires
dozens of gigabytes of disk space and much RAM, CPU time to build it.
Taking an enormous amount of CPU power to slowly work with it. Is not
it pure insanity for such relatively simple task?
</p>
<p>Mumble has wonderful simplicity and workability, but even its server
side is still written on Qt, which requires hundreds of megabytes of
additional libraries to build it up. And users tend to complain about
its newer client versions quality and convenience.
</p>
<p>So let’s write as simple VoIP talking client as it is possible, without
compromising convenience and simplicity for the user! I just want a
simple command, which only requires to specify the server’s address with
the key to just immediately talk with someone.
</p>
<ul>
<li>No GUI requirement. Why would someone need a GUI for voice
application? But a fancy real-time refreshing TUI would be desirable.
Mumble tends to output no information, sometimes hiding the fact of a
problem and that everything stopped working.

</li><li>Mono-cypher, mono-codec protocol.

</li><li>Maximal easiness of usage: here is your address, key, do me good.

</li></ul>

<p>VoRS is
