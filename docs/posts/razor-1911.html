<p>The group was founded as <i>Razor 2992</i> by Doctor No, Insane TTM and Sector9 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a> in October 1985 as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_cracking" title="Software cracking">software cracking</a> group. Shortly after, they changed from 2992 to 1911 which translates to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/777_(number)#Computing" title="777 (number)">777</a> in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal" title="Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a>.
</p><p>Between 1987 and 1988 the group began to move away from the Commodore 64 and migrated to a new hardware platform, coding demos and cracking games for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga" title="Amiga">Amiga</a>. In the very early 1990s Razor 1911 made another transition, this time to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC" title="IBM PC">IBM PC</a>, foremost as a cracking group, but still continuing to release <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_intro" title="Crack intro">cracktro loaders</a>, demos and music.
</p><p>Razor was a supply group on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk" title="Floppy disk">diskette</a> from 1992 until diskettes were abandoned for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM" title="CD-ROM">CD-ROMs</a>. Throughout the 1990s Razor faced competition from many different groups, ranging from groups such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristar_and_Red_Sector_Incorporated" title="Tristar and Red Sector Incorporated">Tristar &amp; Red Sector inc.</a> (TRSi), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Network_of_Crackers" title="International Network of Crackers">International Network of Crackers</a> (INC) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairlight_(group)" title="Fairlight (group)">Fairlight</a> (FLT) in 1994 to Prestige, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hybrid_(warez)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Hybrid (warez) (page does not exist)">Hybrid</a> (HBD), and others in 1995. Razor was revitalised by new members gained from another group, Nexus, who brought with them some UK suppliers and the leaders The Speed Racer (TSR), Hot Tuna and The Gecko. Razor had a handful of others throughout the 1990s, such as Zodact, ROMKernel, The Renegade Chemist (TRC), The WiTcH KiNG, Butcher, SwiTch, Marauder, and Randall Flagg.
</p><p>Razor 1911 took a break from the demoscene in 1992. In 1993 a new demogroup calling itself Razor 1911 formed, in which Colorbird was the only original member of Razor 1911. Razor 1911 was still active as a software cracking group.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1995 diskette releases were rapidly being supplanted by CD-ROMs, and Razor 1911 moved into the CD-ripping scene. The crew that led Razor into this new chapter included members such as TSR, Pharaoh, Fatal Error, GRIZZLY, Suspicious Image, Third Son, Hot Tuna, Beowulf, Pitbull, Bunter, Manhunter, Niteman, Vitas, Mausioso and The Punisher.
</p><p>Razor once again took on a new challenge when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660" title="ISO 9660">ISO</a> scene was formed. Razor 1911 began to release ISOs when they became the standard of the day, led most significantly by The Punisher. He was instrumental in Razor&#39;s recovery and its solid performance in the ISO scene. Following The Punisher&#39;s retirement, Razor was led by various different people and underwent some internal problems in the form of leadership challenges. This was solved when Pitbull, an old Razor member from the 1990s, took over the leadership role. The FBI claimed him to still be the leader of Razor at the time when &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Buccaneer" title="Operation Buccaneer">Operation Buccaneer</a>&#34;, an international anti-piracy operation which led to raids at the homes of over 60 piracy suspects worldwide in 2001, was carried out even though NFOs and scene activity at the time points out The Renegade Chemist as actual leader of the group.
</p><p>Sean Michael Breen was convicted in 2004 to &#34;50 months in prison and three years of supervised release, for violating the criminal copyright laws as a member of the first computer game piracy ring on the Internet, and for defrauding Cisco Systems&#34;.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> The press release alleges them to be the leader of the group, although their nickname is not mentioned.

<p>On June 22, 2006, Razor 1911 started releasing games again. They have been releasing games fairly consistently ever since, and as of 2010 are among the most prolific groups at cracking new releases.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
