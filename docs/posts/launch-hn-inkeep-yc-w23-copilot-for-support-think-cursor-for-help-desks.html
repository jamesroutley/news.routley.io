    <h1>Launch HN: Inkeep (YC W23) – Copilot for Support (think Cursor for help desks)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN, We’re Nick and Robert, founders of Inkeep (<a href="https://inkeep.com">https://inkeep.com</a>). We help companies turn their content into AI support copilots.
So far, we’d focused on customer-facing experiences (e.g. find us as an “Ask AI” button in the docs of companies like Anthropic and Pinecone). Today, we’re excited to share our new copilot, Keep, which is designed specifically for support agents.</p><p>It’s a conversational sidebar you can use as an app for Zendesk or Chrome Extension for any support platform. There’s a demo video at <a href="https://vid.inkeep.com/cx-copilot">https://vid.inkeep.com/cx-copilot</a> or you can try the live sandbox with example tickets at <a href="https://try.inkeep.com/cx-copilot">https://try.inkeep.com/cx-copilot</a>.</p><p>Why? Most AI support tools today are focused on trying to have AI answer customer questions before they even reach support teams (‘deflection’). We’d focused on that too. However, we heard from many of our customers that while they care about deflection, they care even more about providing high-quality, fast human support when users need it. Some teams don’t even want customer-facing AI at all and just want AI tools to help their team be more efficient. We created Keep with these scenarios in mind.</p><p>Keep does a few neat things we haven’t seen elsewhere:</p><p>1. Provides intelligent suggestions: if Keep is confident, it’ll create a draft answer and tell you the sources it used. If the ticket is long, it’ll summarize the conversation so far and outline the remaining to-dos. All automatic and contextual to the ticket.</p><p>2. Is fully conversational: ask for clarifications, revise draft answers, and iterate as needed.</p><p>3. Uses ‘Generative UI’: suggestions are rendered as glanceable, interactive UI components. For example, a draft answer has buttons like “Shorten” &amp; “Concise” that prompt the AI to revise the answer. UI components are interweaved within normal text.</p><p>4. Turns tickets into FAQs: can generate an FAQ from a closed ticket and lets you iterate on it and save it when done.</p><p>5. Leverages many content types: uses your docs, help center, previous support tickets, Slack threads, etc.</p><p>We were inspired by tools like Cursor, Claude Artifacts, and v0. These experiences go beyond plain-text conversations by interweaving interactive code blocks or UI previews into their answers. This makes answers digestible and intuitive (and fun) to iterate on.</p><p>Some technical details, for those interested: We use the Vercel AI SDK to optimistically stream the React components by using our Chat APIs, which are powered by Claude Sonnet 3.5 and our RAG service. Our APIs follow the OpenAI chat completion format so are generally compatible with any LLM tooling. Our `inkeep-qa` API generates draft answers and the `inkeep-context` API generates structured outputs and tool calls (docs: <a href="https://go.inkeep.com/ai-api">https://go.inkeep.com/ai-api</a>). For an example of how these APIs are used, check out our Intelligent Support Form example (demo: <a href="https://try.inkeep.com/ai-form">https://try.inkeep.com/ai-form</a>, repo: <a href="https://quickstart.inkeep.com/ai-form">https://quickstart.inkeep.com/ai-form</a>).</p><p>If you want to try Inkeep on your product&#39;s content, just fill out the form in our landing page. You’ll get a demo in your inbox powered by your public content — NO “call us”, “book a demo”, or “schedule a meeting” required. Note: we do check that your email domain matches your content to prevent spam.</p><p>Curious to hear about your experiences when working with customer/support questions and any ideas on how else the copilot could be useful for those scenarios.</p></div></td></div></div>
