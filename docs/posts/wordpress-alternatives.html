    <h1>WordPress Alternatives</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <heading-anchors>
        <div><p>üìù</p><p>Editor note: Due to this article&#39;s unexpected attention, I&#39;ve included a few more alternatives that people suggested. I&#39;ve also added some contextual notes you should know before diving into these options.</p></div><p>Due to <em>gestures vaguely, </em>everything going on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/catching-up-on-the-wordpress-wp-engine-sitch/" rel="noreferrer">right now with WordPress</a>, I thought I&#39;d put together a list of alternative CMSs that better fit the criteria someone might have for their website. The modern CMS landscape is super broad, with the very definition of &#34;Content Management System&#34; being stretched. Some see it as a full-package website platform, and some see it as just UI for their content stored elsewhere.</p><p>The criteria for this list are &#34;Can it be downloaded, dropped onto a server, and you&#39;ll have a website?&#34; This eliminates API and git-based CMSs, which I enjoy using; however, wiring a daisy chain of tools is just not viable for many.</p><figure><a href="https://ghost.org"><div><p>Ghost: The best open source blog &amp; newsletter platform</p><p>Beautiful, modern publishing with email newsletters and paid subscriptions built-in. Used by Platformer, 404Media, Lever News, Tangle, The Browser, and thousands more.</p><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/Z24D4b6-favicon-1.ico" alt=""/></p></div><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/Z1hjw9Q-ghost.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a></figure><p>People will already know I have a soft spot for Ghost. But what you might not know is what I&#39;d recommend for hosting.</p><figure><a href="https://www.magicpages.co"><div><p>Magic Pages</p><p>Get your Ghost CMS publication up and running in no time with Magic Pages‚Äô Ghost CMS web hosting ‚Äì starting at $4/month!</p><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/iczFH-favicon-196x196-1.jpg" alt=""/><span>Magic Pages</span></p></div><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/Z1EYPIA-MagicPages.co-3.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a></figure><p>Magic Pages is what I&#39;m using for <a href="https://designsystems.wtf" rel="noreferrer">Design Systems WTF</a>, and it&#39;s been great! The uptime is good, the price is very reasonable, and <a href="https://www.jannis.io" rel="noreferrer">Jannis</a> provides a personal touch with support. In addition, this sidesteps Ghost&#39;s own hosting option (Ghost Pro), which I would be wary of due to <a href="https://x.com/amyhoy/status/1449482190224384000">past experiences with other customers</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://getkirby.com"><div><p>Kirby is the CMS that adapts to you</p><p>Kirby is the content management system that adapts to any project. Made for developers, designers, creators and clients.</p><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/1CTUoB-favicon.1704303350.svg" alt=""/><span>Kirby CMS</span></p></div><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/1RRwiG-opengraph.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a></figure><p>I have not used Kirby in client work, but I hear only good things. It&#39;s file-based, which seems super appealing to someone like myself who gets cold sweats when opening a database.</p><figure><a href="https://getindiekit.com"><div><p>Indiekit</p><p>The little server that connects your website to the independent web.</p><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/1Py0ge-icon.svg" alt=""/><span>Get Started</span></p></div><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/Z1QWsfN-opengraph-image.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a></figure><p>Indiekit seems like an interesting option; it&#39;s also file-based but needs a database to manage existing content.</p><figure><a href="https://craftcms.com"><div><p>Craft CMS</p><p>Craft is a flexible, user-friendly CMS for creating custom digital experiences on the web and beyond.</p><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/1o1WvD-apple-touch-icon.png" alt=""/><span>Craft CMS</span></p></div><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/ZXh3Gs-social-craft-cms.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a></figure><p>It&#39;s a bit more of a commercial option with Craft CMS, but it does offer a free option for solo creators. Warning, though, as you&#39;ll need to spend time architecting your content structure by the looks of it.</p><figure><a href="https://www.classicpress.net"><div><p>ClassicPress | Stable. Lightweight. Instantly Familiar.</p><p>ClassicPress is a community-led open source content management system. A fork of WordPress 4.9, it retains the WordPress classic editor as the default option.</p><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/1MLpdH-cropped-icon-gradient-500x500.png" alt=""/><span>ClassicPress</span></p></div><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/1lFgeF-classicpress-cms-for-creators.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a></figure><p>ClassicPress appears to be a direct fork of WordPress but at version 6.2.3. It seems perfect for anyone looking for &#34;the good old days.&#34; However, it uses the official WordPress plugin API, so it&#39;s not a 100% clean break if that&#39;s what you&#39;re going for.  Thanks to <a href="https://voxpelli.com" rel="noreferrer">Pelle Wessman</a> for this suggestion.</p><figure><a href="https://statamic.com"><div><p>Statamic is a powerful, highly scalable CMS built on Laravel.</p><p>The open source, flat-first, Laravel + Git powered CMS designed for building easy to manage websites.</p><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/Z2ddyQl-favicon-196x196.png" alt=""/><span>Statamic</span></p></div><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/Z1MKo0C-card-2023.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a></figure><p>I&#39;ve had several people suggest Statamic. It does look pretty good, plus they have a free solo plan (similar to Craft CMS). I think if the cofounder hadn&#39;t brazenly <a href="https://jaygeorge.co.uk/blog/intolerance">endorsed a horrendously damaging politician</a>, I&#39;d have tried it.</p><p>I was going to suggest <a href="https://grabaperch.com" rel="noreferrer">Perch</a> and <a href="http://buckets.io" rel="noreferrer">Buckets</a> on this list, but public activity seems low for both. The Perch website even has SSL certificate issues, which isn&#39;t a good sign. Check them out if you&#39;re interested, but you have been warned.</p><h3 id="honourable-mention">Honourable mention</h3><figure><a href="http://anchorcms.com"><div><p>Lifting Anchor</p><p>Help on how to use Anchor</p><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/p9SGH-1433533.png" alt=""/><span>Anchor CMS</span></p></div><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/Z2kqVUC-screenshot.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a></figure><p>Many years ago, I contributed to Anchor, a humble PHP-based CMS that grew a little community around itself. Sadly, the creator, Charlotte, passed away in 2020, and the remaining core team couldn&#39;t keep the project going while juggling other responsibilities. I think of it fondly and wish we could give it the time it deserves. </p><p>The theming and custom types aspects were wonderfully simple; heck, I even made a whole site dedicated to themes and sites built with it:</p><figure><a href="https://anchorthemes.com"><div><p>Welcome - Anchor Themes</p><p>Themes and sites built for &lt;a href=‚Äúhttps://anchorcms.com‚Äù&gt;Anchor&lt;/a&gt;, obviously</p><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/xtffw-link-icon.svg" alt=""/><span>Anchor Themes</span><span>David Darnes</span></p></div><p><img src="https://darn.es/img/Z1nRKSm-facebook.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a></figure><p>I&#39;ll try to keep this list up to date if I recall any others I&#39;ve used in the past. Hopefully, you find this useful if you&#39;re seeking alternative CMSs.</p>
