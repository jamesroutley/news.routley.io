    <h1>Matrix 2.0 Is Here</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Since the outset of Matrix, our aim has always been to provide a protocol that lets you build open, decentralised,
secure communication apps which outperform the mainstream centralised alternatives.  It’s been a twisty journey - first
focusing on making Matrix work at all (back in 2014), and then getting it out of beta with Matrix 1.0 in 2019, and now
focusing on making Matrix fast, usable and mainstream-ready with Matrix 2.0.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the pendulum of decentralisation continues to accelerate in our direction. Our friends at Bluesky have shown
that it’s possible to build decentralised social apps which are mainstream friendly enough for
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/31/bluesky-tops-app-charts-and-sees-all-time-highs-after-brazil-bans-x/">Presidents</a> to
recommend them; Elon continues to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/x-elon-musk-bans-blocking">destroy Twitter</a> and showcase
the importance of decentralisation to everyone, and even Meta is dabbling in decentralised social media (and
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2024/09/whatsapp-dma/">decentralised communication</a>!)</p>
<p>So, where does Matrix sit in all this? Well, in order to make the transition to mainstream, we’ve been beavering away to
implement four main pillars in Matrix 2.0:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instant login, instant launch, and instant sync (aka Simplified Sliding Sync, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4186">MSC4186</a>)</li>
<li>Next Generation Auth (aka Native OIDC, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861">MSC3861</a>)</li>
<li>Native Matrix Encrypted Multiparty VoIP/Video (aka MatrixRTC, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4143">MSC4143</a>)</li>
<li>Invisible Encryption (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4153">MSC4153</a> &amp; friends).</li>
</ol>
<p>Between these, we believe that Matrix can now be used to build apps which genuinely outperform the mainstream
alternatives - and what’s more, <strong>these MSCs now all have implementations you can use today.</strong>  The MSCs themselves are
not all finalised and ready for merge (but are getting close), and when they pass FCP (Final Comment Period) to merge
into the spec, we will formally bump the spec release to version 2.0.</p>
<p>We actually declared Matrix 2.0 as ready for action back at The Matrix Conference last month, and now that the
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2024/10/29/matrixconf/">videos have been published</a> you can watch the launch right here:</p>
