    <h2>What is Meld?</h2>
    <p>
    Meld is a visual diff and merge tool targeted at developers. Meld
    helps you compare files, directories, and version controlled
    projects. It provides two- and three-way comparison of both files
    and directories, and has support for many popular version control
    systems.
    </p>
    <p>
    Meld helps you review code changes and understand patches. It might even
    help you to figure out what is going on in that merge you keep avoiding.

    <h2>Getting it</h2>

  <div>
    <p>
    Meld is packaged for most Linux/Unix distributions, including Fedora,
    Ubuntu, and Suse. Unless you want the absolutely latest version, you should
    install Meld through your package manager.
    </p>
    <p>
    Windows users should download the MSI, or for older releases, check out the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/meld-installer/">Meld installer</a>
    project.
    </p>
    <p>
    On OS X, Meld is not yet officially supported. For pre-built binaries,
    <a href="https://github.com/yousseb/meld/releases/">these OS X builds</a>
    are the best option. You can also get Meld from MacPorts, Fink or Brew;
    none of these methods are supported.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can also run Meld without installing it. Just extract the archive and
    run <code>bin/meld</code> from the archive folder.
