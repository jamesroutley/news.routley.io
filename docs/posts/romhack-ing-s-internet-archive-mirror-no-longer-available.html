    <h1>Romhack.ing&#39;s Internet Archive Mirror No Longer Available</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>For a handful of months, RHDI provided an archive.org mirror of the site&#39;s file archives. The site&#39;s servers synced with the backup daily to ensure it was up to date. This was done to allow for data hoarders to download the site&#39;s archives.</p>
<p>After two takedowns due to being flagged as malware, reaching out to support to no avail, and our IA account and associated email being labelled as spam, we are announcing that this feature has been sunset for the site being. A lot of other romhacking sites have similar issues of having uploads being flagged because antivirus engines are awful and produce false positives on patchers.</p>
<p>We are open to alternative solutions and support on the matter.</p></div></div></div></div>
