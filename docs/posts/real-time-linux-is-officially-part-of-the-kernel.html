<p>As is so often the case, a notable change in an upcoming Linux kernel is both historic and no big deal.</p>
<p>If you wanted to use &#34;Real-Time Linux&#34; for your audio gear, your industrial welding laser, or your Mars rover, you have had that option for a long time (presuming you didn&#39;t want to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX">QNX</a> or other alternatives). Universities started making their own real-time kernels in the late 1990s. A patch set, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PREEMPT_RT">PREEMPT_RT</a>, has existed since at least 2005. And some aspects of the real-time work, like <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/timers/no_hz.html">NO_HZ</a>, were long ago moved into the mainline kernel, enabling its use in data centers, cloud computing, or anything with a lot of CPUs.</p>
<p>But officialness still matters, and in the 6.12 kernel, PREEMPT_RT will <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-rostedt-0159437a?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABDeZFEBhZrUEECmfcOFAF1snC2lzqCrX_k&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BlN9k98ajQf21MqZeP7NF1g%3D%3D">likely be merged into the mainline</a>. As <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/">noted by Steven Vaughan-Nichols at ZDNet</a>, the final sign-off by Linus Torvalds occurred while he was attending Open Source Summit Europe. Torvalds wrote the original code for <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/core-api/printk-basics.html">printk</a>, a debugging tool that can pinpoint exact moments where a process crashes, but also introduces latency that runs counter to real-time computing. The Phoronix blog has tracked the progress of PREEMPT_RT into the kernel, along with <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-NCON-Consoles-v5">the printk changes</a> that allowed for threaded/atomic console support crucial to real-time mainlining.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>What does this mean for desktop Linux? Not much. Beyond high-end audio production or replication (and even <a href="https://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=23459027&amp;cid=64798405">that is debatable</a>), a real-time kernel won&#39;t likely make windows snappier or programs zippier. But the guaranteed execution and worst-case latency timings a real-time Linux provides are quite useful to, say, the systems that monitor car brakes, guide CNC machines, and regulate fiendishly complex multi-CPU systems. Having PREEMPT-RT in the mainline kernel makes it easier to maintain a real-time system, rather than tend to out-of-tree patches.</p>
<p>It will likely change things for what had been, until now, specialty providers of real-time OS solutions for mission-critical systems. Ubuntu, for example, started <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/canonical-announces-real-time-ubuntu-kernal/">offering a real-time version of its distribution</a> in 2023 but required an Ubuntu Pro subscription for access. Ubuntu pitched its release at robotics, automation, embedded Linux, and other real-time needs, with the fixes, patches, module integration, and testing provided by Ubuntu.</p>
<p>&#34;Controlling a laster with Linux is crazy,&#34; Torvalds <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/396997/#link=%7B">said at the Kernel Summit of 2006</a>, &#34;but everyone in this room is crazy in his own way. So if you want to use Linux to control an industrial welding laser, I have no problem with your using PREEMPT_RT.&#34; Roughly 18 years later, Torvalds and the kernel team, including longtime maintainer and champion-of-real-time <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-rostedt-0159437a">Steven Rostedt</a>, have made it even easier to do that kind of thing.</p>
