		<p>I’m not sure what’s going on over in Cupertino for them to think that <em>any</em> of the recent Apple Intelligence ads they’ve been running are a good idea. They’re cringy at best, and honestly just flat out insulting.</p>

<p>In one a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m0MoYKwVTM">schlub writes an email</a> to his boss and uses AI to make it sound ‘more professional’, in another a young woman uses it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPe8revsg3k">lie about remembering an acquaintance’s name</a>. In another the same young woman again uses it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eJy6QyHaFM">lie about reading an email</a> from a college, to her face, while she’s sitting with her. In yet another, <a href="https://blog.blankbaby.com/2024/10/apple-intelligence-smug-and-gross.html">linked to recently by Scott McNulty</a>, a woman uses AI to lie to her husband about getting him something for his birthday.</p>

<p>If this is what Apple thinks their AI is for, I honestly don’t know that I want any part of it.</p>

<p>Compare and contrast with the <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/Scout/">video I posted yesterday</a>, and with this beautiful animation from Canonical.</p>

<p>I’ve watched that little animation several times, and they tell a better story in a minute twenty-five than all of Apple’s AI commercials combined.</p>
