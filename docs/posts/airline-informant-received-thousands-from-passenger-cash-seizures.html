    <h1>Airline informant received thousands from passenger cash seizures</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p>ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - With a single sentence, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/11/21/justice-department-orders-all-consensual-searches-stopped-airports-after-anf-report/" target="_blank">ended a nationwide program</a> that had seized untold millions in cash from airline passengers without arrests.</p><p>“I am directing that the DEA suspend conducting consensual encounters,” wrote Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco in a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/800179012/DOJ-Letter-to-DEA" target="_blank">Nov. 12, 2024, directive</a> to the <a href="https://www.dea.gov/" target="_blank">Drug Enforcement Administration</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/reports/notification-concerns-identified-drug-enforcement-administrations-transportation?utm_source=pressrelease&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=report" target="_blank">directive </a>was an immediate response to a report from the <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/" target="_blank">Justice Department Inspector General </a>that was set in motion by <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/" target="_blank"><b>Atlanta News First Investigates</b></a>. The <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/06/05/wanf-investigates-plane-sight-awarded-celebration-service-america-awards/" target="_blank">award-winning </a>investigation, <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/page/in-plane-sight/" target="_blank"><i><b>In Plane Sight</b></i></a>, has been viewed <a href="https://youtu.be/vXStpsjUAms?si=H1f0BsqKkgRiiZvm" target="_blank">millions of times on YouTube</a>. One of those viewers took action because of it, setting off a chain of events that led the Justice Department to shut the program down.</p><p>Earlier this year, David (who wanted his identity concealed because his employer does business with the government) <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/08/14/new-video-shows-its-nearly-impossible-say-no-dea-searches-airport-gates/" target="_blank">said no to a “consensual search”</a> at the boarding gate for a flight from the Cincinnati Northern Kentucky Airport to New York City.</p><p>David had seen the <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/page/in-plane-sight/" target="_blank"><i><b>Atlanta News First Investigates report </b></i></a>that suggested asking agents, “Am I free to go?,” or “Am I being detained?,” when confronted at airport boarding gates. David said he refused to give consent because of what he saw in the <a href="https://youtu.be/vXStpsjUAms?si=H1f0BsqKkgRiiZvm" target="_blank"><i><b>Atlanta News First Investigates YouTube video</b></i></a>.</p><figure data-video-asset="74e17a2d-c3a3-48ff-a212-107e3fac0f4a"><div><div></div></div></figure><p>A DEA task force officer said David was free to go, but agents would detain his bag. David asked multiple times if he was being detained, and then walked on the plane with his backpack.</p><p>DEA Task Force Officer Nicholas Nimeskern followed David onto the plane and removed his bag without a warrant or probable cause. “So I pulled out my phone and started recording him,” David said. On the video, the officer can be heard saying, “I don’t care about your consent stuff,” when David repeatedly denied the agent’s requests to search his bag.</p><p>Nothing was found inside, but David missed his flight.</p><p>Inspector General report</p><p>The Justice Department Inspector General reopened a decades-long investigation of the Operation Jetway program after seeing David’s video, which was first published by the non-profit <a href="https://ij.org/" target="_blank">Institute for Justice</a>.</p><p>“Without the subject, the individual, thinking to immediately use their cell phone to record the event,” said Inspector General Michael Horowitz, “in fact, we clearly wouldn’t have known about it because absent that video, there was no record of the incident.”</p><p>When the Office of The Inspector General requested records of David’s search, the DEA responded no records existed. “The DEA wasn’t keeping records of its encounters unless it found cash or drugs,” Horowitz said.</p><p>“When we began our investigation and asked for the paperwork, that’s when, months later, they started creating paperwork trying to lay out why they did what they did,” Horowitz added.</p><h3>The secret airline informant</h3><p>As part of its investigation in 2023, <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/" target="_blank"><b>Atlanta News First Investigates </b></a>discovered Transportation Security Administration agents and airline employees received informant fees for tipping off the DEA to passengers likely carrying large amounts of cash.</p><p>Traveling domestically with any amount of currency is legal in the U.S.; only international travelers are required to declare carrying $10,000 or more in currency. David was not carrying a large amount of cash with him on the flight.</p><p>The DOJ Inspector General found out David was stopped because an airline employee paid by the DEA had reported him for buying a last-minute ticket.</p><p>‘It turned out that the individual was getting a percentage of the amount seized on multiple occasions over a longer period of time,” Horowitz said.</p><p>The IG report showed one airline employee “has received tens of thousands of dollars from the DEA over the past several years for seizures resulting from information [they] provided of travelers with tickets purchased within 48 hours of their flight.”</p><p>The Inspector General told <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/" target="_blank"><b>Atlanta News First Investigates </b></a>there was no other evidence of drug trafficking in David’s case, other than his purchase of a last-minute ticket to New York City, where he lives. “Approaching individuals based solely on that basis, without any lead, any other information to suggest they might be a drug courier or money launderer was concerning,” Horowitz said.</p><h3>Sen. Ossoff inquiry</h3><p>A draft of the Inspector General’s report landed on the Attorney General’s desk days before a inquiry from Georgia U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, who <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/11/18/sen-ossoff-demands-answers-dea-after-atlanta-news-first-investigation/" target="_blank">demanded answers </a>after seeing the <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/page/in-plane-sight/" target="_blank"><i><b>Atlanta News First Investigates report </b></i></a>featuring David’s video.</p><p>“It is a scathing description of serious deficiencies in this program that impact the constitutional rights of my constituents in Georgia,” Ossoff said. “And I don’t know whether without reporting from <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/" target="_blank"><b>Atlanta News First</b></a> that would have come to light.”</p><figure><p><a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/newsletter/" rel="" target="_self"><img loading="lazy" src="https://gray-wgcl-prod.gtv-cdn.com/resizer/v2/GTWMO5P7BNHDLHYJAPFL3VHNWA.png?auth=987088ebe85dfb4fd1dc8170b0a689205b2a9dde3a0d3fc3d047a4b655ad5e4b&amp;width=980&amp;height=121&amp;smart=true" width="980" height="121" srcset="https://gray-wgcl-prod.gtv-cdn.com/resizer/v2/GTWMO5P7BNHDLHYJAPFL3VHNWA.png?auth=987088ebe85dfb4fd1dc8170b0a689205b2a9dde3a0d3fc3d047a4b655ad5e4b&amp;width=540&amp;height=66&amp;smart=true 540w, https://gray-wgcl-prod.gtv-cdn.com/resizer/v2/GTWMO5P7BNHDLHYJAPFL3VHNWA.png?auth=987088ebe85dfb4fd1dc8170b0a689205b2a9dde3a0d3fc3d047a4b655ad5e4b&amp;width=720&amp;height=88&amp;smart=true 720w, https://gray-wgcl-prod.gtv-cdn.com/resizer/v2/GTWMO5P7BNHDLHYJAPFL3VHNWA.png?auth=987088ebe85dfb4fd1dc8170b0a689205b2a9dde3a0d3fc3d047a4b655ad5e4b&amp;width=980&amp;height=120&amp;smart=true 980w, https://gray-wgcl-prod.gtv-cdn.com/resizer/v2/GTWMO5P7BNHDLHYJAPFL3VHNWA.png?auth=987088ebe85dfb4fd1dc8170b0a689205b2a9dde3a0d3fc3d047a4b655ad5e4b&amp;width=1300&amp;height=160&amp;smart=true 1300w"/></a></p></figure><p>Ossoff said he particularly concerned with the informant fees paid to airline employees who were alerting the DEA to passengers without any evidence of criminal activity. “If informants are being paid with confiscated property from searches that the informants triggered with no real evidence, it’s obvious why that’s a potential abuse and a potential violation of civil rights,” Ossoff said.</p><h3>Plainclothes agents nowhere to be seen at airport</h3><p>The Nov. 12 directive ordered the immediate suspension of the entire DEA cold consent encounter program nationwide. That directive was revealed publicly only when the Office of Inspector General released its report Nov. 21, 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/" target="_blank"><b>Atlanta News First Investigates </b></a>went to dozens of airport gates in Georgia, Washington, D.C., and Louisiana since the directive was issued, and saw no sign of the plainclothes drug agents previously recorded searching passengers at boarding doors.</p><p>The DOJ directive does allow the DEA to search suspects of drug trafficking “as part of a pre-planned activity in an ongoing, predicated investigation involving one or more identified targets or criminal networks.”</p><div><div><div><div><div><figure><p><img alt="Atlanta News First was honored Tuesday night for its dedication to its community.

For the last several months, DEA has been conducting an internal review of its Transportation Interdiction Program, which has been suspended. That review is ongoing. The DEA is committed to executing our mission with integrity and professionalism at every turn.”</p><p><a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/" target="_blank"><b>Atlanta News First Investigates</b></a> also reached out to Nimeskern through his primary employer, the Montgomery (Ohio) Police Department.</p><p>Police Chief John Crowell responded, “I will check with him, but I doubt he wishes to speak to you.”</p><p><b>If there’s something you would like Atlanta News First Chief Investigator Brendan Keefe to look into, email him directly at </b><a href="mailto:brendan.keefe@wanf.com"><b>brendan.keefe@wanf.com</b></a><b>.</b></p><p><i>Copyright 2024 WANF.
