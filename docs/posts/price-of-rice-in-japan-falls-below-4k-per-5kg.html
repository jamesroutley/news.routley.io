    <h1>Price of rice in Japan falls below ¥4k per 5kg</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                      <p>The average price of rice sold at about 1,000 supermarkets across Japan in the week through June 15 stood at ¥3,920 per 5 kilograms, slipping below ¥4,000 for the first time since the week that ended on March 2, the agriculture ministry said Monday.</p>

<p>The average price was down by ¥256 from the previous week, declining for the 4th straight week and marking the first drop exceeding ¥100 since March 2022, when the ministry started releasing weekly rice prices.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba had aimed to push down rice prices to the ¥3,000-¥4,000 range by as early as mid-June.</p>

<p>The significant drop likely reflected the distribution of government stockpiled rice released under discretionary contracts.</p>

<p>Despite the fall, the average rice price was still ¥1,772 higher than that of a year earlier.</p>

<p>Agriculture minister Shinjiro Koizumi told reporters on Monday that the country has &#34;taken a step forward on a new stage toward curbing abnormally high rice prices.&#34;</p>

<p>He added, however, &#34;Just because the average rice price fell to the ¥3,900 range, it does not mean that we can relax our efforts.&#34;</p>

<p>At the end of last month, major retailers started selling stockpiled rice released under discretionary contracts with the government at around ¥2,000 per 5 kilograms.</p>

<p>The addition of smaller retailers, including smaller supermarkets, to the list of businesses selling the stockpiled rice further boosted the effectiveness of the government&#39;s measures to tackle soaring price prices.</p>
