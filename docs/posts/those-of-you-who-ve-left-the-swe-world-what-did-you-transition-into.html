    <h1>Ask HN: Those of you who&#39;ve left the SWE world, what did you transition into?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>After 13 years in SWE, working for startups, bigger companies, the golden handcuffs, etc, I can finally say that I think I&#39;m finished.</p><p>Right now I&#39;m contracting to stay afloat, maintain flexibility and delve into entrepreneurship, but I truly don&#39;t know what the future holds for me anymore if building my own company doesn&#39;t work out. I have 0 inclination to go back to a 9-5 at a company coding for a living. I&#39;m done. I&#39;ve been an EM, which might arguably be the most miserable position that exists. I&#39;ve been senior/staff at places, and honestly I just don&#39;t enjoy arguing about the structure of software anymore, I&#39;m tired of the personalities, tired of the infantilization of the industry (frankly, it&#39;s embarrassing) but mostly, I just don&#39;t enjoy coding as much as I used to, unless I&#39;m leveraging it to create an asymmetrical amount of value for me ($$$$) which is just not what a full time job is.</p><p>However, I don&#39;t know what to look into as an alternative if I need a full time position once my wife and I start having kids. My strengths revolve around people and strategy. I&#39;ve been considering sales at a tech company because to me, working harder and having an unlimited cap in what I can earn sounds pretty fantastic.</p><p>Would love to hear any kinds of stories or tips from folks</p></div></div></div>
