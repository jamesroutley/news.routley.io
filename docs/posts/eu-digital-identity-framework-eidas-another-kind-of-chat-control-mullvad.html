    <h1>EU Digital Identity framework (eIDAS) another kind of chat control? – Mullvad</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The proposed EU Digital Identity framework (eIDAS) aims to meddle with the process around internet certificates and will undermine the independence and security assurances of the basis for website security:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A certificate contains the website&#39;s identity (name, etc.) and it&#39;s public key for encryption and signing. It is endorsed by trusted organizations that undergo regular audits. This process enables browsers to verify that the website we visit is authentic (thus avoiding &#34;man-in-the-middle&#34; attacks) and establishes an encrypted connection.</li>
	<li>Articles 45 and 45a stipulate that web browsers must recognise a new form of certificate issued by any EU state has , potentially compromising the encryption and most of all trust and overall security of the web.</li>
	<li>This situation bears similarity to the controversy surrounding &#34;chat control,&#34; as it implies that authorities could intermediate all traffic, decrypting communications sent over services using these certificates.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>In summary, eIDAS Article 45 and 45a represent a dangerous intervention in a system that is essential to securing the Internet.</strong></p>

<p>Mullvad is against these proposed articles.</p>

<p><strong>Time perspective:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>8th November – political (trilogue) agreement sign-off</li>
	<li>End of November to mid-December: Council &amp; Parliament votes (both in Committee &amp; Plenary)</li>
</ul>
