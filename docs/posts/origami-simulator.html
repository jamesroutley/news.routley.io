            Move <b>Fold Percent</b> slowly for this pattern to fold correctly!

            When this pattern is triangulated (during the setup of the simulation) it forms many skinny triangles,
            these triangles are very unstable as the pattern folds.

            Allow this pattern to fold, then select <b>Allow User Interaction</b> (Advanced Options right menu) and drag the central vertex
            to pop into into an alternate, inverted configuration.
