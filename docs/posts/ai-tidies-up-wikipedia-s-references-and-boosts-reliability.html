</figure><p>Wikipedia lives and dies by its references, the links to sources that back up information in the online encyclopaedia. But sometimes, those references are flawed — pointing to broken websites, erroneous information or non-reputable sources.</p><p>A study published on 19 October in <i>Nature Machine Intelligence</i><sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup> suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) can help to clean up inaccurate or incomplete reference lists in Wikipedia entries, improving their quality and reliability.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Fabio Petroni at London-based company Samaya AI and his colleagues developed a neural-network-powered system called SIDE, which analyses whether Wikipedia references support the claims they’re associated with, and suggests better alternatives for those that don’t.</p><p>“It might seem ironic to use AI to help with citations, given how ChatGPT notoriously botches and hallucinates citations. But it’s important to remember that there’s a lot more to AI language models than chatbots,” says Noah Giansiracusa, who studies AI at Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts.</p><h2>AI filter</h2><p>SIDE is trained to recognize good references using existing featured Wikipedia articles, which are promoted on the site and receive a lot of attention from editors and moderators.</p><p>It is then able to identify claims within pages that have poor-quality references through its verification system. It can also scan the Internet for reputable sources, and rank options to replace bad citations.</p><p>To put the system to the test, Petroni and his colleagues used SIDE to suggest references for featured Wikipedia articles that it had not seen before. In nearly 50% of cases, SIDE’s top choice for a reference was already cited in the article. For the others, it found alternative references.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>When SIDE’s results were shown to a group of Wikipedia users, 21% preferred the citations found by the AI, 10% preferred the existing citations and 39% did not have a preference.</p><p>The tool could save time for editors and moderators checking the accuracy of Wikipedia entries, but only if it is deployed correctly, says Aleksandra Urman, a computational communication scientist at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. “The system could be useful in flagging those potentially-not-fitting citations,” she says. “But then again, the question really is what the Wikipedia community would find the most useful.”</p><p>Urman points out that the Wikipedia users who tested the SIDE system were twice as likely to prefer neither of the references as they were to prefer the AI-suggested ones. “This would mean that in these cases, they would still go and search for the relevant citation online,” she says.</p>
