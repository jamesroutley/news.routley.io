				<div><p><strong>NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: NNE)</strong> is an emerging, advanced technology-driven nuclear energy company seeking to become a commercially focused, diversified, and vertically integrated company across four business lines: (i) cutting edge portable microreactor technology, (ii) nuclear fuel fabrication, (iii) nuclear fuel transportation and (iv) nuclear industry consulting services. NANO Nuclear believes it is the first portable nuclear microreactor company to be listed publicly in the U.S.</p>
<p>Led by a world-class nuclear engineering team, NANO Nuclear’s products in technical development are <strong>“ZEUS”, a solid core battery reactor</strong>, and <strong>“ODIN”, a low-pressure coolant reactor</strong>, each representing advanced developments in clean energy solutions that are portable, on-demand capable, advanced nuclear microreactors.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Fuel Transportation Inc. (AFT)</strong>, a NANO Nuclear subsidiary, is led by former executives from the largest transportation company in the world aiming to build a North American transportation company that will provide commercial quantities of HALEU fuel to small modular reactors, microreactor companies, national laboratories, military, and DOE programs. Through NANO Nuclear, AFT is the exclusive licensee of a patented high-capacity HALEU fuel transportation basket developed by three major U.S. national nuclear laboratories and funded by the Department of Energy. Assuming development and commercialization, AFT is expected to form part of the only vertically integrated nuclear fuel business of its kind in North America.</p>
<p><strong>HALEU Energy Fuel Inc. (HEF)</strong>, a NANO Nuclear subsidiary, is focusing on the future development of a domestic source for a High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel fabrication pipeline for NANO Nuclear’s own microreactors as well as the broader advanced nuclear reactor industry.</p></div>
