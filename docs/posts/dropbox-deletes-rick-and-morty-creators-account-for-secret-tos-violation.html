<p data-block-key="xi3qp">For once, I have no upcoming public talks scheduled. Now&#39;s a good time to invite me to present or do stand-up comedy at your event or organization, or guest on your podcast, or to give testimony in a legislative or judicial hearing.</p><p data-block-key="5dh56">If your organization or conference is for-profit, I will be much more likely to be able to speak to you if you offer an honorarium.</p><p data-block-key="90gue">For COVID risk reasons, I&#39;m only interested in virtual appearances for the foreseeable future. I <b>could</b> make an exception for events in New York City, or someplace &lt;5 hours&#39; journey by train, if you&#39;re doing serious risk management at your event (e.g., it&#39;s entirely outdoors, or mandatory testing on-arrival every day, things like that).</p><p data-block-key="9qfso">I can speak for five to fifty minutes. I&#39;m particularly interested in paid engagements doing stand-up comedy about the tech industry as entertainment during virtual internal company conferences, or paid engagements discussing management and maintainer skills in open source.</p><p data-block-key="a1vdq">I&#39;m available starting in August 2022. I usually need two months&#39; notice to deliver a new talk (including performing stand-up comedy), and two weeks&#39; notice to speak on a podcast or panel. I need less notice to reprise a talk I&#39;ve already delivered. For topics, check out my <a href="http://changeset.nyc/resources/">consulting resources</a> or my Talks page:</p>
