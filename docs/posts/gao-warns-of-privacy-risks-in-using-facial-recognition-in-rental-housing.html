<p><a name="HSubTitle"></a>Use and Federal Oversight
of Property Technology </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc202780585"></a><a name="HWhyGAODidThisStudy"></a><span>Why GAO Did This Study</span></h3>

<p>Some policymakers have raised questions about the use
of property technology tools in the rental housing market, including their
potential to produce discriminatory or unfair outcomes for renters. GAO was
asked to assess various aspects of property technology use in the rental
housing market. This report examines (1) the use of four selected property
technology tools, (2) their potential benefits and risks for owners and renters,
and (3) federal agencies’ oversight of these tools. </p>

<p>GAO focused on four commonly used types of property technology
tools (see figure). GAO reviewed studies by federal agencies and advocacy and
industry groups; agency guidance and documentation; and rulemakings, legal
cases, and enforcement actions issued in 2019–2024. GAO also interviewed
officials of four federal agencies responsible for enforcing statutes that
address housing discrimination; anticompetitive, unfair, or deceptive acts
affecting commerce; and the use of consumer credit reports; and representatives
of 12 property technology companies, 10 public housing agencies, and nine
advocacy or industry groups (nongeneralizable sample groups, selected for their
expertise in or use of these technologies).</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc202780586"></a><a name="HWhatGAORecommends"></a><span>What GAO Recommends</span></h3>

<p>GAO recommends that HUD provide more specific written
direction to public housing agencies on the use of facial recognition
technology.  </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc202780587"></a><a name="HWhatGAOFound"></a><span>What GAO Found</span><span> </span></h3>

<p>Property technology broadly refers to the use of software,
digital platforms, and other digital tools used in the housing market. Property
owners and renters use these technologies for functions including advertising, touring,
leasing, and financial management of rental housing. These tools may
incorporate computer algorithms and artificial intelligence.</p>

<div>

<p><a name="_Toc202780604">Selected Property
Technology Tools Used in Rental Housing</a> </p>

</div>

<p><img width="480" src="http://tinylogger.com/robbie/d25107196_web_files/image001.jpg"/></p>

<p>Property technology tools used for advertising, tenant
screening, rent-setting, and facial recognition have both benefits and risks.
For example, facial recognition technology can enhance safety, according to
three industry associations and all 10 of the public housing agencies in GAO’s
review. However, these tools also may pose risks related to transparency,
discriminatory outcomes, and privacy. For instance, potential renters may
struggle to understand, and owners to explain, the basis for screening decisions
made by algorithms. Facial recognition systems also might misidentify
individuals from certain demographic groups, and property owners might use
surveillance information without renter consent, according to advocacy groups
GAO interviewed.    </p>

<p>The four federal agencies took several actions to address
these risks. To combat alleged misleading and discriminatory advertising on
rental platforms, agencies pursued legal action and obtained settlements
requiring changes to advertising practices and improved compliance with the
Fair Housing Act. They also took enforcement actions against tenant screening
companies for using inaccurate or outdated data. </p>

<p>However, all 10 public housing agencies stated public
housing agencies would benefit from additional direction on use of facial
recognition technology. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD)
current guidance to these agencies is high-level and does not provide specific
direction on key operational issues, such as managing privacy risks or sharing
data with law enforcement. More detailed written direction could provide public
housing agencies additional clarity on the use of facial recognition technology
and better address tenant privacy concerns. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc202780028"></a><a name="_Toc202780588"></a><a name="Start"></a><span>Letter</span></h2>

</div>

<p>July 10, 2025</p>

<p>The Honorable Elizabeth Warren</p>

<p>The Honorable Maxine Waters</p>

<p>Property owners and renters increasingly rely on property
technology (proptech), which in the rental housing context broadly refers to
software, digital platforms, and other digital tools used for advertising,
leasing, management, and maintenance. These tools may incorporate technologies
such as algorithms and artificial intelligence, including machine learning
models.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""></a></p>

<p>Proptech tools can make it easier for renters to search
for, view, and lease housing, and for owners to manage their units. But some
policymakers have raised questions about the use of these tools and the
potential for discriminatory, unfair, or anticompetitive outcomes for renters.</p>

<p>You asked us to assess various aspects of proptech use in
the rental housing market. This report examines (1)
selected proptech tools available in the rental market, how they are
used, and by whom; (2) the benefits and risks that selected proptech tools
may pose for owners and renters; and (3) steps taken by federal agencies to
oversee these selected proptech tools.</p>

<p>To identify available proptech tools, we reviewed reports
from federal regulators, academics, industry groups, and advocacy organizations
and identified thirty-four tools. We then purposively selected four tools that
incorporate artificial intelligence and are used by owners and renters in the
rental housing process: advertising platforms, tenant screening tools,
rent-setting software, and facial recognition technology.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""></a></p>

<p>For the first two objectives, we interviewed
representatives of five advocacy organizations, four industry associations
(that represent owners and managers), and two organizations participating in
the federal Fair Housing Initiative Program (which seeks to combat housing
discrimination), as well as a nongeneralizable sample of 12 companies that
provided the selected proptech tools. These consisted of three advertising
companies, three tenant screening companies, four facial recognition companies,
and two rent-setting software companies. We also conducted semi-structured
interviews with representatives of a nongeneralizable sample of 10 public
housing agencies (PHA).</p>

<p>For the third objective, we reviewed guidance and
documentation from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the
Department of Justice (DOJ) the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), final rulemakings, federal court
orders, enforcement actions, and relevant advisory opinions issued by these
agencies from 2019 through 2024.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""></a>
We analyzed HUD communications to PHAs regarding use of surveillance technology
and assessed them against relevant federal internal control standards.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""></a></p>

<p>For all three objectives, we reviewed relevant laws,
regulations, agency reports and guidance, and interviewed representatives from
four federal agencies: the CFPB, DOJ, FTC, and HUD.</p>

<p>See appendix I for additional information about our scope
and methodology.</p>

<p>We conducted this performance audit from November 2023 to
July 2025 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings
and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence
obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on
our audit objectives.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc202780029"></a><a name="_Toc202780589">Background</a></h3>

<h4>Federal Agency Enforcement Roles and Responsibilities</h4>

<p>Federal agencies generally do not have a direct role in
monitoring or overseeing the use of proptech tools in the rental housing
market. Instead, several agencies are tasked with enforcing statutes that
broadly address housing discrimination; anticompetitive, unfair, or deceptive
acts affecting commerce; and the use of consumer credit reports. The federal
agencies with oversight and enforcement responsibilities for laws relevant to
selected proptech tools include HUD, FTC, CFPB, and DOJ (see table 1).</p>

<p>Source: GAO analysis of relevant laws applicable to the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Department of Justice (DOJ),
Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD).  |  <span>GAO‑25‑107196</span></p>

<p><sup>a</sup>DOJ may bring Fair Housing Act cases on its
own or based on referral from HUD when HUD finds reasonable cause, issues a
charge of discrimination, and a party elects to proceed in federal court.</p>

<p><sup>b</sup>On February 9, 2025, the National Treasury
Employees Union and others filed a lawsuit in the District Court for the
District of Columbia alleging that the actions of the Acting Director,
including actions regarding staffing and enforcement work, violated the
Administrative Procedure Act and the Dodd-Frank Consumer Protection and Wall
Street Reform Act and were unconstitutional because they interfered with
Congress’ ability to appropriate funds and create statutory functions for
agencies. Nat’l Treasury Emp. Union, et al. v. Vought, No. 1:25-cv-00381
(D.D.C. filed Feb. 9, 2025). As of May 2025, the litigation is active and
continues in both US Circuit and Appeals Court.</p>

<p><sup>c</sup>FTC and CFPB share enforcement of the Fair
Credit Reporting Act as it applies to tenant screening, which is coordinated
under a memorandum of understanding. DOJ may assist or supervise related
federal court cases.</p>

<p>More specifically, HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal
Opportunity is responsible for enforcing the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits
discrimination in nearly all housing and housing-related transactions based on
protected characteristics.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""></a>
This office issues guidance to assist owners and companies in complying with
Fair Housing Act requirements. It also processes and investigates complaints
alleging civil rights violations and conducts compliance reviews of HUD funding
recipients. After a complaint is filed, HUD attempts to conciliate the matter
before issuing a charge or dismissal.</p>

<p>If conciliation fails, HUD may refer the matter to DOJ.
DOJ may bring a case in federal court if HUD investigated the complaint or
issued a charge and one of the parties elected to proceed in court. In fair
housing cases, DOJ can seek injunctive relief—such as training and policy
changes—monetary damages, and civil penalties in pattern or practice cases.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""></a></p>

<p>FTC and CFPB enforce the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA),
including oversight of consumer reporting agencies.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""></a> These agencies assemble or evaluate
consumer information—such as employment, criminal, rental, eviction, and credit
history—into consumer reports provided to third parties, including rental
property owners who use them to determine eligibility for rental housing. Both FTC
and CFBP can investigate and initiate enforcement action against consumer
reporting agencies that violate FCRA requirements, such as those for ensuring
accuracy.</p>

<p>In addition to enforcement, FTC and CFPB seek input from
and publish resources for the public.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""></a>
Both CFPB and FTC can bring actions for alleged FCRA violations.  FTC can seek
injunctive relieve on its own but must seek civil penalties through DOJ in
federal district court.  CFPB can bring its own cases alleging FCRA violations
for civil penalties and injunctive or other relief. </p>

<p>FTC enforces Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits
unfair methods of competition or deceptive acts or practices affecting
commerce.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""></a>
Under this authority, FTC may investigate and initiate enforcement actions if
it has reason to believe a violation occurred or is occurring. The FTC Act
allows the agency to seek cease-and-desist orders or injunctive relief, impose
civil penalties for violations of its orders or certain rules, and obtain
consumer redress in certain circumstances.</p>

<h4>HUD Administration and Oversight of Subsidized Housing</h4>

<p>In addition to enforcing the Fair Housing Act, HUD plays a
role in administering and overseeing subsidized housing programs.</p>

<p><b>Office of Public and Indian Housing.</b> This office
administers the Public Housing and Housing Choice Voucher programs, two of HUD’s
largest subsidized housing programs.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""></a>
PHAs—typically municipal, county, or state agencies created under state
law—operate both programs. Under the Public Housing program, HUD provides
subsidies to PHAs, which own and operate rental housing designated for eligible
low-income households. Under the Housing Choice Voucher program, HUD provides
rental subsidies, through PHAs, that renters can use to obtain housing in the
private market.</p>

<p><b>Office of Policy Development and Research.</b> This
office develops fair market rents, which are used to determine the maximum
allowable rent for Housing Choice Voucher recipients. Fair market rent
generally reflects the cost of renting a moderately priced unit in a local
housing market. HUD calculates and publishes these rents annually for thousands
of locations.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc202780030"></a><a name="_Toc202780590">Owners and Renters Use
Proptech Tools for Listing, Searching, Screening, and Rent-Setting</a></h3>

<p>Owners and renters may use one or more of the four types
of proptech tools we reviewed—advertising platforms, tenant screening tools,
rent-setting software, and facial recognition technology—for functions
including advertising, rent-setting, screening tenants, and controlling access.</p>

<p><b>Advertising platforms.</b> These platforms allow owners
to list rental properties on websites for prospective renters to view (see fig.
1). Features may include targeted advertising, virtual touring, and rent
estimates. Algorithms and machine learning may be used to personalize search
results by tailoring recommendations based on user data. Other platform
features may include rental-management tools for landlords, such as application
intake, tenant screening, electronic lease signing, and rent collection.</p>

</div>

<p><img width="479" src="http://tinylogger.com/robbie/d25107196_web_files/image002.jpg"/></p>

<p><b>Tenant screening tools.</b> Property owners use tenant
screening tools to assess the suitability of prospective renters for a rental
unit (see fig. 2). The tools assemble and evaluate tenant background
information such as credit and criminal history, employment and income verification,
and rental payment or eviction history to generate a screening report. Owners
may use these reports to attempt to evaluate an applicant’s likelihood of
fulfilling lease obligations.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""></a>
Some tools use machine learning to analyze patterns in applicant data to
attempt to predict a prospective renter’s reliability based on historical
trends. These predictions may be presented as a score or recommendation that
owners consider when deciding whether to approve an applicant.</p>

<p><img width="479" id="Picture 2" src="http://tinylogger.com/robbie/d25107196_web_files/image003.jpg"/></p>

<p><b>Rent-setting software.</b> Also known as revenue
management software, these tools help property owners determine rents by
generating data-driven pricing recommendations (see fig. 3). They may use
proprietary or public data, such as occupancy rates, market trends, and
comparable unit prices. This tool may also apply artificial intelligence
techniques, including machine learning, to forecast demand and suggest optimal
rental levels. The software allows owners to adjust rents in response to
current market conditions and their own pricing objectives.</p>

<p><img width="479" id="Picture 3" src="http://tinylogger.com/robbie/d25107196_web_files/image004.jpg"/></p>

<p><b>Facial recognition technology.</b> Building owners use
facial recognition technology for security, including access control (see fig.
4). For example, cameras installed at building entrances use software to verify
a renter’s identity by comparing their face to a database of stored images. A
successful match allows entry. The software uses computer vision, a type of
artificial intelligence, to recognize faces in real time, verify identities
from images, and improve accuracy over time through learning.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc202780031"></a><a name="_Toc202780591">Selected Proptech Tools
Can Offer Convenience and Safety but Also Pose Privacy, Bias, and Other Risks</a></h3>

<h4>Online Listing Platforms Can Benefit Owners and Renters but Carry Risks
Such as Misrepresentation</h4>

<p>Online listing platforms can provide several benefits for
owners and renters, according to the industry associations and advertising
companies we interviewed, including the following:</p>

<p><b>Wider advertising reach.</b> Owners can use third-party
advertising features to extend the visibility of their listings across multiple
platforms. These tools use algorithms to target potential renters more
efficiently than traditional print advertising. They also can save owners time
by creating one listing that can be displayed across various websites and
social medial platforms. Broader exposure can help fill vacancies more quickly
and maximize rental income.</p>

<p><b>Convenience and cost savings of virtual tours.</b>
Listing platforms allow potential renters to take virtual tours—often in
three-dimensional formats—that show a unit’s floor layout. Virtual touring is
available at any time and may reduce travel and other costs. It also helps
individuals with mobility or accessibility limitations assess whether a unit
meets their needs without having to physically be present at the unit.</p>

<p><b>Cost savings and efficiencies from universal
applications.</b> One company with which we spoke offers “universal” rental
applications for potential renters and property owners. The service is free for
owners who accept the application. Prospective renters submit a single form and
pay one fee to apply to multiple units over a 30-day period.</p>

<p>However, representatives of advocacy groups and officials
from federal agencies we interviewed noted that advertising tools posed
potential risks to renters, including potential misrepresentation and
discrimination.</p>

<p><b>Misrepresentation of listings or costs.</b> Owners may
post fraudulent or misleading images, including altered or staged photographs.
For example, potential renters may rely on pictures and videos provided in a
virtual tour, but owners could manipulate these images to make rooms appear
larger or smaller than they are. Owners also may make unclear statements about
rent costs. For example, rent may be advertised online in a way that obscures
actual costs, or fees for amenities like gyms or conference rooms may be hidden
until move-in.</p>

<p><b>Discriminatory advertising.</b> Platforms or owners may
limit who sees listings or include language that discourages renters on a
prohibited basis, such as by protected classes. For example, phrases such as “no
children” or “no wheelchairs” may violate the Fair Housing Act by
discriminating on the basis of familial status or disability. Unlike
traditional print advertising, where a listing is provided in writing and a
landlord subsequently assesses applicants, algorithms may analyze characteristics
such as income or location and steer certain users to or from specific listings
before they can apply. This practice may reduce housing access for minorities,
women, families with children, and individuals with disabilities.</p>

<p>Online platforms use several approaches to help mitigate
these risks, according to representatives from one of the three advertising
companies we interviewed. For example, this company said its platform includes
a rental cost and fee calculator that helps potential renters understand the
full cost of a unit. The tool lists associated fees and expenses, such as
monthly costs for utilities, parking, and pet fees, as well as one-time charges
like security deposits and application or administrative fees. This company
described a set of controls designed to prevent discriminatory advertising.
These include keyword detection logic to filter potentially discriminatory
language—for instance, blocking phrases that discourage families with children.
The platform also displays information about relevant federal, state, and local
fair housing laws to owners before they upload a listing. In addition, the
website allows users to report potential discriminatory content for manual
review by the company.</p>

<h4>Screening Technology Can Help Owners Manage Risks, but Inaccurate
Information May Result Denials</h4>

<p>According to industry associations, and representatives
from two companies we interviewed, owners benefit from tenant screening tools
in part because they help mitigate renter-based risks, including the following:</p>

<p><b>Failure to meet lease obligations</b>. Screening tools
may help owners assess background information to reduce the risk a renter might
not fulfill lease terms. For example, reviewing a prospective renter’s rent
payment and credit history may help owners identify applicants with a lower
risk of nonpayment. </p>

<p><b>Fraud risks.</b> Screening algorithms assist owners in
verifying information that potential renters provide. This verification helps
reduce risks of identity fraud (false names, Social Security numbers, or birth
dates) and synthetic fraud (fabricated documents, such as pay stubs).</p>

<p>Potential risks and challenges related to using screening
reports include the following:</p>

<p><b>Inaccurate information.</b> Tenant screening reports
often contain inaccurate information, which can lead to unwarranted rental
application denials. For example, of the approximately 26,700 screening-related
complaints submitted to CFPB from January 2019 to September 2022, approximately
17,200 were related to inaccurate information.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""></a>
Specifically, these complaints noted challenges obtaining housing—for instance,
due to information erroneously included in their report; outdated information
that legally should not have been included; and inaccurate arrest, criminal,
and eviction records.</p>

<p><b>Model transparency issues.</b> As we previously
reported, models using algorithms can produce unreliable and invalid results.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""></a> Advocacy groups noted that
algorithms may present a recommendation to the owner without disclosing the
specific data used or how it was weighted. As a result, owners and renters may
be unable to identify or correct errors, and renters may be unable to submit
mitigating information to improve their chances of securing housing.</p>

<p><b>Disparate impact.</b> Screening algorithms that rely on
criminal history and eviction records may have an adverse impact on minorities,
including Black and Hispanic applicants, according to advocacy group officials.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""></a> For example, algorithms that
recommend rejecting applicants with any criminal or eviction record may
disproportionately affect these groups due to their overrepresentation in the
criminal justice and housing court systems. This may contribute to reduced
housing access and increased housing instability. In addition, algorithms may
not differentiate between serious offenses and minor ones that are unlikely to
affect renter’s reliability.</p>

<p>Representatives of tenant screening companies we
interviewed reported taking several steps to help mitigate these risks. For
example, one company allows potential renters to review their background
information and submit comments to the owner before applying. Renters can flag
inaccuracies or provide a narrative to explain circumstances the owner might
otherwise overlook. In addition, three companies told us they review and
subsequently correct inaccurate information on a tenant screening report if
notified by a renter or owner.</p>

<h4>Rent-Setting Algorithms Offer Owners Pricing Insights but May Lead to
Higher Rents</h4>

<p>Representatives from two industry associations, HUD
officials, and representatives from one company offering rent-setting software
noted that owners and renters may benefit from the use of tools that provide
rent-setting algorithms in several ways, including the following:</p>

<p><b>Responsiveness to market changes.</b> Rent-setting
algorithms may help owners adjust rents more quickly in response to changing
market conditions. This can help owners achieve their desired occupancy rates,
keep their properties at their desired level relative to the market, and
minimize revenue lost from unintended vacancies.</p>

<p><b>Improved accuracy in HUD fair market rents</b>. HUD
incorporates data from private market sources that includes a rent-setting tool
to enhance the accuracy and representativeness of its fair market rent
calculations.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""></a>
According to HUD officials, incorporating private-market data helps address
gaps in public data sources, such as census data, which may be outdated or lack
coverage in certain markets. HUD officials stated that more accurate and timely
fair market rent calculations can help renters with Housing Choice Vouchers
find suitable, affordable housing.</p>

<p>However, representatives of advocacy groups also told us
that renters face several risks when owners use rent-setting algorithms,
including the following:</p>

<p><b>Reduced bargaining power.</b> When owners rely on
rent-setting algorithms to standardize rental prices across a geographic
market, advertised rents may increase and renters may have less ability to
negotiate lower prices. Algorithms may recommend rents that owners treat as a
market benchmark, limiting flexibility to lower prices, even when individual
renters attempt to negotiate. Advocacy groups expressed concern that this
effect is especially pronounced in tight housing markets, where limited supply
further constrains renters’ leverage.</p>

<p><b>Potential increases in rental housing costs.</b>
According to University of Pennsylvania researchers, owners using rent-setting
software adjusted rents more responsively to changing market conditions compared
to other property owners.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""></a>
This included increasing rents and reducing occupancy rates during periods of
economic growth.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""></a> Moreover,
this pattern was also found at the geographic level when, during periods of
economic growth, higher levels of rent-setting software were associated with
higher rent levels and lower occupancy rates. Advocacy groups we spoke to
reiterated these findings, noting that dependent on market conditions, the use
of a rent-setting algorithm can lead to higher rents for some renters. </p>

<h4>Facial Recognition Technology Can Enhance Security but Pose Privacy Risks</h4>

<p>Representatives from three of the four industry
associations and all 10 of the PHAs we spoke to told us that the use of facial
recognition technology can enhance safety for both private and subsidized
rental housing. Owners and PHAs may install surveillance cameras equipped with
facial recognition technology to improve property security. Industry
association and PHA officials overseeing properties with such technology told
us that it can enhance safety by helping ensure that only renters and their
authorized guests can enter buildings. They noted that the technology may
reduce the risk of unauthorized individuals entering public housing facilities
and engaging in criminal activity.</p>

<p>However, representatives from advocacy organizations we
interviewed raised concerns about the use of facial recognition technology in
rental housing, citing risks related to accuracy, privacy, and informed
consent.</p>

<p><b>Error rates.</b> Advocacy groups we interviewed
expressed concerns about facial recognition technology’s higher error rates for
identifying and verifying individuals from certain demographics—particularly
Black women. In the rental housing context, such inaccuracies could result in
frequent access denials for some individuals.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""></a>
Representatives of facial recognition companies cited several factors that may
contribute to these errors, including poor lighting, facial expressions, and
obscured facial features. They also noted that data quality—including outdated
or low-resolution images used for comparison—may also affect accuracy.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""></a></p>

<p><b>Privacy and consent.</b> Facial recognition technology
relies on the use of biometric information, which is unique to each person.
Representatives from advocacy groups we interviewed expressed concern that
surveillance data collected by owners could be used without renter consent. For
example, owners could share this information with law enforcement or use it for
action against a renter, such as an eviction or fine. Additionally,
representatives of 6 of the ten PHAs we interviewed expressed uncertainty about
what steps they should take to obtain consent when using facial recognition
technology as part of their housing operations.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc202780032"></a><a name="_Toc202780592">Federal Agencies
Addressed Some Proptech Risks, but HUD Could Further Mitigate Risks</a></h3>

<p>Federal agencies took several actions to address risks
related to selected proptech tools.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""></a>
However, HUD has opportunities to further mitigate risks related to facial
recognition technology in public housing.</p>

<h4>Agencies Took Steps to Address Allegedly Misleading and Discriminatory
Advertising Practices</h4>

<p>To address potential risks associated with online listing
platforms—specifically, misleading advertisements and discriminatory
advertising—FTC, HUD, and DOJ initiated legal actions and HUD issued guidance.</p>

<p><b>Misleading advertisements.</b> In 2022, FTC initiated a
lawsuit against Roomster, a platform for rental housing and roommate listings.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""></a> FTC alleged that the company
participated in deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5 of the
FTC Act because its website contained inaccurate rental listings and misleading
or fake consumer reviews. A federal court issued a stipulated order requiring
the company to stop misrepresenting its listings, investigate any consumer
complaints, and pay a fine.</p>

<p><b>Discriminatory advertising practices.</b> In March
2019, following a complaint and investigation, HUD issued a Charge of
Discrimination against Meta alleging that its advertising platform violated the
Fair Housing Act by allowing advertisers to target or exclude users based on
protected characteristics. For example, Meta’s platform included a toggle
feature that allowed advertisers to exclude men or women from viewing an
advertisement.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""></a></p>

<p>The case was referred to DOJ, which filed suit in in 2022.
DOJ alleged that Meta’s advertising delivery system used algorithms that
considered traits such as familial status, race, religion, and sex.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""></a> As part of the settlement, Meta
agreed to stop using an advertising tool known as the Special Audience Tool,
develop a new system that would address racial and other disparities caused by
its use of personalization algorithms in its advertisement delivery system for
housing, and eliminate targeting options related to protected characteristics
under the Fair Housing Act. </p>

<p>In April 2024, HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal
Opportunity issued guidance outlining advertising practices that may violate
the Fair Housing Act when used to categorize or target online users.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""></a> These include advertisements that
discourage certain groups from applying, offer different prices or conditions
based on protected characteristics, or steer individuals toward specific
neighborhoods. The guidance advised housing providers to avoid targeting
options that directly or indirectly relate to protected characteristics. It
also encouraged platforms to test their systems to ensure advertisements are
not delivered in a discriminatory fashion.</p>

<h4>Agencies Took Enforcement and Other Actions to Address Tenant Screening and
Reporting Issues</h4>

<p>Federal agencies have taken steps to address issues
related to the accuracy and potential adverse impact of tenant screening tools.
These steps include issuing guidance, taking enforcement actions and filing a
statement of interest.</p>

<p><b>Guidance on Tenant Screening Tools.</b> Also in April
2024, HUD issued guidance on applying the Fair Housing Act to screening of
rental housing applicants.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""></a>
HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity published the guidance on
its public website. The guidance also addressed the application of the Fair
Housing Act to tenant screening processes that use artificial intelligence and
machine learning. It included best practices for rental housing owners and
tenant screening companies to support compliance with fair housing laws and
mitigate artificial intelligence-related and other risks. To address inaccuracy
risks, the guidance recommended that owners give applicants an opportunity to
dispute the accuracy or relevance of negative information in a tenant screening
report. To improve transparency, it advised tenant screening companies to
include all relevant information behind a denial decision, particularly when
artificial intelligence tools are used and the outcome may be difficult to
explain. In February 2025, we observed that HUD had removed the tenant
screening guidance from its public website. HUD provided two explanations for
the removal: (1) In March 2025, HUD officials told us the guidance was taken
down as part of an agencywide review of its policies and guidance to ensure
consistency with an executive order; and (2) in March 2025, HUD told us the
agency was updating its website and the guidance remained in effect.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""></a></p>

<p><b>AppFolio.</b> In December 2020, DOJ and FTC, sued
AppFolio, Inc. a tenant screening company, for violating FCRA. The complaint
alleged that the company used incorrect and obsolete eviction and criminal
arrest records—some more than 7 years old—in its tenant screening reports.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""></a> The agencies also alleged the
company failed to use reasonable procedures for accuracy, relying on
third-party data without sufficient verification. As part of the settlement,
the company agreed to pay a fine and implement corrective measures to improve
its accuracy procedures.</p>

<p><b>TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions.</b> In October
2023, FTC and CFPB jointly sued TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions and its
parent company for violating FCRA.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""></a>
The agencies alleged the company failed to follow reasonable procedures to
ensure maximum possible accuracy of report content, including reporting sealed
or incorrect eviction records, and did not disclose the sources of third-party
information when requested by consumers. The stipulated settlements filed with
the complaint in October 2023 required the company to enhance its procedures to
ensure maximum possible accuracy for verifying eviction data and to pay
consumer redress and a civil penalty.</p>

<p><b>Five background screening companies.</b> In September
2023, FTC initiated an enforcement action against five background screening
companies that advertised tenant screening reports (among other things),
alleging violations of FCRA and Section 5 of the FTC Act.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""></a> FTC alleged that the companies
inaccurately reported nonexistent or irrelevant criminal records—such as
traffic violations—and allowed subscribers to edit their reports without
adequate verification. In October 2023, a federal court entered a stipulated
order that required the companies to cease certain practices unless they
implemented compliance measures aligned with FCRA.</p>

<p><b>Statement of interest.</b> In January 2023, DOJ and HUD
submitted a statement of interest in the federal court case <i>Louis et al. v.
SafeRent Solutions and Metropolitan Management Group</i>.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""></a> In the case, the two plaintiffs were
Black rental applicants who used housing vouchers and alleged that SafeRent’s
algorithm-based tenant screening tool assigned them low “SafeRent” scores,
resulting in the denial of their rental applications. The plaintiffs also
alleged that the tool disproportionately affected Black and Hispanic applicants
by relying on factors such as credit history and non-housing-related debts,
while failing to account for of housing vouchers as a reliable source of
income. The agencies asserted that the Fair Housing Act applies to tenant
screening companies that provide data used by housing owners to make
suitability determinations. Accordingly, DOJ and HUD stated that such companies
are prohibited from engaging in practices that result in discrimination based
on protected characteristics.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""></a>
In December 2024, the court approved a settlement between SafeRent, the other
defendants, and the class of plaintiffs, and the case was subsequently
dismissed.</p>

<h4>HUD Has Opportunities to Further Mitigate Risks Relating to Facial
Recognition</h4>

<p>In September 2023, HUD’s Office of Public and Indian
Housing published a letter advising PHAs to balance security concerns with
their public housing residents’ privacy rights when using surveillance
technology.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""></a>
However, the letter does not provide specific direction on key operational
issues regarding facial recognition technology. For example, it does not
discuss how PHAs should manage privacy risks or share data with law
enforcement.</p>

<p>Representatives of all 10 PHAs we interviewed stated they
would benefit from additional information and direction from HUD on their use
of facial recognition technology, especially on the following topics:</p>

<p><span>·<span>       </span></span><b>Purpose
specification.</b> Six of the 10 PHAs wanted HUD to clarify the permitted uses
of facial recognition technology. While they primarily use it to control
building access for tenants and their authorized guests, they expressed
interest in guidance on other potential uses, such as whether and how to
disclose data to third parties, including law enforcement.</p>

<p><span>·<span>       </span></span><b>Renter
consent.</b> Six of the 10 PHAs wanted guidance on what constitutes adequate
renter consent. For example, they questioned whether posting signs about the
use of facial recognition systems was sufficient. They also sought clarity on
whether written consent is required before including tenant facial images in
system databases, and what steps to take if a renter declined to provide
consent.</p>

<p><span>·<span>       </span></span><b>Data
management.</b> Five of the 10 PHAs wanted guidance on managing data collected
through facial recognition systems. For example, they sought clarity on how
long to retain images after a tenant moved out.</p>

<p><span>·<span>       </span></span><b>Accuracy.</b>
One PHA wanted HUD to provide guidance on mitigating potential accuracy
concerns.</p>

<p>HUD officials stated the agency has no plans to revise the
September 2023 letter or issue additional written direction on facial
recognition technology, citing the need to preserve PHAs’ autonomy in
implementing it. However, as discussed earlier, representatives of six PHAs we
interviewed expressed uncertainty about what steps they should take to obtain
consent when using facial recognition technology as part of their housing
operations.</p>

<p>HUD officials also stated that developing new guidance
would require surveying about 3,300 PHAs to identify their information gaps,
straining limited resources. However, the risks of facial recognition
technology are well documented. For example, we have previously reported on
concerns related to accuracy and the use of the technology without an
individual’s consent.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""></a>
As a result, we believe HUD could develop written direction for PHAs without
the use of a survey.</p>

<p>According to federal internal control standards, program
managers should externally communicate the necessary quality information to
achieve the entity’s objectives.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""></a>
By providing additional direction on use of facial recognition technology, HUD
could help PHAs it oversees mitigate privacy and accuracy concerns and offer
clarity on key issues such as purpose, consent, and data management.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc202780033"></a><a name="_Toc202780593">Conclusions</a></h3>

<p>The selected proptech tools we reviewed offer benefits to
individuals searching for, living in, or owning or managing rental properties.
However, they also can pose risks—particularly related to the accuracy of
personal information and the potential for misrepresentation and
discrimination. Federal agencies took steps to address these risks, but HUD has
opportunities to further support PHAs it oversees. Providing additional written
direction on the appropriate use of facial recognition technology would give
PHAs greater clarity and help mitigate privacy and accuracy concerns.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc202780034"></a><a name="_Toc202780594">Recommendation for
Executive Action</a></h3>

<p>The Secretary of HUD should ensure that the Assistant
Secretary for Public and Indian Housing provides additional written direction
to public housing agencies on the use of facial recognition technology. For
example, this direction could specify permitted uses of the technology, define
what constitutes renter consent, and address data management and accuracy
concerns.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc202780035"></a><a name="_Toc202780595">Agency Comments</a></h3>

<p>We provided a draft of this report to HUD, CFPB, FTC, and
DOJ for review and comment. These agencies provided technical comments, which
we incorporated as appropriate. </p>

<p>As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce
the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30
days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate

<h2><a name="_Toc202780036"></a><a name="_Toc202780596">Appendix I: Objectives,
Scope, and Methodology</a></h2>

</div>

<p>This report examines (1) selected property
technology (proptech) tools available in the rental housing market, how
they are used, and by whom; (2) the benefits and risks that
selected proptech tools may pose for owners and renters; and (3)
steps taken by federal agencies to oversee these selected proptech tools.</p>

<p>We identified thirty four proptech tools through a review
of reports from federal regulators, academics, industry groups, and advocacy
groups. We focused on tools that incorporate artificial intelligence and are
used by owners and renters in the rental housing process. We purposively
selected four types of proptech tools for examination: advertising platforms,
tenant screening tools, rent-setting software, and facial recognition
technology. These tools are not representative of all proptech tools used in the
private and subsidized rental housing markets.</p>

<p>To gather information on owner and renter use of the
selected proptech tools—and the associated benefits and risks—we interviewed
representatives of a purposeful, nongeneralizable sample of 12 companies that
provide such tools. These consisted of three advertising companies, three
tenant screening companies, four facial recognition companies, and two
rent-setting software companies. To identify these companies, we reviewed
research reports, and publicly available lists of firms offering the selected
tools to generate a list of companies. From that list, we selected companies
that offered one or more of the tools and were responsive to our outreach. The
information obtained from these interviews cannot be generalized to all
companies that offer proptech tools in the private and subsidized rental
housing markets.</p>

<p>In addition, we interviewed representatives from four
industry associations and five advocacy organizations, selected because they
published reports from 2019 to 2024 about the selected tools.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""></a> We also interviewed officials from
two organizations funded by the Fair Housing Initiative Program, a federal
program designed to assist people who believe they have been victims of housing
discrimination.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""></a>
We selected the two organizations because they work directly with renters, are
in the metropolitan area with the largest number of public housing units based
on Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) data and were recipients
of HUD Fair Housing Initiative Program grants within the past 2 years.</p>

<p>To understand the use of and benefits and risks of the
selected proptech tools in the subsidized housing market, we conducted
semi-structured interviews with representatives of a nongeneralizable sample of
10 public housing agencies (PHA). We selected these PHAs to achieve a diversity
in PHA size, Census region, and use of facial recognition technology. The
information we gathered from these interviews cannot be generalized to the
approximately 3300 PHAs.</p>

<p>To identify steps taken by federal agencies to oversee the
selected proptech tools, we reviewed agency guidance, final rulemakings,
federal court orders, agency enforcement actions, and relevant advisory
opinions issued from 2019 through 2024. We analyzed relevant HUD documentation
and interviewed HUD and selected PHA officials on HUD efforts to communicate to
PHAs on the use of surveillance technology in their operations. We also
compared a HUD communication to PHAs about using surveillance technology in their
operations against federal internal control standards.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""></a> We determined that the internal
control principle that program managers should externally communicate the
necessary quality information to achieve the entity’s objectives was
significant to this objective.</p>

<p>To address all three objectives, we also reviewed relevant
laws, including the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, and the Sherman Antitrust Act. We also reviewed
relevant regulations, such as HUD’s regulation on discriminatory advertising. In
addition, we interviewed representatives from the following federal agencies:
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Department of Justice, Federal Trade
Commission, and HUD. Within HUD, we interviewed officials from the Office of
Public and Indian Housing, Office of Multifamily Housing, Office of Policy
Development and Research, and Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""></a></p>

<p>We conducted this performance audit from November 2023 to
July 2025 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings
and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence
obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on
our audit objectives.</p>

  restricted from public access. Each adverse item is also subject to its own
  reporting period. For example, a criminal charge that did not result in a
  conviction generally cannot be reported more than 7 years after the date of
  the charge. CFPB withdrew this guidance on May 12, 2025. </p>

  <p>In January 2024, CFPB issued an advisory opinion on
  file disclosures.<sup>d</sup> The opinion underscores that under FCRA,
  consumers have the right to request and obtain all information in their
  consumer file at the time of request. The opinion explains how consumer
  reporting agencies must fulfill this request even if the consumer does not
  explicitly ask for a “complete file” and also must disclose the sources used
  to generate the report. CFPB withdrew this guidance on May 12, 2025. </p>
