<p>The ubiquitous ESP32 microchip made by Chinese manufacturer Espressif and used by over 1 billion units as of 2023 contains an undocumented backdoor that could be leveraged for attacks.</p>

<p>The undocumented commands allow spoofing of trusted devices, unauthorized data access, pivoting to other devices on the network, and potentially establishing long-term persistence.</p>

<p>This was discovered by Spanish researchers Miguel Tarascó Acuña and Antonio Vázquez Blanco of Tarlogic Security, who <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25554812-2025-rootedcon-bluetoothtools/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">presented</a> their findings yesterday at <a href="https://reg.rootedcon.com/cfp/schedule/talk/5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">RootedCON</a> in Madrid.</p>

<p>The researchers warned that ESP32 is one of the world&#39;s most widely used chips for Wi-Fi + Bluetooth connectivity in IoT (Internet of Things) devices, so the risk of any backdoor in them is significant.</p>

<h2>Discovering a backdoor in ESP32</h2>

<p>In their RootedCON presentation, the Tarlogic researchers explained that interest in Bluetooth security research has waned but not because the protocol or its implementation has become more secure.</p>

<p>Instead, most attacks presented last year didn&#39;t have working tools, didn&#39;t work with generic hardware, and used outdated/unmaintained tools largely incompatible with modern systems.</p>

<p>Tarlogic developed a new C-based USB Bluetooth driver that is hardware-independent and cross-platform, allowing direct access to the hardware without relying on OS-specific APIs.</p>

<p>Armed with this new tool, which enables raw access to Bluetooth traffic, Targolic discovered hidden vendor-specific commands (Opcode 0x3F) in the ESP32 Bluetooth firmware that allow low-level control over Bluetooth functions.</p>

<p>In total, they found 29 undocumented commands, collectively characterized as a &#34;backdoor,&#34; that could be used for memory manipulation (read/write RAM and Flash), MAC address spoofing (device impersonation), and LMP/LLCP packet injection.</p>

<p>Espressif has not publicly documented these commands, so either they weren&#39;t meant to be accessible, or they were left in by mistake.</p>

<p>The risks arising from these commands include malicious implementations on the OEM level and supply chain attacks.</p>

<p>Depending on how Bluetooth stacks handle HCI commands on the device, remote exploitation of the backdoor might be possible via malicious firmware or rogue Bluetooth connections.</p>

<p>This is especially the case if an attacker already has root access, planted malware, or pushed a malicious update on the device that opens up low-level access.</p>

<p>In general, though, physical access to the device&#39;s USB or UART interface would be far riskier and a more realistic attack scenario.</p>

<p>&#34;In a context where you can compromise an IOT device with as ESP32 you will be able to hide an APT inside the ESP memory and perform Bluetooth (or Wi-Fi) attacks against other devices, while controlling the device over Wi-Fi/Bluetooth,&#34; explained the researchers to BleepingComputer.</p>

<p>&#34;Our findings would allow to fully take control over the ESP32 chips and to gain persistence in the chip via commands that allow for RAM and Flash modification.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Also, with persistence in the chip, it may be possible to spread to other devices because the ESP32 allows for the execution of advanced Bluetooth attacks.&#34;</p>

<p>BleepingComputer has contacted Espressif for a statement on the researchers&#39; findings, but a comment wasn&#39;t immediately available.</p>
