                                    <p>The purpose of this article is to plot a fascinating story in the history of mathematics. The 4000-year-old story of Pythagoras and his famous theorem is worthy of recounting – even for the math-phobic readership. It is more than a <i>math</i> story, as it tells a history of two great civilizations of antiquity rising to prominence 4000 years ago, along with historic and legendary persons, who not only define the period, but whose individual life stories are quite engaging. Moreover, the theorem seemingly has no ending, as every year students, academicians and problem solvers with a mathematical bent tackle the theorem in an attempt to add new and innovative proofs. In addition, a 350-year-old generalized version of the Pythagorean Theorem, which was proposed by an amateur mathematician, was finally solved, and made the front-page of the <i>New York Times</i> in 1993.</p><section data-title="BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF PYTHAGORAS"><div id="Sec1-section"><h2 id="Sec1">BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF PYTHAGORAS</h2><div id="Sec1-content"><p>The Greek mathematician Pythagoras has high name recognition, not only in the history of mathematics. Everyone who has studied geometry can recall, well after the high school years, some aspect of the Pythagorean Theorem. However, the story of Pythagoras and his famous theorem is not well known. Some story plot points are: the famous theorem goes by several names grounded in the behavior of the day (discussed later in the text), including the Pythagorean Theorem, Pythagoras’ Theorem and notably Euclid I 47. The Pythagorean Theorem is arguably the most <i>famous</i> statement in mathematics, and the fourth most <i>beautiful</i> equation.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Journal Physics World (2004), as reported in the New York Times, Ideas and Trends, 24 October 2004, p. 12." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d83977819e279">1</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Maor, E.

However, ironically, not much is really known about him – not even his likeness. What is <i>known</i> about Pythagoras is generally considered more <i>fiction</i> than fact, as historians who lived hundreds of years later provided the <i>facts</i> about his life. There are definite details of Pythagoras’ life from early biographies that use original sources, yet are written by authors who attribute divine powers to him, and present him as a deity figure. Consequently, most historians treat this information as legend. Few historians view the information with any degree of historical importance because it is obtained from rare original sources.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Maor, E.

He is an extremely important figure in the development of mathematics, yet relatively little is known about his mathematical achievements. Unlike many later Greek mathematicians, who wrote a number of books, there are no writings by Pythagoras. However, there is evidence that Pythagoras founded a school (in what is now Crotone, to the east of the heel of southern Italy) named <i>the Semicircle of Pythagoras</i> – half-religious and half-scientific, which followed a code of secrecy. Because secrecy is often controversial, Pythagoras is a mysterious figure. The members of the Semicircle of Pythagoras – the Pythagoreans – were bound by an allegiance that was strictly enforced. However, the Semicircle was more than just a school that studied intellectual disciplines, including in particular philosophy, mathematics and astronomy.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="

The latter is reflected in the Pythagorean motto: <i>Number Rules the Universe</i>.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Maor, E.

Pythagoreans consumed vegetarian dried and condensed food and unleavened bread (as matzos, used by the Biblical Jewish priestly class (the Kohanim), and used today during the Jewish holiday of Passover).<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="

Moreover, out of respect for their leader, many of the discoveries made by the Pythagoreans were attributed to Pythagoras himself; this would account for the term ‘Pythagoras’ Theorem’. Consequently, of Pythagoras’ actual work nothing is known. On the other hand, his school practiced collectivism, making it hard to distinguish between the work of Pythagoras and that of his followers; this would account for the term ‘Pythagorean Theorem’. Therefore, the true discovery of a particular Pythagorean result may never be known. Regardless of the uncertainty of Pythagoras’ actual contributions, however, his school made outstanding contributions to mathematics.</p><p>Is seems that Pythagoras was the first person to define the consonant acoustic relationships between strings of proportional lengths. Specifically, strings of equal tension of proportional lengths create tones of proportional frequencies when plucked. For example, a string that is 2 feet long will vibrate <i>x</i> times per second (that is, hertz, a unit of frequency equal to one cycle per second), while a string that is 1 foot long will vibrate twice as fast: 2<i>x</i>. Furthermore, those two frequencies create a perfect octave.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="

The Pythagoreans were so troubled over the finding of irrational numbers that they swore each other to secrecy about its existence. It is known that one Pythagorean did tell someone outside the school, and he was never to be found thereafter, that is, he was murdered, as Pythagoras himself was murdered by oppressors of the Semicircle of Pythagoras.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="

First, it proves that the Babylonians knew how to compute the square root of a number with remarkable accuracy. The unknown scribe who carved these numbers into a clay tablet nearly 4000 years ago showed a simple method of computing: multiply the side of the square by the square root of 2. But there remains one unanswered question: Why did the scribe choose a side of 30 for his example? Probably, 30 was used for convenience, as it was part of the Babylonian system of sexagesimal, a base-60 numeral system. From this one derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 min in an hour and 360 (60 × 6) degrees in a circle.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="

The manuscript was prepared in 1907 and published in 1927. A revised second edition appeared in 1940, and this was reprinted by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics in 1968 as part of its ‘Classics in Mathematics Education’ series. Loomis received literally hundreds of new proofs from after his book was released up until his death, but he could not keep up with his compendium. As for the exact number of proofs, no one is sure how many there are. Surprisingly, geometricians often find it quite difficult to determine whether certain proofs are in fact distinct proofs. Befitting of someone who collects solutions of the Pythagorean Theorem (I belittle neither the effort nor its value), Loomis, known for living an orderly life, extended his writing to his own obituary in 1934, which he left in a letter headed ‘For the Berea Enterprise immediately following my death’.

Here were assertions, as for example the intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle in one point, which – though by no means evident – could nevertheless be proved with such certainty that any doubt appeared to be out of the question. This lucidity and certainty made an indescribable impression upon me. For example I remember that an uncle told me the Pythagorean Theorem before the holy geometry booklet had come into my hands. After much effort I succeeded in ‘proving’ this theorem on the basis of the similarity of triangles … for anyone who experiences [these feelings] for the first time, it is marvelous enough that man is capable at all to reach such a degree of certainty and purity in pure thinking as the Greeks showed us for the first time to be possible in geometry.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 23" title="Schilpp, P.

Fermat conjectured that there were no non-zero integer solutions for <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> when <i>n</i> was greater than 2. He did not leave a proof, though. Instead, in the <i>margin</i> of a textbook, he wrote that he knew that this relationship was not possible, but he did not have enough room on the page to write it down. His conjecture became known as <i>Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem</i>. This may appear to be a simple problem on the surface, but it was not until 1993 when Andrew Wiles of Princeton University finally proved the 350-year-old marginalized theorem, which appeared on the front page of the <i>New York Times</i>.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 36" title="

It is therefore surprising to find that Fermat was a <i>lawyer</i>, and only an <i>amateur</i> mathematician. Also surprising is the fact that he published only one mathematical paper in his life, and that was an anonymous paper written as an appendix to a colleague&#39;s book.</p><p>Because Fermat refused to publish his work, his friends feared that it would soon be forgotten unless something was done about it. His son Samuel undertook the task of collecting Fermat&#39;s letters and other mathematical papers, comments written in books and so on with the goal of publishing his father&#39;s mathematical ideas. Samuel found the <i>marginal</i> note (<i>the proof</i> could not fit on the page) in his father&#39;s copy of Diophantus&#39;s <i>Arithmetica</i>.

He earned his BA in 1974 after study at Merton College, Oxford, and a PhD in 1980 after research at Clare College, Cambridge. His graduate research was guided by John Coates beginning in the summer of 1975. Together they worked on the arithmetic of elliptic curves with complex multiplication using the methods of Iwasawa theory.</p><p>He further worked with Barry Mazur on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory over <i>Q</i> and soon afterwards generalized this result to totally real fields. Taking approximately 7 years to complete the work, Wiles was the first person to prove Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem, earning him a place in history. Andrew Wiles’ most famous mathematical result is that all rational semi-stable elliptic curves are modular, which, in particular, implies Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem.</p><p>Wiles was introduced to Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem at the age of 10. He tried to prove the theorem using textbook methods and later studied the work of mathematicians who had tried to prove it. When he began his graduate studies, he stopped trying to prove the theorem and began studying elliptic curves under the supervision of John Coates.</p><p>In the 1950s and 1960s, a connection between elliptic curves and modular forms was conjectured by the Japanese mathematician Goro Shimura based on some ideas that Yutaka Taniyama posed. In the West, this conjecture became well known through a paper by André Weil. With Weil giving conceptual evidence for it, it is sometimes called the Shimura–Taniyama–Weil conjecture. It states that every rational elliptic curve is modular. The full conjecture was proven by Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond and Richard Taylor in 1998 using many of the methods that Andrew Wiles used in his 1995 published papers.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 38" title="

                      <p>There is concrete (not Portland cement, but a clay tablet) evidence that indisputably indicates that the Pythagorean Theorem was discovered and proven by Babylonian mathematicians 1000 years before Pythagoras was born.</p>

                      <p>So many people, young and old, famous and not famous, <i>have touched</i> the Pythagorean Theorem. The eccentric mathematics teacher Elisha Scott Loomis spent a lifetime collecting all known proofs and writing them up in <i>The Pythagorean Proposition,</i> a compendium of 371 proofs. The manuscript was published in 1927, and a revised, second edition appeared in 1940. As for the exact number of proofs, no one is sure how many there are. Surprisingly, geometricians often find it quite difficult to determine whether some proofs are in fact distinct proofs. Moreover, the theorem seemingly has no ending, as every year students, academicians and problem solvers with a mathematical bent tackle the theorem in an attempt to add new and innovative proofs.</p>

                      <p>In addition, many people&#39;s lives <i>have been touched</i> by the Pythagorean Theorem. A 12-year-old Albert Einstein was touched by the earthbound spirit of the Pythagorean Theorem. The wunderkind provided a proof that was notable for its elegance and simplicity. However, the spirit of the Pythagoras’ Theorem was not finished with young Einstein: two decades later he used the Pythagorean Theorem in the Special Theory of Relativity (in a four-dimensional form), and in a vastly expanded form in the General Theory of Relativity. That Einstein used Pythagorean Theorem for his Relativity would be enough to show Pythagorean Theorem&#39;s value, or importance to the world. But, people continued to find value in the Pythagorean Theorem, namely, Wiles.</p>

                      <p>The theorem&#39;s spirit also visited another youngster, a 10-year-old British Andrew Wiles, and returned two decades later to an unknown Professor Wiles. Young Wiles tried to prove the theorem using textbook methods, and later studied the work of mathematicians who had tried to prove it. When he began his graduate studies, he stopped trying to prove the theorem and began studying elliptic curves, which provided the path for proving Fermat&#39;s Theorem, the news of which made to the front page of the <i>New York Times</i> in 1993. Sir Andrew Wiles will forever be famous for his generalized version of the Pythagoras Theorem.</p>
