    <h1>Is TfL losing the battle against heat on the Victoria line?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                
<p><strong>The Victoria Line stubbornly remains the hottest underground line, <strong>according to new TfL data, </strong> resisting the numerous cooling efforts enacted by TfL and presenting little potential for change.</strong></p>



<p>Dubbed after Queen Victoria, the Underground line recorded an average temperature of 28 degrees Celsius in 2024, the same average as 2023, closely followed by the Central Line with 26.8.</p>



<p>Temperatures hiked as high as 31.1 degrees in August 2024 – the hottest month of the year – superseding August in 2023, and within the last two years, temperatures never dropped below 25 degrees Celsius – even within the winter months. </p>



<p>Underground commuters have had to bear temperatures beyond the legally-advised temperature to transport cattle, which stands at 30 degrees, as outlined by UK government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/keeping-farm-animals-and-horses-in-extreme-weather">guidelines</a>. </p>



<p>Millions are being invested into cooling technologies to make the Underground more bearable for commuters by TfL: at present, 40% of the Underground network is equipped with air-conditioning, and tunnel ventilation systems have been installed for both the Victoria and Jubilee lines.   </p>




<p>TfL’s Director of Customer Operations Nick Dent said that the organisation is working diligently to strengthen its transport services in light of increasingly extreme and frequent hot weather. </p>



<p>He added: “We’re constantly looking at how these innovative solutions could be rolled more widely on the transport network to ensure more passengers experience cool and comfortable journeys in the summer.”</p>



<p>However, while climate change insists on being a general concern for most underground train lines, the Victoria and Central lines pose a more unique challenge to TfL engineers. </p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>Since 2013, the Victoria line temperatures have steadily increased at a faster pace than any other line, finally surpassing the Central line in 2019, and the Bakerloo line in 2021.</p>



<p>The average temperatures on the Victoria line have risen by almost seven degrees since 2013 – nearly a 30% increase.</p>



<p>Conversely, the increase in the average annual temperatures across all Underground lines from 2013 to 2024 was merely seven percent, placing Victoria’s temperature rise vastly above that.</p>




<p>The Victoria line has remained predominantly unaffected by TfL’s engineering efforts to cool down the temperatures – including tunnel ventilation installations, chiller systems pumping chilled air into mid-tunnel shafts and regenerative braking to reduce heat generated by trains breaking. </p>



<p>TfL Senior Press Officer Chris Clements acknowledged the distinctive challenge that the Victoria and Central line tunnels present.</p>



<p>He said: “With the Victoria and Central lines, they are some of the deepest Tube lines on the network, going through thick London clay. </p>



<p>“This clay acts as a heat insulator, meaning these lines get hotter than other tube lines. </p>



<p>“The depth of these lines also makes the ventilation of heat – usually through vents at surface level – more challenging.”</p>



<p>Historically, the Underground infrastructure offered a respite from warm weather, indicated in Austin Cooper’s <a href="https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/collections/collections-online/posters/item/1983-4-2030">‘It is cooler below’</a> poster, issued in 1924 by the Underground group to promote a more comfortable experience of travel during warm weather.</p>



<p>At present, the Victoria line is one of two train lines running entirely underground, and with vast temperature differences to the past – including sweltering heat waves – this quality is more likely to be considered as a liability than a convenience. </p>



<p>As a result of the line being completely submerged underground, Clements said the effect of cooler air cannot be drawn into the tunnels from the surface.</p>



<p>The Senior Press Officer added that with many stations in close succession, the Victoria and Central lines experience frequent acceleration and braking, contributing to heat buildup within the tunnels. </p>



<p>However, unlike the Victoria line trains, the Central Line Improvement Programme (CLIP) offers a future of completely refurbished trains to be completed by 2029 – backed by a £500 million investment. </p>



<p>With summer approaching and London already experiencing a May heatwave, the new data suggests that high temperatures may once again be the norm on the Underground this year.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Victoria Line average temperature in August last year was 60% higher in temperature than the average external temperature that month, measured at 19.5 degrees.  </p>



<p>The average temperature of all underground lines that month was around 27 degrees, almost 44% more than the average external temperature. </p>



<p>However, the summer seasons are not the only months affected by hot temperatures. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The data shows that the average temperatures of the Victoria line in the first quarter of 2024 – January, February and March – are the highest they’ve ever been since 2013, reaching a disproportionate average temperature of 26 degrees. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The same applies for the average temperatures in the second quarter of 2024 – April, May and June – hiking to around 28 degrees. </p>



<p>Evidently, the Victoria line is not the only line to be affected by steep temperatures in typically cooler months. </p>



<p>Annie Mcclure from North London fainted from heat exhaustion as a result of high temperatures in a densely packed Northern line in February 2024.</p>



<p>The 31-year-old said: “I got on at Tottenham Court Road, and the train was packed. </p>



<p>“Luckily I had a seat, but I could feel myself overheating so I took my coat off two stops before I was getting off.</p>



<p>“As I got up for my stop, I could feel myself going, and I just fainted.”</p>



<p>Mcclure said she had no underlying health issues, and that her fainting was purely a result from the heat on the tube. </p>



<p>She added: “It was crazy because before I got onto the train, I went for lunch and I was hydrated.”</p>



<p>The average temperature for February of that year was nine degrees, while the Northern line average for that same month was 23.</p>



<p>As TfL’s engineering interventions have shown limited success, passengers susceptible to high temperatures might be better served by opting for cooler Underground routes this summer. </p>



<p>The air-conditioned sub-surface lines* collectively held the lowest average temperature of 2024, at 19 degrees, followed by the Waterloo and City line at 20 and finally the Jubilee at 22. </p>



<p>In August, the hottest month of that year, the sub-surface lines reached their highest temperature of 25.7 degrees celsius, which conversely, was the lowest temperature the Victoria line stooped down to in the cooler month of January. </p>



<p>*Sub-surface lines are the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City, District and Metropolitan lines.</p>
