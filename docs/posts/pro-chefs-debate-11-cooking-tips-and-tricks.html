    <h1>Pro Chefs Debate 11 Cooking Tips and Tricks</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Agree or disagree?</p><p>If you throw your pasta at the wall</p><p>and it sticks, it&#39;s done.</p><p>Does it ever stick?</p><p>[whip sound]</p><p>Ahh.</p><p>It also wasn&#39;t hot.</p><p>Today we&#39;re in the test kitchen</p><p>and were gonna be talking about common cooking tips.</p><p>There are mandatory cooking tips</p><p>that you should definitely follow.</p><p>Other cooking tips, probably safe to say you can ignore.</p><p>[laughing]</p><p>Hundred percent disagree.</p><p>Disagree.</p><p>And we&#39;re gonna put a few to the test.</p><p>That&#39;s like your pro move.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>But like, is it everybody&#39;s pro move?</p><p>Maybe not.</p><p>I mean, cooking tips are like advice.</p><p>I mean, it&#39;s not always good.</p><p>[laughing]</p><p>Word.</p><p>I think whatever works for you, you should go with that.</p><p>Oh and Devon disagree.</p><p>[laughing]</p><p>Agree or disagree?</p><p>Fruits ripen faster if placed in a paper bag</p><p>with apples or bananas</p><p>I&#39;ve done it a lot of times.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Yeah. That&#39;s just true.</p><p>The fruit ripening faster is real.</p><p>The saying of like you are who you hang around hey.</p><p>[laughing]</p><p>Like if something&#39;s like</p><p>if one thing is ripe already and then the other one&#39;s not.</p><p>Fruits, like they actually like release like ethylene gas.</p><p>Oh wow.</p><p>Which like speeds up the ripening process</p><p>And it helps change the atmosphere</p><p>and allow the fruit that you have in there.</p><p>That&#39;s under ripe</p><p>to think that it&#39;s in an atmosphere perfect for ripening.</p><p>You might wanna fact check all that, but it sounded good.</p><p>Agree.</p><p>Totally agree.</p><p>Yes. Disagree.</p><p>Agree. Agree? Agree.</p><p>I agree with that.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>Put it in the paper bag.</p><p>Agree or disagree?</p><p>Marinating for 30 minutes achieves the same goal</p><p>as marinating for 24 hours.</p><p>Ooh.</p><p>Come on.</p><p>What are we talking about?</p><p>Who put this in there?</p><p>What&#39;s the marinade?</p><p>Like give a case study.</p><p>Situation marination. It&#39;s definitely.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>And I think it depends on the on the piece of meat</p><p>and what the marinade is.</p><p>Right?</p><p>True.</p><p>Especially if it&#39;s a high salt content.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Right.</p><p>You don&#39;t wanna marinate for 24 hours, you know?</p><p>Some time is better than no time</p><p>You know, pineapple juice or vinegar</p><p>in a little bitty thing</p><p>like a quick kind of thing like that.</p><p>You leave that in there for 24 hours</p><p>things start to get a little weird.</p><p>The way ceviche gets, you know</p><p>fish gets cooked by lemon juice.</p><p>It starts to kind of</p><p>Turn a little</p><p>Yeah things start to happen.</p><p>So it really depends on the marinade.</p><p>So now it looks like we got two types of</p><p>we got two pork tender loins.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>One&#39;s marinated for half an hour</p><p>and one&#39;s marinated for 24 hours.</p><p>Nice.</p><p>Let&#39;s see if we can tell the</p><p>The difference.</p><p>Yeah. A little difference.</p><p>And we can go ahead and call it a blind tasting.</p><p>You know pork Tenderloin in general, underrated.</p><p>I like the color meat.</p><p>Getting a little [inaudible]</p><p>I&#39;m gonna guess the second one is the shorter marinade</p><p>and the other one was the longer.</p><p>The outside texture.</p><p>Yep.</p><p>This one&#39;s a little tighter.</p><p>That&#39;s correct.</p><p>Oh, hands down.</p><p>I don&#39;t even get the vinegar.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Way less flavor.</p><p>Uh huh. I think this one also</p><p>the bite is nicer too.</p><p>Like it melts almost in your mouth, right?</p><p>Like you said earlier it&#39;s about leaner cuts of meat.</p><p>Right.</p><p>You need to really marinate a pork tenderloin.</p><p>Let it permeate inside the piece of meat.</p><p>I think that&#39;s great.</p><p>I would say that&#39;s the one.</p><p>Certainly. Yep that&#39;s the one. Yep.</p><p>The time matters.</p><p>And if you&#39;re using aromatics</p><p>and ingredients that are like fully broken down,</p><p>massively flavorful, like yeah.</p><p>If you&#39;re doing like, you know, fully grated</p><p>like lemon grass, ginger, garlic</p><p>with like some fish sauce and some soy sauce, like okay.</p><p>30 minutes is gonna be</p><p>you&#39;re going notice a difference.</p><p>[Inaudible crosstalk]</p><p>It&#39;s gonna, something&#39;s gonna happen.</p><p>But like you can&#39;t say it&#39;s the same as 24 hours.</p><p>No way.</p><p>That&#39;s out.</p><p>Not on our watch.</p><p>So I think that the question is flawed</p><p>and I disagree.</p><p>Agree or disagree?</p><p>Adding oil to pasta water prevents pasta from sticking.</p><p>Crush em&#39; more?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>I have no idea.</p><p>I don&#39;t be cooking pasta like that to be honest.</p><p>I&#39;ve never done it.</p><p>But not in the pasta water.</p><p>I stopped doing that like six years ago</p><p>Pasta tends to stick when you take it</p><p>out of the water after it&#39;s cooked.</p><p>Right.</p><p>If it&#39;s like sitting outside of the water</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>For like more than a couple minutes,</p><p>Than it&#39;ll stick.</p><p>Then it&#39;s gonna start to stick.</p><p>And at that point you could put a little bit of oil on it.</p><p>Like if you&#39;re making a pasta salad,</p><p>definitely oil.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>That&#39;s false.</p><p>I think there&#39;s been a bunch</p><p>of studies that says you don&#39;t have to do that.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>What I was told that has to do with it</p><p>is keeping the water from foaming over.</p><p>It creates a skim on top.</p><p>[laughing]</p><p>Disagree.</p><p>You don&#39;t need to do all that.</p><p>Don&#39;t waste your oil that way.</p><p>Save your oil for another day.</p><p>I think disagree.</p><p>It&#39;s giving disagree.</p><p>Adding citrus to guacamole will stop it</p><p>from oxidizing, agree or disagree?</p><p>I mean, agree.</p><p>But what kind of citrus are we talking about?</p><p>I always add citrus to guacamole.</p><p>I think it helps, yeah.</p><p>It&#39;s gotta.</p><p>I mean it certainly does.</p><p>The same way you know, when you put it on an apple slice</p><p>it prevents it from browning, right?</p><p>I&#39;ve seen like people do like vitamin C</p><p>because it&#39;s like very powerful</p><p>but you&#39;re not gonna like taste it the same way.</p><p>Citrus lime definitely helps from oxidizing.</p><p>The lime is there for flavor though too.</p><p>The question, is how quickly should you eat guacamole?</p><p>And then I think the answer is very fast.</p><p>Almost as fast as you can.</p><p>[laughing]</p><p>As fast as you can.</p><p>It also gives a nice flavor too &#39;cause it&#39;s super fatty.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna go ahead and say agree.</p><p>Agree.</p><p>Agree</p><p>Agree.</p><p>Agree.</p><p>Agree or disagree?</p><p>You should wash your mushrooms before cooking.</p><p>Overall I don&#39;t wash my mushrooms.</p><p>I brush &#39;em off.</p><p>It&#39;s usually not dirt.</p><p>It&#39;s usually forest duff.</p><p>Mushrooms are sponges.</p><p>Water. Doesn&#39;t actually clean them.</p><p>That&#39;s the thing about it too.</p><p>It&#39;s just like,</p><p>it&#39;s not like running berries under the faucet.</p><p>If you wash your mushrooms</p><p>that even furthers you down the path of like</p><p>waterlogged, steaming, gooby mushroom in the pan.</p><p>Rather than that like</p><p>delightful, meaty, crispy, savory</p><p>thing you&#39;re aiming for.</p><p>I mean, it&#39;s like an oyster, you know,</p><p>it&#39;s a product of its environment</p><p>and you know, really, if you&#39;re going</p><p>and picking, &#39;em out of a pile of [beep] maybe,</p><p>[laughing]</p><p>Ah [beep].</p><p>But like, you know if it&#39;s just like</p><p>a really nice forest, you know</p><p>you give &#39;em a little brush brush.</p><p>If you like soggy mushrooms</p><p>You love soggy soggy mushrooms.</p><p>Soak your mushrooms.</p><p>For sure.</p><p>Just like bathe them.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Big disagree.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Two thumbs down.</p><p>Don&#39;t wash your mushrooms.</p><p>Disagree.</p><p>Boo.</p><p>Agree or disagree?</p><p>Silpat baking mats are better for even baking</p><p>versus parchment versus foil.</p><p>Like I don&#39;t really necessarily have like a</p><p>hard and fast answer on this.</p><p>I think Silpats,</p><p>That is like a professional, like silicone baking mat,</p><p>Like most home cooks, like frankly don&#39;t have them.</p><p>Sometimes I feel like Silpats might inhibit</p><p>a touch of browning.</p><p>And like [beep] with your spreading,</p><p>like on cookies a little bit maybe.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>I have a Silpat they get so greasy</p><p>and you can&#39;t wash them.</p><p>Like you wash them and it just doesn&#39;t clean them</p><p>the way that you wanna clean them.</p><p>Evenness.</p><p>Is that what we&#39;re talking about?</p><p>For even baking.</p><p>Probably.</p><p>I mean it&#39;s more expensive with Silpat though,</p><p>cause those are expensive.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I don&#39;t wanna bake on foil.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>The reason you do parchment or a Silpat</p><p>is because it&#39;s non-stick.</p><p>That&#39;s the whole point of either of those surfaces.</p><p>You have parchment.</p><p>No parchment.</p><p>No foil.</p><p>No Silpat.</p><p>Silpat.</p><p>Foil.</p><p>I feel like Silpats like contribute even heat.</p><p>Really interesting.</p><p>I&#39;m an advocate for them.</p><p>I&#39;ve had them for years.</p><p>They last for a really long time.</p><p>This is maybe turning me into a convert.</p><p>The thing that like existed in my mind</p><p>but possibly not in reality</p><p>is just because this surface is relatively smooth</p><p>Ya know?</p><p>That like you might get a little bit more spreading with it.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Relative to like others.</p><p>But what&#39;s weird is like the foil spread most of all.</p><p>Oh you know what?</p><p>I hope the foil doesn&#39;t stick to this.</p><p>Oh. But look it, the Silpat, it&#39;s wrinkly.</p><p>It&#39;s gooey in the middle.</p><p>It&#39;s even all the way through on the bottom.</p><p>I just love like, I love that structure.</p><p>I love how kind of crisp along the bottom.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>But it&#39;s a little bit, you know,</p><p>kind of gooey on the top.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I&#39;m wildly impressed by the Silpat.</p><p>I also think taking the time to do this kind</p><p>of exercise always teaches you something</p><p>Like not agree or disagree.</p><p>Just sideways.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna say agree.</p><p>Agree also.</p><p>Agree or disagree?</p><p>Beans need to be soaked overnight before cooking.</p><p>If you&#39;re in a pinch yeah.</p><p>If you want to be super traditional, soak it overnight.</p><p>But you know, I don&#39;t think you need to.</p><p>People say they&#39;re like more tender</p><p>if you soak them first.</p><p>But I find that that&#39;s not true and it&#39;s always fine.</p><p>I</p><p>Oh, Devon disagrees.</p><p>[laughing]</p><p>So I&#39;m like, that&#39;s funny</p><p>but I&#39;ve got bean feelings.</p><p>Soaking is a good practice.</p><p>And trying to do some prep the day before is nice.</p><p>I don&#39;t think you don&#39;t need so, man,</p><p>if you have a nice, it&#39;s the pot, you gonna cook the beans</p><p>for an hour and a half and it&#39;ll be good.</p><p>And it really comes down to like not all beans are equal.</p><p>If you got some beans that&#39;s been sitting</p><p>on a shelf for 35 years.</p><p>I think it might not ever really get tender.</p><p>If you wanna soak your beans, soak those beans.</p><p>But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like mandatory.</p><p>So I&#39;m gonna have to disagree.</p><p>Yeah. Disagree.</p><p>Agree or disagree?</p><p>The best way to get crispy bacon</p><p>is to start with a cold pan.</p><p>I do not cook bacon in a pan.</p><p>Same.</p><p>I cook bacon on a wire rack in the oven.</p><p>Yes. Thank you exactly.</p><p>Because of like circulation and letting the fat drip.</p><p>If you want like the ultimate in like crispiness</p><p>like you&#39;re better off baking it on a rack.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>So essentially you&#39;re starting out with the cold pan.</p><p>Which like, is that a cold pan?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>Or are we cheating?</p><p>You know, you bake the bacon.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>It&#39;s even. It&#39;s crispy.</p><p>It&#39;s the best.</p><p>I&#39;m just so curious about the cold pan now.</p><p>Does that prevent it from quick shrinkage?</p><p>It does get small if it&#39;s a hot pan, right?</p><p>You ready to test this?</p><p>Let&#39;s try it.</p><p>I want to be disproved.</p><p>Let&#39;s do some science.</p><p>This is our cold pan.</p><p>This is our hot pan</p><p>Bacon.</p><p>Do we try it out?</p><p>See what happens?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Put a few strips in.</p><p>You can see it happening in the pan.</p><p>You know that it&#39;s hot.</p><p>It&#39;s nice actually, to be able to see the color change.</p><p>Now I&#39;m gonna put the bacon in the cold pan.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Turning that on.</p><p>Okay. We&#39;ll see.</p><p>Our pan is going.</p><p>Starting.</p><p>It feels like it&#39;s in a sauna.</p><p>It&#39;s like, Ooh.</p><p>So you can see it bubbling out.</p><p>But even in this amount of time</p><p>it&#39;s like a fraction of the amount</p><p>of rendered out fat has happened in our hot pan.</p><p>Wait for this to crisp up, fully cook</p><p>and then we&#39;ll try them.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Wow. That is</p><p>Some difference.</p><p>It&#39;s been through some things.</p><p>I think the hot pan is crispier,</p><p>but to it&#39;s detriment.</p><p>But that just might also be</p><p>because we let it go for a long time.</p><p>I think it, yeah.</p><p>I feel sad.</p><p>Hot pan.</p><p>It happens really quickly.</p><p>So if you&#39;re not paying attention, your bacon will go</p><p>from perfect to charred in like the blink of an eye.</p><p>The cold pan, they stay flatter,</p><p>but they&#39;re not as crisp.</p><p>This is a good piece of bacon</p><p>but it&#39;s not crispier than that.</p><p>Don&#39;t waste your time in a cold pan.</p><p>If you want crispiness fast.</p><p>I think hot pan.</p><p>For my mental health, I&#39;m gonna pick the hot pan.</p><p>The goal is eat bacon sooner.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>So the hot pan is the move.</p><p>Yeah. I don&#39;t put bacon on like a hot skillet.</p><p>Agree</p><p>With some caveats.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if this is factual, but I&#39;m gonna say agree.</p><p>[beep] do it [beep]</p><p>[laughing]</p><p>Agree or disagree?</p><p>The reverse-sear method is the best way</p><p>to cook a perfect medium rare steak.</p><p>There&#39;s like the flipping every 10 seconds technique.</p><p>There&#39;s cooking on one side for this amount of minutes</p><p>then flipping it over and then resting it.</p><p>I think reverse searing it kind of just</p><p>I don&#39;t wanna say it complicates things</p><p>but it takes extra steps.</p><p>The fact that it&#39;s like for a steak</p><p>that&#39;s kind of tripping me up</p><p>For like a larger roast.</p><p>I&#39;ve done that sometimes.</p><p>Ooh. I wanna go ahead and say complicated question.</p><p>I don&#39;t think that it needs to be reverse cooked</p><p>to make it perfect.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>You know I&#39;m really classic, you know,</p><p>straight up, over the flame, pan.</p><p>Get it going.</p><p>Get it on fire.</p><p>T bones and all I wouldn&#39;t do a reverse-sear.</p><p>I would just go straight up with that.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Like flank steak, nah.</p><p>You know, but like big bigger massed item</p><p>or something super lean like a wild game.</p><p>You kind of can&#39;t go wrong.</p><p>Disagree on the superlative best.</p><p>&#39;Cause I think that there&#39;s many ways to skin a cat.</p><p>So disagree.</p><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the best way.</p><p>I think it&#39;s a way.</p><p>[laughing]</p><p>Agree or disagree?</p><p>You should rinse your meat before cooking.</p><p>A hundred percent disagree.</p><p>Especially if it comes from a reputable place.</p><p>I mean, you got those nice enzymes</p><p>in there that they, you know</p><p>they already work so hard to like care for this animal.</p><p>Like do all these things.</p><p>It actually starts</p><p>with knowing how to source your meat properly.</p><p>If you&#39;re able to source something</p><p>and buy it at the peak of its quality</p><p>and like you know that you&#39;re butcher or fish monger,</p><p>you know has your back</p><p>and is not trying to give you something that&#39;s like rancid</p><p>or like going off.</p><p>Like you should definitely trust</p><p>that it&#39;s been cleaned and processed the way that it is.</p><p>Some companies, chicken be yellow as [beep].</p><p>You know what I&#39;m saying?</p><p>I worked in some places where</p><p>I&#39;m not sure a little rinse</p><p>in some fresh water&#39;s gonna help that.</p><p>No it goes with lemon a lil&#39; big</p><p>I&#39;m just kidding.</p><p>[laughing]</p><p>He knows all the tricks.</p><p>No. If there&#39;s something wrong with the meat</p><p>that&#39;s gonna be like inherent to the meat</p><p>and like a rinse, a shower is not gonna fix that.</p><p>No it&#39;s not gonna do it.</p><p>Like if it&#39;s like coming out of a package from the grocery</p><p>It has like this slimy like layer and</p><p>I don&#39;t really wanna eat that.</p><p>So I rinse it off, dry it as much as possible.</p><p>But if I&#39;m going to like a local butcher,</p><p>it&#39;s coming in like butcher paper,</p><p>I know that it hasn&#39;t been sitting inside something plastic</p><p>or weird for a long time, then I won&#39;t rinse it.</p><p>Yeah. I generally speaking</p><p>I can&#39;t really be bothered to like</p><p>even the grocery store stuff, like rinse it</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>But I mean, but I&#39;m not like, opposed to that.</p><p>You need to know where your food comes from.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>That is key.</p><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary.</p><p>So I&#39;m gonna say disagree</p><p>A hundred percent disagree.</p><p>Hard boiled eggs should be started in cold water.</p><p>I disagree with should.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Hard boiled eggs can be started in cold water.</p><p>It just takes longer.</p><p>We&#39;re all trying to get to the same place.</p><p>It&#39;s just whatever method you&#39;re more comfortable with.</p><p>I love a six to eight minute egg.</p><p>And I feel like if I boiled it first</p><p>it&#39;s not gonna be the same amount of time</p><p>and I&#39;m gonna have to take it out, check it.</p><p>And it&#39;s like, what if it&#39;s not right.</p><p>Cold in a lot of ways is better</p><p>but I think it&#39;s harder to time.</p><p>But if you are starting in cold water</p><p>when does it come to a boil?</p><p>It&#39;s nebulus time.</p><p>When do you start your count?</p><p>At what point is a boil a boil?</p><p>I start with boiling water</p><p>and then I add the egg only because it&#39;s faster.</p><p>You know, for me, I boil it first.</p><p>and then I</p><p>Hot water right in.</p><p>Yeah. Right in.</p><p>So I would say I disagree.</p><p>I agree because I feel like it helps me gauge the minutes.</p><p>Either way. You&#39;re gonna break some eggs.</p><p>I&#39;m here for starting out with cold water</p><p>Take your cooking tips with a grain of salt.</p><p>Even two people who like, you know</p><p>arguably know how to cook, can like disagree.</p><p>Absolutely</p><p>About like the best way to do something.</p><p>But like, that&#39;s just part of the rich tapestry of life.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Be cognizant of where cooking tips are coming from</p><p>because potentially it could be a bad source.</p><p>They&#39;re like opinions, you know,</p><p>everyone&#39;s got &#39;em they&#39;re not all good.</p><p>You know?</p><p>[beep] that&#39;s really good man.</p><p>You know, you kind just take the ones at work,</p><p>you apply &#39;em and then if they&#39;re true</p><p>and they work then you tell your buddies,</p><p>and then you start the trend of your own tips.</p><p>Brush your shoulder off, you know what I&#39;m saying?</p><p>[laughing]</p><p>Brush your shoulder off, they&#39;re learning.</p><p>Cooking tips with Brad and Harold, we agree.</p><p>I also think we should specify that Devon is literally</p><p>kneeling and like the same height as me</p><p>kneeling on the ground.</p><p>[laughing]</p><p>I was like, wait</p><p>why is it so easy to look into your eyeball</p><p>Like almost.</p><p>I&#39;m quite low.</p><p>Quite down there.</p><p>[laughing]</p></div></div>
