    <h1>The Grammar According to West</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
I have been accumulating observations about writing mathematics for many years.
These conclusions arose both from writing textbooks and from noting writing
errors commonly made by my thesis students and in papers submitted to journals.

</p><p>
My first objective was to train my students, thereby reducing the time needed
to edit their theses.  As the document grew, I made it publicly available in
the hope that others may find it useful.  I have received a broad range of
responses, mostly positive.  If you don&#39;t find it useful (or if you object to
it on principle), then please ignore it.  I hope to make some writers of
mathematics (especially students and non-native speakers of English) aware of
issues they may not have considered; small changes can produce mathematical
writing that is easier to read by wider audiences.

</p><p>
I note that a number of other articles and even books have been published on
writing mathematics; see some of these <a href="#references">here</a>.
I list these just to make alternative viewpoints available, without judgment
pro or con.  One contrast to note is that my list below focuses on relatively
specific items.  I have not yet included much discussion of the general
structure of an article; some of these references discuss that.

</p><p>
Live mathematical conversations use many shortcuts that are inappropriate in
precise mathematical writing.  The context is known by all participants, and
shortcuts evolve to save time.  Furthermore, the speaker can immediately
clarify ambiguity.  Without immediate access to the author, written mathematics
must use language more carefully.  Also, mathematical concepts are abstract,
without context from everyday experience, so the writing must be more
consistent to make the meaning clear.  Outside mathematics, imprecise writing
can still be understood because the objects and concepts discussed are familiar.

</p><p>
Some mathematicians object to some of my recommendations.  Many time-honored
practices in the writing of mathematics are grammatically incorrect.  These
mistakes in writing cause no difficulty for readers with sufficient
mathematical sophistication or familiarity with the subject, but it is
unnecessary to restrict the audience to such readers.  A bit of care leads to
clearer writing that makes mathematics more easily accessible and readable to a
wider and less specialized audience.

</p><p>
Some languages have conventions of usage or grammar that lead to typical errors
in English mathematical writing by their native speakers.  I discuss some
such items in a separate section at the end.  I use some terminology for
English parts of speech and punctuation in the explanations.  I hope that
readers who are unfamiliar with these terms will still benefit from seeing 
the recommendations.

</p><p>
I apologize in advance for my own grammatical errors.  Habits die hard, and it
is easy to err in applying principles of writing.  In particular, there are
inconsistencies between what I propose here and what I wrote in my earlier
books.  Those books were written in the previous millennium, and I have learned
many things about writing since then.  Also, I am a speaker of American
English, and some points are consistently different in British English (such as
the treatment of &#34;which&#34; vs. &#34;that&#34; and the aversion to serial commas).

</p><p>
Some of my conclusions conflict with manuals of English style.  My conclusions
are intended to produce clear mathematical writing that is more logically
consistent than publishers&#39; conventions.  This applies especially to
punctuation and to words that serve as logical connectives.

</p><p>
I welcome corrections, suggestions/inquiries, and &#34;pet peeves&#34; that may lead to
further items in later versions of this guide.

<h2><a name="mathusage">Mathematical style</a></h2>

<li>
<a name="conclusion">
<i>Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion.</i>
We begin with the overall structure of a research article in mathematics.
The abstract states the results as fully as possible in a brief presentation.
Crucial specialized terms the reader needs to know to understand the statements
should be defined.  The abstract stands on its own, especially in the age of
electronic communication where it may be separate from the rest of the paper,
and hence it contains no numbered reference to the bibliography.

<p>
The first section of the paper is an &#34;Introduction&#34; that should motivate the
problem, discuss related results, state the results more completely, and
perhaps summarize the techniques or the structure of the paper or crucial
definitions.

</p><p> The introduction should also contain any <i>concluding remarks</i> or key
conjectures.  There is generally little or no value in a separate section of
concluding remarks.  Such remarks either are redundant or contain information
that readers usually seek in the introduction.  Readers who study the full
details of the proofs have no need of a summary in a concluding section.
Readers who do not read the full details have no desire to go on to a
concluding section.  A mathematical research article is not read like a
novel or even like an essay that seeks to &#34;persuade&#34; the reader; it does not
need an epilogue.

</p></a></li><li><a name="conclusion">
</a><a name="definitions"><i>Definitions.</i></a>
Words being defined should be distinguished by italics (or perhaps boldface in
a textbook context).  When italics are used to indicate a word being defined,
it is unnecessary to use &#34;called&#34; or &#34;said to be&#34;; the use of italics
announces that this is the term being defined and replaces these words.

<p>
Many definitions are phrased as &#34;An object has property <i>italicized term</i>
<b>if</b> <i>condition</i> holds.&#34;  Here we use the word &#34;if&#34; even though
subsequently it is understood that an object satisfies the property being
defined <i>if and only if</i> the given condition holds.  The italicization
alerts the reader to this situation.  The convention can be justified by saying
that the property or object does not actually exist until the definition is
complete, so one does not yet in the definition formally say that the named
property is equivalent to the condition.

</p><p>
Definitions written by non-native speakers sometimes contain extra commas.
In each sentence below, the comma should be deleted.
</p><p>
Note the difference in italicization above.  When written as an adjective-noun
combination, the term being defined is the name for structures that have the
property; hence the full term <i>bipartite graph</i> is italicized.  When the
property alone is being defined and is positioned as a predicate adjective,
only the adjective is italicized.

</p></li><li>
<a name="where">
<i>&#34;Where&#34;.</i>
A formula may contain notation that has not yet been defined, if the definition
of that notation follows immediately in the same sentence.  The formula is then
followed by a comma and the word &#34;where&#34; to introduce the definition.  For
example, &#34;If <i>G</i> is a bipartite graph, then <i>χ&#39;(G)≤Δ(G)</i>,
where <i>χ&#39;(G)</i> is the edge-chromatic number and <i>Δ(G)</i> is the
maximum degree of <i>G</i>.&#34;  (Technically, the second comma is needed because
the subsequent definition is an </a><a href="#appositive">appositive</a>).

<p>
Note the difference between &#34;where&#34; and &#34;such that&#34;.
&#34;Where&#34; is used when the preceding notation is being defined; &#34;such that&#34;
is used when it is already defined and its value is being restricted.

</p></li><li>
<a name="dblduty"><i>Double-Duty Definitions.</i></a>
One cannot make a statement about an object before the object has been defined.
Similarly, one cannot use notation as part of a formula making a statement
about the denoted object unless the notation has previously been defined.  In
particular, these tasks cannot correctly be accomplished at the same time with
one instance of the notation.
For example, &#34;The <i>neighborhood</i> of a vertex <i>v</i> is
<i>N(v)={u: uv∈ E(G)}</i>&#34;
is incorrect.  With a subject and a verb before the equation, the equation
is a single unit (see <a href="#expressions">expressions as units</a>).
This sentence defines the neighborhood of <i>v</i> to be a particular
equation, and it does not define the notation <i>N(v)</i>.

<p>
Of course, readers sufficiently familiar with the context have no trouble
understanding what is meant, but why disenfranchise other readers?  One can
just as easily write &#34;The <i>neighborhood</i> of a vertex <i>v</i>, denoted
<i>N(v)</i>, is <i>{u: uv∈ E(G)}</i>&#34;.  Alternatively, one can introduce
the notation as an <a href="#appositive">appositive</a> in a conventional
position immediate after the term defined: &#34;The <i>neighborhood</i> <i>N(v)</i>
of a vertex <i>v</i> is <i>{u: uv∈ E(G)}</i>&#34;.  

</p><p>
<a name="G=V,E">
A common Double-Duty definition is &#34;Let <i>G=(V,E)</i> be a graph&#34;.  The
sentence defines the equation <i>G=(V,E)</i> to be a graph.  Of course, the
writer intends simultaneously to introduce notation for a particular graph and
its vertex set and edge set, but that is not what the sentence says.  It is
better to write &#34;Let <i>G</i> be a graph&#34; and use operators <i>V</i> and
<i>E</i> to refer to the vertex and edge sets of <i>G</i> as <i>V(G)</i> and
<i>E(G)</i> (see also </a><a href="#operators">Operators vs. constants</a>.)
 
</p><p>
A more subtle example is &#34;For each <i>1≤ i≤ n</i>,&#34;.  The introduction of
the notation <i>i</i> has been lost because the inequalities impose conditions
on it before it is defined.  Since the expression is a unit, grammatically the
phrase is referring to each inequality written in this way.  Correct
alternatives that express the intended meaning include &#34;For all <i>i</i> such
that <i>1≤i≤n</i>&#34;, &#34;For <i>i∈[n]</i>&#34;, and &#34;For
<i>1≤i≤n</i>&#34;.  The third option is slightly different from the others;
it means &#34;whenever <i>i</i> is such that the conditions hold&#34;, implicitly
introducing <i>i</i> in a specified range but avoiding the grammatical problem.

</p></li><li>
<a name="expressions"><i>Expressions as units.</i></a>
Is an equation or inequality a noun unit, or is it read with the relational
symbol as a verb?  Treating the symbol as a verb often forces rereading to
clarify the meaning, and one often wants to have another verb in the sentence.
For these reasons, it is best to treat notational expressions as single objects
(that is, nouns), with some exceptions.

<p>
For example, &#34;there exists <i>i&lt;j</i> with
<i>x<sub>i</sub>=x<sub>j</sub></i>&#34; ascribes a property to the inequality
<i>i&lt;j</i> (and is a Double-Duty Definition of <i>i</i>).  Without context,
it is hard to tell that the author meant &#34;there exists <i>i</i> such that
<i>i&lt;j</i> and <i>x<sub>i</sub>=x<sub>j</sub></i>&#34;.  Consider also &#34;The
number of nonneighbors is <i>n-1-d(u)≥ i</i>.&#34; The number of nonneighbors is
not an inequality, it is a number; the author is trying to make two statements
in one inequality.  For clarity, separate the statements: &#34;The number of
nonneighbors is <i>n-1-d(u)</i>, which is at least <i>i</i>&#34;.

</p><p>
<i>Exceptions.</i> Applying this principle with very simple expressions leads
to ponderous writing.  Here are two notable exceptions:
</p><p>
If the introductory part of the sentence is longer, then we may already have a
noun and a verb, and the expression again becomes a unit.  For example,
&#34;Include each vertex independently with probability <i>p=(</i>ln<i> n)/n</i>&#34;
should be &#34;Include each vertex independently with probability <i>p</i>, where
<i>p=(</i>ln<i> n)/n</i>&#34;.

</p></li><li>
<a name="commaformulas">
<i>Separation of formulas.</i>
Avoid placing two formulas consecutively, separated only by a comma.  For
example, &#34;For <i>x&lt;0</i>, <i>x²&gt;0</i>&#34; may be read as something other than
a hypothesis and a conclusion.  Similarly, &#34;For some <i>k</i> with
<i>k&lt;n</i>, <i>n-k+f(n)&lt;n/2</i>&#34; requires the reader to stop and go back
to insert the missing words.  The difficulty arises because commas occur also
in notation, and the eye cannot distinguish between commas that occur in
notation and commas that are intended to cause a pause or to substitute for
words.
The mathematics will be easier to read when the formulas are separated by the
comma plus words that enable the reader to understand the sentence at the first
reading.  Such phrases are &#34;it follows that&#34;, &#34;we have&#34;, etc.

<p>
[On the other hand, &#34;we have&#34; is an awkward phrase that often should be 
dropped when not needed to separate formulas.  For example, instead of
&#34;By the preceding theorem, we have <i>A=B</i>,&#34; prefer &#34;By the preceding
theorem, <i>A=B</i>&#34;.]

</p><p>
When the second formula just specifies an object, the separation can be
accomplished by specifying the type of object, as in &#34;When <i>k=2</i>, the
graph <i>G</i> is Eulerian&#34; instead of &#34;When <i>k=2</i>, <i>G</i> is Eulerian.&#34;
One can always rewrite notational expressions separated by a comma to avoid
the difficulty.  Usually this is easy, as in changing &#34;For every bipartite
graph <i>G</i>, <i>χ(G)≤2</i>&#34; to &#34;If <i>G</i> is bipartite, then
<i>χ(G)≤2</i>&#34;.

</p></a></li><li><a name="commaformulas">
</a><a name="initialnot">
<i>Initial notation.</i>
Never begin a sentence with notation.  Always one can prepend a specifier (such
as &#34;The graph <i>G</i> is&#34; instead of &#34;<i>G</i> is&#34;) or rewrite the sentence in
another way to avoid starting with notation.  Following this rule makes
mathematics easier to read.  The principle here is similar to the separation
of formulas.  An exception is that the statement of a numbered theorem may
begin (or be entirely) a formula, because the numbered designation serves as
a label that begins the sentence.

</a></li><li><a name="initialnot">
</a><a name="twoitems">
<i>Lists of size 2.</i>
It is common but ungrammatical to write &#34;Let <i>x,y</i> be vertices in
<i>G</i>&#34;; we would not write &#34;My friends John, Mary came to dinner.&#34;
The concatenation is an instance of two formulas separated by a comma.
To see what can go wrong, consider the following clause:
&#34;Since <i>a|b</i> and <i>a,b</i> are maximal and minimal,&#34;.
What was meant was:
&#34;Since <i>a|b</i>, with <i>a</i> maximal and <i>b</i> minimal,&#34;.
In general, the comma within a list of two elements should be replaced with
&#34;and&#34; when discussing the two elements as individual items.  For example, &#34;If
<i>x,y</i> are adjacent&#34; should be &#34;If <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are
adjacent&#34; or &#34;If <i>{x,y}</i> is a pair of adjacent vertices&#34;.


<p>
<i>Exceptions.</i>
With lists of size at least three, omission of &#34;and&#34; does not cause as much
confusion, and including it can be awkard.  Here the objection to the common
mathematical convention is much weaker: we accept &#34;Let <i>x,y,z</i> be the
vertices of <i>T</i>,&#34; although writing &#34;Let <i>{x,y,z}</i> be the vertex set
of <i>T</i>&#34; would be more precise.  Still, &#34;let <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and
<i>z</i> be the vertices&#34; reads better.

</p></a><p><a name="twoitems">
Another sensible exception is &#34;Choose <i>x,y∈ V(G)</i>&#34;.  Here the relation
is between each variable and the set, and we accept this as a single formula.
Again a justification is that we can read <i>∈</i> as the single word
&#34;in&#34;, without a verb.  Similarly, many mathematicians write, &#34;For
<i>n,m≥2</i>&#34; to mean the conjunction of <i>n≥2</i> and <i>m≥2</i>.
The exception for the membership symbol is consistent with other exceptions for
the membership symbol; doing it with inequalities is more questionable.  Avoid
doing it with equalities (see </a><a href="#varlist">Variable equal to list</a>).

it unnecessarily requires a pause for the reader to figure it out.
</p></li><li>
<a name="wordless">
<i>Parenthetic or wordless restrictions</i>.
Many writers of mathematics impose restrictions parenthetically or via commas,
thereby omitting words in sentences and juxtaposing formulas.  This makes
reading unnecessarily difficult.  Parentheses around notation are mathematical
objects and hence cannot substitute for words.  A phrase like &#34;Let
<i>m(m≤n)</i> be the size&#34; is immediately clear only to the author.

</a><p><a name="wordless">Other examples: &#34;Suppose there is an edge <i>xy (≠e)</i> in <i>G</i>&#34;
should be &#34;Suppose that <i>G</i> has an edge <i>xy</i> other than <i>e</i>&#34;.
Similarly, &#34;For <i>k≤m</i> with <i>k</i> even&#34;
improves on &#34;For <i>k≤m</i> (<i>k</i> even)&#34; or &#34;For <i>k≤m</i>, <i>k</i>
even&#34;, and &#34;Consider <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> for <i>1≤i≤n</i>&#34; is better
than &#34;Consider <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> (<i>1≤i≤n</i>)&#34;.  One can also
separate by putting words into the parentheses: &#34;For <i>k≤ m</i> (where
<i>k</i> is even)&#34;.  Note that &#34;Suppose that there is an edge <i>xy≠e</i> in
<i>G</i>&#34; is a </a><a href="#dblduty">Double-Duty Definition</a>; &#34;<i>xy≠e</i>&#34;
is not an edge.

</p></li><li>
<a name="mixingwords">
<i>Mixing words and notation.</i>
Words cannot be compared with notation via a relational symbol.  Do not write
&#34;Consider a graph <i>G</i> with maximum degree <i>≤ k</i>&#34;.  Grammatically,
the sentence does not indicate where the inequality starts.  If one side is
written in words, then the relation must also be written in words.
Furthermore, the sentence above says that the maximum degree of <i>G</i>
equals the expression &#34;<i>≤ k</i>&#34;.

<p>
The same principle applies to logical symbols.  In written mathematics, do not
use the symbols ∃,∀,⇒,iff) to substitute for words in
sentences.  Shorthand notation used to save space on lecture slides need not
follow these restrictions, since the slides summarize the lecture and are
accompanied by oral explanation.

<a name="hypothwds">
<i>Words of hypothesis: &#34;If&#34;, &#34;When&#34;, &#34;For&#34;, &#34;Since&#34;.</i>
For ease of understanding, a sentence that begins with &#34;If&#34; should later
have &#34;, then&#34; to start the conclusion.  The word &#34;then&#34; should not be omitted,
and a comma should precede it.  The comma can be omitted in a brief implication
contained within a clause already set off by a comma, as in &#34;Since <i>f</i> is
the squaring function, if <i>x=0</i> then <i>f(x)=0</i>&#34;.

<p>
When readability would be improved by omitting &#34;then&#34;, the sentence should
instead start with &#34;When&#34; or &#34;For&#34;, as in this sentence itself.  A comma still
follows the condition introduced by &#34;When&#34; or &#34;For&#34;.  The structure of a
sentence beginning with &#34;Since&#34; is like those beginning with &#34;When&#34; or &#34;For&#34;; a
comma follows the first clause.  After &#34;Since&#34; or &#34;Because&#34;, the concluding
clause <i>cannot</i> begin with &#34;then&#34; or &#34;so&#34;; &#34;then&#34; is used only with &#34;If&#34;.

</p></a></li><li><a name="hypothwds">
</a><a name="asfor">
<i>&#34;As&#34; and &#34;For&#34; introducing reasons.</i>
In English, the words &#34;as&#34; and &#34;for&#34; may be used to introduce a reason given
after the statement of the conclusion from that reason.  For example:
&#34;I ate early today, for I was hungry,&#34; or &#34;He stopped writing his answer, as
time had expired.&#34;  Banish these uses from mathematical writing; they introduce
confusion, especially for non-native readers.  &#34;As&#34; also means &#34;like&#34;, and
&#34;for&#34; is most often used to specify a universe.  Compare &#34;The degree is at
least one, for a vertex in the neighborhood&#34; with &#34;The degree is at least one,
for a vertex in the neighborhood is not isolated.&#34;  The meanings of &#34;for&#34;
differ, but the reader does not discover that until the end of the sentence.

</a><a name="conclwds">
<i>Words of conclusion: &#34;Hence&#34;, &#34;Thus&#34;, &#34;Therefore&#34;</i>
A long proof does not fit in a single sentence; hence often one needs a word
to start a sentence that states a conclusion.  Among the choices are
&#34;Therefore&#34;, &#34;Hence&#34;, and &#34;Thus&#34;.  Purists (and copy editors) desire a comma
after every such introductory word or phrase (as they do after &#34;Finally&#34;, &#34;On
the other hand&#34;, &#34;In 1965&#34;, etc.).  This can make language overly formal.

<p>
Among these choices, I treat &#34;Therefore&#34; as the most formal, introducing a
major conclusion and hence taking a comma.  Because &#34;Hence&#34; and &#34;Thus&#34; are
single syllables, I use them without commas to indicate the flow of argument
without making the writing choppy.  This choice modifies strict English
punctuation in the service of mathematical understanding.  It is not incorrect
to put commas after all these introductory words, but it enhances mathematical
communication to omit the commas after short words introducing short
conclusions that are just a step along the way.  Copy editors put in the
commas, and I insist that they be removed again.

<i>&#34;by theorem X&#34;.</i>
Consider the sentence &#34;Since <i>G</i> has at least <i>3n-5</i> edges, by
Theorem X, we know that <i>G</i> is not planar.&#34;  Does Theorem X imply
that <i>G</i> has at least <i>3n-5</i> edges or that <i>G</i> is not planar?
Since the reader will not know the author&#39;s intent, &#34;by Theorem X&#34; should
not be placed between a reason and a conclusion without clearer indication
of which meaning is intended.  Dropping one comma makes it clearer, as in
&#34;Since <i>G</i> has at least <i>3n-5</i> edges, by Theorem X we know that
<i>G</i> is not planar&#34; or &#34;Since <i>G</i> has at least <i>3n-5</i> edges
by Theorem X, we know that <i>G</i> is not planar&#34;.  However, the second option
can be written better as &#34;By Theorem X, <i>G</i> has at least <i>3n-5</i>
edges, and therefore <i>G</i> is not planar&#34;.  Alternatively, a reader
suggested using parentheses, as in &#34;Note that <i>G</i> has at least <i>3n-5</i>

</a><a name="sothat">
<i>&#34;So&#34; and &#34;so that&#34;.</i>
Because of its other uses in English, &#34;So&#34; is too informal to introduce a
sentence of conclusion (with or without being followed by a comma).  It is best
to reserve &#34;so&#34; for use as a conjunction, like &#34;but&#34;: &#34;The graph is connected,
so each vertex is reachable from every other vertex.&#34;  In this usage, no word
is needed to introduce the reason that precedes the conclusion.
As a </a><a href="#conjunctions">conjunction</a>, &#34;so&#34; is preceded by a comma, not a
semicolon: &#34;The graph has no odd cycles, so it is bipartite.&#34;  This form is
best used when the conclusion is short.  <i>When &#34;so&#34; is used as a conjunction,
there is no &#34;that&#34;</i>.  Thus &#34;We have <i>x²=0</i>, so that <i>x=0</i>&#34;

&#34;So that&#34; means &#34;in such a way that&#34;.  Use &#34;such that&#34; when imposing a
condition on an object and &#34;so that&#34; when performing an action in a certain
way.  That is, &#34;so that&#34; requires a verb and describes how the action is done,
while &#34;such that&#34; restricts a noun.  Compare &#34;Consider a graph such that no

the same color.  What follows &#34;such that&#34; modifies &#34;graph&#34;, but what follows

</a><a name="suppose">
<i>&#34;Assume&#34;, &#34;Suppose&#34;, and &#34;Let&#34;</i>
A statement that is <i>assumed</i> is an axiom, considered throughout to be
true.  Something <i>supposed</i> is a hypothesis.  Hence &#34;Suppose&#34; or &#34;Suppose
that&#34; is more appropriate to introduce a case or an argument by contradiction.
In contrast, &#34;we may assume&#34; introduces a consequence of an argument or
symmetry and henceforth will be true.  I do not really understand the
phrase <i>&#34;Assume for a contradiction that&#34;</i>; use &#34;Suppose to the contrary
that&#34;.  Similarly, do not use the incomprehensible &#34;By way of contradiction&#34;;
a possibility is &#34;Toward a contradiction, suppose that&#34;.

<p>
<i>&#34;Suppose&#34; vs. &#34;Suppose that&#34;.</i>
After words of hypothesis or conclusion (&#34;suppose&#34;, &#34;assume&#34;, &#34;implies&#34;, 
&#34;conclude&#34;, etc), use &#34;that&#34; when what follows is a clause with an English
verb.  Omit &#34;that&#34; when what follows is just a noun unit, such as a notional
expression.  For example, &#34;Assume the hypothesis&#34; is a complete sentence with
imperative verb and object.  The structure is the same in &#34;Suppose
<i>x+y≤10</i>&#34;.  When an English verb follows, we have &#34;Suppose that
<i>f</i> is a proper coloring&#34;.

</p><p>
This distinction is a matter of some debate.  Some more formal authors use
&#34;Suppose that&#34; when what follows is a formula containing a relational symbol,
treating the symbol as a verb.  I think it is better to maintain the
consistency of treating formulas as noun units.  The clarification accomplished
by &#34;that&#34; when a verb follows become unnecessary when the clause is condensed
into notation.  When the notation is displayed, its role as a fact (noun) is

In spoken English, we usually drop &#34;that&#34; in this conntext to avoid ponderous

reasonable to drop &#34;that&#34;.  For example, &#34;Suppose the hypothesis is true&#34; would

<i>Universal quantifiers.</i>
The word &#34;any&#34; can mean &#34;some&#34; or &#34;all&#34; in different contexts, so it can
be imprecise.  It is clearer to use &#34;each&#34; or &#34;every&#34; as a universal
quantifier when referring to a singular object.


<p>
Numbered plural variables cause difficulty.  In English, &#34;for every two
elements&#34; is awkward because &#34;every&#34; is singular.  Thus here it is better to
say &#34;for any two elements&#34;.  The presence of &#34;for&#34; is suggestive of the
universal quantification and helps avoid ambiguity.  Confusion can still arise:
consider &#34;Form <i>G&#39;</i> from <i>G</i> by adding an edge joining any two
vertices with distance 2 in <i>G</i>.&#34;  Here some readers will think that only
one edge is added.

Avoiding &#34;any&#34; is not imperative.  Evaluate its use in context, making sure
to prevent misinterpretation.  &#34;Any&#34; is a good substitute for &#34;an arbitrary&#34;,

(&#34;arbitrary&#34; indicates that all ways of making the choice are allowed.)

</p><p>
Using an indefinite article (&#34;a&#34; or &#34;an&#34;) as a universal quantifier can be
dangerous, as in &#34;Prove that a bipartite graph has no odd cycle.&#34;  Some readers
(often students) may interpret &#34;a&#34; as &#34;one&#34; or &#34;some&#34;, turning universality
into existence.  Using &#34;every&#34; is clearer.  Putting &#34;must&#34; before the

<i>Numerals and spelled numbers.</i>
In standard English writing, numbers less than 10 usually are spelled in full,
while numbers more than 10 are written in numerals.  In mathematical writing,
the basis for the distinction is different.  Numbers less than 10 are spelled
out only when used as adjectives expressing the quantity of objects in a set.
They must remain as numerals when designating the value that a quantity equals.
For example, &#34;The two vertices both have degree 3&#34; or &#34;A cycle of length 4 has
four edges&#34; or &#34;Consider a 4-vertex path&#34; or &#34;Consider a path with four

For many reasons, the colon &#34;:&#34; is a far better choice than the vertical bar &#34;|&#34;
to mean &#34;such that&#34; in a &#34;notation/condition&#34; definition for a set.  For
example, we may write &#34;{<i>3n+1: n∈</i><b>N</b>}&#34;.  The vertical bar
is heavily used in mathematics, most notably for size of sets, but also for
divisibility and other purposes.  Using it for this purpose leads to such
messes as &#34;{<i>|A|||A|||B|</i>}&#34;, which purports to describe the set of
sizes of sets <i>A</i> whose size divides the size of <i>B</i>.  The colon is
far less used in mathematics.  Even so, the best reason for using the colon is
that this mathematical usage is similar to the meaning of the character in
English; it separates part of a sentence from some elaboration of that part.
Finally, since &#34;such that&#34; is not a binary operator, this usage should be
expressed in TeX using &#34;\colon\,&#34; instead of &#34;:&#34;.  As in English,

<i>Sequences, series, and lists.</i>
In mathematics, a sequence is a function whose domain is the set of natural

abuse this term in using it for an ordered finite set.  A good name for such an
object is <i>list</i>.  An <i>n</i>-tuple is a list of length <i>n</i>.  It is
an abuse of terminology to say &#34;a sequence of length <i>n</i>&#34;.
(For finite graphs, in particular, &#34;degree sequence&#34; should be changed to

We never use <i>f</i> to denote the value of a function <i>f</i> at a point

For example, the maximum degree of a graph <i>G</i> is denoted
<i>Δ(G)</i>.  Here <i>Δ</i> is a function, not a number, and hence
<i>Δ</i> should not be used to denote the value of the function
<i>Δ</i> on a particular graph.

<p>
It is tempting for mnemonic reasons to write &#34;We write <i>V=V(G)</i> and
<i>Δ=Δ(G)</i>&#34;.  Admittedly, this usage is not confusing when
discussing only one graph at a time; the difference between a graph invariant
and a real-valued function is that we rarely focus on the value of a real-valued
function at just one point.  Nevertheless, it is rare that a paper discusses
only one graph, and hence it is better to use <i>V(G)</i> and <i>Δ(G)</i>
for objects associated with <i>G</i>.  The problem is particularly bad with
<i>Δ</i>, since this character also occurs in mathematics as a difference
operator.  One often sees &#34;<i>Δn</i>&#34; meaning the change in the value of
<i>n</i>, so one should not use &#34;<i>Δn</i>&#34; to mean the maximum degree
times the number of vertices in a graph.  (In my textbook I violated this
principle by using <i>n(G)</i> and <i>e(G)</i> for the numbers of vertices and

a particular graph and <i>e</i> as a particular edge; the error will be

<i>Hyphens for parameters.</i>
The expression &#34;<i>k</i> connected graphs&#34; refers to <i>k</i> graphs that are

the property of being <i>k</i>-connected.  Note also that an expression
involving addition or subtraction used as a parameter modifying a noun
should be enclosed in parentheses before the hyphen.  For example, write
&#34;<i>(k+1)</i>-connected graph&#34;, not &#34;<i>k+1</i>-connected graph&#34;.

This hyphenation rule applies whenever notation is used to modify or 
further specify the subsequent word.  Examples include &#34;<i>k</i>-cycle&#34;,
&#34;<i>n</i>-vertex graph&#34;, &#34;<i>p</i>-group&#34;, etc.

A related hyphenation issue is particularly important in graph theory.
A &#34;<i>k</i>-edge connected graph&#34; is a connected graph with <i>k</i> edges
(compare with &#34;<i>n</i>-vertex connected graph&#34;); the meaning is different
from &#34;<i>k</i>-edge-connected graph&#34;.  When the hyphen is missing,
&#34;<i>k</i>-edge&#34; modifies &#34;connected graph&#34; because adjectives modify only
nouns, not other adjectives.  Similarly, a non-specialist reader would think
that a <i>k</i>-edge coloring is a coloring of <i>k</i>-edges, not a coloring
of edges using <i>k</i> colors.  This example can be viewed as following

<i>Vertex vs. edge terminology.</i>
In graph theory, many fundamental concepts involving vertices have analogues

&#34;connectivity&#34; or &#34;chromatic number&#34;, but we add &#34;edge&#34; for the analogous edge
concept.  We then hyphenate &#34;edge-connectivity&#34; and &#34;edge-chromatic number&#34;.
In both cases, the problem for edges is a special case (for line graphs) of the
general problem.

<p>
Furthermore, using the hyphen in the edge context maintains
consistency with the needed usage explained in the preceding item.
When comparing &#34;edge-coloring&#34; and &#34;list coloring&#34;, we are not coloring the
lists, so the hyphenation of the term is different.

</p><p>
The presence of the word &#34;vertex&#34; sometimes becomes an issue.  As mentioned
above, the fundamental parameters involve vertices and do not require the word
&#34;vertex&#34; as a modifier.  Similarly, when we speak of &#34;disjoint subgraphs&#34;, it
must be that they cannot share anything, vertices or edges, so the word
&#34;vertex&#34; is unnecessary.  The concept &#34;edge-disjoint&#34; indicates a less
restrictive condition.  Saying &#34;vertex disjoint&#34; suggests vertices as an
alternative to edges; it is better just to say &#34;disjoint&#34;.  Clearly disjoint

in the hyphenated term differs from the English usage of &#34;well&#34; is the

Traditionally, the terms &#34;order&#34; and &#34;size&#34; refer to the number of vertices

It must be admitted that &#34;order&#34; and &#34;size&#34; are quite convenient, while overuse

Introducing notation for the numbers of vertices and edges minimizes this
difficulty.  Unfortunately, there is no generally agreed notation for operators
returning the numbers of vertices and edges of a graph <i>G</i>.  The only
notation that cannot be misunderstood is the absence of special notation:
<i>|V(G)|</i> and <i>|E(G)|</i>, using notation for cardinality of finite
sets that is standard throughout mathematics.  Nevertheless, these expressions

<i>Graphs are not sets.</i>
When <i>h</i> is a vertex in a graph <i>G</i>, it makes no sense to write

and <i>e∈ E(G)</i>.  This is also a reason why the convenient notations
<i>|G|</i> and <i>||G||</i> for the order and size of a graph are problematic.
When one sees <i>|G|</i>, how does one know whether it is the number of
vertices or the number of edges?

<p>On the other hand, it is true that we write <i>G-v</i> and <i>G-e</i> for
deletion of a vertex <i>v</i> or edge <i>e</i> from a graph <i>G</i>, defining
&#34;<i>-</i>&#34; in the context of the objects it operates on.  In this sense, it
would also be legitimate to define the meaning of the cardinality and norm

widespread support for this usage, it seems wisest to stick to the notation
<i>|V(G)|</i> and <i>|E(G)|</i> that is understood by all mathematicians.

When <i>A⊆V(G)</i>, it is clear that <i>|A|</i> is the size of the vertex

<i>A</i>.

<i>Directed graphs and hypergraphs</i>.
These models are variations or generalizations of graphs.
In a digraph, the edge set consists of ordered pairs.  The redundancy of
saying &#34;directed edge&#34; or &#34;directed path&#34; or &#34;directed cycle&#34; is not helpful,
as it suggests that the digraph contains such objects that are not directed
(the term &#34;weak path&#34; is available for a path in the underlying undirected
graph).  Unnecessarily adding the adjective &#34;directed&#34; in a context where
the default should incorporate that notion also prevents making statements
that hold in the context of both graphs and digraphs, like Menger&#39;s Theorem.

<p>
Similarly, one should not use &#34;hyperedges&#34; to refer to the edges of a
hypergraph.  Hypergraphs generalize graphs by allowing edges to have arbitrary
size.  Calling them &#34;hyperedges&#34; eliminates the possibility of saying that
graphs arise as a special case, since graphs have edges, not hyperedges.

Unnecessary redundancy has similar disadvantages.  We should not speak of the

<i>&#34;Maximal&#34; vs. &#34;maximum&#34;.</i>
Many mathematicians use these words interchangeably.  One can make a useful
distinction by using &#34;maximum&#34; to compare numbers or sizes and &#34;maximal&#34; to
compare sets or other objects.  Thus a <i>maximal</i> object of type <i>A</i>
is an object of type <i>A</i> that is not contained in any other object of type
<i>A</i>.  A <i>maximum</i> object of type <i>A</i> is a largest object of type
<i>A</i>; here &#34;maximum&#34; is an abbreviation for &#34;maximum-sized&#34;.  For example,
in a graph we may speak of &#34;maximal independent sets&#34; and &#34;maximum independent
sets&#34;; these are convenient terms for distinct concepts that are both important.

<p>
Although this distinction is sensible and has become established in many
settings (such as &#34;maximum antichain&#34; and &#34;maximum independent set&#34;), potential
confusion can be reduced by using &#34;largest&#34; and &#34;smallest&#34; instead of &#34;maximum&#34;
and &#34;minimum&#34;.  For example, it is harder to misinterpret &#34;a largest matching&#34;
than to misinterpret &#34;a maximum matching&#34;.

</p><p>
For consistency, then, one should not write &#34;a vertex of maximal degree&#34; or
&#34;the maximal number of edges&#34;; that is, &#34;maximal&#34; should not be applied to
numerical values.  This is consistent with usage in continuous mathematics,
where we write that a continuous function &#34;attains its maximum&#34; on a closed
and bounded set.

A different problem arises in the induction step.  When we cite the induction

<i>Cliques vs. complete subgraphs.</i>
In an earlier era, these terms were used interchangeably in graph theory, but
it is more useful to distinguish them.  There is a difference between a set of
pairwise adjacent vertices in a graph (complementary to an independent set of
vertices) and a subgraph isomorphic to a complete graph.  Both concepts are
needed, and the appropriate terms for them are &#34;clique&#34; and &#34;complete
subgraph&#34;.  Thus &#34;clique&#34; should be reserved for a set of vertices, and then
the meanings of &#34;clique of size 5&#34; and &#34;5-clique&#34; (the same) are clear.  In
previous centuries, also &#34;clique&#34; was sometimes used to mean &#34;maximal clique&#34;,

<i>Isomorphism classes vs. subgraphs.</i>
A graph is a pair consisting of a vertex set and an edge set.  Paths, cycles,
and complete graphs are graphs whose edge sets are described in specific ways.
The notations <i>P<sub>n</sub></i>, <i>C<sub>n</sub></i>, and
<i>K<sub>n</sub></i> do not distinguish a particular set of vertices, and hence
in specifying paths, cycles, and complete graphs they must refer to the
isomorphism classes.

<p>
Hence we should never write &#34;a <i>P<sub>n</sub></i>&#34; for a member of that class.
We can write that a graph &#34;contains a path with <i>n</i> vertices&#34;,
because that is a structural description of the subgraph, but we cannot write
&#34;contains a <i>P<sub>n</sub></i>&#34; or &#34;consider a <i>P<sub>n</sub></i> in
<i>G</i>&#34;.  We can say &#34;contains ten copies of <i>P<sub>n</sub></i>&#34; to refer
to subgraphs that are <i>n</i>-vertex paths; each such subgraph is a member of
the isomorphism class denoted by <i>P<sub>n</sub></i>.

</p><p>
Neverthless, some flexibility is helpful here.  When <i>H</i> is the notation
for an isomorphism class, we still write &#34;<i>H⊆G</i>&#34; to mean that some
subgraph of <i>G</i> belongs to the isomorphism class or is &#34;isomorphic to
<i>H</i>&#34; (or &#34;<i>G</i> contains a copy of <i>H</i>&#34;), even though we are not
specifying the particular vertices or edges of <i>G</i> used in the subgraph.

<i>Proper coloring.</i>
A <i>k-coloring</i> (or <i>k</i>-edge-coloring) of a graph is a partition of
the vertices (or edges, respectively) into <i>k</i> classes.  In combinatorics
generally, a <i>k</i>-coloring of a set partitions it into <i>k</i> classes,
arbitrarily.  This general concept appears in many areas of mathematics, 
including Ramsey theory, graph decomposition, and chromatic numbers.  In the
latter context, a <i>proper [edge-]coloring</i> is one in which adjacent [or
incident] elements do not receive the same color.

<p>
Some authors who write extensively about chromatic number and edge-chromatic
number drop the word &#34;proper&#34; and use <i>k-[edge-]coloring</i> for the
restricted concept.  The minor convenience gained by dropping this word is
overwhelmed by the negative influence of introducing inconsistency of
terminology in combinatorics.  Use &#34;proper <i>k</i>-coloring&#34; when that is what
is meant.  For other variations, such as &#34;acyclic <i>k</i>-coloring&#34; or
&#34;dynamic <i>k</i>-coloring&#34;, the adjectives replace &#34;proper&#34; by imposing
further restrictions on the <i>k</i>-coloring, so the word &#34;proper&#34; is then no

<i>Partitions vs. parts</i>
A partition consists of blocks or &#34;parts&#34;.  Do not use &#34;partition&#34; to refer

<p>A <i>bipartition</i> is a partition into two parts.  In particular,
we say that a bipartition of a bipartite graph is a partition of its vertex
set into two independent sets.  In the past I used &#34;partite sets&#34; to refer
to the parts of such a partition, but there are objections to that term,
and students never get it (for example, they refer to one &#34;partite&#34; of a graph,
and certainly &#34;partite&#34; is not a noun.  Hence I now refer to the &#34;parts&#34; of
a bipartite graph.  This is a slight abuse of terminology, but I think its

<i>&#34;Pairwise&#34; and &#34;mutually&#34;.</i>
Old-fashioned mathematics took the old-fashioned word &#34;mutually&#34; to describe
a binary relation satisfied by all pairs in a set, as in &#34;a set of mutually
orthogonal Latin squares&#34;.  In English usage, &#34;mutual&#34; indicates symmetry in
a more global way.  Hence modern mathematics should avoid using &#34;mutually&#34; 
to mean &#34;pairwise&#34;; the word &#34;pairwise&#34; states exactly what is meant.  The
change becomes even more important in light of modern terms like &#34;mutual
independence&#34; in which &#34;mutual&#34; explicitly does not mean &#34;pairwise&#34;.  (Thus
&#34;mutually orthogonal Latin squares&#34; is now ambiguous, but we cannot escape the

The phrase &#34;Consider disjoint sets <i>A<sub>1</sub>,…A<sub>k</sub></i>&#34;

However, this is a universally understood abuse of terminology, and including
the word &#34;pairwise&#34; each time would be ponderous.  Hence we understand a
family of disjoint sets to be pairwise disjoint.  The point is that many
binary relations really make sense essentially only in a binary context.
This principle extends to other commonly used binary relations do not make
non-binary sense, such as &#34;isomorphic&#34;.

<i>Disjoint union vs. join.</i>
In much of graph theory, the notation <i>rG</i> indicates a graph consisting of
<i>r</i> disjoint copies of <i>G</i>.  For consistency, <i>G+H</i> should
therefore denote the disjoint union of two graphs <i>G</i> and <i>H</i>.
For example, <i>P<sub>n<sub>1</sub></sub>+…+P<sub>n<sub>k</sub></sub></i>
denotes a linear forest, consisting of <i>k</i> components that are paths with
orders <i>n<sub>1</sub>,…,n<sub>k</sub></i>.

<p>
Some authors use <i>G+H</i> instead (or also!) to denote the <i>join</i> of
<i>G</i> and <i>H</i>, which consists of the disjoint union plus edges
joining every vertex of <i>G</i> to every vertex of <i>H</i>.  Other notation
has been used, such as <i>G</i>∨<i>H</i>, borrowing the join operation
(<i>x∨y</i>) in lattices or logic, but this is not satisfactory.
Instead the best notation for the graph join is \diamondplus (unavailable
in html?) which overstrikes a diamond and a plus, much like &#34;⊕&#34; except
with a rotated square whose corners are at the points of the &#34;+&#34;
(&#34;⊕&#34; is unavailable because it represents symmetric difference
or binary sum).  The \diamondplus is consistent with the Nesetril notation
for graph products: the symbol is a picture of the result of applying the
operation to two copies of <i>K<sub>2</sub></i>.  In addition, the use of
&#34;+&#34; indicates that the number of vertices is additive.

<i>Quotations and ends of sentences.</i>
It is traditional correct style in English grammar that all terminal

was to lessen the danger of breakage of fixed metal type in printing presses.
In the era of electronic publishing of mathematics, this justification is
obsolete, and we can replace the convention with logical punctuation.  When the
material being quoted is treated as an item within the sentence and is not
itself a sentence, the terminal punctuation logically comes outside the
quotation marks.  Copy editors trained in literary punctuation still object to

When using &#34;which&#34;, &#34;that&#34;, &#34;where&#34;, or other words to introduce

has no crossings.  Making the comment on crossings apply to the embedding
requires rewriting: &#34;On a specified surface, consider an embedding of <i>G</i>,

<i>&#34;Every&#34;, &#34;distinct&#34;, and &#34;unique&#34;.</i>

The word &#34;distinct&#34; has the same meaning as &#34;different&#34;.  Two things
can be distinct, but one thing cannot be distinct.  Thus the sentence &#34;Every

think it means that each value is different from every other value, but it does
not.

</p><p> The word &#34;unique&#34; indicates that there is only one of the items being

Some students think that &#34;The function <i>f</i> maps the points in <i>A</i> to

<i>Abstract nouns and articles.</i>
Nouns that specify abstract concepts rather than objects need no articles.  For
example, &#34;graph colorability&#34; is an indefinite concept, so we do not say &#34;Next
we discuss the graph colorability&#34;.  In contrast, &#34;chromatic number&#34; may be
abstract or specific.  We may say &#34;Next we discuss chromatic number&#34;, referring
to the general concept, or &#34;Next we discuss the chromatic number of this
graph&#34;, since this graph has only one value as its chromatic number.

<p>
Functions or parameters assign a number to each domain object.  The resulting
value is specific for the object; there is only one choice for it.  Hence we
do not say &#34;the graph has a chromatic number 3&#34; or &#34;the vertex has a degree 3&#34;.
These sentences suggest that the object may have more than one value of the
parameter.   The answer to the question &#34;What is the degree of this vertex?&#34;
may be &#34;This vertex has degree 3&#34;, but it cannot be &#34;This vertex has a degree
3&#34;.

</p><p>
We also do not say &#34;This vertex has the degree 3&#34;, although &#34;The degree of this
vertex is 3&#34; is correct.  Consider the sentence &#34;Every graph has an even number
of vertices with odd degree, which means that the list of vertex degrees has
even sum.&#34; The term &#34;even number&#34; takes the article &#34;an&#34; because we are saying
which type of number is being used (it is one of the even numbers).  The later
&#34;odd degree&#34; and &#34;even sum&#34; do not, because these are properties that the
vertices and the list do or do not satisfy.  Articles are inappropriate when
invoking a property.

</p><p>
Articles also are not used with conceptual nouns.  Compare with familiar
conversation: we say &#34;This chair has value $100&#34; and not &#34;This chair has the
value
$100.&#34; &#34;Value&#34; and &#34;degree&#34; are abstract properties.  Here is another
non-mathematical example: We say &#34;I receive compensation for my work,&#34;
not &#34;I receive a compensation for my work.&#34; Compensation is an amount, but here
only the abstract concept of receiving compensation is meant, not some number
of things.  Hence we do not use an article.

</p><p>
Similarly, abstract properties do not take articles.  We say &#34;because
transitivity of A implies transitivity of B&#34;, not &#34;because the transitivity of
A implies the transitivity of B&#34;.  The property in question is &#34;transitivity&#34;,
not &#34;the transitivity&#34;.

<i>Possessives and titles.</i>
The definite article &#34;the&#34; specifies uniqueness.  Possessives also play this
role.  It is incorrect to use both together, because the possessive already
provides definite specification.  For example, we write &#34;Greene&#39;s Theorem&#34;
but not &#34;the Greene&#39;s Theorem&#34;; this is a theorem proved by Greene, not by
&#34;the Greene&#34;.

<p>
When discussing a result by two authors, we cannot put possessives on both
names, because there is only one object (compare with &#34;Greene&#39;s and Kleitman&#39;s
theorems&#34;).  Making only the second name possessive would be correct in English
grammar but poor mathematical style (&#34;Greene and Kleitman&#39;s Theorem&#34;, like
&#34;Dick and Jane&#39;s house).  The main reason this is poor mathematical style
is that the entire phrase is a title.  Hence we write &#34;the Greene--Kleitman
Theorem&#34;, like &#34;the Woolbright-Abernathy House&#34;.  Here &#34;the&#34; serves as a
definite article for the unique object with the title &#34;Greene--Kleitman
Theorem&#34;.  When the result is less celebrated and not known by its authors&#39;
names, one can indicate the possessive by &#34;of&#34;, as in &#34;the theorem of Greene

In the examples above, &#34;Theorem&#34; is capitalized.  When there is only one

Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality&#34;.  Although some style sheets vote against
capitalization based on &#34;common usage&#34;, failing to capitalize does not

Some graph theorists use &#34;Hamilton cycle&#34; to mean a spanning cycle in a graph,

Two clauses (in essence, two complete sentences) may be combined using a

conjunctions are &#34;and&#34;, &#34;but&#34;, &#34;then&#34;, and &#34;so&#34; (the latter should be treated
as conjunctions in mathematical writing).  Since a conjunction joins two
things, sentences should not begin with these words.  This is a logical
approach that helps keep writing clear, though strict English usage (especially
British) may call some of these words adverbs.  See further comments on the use

The situation is more complicated when the second clause itself contains a
conjunction.  Compare &#34;If A, then B holds and C holds&#34; with &#34;If A, then B
holds, and C holds&#34;.  In the first sentence, it is clear that A implies both B
and C.  The proper grouping or meaning in the second sentence is unclear.

Compound sentences consist of two complete sentences with no conjunction

before a conjunction; in particular, there should never be a semicolon before
&#34;and&#34;, &#34;but&#34;, &#34;then&#34;, or &#34;so&#34;.

<i>Excessive commas.</i>
A clause requires a subject and a verb.  When &#34;and&#34; joins two parts of a
sentence that do not both stand on their own with a subject and a verb, there
should be no comma before it.  The comma in &#34;We will prove the lemma, and then
the theorem&#34; is incorrect; one must delete the comma or add a subject and
verb to the second part.  This example came from a newspaper: &#34;In February,
the graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering, was awarded the
A--B--C Prize&#34;; here there should be no comma before &#34;was&#34;.  (See further
examples of excessive commas in </a><a href="#definitions">Definitions</a>.)

<a name="serialcomma">
<i>Serial commas.</i> A serial comma is a comma after the next-to-last element
of a list.  Wikipedia gives a </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma">discussion</a> of its use.  It
is generally safest to use a comma in this situation.  For example, compare
&#34;Under the conditions <i>1≤ i,k≤ r</i> and <i>m</i> even&#34; with
&#34;Under the conditions <i>1≤ i</i>, <i>k≤ r</i>, and <i>m</i> even&#34;;
the two sentences have different meanings.  The issue arises often when
listing three mathematical objects or three authors.  (For a list of lists,
clarity can be achieved by using semicolons or by changing &#34;and&#34; to &#34;&amp;&#34; within
list items.)

<p>
One reason for using the serial comma in lists is to avoid confusion in
sentences that do not contain lists.  Consider the sentences
&#34;Like <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> have the same property&#34; and
&#34;Later, Early and Jones proved the conjecture&#34;.  These are not lists, and using
a comma would be wrong, but when a document does not use serial commas these
examples initially appear to be lists.  Similarly, in that context an item in a
list that itself joins two subitems with &#34;and&#34; looks like the last two items in
a list.

</p><p>
Omitting the serial comma can also cause confusion mathematically, as in
&#34;The value of <i>f</i> is positive at 2, negative at 1 and 0 at 0.&#34;

</p></li><li>
<a name="appositive">
<i>Appositives.</i></a> An appositive is a noun or noun phrase that renames or
substitutes for another noun or noun phrase immediately preceding or following
it.  It can be recognized by the fact that omitting it would yield a clear and
complete sentence and that the additional information in it is not
grammatically essential to the statement being made.  It should be set off by
commas:  &#34;His book, the best book on the subject, took years to write.  An
appositive in the middle of a sentence cannot have a comma on only one side.

<p>
When an appositive is short enough or contains essential information, the
commas are omitted: &#34;My friend Bob is a student.&#34;  In mathematical writing, a
similar situation applies when notation is introduced:  &#34;The <i>degree</i>
<i>d(v)</i> of a vertex <i>v</i> is the number of neighbors of <i>v</i>.&#34;  Here
&#34;<i>d(v)</i>&#34; is a brief appositive.  One could argue that the notation for
&#34;degree&#34; is not essential to the sense of the sentence, but putting commas
around very short appositives can produce very choppy sentences.  A speaker
need not pause for such appositives, and hence one may omit the commas.

<a name="passive">
<i>Passive voice.</i>
Good writers of English minimize the use of passive voice.  This accepted
principle applies also in writing mathematics.  Active verbs make the
exposition more engaging; for example, &#34;It suffices to show&#34; is preferable
to &#34;It is sufficient to show&#34;.  Nevertheless, judicious use of the passive
voice can be appropriate.

</a><a name="thebelow">
<i>&#34;Above&#34; and &#34;Below&#34;.</i>
These words are adverbs; they do not directly modify nouns.  Hence &#34;the above
graph&#34; and &#34;the below figure&#34; are incorrect.  We can write &#34;the graph above&#34;
or &#34;the figure below&#34; as a short form for &#34;the graph shown above&#34; or
&#34;the figure located below&#34;.

</a></li><li><a name="thebelow">

<i>&#34;We have been proving&#34;</i>
Do not use the &#34;perfect&#34; tenses, which involve the helping word &#34;have&#34;.
Phrases like &#34;In Section 3 we have been analyzing&#34; or &#34;in [4] we had shown&#34;
are either grammatically wrong or confusing.  The simple tenses, as in
&#34;In Section 3 we analyzed&#34; or &#34;in [4] we showed&#34;, are almost always better.
Even the future can be eliminated: &#34;in Section 4 we show&#34; rather than
&#34;in Section 4 we will show&#34;; the justification for this is viewing the entire
article as a unit, happening in the present.

</a><a name="non">
<i>Words containing &#34;non&#34;.</i>
When a word in English initially has a negation introduced by prefixing &#34;non&#34;,
the resulting word is hyphenated.  The initial sense is the negation, so the
hyphen is appropriate.  As decades pass and the word is accepted on its own,
it becomes a positive concept incorporating the &#34;non&#34;.  This and familiarity
lead to dropping the hyphen.  Some of the most familiar examples in mathematics
are &#34;nonsingular&#34;, &#34;nontrivial&#34;, &#34;nonzero&#34;, and &#34;nonconstructive&#34;.  Adding
hyphens to these words is now jarring to more readers than is the absence of
hyphens.  I also use &#34;nonempty&#34;, &#34;nonnegative&#34;, &#34;nonneighor&#34;, and &#34;nonadjacent&#34;.
However, I would keep the hyphen in &#34;non-word&#34; and &#34;non-edge&#34;, for clarity
and infrequency.

Many non-native speakers use &#34;bound of&#34; when they mean &#34;bound on&#34;.
If <i>x≤ k</i>, then we have an upper bound of <i>k</i> on <i>x</i>.  Using
&#34;bound of <i>x</i>&#34; for &#34;bound on <i>x</i>&#34; can become confusing when comparing
parameters.  We do not want to say that the maximum degree <i>Δ(G)</i> is
a bound of the chromatic number <i>χ(G)</i>; when <i>Δ(G)=k</i> we
want to say that <i>Δ(G)</i> establishes a bound <i>of</i> <i>k</i>
<i>on</i> the chromatic number of the graph.  (Writers from Asia typically
overuse the preposition &#34;of&#34; when many others are more accurate, such as
&#34;on&#34;, &#34;for&#34;, &#34;about&#34;, etc.)

The sentence &#34;In this paper we prove few good results&#34; means that the

<i>&#34;Usual&#34;.</i>
It is a quirk of English that the word &#34;usual&#34; as an adjective usually requires
the definite article &#34;the&#34;.  We cannot say &#34;In this section we consider only
usual chromatic number&#34;; it must be &#34;In this section we consider only the usual

In English, we do not say that one result is a &#34;partial case&#34; of another.
We say that it is a &#34;special case&#34;.  (This is an issue of translation from one
language to another.)  However, it is correct to say that proving a special
case of a conjecture is a partial result.

</a><a name="pass">
<i>&#34;Pass&#34; vs. &#34;Pass through&#34;.</i>
In English, the word &#34;pass&#34; means &#34;go by without entering&#34;.  Thus a path that
passes a vertex does not visit that vertex.  To say that path <i>P</i> visits
vertex <i>v</i>, one should say that <i>P</i> <i>passes through</i> <i>v</i>
(this is a language translation issue).  Better yet, just use &#34;visits&#34;.

<i>&#34;Can not&#34; and &#34;may be&#34;.</i>
It appears that some writers of English now use &#34;can not&#34; to mean &#34;cannot&#34;.
In speech the two cannot be distinguished, so it doesn&#39;t matter, but in written
mathematics we should avoid ambiguities.  The logical meaning of &#34;can not fail&#34;
is &#34;may possibly succeed&#34; while &#34;cannot fail&#34; means &#34;must succeed&#34;.  At the
very least, when &#34;can not&#34; is used to mean &#34;cannot&#34; it can be read to have a
different meaning, so it is better to use &#34;cannot&#34; to eliminate the ambiguity.
As in many of these items, the abstractness of mathematical statements in
contrast to the everyday context of English language begs a higher level of
precision and avoidance of ambiguity.

<p>
The expression &#34;may be&#34; does exist in English, when used as a verb as in &#34;It
may be true&#34; or &#34;This may be the only component&#34;.  However, when it appears at
the start of a clause most likely the word &#34;maybe&#34; is intended, as in &#34;Maybe
this proof will work.  In this situation there is another verb (&#34;work&#34;), and
the initial expression means &#34;Possibly&#34;, which is not a verb.

<i>&#34;Evidently&#34;.</i>
Some nonnative speakers write &#34;Evidently&#34; to mean &#34;Clearly&#34;.  Although this
word is not technically incorrect, it has other connotations to native
speakers.  Combining this with the fact that they would always write &#34;Clearly&#34;
and never &#34;Evidently&#34;, they are confused about what the writer means.
Always change &#34;Evidently&#34; to &#34;Clearly&#34;.  (&#34;Evidently&#34; is quite close to
&#34;apparently&#34;, which in American English means &#34;seems to be true&#34; rather than
