<p>TL;DR: I&#39;m considering replacing those various <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> compnents with...</p>

<ul>
<li>ebook viewer: <a href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader/">koreader</a> on e-readers, <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/atril">Atril</a> on the desktop,
testing <a href="https://sioyek.info/">sioyek</a> as a more powerful, keyboard-driven alternative</li>
<li>ebook editor: <a href="https://sigil-ebook.com/">Sigil</a></li>
<li>file converter: no good alternative</li>
<li>collection browser: <a href="https://git.autistici.org/ale/liber">Liber</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/trantor/trantor">trantor</a>? see also <a href="https://restofworld.org/services/bookmarks/">bookmarks</a></li>
<li>ebook web server: <a href="https://git.autistici.org/ale/liber">Liber</a>? <a href="https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web">calibre-web</a>?</li>
<li>metadata editor: no good alternative</li>
<li>device synchronisation: <a href="https://restofworld.org/hardware/tablet/kobo-clara-hd/#install-syncthing">Syncthing</a></li>
<li>RSS reader: <a href="https://feed2exec.rtfd.io/">feed2exec</a> then <a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/wallabako">wallabako</a> to <a href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader/">koreader</a></li>
</ul>


<p>My biggest blocker that don&#39;t really have good alternatives are:</p>

<ul>
<li>collection browser</li>
<li>metadata editor</li>
</ul>


<p>See below why and a deeper discussion on all the features.</p>



<p><a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> is an amazing software: it allows users to manage ebooks
on your desktop and a multitude of ebook readers. It&#39;s used by Linux
geeks as well as Windows power-users and vastly surpasses any native
app shipped by ebook manufacturers. I know almost exactly zero people
that have an ebook reader that do <em>not</em> use Calibre.</p>

<p>However, it has had many problems over the years:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Calibre is a <strong>complex</strong> piece of machinery, and it&#39;s therefore
<strong>buggy</strong>. It manages to simultaneously ship with <strong>embedded
libraries</strong> (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/872595">872595</a>, <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/704977">704977</a>, <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/684229">684229</a>, <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/555352">555352</a>,
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/555368">555368</a>, <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/700838">700838</a>, most fixed in Debian) and also suffer
from the <em>*NIH syndrome</em>. For example, it implement its own web
framework instead of reusing stuff like requests or flask.</p></li>
<li><p>There are <strong>numerous security issues in Calibre</strong>. For example, it can
execute arbitrary code while fetching news (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/873795">873795</a>) or
plugin updates (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/640026">640026</a>), it would phone home (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/584334">584334</a>, fixed in Debian), allowed arbitrary file access via
crafted files (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/853004">853004</a>, <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/608822">608822</a>), arbitrary
code execution in bookmark data (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/892242">892242</a>), and XSS vuln
(<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/608822">608822</a>), or even insecure embedded libraries
(<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/873660">873660</a>, <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/787085">787085</a>). Some of those issues have
been fixed upstream but, <a href="https://lists.debian.org/87muy0usv1.fsf@curie.anarc.at">in my experience</a>, it&#39;s clear that
<strong>upstream does not take security seriously</strong>. The best example is
probably the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/+bug/885027">legendary security bug about how Calibre handled
mounting partitions</a> which upstream refused to fix properly even
after a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/465311/">LWN article</a> came out about it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incomplete Python 3 support</strong>. because of this, Calibre 4.0 was
<a href="https://www.preining.info/blog/2019/10/rip-for-now-calibre-in-debian/">removed from Debian in 2019</a> (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/936270">936270</a>). Now a there
is <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre/blob/63f1996/README.python3">port in progress</a> which is going well: only the plugins and
the ebook-viewer are blocking progress right now. In the past, the
author infamously claimed it wasn&#39;t necessary to port to Python3
because he could <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=293242">maintain Python 2 himself</a>, but it seems he
backtracked on that position since then.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Update: a previous version of that post claimed that all of Calibre
had been removed from Debian. This was inaccurate, as the <a href="https://mastodon.social/@norbu/102918222761204651">Debian
Calibre maintainer pointed out</a>. What happened was <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1069411/accepted-calibre-400dfsg-1-source-into-unstable/">Calibre 4.0 was
uploaded to Debian unstable</a>, then <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=941802">broke</a> because of missing
Python 2 dependencies, and an <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1069605/accepted-calibre-400really348dfsg-1-source-into-unstable/">older version (3.48) was uploaded in
its place</a>. So Calibre <em>will</em> stay around in Debian for the
foreseeable future, hopefully, but the current latest version (4.0)
cannot get in because it depends on older Python 2 libraries.</p>

<p>The latest issue (Python 3) is the last straw, for me. While
Calibe is an awesome piece of software, I can&#39;t help but think it&#39;s
doing too much, and the wrong way. It&#39;s one of those tools that looks
amazing on the surface, but when you look underneath, it&#39;s a monster
that is impossible to maintain, a liability that is just bound to
cause more problems in the future.</p>



<p>So let&#39;s say I wanted to get rid of Calibre, what would that mean
exactly? What do I actually use Calibre for anyways?</p>

<p>Calibre is...</p>

<h2 id="ebook-viewer"><a name="index1h2"></a>ebook viewer</h2>

<p>Calibre ships with the <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/ebook-viewer">ebook-viewer</a> command, which allows one to
browse a vast variety of ebook formats. I <em>rarely use</em> this feature,
since I read my ebooks on a e-reader, on purpose. There is, besides, a
good variety of ebook-readers, on different platforms, that can
replace Calibre here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://naihe2010.github.io/apvlv/">apvlv</a>, poppler-based viewer, supports EPUBs, vi-like
keybindings</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.kde.org/arianna/">arianna</a>, KDE&#39;s epub.js implementation, similar to Foliate and
inspired by <a href="https://peruse.kde.org/">Peruse</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/atril">Atril</a>, MATE&#39;s version of <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince">Evince</a>, supports ePUBs (Evince
doesn&#39;t seem to), but fails to load certain ebooks (book #1459 for
example)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wustho/baca">baca</a> is a TUI interface that also looks interesting</li>
<li><a href="https://babluboy.github.io/bookworm/">Bookworm</a> looks very promising, not in Debian (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/883867">883867</a>), but
<a href="https://www.flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.babluboy.bookworm">Flathub</a>. scans books on exit, and can take a
loong time to scan an entire library (took 24+ hours here, and had
to kill <code>pdftohtml</code> a few times) without a progress bar. but has a
nice library browser, although it looks like covers are sorted
randomly. search works okay, however. unclear what happens when you
add a book, it doesn&#39;t end up in the chosen on-disk library.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oguzhaninan/Buka">Buka</a> is another &#34;ebook&#34; manager written in Javascript, but only
supports PDFs for now.</li>
<li><a href="http://list.xmodulo.com/cool-reader.html">coolreader</a> is another alternative, <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/715470">not yet in Debian
(#715470)</a></li>
<li>Emacs (of course) supports ebooks through <a href="https://github.com/wasamasa/nov.el">nov.el</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fbreader.org/">fbreader</a> also supports ePUBs, but is much slower than all those
others, and turned proprietary so is unmaintained</li>
<li><a href="https://johnfactotum.github.io/foliate/">Foliate</a> looks gorgeous and is built on top of the ePUB.js
library, not in Debian, but <a href="https://www.flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.johnfactotum.Foliate">Flathub</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Books">GNOME Books</a> is interesting, but relies on the GNOME search
engine and doesn&#39;t find my books (and instead lots of other
garbage). it&#39;s been described as &#34;basic&#34; and &#34;the least mature&#34; in
<a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/07/best-ebook-reader-app-ubuntu">this OMG Ubuntu review</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader/">koreader</a> is a good alternative reader for the Kobo devices and
now also has builds for Debian, but no Debian package</li>
<li><a href="http://lucidor.org/lucidor/">lucidor</a> is a Firefox extension that can read an organize books,
but is not packaged in Debian either (although upstream provides a
.deb). It depends on older Firefox releases (or &#34;<a href="https://www.palemoon.org/">Pale moon</a>&#34;, a
Firefox fork), see also the <a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/firefox/">firefox</a> XULocalypse for details</li>
<li><a href="https://mupdf.com/">MuPDF</a> also reads ePUBs and is really fast, but the user
interface is extremely minimal, and copy-paste doesn&#39;t work so well
(think &#34;Xpdf&#34;). it also failed to load certain books (e.g.  1359),
fails to render some tables (e.g. book 1608) and warns about 3.0
ePUBs (e.g. book 1162)</li>
<li><a href="https://okular.kde.org/">Okular</a> supports ePUBs when <code>okular-extra-backends</code> is installed</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/baskerville/plato/">plato</a> is another alternative reader for Kobo readers, not in
Debian</li>
<li><a href="https://sioyek.info/">sioyek</a> is a powerful, extensible and keyboard-driven PDF (and
ePUB!) viewer mostly aimed at academic paper review, but it has all
sorts of nice features like highlights, bookmarks, and more</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/xreader">xreader</a> GTK-only viewer based on Atril, <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=958981">not in Debian</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/">zathura</a> supports ePUBs with the <a href="https://mupdf.com/">MuPDF</a> <a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura-pdf-mupdf/">backend</a>, but that
backend is <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=731447">not in Debian</a></li>
</ul>


<p>See also the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/pdf-viewer">pdf-viewer metapackage</a> for other ideas here.</p>

<h2 id="ebook-editor"><a name="index2h2"></a>ebook editor</h2>

<p>Calibre also ships with an <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/ebook-edit">ebook-edit</a> command, which allows you to
do all sorts of nasty things to your ebooks. I have rarely used this
tool, having found it hard to use and not giving me the results I
needed, in my use case (which was to reformat ePUBs before
publication).</p>

<p>For this purpose, <a href="https://sigil-ebook.com/">Sigil</a> is a much better option, now packaged in
Debian.</p>

<p>There are also various tools that render to ePUB: I often use the
<a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx documentation system</a> for that purpose, and have been able
to produce ePUBs from LaTeX for some projects.</p>

<h2 id="file-converter"><a name="index3h2"></a>File converter</h2>

<p>Calibre can convert between many ebook formats, to accommodate the
various readers. In my experience, this doesn&#39;t work very well: the
layout is often broken and I have found it&#39;s much better to find
pristine copies of ePUB books than fight with the converter.</p>

<p>There are, however, no alternatives to Calibre for this functionality,
unfortunately.</p>

<h2 id="collection-browser"><a name="index4h2"></a>Collection browser</h2>

<p>This is the main functionality I would miss from Calibre. I am
constantly adding books to my library, and Calibre does have this
incredibly nice functionality of just hitting &#34;add book&#34; and Just Do
The Right Thing™ after that. Specifically, what I like is that it:</p>

<ul>
<li>sort, view, and search books in folders, per author, date, editor,
etc</li>
<li>quick search is especially powerful</li>
<li>allows downloading and editing metadata (like covers) easily</li>
<li>track read/unread status (although that&#39;s a custom field <em>I</em> had to
add)</li>
</ul>


<p>Calibre is, as far as I know, the only tool that goes so deep in
solving that problem. The <a href="https://git.autistici.org/ale/liber">Liber</a> web server, however, does provide
similar search and metadata functionality. It also supports migrating
from an existing Calibre database as it can read the Calibre metadata
stores. When no metadata is found, it fetches some from online sources
(currently Google Books).</p>

<p>One major limitation of Liber in this context is that it&#39;s solely
search-driven: it will not allow you to see (for example) the &#34;latest
books added&#34; or &#34;browse by author&#34;. It also doesn&#39;t support
&#34;uploading&#34; books although it will incrementally pick up new books
added by hand in the library. It somewhat assumes Calibre already
exists, in a way, to properly curate the library and is more designed
to be a search engine and book sharing system between liber
instances. This is something that <a href="https://gitlab.com/trantor/trantor">trantor</a> might be better at,
although it doesn&#39;t use the Calibre database, so it might not have as
good metadata...</p>

<p>This also connects with the more general &#34;book inventory&#34; problem I
have which involves an inventory physical books and directory of
online articles. See also <a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/firefox/">firefox</a> (Zotero section) and
<a href="https://restofworld.org/services/bookmarks/">bookmarks</a> for a longer discussion of that problem.</p>

<p>Finally, it could simply be that a file browser could act as a
collection browser, as long as book covers would be shown in parent
folders. KDE&#39;s <a href="https://apps.kde.org/dolphin/">Dolphin</a> actually shows a preview of images inside a
folder, but only one layer deep, so it actually doesn&#39;t really work
for Calibre-styled libraries, where each book has its own
directory. <a href="https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start">Thunar</a> (XFCE&#39;s) doesn&#39;t seem to do previews correctly
either.</p>

<p>And this of course overlaps with another functionality that Calibre
provide, which is that it&#39;s also... a web server!</p>

<h2 id="ebook-web-server"><a name="index5h2"></a>ebook web server</h2>

<p>Calibre can indeed also act as a web server, presenting your entire ebook
collection as a website. It also supports acting as an OPDS directory,
which is kind of neat. There are, as far as I know, no alternative for
such a system although there <em>are</em> servers to share and store ebooks,
like <a href="https://gitlab.com/trantor/trantor">Trantor</a> or <a href="https://git.autistici.org/ale/liber">Liber</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, neither of those support OPDS, which is too bad: that
protocol is quite useful to browse books on the fly from hacked Kobo
readers (running <a href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader/">Koreader</a>, but <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/plato/issues/69">not Plato</a>) or Android devices
(running <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.sufficientlysecure.viewer/">Document Viewer</a> or Koreader)... There is an OPDS <a href="http://feedbooks.github.io/opds-test-catalog/">test
server</a>, see also my <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/1253#issuecomment-204996640">2016 analysis</a>.</p>

<p>Other alternatives include a web interface called <a href="https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web">calibre-web</a>
that seems independent from the Calibre project and talks directly to
the database using SQLAlchemy. It does use calibre components to
convert books but it might be an interesting alternative to the web
interface shipped with Calibre.</p>

<p><a href="https://readarr.com/">readarr</a> (&#34;arr&#34; stands for &#34;aaargh C#/Windows!&#34;) and <a href="https://vaemendis.net/ubooquity/">Ubooquity</a>
(... Java) are things as well, neither of which are packaged in Debian.</p>

<h3 id="calibre-webserver-setup"><a name="index1h3"></a>calibre webserver setup</h3>

<p>I ended up setting up calibre on the server side of things to have an
OPDS directory to more easily transfer books from my e-reader, now
that I have an Android tablet (running &#34;Document Viewer&#34; or
&#34;Koreader&#34;, both of which support OPDS), or Koreader on my Kobo (which
works much better than before, thanks to NickelMenu. I setup the
service using this <code>.service</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>[Service]
Type=simple
User=calibre-sandbox
Group=media
# this exposes the service to local users, which isn&#39;t great. socket activation
# would be better, but is not documented upstream and, well, it&#39;s only books and
# /srv/books is readable anyways..
ExecStart=/usr/bin/calibre-server --disable-fallback-to-detected-interface --listen-on 127.0.0.1 --port 4341 /srv/books

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>

<p>The server is made publicly visible with authentication (because I
don&#39;t trust calibre&#39;s builtin auth) thanks to this Apache
configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName calibre.anarc.at
    Redirect / https://calibre.anarc.at/
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    ServerName calibre.anarc.at
    Use common-letsencrypt-ssl calibre.anarc.at
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/
    AllowEncodedSlashes On
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass /.well-known/ !
        # 43 41 is ASCII hex for C A (L I B R E)
        ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:4341/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:4341/

        &lt;Location /&gt;
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName &#34;Restricted Content&#34;
        AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/htpasswd.calibre
        Require valid-user
    &lt;/Location&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Calibre is installed <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.calibre_ebook.calibre">through Flatpak</a> because that version is more
up to date in Debian (although for the server side of things that
shouldn&#39;t really matter). I tried to make systemd detect changes to
the database and reload the service, but it failed, so maybe i&#39;ll need
to look at another <a href="https://restofworld.org/blog/2019-11-20-file-monitoring-tools/">filesystem monitoring tool</a>.</p>

<p>If you get a weird error about &#34;Failed to communicate&#34;, it might be
because the database is not writable by Calibre. Here I had to make it
owned by a shared group and writable:</p>

<pre><code>chown :media metadata*
chmod g+w metadata*
</code></pre>

<p>I also added that in <code>.git/hooks/post-checkout</code> for my future self,
although <code>git-annex</code> might overwrite that eventually...</p>



<p>The &#34;collection browser&#34; is based on a lot of metadata that Calibre
indexes from the books. It can magically find a lot of stuff in the
multitude of file formats it supports, something that is pretty
awesome and impressive.</p>

<p>For example, I just added a PDF file, and it found the book cover,
author, publication date, publisher, language and the original mobi
book id (!). It also added the book in the right directory and dumped
that metadata and the cover in a file next to the book. And if that&#39;s
not good enough, it can poll that data from various online sources
like Amazon, and Google books.</p>

<p>Maybe the <a href="https://seegras.discordia.ch/Blog/life-with-calibre/">work Peter Keel did</a> could be useful in creating some
tool which would do this automatically?</p>

<p>Keel&#39;s work relies on the aging <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ebook-tools/">epub-tools</a> suite which hasn&#39;t seen
a release since 2012, but does offer some sort of parsing of
ePUBs. For example, the <code>einfo</code> command can extract the author and
title of a book and could be used to reproduce the &#34;put file in the
right directory&#34; part of what Calibre is doing here.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/aerkalov/ebooklib">ebooklib</a> library is another piece of code that might be
usable to generate our own importer, as it can parse (and edit!)
metadata from books.</p>

<p><a href="https://git.autistici.org/ale/liber">Liber</a> can also fetch metadata from Google books, but not
interactively.</p>

<p>So I still use Calibre for importing books, but mostly rely on
Koreader to browse the library, basically using the folder hierarchy
with modification timestamps as a guide.</p>

<p>I rarely use Calibre to actually edit the metadata, although it does
happen when the author, title, or collection is really mangled. I do
miss a way to regroup books by collections sometimes, but can&#39;t help
but think this could be done by folder / book naming or some out of
band metadata.</p>

<h2 id="device-synchronization"><a name="index7h2"></a>Device synchronization</h2>

<p>I used Calibre to synchronize books with an ebook reader (typically a
Kobo). It can automatically update the database on the ebook with
relevant metadata (e.g. collection or &#34;shelves&#34;), although I did not
really use that feature. I did like to use Calibre to quickly search
and prune books from by ebook reader, however.</p>

<p>I considered using <a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/">git-annex</a> for this, however, given that I
already use it to synchronize and backup my ebook collection in the
first place...</p>

<p>But more recently I started just synchronising my entire book
collection with <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>. The collection is small enough to fit
on a SD card if I judiciously ignore some parts with a local
<code>.stignore</code> file. The details of that setup are in <a href="https://restofworld.org/hardware/tablet/kobo-clara-hd/#install-syncthing">this blog
post</a>.</p>



<p>I used this for a while to read RSS feeds on my ebook-reader, but it
was pretty clunky. Calibre would be continously generating new ebooks
based on those feeds and I would never read them, because I would
never find the time to transfer them to my ebook viewer in the first
place. Instead, I use a regular RSS feed reader.</p>

<p>I ended up writing my own (<a href="https://feed2exec.rtfd.io/">feed2exec</a>) and when I find an article I
like, I add it to <a href="https://wallabag.org/en">Wallabag</a> which gets sync&#39;d to my reader using
<a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/wallabako">wallabako</a>, another tool I wrote.</p>

<h2 id="other-functionality-and-future-thoughts"><a name="index9h2"></a>Other functionality and future thoughts</h2>

<p>Note that I might have forgotten functionality in Calibre in the above
list: I&#39;m only listing the things I have used or am using on a regular
basis. For example, you can have a USB stick with Calibre on it to
carry the actual software, along with the book library, around on
different computers, but I never used that feature.</p>

<p>So there you go. It&#39;s a colossal task! And while it&#39;s great that
Calibre does all those things, I can&#39;t help but think that it would be
better if Calibre was split up in multiple components, each maintained
separately. I would love to use <em>only</em> the document converter, for
example. It&#39;s possible to do that on the commandline, but it still
means I have the entire Calibre package installed.</p>

<p>Maybe a simple solution, from Debian&#39;s point of view, would be to
split the package into multiple components, with the GUI and web
servers packaged separately from the commandline converter. This way I
would be able to install only the parts of Calibre I need and have
limited exposure to other security issues. It would also make it
easier to run Calibre headless, in a virtual machine or remote server
for extra isoluation, for example.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Calibre&#39;s design doesn&#39;t lend well to this. Everything
is bundle up together and what seem to be independent binaries (say,
<code>ebook-meta</code>) are really stub entry points to the much larger Calibre
Python modules.</p>
