<p><strong>Update (afternoon of Aug. 7): </strong>Hours after this post was published, my Goodreads profile was cleaned of the offending titles. However, the garbage books remain available for sale at Amazon with my name attached.</p>



<p>I did file a report with Amazon, complaining that these books were using my name and reputation without my consent. Amazon’s response: “Please provide us with any trademark registration numbers that relate to your claim.” When I replied that I did not have a trademark for my name, they closed the case and said the books would not be removed from sale.</p>



<p><strong>Update (morning of Aug. 8): </strong>The fraudulent titles appear to be removed from Amazon. I’m sure that’s in so small part due to my visibility and reputation in the writing and publishing community. What will authors with smaller profiles do when this happens to them? If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, I’d start by reaching out to an advocacy organization like <a href="https://authorsguild.org/">The Authors Guild</a> (I’m a member).</p>



<hr/>



<p>There’s not much that makes me angry these days about writing and publishing. I’ve seen it all. I know what to expect from Amazon and Goodreads. Meaning: I don’t expect much, and I assume I will be continually disappointed. Nor do I have the power to change how they operate. My energy-saving strategy: move on and focus on what you can control.</p>



<p>That’s going to become much harder to do if Amazon and Goodreads don’t start defending against the absolute garbage now being spread across their sites.</p>



<p>I know my work gets pirated and frankly I don’t care. (I’m not saying other authors shouldn’t care, but that’s not a battle worth my time today.)</p>



<p><strong>But here’s what does rankle me: </strong>garbage books getting uploaded to Amazon where my name is credited as the author. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDCNNX39?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here’s but one example.</a>) Whoever’s doing this is obviously preying on writers who trust my name and think I’ve actually written these books. I have not. Most likely they’ve been generated by AI.</p>



<p>It might be possible to ignore this nonsense on some level since these books aren’t receiving customer reviews (so far), and mostly they sink to the bottom of search results (although not always). At the very least, if you look at my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Jane-Friedman/author/B004KHXQ0U?ref=ap_rdr&amp;store_ref=ap_rdr&amp;isDramIntegrated=true&amp;shoppingPortalEnabled=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">author profile on Amazon</a>, these junk books don’t appear. A reader who applies some critical thinking might think twice before accepting these books as mine.</p>



<p>Still, it’s not great. And it falls on me, the author—the one with a reputation at stake—to get these misleading books removed from Amazon. I’m not even sure it’s possible. I don’t own the copyright to these junk books. I don’t exactly “own” my name either—lots of other people who are also legit authors share my name, after all. So on what grounds can I successfully demand this stop, at least in Amazon’s eyes? I’m not sure.</p>



<p><strong>To add insult to injury, these sham books are getting added to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/625709.Jane_Friedman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my official Goodreads profile</a>. </strong>A reasonable person might think I control what books are shown on my Goodreads profile, or that I approve them, or at the very least I could have them easily removed. Not so.</p>



<p>If you need to have your Goodreads profile corrected—as far as the books credited to you—you have to reach out to volunteer “librarians” on Goodreads, which requires joining a group, then posting in a comment thread that you want illegitimate books removed from your profile.</p>



<p>When I complained about this on Twitter/X, an author responded that she had to report 29 illegitimate books in just the last week alone. 29!</p>



<p>With the flood of AI content now published at Amazon, sometimes attributed to authors in a misleading or fraudulent manner, how can anyone reasonably expect working authors to spend every week for the rest of their lives policing this? And if authors <em>don’t</em> police it, they will certainly hear about it, from readers concerned about these garbage books, and from readers who credulously bought this crap and have complaints. Or authors might not hear any thing at all, and lose a potential reader forever.</p>



<p>We desperately need guardrails on this landslide of misattribution and misinformation. Amazon and Goodreads, I beg you to create a way to verify authorship, or for authors to easily block fraudulent books credited to them. Do it now, do it quickly.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, even if and when you get these insane books removed from your official profiles, they will still be floating around out there, with your name, on two major sites that gets millions of visitors, just waiting to be “discovered.” And there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it.</p>
