    <h1>End-of-life smartphone? Penguins at PostmarketOS aim to revive it</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A Linux distro for smartphones abandoned by their manufacturers, postmarketOS, has introduced in-place upgrades.</p>
<p>Alpine Linux is a very minimal general-purpose distro that runs well on low-end kit, as <em>The Reg</em> FOSS desk <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/26/alpine_linux_316_released/">found when we looked at version 3.16 last month</a>. postmarketOS&#39;s – pmOS for short – <a href="https://postmarketos.org/blog/2022/06/12/v22.06-release/" rel="nofollow">version 22.06</a> is based on the same version.</p>
<p>This itself is distinctive. Most other third-party smartphone OSes, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/09/android_security_bulletin/">such as LineageOS or GrapheneOS</a>, or the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/02/13/oneplus_oxygenos_team/">former CyanogenMod</a>, are based on the core of Android itself.</p>

    

<p>The project is quite different. It uses the mainline Linux kernel, and a standard userland, to support a wide variety of devices. The theory is that not needing a manufacturer&#39;s outdated firmware or drivers means that pmOS can use more current components, direct from the various upstream Linux projects. The project&#39;s own <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">wiki</a> currently <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices" rel="nofollow">lists</a> over 200 supported devices, including phones, tablets, and e-book readers, ranging back to the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2009/12/07/review_phone_nokia_n900_smartphone/">venerable Nokia N900</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>They&#39;re not all equally supported, though. Most of them can can boot, many have Wi-Fi support, but currently just two actual phones work <em>as phones</em>: the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/08/pinephone_ships_developers/">open-source hardware PinePhone</a> and the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/09/21/gnome_foundation_backs_librem_5_privacy_smartphone/">Purism Librem 5</a>. Even saying that, though, the ability to connect to Wi-Fi and use an old device as a pocketable terminal could make obsolete hardware useful again.</p>
<p>As it resembles a normal desktop Linux, postmarketOS can run both X.org and Wayland, and a choice of user <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Category:Interface" rel="nofollow">interfaces</a>, including a plain text console or the Xfce desktop.</p>

        

<p>These might not be terribly useful on a touchscreen-based handheld device without a pointing device, so more importantly there are a choice of phone interfaces, including the GNOME-based <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Phosh" rel="nofollow">Phosh</a> and the KDE-based <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Plasma_Mobile" rel="nofollow">Plasma Mobile</a>, as well as the less-ambitious Simple X Mobile or <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Sxmo" rel="nofollow">Sxmo</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/07/ut_ota_21/">Lomiri smartphone UI</a>, formerly known as Ubuntu&#39;s Unity 8, is also <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Lomiri" rel="nofollow">represented</a> in an external branch of postmarketOS project.</p>

</ul>
<p>This isn&#39;t something you can put onto an old phone and give to your grandma just yet. It&#39;s still relatively early days, but it&#39;s a promising project. It reminds in some ways of the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/03/armbian_project_releases_version_2202/">Armbian project</a>, which aims to keep old single-board computers usable after their manufacturers stop updating them.</p>
<p>Mainstream Linux on phones has some way to go yet before it&#39;s as usable as it is on a desktop or laptop. (Stop heckling at the back there: it really is.) As is the open source way, there are various rival environments and applications, all working away trying to achieve the same ends – but because they&#39;re open source, they can help each other, sharing code and information and documentation.</p>
<p>Although it has a (very old) Linux kernel right at the bottom, Android itself isn&#39;t very Linux-like: everything above the kernel, from the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/master/libc" rel="nofollow">Bionic</a> C library and <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/toybox/+/master/toys/" rel="nofollow">Toybox</a> userland up to the Java-based app runtime, are very different.</p>

        

<p>Usually the hardware is quite capable, though. So long as you can unlock the bootloader and reflash it – and you know how to do that, or are willing to learn – it&#39;s great to see a viable alternative use for retired tablets.</p>
<p>THe British Computer Society previously bemoaned the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/27/product_release_cycles/">impact of product lifecycles on the environment</a>.
