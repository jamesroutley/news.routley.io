More than $5 trillion was borrowed and injected directly into the pockets of consumers and businesses. This unleashed a consumption binge of unprecedented proportions. Americans bought so much stuff, we literally clogged up both domestic and international supply chains.</p><p>But there’s a reason why stimulus often gets compared to taking drugs. It produces a temporary high, followed by a painful hangover.

Consider the following… </p><p>From 2019 to 2021, Tesla’s sales roughly doubled from around $50 billion to just under $100 billion. And over the same period, Tesla’s valuation ballooned from $50 billion to over $1 trillion. So, we’re talking about a car company trading at a 10x sales multiple. </p><p>Need I say more?</p><p>Of course, I fully appreciate that the bulls have plenty of elaborate narratives to justify why Tesla should trade like a world-class software monopoly with 80% profit margins and unlimited future growth prospects. But that was the whole point of the Peloton example - these are the stories that get invented to justify price action during manias. </p><p>In my mind, the only real factors that matter for Tesla’s share price are crowd psychology, price momentum and money flows. The bet here distills down to one question: does today’s mania have more room to run, or is it about to go bust? </p><p>Unfortunately for Tesla shareholders, all signs point towards bust in 2022. </p><h3>Peak Money Flows = Peak Mania </h3><p>Earlier I showed how trillions of fiscal stimulus dollars went into record U.S. goods consumption over the last 18 months, and how that’s a big problem when the mean reversion hits in the coming year. </p><p>But there was another key area where the fiscal stimulus funds poured into: financial markets.

Last year was a textbook example, as the market’s most speculative cash burning companies - including the recent string of low quality IPOs, SPACs and virtually every holding in the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) - flipped from market leaders in 2020 to market laggards in 2021: </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40196f5c-dbd0-4452-ac2b-f41e6276a75b_1069x676.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40196f5c-dbd0-4452-ac2b-f41e6276a75b_1069x676.png" width="728" height="676" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40196f5c-dbd0-4452-ac2b-f41e6276a75b_1069x676.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:676,&#34;width&#34;:1069,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><p>Jeremy Grantham describes this late cycle phenomenon as the “confidence termites” eating away at the outside of the bull market, before making their way into the foundation. For much of 2021, money moved away from these speculative stocks into the blue chip mega cap leaders - notably the FAANNG+ (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Nvidia, Alphabet, etc.) stocks. </p><p>But here’s the troubling sign for bulls - the confidence termites have now made their way to the former mega cap market generals, starting with Netflix. </p><p>After posting weak guidance for future subscription growth in its latest earnings report, Netflix dropped by more than 20% in a single day.

That reflected a 30x valuation multiple on what I believe could turn out to be peak earnings. So far, the bet has paid off… but there could still be a lot more room to run on the downside for Apple.  </p><p>Even after the recent market turbulence, the stock today trades for just over 26x trailing earnings. That might not seem like a crazy high valuation, but remember - that’s measured off of the earnings from a record consumption binge that could mean revert in a big way going forward. </p><p>The truth is, Apple is primarily a hardware company subject to both broader consumer spending patterns as well as the cyclicality around new iPhone product launches. If consumer spending takes a hit and/or buyers don’t believe the latest iPhone model offers enough new features to justify an upgrade, that’s a big problem for Apple. </p><p>Early indications suggest Apple could face lackluster demand for its new iPhone 13 . By some accounts, the new phone model offers a rather muted series of feature upgrades over the previous model. We might find out in 2022 that consumers are tapped out and not willing to spend $750 for the new base model iPhone 13.</p><p>Apple has already <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-tells-suppliers-demand-iphone-13-lineup-has-weakened-bloomberg-news-2021-12-02/" rel="">issued warnings regarding the outlook for the new iPhone 13</a> model, including a production downgrade of 10 million units due in part to softer than expected consumer demand. </p><p>So the question for Apple investors becomes: what if the company enjoyed a one-time pull forward in demand in 2021, which sets the stage for mean reversion in 2022? </p><p>What if the company’s net income drops to $75 billion in 2022, and investors decide they don’t want to pay more than 15x earnings - in line with the historical average. That’s a scenario where the share price could fall by more than 50% from current levels, and one which wouldn’t even require a very extreme set of circumstances.</p><p>Apple reports earnings later this week, and it will be a key stock I’m watching to see if we lose another key member of the narrow FAANNG leadership. In which case, it could be game over for this bull market. </p><p>Finally, looking beyond any single stock, the broader macro picture should give investors plenty of reason for a cautious stance going into 2022.  </p><p>The fiscal hangover will pressure consumption in the real economy, as well as reversing the record money flows that helped inflate the stratospheric valuations across today’s stock market. We’ve seen the first signs of boom turning to bust, and the Fed will soon be tightening monetary policy into a slowing economy. </p><p>That’s a recipe for lower earnings growth, a slowing economy, and lower valuations. </p><p>The takeaway: don’t expect 2022 to look anything like 2020 or 2021. </p><p>If you enjoyed this article and want to see more content, please like, share and subscribe below:  </p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
