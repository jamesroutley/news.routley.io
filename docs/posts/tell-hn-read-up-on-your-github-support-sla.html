    <h1>Tell HN: Read up on your GitHub Support SLA</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>A few weeks ago we experienced an outage for a few hours, we got 500&#39;s from both NPM and Nuget private GitHub feeds. This essentially halted progress in our CI pipeline, so trunk progress ceased for a few hours. Downtime happens. What&#39;s alarming is that as an enterprise customer ($250/user/year) we only got a response 11 days later containing, essentially, these things:<p>* &#34;Check again.&#34; If the turnaround on a support ticket is truly 11 days, we would have been facing a 22 day outage (as we&#39;d expect yet another 11 days after responding &#34;it&#39;s still happening&#34;).</p><p>* &#34;You have no SLA.&#34;</p><p>* &#34;If you want support, I can direct you to our sales team.&#34;</p><p>If, god forbid, Git access (or everything) had been down, we would have been scrambling to continue business, we wouldn&#39;t have had a number to call, and we likely would have had to pony up the cash.</p><p>I strongly recommend you take a good look you fall here: https://github.com/premium-support. Note that &#34;&lt; 8 hours&#34; under &#34;Enterprise&#34; mean absolutely nothing, as they aren&#39;t guaranteed (per your contract). A more honest value in the column would be &#34;N/A.&#34;</p><p>You have to get hold of sales to learn about premium support pricing, it isn&#39;t publicly disclosed. This is likely to prevent you from budgeting for premium support only in the event that you need it.</p><p>If your business continuity depends on GitHub Enterprise, and you don&#39;t have Premium support, you need to pay, plan, or change.</p></td></div></div>
