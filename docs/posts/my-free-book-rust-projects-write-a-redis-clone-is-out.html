I&#39;m interested in operating systems and computer languages, photography, fantasy and science fiction, video and board games, guitar playing, and (too) many other things.</p><p>I studied and used several programming languages, from the Z80 and x86 Assembly to Python and Scala. I love mathematics and cryptography. I&#39;m mainly interested in open source software, and I like both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science.</p><p>For 13 years I was a C/Python programmer and DevOps for a satellite imagery company. and I am currently infrastructure engineer at <a href="https://www.wegotpop.com" target="_blank">WeGotPOP</a>, a UK company based in London and New York that creates innovative software for film productions.</p><p>In 2013 I started publishing some technical thoughts on my blog, <a href="http://thedigitalcatonline.com" target="_blank">The Digital Cat</a>.
