    <h1>An AI Event Hired John Mulaney to Do a Comedy Set and He Brutally Roasted Them O</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>&#34;So many of you feel imminently replaceable.&#34;</h2><h2>Boom Roasted</h2><p>Standup comedian John Mulaney was invited to do a set at an AI event in San Francisco last week that organizer Salesforce billed as the &#34;largest AI event in the world,&#34; with roughly 45,000 people expected to be in attendance.</p><p>But little did they know Mulaney was about to eviscerate the company and the AI industry as a whole, delivering a lethal reality check to all those audience members at the Dreamforce event.</p><p>During his 45-minute set, Mulaney skewered the AI industry for its willingness to give up human agency, with <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tim-cook-admits-apple-ai-stop-lying">often fundamentally flawed</a> chatbots feeding users purported info about current events, work advice, and even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9955430/">medical diagnoses</a>.</p><p>&#34;If AI is truly smarter than us and tells us that [humans] should die, then I think we should die,&#34; a deadpan Mulaney told the crowd, as <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/09/19/comedian-john-mulaney-brutally-roasts-sf-techies-and-ai-at-dreamforce/">quoted by the <em>San Francisco Standard</em></a>. &#34;So many of you feel imminently replaceable.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Can AI sit there in a fleece vest?&#34; he added. &#34;Can AI not go to events and spend all day at a bar?&#34;</p><p>Mulaney also pointed out the fatal irony of hosting the event in a city that has faced a <a href="https://www.vox.com/a/homeless-san-francisco-tech-boom">devastating housing crisis</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/san-francisco-patches-over-homelessness-drug-abuse-apec-2023-11-15/">crime</a>, and <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/san-francisco-drug-overdose-deaths/">drug overdose deaths</a>.</p><p>&#34;Let me get this straight,&#34; he said. &#34;You’re hosting a ‘future of AI’ event in a city that has failed humanity so miserably?&#34;</p><h2>Irony Poisoning</h2><p>Mulaney also tapped into the industry&#39;s <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ceos-layoffs-ai-2024-davos">ongoing efforts to replace human workers</a> with AI, a heated debate that has gained considerable traction over the last couple of years.</p><p>Mulaney took the opportunity to roast attendees and their navel-gazing and self-congratulating.</p><p>&#34;Some of the vaguest language ever devised has been used here in the last three days,&#34; he said. &#34;The fact that there are 45,000 ‘trailblazers’ here couldn’t devalue the title anymore.&#34;</p><p>He also thanked the crowd for fundamentally changing the world for his almost three-year-old son, ensuring that he &#34;will never talk to an actual human again.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Instead, a little cartoon Einstein will pop up and give him a sort of good answer and probably refer him to another chatbot,&#34; Mulaney told audiences, referring to the fact that chatbots still have a <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-accuses-journalist-crimes">strong tendency to &#34;hallucinate&#34; facts</a>.</p><p>Mulaney even used an anecdote about himself and his son to send the message home.</p><p>&#34;We’re just two guys hitting Wiffle balls badly and yelling ‘Good job’ at each other,&#34; he said. &#34;It’s sort of the same energy here at Dreamforce.&#34;</p><p><strong>More on AI:</strong> <em><a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-datacenters-worse">AI Datacenters More Than 600 Percent Worse for Environment Than Tech Companies Claimed</a></em></p></div></div>
