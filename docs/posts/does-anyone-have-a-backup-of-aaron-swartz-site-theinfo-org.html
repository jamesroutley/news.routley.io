    <h1>Ask HN: Does anyone have a backup of Aaron Swartz&#39; site: theinfo.org?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi HN folks,<p>I was browsing Aaron&#39;s blog [<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve" rel="nofollow">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve</a>] when I noticed the footer links out to <a href="http://theinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://theinfo.org/</a> (last updated March 2008). However, none of the links are still alive, and I couldn&#39;t find any pages that were backed up on Archive.org.</p><p>I figured this would be the best place to ask - does anyone have an archive of these pages?</p></td></div></div>
