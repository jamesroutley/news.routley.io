    <h1>A common trap for people entering programming jobs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>A common trap for people entering programming jobs</h2>
<p>In my first programming job, I was given <em>The C Programming Language</em> and told to study it. So when I got my second programming job, I figured out what language I&#39;d be coding in and started studying up.</p>
<p>This was a mistake. Supposing you want to study for a job before you start the job, language study is almost always the wrong place to put your hours:</p>
<ol>
<li>If it&#39;s not a company-specific language, its range of use and ecosystem are probably so big that you can&#39;t know which parts of it will be used on the job.</li>
<li>And there will likely be specific libraries or tools that make using the language very different inside the company than outside of it.</li>
<li>There will often also be rules about which parts of the language you&#39;re allowed to use, and how. 
At my first BigCo job, I quickly realized that using C++ inside the company was more similar to using Java inside the company than it was to using C++ outside of the company.</li>
<li>With all respect: If you learn modern, beautiful, idiomatic use of some programming language, you&#39;re probably not going to see it on the job. 
It&#39;s good to know how the language is written under ideal conditions, but you&#39;ll still need to work with the code base you&#39;ve got.</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, there <em>is</em> a likely source of confusion you <em>can</em> often address in advance: tooling. Ask about what the team uses for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Version control;</li>
<li>Testing;</li>
<li>Deployment / continuous integration;</li>
<li>Databases; and</li>
<li>Log management and search.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes these will be proprietary, and sometimes they will not exist. 
But often they will (exist and) be things you can read about and even practice with. 
I have always found this sort of thing much harder to pick up than a new language.</p>
<p>If you have only ever worked on small- to medium-sized projects and are about to join a company, consider reading <em>Software Engineering at Google</em>. 
Whether or not you&#39;re going to work at huge scale, and whether or not you like all the recommendations in the book, it&#39;s a wonderful menu of the <em>problems</em> that arise from any kind of real scale. 
Any chapter of that book would have been more valuable to me than all the C++ prep I did back in the day.</p>
<p>P.S.: This post is about what to do <em>if</em> you want to study for a job before you start it. I&#39;m ignoring the question of whether such study is good, bad, appropriate, or whatever else.</p></div></div>
