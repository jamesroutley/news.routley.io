    <h1>Apple&#39;s union-busting practices violated employee rights at NYC store</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple is once again in trouble for its union-busting practices. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) judge ruled Apple interfered with employees&#39; organizing efforts at its World Trade Center store in New York City after workers, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-21/apple-illegally-interrogated-staff-about-union-judge-rules?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported</a>. Managers were found to have taken away pro-union flyers in the break room and attempted to dissuade employees from joining unions, which prosecutors argued had led employees to end the organizing campaign. A <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/02-CA-295979" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0">judge ordered Apple</a> &#34;cease and desist from coercively interrogating employees regarding their protected concerning activities and Union sympathies.&#34; </p>
<p>The news broke in early 2022 that <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-employee-union-plans-230050218.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0">Apple store workers nationwide were quietly organizing</a> in response to concerns that their wages didn&#39;t reflect the rising cost of living. However, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-union-starbucks-cwa-cumberland-012024025.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0">Apple soon hired the anti-union law firm Littler Mendelson</a>, which also represents Starbucks and McDonalds, among others. The company also instructed store managers to share anti-union sentiments, such as warning employees that joining a union could bring reduced pay, career opportunities and time off. That May, the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-world-trade-center-union-busting-complaint-060937009.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0">Communications Workers of America filed Unfair Labor Practice charges</a> for the Apple stores in the World Trade Center and Atlanta&#39;s Cumberland Mall. </p>
<p>Union efforts are slowly gaining ground at Apple stores across the country. The NLRB previously found Apple had violated federal law in Atlanta, including daily mandatory anti-union meetings for employees and interrogating workers. Last year, employees at an Apple store in <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/second-apple-store-to-unionize-oklahoma-city-070056192.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0">Maryland and another in Oklahoma voted to unionize</a>. Yet, other locations like the St. Louis branch abandoned plans to unionize, blaming similar tactics by Apple. </p></div></div>
