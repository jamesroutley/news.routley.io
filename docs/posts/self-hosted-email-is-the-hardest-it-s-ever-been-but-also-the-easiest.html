<p><strong>tl;dr - This post was inspired by <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/og-post">Carlos Fenollosa’s post</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32715437">and the resulting discussion on HN</a>). Self hosting email is the easiest it’s ever been – don’t let the email provider oligopoly (Gmail, Microsoft, Yahoo, etc) win.</strong></p>
<h2 id="discussion-up-until-now-deliverability-for-self-hsoted-emails-has-never-been-harder">Discussion up until now: Deliverability for self-hsoted emails has never been harder</h2>
<p>The top page on HN had an interesting post on it titled <a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/after-self-hosting-my-email-for-twenty-three-years-i-have-thrown-in-the-towel-the-oligopoly-has-won.html">“After self-hosting my email for twenty-three years I have thrown in the towel. The oligopoly has won.”</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Before you write off the post as just another self-hoster complaining, <a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/after-self-hosting-my-email-for-twenty-three-years-i-have-thrown-in-the-towel-the-oligopoly-has-won.html">read it</a>. Carlos has been at it a <em>LONG</em> time, and he’s tried everything</strong>. Carlos makes excellent points, and they’re all about the centralization of email services.</p>
<p>It’s true – <strong>Big, concentrated email services are elbowing out people who run their own servers in the name of “spam protection”</strong>. While the attacks may not be targeted to one individual or another, kafka-esque systems that often just <em>don’t work</em> are being employed to make it harder to land in user’s inbox.</p>
<p>Even if you you set up all the “acronyms” (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dkim">DKIM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC">DMARC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework">SPF</a>), emails from your self-hosted email server <em>may</em> go to spam.</p>
<h2 id="simultaneously-its-never-been-easier-to-self-host-your-email">Simultaneously: it’s never been easier to self-host your email</h2>
<p>One thing I didn’t want to get lost in the discussion is the fact that it’s <strong>also never been easier to start hosting your own email</strong>.</p>
<p>Deliverability may be troubled, but the act of running your own email server has never been easier. Struggling with <code>postfix</code> and <code>dovecot</code> configuration, semantics, and architecture isn’t the only way to start using email you control.</p>
<p><strong>There’s <em>awesome</em> softare out there that makes it possible these days to run your own email with very little effort.</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>You don’t have to <code>postfix</code> + <code>dovecot</code> in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t let the email oligopoly win. Keep hosting your own email.</strong></p>
<p>At the very least, use alternative email providers like <a href="https://proton.me">ProtonMail</a> (I personally use proton mail as well for a couple addresses, so I’m safe from myself breaking my mail setup :).</p>
<p>This page is probably going to serve as a reference I point to all the time <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=maddy%20hardwaresofton&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=comment">since I seem to talk about this far too much</a>.</p>
<h2 id="another-option-relaying-through-email-providers">Another option: Relaying through email providers</h2>
<p>An excellent recommendation from the original discussion on HN was to use <a href="https://improvmx.com">ImprovMX</a> as an outgoing email server. A quick list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://improvmx.com">ImprovMX</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mailgun.com">Mailgun</a> (Thanks <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32720573">9woc from HN</a> for the recommendation)</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of ImproveMX with a self-hosted server is also attractive and helps to at least somewhat mitigate the grip of the largest providers.</p>
<p>To replicate <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32720448">my response to this on HN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://improvmx.com/">https://improvmx.com/</a></p>
<p>Run your own email servers, but forward through there for better delivery?</p>
<p>Maybe this is what we need more of – A class of mail system participants who exclusively maintain trusted IPs and do the legwork of trying to get through the gnarly systems set up by the other large email providers.</p>
<p>I don’t know the solution but I know it needs to be discussed.</p>
