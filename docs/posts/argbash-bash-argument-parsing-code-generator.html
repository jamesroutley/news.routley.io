		<p>
		Who is the audience of Argbash?
		</p>
		<div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
		<p>
		Argbash can benefit anybody who writes Bash shell scripts. By taking over your script&#39;s command-line argument parsing, it boosts your script&#39;s user-friendliness at a negligible cost for you as the developer.

	<div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
		<p>
		How makes Argbash scripts to be user-friendly?
		</p>
		<div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
		<p>
		Typically, people hardcode paths and other parameters of the task they automate with the script, they rely on environment variables or they just accept positional arguments with no flexibility. Argbash makes it easy for your script to accept all kinds of command-line arguments in a flexible manner and you even get a comprehensive help message as a bonus. With Argbash, you can stop studying scripts just to find out how to call them!

		This was not possible before the Argbash project has not been introduced?
		</p>
		<div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
		<p>
		It was possible, but it was unclear how to approach this problem — see, for instance, the number of answers to the fundamental question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/192249/how-do-i-parse-command-line-arguments-in-bash">StackOverflow</a>, <a href="http://www.shelldorado.com/goodcoding/cmdargs.html">Shelldorado</a> or a renowned <a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/035">Bash best practices wiki</a>. Argbash&#39;s unique approach combines positives from the highest rated suggestions above.

	<div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
		<p>
		So how to parse command-line arguments in Bash in the best way?
		</p>
		<div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
		<p>
		Argbash is an excellent choice. The general consensus is that the best way of handling script argument means you have to write the parsing code all by yourself (check out the links in the previous answer). And Argbash does better than that, it generates that code, and it is a self-contained high-quality code. It takes the best from approaches mentioned in this <a href="http://argbash.readthedocs.io/en/stable/others.html">concise list of alternatives</a>. Moreover, the <a href="https://argbash.dev/generate">online generator</a> gets you on the track really quickly, so there is virtually no excuse for not giving Argbash a try.

		<p>
		Argbash online generator? This sounds good, but what if I am offilne?
		</p>
		<div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
		<p>
		Argbash is free and open-source software, the generator on the website is mainly for convenience. Installing Argbash locally is <a href="http://argbash.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html">very easy</a> and you are encouraged to do so. The online generator is just a frontend, you can achieve the same result at home without major obstacles. If you use it on a server where the Docker daemon is running, you can check out the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/matejak/argbash/">Argbash Docker image</a>

		<p>
		You can contact us if you are interested in packaging Argbash - we would like to make it easier for you. Another problem with Argbash is that it is a hidden gem — even the most awesome thing can&#39;t be useful to many if only few people know about it. Therefore, tell your friends, colleagues, CTO!
