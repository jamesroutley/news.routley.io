Today, we are thrilled to unveil a groundbreaking addition to our platform - the Interactive SQLite Documentation! Now, alongside our comprehensive documentation, users can directly interact with SQLite queries in real-time, empowering them to experiment, learn, and refine their SQL skills effortlessly.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Interactive SQLite Console?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine having a sandbox environment where you can test SQLite statements on-the-fly, without the need to set up your own database or worry about configurations. That&#39;s precisely what our Interactive SQLite Console offers! It&#39;s a powerful tool embedded within our official documentation (initially based on the SQLite documentation), allowing users to write and execute SQLite queries directly within their browser.</p>
<p><strong>How Does it Work?</strong></p>
<p>Under the hood, we leverage WebAssembly (WASM) technology to execute SQLite statements directly in the browser, providing a seamless and responsive experience. Additionally, we have preloaded a sample database, ensuring users have a rich dataset to work with from the moment they access the console.</p>
