<h3>Summary:</h3> 
<strong>Buy the book if you feel like it, learn from it, 
but use a library like the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">
GNU Scientific Library</a> instead.  Especially if you ever want
other people to use your work.  The NR license is the RIAA of the 
scientific community.

<tbody><tr><td>
Numerical Recipes in C/Fortran/Pascal/C++/ALGOL-68/whatever
is a very useful book for scientists who have to crunch numbers,
but can&#39;t spend a vast amount of time sorting through the
applied math literature.  In other words, practically everybody
in the non-wet sciences these days (and some of the wet scientists).
If you are, say, an astronomer reading this and thinking,
&#34;Hey, I never need to write programs or read Numerical Recipes,&#34;
it probably means you&#39;ve hired a postdoc or a grad student to
do it for you.

<tr><td>
There are applied math websites out there dedicated to pointing
out that NR does not always provide the best or most current
routines for a problem.  That&#39;s not my complaint - big whoop.
Its routines are generally quite adequate for use as tools, and the
book is very useful as pedagogy, i.e. even a dumb astronomer like me
can read it and learn without being a numerical analysis expert.
