    <h1>Ask HN: How to Stop Caring (Professionally)?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I get stressed out a lot by my work. The people, and the lack of autonomy.</p><p>It invades my evenings, my nights, I spend sometimes hours unable to sleep dreading the next day.</p><p>I don&#39;t have any autonomy. I&#39;m treated as a resource to be &#34;used&#34;. And I work with people I don&#39;t respect personally or professionally.</p><p>I have been looking for a way out for a while, but let&#39;s just say that quitting or finding another job is NOT an option for now, for the sake of argument - to hopefully get some actionable advice.</p><p>I already stopped caring about my work. But my personality finds it difficult to ignore things that are wrong. Sometimes I look at other colleagues communication with others and it affects me also, I see so much wrong but I can&#39;t do anything about it.</p><p>How can I just stop caring?</p></div></div></div>
