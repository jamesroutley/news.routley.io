Carlsen, who entered the tournament as the defending champion, broke his silence minutes after being disqualified and said that he was &#39;tired&#39; of FIDE. &#34;I am pretty tired of FIDE, so I want no more of this. I don’t want anything to do with them. I am sorry to everyone at home, maybe it’s a stupid principle, but I don’t think it’s any fun,&#34; Carlsen told NRK broadcasting company.</p><p>The World Rapid and Blitz Championship is taking place in New York. &#34;I said I will change tomorrow but they said you have to change now &amp; it became a matter of principle for me so here we are! Honestly, I’m too old at this point to care too much. If this is what they want to do I” ll probably set off to somewhere where the weather is a bit nicer,&#34; the <span>chess</span> legend told Take Take Take.</p><p><strong>FIDE issues statement</strong></p><p>&#34;FIDE regulations for the World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships, including the dress code, are designed to ensure professionalism and fairness for all participants,&#34; FIDE said in its statement.</p><p>&#34;Today, Mr. Magnus Carlsen breached the dress code by wearing jeans, which are explicitly prohibited under long-standing regulations for this event. The Chief Arbiter informed Mr. Carlsen of the breach, issued a $200 fine, and requested that he change his attire. Unfortunately, Mr. Carlsen declined, and as a result, he was not paired for round nine. This decision was made impartially and applies equally to all players.</p><p>Earlier in the day, another participant, Mr. Ian Nepomniachtchi, was also fined for breaching the dress code by wearing sports shoes. However, Mr. Nepomniachtchi complied, changed into approved attire, and continued to play in the tournament,&#34; the statement added.</p><p>Get <a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/latest-news">Latest News</a> Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from <a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/sports">Sports</a> and around the world.</p></div></div>
