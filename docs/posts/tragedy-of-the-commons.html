    <h1>Tragedy Of The Commons</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content">
<p>
There is one analogy that relates to my experience of software development that I like, and I like to bring up, again and again:
the dishwasher in a shared space.
A space like the kitchen at work.
Any shared space, any dishwasher, it’s always a mess.
You say, “it doesn’t really matter”, I say “it is so simple to keep tidy”.
I liken it to software development.
Even when we start with the best of intentions and great code, it gets messed up, quickly.
Like the first person putting their stuff on the rack, and those who follow, at some point it becomes a wreck.
A sort of <strong>tragedy of the commons</strong><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a>.</p>
<p>
So why is this such a good analogy and how is it illuminating?
Most of us work with smart people, yet we seemingly can not manage the simplest of shared activity, keeping the dishwasher functional.
Why is that?
We clearly have the brain power to tell a bad arrangement from a good one; Do we not?
We <em>can</em> see, that filled to the brink, it does not perform well; Can we not?
Is it because we don’t notice?
Is it because… it’s not a priority (we don’t care about that particular thing, at the last minute, heading out the office to catch a bus, or we’re distracted by some other thing)?
Is it because we’re not the ones doing the clean up (not my problem)?
We don’t see the consequences so we don’t identify the cause.
Is it because <em>you</em> think <em>I</em> don’t care, because <em>I</em> think <em>you</em> don’t care, because we might not notice each others good will?</p>
<p>
It might be some of those, it might be all of those, either way <strong>software development is the same</strong>.
We tend to think that software is complex<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>, and that that’s why quality deteriorates quickly, but to me it looks like it is actually something else.
An emergent phenomenon, be it a simple or complex task, as long as it is a shared activity.
Technical qualifications, it seems, are not the only thing that count.</p>
<p>
I’ve observed and experienced more diffusion of responsibility in teams, than I’ve seen distribution of responsibility.
That is how it seems to work.
It is not necessarily conscious, though the effort to fix it <em>is</em>.
Team-work can be hard, even a committed two-person team (as soon as it’s more than one person), to get it all right all the time.
You have a split brain.
You forget to communicate this or that.
You make assumptions your peers can not make.
You have priors your peers can not possibly have.
It is mutual.
Normally there is more than two of you.
Things start to go a little wrong.
You notice.
You take corrective action.</p>
<p>
To what extent?
Enough to fix that one instance or for all time?
Should you have done it sooner or later?
It should be the latter; It is probably the former.
You see, that is because we must identify these issues largely alone, but fix them as a team. 
Systematically crossing these boundaries, from a single instance, to dealing with it, is a difficult transition to make.</p>
<p>
I think the analogy not only helps understand the state of software but can also help fix it.
How far can we take it and how deeply analogous are any fixes?
I had a colleague who explained that quality was a matter of process:
quality in an artifact is because of quality in the process <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a>.</p>
