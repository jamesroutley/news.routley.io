<p>As a programmer, I feel a social pressure to leverage my skills and interest to do a certain kind of work. Extended family might ask about working for <a href="https://austin.towers.net/block-185-austins-new-google-tower-officially-topped-out-downtown/">household names</a>. Parts of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">the internet treat you as a corporate drone</a> if you aren’t on a tour of unicorn-or-bust startups making promises that they will change the world.</p>

<p>Feel free to ignore them.</p>


<p>There’s a whole <a href="https://dvclub.org/">network</a> of people with jobs like “Write a program which converts abstract program descriptions into real code which is as unrealistic, ineffecient, and overall <a href="http://impracticalprogrammer.com/2021/06/17/test-like-hardware.html">weird</a> as possible”. These people might work for <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110617005376/en/ARM-Acquires-Obsidian-Software-Bringing-Flexible-Verification-Solutions-to-Future-ARM-Processor-Designs">companies you’ve never heard of</a> and sell to customers you’ve never heard of. Nevertheless, these abstract, unheralded engineers are an important part of the chain of effort <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">underlying</a> all the positive and negative results of our complex technological world. The work you do can be valuable, even if the final results aren’t visible for several more steps.</p>


<p>Most people don’t build their identity around their employer in the way that seems common for programmers. To some extent, it makes sense for programmers to give it more thought- <a href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/apl-array-programming/www.levels.fyi">companies do seem to vary more in software</a> than elsewhere, across <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/benefits/">lots of dimensions</a>. But if the only thing your job gives you is <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/software-engineering/">excellent working conditions, high pay, and good job security</a> then the rewards for your work are already among the highest in the world. Even if the direct effect of your work is only that company A makes an extra sale instead of company B, if the indirect effect is that you can afford to <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23618/w23618.pdf">send a child to college</a> or donate <a href="https://www.givewell.org/cost-to-save-a-life">$5,000 to save a life</a>, you’ve had an enormous positive impact on the world.</p>


<p>A poet may write only to express themselves, sharing the result with no one but enriching their own experience. Give yourself permission to program for only the joy of the craft, the struggle over the problem, and the curiosity for the system. Whether you’re writing code for pay or exploring <a href="https://blog.jfo.click/fizzbuzz-is-a-jazz-standard/">fizzbuzz variants over a glass of wine</a>, if programming gives you joy, that’s enough.</p>
