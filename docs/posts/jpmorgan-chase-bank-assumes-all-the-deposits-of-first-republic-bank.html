                        <h2>For Release</h2>

						<p>WASHINGTON — First Republic Bank, San Francisco, California, was closed today by the  California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver.  To protect depositors, the FDIC is entering into  a purchase and assumption agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National  Association, Columbus, Ohio, to assume all of the deposits and substantially  all of the assets of First Republic Bank.</p>
						<p>JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association  submitted a bid for all of First Republic Bank’s deposits.  As part of the transaction, First Republic  Bank’s 84 offices in eight states will reopen as branches of JPMorgan Chase  Bank, National Association, today during normal business hours.  All depositors of First Republic Bank will  become depositors of JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, and will have  full access to all of their deposits. </p>
						<p>Deposits  will continue to be insured by the FDIC, and customers do not need to change  their banking relationship in order to retain their deposit insurance coverage  up to applicable limits.  Customers of First  Republic Bank should continue to use their existing branch until they receive  notice from JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, that it has completed  systems changes to allow other JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, branches  to process their accounts as well.</p>
						
						<p>As  of April 13, 2023, First Republic Bank had approximately $229.1 billion in  total assets and $103.9 billion in total deposits.  In addition to assuming all of the deposits, JPMorgan  Chase Bank, National Association, agreed to purchase substantially all of First  Republic Bank’s assets.</p>
						<p>The  FDIC and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, are also entering into a <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/lossshare/">loss-share  transaction</a> on single family, residential and commercial loans it purchased of the former  First Republic Bank.  The FDIC as  receiver and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, will share in the  losses and potential recoveries on the loans covered by the loss–share  agreement.  The loss–share transaction is  projected to maximize recoveries on the assets by keeping them in the private  sector.  The transaction is also expected  to minimize disruptions for loan customers.   In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, will assume all  Qualified Financial Contracts. </p>

						<p>The  resolution of First Republic Bank involved a highly competitive bidding process  and resulted in a transaction consistent with the least-cost requirements of  the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.  </p>
						<p>The  FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be about $13 billion.  This is an estimate and the final cost will be determined when the FDIC  terminates the receivership.</p>
