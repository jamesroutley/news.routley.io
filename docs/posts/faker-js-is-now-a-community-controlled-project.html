Mock data. Data for testing, development, and the like.</p><p><strong>Faker was first implemented in Perl in 2004 by Jason Kohles</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/faker-js/faker/discussions/55" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he reached out to us in support ðŸ’›</a>), and has since been ported to <em>many</em> languages including <a href="https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Java</a>, <a href="https://github.com/paraseba/faker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clojure</a>, and <a href="https://fakerphp.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHP</a>.</p><p>This is the JavaScript port.</p><h2 id="is-it-called-faker-or-faker-js" tabindex="-1">Is it called Faker or faker.js? <a href="#is-it-called-faker-or-faker-js" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>We try to call it Faker in the code and in titles, but faker-js is more available as a username.</p><h2 id="is-this-the-official-library" tabindex="-1">Is this the official library? <a href="#is-this-the-official-library" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>We&#39;re referring to it as the official library in the immediate term in order to disambiguate between the many rewrites and forks that are not community-maintained. We&#39;ve <a href="https://twitter.com/faker_js/status/1481918305669627905/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">merged all active forks to date</a>.

What&#39;s the TLDR? <a href="#i-heard-something-happened-what-s-the-tldr" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The Faker project was maintained by Marak Squires, an early-days impactful Node enthusiast and professional who <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-corrupts-npm-libs-colors-and-faker-breaking-thousands-of-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went rogue and acted maliciously</a> on January 4th, 2022. The package was deleted, and the project was abandoned.</p><p>We&#39;re now turning Faker into a <em>community-controlled project</em> currently maintained by <em>eight</em> engineers from various backgrounds and companies.</p><h2 id="funding-yml" tabindex="-1">FUNDING.yml <a href="#funding-yml" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>When we opened the repository, we received an influx of issues to remove Marak from the <code>FUNDING.yml</code>. <a href="https://github.com/faker-js/faker/pull/15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#15</a>, <a href="https://github.com/faker-js/faker/pull/43" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#43</a>, <a href="https://github.com/faker-js/faker/pull/110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#110</a>, <a href="https://github.com/faker-js/faker/pull/111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#111</a>, <a href="https://github.com/faker-js/faker/pull/112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#112</a></p><p>We were closing issues every other hour. Discussing the <code>FUNDING.yml</code> was inevitable. We pushed it off for four days so that we could focus on re-establishing the health of the project in service of the community.</p><p>When we became aware that this project was the most stable fork of Faker with the most community support, we realized that we needed to deal with the <code>FUNDING.yml</code> file and take a stance.</p><div><p>Short version, please</p><p>Jess posted a <a href="https://github.com/faker-js/faker/discussions/56#discussioncomment-1958057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concise and thorough writeup</a> of the logic behind our actions and decisions.</p><p>This was backed by the support of all of the co-maintainers. It&#39;s a much less narrative version of this section, so if you want the TLDR and some photos of the transactions, give it a read.</p></div><p>We came to the determination that users unfamiliar with the whole Faker situation wouldn&#39;t know that the repository&#39;s sponsorship links aren&#39;t funding the continued development of the project.</p><p>Fakerâ€™s financial support is held on behalf of the project by <a href="https://www.oscollective.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.oscollective.org/</a> and managed on <a href="https://opencollective.com/fakerjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://opencollective.com/fakerjs</a>, and so on January 12th, 2022, we contactedÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/BenJam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/BenJam</a>, the Executive Director at Open Source Collectiveâ€¦</p><p>During the conversation with Ben, he went over the terms and conditions of the Open Collective with me.</p><p>Ben said that simply, &#34;The funding is attached to the project, not the current maintainer.&#34;</p><p>Unanimously, we agreed that we <strong>wanted absolutely no ability to touch the existing funding</strong> and created a cut-over plan with the support of Open Collective.</p><div><p>Legacy collective</p><p>There is now a <a href="https://opencollective.com/fakerjs-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fakerjs-legacy</a> collective. Open Collective transferred all funds into the legacy account and invited Marak and the other maintainer, Brian, into the <em>legacy</em> collective so that they could do whatever they wanted with the funds.</p></div><p>After the funds were moved we were invited to become admins of the Faker collective. This meant that <em>we retained the existing sponsors</em> of the <a href="https://opencollective.com/fakerjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faker</a> collective who were paying for the continued maintenance of the project.</p><p>We believed that this was the most equitable and transparent way to act. The project&#39;s sponsors were able to continue to support the project and its ongoing development. Marak and Brian were able to retain the $11,652.69 USD previously donated to the project.</p><p>Since Open Collective champions transparency in funding, you can visit the fakerjs-legacy collective&#39;s <a href="https://opencollective.com/fakerjs-legacy/transactions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transactions</a> to see the deposits and any other transactions that have been made.</p><div><p>SPONSORING MARAK</p><p>For those who were sponsoring the fakerjs open collective as a way to personally sponsor Marak, please donate to the <a href="https://opencollective.com/fakerjs-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fakerjs-legacy open collective</a> OR <a href="http://opencollective.com/marak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marak&#39;s other open collective</a>. We don&#39;t know which is his preferred one. We will update this notice and post a new link if we hear otherwise from Marak.</p><p>An e-mail from our team will also arrive in the next few days notifying Open Collective sponsors that the maintainer team has changed.</p><p>We have no information with regards to his GitHub Sponsors.</p></div><h2 id="how-will-the-team-operate-financially" tabindex="-1">How will the team operate financially? <a href="#how-will-the-team-operate-financially" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>We reached out to Ben Nickolls, the Executive Director of Open Collective to get advice.</p><p>He had two recommendations:</p><ol><li>To do what ESLint is doing. &#34;<a href="https://eslint.org/blog/2020/10/year-paying-contributors-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A year of paying contributors: Review</a>&#34;</li><li>To attend the &#34;<a href="https://opencollective.com/workshops/events/deciding-on-how-to-use-your-money-020765bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deciding on how to use your money</a>&#34; workshop and apply what we learn there.</li></ol><p><strong>Those are the models we will follow</strong>.</p><h2 id="in-closing" tabindex="-1">In closing... <a href="#in-closing" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>We&#39;re excited to give new life to this idea and project.</p><p>This project <strong>can</strong> have a fresh start and it will become <em>even cooler</em>.</p><p>We felt we needed to do a public announcement because of all of the attention the project received in the media and from the community.</p><p>We believe that we have acted in the way that is best for the community.</p><p>We will continue to work on the project and not only maintain it, but actively develop new and awesome features.</p><p><em>- Jessica Sachs and the Faker Team</em></p></div></div></div>
