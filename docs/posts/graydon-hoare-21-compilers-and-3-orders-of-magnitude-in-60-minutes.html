    <h1>Graydon Hoare: 21 compilers and 3 orders of magnitude in 60 minutes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In 2019, Graydon Hoare gave <a href="http://venge.net/graydon/talks/CompilerTalk-2019.pdf?utm_source=thenewstack&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=platform">a talk to undergraduates (PDF of slides)</a> trying to communicate a sense of what compilers looked like from the perspective of people who did it for a living.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been aware of this talk for over a year and meant to submit a story here, but was overcome by the sheer number of excellent observations. I&#39;ll just summarise the groups he uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>The giants: by which he means the big compilers that are built the old-fashioned way that throw massive resources at attaining efficiency
</li><li>The variants, which use tricks to avoid being so massive:
<ol>
<li>Fewer optimisations: be traditional, but be selective and only the optimisations that really pay off
</li><li>Use compiler-friendly languages, by which he is really taking about languages that are good for implementing compilers, like Lisp and ML
</li><li>Theory-driven meta-languages, esp. how something like yacc allows a traditional Dragon-book style compiler to be written more easily
</li><li>Base compiler on a carefully designed IR that is either easy to compile or reasonable to bytecode-interpret
</li><li>Exercise discretion  to have the object code be a mix of compiled and interpreted
</li><li>Use sophisticated partial evaluation
</li><li>Forget tradition and implement everything directly by hand
</li></ol>
</li></ul>
<p>I really recommend spending time working through these slides. While much of the material I was familiar with, enough was new, and I really appreciated the well-made points, shout-outs to projects that deserve more visibility, such as Nanopass compilers and CakeML, and the presentation of the Futamura projections, a famously tricky concept, at the undergraduate level.</p> </div></div>
