  <p>Discussed guiding questions for Knitting as Program Execution project. Added summary excerpts.</p>
<h2>Today&#39;s Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>Try adding excerpts to log entries: a short summary paragraph at the beginning of the page</li>
</ul>
<h2>Knitting as Program Execution</h2>
<p>One of the projects I was hoping would strike inspiration during my <a href="https://recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> batch is an exploration of knitting. The link between writing a knitting pattern and programming is something I&#39;ve been daydreaming about for a long time. It&#39;s part of what inspired me to make my <a href="http://craftinatorics.com/">website about the intersection of math and craft</a>. Here are some guiding questions.</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Can we think of knitting patterns as programs and knitters as interpreters? How simple would a programmatic knitting interpreter be able to be to work? Can standard modern patterns be read by a computer unambiguously?</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>How do you represent a knit object&#39;s structure in code? (A graph? What&#39;s a node, and what&#39;s an edge?) If it&#39;s represented as a graph, are there existing rendering algorithms that could do edge-springiness to vaguely represent the shape of the finished knit product? I have a copy of the amicable <cite>Introduction to Graph Theory</cite> by Richard J. Trudeau, so I might get to get into that a bit more.</p>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>How do you describe the anatomy of a knitting pattern to non-knitters to show how similar it is to a program? (Functions, loops, arrays, etc.) How do you describe to knitters how they already know how a program works if they can follow a knitting pattern? (I&#39;m sure the overlap of these two groups knows exactly what I&#39;m talking about by all this, right?!)</p>
<h2>Excerpts</h2>
<p>I have added short summaries of the topics discussed in each log entry using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-frontmatter-customize/#example-parse-excerpts-from-content">Eleventy excerpts</a> and the help of <a href="https://webbureaucrat.gitlab.io/articles/eleventy-excerpts/">How to use Excerpts in Eleventy</a> to make sense of how to actually use them. It looks like this in my log files:</p>
<pre><code>---
frontmatter here
---

This is my little summary.

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

## Today&#39;s Plan
- blah blah blah
</code></pre>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve populated the log index with these summaries under each link. This spreads out the list of links nicely, keeping it easy to read and click/tap on. It is really cool to see an overview of what I&#39;ve worked on each day from the index, too.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to supply these summaries to my Atom feed, so that I can control the preview people see. My log entry titles are a little cryptic, because they are just the date. I&#39;d like the tagline to be more informative, at least.</p>
<h3>Wishes</h3>
<p>I wish this summary could be italicized in the log entries, to keep it distinct-looking. You can&#39;t really add a special tag to it for formatting automatically, I don&#39;t think? My options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t use the spcial custom frontmatter option, and instead put the summary in the YAML, then inject it into the page using the layout file.</li>
<li>Select the first paragraph of every entry page and style that with italics, hoping it&#39;s always the summary.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also think it would be really cool to auto-generate these from the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>&#39;s I&#39;ve used. But I might prefer hand-written, anyways to control the message a bit more.</p>
<h2>Task Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make a project page for my knitting ideas (paste today&#39;s writing into it)</li>
<li>Consider wrapping the <a href="https://quintenkonyn.recurse.com/about/">about</a> page in an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag?</li>
<li>Add the new line of CSS to the CSS breakdown</li>
<li>Add excerpts to Atom feed</li>
</ul>
