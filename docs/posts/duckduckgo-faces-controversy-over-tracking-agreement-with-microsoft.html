    <h1>DuckDuckGo faces controversy over tracking agreement with Microsoft</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>When it comes to browsing the web, it’s pretty much a given that everything you do is being tracked.</p>
<p>Which is why DuckDuckGo has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2014/03/21/duckduckgo-the-anti-google-that-doesnt-quack-sorry-track-you-when-searching-4668839/">won a legion of fans for its privacy-focused browsing experience.</a></p>
<p>The company offers iOS and Android browsers that don’t track your searches for ad targeting.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s currently experiencing some backlash because of a deal with tech giant Microsoft that impacts how these browsers behave on certain websites.</p>
<p>Privacy researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/thezedwards">Zach Edwards</a> posted an in-depth Twitter thread revealing that some trackers are being used on Microsoft-owned domains like Bing.com and LinkedIn.com.</p>
<p>The discrepency seems to come from an agreement between DuckDuckGo and Microsoft over syndicated search content from the latter to the former.</p>
<p>That agreement means that while DuckDuckGo doesn’t build a profile of its users through their search queries, it does incorporate contextual adverts from Microsoft’s advertising division.</p>
<p>While DuckDuckGo does still block plenty of third-party trackers from Microsoft and other tech giants – like Google and Facebook – it appears that not everything can be stopped from slipping through the cracks. Especially where corporate deals are concerned.</p>
<p>And while this doesn’t alter the fact that all search results on DuckDuckGo remain anonymous, it caused plenty of discussion on social media.</p>
<p>‘I tested the DuckDuckGo so-called private browser for both iOS and Android, yet *neither version* blocked data transfers to Microsoft’s Linkedin + Bing ads while viewing Facebook’s workplace[.]com homepage,’ he wrote in the Twitter thread detailing his find.</p>

</blockquote>
</div></figure><p>The finding has led to concern among fans of DuckDuckGo who want a <em>totally</em> private browsing experience.</p>
<p>Unfortuantely, the company’s boss, Gabriel Weinberg, has stepped in to explain why that can’t happen and defend its position.</p>
<p>‘We have always been extremely careful to never promise anonymity when browsing, because that frankly isn’t possible given how quickly trackers change how they work to evade protections and the tools we currently offer,’ Weinberg said in a statement provided to Metro.co.uk. </p>
<p>‘When most other browsers on the market talk about tracking protection they are usually referring to 3rd-party cookie protection and fingerprinting protection, and our browsers for iOS, Android, and our new Mac beta, impose these restrictions on third-party tracking scripts, including those from Microsoft. </p>
<p>‘What we’re talking about here is an above-and-beyond protection that most browsers don’t even attempt to do — that is, blocking third-party tracking scripts before they load on 3rd party websites.’ </p>
<p>He continued: ‘Because we’re doing this where we can, users are still getting significantly more privacy protection with DuckDuckGo than they would using Safari, Firefox and other browsers.</p>
<p>‘I know our product is not perfect and will never be. Nothing can provide 100% protection. And we face many constraints: platform constraints (we can’t offer all protections on every platform do to limited APIs or other restrictions), limited contractual constraints (like in this case), breakage constraints (blocking some things totally breaks web experiences), and of course the evolving tracking arms race that we constantly work to keep ahead of. </p>
<p>‘That’s why we have always been extremely careful to never promise anonymity when browsing outside our search engine, because that frankly isn’t possible. Holistically though I believe what we offer is the best thing out there for mainstream users who want simple privacy protection without breaking things, and that is our product vision.’</p>
