            As an epic fantasy painter, Boris Vallejo had a great influence on 1980s and 90s fantasy book covers,
            computer game box art, and the
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demoscene</a>. Through
            the decades, his works have been replicated by pixel artists. This article features fantasy art history,
            demoscene drama, and a lot of pixel art fun creating a Boris Vallejo imitation graphic using only four
            colors.

          <p>
            Recently, I was going through the historical results of the
            <a href="https://www.demoparty.net/revision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revision</a> demoparty, as you
            do. I was looking for a subject to draw for a new pixel art piece. I had learned to appreciate the color
            limitations during the old-school graphics competition at
            <a href="https://www.demoparty.net/evoke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evoke</a>, where we could only
            use a predefined color palette. The first time I submitted an entry in 2022, I hated it. The second time,
            in 2023, I came to accept the limited color palette as a problem to solve. And by 2024, I actually started
            to enjoy the challenge.
          </p>
          <p>I wanted to create a new piece outside of competition and was looking for inspiration.</p>
          <p>
            In the
            <a href="https://2013.revision-party.net/history/2013.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results.txt</a>
            file of Revision 2013, I found an interesting phrase. Right above the list of results for the graphics
            competition, it said:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              &#34;GRAPHICS COMPETITIONS HAVEN&#39;T BEEN</em>

          <h2 id="vallejo-01">Whatever Happened to Boris Vallejo?</h2>
          <p>
            I hadn&#39;t thought of Peruvian artist
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Vallejo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boris Vallejo</a>
            in ages. I remembered his slick fantasy artwork, featuring idealistically rendered warriors and
            princesses, muscular and scantily clad (but not indecent). If they weren&#39;t battling monsters, the figures
            wouldn&#39;t look out of place in a romance novel. Vallejo&#39;s paintings were always beautifully done, but
            they&#39;re a bit out of fashion these days.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/dragon-riders.jpg" alt="A group of scantily clad young women on the backs of dragons flying in the sky"/></p>
          <p>
            Pixel artists copied his work in the late 1980s and 1990s. Vallejo&#39;s visual aesthetic was one that many
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demoscene</a> groups
            sought to replicate or pay homage to on the new 16-bit platforms like the Commodore Amiga, the Atari ST,
            and the PC with its wonderful VGA graphics.
          </p>

            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/john-carter.jpg" alt="John Carter and the Princess of Mars confronting a four-armed giant white ape"/></p>

          <p>
            Vallejo&#39;s art was filled with heroic characters, often set in mythical or alien worlds, similar to the
            themes explored in many demoscene productions. Demos in the 1990s, especially on platforms like the Amiga,
            frequently featured surreal landscapes, epic narratives, and fantastical characters reminiscent of
            Vallejo&#39;s paintings.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a time when I loved Vallejo&#39;s art. It was a fascinating blend of imagination and breathtaking
            realism, with vivid portrayals of fantasy worlds populated by powerful, heroic figures and fantastical
            creatures. Vallejo&#39;s mastery of anatomy and attention to detail brought his subjects to life. I used to
            feel a true sense of awe and wonder when looking at his paintings. Back then, I felt that his work struck
            a balance between strength and beauty, craftsmanship and adventure.

          <p>
            These days, I&#39;m not so sure. I&#39;ve grown older, and my tastes have changed. I still admire Vallejo&#39;s work,
            but now I find it a bit too slick, idealized, and repetitive. I&#39;ve come to appreciate rougher, more
            abstract, and more experimental art styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked up Boris Vallejo, and by all accounts, he is in his 80s, alive and well. He collaborates with his
            artist wife
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julie Bell</a>,
            continues to produce and successfully sell their artwork online at
            <a href="https://www.borisjulie.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">borisjulie.com</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, while reminiscing about Vallejo&#39;s paintings, I realized I might have found a topic for a drawing.

          <p>
            As of September 2024,
            <a href="https://demozoo.org/productions/tagged/boris-vallejo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 35 images</a>
            submitted by sceners on Demozoo are tagged with &#34;boris-vallejo&#34; though the tagging is probably not
            comprehensive. Given his significant influence on the demoscene, Boris Vallejo even has entries on both
            <a href="https://demozoo.org/sceners/91415/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demozoo.org</a> and

          <p>
            The other artist mentioned in the results.txt was the Japanese artist
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajime_Sorayama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hajime Sorayama</a>. He is best known for his hyper-realistic erotic robots and cyborgs. His work explores the fusion of man
            and machine, often focusing on eroticism, fetishism, and the beauty of artificial forms. Sorayama rose to
            international fame in the 1980s and has influenced various fields, from fine art to commercial design,
            including contributions to film, music, and fashion. For the young men in the demoscene, this was a
            perfect combination.

          <p>
            Over the years, Boris Vallejo and his long-time collaborator Julie Bell had other intersections with
            computers in the 1990s. They painted box art for computer and video games such as the fantasy role-playing
            game <em>Dragon Wars</em>, the platform shooter <em>Turrican</em>, the side-scrolling fantasy beat-&#39;em-up
            <em>Golden Axe</em>, and the delightful underwater adventure <em>Ecco the Dolphin</em>. Here is a
            <a href="https://vgdensetsu.net/2_BorisVallejo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of computer and video game box art credits by Boris Vallejo</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vallejo&#39;s influence on sceners was unquestionable. Below are more examples of Vallejo&#39;s artwork used in
            demoscene productions. Many of these artworks were digitized or scanned, which doesn&#39;t require any
            artistry. It&#39;s a cheap and easy way to get good graphics for a demo.

          <p>
            Scanned paintings are quite controversial in the scene. In a blog post by a scener called <em>Danny</em>,
            who used to work for the computer game company Eidos Interactive, he does not like the practice of using
            scanned images of paintings and then declaring them as your own work. But he also does not find critics
            great who condemn sceners who copy paintings but openly admit that they are copies. He even wrote that it is the
            main reason he left the scene and would no longer submit any graphics for competitions. His post,
            <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/disint.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disintegration Of The Old Graphics Scene</a>, is worth reading. He wrote it in 1998, making it a reflection of that time period in the demoscene.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some of <em>Danny&#39;s</em> arguments sound distressingly familiar nowadays in the context of AI-generated
            art. In his post, he wrote:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              &#34;There are quite a number of artists (even some famous ones that get much respect) that have practiced
              so long on making a scanned image look hand drawn, that their lame efforts have become almost
              undetectable. There is almost no way of telling if the image is created through blood, sweat, and tears,
              or the powers of modern-day technology.
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Danny</em> does not outright condemn or defend copying. He just does not fully discount its value in a
            hobbyist community like the demoscene as long as it is clear that a work is a reproduction of another
            work. This is for me the culmination of his text:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              &#34;My point is that everybody copies. Some do it to learn, others do it to grasp a bit of fame in a very
              challenging environment. It&#39;s not just the artists that copy, it&#39;s the whole bloody scene. And everyone
              that makes any form of art. Artists just get all the crap for it because it&#39;s easiest to spot.&#34;
            </em>
          </blockquote>

            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/editions64k-book.jpg" alt="Works inspired by Vallejo in the Amiga demoscene book by Éditions64K"/></p>

          <p>
            Some graphics based on Vallejo paintings were actually pixel painted by the sceners, as can be seen in
            this article in
            <a href="https://www.editions64k.fr/product/demoscene-the-amiga-years-vol-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demoscene: the Amiga Years. Volume 1 1984-1993</a>
            by Éditions64k. This requires artistry and dedication.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/suny.jpg" alt="Suny&#39;s Vallejo"/></p>

          <p>
            It is amazing how many demoscene pixel artists in the 1990s got their inspiration or motives from Boris
            Vallejo. <em>Suny</em> wrote in the Éditions64K book about the Amiga demoscene:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              &#34;My main influence was Boris Vallejo who seems to have inspired a lot of artists at the time. I then got
              interested in design, photography, painting and animation.&#34;
            </em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Then <em>Suny</em> went on to close out his section of the Éditions64K book with the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              &#34;With time, I realized I was not a real artist. I had reached a very good technical level and could
              reproduce an existing image perfectly. However, this is not the definition of an artist, and I am not
              super creative. This is why I became a Technical Artist in the video game industry, and now I am working
              at Apple.&#34;
            </em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This started out somewhat discouraging, but then we see that his meticulous reproductions of Vallejo’s
            work and other pixel art helped him find his strengths and discover new professional roles.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a post on
            <a href="https://m.pouet.net/topic.php?which=9040&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pouet.net</a>,
            user <em>friol</em> asked what the point of re-drawing paintings by others actually is. He even
            specifically referred to sceners who copy Boris Vallejo&#39;s work:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              &#34;Oh well... I knew the demoscene was ripping Boris Vallejo, but not that much (we are talking of at
              least of one hundred pictures). But while some pictures are... I would call them &#34;re-elaborations&#34;,
              others are 1-1 copies.</em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Another user, <em>gaspode</em>, replied to <em>friol&#39;s</em> post:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              &#34;That&#39;s the dark side of the scene, I think. I can not understand why obviously talented people copy
              pictures nearly 1:1. Even if they were re-drawn or re-pixeled or whatever, they are still copys for me
              (because the idea, colors and structure was stolen). Other people apparently don&#39;t have problems with
              that but for me everytime I discover such a thing my respect for the copying artist decreases and first
              of all I cannot enjoy their future artworks anymore, cause I always think they could have been copied.&#34;
            </em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This opinion is well-supported by many sceners. User <em>ok3anos</em> pointed out that there is another
            side to copying artwork as long as the original artist gets credited:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              &#34;Well, consider this: In painting, masters have always been copied by the apprentices to let them learn
              the basis techniques.</em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            <em>ok3anos</em> reply can be interpreted as a defense of copying artwork as long as the scener remains
            honest. A link can be found in this thread on pouet that points to the
            <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy site</a>. You can find a
            gallery of images created by sceners but copied from other artists. There are a lot of examples of swiped
            Vallejo art.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/no-copy.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the No Copy website showing how a scener copied Vallejo&#39;s painting of a merman and a mermaid copulating"/></p>

          <p>
            The first thing that strikes me, just looking at the swipes on the
            <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy</a> site, is how often
            Vallejo&#39;s painting of the merman and the mermaid was copied. I never wanted to know what it looks like
            when merpeople have sex. The second thing that strikes me is that many of the graphics definitely look
            like full scans or collages of partial scans.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet, I think some of them are not scans but incredible reproductions. If my suspicion is true, I
            personally believe it takes a lot of craft to reproduce a painting as pixel art with the comparatively low
            resolution and limited color palette of a Commodore Amiga or a PC with VGA graphics. The most commonly
            used graphics mode for a regular Amiga was 320 x 256 with 32 colors (or 64 colors if extra halfbrite mode
            was used). The later AGA chipset in the Amiga 1200 and 4000 had a graphics mode comparable to the PC&#39;s VGA
            graphics. When the <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy</a> site
            was published in the second half of the 1990s, the most common VGA mode used for pixel graphics was 320 x
            200 with 256 colors, though some people used the higher resolution of 640 x 480, also with 256 colors. It
            takes patience and a lot of precision to copy Vallejo&#39;s art in a pixel paint program like
            <em>Deluxe Paint</em> or <em>Brilliance</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            My journey through Vallejo&#39;s influence on the demoscene brought me to the essay
            <a href="https://tarnkappe.info/jurassic-pack/an-original-picture-253480.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Original Picture</a>
            written in 2007 by
            <em>Lars <a href="https://demozoo.org/sceners/10963/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghandy</a> Sobiraj</em>, the main editor of the longest running Amiga diskmag
            <a href="https://demozoo.org/productions/tagged/jurassic-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jurassic Pack</a>. He is very critical of pixel artists and graphicians who copy art or photos. He not only condemns scans
            but even folks who hand-pixel their graphics based on someone else&#39;s paintings.</p>

          <p>He mentions a traditional,
            analog technique in which a grid is overlaid on both the original image and the drawing surface. This
            allows the copying artist to focus on replicating one small part at a time. This method ensured accurate
            proportions and alignment, helping the artist recreate the image in precise detail. However, he does not
            consider this technique to be high art.
          </p>

          <p>Lars Sobiraj writes:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              &#34;The biggest shame with copied motives are the artists never telling others if it was copied or not.
              They just secretly hope not to be discovered by the scene police.&#34;
            </em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            I actually support this statement. If you copy something, then make it clear what you have done. This is the
            bile-filled finale of <em>Lars Sobiraj&#39;s</em> essay, like a necromancer&#39;s curse thrown upon copying artists (the spelling is
            unchanged from the original):

            I understand the feeling of betrayal one might feel when confronted with artists who so obviously cheat.
            Yet I feel that this is also a bit too harsh.
          </p>

          <p>
            All that being said, I don&#39;t think copying Vallejo&#39;s art is reprehensible as long as you credit the
            original artist and learn something from the recreation, perhaps by altering it enough to make it
            distinct.
          </p>

          <p>
            Criticizing other artists for copying the works of Boris Vallejo becomes somewhat ironic when we consider
            Vallejo&#39;s own creative process. Vallejo often uses models and bodybuilders as references, photographing
            them in specific poses, and then using these images as a foundation for his paintings. In this way,
            imitation plays a significant role even in his artistic method.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, what distinguishes Vallejo is his remarkable ability to synthesize and transform these real-life
            references into something new and beautiful through his extraordinary skill with paint and brush. His
            artistry lies not just in copying but in elevating these references into highly imaginative and dynamic
            works, blending realism with fantasy. This process shows that while imitation may be part of art, true
            creativity comes from how those references are interpreted and reimagined.

          <h2 id="vallejo-03">How I Learned Not To Worry And Love Color Limitations</h2>

          <p>
            I wanted to copy a Vallejo painting in my own style, using a super limited color palette. And, of course,
            I&#39;d give credit to good ole Boris! But first, I need to wax poetic about the beauty of limited color
            palettes.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/ochre-palette.jpg" alt="The four shades of ochre that I wanted to use for my recreation of a Vallejo painting"/></p>

          <p>
            I used to paint pixel art on an Atari ST, which was limited to 16 colors on screen at the same time from a
            palette of 512 available shades. I always found this limiting and frustrating, especially considering that
            the Atari ST&#39;s main competitor, the Commodore Amiga, could display 32 and even 64 colors from 4,096
            available shades.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, I started participating in graphics competitions at demoparties, using ridiculously limited six- to
            eight-color palettes. That&#39;s when I discovered an interesting challenge.
          </p>

          <p>
            There&#39;s something exciting about working within a limited color palette. I found that the constraints
            forced me to focus more on composition, shapes, and contrast. I had to make the most of the few colors I
            had.
          </p>

          <p>
            It might be unfair to call the limited color palette required for the Evoke graphics compo &#34;old school&#34;
            (or &#34;old skool,&#34; if you&#39;re too cool for &#34;school&#34;). There are no restrictions on resolution, meaning I can
            use much higher resolutions than any retro &#34;old school&#34; machine was capable of. The results can look quite
            modern, and the style can be deliberately atmospheric due to the limited color palette.

          <h2 id="vallejo-05">Drawing A Vallejo in Line Art and Four Colors</h2>

          <p>
            So I decided to challenge myself by limiting a drawing to four colors. As a callback to the old days of
            the demoscene, I used a Boris Vallejo painting as my model. I chose Vallejo&#39;s &#34;Gillkarth&#39;s Odyssey (The
            Axe Man)&#34; from 1998. I used Procreate on my iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil. I absolutely adore Procreate.
            It is a phenomenally frictionless and intuitive painting tool.
          </p>

          <p>
            I ended up quite happy with my copy of it as line art. After a few dead ends in coloring, I was also
            pleased with how it turned out using only four colors.

            There was one odd thing I only realized while making the drawing: I have no idea what the barbarian fellow
            in the center is swinging his axe at. It might be that he&#39;s trying to chop into the snake, which is
            actually facing away from him and minding its own business. Or maybe he&#39;s attacking the viewer of the
            image. It could even be that he&#39;s being influenced by the two demon-like creatures behind him to attack.
            In the original image, his eyes are red, as though he&#39;s possessed. To this day, I don&#39;t know what this
            person is up to.
          </p>

          <p>
            I actually only learned that he&#39;s <em>not</em> Conan after I had started the drawing. I asked on the
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConanTheBarbarian/comments/1fribzp/when_did_boris_vallejo_paint_this_picture_of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conan Reddit,</a>
            if anyone had more information about the painting, and I was quickly corrected. Reddit user
            <em>mattmirth</em> provided the painting&#39;s real name. And another user wrote the following comment and got the most upvotes:
          </p>
          <blockquote>            
            <em>&#34;Every Boris Vallejo painting is Conan, he just doesn&#39;t know it. /s&#34;.</em>&#34;
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            I had a lot of fun drawing this piece. I learned a lot about working within color limitations and how to
            make the most of them. It also rekindled my appreciation for the art of Boris Vallejo. While I might not be
            a super fan of his work anymore, I can see why he was so popular and influential. I understand why so many pixel
            artists copied his work.
