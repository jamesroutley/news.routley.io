    <p>I realize it&#39;s gauche to blog about some shit you saw on bluesky but yesterday I saw a post that encapsulated so much of what has been bumming me out about the rise of coding agents over the last year. this dread had been slowly rising from seeing blogs about using claude code from your phone while getting ready for work, while commuting, while waiting to pick your kids up from school, but it&#39;s come to a head.</p>

<p>now <em>obviously</em> the opinions of founder-brained SF social bubble weirdos should be immediately discounted; they are the spiders georg of this industry. but at the same time they are playing into the dreams of management, the worker that never stops working, that&#39;s always online, that&#39;s infinitely Productive, always shipping, always wants to get back to work. I imagine this archetype exists in other industries but my experience is limited to tech so I will stick to that.</p>
<p>my fear is that this will become the norm. anecdotal evidence tells me that more and more companies are adopting AI for their engineers to use, encouraging (and in some cases requiring) its use in an effort to boost productivity, despite no actual evidence pointing to these improvements and <em>Anthropic-funded</em> research indicating that AI usage reduces skill retention.</p>
<p>so where does this lead us? we know that some <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/26/nx-s1-5567995/why-the-996-schedule-is-capturing-the-interest-of-silicon-valley-leadership">US tech companies are starting to embrace the &#34;996&#34; schedule</a> popularized in China&#39;s tech industry. enforced usage of coding agents makes that push even easier—is it really work if all you&#39;re doing is telling the computer what to do and then reviewing it to make sure it didn&#39;t do anything wrong and also babysitting it all hours of the day?</p>
<p>many have already observed that coding agents, which require constant attention and often generate low-quality code with (by design) random results, are a slot machine. they are loot boxes. they are gambling. you are constantly pulling the lever and hoping you get the SSR SaaS Passive Income product. you will not get this, but <em>maybe</em> you will. just one more prompt, one more pull, one more revision, one more go at being Absolutely Right.</p>
<p>if you suffer from token anxiety, you have a gambling addiction. I&#39;m sorry that it&#39;s not being formally treated as such, but you can take some solace in the fact that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/for-many-players-lootboxes-are-a-crisis-thats-already-here/">novel forms of gambling often take time to be recognized</a>.</p>
<p>now we can put our thinking caps on and follow a pretty easy chain of events. coding agents can trigger our gambling instincts with slot machine-like behavior; tech companies are pushing engineers to work more and encouraging or enforcing the use of coding agents to get there; gambling is addictive; heavy users of coding agents self-report symptoms of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>you see where this is going, right? by enforcing the use of inherently addictive technology in the workplace, employers are (whether intentionally or not) making their workers addicted to work. this seems bad!</p>
<p>one has to wonder how common this will become. will this become the norm? obviously there will be companies with a shred of ethics and empathy for their workers that choose to buck this trend, but if they become the minority there will be fewer and fewer jobs for those who value having free time. we&#39;ve already reached a point where trying to get a job in this industry requires a gradual erosion of ethics and standards, how much worse does that get?</p>
<p>all I know is that if we keep down this road, I&#39;m gonna bail out to get HVAC certified and make youtube videos about fucked up commercial systems. I can&#39;t do this shit forever.</p>
