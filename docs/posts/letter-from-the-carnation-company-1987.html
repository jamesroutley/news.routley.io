     Dear Mr. Pleacher:

     We appreciate the interest you expressed in examining 
     the height-to-diameter relationship of containers used 
     in our food products. A 1:1 ratio of height versus diameter 
     is the most efficient use of material, if only the surface 
     area of material is considered. However, there are many other 
     factors which must be considered when designing a can for a 
     particular product. Listed below are some of these other factors:

     1) Thermal Processing -- There is an inverse relationship between 
        the most efficient design for cans relative to surface area and 
        the amount of processing time required to sterilize the product 
        contained within. In other words, a tall thin can or short wide
        can will require considerably less processing time and energy to 
        achieve commercial sterility than a can which is nearly equal in 
        height and diameter.

     2) Strength Requirements -- During thermal processing, considerable 
        internal pressure develops. This pressure can cause the ends of 
        the can to become permanently distorted.  Because of this, ends on 
        most cans are made of metal which is substantially thicker than 
        that used in the can cylinder. Therefore, there is not a simple 
        cost-to-surface area relationship relative to metal. As this can 
        becomes taller and the end becomes smaller, thinner metal can be 
        used in both the cylinder and the ends.

     3) Can Manufacturing Line Changeover Time -- Virtually all can lines 
        run a variety of can sizes.  The time required to change over from 
        one can size to another is considerably less if only can height is 
        changed, rather than height and diameter. In addition. since the 
        same ends can be used if only the height is changed, the machinery 
        used to manufacture ends does not have to be changed over to a  
        different diameter. Reduced changeover time translates into reduced 
        downtime and increased line efficiency.

     4) Scrap Loss -- Generally, more metal scrap is generated as the 
        diameter is increased.

     5) Warehouse and Shipping Efficiency -- Smaller diameter cans make more 
        efficient use of packaging and shipping space.

     As you can see, cost and efficiency of a container are related to factors 
     other than just the amount of material used.  These are just a few of the 
     factors which must be taken into consideration when designing a can. We 
     hope that you now better understand that container design is not quite as 
     simple as minimizing surface area.

     Once again, thank you for your genuine interest.

     Sincerely,
