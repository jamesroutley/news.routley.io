    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p id="dateline">Wednesday May 1, 2024 — Brooklyn, New York</p><p>This post is a explanation of how to replace the battery in a Anubis CGM transmitter. If you don’t know what that means, just ignore this post, it’s not for you. This just isn’t explained anywhere else on the web so I want to write it down both for other people and for myself.</p><p>You will need:</p><ul><li>Your Anubis CGM transmitter</li><li>A silver oxide 386 watch battery (these are uncommon and best ordered online)</li><li>A small pack of <a href="https://sugru.com/what-is-sugru">Sugru</a>. A color other than grey is best, to provide contrast with the body of the CGM next time you replace the battery. (also most easily found online)</li><li>A xacto knife or similar</li><li>Tweezers (optional)</li><li>Plastic wrap (optional, if you want to use your CGM immediately after changing the battery)</li></ul><p>The steps:</p><ul><li>Use the xacto knife to slit the existing Sugru covering the battery.</li><li>Use the tweezers or tip of the xacto knife to pull off the Sugru.</li><li>Remove the dead battery. This may be a little tricky, but once you remove enough Sugru it should fairly easily pop out.</li><li>Ensure that you have removed as much of the old Sugru as possible.</li><li>Put in the new battery. The side with writing on it should face up.</li><li>Re-seal the battery with Sugru.<ul><li>Put a small blob of Sugru over the battery and thoroughly push it in.</li><li>Use the back of the xacto knife to scrape off all of the Sugru that’s not flush with the body of the transmitter.</li></ul></li><li>Wait 24 hours before use, or cover the exposed Sugru with plastic wrap before putting the transmitter in the sensor. This will allow the Sugru to cure without sticking to the sensor.</li></ul><p>A few notes about the process:</p><ul><li>Be careful around water for the first 24 hours, since water can interfere with the Sugru curing process.</li><li>If you use the Anubis CGM with a Tandem insulin pump, it won’t recognize the transmitter after you change the battery. To work around this, change the transmitter ID to some random incorrect transmitter ID, wait for it to tell you it can’t find the transmitter, then change the transmitter ID back to the correct ID.</li><li>The transmitter will be in “deep sleep” mode after you replace the battery, so you will not see the Bluetooth signal. It is awoken from deep sleep by being put into a sensor, although you can also wake it by covering the two metal pads on the bottom with a wet paper towel for five minutes, if you want to confirm that it works before putting it in the sensor.</li></ul><p>I hope this was helpful!</p></section><section><p><a href="https://notebook.wesleyac.com/">☙</a></p></section><section><details><summary title="Changelog"><picture><img alt="changelog" src="https://notebook.wesleyac.com/icons/history.svg"/></picture></summary></details></section></article></div>
