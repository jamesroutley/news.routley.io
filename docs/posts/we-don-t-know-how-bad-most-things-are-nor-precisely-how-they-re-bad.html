The space of possible subjects is huge, so on average your discernment is terrible, relative to what it could be. This is a serious problem if you create a machine that does everyone&#39;s job for them.</i></p><p id="block1"><i><strong>See also: </strong></i><a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail"><i>Reality has a surprising amount of detail</i></a><i>. (You lack awareness of how bad your staircase is and precisely how your staircase is bad.) You don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know. </i><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FowdGim3fdDjqqgHS/the-pervasive-illusion-of-seeing-the-complete-world\"><i>You forget your own blind spots, shortly after you notice them.</i></a></p><p id="block2">I recently played in an orchestra, as a violinist accompanying a piano soloist who was playing a concerto. My &#39;stand partner&#39; (the person I was sitting next to) has a day job as a piano tuner.</p><p id="block3">I loved the rehearsal, and heard nothing at all wrong with the piano, but immediately afterwards, the conductor and piano soloist hurried over to the piano tuner and asked if he could tune the piano in the hours before the concert that evening. Annoyed at the presumptuous request, he quoted them his exorbitant Sunday rate, which they hastily agreed to pay. </p><p id="block4">I just stood there, confused.</p><p id="block5">(I&#39;m really good at noticing when things are out of tune. Rather than beat my chest about it, I&#39;ll just hope you&#39;ll take my word for it that my pitch discrimination skills are <i>definitely</i> not the issue here. The point is, as developed as my skills are, there is a whole other level of discernment you can develop if you&#39;re a career piano soloist or 80-year-old conductor.)</p><p id="block6">I asked to sit with my new friend the piano tuner while he worked, to satisfy my curiosity. I expected to sit quietly, but to my surprise he seemed to want to show off to me, and talked me through what the problem was and how to fix it.</p><p id="block7">For the unfamiliar, most keys on the piano cause a hammer to strike three strings at once, all tuned to the same pitch. This provides a richer, louder sound. In a badly out-of-tune piano, pressing a single key will result in three very different pitches. In an in-tune piano, it just sounds like a single sound. Piano notes can be out of tune with each other, but they can also be out of tune with <i>themselves</i>. </p><p id="block8">Additionally, in order to solve &#39;God&#39;s prank on musicians&#39; (where He cruelly rigged the structure of reality such that <span><span><span><span aria-label="\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^n \neq 2^m"><span aria-hidden="true"><span><span><span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span><span><span><span>3</span></span></span><span><span><span>2</span></span></span><span></span></span><span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>n</span></span></span></span><span><span>≠</span></span><span><span><span><span>2</span></span></span><span><span><span>m</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> for any integers n, m but IT&#39;S SO CLOSE CMON MAN ) some intervals must be tuned very slightly sharp on the piano, so that after 11 stacked &#39;equal-tempered&#39; 5ths, each of them 1/50th of a semitone sharp, we arrive back at a perfect octave multiple of the original frequency.</p><p id="block9">I knew all this, but the keys really did sound in tune with themselves and with each other! It sounded really nicely in tune! (For a piano). </p><h2 id="_Hear_how_it_rolls_over__">&#34;Hear how it rolls over?&#34;</h2><p id="block10">The piano tuner raised an eyebrow and said &#34;listen again&#34; and pressed a single key, his other hand miming a soaring bird. </p><p id="block11">&#34;Hear how it rolls over?&#34; </p><p id="block12">He was right. Just at the beginning of the note, there was a slight &#39;flange&#39; sound which quickly disappeared as the note was held. It wasn&#39;t really audible repeated &#39;beating&#39; - the pitches were too close for that. It was the beginning of one very long slow beat, most obvious when the higher frequency overtones were at their greatest amplitudes, i.e. during the attack of the note.</p><p id="block13">So the piano&#39;s notes were in tune with each other, kinda, on average, and the notes were mostly in tune with themselves, but some had tiny deviations leading to the piano having a poor sound.</p><h2 id="_Are_any_of_these_notes_brighter_than_others__">&#34;Are any of these notes brighter than others?&#34;</h2><p id="block14">That wasn&#39;t all. He played a scale and said &#34;how do the notes sound?&#34; I had no idea. Like a normal, in-tune piano? </p><p id="block15">&#34;Do you hear how this one is brighter?&#34; </p><p id="block16">&#34;Not really, honestly...&#34; </p><p id="block17">He pulled out the hammers and got a little tool out of his bag, jabbing the little felt pad at the end of the hammer with some spikes to loosen it up.</p><p id="block18">&#34;The felt gets compacted with use, we need to make sure each key has similar density to its neighbours so it doesn&#39;t sound brighter than them.&#34;</p><p id="block19">He replaced the hammers and played the scale again. I wish I could say it made a world of difference, but I could hardly tell anything had changed. He, on the other hand, looked satisfied.</p><h2 id="_Yeah_the_beats_get_slower__but_they_don_t_get_slower_at_an_even_rate____">&#34;Yeah the beats get slower, but they don&#39;t get slower at an even rate...&#34;</h2><p id="block20">He began playing the minor 7th interval, walking the notes up and down the piano in parallel. I know enough about piano tuning to know he was listening to the beating between the justly tuned 7th in the lower note&#39;s overtone and the upper note. </p><p id="block21">&#34;Hear that?&#34; &#34;The beating? Yeah I know about that.&#34; &#34;No,  listen, it doesn&#39;t change speed smoothly.&#34; As he moved the interval downwards along the piano, the beating got slower, as expected. But it felt like it got slower at a slightly uneven rate, which was obvious now he pointed it out, but I would never have known to listen for it. Many adjustments later, the beating now slowed down very smoothly as he played his descending intervals.</p><h2 id="_This_string_probably_has_some_rust_on_it_somewhere__">&#34;This string probably has some rust on it somewhere.&#34;</h2><p id="block22">Moving on to the highest keys, he hammered down one of the notes and said &#34;hear that?&#34;. &#34;YES!&#34; I said, eager to show that I could hear the &#39;rolling over&#39; sound now, clear as day. &#34;So you&#39;ll tune the three strings to each other better?&#34; &#34;Nope, these ones are tuned just fine, it&#39;s just one of these strings is rusted, or has a dent in it, or it&#39;s stretched slightly, so it&#39;s producing slightly incorrect overtones especially when it&#39;s struck hard. These are called &#34;false overtones.&#34; &#34;What can you do about it?&#34; &#34;Probably nothing at this stage, they&#39;ll need a new string or something more time consuming than we have time for today. But honestly, this is splitting hairs here, nobody really cares that much about false overtones, you just get used to hearing them unless you&#39;re only ever listening to, like, the best Steinways at concert halls or something.&#34;</p><p id="block23">I asked him: &#34;why don&#39;t you use a fancy electronic tuner for this, and just have a table to look up the frequencies for each string, and tune it that way?&#34;</p><p id="block24"><span>He scoffed &#34;there are some people who do that, but that really only gets you close, and they&#39;d have to finish by ear anyway, especially with the sort of pianos you typically have to work with, since you really need to finesse how the overtones interact with each other, and it&#39;s not guaranteed that the overtones are going to be exactly what they&#39;re supposed to be, given variations in string thickness, stretching, corrosion, dents, the harp flexing, you know</span>... <span>The whole thing is a negotiation with the piano, you can&#39;t just read it its orders and expect it to sound good.&#34;</span></p><p id="block25"><span>If it weren&#39;t for the piano soloist (the conductor probably didn&#39;t notice, he just knew to defer to the piano soloist&#39;s concerns), we would have played the concert on a very slightly out-of-tune piano, and then</span>...</p><p id="block26">What?</p><p id="block27">Nobody in the audience would probably notice. Certainly not in the specific. Nobody is standing up and saying, &#34;there, see how G above middle C has one string that is 0.2hz out of tune with the others?!&#34; Nobody is standing up and saying &#34;that piano is out of tune, what a travesty.&#34; Perhaps some of the more sensitive listeners would have felt some vague sense that the piano could have sounded nicer, that maybe the hall needs a better piano, or something.</p><p id="block28">Did the piano sound better, after all that work? Yeah... it did, I think. Hard to say. I&#39;d like to pretend it was some colossal difference, but that&#39;s really the point. My big stupid ears are not the best judge here. Just trust the people who have the best discernment.</p><p id="block29">Only a very few people possess the level of discernment needed to know how bad your local concert hall&#39;s piano is, and precisely how it is bad. </p><p id="block30">If their art dies out, maybe nobody will know how bad all the pianos are. <span>And then we&#39;ll all have slightly worse pianos than we would otherwise have.</span> And I mean if that&#39;s the way things are going to go, then let&#39;s just steer the Earth into the Sun, because what&#39;s the point of any of this.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><p><span><span><div><div><div><div><div id="FGg2yKXPnENaoNyqZ"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Progress towards a robotic piano tuner: <a href="https://github.com/levush/Entropy-Piano-Tuner">Entropy piano tuner</a> attempts to accommodate &#34;variations in string thickness, stretching, corrosion, dents, the harp flexing&#34;, etc. by minimizing the entropy of the power spectrum. Using it should be better than mindlessly tuning to a digital guitar tuner.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230129113524/http://piano-tuner.org/test">the website</a>, professional pianists still prefer a human-tuned piano, but no one else can tell the difference. And the general opinion on piano tuner message boards seems to be that it&#39;s not quite good enough to replace a professional tuner&#39;s judgment.</p>
</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div id="ks9vHyfvLqofDKper"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>I think many people, particularly intellectuals, assume it&#39;s obvious that ultra-fine quality distinctions are a worthwhile pursuit. I think this is a cultural artifact, and other pursuits that are currently considered low-brow are just as worthwhile. Quality is real, as Phaedrus argues, but it is also &#34;just what you like&#34;.  That exquisite piano solo on that close-to-perfectly tuned piano (wow, &#34;god&#39;s joke on musicians&#34; must drive folks like that nuts:) is high art, but equally so is the juxtaposition of multiple notes and lyrics to produce an emotional effect. I personally find the art of rock and roll more impressive, since it incorporates language and ideas along with multiple interacting musical themes. The tuning of the guitar being perfect is much less the point. This makes that art harder to evaluate, since the perfect juxtaposition for one brain won&#39;t work for most others&#39; - but that only matters if you need art to be an easily judgeable competition.</p>
<p>In addition, once people are replaced, the AI will be a far better piano tuner than the guy you mentioned. But I don&#39;t care one way or the other. Nor do most humans. They mostly want a safe comfortable place to live, adequate palatable food to eat, and people to talk to about things that interest them. High art is gravy, and there are so many ways to make high art that losing one particularly type shouldn&#39;t concern us much. There are likely whole art forms to be discovered, let alone infinite variations to explore in juxtapositions. Fun theory posits that fun is infinite (or near enough), and that doesn&#39;t depend on how precisely you can tune a piano.</p>
</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="bNhHyPFmzdY8746D3"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>A messy onset featuring transient beating caused by a piano key being out of tune with itself is usually insignificant, but it is not necessarily insignificant if it occurs during a mellow, legato passage, where that particular note plays an especially central role. It can ruin the phrase completely. Still only in the ears of skilled musicians, but if you say this is unimportant because skilled musicians are vastly outnumbered by the general population, then you wind up creating a strong disincentive from advancing in skill beyond a certain point, and you wind up giving least consideration to those people who have <i>most </i>to do with music.</p><blockquote><p>That exquisite piano solo on that close-to-perfectly tuned piano (wow, &#34;god&#39;s joke on musicians&#34; must drive folks like that nuts:) is high art, but equally so is the juxtaposition of multiple notes and lyrics to produce an emotional effect.</p></blockquote><p>Not equally so, but moreso. Singing, dancing, figure skating, etc. are the highest performance arts because less mediated. They place greater psychological demands on the performers; strain their spirits to the utmost. There is something divine in it, to a degree beyond the divinity in instrumentalism. The emotional depth is greater because the performer needs by necessity to embody the emotions, and is faced with the audience without the protection of an instrument in the way. Psychologically it is a different caliber of performance. Even the greatest concert pianists (Horowitz, for example), can never quite match the <i>olympian </i>quality of the greatest singers.</p><blockquote><p>I personally find the art of rock and roll more impressive</p></blockquote><p>And for that reason, you would be among those harmed if quality distinctions were eroded in rock and roll. Popular audiences who have only a transient interest and might switch to Billie Eilish the next day will not love rock and roll the way you do, and so they will not care if good rock and roll becomes replaced with total garbage that sounds superficially similar. They will not know the difference. You would, and you would mourn the loss, but when it comes to classical, you side with the unknowing masses, for all that they could just as well be kept occupied by any other entertainment. Netflix, for example.</p><blockquote><p>along with multiple interacting musical themes.</p></blockquote><p>This is a strange statement. Rock is much more monodic than common practice period music. Even music from the classical period, which basically invented monody, was more polyphonic than most rock.</p><blockquote><p>High art is gravy</p></blockquote><p>High art (theatre in particular), is the centrepiece of just about every great civilisation in known history. The works of Aristotle, as they were preserved and studied by the Catholic church, were not what sparked the Renaissance. The humanistic works were.</p><blockquote><p>and there are so many ways to make high art that losing one particularly type shouldn&#39;t concern us much.</p></blockquote><p>The arts are connected and many things you take for granted (novels and rock music) could not have arisen except out of a canon with high art at its centre. Novels came out of chronicles and epics, and rock music features chords, which are not such an obvious idea as they might seem. Chordal music came very gradually out of a very long tradition of polyphonic choral music. The discovery of antique classics was what sparked the renaissance, so it should be obvious at a glance (or at the very least from Chesterton&#39;s fence esque reasoning), that losing connection with that canon would be a very serious loss.</p><p>Edited to add:</p><p>Incidentally, I think it&#39;s only intellectuals who would question the value of exquisite quality and the fine discernment of a skilled craftsman.

Lehmann</a>,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230129113524/http://alt.hfm-wuerzburg.de/about-us/administration/olbrich.html">Master piano builder Burkard Olbrich</a> and Michael Kohl. To this end two structurally identical Steinway-C grands were compared, one of them professionally tuned by ear and the other one according to the EPT (see figure). 28 pianists played and compared the two instruments in a double-blind test, evaluating them in a questionnaire.</p><p>The participants can be divided roughly into two groups. The first group of 20 participants represents the semi-professional sector, including piano students at the University of Music and serious amateurs. The second group of eight people consists of professional pianists with many years of experience, including e.g. professors for piano playing at the University of Music.</p><p>Because of the small number of participants statistical statements are limited. Nevertheless, the test has led to a clear overall picture that can be summarized as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Pianists belonging to the group of semi-professional musicians do not show a clear preference for one of the two grands.</p></li><li><p>Pianists with a long professional experience show a statistically significant preference for the aurally tuned grand. Moreover, this grand is perceived as being more harmonic and in a better tune, exhibiting less beats than the electronically tuned instrument.</p></li></ul><p>In conclusion, it seems that the current version of the EPT generates tunings which can be considered as acceptable in a semi-professional context. On the other hand, the EPT cannot compete with high-quality aural tunings on a professional scale. However, given the fact that the EPT tunes randomly according to a very simple one-line formula this is not too surprising. What is surprising, though, is that the entropy-based method seems to produce acceptable results on a semi-professional scale.</p></blockquote><p>I wish this linked to a more substantive writeup of the test.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="w6s3oDbNkQnYEN9yQ"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>I agree that a link to a more substantive writeup would be very good… it’s hard to know what to make of the claim that “Pianists with a long professional experience show a statistically significant preference for the aurally tuned grand”, given that there were only 8 such pianists and 2 pianos (one tuned one way, one tuned the other way).</p>
<p>… also, this information comes to use from the website of this “entropy piano tuner”, which seems… well, I’d like to see another source, at least.</p>
<p>(Apparently, the creators of this “EPT” <a href="https://www-physik-uni--wuerzburg-de.translate.goog/aktuelles/neuigkeiten/single/news/neuer-tuner-fuer-klaviere-2/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">are themselves affiliated with the University of <em>Physics</em> Würzburg</a>, which certainly explains how/why they got the University of Music Würzburg involved in this test.)</p>
</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="7QLKzJjFc6myDL5YK"><div><div><div><div><div><p>To reach statistical significance, they must have tested each of the 8 pianists more than once.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="24kpYxevpnFZve8mc"><div><div><div><div><div><p>If there was a consensus among the 8 as to which tuning is better, that would be significant, right? Since the chance of that is 1/128 if they can&#39;t tell the difference. You can even get p &lt; 0.05 with one dissenter if you use a one-tailed test (which is maybe dubious). Of course we don&#39;t know what the data look like, so I&#39;m just being pedantic here.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div id="2haFoD9XCcqptjFc7"><div><div><div><div><div><div><blockquote>

<p>This seems to be a theme with very exact things - once you reach a certain level of required precision, the most effective approach switches from &#34;have a target value and a way of measuring the value&#34; to &#34;have something to compare with&#34;.

</blockquote>
<p>Contrary to you, I think its definitely possible there&#39;s someone in the audience who would have been able to tell the piano was slightly out of tune. But I also think more would have unconsciously noticed the music was very very slightly worse than what it could have been. Slightly less detail which you could notice and recognize perfection.</p>
<p>Maybe not so much of a loss or a gain in this circumstance, but definitely a loss. And if you compound this across all of society, if everything is 1% worse for no reason anyone can put their finger on anymore, you just have a worse world, with colors slightly dimmer, appliances slightly less ergonomic, fashion slightly less stylish, games, books, and movies slightly less meaningful.</p>
<p>I think in many circumstances you&#39;ll still be able to buy the high-quality thing, but it takes a while to get to economic equilibriums, and it would be nice if those selecting bundles of goods to sell (like a concert) remembered 1% better everything adds up before transitioning to lesser quality but cheaper goods.</p>
<p>I also think there&#39;s room for making AI produced products significantly better than the human produced ones, so that also should be kept in mind. If you can gain 1% by transitioning to AI, you should by my same logic.</p>

<p>Tuning the instrument may well have had a large effect on the audience&#39;s experience overall, because the pianist will play much better on an instrument they enjoy playing - it&#39;s a totally different experience hearing someone perform while they&#39;re enjoying their own art, vs someone who&#39;s distracted by an annoying F# that sounds slightly off in every scale.</p>

To quote the word exactly, the &#39;enshittification&#39; of everything we can buy and services we are provided is real. The best example of this high-quality clothing, but pretty much everything you can buy online at Amazon shows this too. It&#39;s important to be able to maintain quality separate of market dynamics, IMO, at least because some people value it (and consumers aren&#39;t really voting if there is no choice).</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="89xHpQ6FrnspQR8YP"><div><div><div><div><div><p>People do say this is the case, but I’m skeptical.

For example, first Amazon put storefronts out of business by allowing drop-shipping of cheaply manufactured goods with no warranty. Now, Temu is competing with Amazon by exploiting import tax loopholes, selling the same items at below production price, many of which contain pthalates and other chemical compounds at multiple times the safe standards. This is a standard trick for monopolisation pulled by large giants: they will then rack the prices back up once they have a stable user base, and start making profit. Uber did this.</p><p>The drop in clothing standard is real, though, because fast fashion didn&#39;t really exist until the 2000s.10 years is not far enough back: you need to go about 25-30. If I want high quality clothing made fairtrade, I now have to go on specialist websites like Good on You which compile databases of very niche companies and pay upwards of $100 for an item of clothing. I cannot get something that I expect to last long by walking into a department store.</p><p>Enshittification also exists in the apps and services that have been established via monopolisation or acquiring an existing user base.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="FnnqL2Rh4jtDBJCbx"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Only the people who want to buy from Temu buy from Temu. The existence of Temu does not reduce the availability of higher quality options.</p><p>While you can buy fast fashion articles, you can also buy outdoor fashion. If I buy a buttoned outdoor shirt today from Mammut today, it&#39;s not made from shitty cotton but material on which bacteria don&#39;t grow as easy and made from a material so that I can easily wash the shirt without any need for dry cleaning or ironing. As far as I can see it&#39;s also likely more durable. </p><p>Uniqlo is a department store and if I ask ChatGPT it suggests that it sells more durable clothing today than the average clothing in the 1990s.</p><p>It&#39;s possible to buy low-quality fast fashion but there are quality options available as far as clothing goes that simply didn&#39;t exist 25-30 years ago. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="vJpyGT7JrkioQ872d"><div><div><div><div><div><div><blockquote><p>Uniqlo is a department store and if I ask ChatGPT it suggests that it sells more durable clothing today than the average clothing in the 1990s.</p></blockquote><p>And if I ask Claude it tells me there have been many studies showing that ready-made clothing has generally declined in quality over time.

Claude says it &#34;concluded that the quality and durability of clothing has declined as the industry has shifted towards faster production cycles and lower prices.&#34; The report does say the industry has moved toward faster production cycles and lower prices (though it indicates that production costs have actually <i>risen</i>, leaving the authors quite worried about their profit margins), but does not, as far as I can tell, claim that quality and durability have declined.</li><li><strong>&#34;Valuing Our Clothes: The Cost of UK Fashion&#34; - Study by the Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme (WRAP) in the UK (2012)</strong> - This one actually exists!

Customers have reported that fabrics feel thinner and less durable, with some items showing signs of wear after just a few washes. Online reviews and consumer feedback suggest that the brand&#39;s earlier collections featured more robust construction and longer-lasting materials, while more recent offerings seem to prioritize cost-cutting over durability. This perceived decline in quality has sparked concern among long-time fans of the brand, who feel that Uniqlo&#39;s focus on fast fashion has come at the expense of the reliability and longevity that once set it apart.</p></blockquote><p>Gosh—that&#39;s just the opposite of what you said! Does this mean you&#39;ve been proven wrong? No, it means I told it to argue that Uniqlo&#39;s clothes have decreased in quality over time and it did, because LLMs will take any position you ask of them regardless of whether or not it&#39;s true.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div id="Ea7bDaq88Haga9pBd"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>I don&#39;t assume that all studies that Claude would give me are true.

<p>If you ask an LLM it gives you a lot of individual facts in a explanation that help with understanding. It helps with understanding the factors that go into a lot of current fashion being less durable and how those don&#39;t apply to Uniqlo or Mammut for that matter.</p>

Here, again, is ChatGPT:</p><blockquote><p>Several factors likely contributed to the perceived decline in quality at Uniqlo, reflecting broader trends in the fashion industry and specific business strategies the brand has pursued.</p><p>1. <strong>Cost-Cutting and Scale</strong>: As Uniqlo expanded globally, the need to maintain competitive pricing while increasing production volumes may have led to compromises in material quality. To keep costs low and meet growing demand, the company might have shifted to cheaper fabrics and production methods, sacrificing the durability and feel that initially attracted customers.</p><p>2. <strong>Fast Fashion Influence</strong>: Although Uniqlo markets itself as a provider of &#34;lifewear&#34; rather than fast fashion, its business model has increasingly incorporated elements of fast fashion, such as frequent new collections and quick production cycles. This shift often prioritizes speed and cost-efficiency over quality, resulting in garments that are less durable.</p><p>3. <strong>Supply Chain Pressures</strong>: Like many global retailers, Uniqlo has faced pressure from fluctuating raw material costs, labor costs, and logistical challenges. To mitigate these pressures, the company may have opted for lower-quality materials or reduced quality control measures in manufacturing processes.</p><p>4. <strong>Shifts in Consumer Expectations</strong>: As consumers have grown accustomed to low prices and frequent turnover in their wardrobes, brands like Uniqlo might have adjusted their offerings to meet these expectations, leading to a focus on affordability and trendiness over long-lasting quality.</p><p>5. <strong>Strategic Decisions</strong>: Uniqlo&#39;s parent company, Fast Retailing, has focused on aggressive expansion and maintaining high profitability. Strategic decisions to prioritize these goals over maintaining the brand&#39;s initial quality standards could have influenced the decline. The emphasis on rapid growth might have overshadowed the commitment to quality that once defined the brand.</p></blockquote><p>Did you verify what ChatGPT told you before you repeated it as fact?</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div id="426ounAExbBrFxWBQ"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>An anecdote from which I drew a similar conclusion to yours:</p><p>After the last piece, the audience asked for the encore.

<p>I think the tails basically always matter, and even though you can’t consciously register the differences between a well-tuned and an adequately-tuned piano, you still do subconsciously register the difference.</p>
<p>In particular, I’d expect that a concert with the same players, same instruments, same venue, same songs, etc but with only adequately-tuned instruments will (in expectation) be rated slightly worse than one with well-tuned instruments, even by those with untrained ears. I don’t think it will be rated as badly as those with trained ears would rate, but I do still expect the imperfections to add up to measureables.</p>

This kind of piano tuning is called &#34;just intonation.&#34; </p><p>So, the piano or any other instrument could be more precisely tuned so that music in a certain key sounds even better than it would on instruments tuned to a tempered scale. There is the potential for a story of greater perfection inside a story of seeking greater precision. Instead of taking this tack, the author refers to it as a kind of joke, invoking God&#39;s sense of humor, whereas this is actually an artifact of human ingenuity. Beginning in the 18th century, western musicians decided, &#34;yeah, this kind of tuning is good enough&#34; given the trade off of listening to a concert and music that includes the effect of key changes or tuning instruments for every key that the group plays in. </p><p>(Look up &#34;truck stop key change&#34; for even more fun and insights.)</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div id="BfkMXHxvkmpmymeD7"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/bestoflesswrong">LessWrong Review</a> runs every year to select the posts that have most stood the test of time.
