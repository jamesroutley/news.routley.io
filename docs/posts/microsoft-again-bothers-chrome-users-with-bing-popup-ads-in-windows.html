    <h1>Microsoft again bothers Chrome users with Bing popup ads in Windows</h1>

<p>Microsoft is once again harassing Google Chrome users on Windows 10 and Windows 11 with popup desktop advertisements promoting Bing and its GPT-4 Bing Chat platform.</p>
<p>However, due to the quality of the pixelated ads, some who received them <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/1beg1bi/is_this_microsoft_bing_popup_malware/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">were concerned</a> that they were being displayed by malware, even though the embedded links led directly to Microsoft.</p>
<p>Microsoft has since confirmed that the popup ads are legitimate, telling BleepingComputer that this is a one-time notification.</p>
<p>&#34;This is a one-time notification giving people the choice to set Bing as their default search engine on Chrome,&#34; Microsoft told BleepingComputer.</p>
<p>&#34;We value providing our customers with choice, so there is an option to dismiss the notification.&#34;</p>
<p>The unsolicited ads are believed to be shown when users have Google Chrome open and configured to use Google as the default search engine.</p>
<p>&#34;Chat with GPT-4 for free on Chrome! Get hundreds of daily chat turns with Bing AI,&#34; reads the popup advertisement.</p>
<p>The ad then says that clicking &#34;Yes&#34; will change your default Google Chrome search engine to Bing and install the Bing Service.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2024/03/15/microsoft-confirms-bing-pop-up-ads-in-chrome-on-windows-11-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WindowsLatest</a>, clicking the Yes button will manually install the &#34;<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/microsoft-bing-search-for/hkecabaloghleaicfhefejdijblljpco" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft Bing Search for Chrome</a>&#34; extension. This extension changes the default search for the address bar and the browser&#39;s New Tab Page (NTP) to Bing.</p>
<p>Google Chrome includes a security feature that defends against malicious extensions that hijack your search engine.</p>
<p>When Chrome detects that an extension has changed your default search engine, it will display a prompt asking whether you want to keep this change. This confirmation dialog is shown regardless of your initially configured search engine, whether that be Google, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, or Bing.</p>
<p>Like other search extensions, such as DuckDuckGo, when Google asks for this confirmation, the Bing extension displays a message asking users not to change it back.</p>
<p>&#34;Wait-don&#39;t change it back! If you do, you&#39;ll turn off Microsoft Bing Search for Chrome and lose access to Bing Search and wallpapers,&#34; reads the Bing extension&#39;s plea.</p>
<p>&#34;Select Keep it to continue searching with Microsoft Bing.&#34;</p>

<p>This is not the first time Microsoft has targeted Google with popup desktop ads, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/1545a9n/what_the_heck_is_this_bing_popup_within_chrome/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">previously using a similar one</a> in July 2023 to promote Bing Chat.</p>
<p>Both companies have historically targeted each other with competing ads in their search engines, applications, and even operating systems.</p>
<p>In 2020, Google and Microsoft targeted each other with <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/google-takes-aim-at-microsoft-edge-with-flurry-of-ads/" target="_blank">ads promoting their own browsers</a>, with <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/google-takes-aim-at-microsoft-edge-with-flurry-of-ads/" target="_blank">further ads shown in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>We will likely continue to see the browser and search engine wars in the future as both companies strive to control users&#39; data, browsing habits, and ad landscape.</p>
