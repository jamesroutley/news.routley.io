  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post describes the design and implementation of a runtime benchmark suite for measuring the
performance of Rust programs, which was recently added into the Rust compiler suite. I have recently
blogged about how the whole benchmark suite <a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/rustc/2023/08/18/rustc-benchmark-suite.html">works</a>,
so feel free to read that post first if you want to gather a bit more context.</p>

<p>I have worked on the runtime benchmark suite for almost a year, and my work was supported by
a <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/community-grants-program-awards-announcement-introducing-our-latest-project-grantees/">grant</a>
from the Rust Foundation and also by Futurewei. I’m very grateful to both! As always, I’m also thankful
to many people that have helped me with this project, such as <a href="https://github.com/nnethercote"><code>@nnethercote</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/lqd"><code>@lqd</code></a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum"><code>@Mark-Simulacrum</code></a>.</p>

<p>The Rust compiler (<code>rustc</code>) has had a “compilation time” benchmark suite for a long time. This benchmark
suite compiles a bunch of Rust crates with every new version of the compiler (basically after every
commit to the main branch) to check if the performance of <code>rustc</code> hasn’t regressed. This infrastructure
has been invaluable over the past years, as it both helps us quickly notice unexpected compiler performance
regressions, and it also gives us confidence that the performance of the compiler is steadily improving
over time.</p>

<p>Compilation times are very important, as they are often cited as one of the primary sources of
frustration by Rust developers. However, another crucial promise of Rust is that it generates
efficient programs. The existing benchmark suite did a great job of notifying us of regressions to
<em>compilation performance</em>, but it couldn’t tell us much of <em>runtime performance</em>, i.e. the
performance of Rust programs compiled by a given version of the Rust compiler.</p>

<p>The rest of this post describes the steps I took to implement support for an MVP (minimum viable product)
version of runtime benchmarks into <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf"><code>rustc-perf</code></a>, the Rust compiler benchmark suite.</p>


<p>Now, you might be wondering whether Rust really had <em>no</em> runtime performance benchmarks before my
project, as that seems unlikely. And indeed, the compiler, and especially the standard library,
has lots of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/core/benches/iter.rs">benchmarks</a>
that leverage the normal Rust benchmark machinery (using the <code>#[bench]</code> attribute and <code>cargo bench</code>).
However, these benchmarks are <em>microbenchmarks</em> that usually measure only very small pieces of Rust
code (for example, common iterator adaptor chains). But most importantly, these microbenchmarks are
executed only manually by <code>rustc</code> developers, typically when they are trying to optimize some part
of the standard library or the compiler.</p>

<p>Such benchmarks are definitely useful, however they are slightly orthogonal to what we wanted to
achieve with runtime benchmarks in <code>rustc-perf</code>. Our goals could be summarized with the following
two requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Run benchmarks automatically</strong> Same as with the compilation time benchmarks, we want to have a
set of benchmarks that execute automatically, after every commit. That is the only way to find
truly unexpected performance regressions.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Include “real-world” code</strong> Again, similar to the compilation time suite, which includes several
popular real-world crates (like <code>syn</code>, <code>serde</code> or <code>regex</code>), we would like to measure more realistic
pieces of Rust code. Not necessarily whole programs, as that would probably be too slow, but at least
some interesting parts of actual programs that are larger than microbenchmarks like
<code>vec.iter().filter(..).map(..).collect()</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea of runtime benchmarks in <code>rustc-perf</code> isn’t new, as the idea has been floated around more
than <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/69">seven years ago</a>. A comprehensive runtime
benchmark suite called <a href="https://github.com/anp/lolbench"><code>lolbench</code></a> was even created ~5 years ago.
However, it wasn’t integrated into <code>rustc-perf</code>, so it was not running automatically after each
commit, and its development was eventually discontinued.</p>

<p>During the last year, I have started contributing a lot to <code>rustc-perf</code>, and I thought that runtime
benchmarks would be a nice addition to our benchmark suite, so approximately one year ago, I set out
to make this idea a reality. I didn’t expect that it would take until the summer of this year to
implement an MVP version, but alas, that happens. Below I’ll describe the whole implementation process
step by step.</p>


<p>First, I needed to figure out how would the runtime benchmarks be measured and defined.
Since we already had a lot of infrastructure and mechanisms for compilation time benchmarks, I decided
to model the runtime benchmarks after them, so that we could better reuse our command-line interface,
database schema and also web UI.</p>

<p>Therefore, I decided on the two following things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each runtime benchmark would have a unique name, and a set of configuration parameters. For simplicity,
I didn’t actually add any parametrization to runtime benchmarks yet, so for now everything is just
compiled with <code>--release</code>, but in the future we can experiment with parametrizing e.g. link-time
optimizations (<code>off/thin/fat</code>), amount of codegen units used for compilation, panic strategy
(<code>unwind/abort</code>) or even the used codegen backend (<code>llvm/cranelift/gcc</code>).</li>
  <li>We would measure multiple metrics for each runtime benchmark, same as for compilation benchmarks.
For start, I decided on the following metrics:
    <ul>
      <li>Wall time</li>
      <li>Instruction count</li>
      <li>Cycle count</li>
      <li>Cache misses</li>
      <li>
        <p>Branch misses</p>

        <p>Especially the instruction count metric is important, since it tends to be quite stable, which
makes it ideal for comparisons between two benchmark artifacts and finding regressions.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After deciding on this initial design, I wanted to start implementing code for defining and running
the benchmarks locally using <code>rustc-perf</code>, so that we could experiment with it before integrating it
into the <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html">perf.RLO</a> server, database, GitHub bot, etc. As is often the case, when you need to
make large changes to an existing codebase, it might be a good idea to refactor it first. The part
of <code>rustc-perf</code> which actually executes benchmarks (called the <code>collector</code>) has evolved quite…
organically over the years, so instead of just piling additional code and special cases on top of it,
I decided to first refactor it quite substantially, to make follow-up work easier. This was done in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1435">#1435</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1440">#1440</a>.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Aside: a tip for approaching refactoring</summary>

  <p>When performing refactoring, sometimes it goes like this:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Ok, I need to refactor this struct to make it easier to use. Oh, it’s also used by this function,
which is too long, let’s split it. Hmm, after splitting that function, one of its parts should
really be moved to a separate module. Damn, this module is big and complicated, let’s untangle it.
Wait, this module uses a familiar struct… right, that’s the thing that I wanted to refactor in the
first place!</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>When you start refactoring a codebase, it can be tempting to go deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole
and rewrite too many things at once. This can sometimes lead to a messy situation where your codebase
is in a half-rewritten, half-broken code, it’s hard to go forward or backwards and sometimes the only
way out is to <code>git checkout</code> and start the refactoring from scratch. This has happened to me a few
times, so I try to be more careful and use the following approach:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Start refactoring something, ideally with a small scope.</li>
    <li>When I find in the process of refactoring that I also need (or want) to refactor something else,
I put the previous refactoring aside by using <code>git stash</code>, and recurse back to step 1.</li>
    <li>I finish the refactoring and create an individual commit. If I have put any previous refactorings
aside before (in step 2), I restore the latest one with <code>git stash pop</code> and go back to step 1.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>With this approach, I always refactor only a single thing, and I don’t have to deal with a broken
codebase, because at the beginning of each refactor I start with a clean slate thanks to <code>git stash</code>.
An additional benefit is that this produces PRs with a lot of small commits that do atomic things,
which makes it easier for reviews (in my experience). <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1435">#1435</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1440">#1440</a> were performed using this strategy.</p>

</details>


<p>After the initial refactoring was completed, I needed to decide how will we actually define the
benchmarks and what tool we should use to gather the execution metrics. Both <code>cargo bench</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs"><code>criterion</code></a> are not a bad choice for running benchmarks, but they only measure wall-time,
while I also wanted to measure hardware counters.
I was considering to use <a href="https://github.com/bheisler/iai"><code>iai</code></a> for a while. However, it uses <a href="https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cg-manual.html">Cachegrind</a>
for the measurements, while I wanted the benchmarks to be executed natively, without simulation.
Also, using Cachegrind wouldn’t produce realistic wall-time results.</p>

<p>In the end, I decided to write a small library called
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/1d1400b66e232cd968c3598cb725c4133cea63a3/collector/benchlib"><code>benchlib</code></a>,
so that we would have ultimate control of defining, executing and measuring the benchmarks, instead
of relying on external crates. <code>benchlib</code> uses Linux <code>perf</code> events to gather hardware metrics, using
the <a href="https://github.com/jimblandy/perf-event"><code>perf-event</code></a> crate. I also took bits and pieces from
other mentioned tools, like the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/collector/benchlib/src/benchmark.rs#L153"><code>black_box</code></a>
function from <code>iai</code>.</p>

<p>The next step that I had to figure out was how would the benchmarks be defined. For compilation time
benchmarks, it’s quite simple — you just point <code>rustc</code> to a crate, which is the benchmark itself,
since we measure compilation time. Initially, I also wanted to create a separate crate for each runtime
benchmark, but I quickly realized that it would take too long to compile (there could be tens or hundreds
of runtime benchmarks eventually), and that it would make contributing to the runtime benchmark suite
more complicated, because you would need to create a whole new crate for each benchmark.</p>

<p>Therefore, I decided to create “benchmark groups”. Each benchmark group is a single crate that defines
a set of runtime benchmarks that share dependencies and that topically belong together. For example,
the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/1d1400b66e232cd968c3598cb725c4133cea63a3/collector/runtime-benchmarks/hashmap/src/main.rs"><code>hashmap</code></a>
benchmark group defines a set of benchmarks related to hash maps. By putting more benchmarks into a
single crate, we can amortize the compilation cost and make sure that related benchmarks use identical
dependencies (e.g. that all the hashmap benchmarks use the same version of
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown"><code>hashbrown</code></a>). It does complicate some things, e.g. you need
to execute the benchmark group first to enumerate the benchmarks contained inside, and it also might
not always be clear into which group should a new benchmark be added. But I think that it is worth it
the reduced compilation time.</p>

<p>Finally, I needed to figure out some way of actually defining the benchmark code. I experimented with
several approaches, e.g. using macros or self-contained functions. In the end, I settled on using
closures, which could access a pre-initialized state for the benchmark from the outside (inspired by
<code>criterion</code>), to avoid re-generating certain inputs for the benchmark repeatedly, thus saving
time<sup id="fnref:cache" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cache" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This is how it currently looks like:</p>

            <span>}</span>
        <span>});</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’m not sure if it’s an ideal way, and so far no one else other than me has added a benchmark to the
suite <img title=":sweat_smile:" alt=":sweat_smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f605.png" height="20" width="20"/> So it’s possible that we will change it later. But for the MVP, it was good enough.</p>

<p>The initial infrastructure for runtime benchmarks, containing a new CLI command added to <code>collector</code>
for executing runtime benchmarks, the <code>benchlib</code> library and two basic benchmarks was added in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1423">#1423</a>. The initial benchmark set contained
a few hashmap benchmars inspired by the <a href="https://martin.ankerl.com/2022/08/27/hashmap-bench-01/">Comprehensive C++ Hashmap Benchmarks 2022</a>
blog post, one benchmark for a past <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/102727">performance regression</a>
and finally an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation">n-body simulation</a>
(added in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1459">#1459</a>).</p>

<p>After the initial PR, I implemented several additional CLI flags, like benchmark filtering or
choosing iteration count (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1453">#1453</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1468">#1468</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1471">#1471</a>),
made the CLI output nicer (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1463">#1463</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1467">#1467</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1477">#1477</a>),
modified <code>benchlib</code> (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1464">#1464</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1465">#1465</a>), added CI support
(<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1461">#1461</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1469">#1469</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1475">#1475</a>),
performed some additional refactoring (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1472">#1472</a>)
and finally implemented storage of the results into a local database
(<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1515">#1515</a>).</p>

<p>After all that (by the beginning of 2023), it was possible to run a simple set of runtime benchmarks
locally using <code>rustc-perf</code>, and store the results into a SQLite database.</p>


<p>Once we were able to measure runtime benchmarks locally, I set out to work on the website integration.
The <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html">perf.RLO website</a> consisted of several indepedent static HTML webpages containing a bunch of
copy-pasted code. Most of the interactive functionality was implemented with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/f95c90bda058768c0ebe0aea5001d018d3194b78/site/static/bootstrap.html#L82">vanilla JavaScript</a>,
and the most complicated page (the compare page, which compares two <code>rustc</code> artifacts) was implemented
in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/f95c90bda058768c0ebe0aea5001d018d3194b78/site/static/compare.html#L304">Vue</a>,
with all the components bundled within a single <code>.html</code> file. In other words, the code had a lot of
technical debt and wasn’t easy to modify.</p>

<p>The website wasn’t changing often<sup id="fnref:changeFrequency" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:changeFrequency" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, so the fact that it wasn’t very maintainable
wasn’t really causing problems. However, I knew that adding runtime benchmarks to the site would
require large changes, which I really didn’t want to make to <em>that</em> codebase. Especially since the
runtime UI would probably reuse a lot of stuff with the compilation time UI, and sharing components
elegantly wasn’t really possible. Therefore, I decided to do the favourite act of all programmers that
have to work with code written by someone else — rewrite it <img title=":laughing:" alt=":laughing:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f606.png" height="20" width="20"/>.</p>

<p>My first plan was to go All in™ and turn the website into a monstrous Single-page application (SPA)
with the help of <code>create-react-app</code> or something like that. However, this plan was met with…
<a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/247081-t-compiler.2Fperformance/topic/perf.2ERLO.20runtime.20UI/near/339674269">some skepticism</a>
<img title=":sweat_smile:" alt=":sweat_smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f605.png" height="20" width="20"/>. Apart from being deployed on perf.RLO, the website is also used by
some developers locally, to test the performance of their local versions of <code>rustc</code> that they hack
on. Before, since the website was just a bunch of static <code>.html</code> and <code>.js</code> pages, it was enough to
execute <code>cargo run</code> and the website would show up. However, if I was to convert it to a full
“modern frontend application”, it would mean that these developers would have to install
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> and use some additional commands to get the website working.</p>

<p>I wasn’t really sure how to resolve this situation. One of the suggestions was to just use modern
ECMAScript supported by the browser to avoid the need for a Javascript/Node.js-based build system. I
explored this option, and I was pleasantly surprised at what can be nowadays supported in browsers
natively<sup id="fnref:nativeWeb" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nativeWeb" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. However, one of my main use-cases was to support sharing of components, and
that still wasn’t trivial without a build system. I have looked at web components, which actually
looked quite nice, until I realized that I couldn’t pass arbitrary JS expressions as component props
(all props were basically stringified), which has reduced their appeal to me significantly.
Furthermore, I really wanted to use TypeScript, because I knew that I wanted to refactor a non-trivial
amount of code in a codebase without any tests, and types could really help with that<sup id="fnref:typePhobia" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:typePhobia" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.
And using TypeScript basically means having to use some kind of build system.</p>

<p>I even considered to use some Rust frontend framework, like <a href="https://yew.rs/">Yew</a> or
<a href="https://dioxuslabs.com/">Dioxus</a>. However, it would mean that I would have to rewrite the considerable
amount of UI code already present in the web, which would be cumbersome. And I also didn’t feel like
experimenting with (still heavily) evolving frameworks in this project, to avoid rewriting the UI again
in a year.</p>


<p>To avoid making large disruptive changes outright, I decided to start with something smaller, and get
rid of some of the duplication in the HTML pages by using some basic server-side template rendering.
I started with the <a href="https://github.com/djc/askama">askama</a> template engine, however after
experimenting with it, I realized that it’s not a good fit for website development, because it cannot
rebuild the templates <a href="https://github.com/djc/askama/issues/273">on the fly</a>. This means that everytime
I (or someone else) wanted to make some changes to the website frontend, the website binary would
have to be rebuilt, which is very far from an interactive experience. I thus decided to go with
the <a href="https://github.com/Keats/tera">tera</a> crate instead, which allows re-rendering templates from the filesystem
while the program (in our case the website) is running. To make it more efficient, I implemented a
scheme where in debug mode, the website reloads templates from the disk (so that development iteration
is quick), and in release mode the templates are loaded just once and then cached forever (so that the
website is more efficient). This was implemented in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1539">#1539</a>, where the simplest page (help page)
was ported to the template engine. This was later extended to the rest of the website’s pages in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1542">#1542</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1543">#1543</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1545">#1545</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1548">#1548</a>.</p>

<p>This was a good start, as it allowed us to get rid of some duplication and clean up the HTML pages a bit.
However, it didn’t really solve my problem with reusing components and using TypeScript, of course.
After thinking about it a bit more, I decided that introducing a build system is the only solution
that would satisfy my needs, and that could hopefully also attract more frontend contributors
to the <code>rustc-perf</code> project<sup id="fnref:newContributors" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:newContributors" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. But what about the developers that wanted to avoid
<code>npm</code>? Well, I remembed the ancient adage: <code>If the developer won&#39;t come to npm, then npm must go to
the developer</code>. In other words, I needed to provide the website to <code>rustc</code> developers without
requiring them to install <code>npm</code> themselves.</p>

<p>I took inspiration from <code>rustc</code> itself and decided to implement nightly builds of <code>rustc-perf</code>. These
would be compiled every day on CI and published as GitHub releases, which developers could simply
download and use locally, without having to build it themselves. Since most of the developers don’t
ever change the website code, and they just want to use it, this seemed like an ideal solution. One
annoyance with this was that the website binary was loading templates and other static files (<code>.js</code>,
<code>.css</code> etc.) from the disk, so distributing the website meant sharing a whole archive of files. If
only there was some way of embedding these files into the binary itself… Turns out, there is! I found
the awesome <a href="https://github.com/pyrossh/rust-embed">rust-embed</a> crate, using which you can embed pretty much any file directly into
your Rust binary, and then load it during runtime from the binary (or rather from some data segment
in memory) itself. I implemented this embedding in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1554">#1554</a>
(and later extended in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1605">#1605</a> to embed
some additional data), and then added a CI workflow for nightly builds in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1555">#1555</a>. With these
changes in place, I got the green light to finally add <code>npm</code> to the project <img title=":smiling_imp:" alt=":smiling_imp:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f608.png" height="20" width="20"/>.</p>


<p>Now that I could finally add a build system, I had just a single, <em>tiny</em> problem - actually choosing
which build system to use. If you know anything about the “modern JavaScript ecosystem”, you know
that this problem is as easy as combining aliasing with mutability in Rust — it’s not very easy at all.
Webpack, Parcel, Vite, Rollup, Esbuild, Snowpack, bun, oh my… I started by listing some requirements
that I would have for the build system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The website already contained some Vue code, and I wanted to use TypeScript, so it should support
both, and also their combination! I also wanted support both for Vue Single-file components (SFC),
and for embedding JSX components within the Vue SFC files.</li>
  <li>Other developers have expressed a desire (which I share) to have the build system be “zero config”,
to avoid maintaining hundreds of lines of configuration files (looking at you, Webpack).</li>
  <li>It would have to support a “multi-page application” (MPA) mode. I didn’t want to turn the web into
a full-fledged SPA. Instead, I wanted to bundle each page as a separate self-contained mini-application,
while still having the option to share code, styles and components between the individual pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>After trying to create a simple project in several of the mentioned build systems, I decided to go
with <a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</a>. It is near zero config, supports the MPA use case relatively
well and all the mentioned Vue and TypeScript wizardry was working in it out of the box. Apart from
one issue<sup id="fnref:parcelProblem" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:parcelProblem" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, it has worked fine, and I have been satisfied with the choice so far.</p>

<p>The new build system was implemented in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1565">#1565</a>
<sup id="fnref:npmDiff" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:npmDiff" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. After that, I have ported the rest of the pages to the new system, adding types where
possible, refactoring and cleaning up the code, and completely restructuring the Vue implementation
of the compare page to make it easier to understand and modify
(<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1570">#1570</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1573">#1573</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1577">#1577</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1581">#1581</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1590">#1590</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1573">#1573</a>). After that, I added some additional
CI infrastructure (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1594">#1594</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1601">#1601</a>), updated documentation to match the new
frontend build system (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1588">#1588</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1596">#1596</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1603">#1603</a>) and fixed some regressions introduced by
the rewrite (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1583">#1583</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1593">#1593</a>).</p>

<p>This whole ordeal took several months by the way, which was one of the reasons why it took me so long
to implement the MVP of runtime benchmarks. Sometimes refactoring of old code is more time-consuming
than writing the new code :)</p>


<p>After the frontend was finally in a reasonable state, I started working on adding support for
visualizing the results of runtime benchmarks. First, this required some non-trivial changes to DB
querying in the site’s backend, so that we could query compilation time and runtime results in a
unified way (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1608">#1608</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1610">#1610</a>). After that, I generalized the UI of the
compare page, so that we could show more structured information on the page, by adding tabs in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1612">#1612</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://kobzol.github.io/assets/posts/runtime-benchmarks/compare-ui-tab.png" alt="Screenshot of the perf.RLO compare page, showing newly added tabs"/></p>

<p>and then finally added a new runtime benchmarks tab with a simple table that shows their measured
results in the comapre page in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1620">#1620</a>. I slightly extended this table with
filters in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1650">#1650</a>, however the interface is still
quite basic and runtime benchmarks are also not yet integrated into the other pages, like the
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/dashboard.html">dashboard</a> or into <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/index.html">graphs</a>
(contributions are welcome, as always :) ).</p>


<p>At this point, we were able to execute runtime benchmarks, store their results into the database
and display the results on the website. The last missing piece for the MVP was to actually run
the benchmarks on the
<a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/rustc/2023/08/18/rustc-benchmark-suite.html#how-is-the-benchmark-suite-executed">benchmarking machine</a>
after every master commit.</p>

<p>First, in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1630">#1630</a> I implemented support for
executing runtime benchmarks for published artifacts (stable and beta) releases. These are benchmarked
sporadically, so I wanted to start with them to make sure that everything is working, before enabling
runtime benchmarks for all commits. Turns out that everything was not, in fact, working, so I had to
perform some additional refactorings and fixes, both to runtime benchmarks and also to the benchmarking
of the stable artifacts themselves (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1629">#1629</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1636">#1636</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1637">#1637</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1641">#1641</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1642">#1642</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1651">#1651</a>).</p>

<p>After that work was done, we finally flipped the switch to execute runtime benchmarks by default
on each master commit and try build in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1662">#1662</a>
<img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"/>. It’s a satisfying feeling to merge a ~20 line PR that enables something that you have been
preparing for almost a year :) The original issue <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/69">#69</a>,
which asked for runtime benchmarks to be added to <code>rustc-perf</code>, was thus closed after mere…
<em>checks notes</em> 7 years :)</p>


<p>In parallel with refactoring the web and integrating the benchmarks into our CI, I have also been
adding new runtime benchmarks. I tried to take inspiration from several sources, mostly from
<a href="https://github.com/anp/lolbench">lolbench</a> (the original runtime benchmark suite) and also from some
benchmarks mentioned by Niko Matsakis in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/69">original issue</a>.
Here is a list of benchmarks that I have added to the suite. Note that some of them might be overlapping,
or just not very good at all.</p>

<p><strong>Building the suite is still a work in progress, and if you have interesting benchmark candidates,
I would like to hear about them! :)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Regex (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1639">#1639</a>): benchmarks matching of two
simple regular expressions using the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex">regex</a> crate.</li>
  <li>Raytracer (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1640">#1640</a>): benchmarks a
<a href="https://github.com/jorendorff/rust-raytrace">raytracer</a> that renders a simple scene. This is probably
currently my favourite benchmark, because it measures an actual (and useful) Rust program, rather than
just an artificial usage of some crate.</li>
  <li>Brotli (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1645">#1645</a>): benchmarks
compression and decompression of ~10 MiB of text<sup id="fnref:holmes" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:holmes" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> with the Brotli compression algorithm
using the <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/rust-brotli"><code>brotli</code></a> crate.</li>
  <li>nom (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1646">#1646</a>): benchmarks parsing of JSON using
the parser-combinator framework <a href="https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom">nom</a>.</li>
  <li>fmt (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1653">#1653</a>): benchmarks the performance of
the <code>std::fmt</code> formatting machinery, by formatting a struct with that uses <code>#[derive(Debug)]</code> and
by using the <code>write!</code> macro to write into a <code>String</code> buffer. This benchmark is sadly just a stub,
and it should be eventually extended with many more formatting use-cases. The formatting machinery
is currently undergoing a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/99012">major rewrite</a> and I hope
that this group of benchmarks will eventually serve as a guideline to test its performance effects on
real Rust programs.</li>
  <li>CSS parsing (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1655">#1655</a>): benchmarks the parsing of
a 5 MiB CSS file that I copy-pasted from the Facebook website. The parsing is performed using the
<a href="https://github.com/parcel-bundler/lightningcss">lightningcss</a> crate, which is used by Parcel to
parse and minify CSS.</li>
  <li>SVG parsing and rendering (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1656">#1656</a>): benchmarks
parsing of a ~30 MiB SVG file from <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/PrimeraFaseCentroExpedici%C3%B3nAlNorte.svg">Wikipedia</a>,
and also its rendering into a <code>1024x1024</code> bitmap image. Both operations use the <a href="https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg">resvg</a>
crate.</li>
</ul>

<p>During the course of implementing these benchmarks, I also performed some additional changes and
refactorings to the runtime benchmark machinery
(<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1604">#1604</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1638">#1638</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1644">#1644</a>), apart from other things to make it
easier to define the benchmarks.</p>


<p>After the MVP was merged, we had a set of runtime benchmarks that were being executed on each master
commit. However, when the first regression has appeared, I realized that we don’t have any tooling to
help us diagnose what is going on, and whether the regression is just noise or not. For compilation
time benchmarks, we have a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/collector#profiling-local-builds">wide range</a>
of tools for profiling the compiler, but for runtime benchmarks we had none. To fix this, I implemented
two separate commands to help us profile runtime benchmarks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cachegrind diff (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1695">#1695</a>).
<a href="https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cg-manual.html">Cachegrind</a> is a very useful tool for profiling programs,
and specifically also for comparing the execution traces of two slightly different versions of the
same program, to find out in what functions did they spend the most time (or rather executed the most
instructions). We already use it extensively to compare diffs of compilation time benchmarks compiled
by two versions of <code>rustc</code>. In the linked PR, I generalized its usage so that we could also compare
two executions of a runtime benchmark compiled with two versions of <code>rustc</code>.</p>

    <p>One complication that I found is that for compilation benchmarks, we want to measure the whole
  compilation using Cachegrind. However, for runtime benchmarks, we ideally only want to measure
  the part of the program where the actual benchmark is executed, and not the whole “benchmark
  library ceremony” around it. Valgrind has support for <a href="https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core-adv.html#manual-core-adv.clientreq">client requests</a>,
  which allow the profiled program (amongst other things) to selectively enable and disable
  instrumentation for parts of the program. It was implemented for <a href="https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core-adv.html#manual-core-adv.clientreq">Callgrind</a>,
  and there is even a nice crate called <a href="https://github.com/2dav/crabgrind">crabgrind</a> that
  allows using the requests from Rust code. However, I found out that the requests were not implemented
  for Cachegrind. Luckily, one of my colleagues from the
  <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler#Compiler%20performance%20working%20group">Compiler performance working group</a>
  is none other than <a href="https://github.com/nnethercote">Nicholas Nethercote</a>, the author of Cachegrind
  <img title=":laughing:" alt=":laughing:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f606.png" height="20" width="20"/>! I asked him about this, and he was kind enough to implement support for client
  requests into Cachegrind to support our use-case. I then added support for these requests into
  crabgrind in this <a href="https://github.com/2dav/crabgrind/pull/1">PR</a>. The requests are not yet actually
  used by our runtime benchmark library, but I have a branch with it and plan to send a PR to <code>rustc-perf</code>
  soon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Codegen diff (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1697">#1697</a>). I was thinking about what
other information could be useful to us to find out the source of a regression. Sometimes, it can be
interesting to look at the differences in the generated code, so I created a “codegen diff” command,
which compares assembly, LLVM IR or MIR for all functions of a given benchmark compiled by two versions
of <code>rustc</code>. It uses the great <a href="https://github.com/pacak/cargo-show-asm">cargo-show-asm</a> cargo subcommand
for getting the actual codegen contents. The diff is printed to stdout in a simple way, so it’s nowhere
near as nice as e.g. <a href="https://godbolt.org">Compiler explorer</a>. Nevertheless, I think that it can be
quite useful for investigating regressions.</p>

    <p>After using the codegen diff to investigate an <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/115129#issuecomment-1722448493">actual regression</a>,
I realized that it would be also nice to see the difference in sizes of the individual functions. If
the same function suddenly becomes much larger, it can hint to an unexpected codegen regression.
I implemented that in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1721">#1721</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>


<p>As I stated before, the implemented version of runtime benchmarks is an MVP, which works, but also
lacks many things. Runtime benchmarks should be integrated into the other pages of the website,
their UI in the compare page should be extended, e.g. with guides on how to run codegen or cachegrind
diff locally, more tools for analyzing the performance of the benchmarks could be added, and perhaps
most importantly, the runtime benchmark suite itself should be improved and extended. As always, there
is a lot of stuff to do :)</p>


<p>If you have any comments or questions about the runtime benchmarks, or you want to suggest your
own benchmarks to be added to the suite, let me know on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/rust/s/rt6P4xLcSf">Reddit</a> or send a PR to
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf"><code>rustc-perf</code></a>.</p>
