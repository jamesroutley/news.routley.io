    <h1>Japanese scientists develop artificial blood compatible with all blood types</h1>

    <p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>A critical </span><span>component</span><span> of healthcare, blood transfusions play a vital role in saving lives around the globe every day. Maintaining an adequate blood supply, though, is no easy task, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The demand for O</span><span>–</span><span>negative blood — the universal donor type — often exceeds supply and donations have a limited shelf life. Looking to address the issue are a group of Japanese scientists led by Hiromi Sakai at <a href="https://www.naramed-u.ac.jp/university/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nara Medical University</a>. </span><span>They’ve</span><span> developed a new type of artificial blood that can be used in patients of any blood type. </span></span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>The artificial blood is created by extracting hemoglobin — a protein </span><span>containing</span><span> iron that </span><span>facilitates</span><span> the transportation of oxygen in red blood cells — from expired donor blood. It is then encased in a protective shell to create stable, virus-free artificial red blood cells. As these artificial cells have no blood type, there is no need for compatibility testing. The synthetic blood can </span><span>reportedly be</span><span> stored for up to two years at room temperature and five years under refrigeration. That is a significant improvement over donated red blood cells, which can only be stored under refrigeration for a maximum of </span><span>42 days</span><span>. </span></span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2 id="683d47927a6cd"><span data-contrast="auto">Artificial Blood Trials </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Small-scale studies began in 2022. Three groups of four healthy male volunteers aged 20 to 50 received a single intravenous injection of hemoglobin vesicles — artificial oxygen carriers that mimic the structure of red blood cells — in increasing amounts, up to 100 milliliters. While some participants experienced mild side effects, there were no significant changes in vital signs, including blood pressure. Building on that success, Sakai announced that his team was accelerating the process last July. In March, it started administering between 100 and 400 milliliters of the artificial blood cell solution to volunteers. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>If no side effects are confirmed, the trial will shift to examin</span><span>ing</span><span> the treatment’s efficacy and safety. It aims to put the artificial red blood cells into practical use by around 2030. While these studies are taking place, Professor Teruyuki Komatsu of Chuo University’s Faculty of Science and Engineering is also working on the development of artificial oxygen carriers, using albumin-encased hemoglobin to stabilize blood pressure and treat conditions like hemorrhage and stroke. So far, animal studies have shown promising results. As a result, researchers are now eager to move to human trials.</span></span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
