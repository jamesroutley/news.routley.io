      </div><div><p>It’s here! A couple of months ago, <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/ferrocene-language-specification/">we announced</a> that as part of
our efforts with Ferrocene, we were creating the Ferrocene Language
Specification – and now <a href="https://spec.ferrocene.dev">our first draft is online</a>.</p>

<p>The Ferrocene Language Specification (FLS) is an effort of
<a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/ferrocene/">Ferrocene</a>, a collaboration between Ferrous Systems and AdaCore to
bring a qualified Rust toolchain to safety-critical environments. One of the
requirements for qualifying such a toolchain is to describe how the compiler
should behave when compiling source code, which means a specification of the
programming language.</p>

<p>The FLS is <a href="https://github.com/ferrocene/specification">available on GitHub</a> and has been released under an open source
license.</p>

<p>The FLS is not here to replace Rust’s decision-making process and it’s not a
canonical definition of the Rust language. We’re documenting the current
behavior of the rustc compiler in a standardized form so that it can be
qualified. If there is a mismatch between what the FLS says and how the
compiler behaves, the specification will be updated.</p>

<p>On that note, we want to emphasize this is a first draft and we are aware that
there are some parts of the specification that are incomplete or incorrect.
We’re going to keep improving the FLS in the open, with the plan of finalizing
it by the end of the year.</p>

<p>We at Ferrous Systems and AdaCore are on-track to get Ferrocene
qualification-ready by the end of the year. As this is our focus for the near
future, the small group of people working on Ferrocene might not be able to
accept all contributions to the FLS coming from the community. Check out our
<a href="https://github.com/ferrocene/specification/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst">contribution guidelines</a> for more information on that.</p>

<p>While we created this document for Ferrocene, we know there is interest in this
project and we believe a document like the FLS can benefit the wider Rust
community.</p>

<p>Thanks for your interest! If you or your teams are currently investigating this
kind of specification effort, reach out to us at
