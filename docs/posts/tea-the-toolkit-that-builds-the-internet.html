          Like its predecessor, <code>brew</code>,
            <span>tea</span> is the base of the
            developer stack—seated beneath the tools that build the Internet.
          We’re uniquely placed to have tangible impact on all aspects of software development
            <i>and we intend to</i>.
          We will make sure devs have the tools they need to build the Internet and
            the compensation they need to keep on building.

          <span>It’s time for an</span> revolution.
        </h2>
        <p>
          For more than twenty years the Internet has been built upon the fruits of freely available open source.
          Whenever a project enabled new functionality it was
            (whether desired or not)
            added as a new brick in the tower of infrastructure;
            giving the Internet new powers and capabilities;
            becoming a new foundation for all the innovations that followed.
          The maintainers of these new bricks became thanklessly unpaid volunteers.
        </p>
        <h3><span>The</span> Homebrew <span>Story</span>.</h3>
        <p>
          Homebrew has been used by tens of millions of creators to build things we all use every day,
            and yet Max Howell—the creator of <code>brew</code> and co‐founder of <span>tea</span>—was
            unable to make a living from Homebrew alone.
          Maintaining such a large project was more than a full‐time job but every few years Max
            would have to go back to working on somebody else’s idea for money.
          Of the countless enterprises that have utilized Homebrew,
            only two have ever said thanks:
          Google sent him a blanket and Square sent him an iPad.
          As generous as (the iPad) was, small gifts don’t pay bills.
          We’re making sure such a thing never happens again and that open source developers
            can focus on building things they love without compromise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://medium.com/teaxyz/tea-brew-478a9e736638">Max tells the story himself at Medium →</a>
        </p>
        <h3><span>Tech giants accrued fortunes on the backs of people they’ve</span> never thanked, paid or even met.</h3>
        <p>
          The problem has always existed, but the technology to solve it hasn’t.
          <span>tea</span> facilitates the graph of open source that underpins all modern digital infrastructure.
          We’re putting it <i>on‐chain</i> creating a <i>map</i>
            we’ll use to guide value redistribution to the open source that makes the Internet possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re not changing how open source works—<i>it’s still free.</i>
          web3 has introduced powerful new paradigms that allow value to be compensated without direct payment.
          Creator economy, meet open source.

          Wherever you develop,

            however you deploy your app,
            <span>tea</span> is there.
          We abstract this detail away so you can get on with the work that matters to <strong>you</strong>.

          Your <code>README</code>, blog post or internal install instructions can
          all use the same, simple one‐liner.

        <p><code>
          <span>$</span> sh &lt;(curl tea.xyz) install deno.land

          Here, our one‐liner installs <a href="https://deno.land"><code>deno</code></a>
            to <code>./bin/deno</code>. If <span>tea</span> is installed it
            integrates with that installation, if not the script just exits;
            <span>tea</span> itself is not installed either way.
          We’re happy to be just the transmission layer.

          <span>Decentralized</span> Secure.
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span>tea</span>’s decentralization offers tangible benefits to ecosystem <b>security<span>.</span></b>
          Every layer of your apps and dapps is signed and verified on‐chain.
          Users can rest assured that the software they are using is what <i>all</i> its creators intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          In day to day development our decentralization increases <b>reliability</b>
          (<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/">leftpad</a> is a sore memory)
          and gives developers the flexibility they need to turn inspiration into empires;
          when a single proprietry vendor controls how your stack is composed and deployed your stack is centralized and <strong>under their control</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re also saying goodbye to centralization at the <i>installation layer</i>.
          Say hello to native, built‐in “version management”† for every tool in your stack
          and goodbye to dependency hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          † similar to tools like <code>rbenv</code>, <code>nvm</code> or Python’s virtualenv.

          <span>tea</span> is built with a “it just works” philosophy.
          It’s our job to set you up for success and then get out of your way so you can work as effectively as possible.
          Development is hard enough without the toolset being a source of pain as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much like its predecessor, <code>brew</code>, <span>tea</span> is full of delightful touches.
          You’ll have to try it and see.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>ofc delightful also means <b>fast<span>.</span></b></i> You’ve got plenty to do and need tools that <i>respect your time</i>.
