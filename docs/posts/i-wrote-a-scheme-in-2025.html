<p>One year minus one week ago to the day I <a href="https://maplant.com/2025-02-17-Why-I%27m-Writing-a-Scheme-Implementation-in-2025-%28The-Answer-is-Async-Rust%29.html">published an article</a>
announcing the new Scheme implementation I was writing, <a href="https://scheme-rs.org">scheme-rs</a>.
Today I am excited to announce that <code>scheme-rs</code> has reached its first version,
<code>0.1.0</code>. You can check it out at it’s website (<code>scheme-rs.org</code>, which should be
updated to <code>scheme.rs</code> at some point when DNS propagation finishes) or its
<a href="https://github.com/maplant/scheme-rs">github page</a>.</p>
<p>Although there’s much more work to do (and I will talk about that further down
the page), after reaching the milestone of completing <code>2258</code> tests in the R6RS
test suite, I’ve decided that <code>scheme-rs</code> is stable enough to commit to a first
release.</p>
<p>It’s been a pretty amazing journey, one that I’m excited to continue on.</p>
<h2>Changes since I initially announced scheme-rs last year:</h2>
<p>There have been some changes since I initially announced scheme-rs. The biggest
is that it is no longer exclusively async, and now supports sync as well.</p>
<p>This change was inevitable; only supporting async would really hamper adoption
(or more importantly my personal use cases for the project). But I’m really
happy that I was able to implement this change without hamstringing async
support at all. In fact, it is even possible to use scheme-rs in both async and
sync contexts.</p>
<h2>Things that are not finished</h2>
<p>There are quite a few things that are not quite complete, and I will list them
here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The garbage collector has quite a bit of room for improvement.</li>
<li>Performance in general is Ok but could be made much better.</li>
<li>There are a lot of missing procedures and syntax from R6RS but also just in
general, for example I’d really like to add pattern matching.</li>
<li>There’s always more documentation that can be added.</li>
<li>Debugging could be greatly improved.</li>
</ul>
<p>But more importantly, I’m very excited to start working on the new language I am
building on top of <code>scheme-rs</code>. I mentioned that it would be strongly typed, but
now I think I might want to use calculus of construction. The possibilities are
truly endless!</p>
<h2>An aside on how scheme-rs came to be:</h2>
<p>In August of last year I had just lost my job. I wasn’t sure exactly what to do.
I looked out on the landscape of software engineering jobs and became
increasingly uncertain of my place in it. I had been unsatisfied with work for a
number of years at that point, and it felt like I had lost the differentiating
factor that made me worth hiring in the first place. The idea of getting a job
that was interesting, one that challenged me, seemed to be completely out of
reach.</p>
<p>I decided that what I would do is look inward. I would try to rediscover where
my original love for computer science came from. I had this dinky little project
that I had been working on and off on for a while with no clear vision. I
decided that I would spend my free time dedicated to that project. I would do
research and focus on doing things correctly and with a strong backing from
academics. I’d apply for a few jobs, but if those fell through I’d apply for
grad school instead.</p>
<p>I’d buy a printer and read papers.</p>

Appel, Advanced Language Implementation edited by Peter Lee, Revised [6] Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme edited by Michael Sperber, R. Kent Dybvig Matthew Flatt and Anton van Straten) and four papers: Effective Nondestructive Equality Checking for Trees and Graphs, Concurrent Cycle collection in Reference Counted Systems, Extending the Scope fo Syntactic Abstractions, and Implicit Phasing for R6RS Libraries"/>
<p>That dinky little project was <code>scheme-rs</code>, and it’s hard to describe just how
much it changed my life. I feel much more confident in my ability as a software
engineer. I no longer think that a PhD is something that is meant for people
much smarter than me. And more miraculously it directly lead me to finding a job
that I absolutely love.</p>
<p><code>scheme-rs</code> is not particularly special in this regard. It was simply something
that challenged me. And if you have a brain at all like mine, I highly
recommend you find a project that challenges you like <code>scheme-rs</code> challenged me.</p>
