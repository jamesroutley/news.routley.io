    <h1>I won&#39;t be renewing my Pinboard subscription</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-8877579624898161617" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>In the years following the Great Recession, from 2010 to 2013, <a href="https://notes.kateva.org/2013/04/the-net-is-forest-it-has-fires.html">many web services went offline</a>. In retrospect that was the end of the Berners-Lee web.</p><p>During that time, starting in 12/29/2011, I started using Maciej Cegłowski&#39;s <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> bookmarking site as a kind of micro blog. </p><p>Pinboard filled part of the Google Reader Social vacuum. There were various apps and services around pinboard, in addition to IFTTT, that made that feasible. My <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:jgordon/t:s">Pinboard &#39;s&#39; posts</a> were published to Twitter, then app.net, and <a href="https://tech.kateva.org/2023/01/using-ifttt-webhook-to-post-rss-feed.html">most recently Mastodon</a> (and probably a few other services too). They were also archived in <a href="http://kateva.org/sh">kateva.org/sh</a>. </p><p>Pinboard imported my old Google Reader social bookmarks so it&#39;s a pretty complete set of things I shared, mostly tech and events that seemed to have potential lasting meaning. There are over 50,000 pins now. There were apps written for Pinboard, creating a small ecosystem of added value.</p><p>I&#39;m still on my original subscription plan - about $20 a year or so. It ends in Feb 2025 and I won&#39;t be renewing. I feel like it&#39;s 2013 again.</p><p>Over the past few years there have been a slowly increasing number of pinboard outages with less communication. While debugging the last outage I purged my local history from the 3rd party Pins iOS app and found that Pinboard was throttling their download API. I could download only 100 of my 50,000 or so pins. (It&#39;s still easy to download the whole set as a file). </p><p>That&#39;s ominous, but more importantly Pinboard is a one person show and that person is no longer responding to support emails. Maciej is no longer active on social media that I know of. His Pinboard.in support forum has been quiescent for years. I&#39;ll be researching my micro blog options and I&#39;ll write about what I come up with on tech.kateva.org. </p><p>10 years is an eternity on the web. Pinboard had a good run, but it too is passing. I have my archives and you can still download JSON or HTM versions of past bookmarks. I might wish for a more graceful end but Pinboard was a good service while it lasted and there is a clear data exit if not a clear replacement. Thank you, Maciej, for the value you delivered to me.</p>
