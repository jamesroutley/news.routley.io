    <h1>Feedbase is an Atom/RSS-feed to nntp gateway</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><h2>What is it?</h2><p>Feedbase is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)">Atom</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>-feed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol">nntp</a> gateway.</p><p>What this means is that Feedbase regularly fetches Atom/RSS-feeds and exposes the items using the nntp protocol, allowing you to follow the feeds using a news reader.</p><p>This is quite convenient in a number of ways:</p><ul><li>Unified interface to all the feeds you care about</li><li>Only see items that are aggregated into multiple planets once (crossposting)</li><li>Skip uninteresting items with newsreader scoring/killfiles</li><li>See updates to items (Supersedes: with <del>differences</del> <ins>changes</ins> highlighted)</li></ul><h2>Motivation</h2><p>I have been using a very similar service, <a href="http://gwene.org/">Gwene</a>, since it was created.</p><p>Gwene has a couple of drawbacks: items with content in XHTML get horribly mangled - compare <a href="http://feedbase.org/image/gwene1.png">Gwene&#39;s</a> <a href="http://feedbase.org/image/gwene2.png">display</a> of this item to <a href="http://feedbase.org/image/feedbase1.png">Feedbase&#39;s</a> <a href="http://feedbase.org/image/feedbase2.png">display.</a>(I tried to fix this, but the underlying library used, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::FeedPP">XML::FeedPP</a>, is too complicated for me to comprehend, and when I contacted the author his reply was that it can&#39;t be fixed).</p><p>The other drawback is that Gwene never grew the <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.discuss/15120/focus=15939">ability to allow comments</a>, it is read-only. I would like to make it possible to discuss, locally, the various items in the feeds. On Feedbase, you can.</p><p>Another problem is that items have a tendency to be aggregated into multiple feeds (planets), and if you follow a couple of them, you see the same item many times. Feedbase detects this and uses crossposting to allow you to skip the article easily when you encounter it multiple times.</p><p>Finally people tend to update their posts, and while Gwene ignores this, Feedbase uses the nntp supersede functionality to present the <del>correct</del> <ins>updated</ins> article to the reader.</p></div>
