    <h1>Show HN: A unique generated maze to share with your valentine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
        Lost in Love is a project by <a href="https://berk.es">BÃ¨r Kessels</a> to create and share a unique maze for you and your love. </p><div>
        <dt>What is it?</dt>

            <strong>Lost in Love</strong> is an art project. It is so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art">generative art</a>: I write the software, and the software creates art autonomously. </p>

        <dt>What inspired you?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
          In a gallery in London, I came across gorgeaus screenprints by <a href="https://rbyrneart.com/">Ricky Byrne</a>. I loved their use of color and hand-produced feel. Attention for color, layout, tension.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>How does it work?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
          The names you provide are used to generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed ">unique randomnes</a>. 
          This is used in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm">maze generation algorithm</a> to create a maze. </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Saving, copying and sharing doesn&#39;t work</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
          Saving, copying and sharing the maze is disabled until the maze is generated. Once the maze is generated, you can save, copy and share the maze. </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Can I customize the maze?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            <strong>No</strong>, the only parameter you can provide is the names. The maze is generated based on these names, and the algorithm is fixed. This is by design. Only the two names determine the artwork. </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Where is the code?
        </dt><dd>
          <p>
            The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/berkes/art/tree/main/lost-in-love">GitHub</a>. Feel free to fork, change and improve it, or just have fun with it. <br/>
