  <p>Was supposed to give a talk and workshop on <strong>Interfaces for Data Consent</strong> at the <a href="https://recapworkshop.online" target="_blank"><strong>Re-Imagining Cryptography and Privacy (ReCAP) Workshop</strong></a> last month! Sadly came down with a virus and was unable to attend. I did compile some resources into a short guide that I’d like to share.</p><p>—</p><p>“<strong>How can clear, effective, and fluid interfaces for consent be built into digital public infrastructure and data governance?</strong></p><p>Some examples of cultural frameworks and interfaces for consent include: Betty Martin’s Wheel of Consent; informed consent in medicine; University Title IX Policies of Affirmative Consent; Sociocracy’s “Consent Decision-Making”; consensus decision making; opt-in vs. opt-out; consent profiles; GDPR cookie consent interfaces; Creative Commons licensing; open-source licensing, GPL3, and copyleft; and more!</p><p>As we translate cultural frameworks for consent into interactable consent interfaces, how can we implement privacy and cryptography tools to provide backend <strong>consent guarantees</strong>?”</p>
