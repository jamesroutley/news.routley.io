    <h1>Show HN: I built an Obsidian plugin to create notes from BibTeX</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vishnubharathi.codes/akopdev/obsidian-bibtex-manager/blob/master/cover.png"><img src="https://vishnubharathi.codes/akopdev/obsidian-bibtex-manager/raw/master/cover.png" alt="Create New Note in Obsidian BibteX Manager"/></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Obsidian plug-in that simplifies the process of managing academic references by enabling the creation of literature notes from a BibTeX entry,
displaying formatted reference lists, and generating citations instantly.</p>
<p dir="auto">This plug-in operates seamlessly on both desktop and mobile platforms, and does not require external dependencies.</p>

<p dir="auto">For each reference in Obsidian I create a dedicated literature note that contains meta information about the source of citation. BibTeX is a common way to store references in academic writing, that is why I decided to create a plug-in that would allow me to easily create literature notes just by copy and pasting the BibTeX entry.</p>
<p dir="auto">The plug-in also supports automatic formatting of reference lists within the note, while keeping the original BibTeX entry unmodified. I use this feature to keep source BibTeX file unmodified, while having a nicely formatted reference list in the note.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike other plug-ins, I support mobile platform as a &#34;first-class citizen&#34;, meaning there are no dependencies on external services or desktop-only features.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can add BibTeX entries from Zotero, Mendeley, or any other popular reference managers, as well as rely on custom BibTeX implementation.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Generate literature notes from BibTeX entries using customizable templates.</li>
<li>Automatically format your BibTeX entries as a reference list, creating a well-organized bibliography within your notes.</li>
<li>Insert citations directly into your notes.</li>
</ul>

<ol dir="auto">
<li>Open Obsidian Settings.</li>
<li>In the side menu, select Community plugins.</li>
<li>Select Browse and put &#34;Obsidian BibTeX Manager&#34; into search box.</li>
<li>Select Install.</li>
<li>Go to plugin settings and setup path to custom templates.</li>
</ol>
