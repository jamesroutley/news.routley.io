<p>And now for something completely different. </p>



<p>Meanwhile Suno 4.5 happened, and I’m totally blown away by it!</p>











<p>Computer-generated music has fascinated me since my youth. I even wrote my master thesis at ETH Zurich on AI and music. But Suno is in a completely different league to all previous attempts (and there have been many). So it’s high time I played around with it. This technology definitely has a high addiction potential!</p>



<p>In this post, I explore Suno’s ability to create covers of existing songs – my songs, of course. As before, the songs are available under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ch/">Creative Commons by-nc-sa</a>. Since algorithmically generated works are not copyrightable in almost all countries, I am taking the liberty of making the covers generated by Suno available here as well.</p>



<p>This post even made it onto the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2025-05-11">front page of Hacker News</a>!</p>



<h3>Generating from direct live recording</h3>



<p>Let’s start with the original track which I composed and recorded in last November (all instruments are played live by me simultaneously, without overdups): <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/2024-02/2024-11-25.0.mp3">2024-11-25/1</a> (from <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/?p=1317">this album</a>).</p>



<p>And here the first cover generated by Suno; as style I entered “prog jazz rock”; the result is pretty close to the original – just incredible how this algorithm works – like magic: <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/2024-11-25.0_suno_prog_jazz_rock.mp3">2024-11-25/1 Jazz Rock</a></p>



<p>For the second attempt I was more currageous and added a brass section with a sax solo, still in jazz rock style: <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/2024-11-25.0_suno_prog_jazz_rock_brass_section_sax_solo.mp3">2024-11-25/1 Jazz Rock Brass Section</a>. The result is just great and very groovy, even with a jazz guitar solo in the middle, and I like how the theme kicks in at the end.</p>



<p>And since my wive is very fond of the various house tracks she found on Suno, here a version in a combined jazz rock house style, still with brass, and some electronics in the middle: <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/2024-11-25.0_suno_dito_with_house_funk_african_brass_remastered.mp3">2024-11-25/1 Jazz Rock House Funk</a>. No one can keep still with this groove. Unfortunately the track just ends abruptly.</p>



<p>And last but not least, a rap version with lyrics about computers and music, put together for me by Perplexity; it has different parts and breaks and a great sax solo at the end: <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/2024-11-25.0_suno_dito_with_rap_remastered.mp3">2024-11-25/1 Jazz Rock House Funk Rap</a>. Now if that isn’t a hit!</p>



<h3>Generating from direct sequencer mixdown</h3>



<p>Here are some tracks from my <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/?p=261">ToyLand album</a>, which I regenerated with Suno:</p>



<p>Let’s start with an improvised R&amp;B multi-track piece; here is <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/Demo/Rochus%20Soul%201.mp3">the original track from 2005</a>. And <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/RochusSoul1_suno_randb.mp3">here is what Suno made of it</a>.</p>



<p>Now for RTS, an old jazz-rock piece from the eighties; <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/Demo/Rochus%20RTS.mp3">here is the original track</a> fed into Suno. And <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/RochusRTS_suno_jazz_rock_brass_section.mp3">here what Suno made of it</a>. It’s interesting to note that Suno had problems recognizing the chords of the bridge.</p>



<p>Now a bossa nova jazz rock piece I wrote for my band in the eighties called “Radha Kundha”; <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/Demo/Rochus%20RadhaKundha.mp3">here is the original track</a> fed into Suno. Here are two generated versions:</p>



<ul><li><a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/RadhaKundha_suno_latin.mp3">Latin Jazz with small band with acc. guitar</a>; theme and chords are pretty accurate.</li><li><a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/RadhaKundha_suno_cuban_orchestra.mp3">Cuban orchestra with acc. guitar</a>; here Sudo composed a prelude before the orchestra kicks in.</li></ul>



<p>“Turn around” is yet another piece from the eighties which I composed for my band at the time; <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/Demo/TurnAround.mp3">here is the original track</a> fed into Suno. And here whate comes out:</p>



<ul><li><a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/TurnAround_suno_cuban.mp3">Cuban version</a>; theme is perfect, some chords don’t fit, and Suno added another part, which is ok.</li><li><a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/TurnAround_suno_bossa.mp3">Bossa nova version</a>; here the chords fit and the piece closely follows the original, but it missed a note in the theme; still great.</li></ul>



<p>“Lonely Friend” is a piece I wrote in the early nineties, which I wasn’t able to record until ten years later; <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/Demo/LonelyFriend.mp3">here is the original track</a> fed into Suno. And here the result:</p>



<ul><li><a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/LonelyFriend_suno_guitar_piano.mp3">Acc. guitar and piano</a>; both theme and chords are not very accurate, but still beautiful.</li><li><a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/LonelyFriend_suno_soprano_piano.mp3">Electric guitar, soprano sax and piano</a>; again neither chords nor theme fully accurate, but beautiful.</li></ul>



<p>Here are some tracks from <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/?p=301">this album from 1993</a>:</p>



<p>Here is <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/Sequencer1993/10.mp3">the original recording</a>. And here two examples of Suno interpretations:</p>



<ul><li><a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/1993_10_suno_african_jazz_rock.mp3">Close to original african jazz rock</a></li><li><a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/1993_10_suno_bulgarian_brass_band.mp3">Bulgarian brass band jazz rock</a></li></ul>



<h3>Generating from live performance recording</h3>



<p>Here are some tracks from a (not particularly good) live recording from <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/?p=462">this 1989 album</a>.</p>



<p>“Türkis” is a 7/8 piece which is part of a larger composition of mine from around 1985; <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/1989-FGK-Zug/Tuerkis.mp3">here is how we played it in 1989</a>. And here is a <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/Tuerkis_suno_balkan_remastered.mp3">version generated with the Bulgarien brass band by Suno</a>; pretty accurate and I very much like the drums.</p>



<p>Here is a slow ballade which I wrote at the time of this concert: <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/1989-FGK-Zug/ASeptembersWar.mp3">A Septembers War</a>. And here is <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/ASeptembersWar_sumo_soprano_sax.mp3">the interpretation by Suno</a>; the piece apparently was a challenge for the algorithm; but still beautiful.</p>



<h3>Generating from studio multitrack mix</h3>



<p>The following pieces are from <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/?p=239">this album from 1987</a>, which I recorded on a Fostex eight track tape machine and mixed it down to DAT. </p>



<p><a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/Songs/Jugendalbum2-Track01.mp3">A jazz rock composition of mine</a>, and <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/Jugendalbum2-Track01_suno_jazz_rock.mp3">the Suno interpretation</a>, which is only a subset of the piece because of the two minute limitation.</p>



<p>Yet another <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/Songs/Jugendalbum2-Track02.mp3">jazz rock composition of mine</a>, and <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/Jugendalbum2-Track02_suno_jazz_rock.mp3">the Suno interpretation</a>; the harmonies were apparently a challenge for Suno.</p>



<p>Here is the original recording of a <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/Songs/Jugendalbum2-Track03.mp3">ballad called “High”</a> which I wrote at the time. The <a href="http://rochus-keller.ch/suno_2025/Jugendalbum2-Track03_suno_soprano_piano.mp3">interpretation by Suno</a> is surprisingly accurate and comes very close to the original.</p>



<p>More to come.</p>
