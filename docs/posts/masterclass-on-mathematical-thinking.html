<p>About a year ago, I was contacted by <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/">Masterclass</a> (a subscription-based online education company) on the possibility of producing a series of classes with the premise of explaining mathematical ways of thinking (such as reducing a complex problem to simpler sub-problems, abstracting out inessential aspects of a problem, or applying transforms or analogies to find new ways of thinking about a problem).  After a lot of discussion and planning, as well as a film shoot over the summer, the series is <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/classes/terence-tao-teaches-mathematical-thinking">now completed</a>.  As per their business model, the full lecture series is only available to subscribers of their platform, but the above link does contain a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axzFfSvQdYQ">trailer</a> and some sample content.</p>
