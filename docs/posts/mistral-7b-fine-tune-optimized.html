OpenPipe is the fully-managed fine-tuning platform for developers. Our users have already saved over $2M in inference costs by switching to our fine-tuned models, and it only takes a few minutes to get started.</em></p><p>Since its release in September, <!-- --><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/" rel="noopener">Mistral 7B</a> has been the model <!-- --><a href="https://openpipe.ai/blog/llama-2-vs-mistral-believe-the-hype" rel="noopener">we’ve recommended</a> to most of our customers.

How is this possible?</h3><p>The intuition here is actually quite straightforward. A general-purpose model like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 has to be good at <!-- --><strong>everything</strong>. It doesn’t know ahead of time what prompt it’ll need to respond to, and so it has to try to encode all of human knowledge. Additionally, every time it gets a new prompt it it has to figure out the right way to respond on the fly—it can’t think deeply about the problem and figure out a repeatable strategy to solve it. It can’t remember the times it has solved the same problem before.<!-- --></p><p>The process of fine-tuning, on the other hand, lets a model spend <!-- --><strong>hours</strong> of training time learning about a specific task and developing strategies to reliably solve it. Even if it’s a less capable model overall, those hours of GPU time can help a fine-tuned model learn the right tricks to efficiently and successfully solve a specific problem.[1]<!-- --></p><h3>There are lots of Mistral fine-tunes. Why another one?</h3><p>A <!-- --><a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard" rel="noopener">very healthy ecosystem</a> of Mistral fine-tunes already exists, but they’re typically optimized for direct use. We wanted something different — a model optimized to be the strongest <!-- --><strong>base model</strong> for further fine-tunes to be built on. This involves carefully optimizing for instruction understanding and reasoning ability while avoiding “catastrophic forgetting,” the tendency for fine-tuned models to get worse at out-of-domain tasks when you fine-tune them for a specific purpose.<!-- --></p><h2>Ok, let’s get the details!</h2><h3>You can’t hit a target you can’t see (Metrics)</h3><p>We started by creating a “test set” of 3 different real OpenPipe customer tasks (with permission). These spanned our most common categories of information extraction, classification, and summarization. The goal was to find or create a new model that, when fine-tuned on these customer tasks, could outperform Mistral-based models on our evals, and become our new default base model.</p><h3>Choose your hero</h3><p>We started by evaluating existing Mistral variants to see how they’d perform as a base model. After playing around with a number of models we selected six that seemed promising: <!-- --><a href="https://huggingface.co/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B" rel="noopener">OpenHermes 2.5</a>, <!-- --><a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta" rel="noopener">Zephyr</a>, <!-- --><a href="https://huggingface.co/fblgit/una-cybertron-7b-v2-bf16" rel="noopener">Cybertron</a>, <!-- --><a href="https://huggingface.co/Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3" rel="noopener">Intel Neural Chat</a>, <!-- --><a href="https://huggingface.co/Weyaxi/OpenHermes-2.5-neural-chat-v3-3-Slerp" rel="noopener">Hermes Neural</a>, and <!-- --><a href="https://huggingface.co/Q-bert/MetaMath-Cybertron-Starling" rel="noopener">Metamath Cybertron Starling</a>. We created a fine-tuned version of each of these models on each of the 3 evaluation datasets, using a development build of OpenPipe that supports custom base models. This gave us 18 new models in total.<!-- --></p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,0YBrNdAVhE5FXP3EYzEARM5tjk.png" data-framer-height="1578" data-framer-width="1388" height="789" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/0YBrNdAVhE5FXP3EYzEARM5tjk.png" width="694"/></p><p><em>This dropdown ended up getting really long by the end of this project. </em>😂<!-- --></p><h3>Beauty in the eye of GPT-4 (Evals)</h3><p>To test each model’s performance, we used our <!-- --><a href="https://openpipe.ai/blog/announcing-automatic-evals-for-fine-tuned-models" rel="noopener">recently released</a> automated LLM-as-judge evals scored by GPT-4, which allowed us to quickly compare our fine-tunes to each other and gauge their strength.<!-- --></p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,WhIW85zZSh5QTVSbJBE74Ggtw.png" data-framer-height="1374" data-framer-width="1364" height="687" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/WhIW85zZSh5QTVSbJBE74Ggtw.png" width="682"/></p><p>The top model wasn’t consistent from task to task, but we did notice something interesting—two of the best-performing models overall were <!-- --><a href="https://huggingface.co/Weyaxi/OpenHermes-2.5-neural-chat-v3-3-Slerp" rel="noopener">Hermes Neural</a> and <!-- --><a href="https://huggingface.co/Q-bert/MetaMath-Cybertron-Starling" rel="noopener">Metamath Cybertron Starling</a>, which were both created not by fine-tuning directly but rather through <!-- --><strong>model merging.</strong></p><h3>Magical thinking and model merging 🪄🤯</h3><p>Model merging is, to me, one of the most counterintuitive empirical results in modern deep learning. It turns out that you can actually <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/yule-BUAA/MergeLM/tree/main" rel="noopener">more-or-less naively</a> merge the weights of two different models and produce a new one that captures some or all of the abilities of its parents! Since we had a candidate set of already-strong models, we decided to merge a few of the best ones and see if we could make one even stronger.<!-- --></p><p>We ended up testing <!-- --><strong>4</strong> models created by merging our candidates and fine-tuning each of them on our 3 datasets, for a total of 12 additional fine-tuned models.<!-- --></p><p>At this stage, evaluating every fine-tune against every other one across our large test sets felt pretty wasteful, since some models were clearly stronger than others. Instead, we ran <!-- --><strong>9,000</strong> comparisons between our models’ outputs and those of GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-3.5, and ranked them using a <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley%E2%80%93Terry_model" rel="noopener">Bradley-Terry</a> ranking system, which is conceptually similar to an Elo rating. (You can see our ugly rating calculation code <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/OpenPipe/OpenPipe/blob/add-models-take-2/app/scripts/rank-base-models.ts" rel="noopener">here</a>). Finally, we got our model rankings, which showed one merge in particular was especially strong:<!-- --></p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,x8EJIYMrB5tcld5dBKipGZA9ck.png" data-framer-height="1186" data-framer-width="1404" height="593" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/x8EJIYMrB5tcld5dBKipGZA9ck.png" width="702"/></p><h3>Check yo’self (Validation)</h3><p>This was a really exciting result—averaged over our three example tasks, one of our merges slightly edged out GPT-4 as the strongest model! But there’s a problem. We’d been testing all our models, including the merges, on the same 3 datasets—was it possible that we’d overfit to those specific tasks?</p><p>To address this concern we selected a new customer dataset we hadn’t used at all thus far (a structured data extraction task). We trained our new merge model as well as a base Mistral model on the new dataset, to verify whether its strong performance generalized to new tasks. Excitingly, the same results held!</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,kBQT073XTjgRj96ed3L0RSaiTrE.png" data-framer-height="568" data-framer-width="1376" height="284" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/kBQT073XTjgRj96ed3L0RSaiTrE.png" width="688"/></p><h2>We’re just getting started</h2><p>We’re excited to announce that as of today we’re freely releasing Mistral Fine-Tune Optimized <!-- --><a href="https://huggingface.co/OpenPipe/mistral-ft-optimized-1218" rel="noopener">on Hugging Face</a> and as our new default base model within <!-- --><a href="https://openpipe.ai/" rel="noopener">OpenPipe</a>.

We’ve had several customers train a model on GPT-4 outputs, and found that their new model was actually <!-- --><strong>better</strong> than GPT-4 at its task. This is likely due to a kind of regularization—the fine-tuned model is more likely to give the “average” answer that GPT-4 would give if prompted many times.
