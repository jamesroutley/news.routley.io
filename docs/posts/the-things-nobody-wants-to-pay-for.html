The free-software community has managed to build a body of software that is
worth, by most estimates, many billions of dollars; all of this code is
freely available to anybody who wants to use or modify it.  It is an
unparalleled example of independent actors working cooperatively on a
common resource.  Free software is certainly a success story, but all is
not perfect.  One of the community&#39;s greatest strengths — convincing
companies to contribute to this common resource — is also part of one of
its biggest weaknesses.
</p><p>
The GNU project, as described by Richard Stallman in the 1985 <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html">GNU Manifesto</a>, looked
hopelessly ambitious at the time.  To many of us, it seemed that only large
companies could build operating systems, and that a group of volunteers
would never be able to aspire to such a goal.  The volunteers got
surprisingly far, to the point that, less than ten years after the GNU
Manifesto was published, running a system on only free software (or
something close to that) was possible.  It was an impressive achievement.
</p><p>
Even then, though, that software not entirely devoid of corporate
contributions.  The X Window System, for example, was the product of a
commercial consortium that predated Linux.  The development of GCC was
pushed forward by companies like Cygnus Computing.  When the Linux kernel
arrived on the scene, there was indeed a substantial body of GNU software
that could run on it, but there was a nontrivial amount of
company-contributed software as well.
</p><p>
Linux in the 1990s still lagged far behind the proprietary Unix systems in
many ways, even though it was better in others.  That began to change with
the arrival of corporate funding, which supercharged development on Linux
and on free software in general.  Without it, we would not have the system
we take for granted today.  Companies, working in their own interest, have
built up our body of free software hugely; it is almost as if this
capitalism thing actually works.
</p><p>
The problem, of course, is that these companies have a tendency to
interpret their own self-interest rather narrowly.  They will happily pay
to develop a driver for a hardware product, but they are less interested in
supporting the maintainership and review that are needed to integrate that
driver, the development of the subsystem into which the driver fits, or
the support the driver will need over the years.  Companies pay for
thousands of developers to work on the kernel, but none pays for a single
technical writer to create documentation.  Work that is not seen as
contributing to short-term revenue tends not to get much attention in the
corporate world.
</p><p>
There are, needless to say, numerous other pathologies exhibited by
corporations in the open-source community.  These include license
violations, free-riding, throwing code over the wall, and more.  Projects
that are controlled by a single company are often particularly problematic.
These difficulties have often been covered elsewhere; today the focus is on
the failure to support parts of the community that we all depend on.
</p><p>
Consider some recent examples of how this behavior affects the development
and user communities.
</p><p>
In a recent linux-kernel discussion, Kent Overstreet <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/2uh4sgj5mqqkuv7h7fjlpigwjurcxoo6mqxz7cjyzh4edvqdhv@h2y6ytnh37tj/">complained</a>
about the lack of testing infrastructure for the kernel, calling it a
failure of leadership.  Greg Kroah-Hartman, instead, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/2024011532-mortician-region-8302@gregkh/">said that
the problem lies elsewhere</a>: &#34;<q>No, they fall into the &#39;no company
wants to pay someone to do the work&#39; category, so it doesn&#39;t get done.</q>&#34;
He pointed out that there is not much the leadership (such as it is in the
kernel community) can do in a situation like this.  So testing
infrastructure for the kernel tends to languish.
</p><p>
Also recently, Konstantin Ryabitsev, the keeper of kernel.org and the
author of the <a href="https://people.kernel.org/monsieuricon/introducing-b4-and-patch-attestation">b4
tool</a>, <a href="https://social.kernel.org/notice/Ae0x6yb73Oinx4WznE">apologized</a>
for a lack of progress with b4, observing that he has not been able to get
the go-ahead to put time into that work.  He later <a href="https://social.kernel.org/notice/Ae2y1fgYQjHQ7R1xDc">clarified</a>
that post: &#34;<q>it just means that we haven&#39;t properly reallocated resources
to allow me to prioritize tooling work</q>&#34;.  He has a lot of demands on
his time, and b4 has not been able to rise to the top of the list.
</p><p>
This matters; anybody who has been watching kernel development over the
last few years has seen that b4 has transformed the maintainer&#39;s task in
many ways.  It must have paid back the effort that went into its
development many times over.  The kernel community has never put the effort
into tooling that it needs; the advent of b4 was a change in that pattern
and one that we would all like to see continue.
</p><p>
One can easily criticize the Linux Foundation (LF) for not supporting this
work at the level that we would like.  But the fact of the matter is that
the LF is about the only entity that has supported this work <i>at all</i>;
without that support, we would not have b4.  So, while encouraging the LF
to more strongly support b4 is a good thing to do, it is also worth asking
why no other company has seen fit to support that work, despite the fact
that they have all benefited from it.  The incentives that drive companies
(and their managers) simply leave little room for this kind of work, even
though the benefits from it would be real and immediate.
</p><p>
In a different part of our community, a discussion on the upcoming <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2024/01/15/clear-course-is-set-for-os-leap/">openSUSE
Leap 16</a> distribution has led to <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/opensuse-factory/9B42BF3F-2D93-4FCF-A479-DE292AC9F989@opensuse.org/">fears</a>
that this version of the distribution will not support packages like KDE or
Thunderbird — fears that are arguably getting ahead of the game, since they
have not yet been confirmed by SUSE.  Such a move would seem similar to Red
Hat&#39;s <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/933525/">decision to drop LibreOffice</a> from Red
Hat Enterprise Linux.  Support from companies for the Linux desktop, it
seems, is threatened.
</p><p>
Once again, it comes down to corporate priority setting, though with a
slightly different driving force.  Companies like Red Hat and SUSE (and a
number of others) have supported Linux desktop development heavily for many
years.  But that investment is not seen as paying off.  As Neal Gompa <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/opensuse-factory/CAEg-Je_+Di-kn=k5Nd76Bx0DHdRkK9Mx8jHQ=izHkuunAACLgA@mail.gmail.com/">put
it</a> in the Leap discussion:
</p><blockquote>
	Have you ever wondered why KDE was deprecated in RHEL? It wasn&#39;t
	just because KDE Plasma 5 was so big that they couldn&#39;t make the
	jump for RHEL 8, it was also because people were not paying for
	RHEL for the desktop, so they had no budget for more people. It
	happened again with the layoffs at Red Hat last year. SUSE is no
	different. And Ubuntu?  Canonical already did their big layoff in
	2017 where they laid off hundreds of staff related to the desktop.
</blockquote>
<p>
In many parts of the system, the work that leads to some company making
money just happens to benefit all of us, even if we are not directly paying
for it.  But, seemingly, that path toward making money is more elusive in
the desktop realm; those of us who are using desktop Linux are not
generally paying for the privilege, and neither is anybody else.  So the
resources going into desktop development are reduced, and Linux desktop
users will feel the effects of that.
</p><p>
Then, consider <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pypi-account-recovery-process-triaging-on-halt/43422/50">this
ongoing discussion</a> in the Python community about funding for the PyPI
repository.  As &#34;fungi&#34; put it:
</p><blockquote>
	Companies are unlikely to fund open source communities that are
	critical to their own business because “someone else will do it,”
	so it ends up falling on a handful of volunteers and people
	donating their own time after hours because they’re already being
	paid to work full time on other stuff.
</blockquote>
<p>
There are few projects in our community that do not contain this kind of
neglected area.
</p><p>
Solutions to these problems are not easy to come by.  Criticizing companies
for a failure to support the ecosystem they depend on can have results, but
only to a point.  Organizations like the LF can organize resources toward
the solution of common problems, but they have to please the same companies
that are paying their bills in the end.  Governments can help to fund areas
that the market has passed over; that path gets harder in the absence of a
functioning government, which is the situation to varying degrees in many
parts of the world at the moment.
</p><p>
If we cannot find a solution, we are likely to be forced back to our roots,
depending on volunteers to do the work in areas that companies decline to
fund.  That can be successful, but often at a high cost to the people who
are doing that work.  Depending on volunteers is not an inclusive approach;
there are a lot of people who do not have the luxury of giving many hours
of their time to this kind of project.  Progress in that world will be
slow.
</p><p>
The community that has accomplished so much over the last few decades
should be capable of doing better than that.  We have solved many problems
getting to the point we are at now — problems that few thought we would be
able to overcome; we should be able to find a way around these difficulties
as well.  It will be interesting to see what we come up with.<br clear="all"/></p>
