The web of U.S. laws and regulations complicate financial transactions and the acquisition of goods and services by the Cuban government.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">U.S. diplomat Paul Folmsbee, in a brief speech opposing the resolution, said the embargo was aimed at promoting &#34;human rights and fundamental liberties in Cuba&#34; and that the U.S. made exceptions for humanitarian purposes.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">&#34;The United States continues to be a significant source of humanitarian goods to the Cuban people and one of Cuba&#39;s main trading partners,&#34; the diplomat said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">He noted that the United States last year sold Cuba $295 million worth of agricultural products.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">The long-running dispute between Cuba and the United States shows little sign of detente, despite some modest gestures of goodwill under the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Biden has taken small steps to ease restrictions on Cuba, boosting consular services but doing little to repeal the Trump sanctions.</p><p data-testid="Body">Reporting by Nelson Acosta, editing by Dave Sherwood and Rosalba O&#39;Brien</p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
