            <p>When I was a kid, Reebok released sneakers with a computer chip in the tongue that could tell you how fast you ran and how high you jumped. They were called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-0wGzicjGc">Reebok Traxtar</a> and I thought they were the coolest thing ever, so I begged my parents to get me a pair.</p><p>After lacing them up and running and jumping around the neighborhood, the energetic child in me was dismayed to find that the shoe&#39;s beeping noises and LEDs were incomprehensible and the stats made no sense. I was still excited to wear them to school until they started beeping and lighting up during class with no way to turn them off. My teacher soon banned the shoes and I had to return them. üò¢</p><p>In the 1990s, technologists saw that smart devices would become ubiquitous, potentially becoming an overwhelming source of distraction and information overload. This led to the concept of ambient computing</p><p>In stark contrast to my Reebok Traxtars, ambient computing is about moving computing into the background by empowering our devices with accurate context, so they can help us, without getting in the way. The goal is to create <em>calm</em> technology.</p><p>This article introduces a new powerful sensing technology‚ÄîmmWave radar‚Äîand how it can make our environments and personal devices better aware and adaptive to our needs.</p><figure><img src="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/image.png" alt="JCPenney Catalog, Reebok sneakers advertisement" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="769" srcset="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/image.png 600w, https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/image.png 1000w, https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/image.png 1600w, https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/image.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Rebook Traxtar ad. JCPenney Catalog 2000</figcaption></figure><h2 id="mmwave-background">mmWave background</h2><hr/><p>On July 13, 2021, the <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-21-83A1.pdf">FCC announced a proposal to open up the 60 GHz band for commercial mmWave applications</a>. This opened the floodgates for companies to commercialize products using mmWave by removing the time and cost required to obtain a waiver from the FCC.<sup>[<a href="#waivers">1</a>]</sup> In the FCC‚Äôs proposal, they outline three general applications for mmWave:</p><ul><li>Indoor communication</li><li>Outdoor communication</li><li>Radar</li></ul><blockquote>Our proposal recognizes the increasing practicality of using mobile radar devices in the 60 GHz band to perform innovative and life-saving functions, including gesture control, detection of unattended children in vehicles, and monitoring of vulnerable medical patients, and it is designed to stimulate the development of new products and services in a wide variety of areas to include, for example, personal safety, autonomous vehicles, home automation, environmental control, and healthcare monitoring.</blockquote><p>mmWave radar‚Äôs &#34;increasing practicality&#34; comes from recent advances in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_CMOS">CMOS</a> manufacturing that allow very high-frequency circuits and antennas to be placed directly onto the radar chip. And because mmWave antennas are small, they can fit into a very small package.</p><div><p>A single chip can now include the radar, antennas, and computation which allows companies to incorporate mmWave sensors into new products at a much lower cost.</p></div><p>The size, cost, power consumption, reliability, and performance have all improved significantly in recent years. Combined with increases in computing power, these sensors can interpret complex signals using machine learning algorithms, putting mmWave radar at a sweet spot for adoption.</p><figure><a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/soli-radar-based-perception-and.html"><img src="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/image-1.png" alt="Image of 6 radar chips decreasing in size" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1000" srcset="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/image-1.png 600w, https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/image-1.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></a><figcaption>mmWave sensors have dramatically decreased in size and complexity. Image credit: Google</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-mmwave-radar-works">How mmWave radar works</h2><hr/><p>Radar works by transmitting electromagnetic waveforms and processing the returning waveforms as they are reflected back from the environment. Each reflected waveform, with its comparison to the original waveform, contains information that can be used to determine the size, location, direction, and speed of objects in the radar&#39;s field of view.</p><p>Radar technology covers a wide range of frequencies and processing techniques making it extremely versatile. It has been used for a plethora of applications, from tracking insects to reporting the weather, to sensing phenomena in outer space.</p><p>The wavelength or frequency of the radar signal dictates the distance at which it can travel and the size of objects it can detect. As defined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum">International Communications Union (ITU)</a>, the mmWave spectrum falls into the second-highest or ‚Äúextremely high frequency‚Äù radar band, just below the terahertz or ‚Äútremendously high frequency‚Äù band. (If they could squeeze in one more band without already entering the infrared spectrum they‚Äôd have to call it the ‚Äúludicrously high frequency‚Äù band, or maybe just the ‚Äúplaid band‚Äù üòÑ). A 60 GHz signal has a wavelength of 5 mm, about the size of a pencil eraser. Relative to human proportions this is quite small, which allows mmWave radar to capture detailed information about us and our physical environment.</p><p>For a more in-depth introduction on the fundamentals of mmWave radar (specifically frequency modulated continuous wave FMCW), see this <a href="https://training.ti.com/intro-mmwave-sensing-fmcw-radars-module-1-range-estimation">5 part video series</a> from Texas Instruments.</p><h2 id="mmwave-radar-advantages">mmWave radar advantages</h2><hr/><p>What makes new mmWave radar sensors so useful is that they contain multiple antennas, allowing them to sense in four dimensions. In addition to sensing objects in three-dimensional space, they can also understand the velocity of each reflected point.<sup>[<a href="#4d">2</a>]</sup> Imagine having another sense where each point in space you saw had a different hue based on its instantaneous velocity.</p><p>The diagram below compares different sensor examples and how many dimensions they output. As you would expect, as the dimensions increase, the richness and usefulness of the information increases.</p><figure><img src="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/dimensions.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="500" srcset="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/dimensions.png 600w, https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/dimensions.png 1000w, https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/dimensions.png 1500w"/></figure><p>One of mmWave&#39;s major advantages is its privacy-preserving nature. Because mmWave radar doesn‚Äôt process visual light, what it sees is not personally identifiable. This makes it an ideal choice for monitoring where a camera would not be appropriate.</p><blockquote>Radar sensors happen to be usually rich in detail, but highly anonymizing, unlike cameras. If your doppler radar data leaked online, it‚Äôd be hard to be embarrassed about it. No one would recognize you. If cameras from inside your house leaked online, well‚Ä¶ </blockquote><p>Another benefit of radar is that it can see through plastic and other materials. This makes it a great choice for consumer electronics because it can be placed underneath the enclosure.</p><p>Radar is also immune to environmental factors such as light, temperature, and dust which allows it to see in environments where a camera would be blind.</p><blockquote>It&#39;s extremely reliable. There&#39;s nothing to break. There&#39;s no moving parts. There&#39;s no lenses. There&#39;s nothing, just a piece of sand on your board. </blockquote><p>The chart below shows how radar compares with the most common ADAS sensors: cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and lidar. Radar performs very well across almost all criteria with the exception of detection resolution. Lidar and cameras process infrared and visible light, respectively, which gives them higher resolution.</p><figure><img src="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/image-3.png" alt="Chart showing how radar compares with camera, ultrasonic, and lidar sensors" loading="lazy" width="896" height="476" srcset="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/image-3.png 600w, https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/image-3.png 896w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>How radar compares to other sensors. Image credit: Novelic</figcaption></figure><p>The real power of mmWave sensor data comes when it is processed using machine learning. The rich sensing data can be used to create accurate machine learning models capable of classifying various activities. For example, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University were able to accurately classify different activities such as waving, squats, cycling, clapping, lunges, and jumping jacks using doppler data.<sup>[<a href="#cmu">3</a>]</sup> Other researchers have been able to classify a variety of complex materials using mmWave and machine learning.<sup>[<a href="#radarcat">4</a>]</sup></p><figure><img src="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/image-4.png" alt="Person on stationary bike with image of doppler signal and machine learning prediction" loading="lazy" width="1536" height="863" srcset="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/image-4.png 600w, https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/image-4.png 1000w, https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/image-4.png 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>mmWave doppler data can classify different activities while maintaining privacy.

Project Soli was first presented at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GJo_kPLCTQ">Google IO in 2015</a> by Ivan Poupyrev where he showed how mmWave radar could detect subtle hand gestures. These touchless gestures could then be used to extend the user interface of something like a smartwatch.</p><figure><img src="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/Project-Soli-GIF.gif" alt="Smartwatch controlled using touchless gestures" loading="lazy" width="640" height="359"/><figcaption>Soli-powered smartwatch demo at Google IO 2016</figcaption></figure><blockquote>It offers a third dimension of interaction, which compliments and enhances other interaction modalities, such as touch screen and voice input. </blockquote><p>In October 2019, Soli shipped in the <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/soli-radar-based-perception-and.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixel 4</a>, marketed to consumers as &#34;Motion Sense.&#34; It provided users with a faster face unlock along with some basic touchless gestures like controlling music. Google must have decided it was still too early as they haven‚Äôt included Soli in any of the Pixel phones since.</p><p>However, Google is still very committed to using its Soli technology. The most recent application is in the <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/new-nest-hub-soli/">second-gen Nest Hub</a> which launched in 2021 with &#34;Sleep Sensing.&#34;</p><blockquote>Sleep Sensing uses <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ai.googleblog.com/2021/03/contactless-sleep-sensing-in-nest-hub.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1615859099066000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2MppB8qClOvlAjlQQli4fJ">Motion Sense (powered by Soli low-energy radar technology)</a> to analyze how the person closest to the display is sleeping, based on their movement and breathing ‚Äî all without a camera or wearable.</blockquote><p>Over the holidays, the Nest Hub was selling for $60 which shows the technology has become cheap enough for mass-market consumer devices. A <a href="https://electronics360.globalspec.com/article/17053/teardown-google-nest-hub-2nd-gen">teardown</a> of the device shows the radar chip from Infineon (<a href="https://www.eetimes.com/infineon-flies-under-the-radar-on-googles-soli/#">who helped co-develop Soli</a>) costing $3.65. And through <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/11/enhanced-sleep-sensing-in-nest-hub.html">ongoing research</a>, Google is continuing to improve its sensing algorithms.</p><figure><img src="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/image-7.png" alt="Google Nest Hub with sleep hypnogram on screen" loading="lazy" width="639" height="478" srcset="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/image-7.png 600w, https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/image-7.png 639w"/><figcaption>Google Nest Hub sleep sensing hypnogram. Image credit: Google</figcaption></figure><h3 id="amazon-3d-motion-detection"><strong>Amazon 3D Motion Detection</strong></h3><p>Amazon is next in the tech giants to introduce mmWave radar into their products. At the beginning of 2021, they launched the <a href="https://ring.com/products/video-doorbell-pro-2">Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2</a> with mmWave radar-powered capabilities marketed as &#34;3D Motion Detection&#34; and &#34;Bird&#39;s Eye View.&#34;</p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.ring.com/2021/02/24/the-next-generation-of-motion-detection/">announcement</a>, Ring&#39;s founder, Jamie Siminoff explains why consumers will love it:</p><blockquote>3D Motion Detection and Bird‚Äôs Eye View are about giving you more control and context at home. With 3D Motion Detection, you‚Äôll receive smarter, more relevant alerts thanks to the radar sensor, which pinpoints precise information related to your motion alerts, including exactly when and where visitors travel on your property through Bird‚Äôs Eye View.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/21_2_19_Birds_Eyes_View_9_432x540-1-1.gif" alt="Person approaching doorbell" loading="lazy" width="674" height="477"/><figcaption>The new Ring Doorbell with mmWave radar. Image credit: Amazon</figcaption></figure><p>Amazon‚Äôs new doorbell shows that mmWave radar is more capable than a passive infrared (PIR) sensor and is also a powerful companion to a camera. The internet is full of articles and forums discussing false alarm problems caused by the PIR sensors. As mmWave radar becomes cheaper and more ubiquitous, Ring will be able to eliminate all of these false alarms. This is because radar is not affected by environmental factors like light and temperature and can distinguish between objects, instead of simply detecting motion. And as a companion to a simple camera, radar can see through things like trees and bushes as well as provide a 3D mapping to the camera‚Äôs 2D video stream.</p><p>Amazon is also following Google‚Äôs lead in <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/amazon-eyes-soli-style-radar-sensors-for-sleep-tracking-and-smart-home-12682096/">integrating radar for sleep sensing</a>.</p><h3 id="apple-mmwave-powered-homepod"><strong>Apple mmWave-powered HomePod</strong></h3><p>Apple is also working on adding mmWave radar to their products, but as you might expect, they are working behind the scenes as they wait for the technology to further mature and can release a polished implementation.</p><p>In early 2021 they were granted a patent for an <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10928498B1/en?oq=10%2c928%2c498">Electronic device with circular radar-antenna array</a> which shows what would likely be a HomePod using a 360-degree mmWave sensor array to understand how nearby users are interacting with it. This would give it a better understanding of context and user intent which might include detecting gestures, allowing the user to control the device without having to yell &#34;Hey Siri!&#34;; detecting the user&#39;s identity based on their gait, height, and physical profile; and determining a user‚Äôs medical condition by measuring their vital signs.</p><h3 id="office-space-monitoring"><strong>Office space monitoring</strong></h3><p>Since the pandemic, businesses have had to rethink what the future of the office will look like. One startup working on solving this problem, Density, provides real-time occupancy monitoring using privacy-preserving radar technology.

However, the radar that Tesla removed had low resolution and we will likely see mmWave radar in future Tesla vehicles for ADAS. We will also start seeing mmWave radar used inside the cabin as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377981/tesla-radar-sensor-child-hot-car-fcc">sensor to detect a child left behind in a hot car</a> and to monitor the well-being of the driver by measuring their vital signs.</p><p>There are a handful of companies working on radar for cars including <a href="https://www.novelic.com">Novelic</a>, <a href="https://arberobotics.com">Arbe</a>, <a href="https://vayyar.com">Vayyar</a>, <a href="https://www.uhnder.com">Uhnder</a>, and <a href="https://www.oculii.com">Oculii</a> (recently acquired by Ambarella for $307M).</p><h3 id="sleep-sensing"><strong>Sleep sensing</strong></h3><p>The big tech giants are not the only ones using mmWave for sleep sensing. <a href="https://mikucare.com">Miku</a> is a startup company focused on sleep sensing for infants.

This enables imaging applications like <a href="https://www.thruwave.com">package inspection</a> and <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/nationalsecurity/millimeterwave/learn_more.stm">airport security</a>.</p><h2 id="mmwave-wireless-communication">mmWave wireless communication</h2><hr/><p>mmWave is also being used for both indoor and outdoor wireless communication. The well-known outdoor application, mmWave 5G, has been advertised for a few years now. All the major cellular providers like Verizon and T-Mobile are working on mmWave deployments as are other projects like Facebook <a href="https://terragraph.com">Terragraph</a> and startup <a href="https://www.aervivo.com">Aervivo</a>. The challenge with deploying mmWave internet service is that given the small wavelength of the signals they do not travel very far in comparison to lower frequency radio waves, making deployments very expensive.<sup>[<a href="#mmwave-5G">5</a>]</sup></p><p>Indoor mmWave communication is a bit more practical because of the shorter distances required. The 60 GHz WiFi standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiGig">WiGig</a> has been around since 2009 and has slowly been gaining more traction. Intel, for example, has built a wireless adapter for the Vive VR headset using WiGig that has near-zero latency and can transfer data at an astonishing 4.6 Gbps.</p><p>The most recent WiFi standard in development combines techniques in both radar and communications to provide <a href="https://staceyoniot.com/the-next-big-wi-fi-standard-is-for-sensing-not-communication/">wireless sensing using WiFi routers</a>. A <a href="https://www.cs.wm.edu/~yma/files/WiFiSensing_YongsenMa_authorversion.pdf">survey on the research</a> already conducted shows that WiFi is capable of becoming not only a communications standard but also a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14918">fully-fledged sensing paradigm</a>.</p><h2 id="standardization">Standardization</h2><hr/><p>mmWave communication has obviously required standardization so that devices can talk to each other, but what about standardization for radar applications?</p><figure><img src="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/image-9.png" alt="Ripple Logo" loading="lazy" width="680" height="435" srcset="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/image-9.png 600w, https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/image-9.png 680w"/></figure><p>Earlier this month at CES, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) announced <a href="https://www.cta.tech/Resources/Newsroom/Media-Releases/2022/January/CTA-Partners-with-Industry-Leaders-to-Announce-Rip?_ga=2.27689532.1222861381.1643298562-1051639986.1643298562">Ripple</a>, an open API for developing general-purpose consumer radar systems. Participants include Google, Ford, Blumio, Infineon, NXP, and Texas Instruments. With recent advances making radar smaller, lower power, and cheaper, it has become practical to use across a wide range of applications. The lingering problem is the development required to get each unique application up and running from scratch.</p><blockquote>Radar sensing systems have historically been designed for single applications, with hardware and software custom-developed for each purpose. This means that traditional product solutions ‚Äî from the hardware to the final user experience ‚Äî are bespoke.</blockquote><p>Creating a standardized layer of abstraction will reduce development time by leveraging prebuilt sensing libraries. The four main applications that Ripple currently sees are:</p><ul><li>Non-invasive wellness monitoring</li><li>Occupancy detection</li><li>Human activity recognition</li><li>Touchless gesture controls</li></ul><p>As radar systems become more standardized across hardware and software, engineers and designers will be able to more easily ‚Äòdrag and drop‚Äô these capabilities into new products and we will start to see mmWave radar widely used‚Äîboth as an alternative to less capable sensors and to unlock completely new experiences and value for users.</p><h2 id="human-computer-interaction-challenges">Human-computer interaction challenges</h2><hr/><p>Although this all sounds super exciting, the technology is still very early, especially in how designers approach these new user interfaces. One thing we surely want to avoid is this comical scene from The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy:</p><blockquote>A loud clatter of gunk music flooded through the Heart of Gold cabin as Zappos searched the sub-etha radio wave bands for news of himself. The machine was rather difficult to operate. For years radios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turning dials; then as the technology became more sophisticated the controls were made touch-sensitive - you merely had to brush the panels with your fingers; now all you had to do was wave your hand in the general direction of the components and hope. It saved a lot of muscular expenditure of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening to the same programme.</blockquote><p>Technology shouldn‚Äôt be added just for the sake of it. Even with all the new technologies available to us, some products still call for a good old-fashioned button with a familiar tactile click.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges for mmWave adoption is rethinking how we interact with our devices. Adding a new dimension of interaction presents both a challenge and an opportunity for designers to create intuitive and accessible interfaces. It will also require marketers to educate consumers who may be hesitant to welcome unfamiliar sensors into their lives.</p><figure><img src="https://www.joshhorne.com/content/images/2022/02/Soli-Skip-Music-v7-Uncropped.2019-09-16-14_18_09.gif" alt="Person swiping above their phone to change music tracks." loading="lazy" width="800" height="450"/><figcaption>Pixel 4 touchless gestures using Soli (a bit more user-friendly than Zappos‚Äô sub-etha radio).

It anticipates our needs by understanding the context of our environment and situation. It serves us, rather than us serving it. This is what the next evolution in computing is all about. As smartphones untethered us from our desks, ambient computing aims to untether us from our smartphones.</p><div><p>mmWave radar is well-suited for ambient computing because it understands human context such as vital signs, gestures, and location while at the same time being non-invasive and privacy-preserving.</p></div><p>One of the key principles of ambient intelligence is that <em>value = functionality / attention required</em>.<sup>[</sup><a href="#digital-living-room"><sup>6</sup></a><sup>]</sup> mmWave radar, for example, can track my sleep without me having to wear anything and works silently in the background.
