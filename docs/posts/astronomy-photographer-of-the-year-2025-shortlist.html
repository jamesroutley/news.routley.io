The gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, dominate with their immense size and swirling storms, while Saturn’s rings make it especially striking.

Original data from NASA SDO 171, 193, 304 nanometre from 1 June 2024 </em></p><p><span>The data from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observer (SDO) probe was used here to show the Sun’s inner corona in a way that hints at a process similar to that which energises colourful neon lights on Earth. Images taken by the SDO in the ultraviolet spectrum were remapped to a more vibrant palette, with the same coronal data turned ‘inside out’ to surround the Sun, creating the illusion of it being enclosed in a neon tube. The data was then polar inversed to mirror the inner coronal image and colour saturation was increased.</span></p>
