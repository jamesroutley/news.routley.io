Week 11 of RC.</p><p><span title="2024-10-28 12:00:00 +0000 UTC">28 Oct 2024</span> · 6 min · Gianluca Truda</p></div><div><p>Find previous weeknotes <a href="https://gianluca.ai/tags/weeknotes/">here</a>.</p><hr/><p>It was a scattered and chaotic week for me, with RC drawing to a close and my attention being demanded from multiple directions at once. But amidst that chaos I wrote some good code, read some interesting articles, and discovered some fresh ideas. Enjoy!</p><hr/><h2 id="orbital-a-game-jam-work-in-progress">Orbital: A game-jam work in progress</h2><p>The big event of the week was my second Recurse game jam (I wrote about my first one <a href="https://gianluca.ai/rc-weeknotes-05/#jam-packed-a-claustrophobic-game-jam">here</a>).</p><p>A few of us set a theme — this time it was <code>Sp00ky</code> — and focussed as much time as we could over 3 days to working on our games, with blitz presentations to the whole of RC on Thursday.</p><p>I decided to mostly ignore the theme and double down on the space/orbit simulation I started <a href="https://gianluca.ai/2024-42/">last week</a>.</p><p>You can try the current release live in your browser at <a href="https://gianluca-orbital.vercel.app/">gianluca-orbital.vercel.app</a> or see the latest code at <a href="https://github.com/gianlucatruda/orbital">github.com/gianlucatruda/orbital</a></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://gianluca.ai/2024-43/images/orbital-pretty-moon.png" alt="Orbital: Moon closeup"/></p><p>The idea was to evolve it into a full-blown orbital manoeuvres game where you complete puzzles (e.g. get from planet A to planet B) under certain constraints (mission time, delta-v). As it progresses, you’d have to make increasing use of clever gravity assists to achieve the mission within the constraints.</p><p>Unfortunately, I did my usual trick of being overly ambitious in my scope and then overloading myself with other commitments. I ended up only really getting around 8 hours of work on the project and ran into a number of bugs as I transitioned to a physically-accurate model.</p><p>One of the rabbit holes I fell down was attempting to <a href="https://github.com/gianlucatruda/orbital/pull/1">migrate the physics engine to Rust with WASM bindings</a>. In principle, this isn’t the worst idea, but I was pretty confident I was going to add a ton of complexity to the build and deploy processes. I justified that by it being a good way to work on more Rust, avoid writing vector operations in JS, and try out WebAssembly compilation. But ultimately I realised that the interfacing between Rust-WASM and the JS frontend is a lot of additional work and fiddling that is precisely the wrong thing to be doing under time constraints and a rapidly-evolving experimental project.</p><p>The second rabbit hole was trying to switch from a toy solar system to <a href="https://github.com/gianlucatruda/orbital/pull/2">real-world physical accuracy</a>. I’m still ultimately going this direction, but it introduced a load of additional issues and subtle numerical instability bugs.</p><p>The crux is this: <strong>the solar system is really big and really empty, but orbits are really fast and really precise.</strong> This is not a happy path for 3D scene animation or for 32-bit floats. It’s also tricky to visualise. I’m still working on the fixes in my <code>dev</code> branch.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://gianluca.ai/2024-43/images/orbital-true-scale.png" alt="Orbital: true scale"/></p><p>Ultimately, I didn’t get to implementing any gameplay or even any spacecraft orbital physics (a whole separate system to the Keplerian orbital model used for the stable-orbit planets). But I did have a fun 3D simulation with camera and time controls to present to the rest of RC.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://gianluca.ai/2024-43/images/orbital-toy-scale.png" alt="Orbital: toy scale"/></p><h2 id="this-weeks-side-quests">This week’s side quests</h2><p>As part of adding too many additional constraints to my week, I also:</p><ul><li>Hybrid attended a two-day AI conference.</li><li>Joined the weekly <em>ML Paper Cuts</em> group session where we went deep on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) paper</a> and classifier-free guidance.</li><li>Completed and <a href="https://gianluca.ai/books">reviewed</a> both <a href="https://gianluca.ai/books/#2001-a-space-odyssey-1968">2001: A Space Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://gianluca.ai/books/#exhalation-2019">Exhalation</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/gianlucatruda/dotfiles/commit/7b22218a4280e8878c286a6d498d693d41dea081">Updated</a> my <code>.vimrc</code> based on a nice simple fallback config across <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivim/id1266544660">iVim</a> on my iPad and various terminals on my Mac and remote Linux machines.</li></ul><h2 id="ideas-to-hear">Ideas to hear</h2><h3 id="diffusion-is-autoregression-in-frequency-space">Diffusion is autoregression in frequency space</h3><p>I’ve been riffing on the connections between diffusion models (like DALL.E and midjourney) and autoregressive models (like all the LLMs) as a way to deepen my understanding of both paradigms.</p><p>Some rough notes:</p><ul><li>In autoregression, we mask one whole value/token/pixel at each step.</li><li>In denoising diffusion models (DDMs), we mask a bit of all values/tokens/pixels at each step.</li><li>Both autoregression and diffusion are about sequentially subtracting information and having a model learn to sequentially restore the information.</li><li>DDMs are autoregressors, but in the steps of the diffusion process</li><li>Diffusion models are autoregressive, but across noise levels rather than time steps</li></ul><p>Then Alexa from RC shared something that nudged this along:</p><blockquote><p>[Diffusion] is a soft version of autoregression in frequency space, or if you want to make it sound fancier, approximate spectral autoregression.</p></blockquote><p>— <a href="https://sander.ai/2024/09/02/spectral-autoregression.html">Diffusion is spectral autoregression</a></p><p>Now we’re cooking!

These structures break feedback loops, preventing those affected from influencing decisions or identifying who is responsible.</p><blockquote><p>Here’s an example: a higher up at a hospitality company decides to reduce the size of its cleaning staff, because it improves the numbers on a balance sheet somewhere. Later, you are trying to check into a room, but it’s not ready and the clerk can’t tell you when it will be; they can offer a voucher, but what you need is a room. There’s no one to call to complain, no way to communicate back to that distant leader that they’ve scotched your plans. The accountability is swallowed up into a void, lost forever.</p></blockquote><p>— <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/accountability-sinks">A Working Library: Accountability Sinks</a></p><h3 id="chollets-model-of-prompt-engineering">Chollet’s model of prompt engineering</h3><blockquote><p>If a LLM is like a database of millions of vector programs, then a prompt is like a search query in that database […] this “program database” is continuous and interpolative — it’s not a discrete set of programs. This means that a slightly different prompt, like “Lyrically rephrase this text in the style of x” would still have pointed to a very similar location in program space, resulting in a program that would behave pretty closely but not quite identically. […] Prompt engineering is the process of searching through program space to find the program that empirically seems to perform best on your target task.</p></blockquote><p>– <a href="https://fchollet.substack.com/p/how-i-think-about-llm-prompt-engineering">How I think about LLM prompt engineering</a> via <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/25/francois-chollet/">Simon Willison</a></p><h2 id="fun-links">Fun links</h2><ul><li>A superb article on software engineering and refactoring: <a href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to">Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend</a></li><li>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229">Apple paper that used clever tricks to see if LLMs can actually reason</a>.
