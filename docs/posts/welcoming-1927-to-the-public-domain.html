    <h1>Welcoming 1927 to the Public Domain</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>This year we are welcoming works from 1927 into the public domain in the United States, including <a href="https://archive.org/details/books?query=date%3A%5B%2A+TO+1927%5D&amp;sort=-date">books</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/periodicals?query=date%3A%5B%2A+TO+1927%5D&amp;sort=-date">periodicals</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22sheet+music%22+AND+mediatype%3Atexts+AND+date%3A%5B%2A+TO+1927%5D&amp;sort=-date">sheet music</a>, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/feature_films?query=date%3A%5B%2A+TO+1927%5D&amp;sort=-date">movies</a>. </p>



<p>Big events of 1927 include the first transatlantic phone call from New York to London, the formation of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the first successful long distance demonstration of television, the release of the first popular “talkie,” <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-jazz-singer_1927">The Jazz Singer</a>, and the first nonstop transatlantic solo airplane flight, from New York to Paris, by Charles Lindbergh.</p>



<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>



<p>Despite the popularity of The Jazz Singer, movies were still mostly silent in 1927, including the gorgeous <a href="https://archive.org/details/metropolis_fritz-lang_1927">Metropolis</a> by Fritz Lang. Laurel and Hardy’s first film, <a href="https://archive.org/details/putting-pants-on-philip_1927">Putting Pants on Phillip</a>, was released that year, along with an early Gary Cooper Western, <a href="https://archive.org/details/nevada_1927">Nevada</a>, Joan Crawford in <a href="https://archive.org/details/spring-fever_1927">Spring Fever</a>, Mary Pickford in <a href="https://archive.org/details/my-best-girl_1927">My Best Girl</a>, Clara Bow in <a href="https://archive.org/details/get-your-man_1927">Get Your Man</a>, and Cecil B. DeMille’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-king-of-kings_1927">King of Kings</a>.</p>



<p>I was particularly taken with <a href="https://archive.org/details/no-mans-law_1927">No Man’s Land</a>, which gives top billing to a horse (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_the_King_of_Wild_Horses">Rex the Wonder Horse</a>, in case you were wondering – if you’d like to follow his career he also starred in <a href="https://archive.org/details/silent-the-king-of-wild-horses">The King of Wild Horses</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/silent-black-cyclone">Black Cyclone</a>). </p>



<p>Or we can time travel with Koko the Clown in <a href="https://archive.org/details/koko-in-1999_1927">Koko in 1999</a> where they apparently thought that at the turn of the last century everything would happen via automation and you’d get a wife from a vending machine for 25 cents.  </p>

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>



<p>No new recorded music enters the public domain in the US this year — the next group of recorded music becomes available in 4 years, due to how the music modernization act is written — but we do have some fun new <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22sheet+music%22+AND+mediatype%3Atexts+AND+date%3A%5B%2A+TO+1927%5D&amp;sort=-date">sheet music</a> to explore. The biggies that are most remembered today are probably <a href="https://archive.org/details/bestthingsinlife00june">The Best Things in Life Are Free</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/iscreamyouscream00howa">I Scream, You Scream, We All Scream For Ice Cream</a>.
