The Onion’s bid was backed by the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting, who in 2022 won a $1.4 billion defamation lawsuit against Mr. Jones. </p><p>Mr. Jones spent years claiming that the 2012 school shooting was a hoax and that victims’ family members were actors complicit in the plot. The Onion has said that it wants to turn Infowars into a satirical site mocking the kind of conspiracy theories that Mr. Jones spreads.</p><p>Ben Collins, the chief executive of The Onion’s parent company, said the publication was “deeply disappointed” by Tuesday’s decision.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He added that The Onion would “continue to seek a resolution that helps the Sandy Hook families receive a positive outcome for the horror they endured,” adding that the company would continue its pursuit of Infowars in the coming weeks.</p><p>Chris Mattei, an attorney for the Sandy Hook families, said that his clients, too, were disappointed.</p><p>“These families, who have already persevered through countless delays and roadblocks, remain resilient and determined as ever to hold Alex Jones and his corrupt businesses accountable for the harm he has caused,” Mr. Mattei’s statement said. “This decision doesn’t change the fact that, soon, Alex Jones will begin to pay his debt to these families and he will continue doing so for as long as it takes.”</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Jones did not respond to an email seeking comment. </p><p>Judge Lopez’s ruling put the fate of Infowars in limbo, instructing a court-appointed trustee to come up with an alternative resolution. It was not immediately clear what approach the trustee, Christopher Murray, would take. Mr. Murray did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Judge Lopez said that the bankruptcy auction failed to maximize the amount of money that the sale of Infowars should provide to Mr. Jones’s creditors, including the Sandy Hook families, in part because the bids were submitted in secret. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It seemed doomed almost from the moment they decided to go to a sealed bid,” Judge Lopez said. “Nobody knows what anybody else is bidding,” he added.</p><p>Though the case involved colorful litigants dueling for a controversial prize, it ultimately hinged on austere matters of protocol. The arguments over two days of court hearings boiled down to whether Mr. Murray, the trustee, adhered to the law when he solicited bids and ultimately picked Global Tetrahedron, The Onion’s parent company, as the winner.</p><p>The total value of The Onion’s bid was $7 million, including $1.75 million in cash put up by Global Tetrahedron, with the rest coming from the families of the Sandy Hook shooting victims, who essentially opted to put a portion of their potential earnings from a defamation judgment against Mr. Jones toward The Onion’s bid.</p><p>The hearing began on Monday with opening arguments from lawyers representing Global Tetrahedron, and First United American Companies, a bidder affiliated with Mr. Jones. Much of the back-and-forth was focused on whether the court should allow families of the Sandy Hook victims to apply a portion of their judgment against Mr. Jones to The Onion’s bid.</p><p>Not including the backing of the Sandy Hook families, First United American Companies had a higher bid, offering $3.5 million in cash. But Jeff Tanenbaum, an expert who advised the court-appointee trustee on the sale, said that the combined bid with the Sandy Hook families was superior.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>As the drama played out in court, Mr. Jones hosted on X what he billed as the “final Infowars broadcast ever,” inaccurately telling viewers that the company was being sold to the billionaire Michael Bloomberg. He criticized the bankruptcy trustee’s process as an “Alice in Wonderland-level bizarroland.”</p><p>Before the hearing, Mr. Jones argued in a filing that the Sandy Hook families and Global Tetrahedron had improperly colluded on their bid, making “a mockery of a fair and transparent auction and bidding process.” </p><p>Although the hearing started off in decorous fashion, it got increasingly heated. At one point, a lawyer for the bidder associated with Mr. Jones questioned how the Sandy Hook families could afford “all these lawyers,” a remark that drew immediate objections.</p><p>In his remarks, Judge Lopez acknowledged that the sale of Infowars involved “lots of emotion” from supporters of The Onion and fans of Mr. Jones. He concluded that — despite some “good-faith errors” — neither side did “anything wrong here.” </p><p>“You’ve got to scratch and claw and get everything you can for everyone else,” he said.</p><p>Alain Delaqueriere and Kitty Bennett contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elizabeth Williamson is a feature writer for The Times, based in Washington.
