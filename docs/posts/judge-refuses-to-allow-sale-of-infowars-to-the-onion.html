founded by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, to the Chicago-based satirical publication The Onion, prolonging a messy tug of war between two high-profile suitors.</p><p>The ruling, by Judge Christopher M. Lopez in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, poses a roadblock for The Onion’s plan to take possession of the Infowars site and its associated assets after it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/business/media/alex-jones-infowars-the-onion.html" title="">won an auction last month</a>. The Onion’s bid was backed by the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting, who in 2022 won a $1.4 billion defamation lawsuit against Mr. Jones.</p><p>Mr. Jones spent years claiming that the 2012 school shooting was a hoax and that victims’ family members were actors complicit in the plot. The Onion has said that it wants to turn Infowars into a satirical site mocking the kind of conspiracy theories that Mr. Jones spreads.</p><p>Judge Lopez’s ruling put the fate of Infowars in limbo. He instructed a court-appointed trustee, Christopher Murray, to come up with an alternative resolution, though it was not immediately clear what approach Mr. Murray would take. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ben Collins, the chief executive of Global Tetrahedron, The Onion’s parent company, said the publication was “deeply disappointed” by Tuesday’s decision.</p><p>He added that The Onion would “continue to seek a resolution that helps the Sandy Hook families receive a positive outcome for the horror they endured,” adding that the company would continue its pursuit of Infowars in the coming weeks.</p><p>Chris Mattei, an attorney for the Sandy Hook families, said that his clients, too, were disappointed.</p><p>“These families, who have already persevered through countless delays and roadblocks, remain resilient and determined as ever to hold Alex Jones and his corrupt businesses accountable for the harm he has caused,” Mr. Mattei said.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Jones did not respond to an email seeking comment. In a video broadcast on X, Mr. Jones said, “Finally, a judge followed the law.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I’m not a litigious person, but they’re trying to destroy us and destroy free speech, so you know what’s going to happen to them,” he added. He suggested that the groups involved with Onion bid colluded to rig their bid and would be investigated by the Justice Department.</p><p>Judge Lopez said that the bankruptcy auction failed to maximize the amount of money that the sale of Infowars should provide to Mr. Jones’s creditors, including the Sandy Hook families, in part because the bids were submitted in secret.</p><p>“It seemed doomed almost from the moment they decided to go to a sealed bid,” Judge Lopez said. “Nobody knows what anybody else is bidding,” he added.</p><p>The case ultimately hinged on austere matters of protocol. The arguments over two days of hearings boiled down to whether Mr. Murray, the trustee, adhered to the law when he solicited bids and ultimately picked The Onion’s parent company as the winner.</p><p>The total value of The Onion’s bid was $7 million, including $1.75 million in cash put up by its parent company, with the rest coming from the families of the Sandy Hook shooting victims, who essentially opted to put a portion of their potential earnings from a defamation judgment against Mr. Jones toward The Onion’s bid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The hearing began on Monday with opening arguments from lawyers representing Global Tetrahedron and First United American Companies, a bidder affiliated with Mr. Jones. Much of the back-and-forth was focused on whether the Sandy Hook victims could apply their partial judgment to The Onion’s bid.</p><p>Not including the backing of the Sandy Hook families, First United American Companies had a higher bid, offering $3.5 million in cash. But Jeff Tanenbaum, an expert who advised the court-appointee trustee on the sale, said that the combined bid with the Sandy Hook families was superior.</p><p>Before the hearing, Mr. Jones argued in a filing that the Sandy Hook families and Global Tetrahedron had improperly colluded on their bid, making “a mockery of a fair and transparent auction and bidding process.”</p><p>As the drama played out in court, Mr. Jones billed his broadcast on X as the “final Infowars broadcast ever,” inaccurately telling viewers that the company was being sold to the billionaire Michael Bloomberg. He criticized the bankruptcy trustee’s process as an “Alice in Wonderland-level bizarroland.”</p><p>Although the hearing started off in decorous fashion, it got increasingly heated. At one point, a lawyer for the bidder associated with Mr. Jones questioned how the Sandy Hook families could afford “all these lawyers,” a remark that drew immediate objections.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In his remarks, Judge Lopez acknowledged that the case involved “lots of emotion” from supporters of The Onion and fans of Mr. Jones. He concluded that — despite some “good-faith errors” — neither side did “anything wrong here.”</p><p>“You’ve got to scratch and claw and get everything you can for everyone else,” he said.</p><p>Alain Delaqueriere and Kitty Bennett contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Mullin reports on the major companies behind news and entertainment.
