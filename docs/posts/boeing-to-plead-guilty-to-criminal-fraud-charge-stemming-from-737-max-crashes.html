    <h1>Boeing to plead guilty to criminal fraud charge stemming from 737 MAX crashes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="RegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-2" data-analytics="RegularArticle-articleBody-5-2"><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-105786668" data-test="InlineImage"><div><div><p>Rescuers work at the scene of an Ethiopian Airlines flight crash near Bishoftu, or Debre Zeit, south of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Monday, March 11, 2019.</p><p>Mulugeta Ayene | Reuters</p></div></div></div><div><p><span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-1"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BA/">Boeing</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> has agreed to plead guilty to criminal fraud tied to the fatal 737 Max crashes, a decision that brands the U.S. aerospace giant a felon but allows it to avoid a trial while it tries to turn the page from safety and manufacturing crises.</p><p>Under the deal, Boeing would face a fine of up to $487.2 million, though the Justice Department recommended that the court credit Boeing $243.6 million it paid under a previous agreement. So the new fine would be $243.6 million.</p><p>If the deal is accepted, it could complicate Boeing&#39;s ability to sell products to the U.S. government as a felon, though the company could seek waivers.<strong> </strong>About 32% of Boeing&#39;s nearly $78 billion in revenue last year came from its defense, space and security unit.</p><p>The Justice Department unveiled the deal late Sunday, months after U.S. prosecutors said the aerospace giant violated a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/doj-fines-boeing-over-2point5-billion-charges-it-with-fraud-conspiracy-over-737-max-crashes.html">2021 settlement</a> that shielded it from prosecution for three years.</p><p>An independent compliance monitor would also be installed to oversee compliance at Boeing for three years during a probationary period. Boeing would also have to invest at least $455 million in compliance and safety programs, according to a U.S. prosecutors&#39; court filing late Sunday. The plea deal requires the approval of a federal judge to take effect.</p><p>Boeing also agreed for its board of directors to meet with crash victims&#39; family members.</p><p>The plea deal offer forced Boeing to decide between a guilty plea and the attached terms, or going to trial, just as the company was seeking to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/23/boeing-cfo-deliveries-cash-flow-max-crisis.html">turn a corner</a> in its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/boeing-faa-safety-plan.html">manufacturing and safety crises</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-board-chair-commercial-head-out-737-max-crisis.html">pick a new CEO</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/boeing-to-buy-spirit-aerosystems.html">acquire</a> its fuselage maker, <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-7"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SPR/">Spirit AeroSystems</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>.</p><p>&#34;We can confirm that we have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department, subject to the memorialization and approval of specific terms,&#34; Boeing said in a statement.</p><p>In May, the Justice Department said Boeing had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/justice-department-says-boeing-breached-2021-agreement-that-shielded-it-from-criminal-charges-over-737-max-crashes.html">violated the 2021 agreement</a>. Under that deferred prosecution agreement, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion, including an original $243.6 million criminal fine, compensation to airlines and a $500 million fund for victims&#39; family members.</p><p>That 2021 settlement was set to expire two days after a door panel blew out of a nearly new 737 Max 9 operated by <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-9"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ALK/">Alaska Airlines</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> on Jan. 5. While there were no serious injuries, the accident created a fresh safety crisis for Boeing.</p><p>The U.S. accused Boeing of conspiracy to defraud the government by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/09/boeing-releases-communications-on-737-max-simulators-it-calls-completely-unacceptable.html">misleading regulators</a> about its inclusion of a flight-control system on the Max that was later implicated in the two Max crashes â€” a Lion Air flight in October 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. All 346 people on board the flights were killed.</p><p>U.S. prosecutors had told victims&#39; family members on June 30 that they <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/us-seeks-guilty-plea-from-boeing-over-737-max-crashes.html">planned to seek a guilty plea from Boeing</a>, a plan family attorneys called &#34;a sweetheart deal.&#34;</p><p>Paul Cassell, a lawyer for victims&#39; family members, said he plans to ask the federal judge on the case to reject the deal and &#34;simply set the matter for a public trial, so that all the facts surrounding the case will be aired in a fair and open forum before a jury.&#34;</p></div><div role="region" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107396835"><div role="button" tabindex="0" id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107396835" data-vilynx-id="7000336413" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder"><div id="InlineVideo-0" data-test="InlineVideo"><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107397085-1712261316858-GettyImages-1241993909.jpeg?v=1715779349&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Why the Boeing 737 Max has been such a mess"/><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
