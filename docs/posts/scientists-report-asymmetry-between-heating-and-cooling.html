</div><p>A new study led by scientists from Spain and Germany has found a fundamental asymmetry showing that heating is consistently faster than cooling, challenging conventional expectations and introducing the concept of &#34;thermal kinematics&#34; to explain this phenomenon. The findings are published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-023-02269-z"><i>Nature Physics</i></a>.</p>

										 											  <p>Traditionally, heating and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/cooling/" rel="tag">cooling</a>, fundamental processes in thermodynamics, have been perceived as symmetric, following similar pathways.</p>
<p>On a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/microscopic+level/" rel="tag">microscopic level</a>, heating involves injecting energy into individual particles, intensifying their motion. On the other hand, cooling entails the release of energy, dampening their motion. However, one question has always remained: Why is heating more efficient than cooling?</p>
<p>To answer this questions, researchers led by Associate Prof. Raúl A. Rica Alarcón from the Universidad de Granada in Spain and Dr. Aljaz Godec from the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences in Germany have introduced a new framework: thermal kinematics.</p>
<p>Speaking of their motivation behind exploring such a fundamental topic, Prof. Alarcón told Phys.org, &#34;Since childhood, I&#39;ve been intrigued by why heating is more efficient than cooling. And have questions like: &#39;Why don&#39;t we have a device like a microwave oven for fast cooling?&#39;&#34;</p>
<p>Dr. Godec added, &#34;Thermal relaxation phenomena have always been a big research topic in the group (these are hard problems in non-equilibrium physics). However, specific questions about the heating and cooling asymmetry were initially provoked by mathematical intuition. We did not expect the answer to be so striking.&#34;</p>


											  													    
											  
											  <h2>Processes at microscopic scales</h2>
<p>At the microscopic level, heating and cooling are processes involving the exchange and redistribution of energy among individual particles within a system.</p>
<p>In the context of the recent research, the focus is on understanding the dynamics of microscopic systems undergoing thermal relaxation—how these systems evolve when subjected to <a href="https://phys.org/tags/temperature/" rel="tag">temperature</a> changes.</p>
<p>In heating, energy is injected into each particle of a system, leading to an intensification of the particles&#39; motion. This causes them to move more vigorously. The higher the temperature, the more intense the Brownian (or random) motion of these particles due to increased collisions with surrounding water molecules.</p>
<p>On the other hand, cooling at the microscopic level involves the release of energy from individual particles, resulting in a dampening of their motion. This process corresponds to the system losing energy, leading to a decrease in the intensity of particle movement.</p>
<p>&#34;Our work is devoted to the analysis of the evolution of a microscopic system after it is driven far from equilibrium. We consider the thermalization of a microscopic system, i.e., how a system at a given temperature evolves to the temperature of a thermal bath it is put in contact with,&#34; explained Dr. Godec.</p>
<p>Prof. Alarcón. further explained, &#34;A clear example would be taking an object from a boiling-water bath (at 100 degrees Celsius) and immersing it in a mixture of water and ice (at 0 degrees Celsius).&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We compare how fast the system equilibrates with the reverse protocol when the object is initially in the cold bath and heated in boiling water. We observe that, at the microscale, heating is faster than cooling, and we explain this theoretically by developing a new framework we call thermal kinematics.&#34;</p>
