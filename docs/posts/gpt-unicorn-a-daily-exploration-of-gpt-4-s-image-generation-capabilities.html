    <h1>GPT Unicorn: A Daily Exploration of GPT-4&#39;s Image Generation Capabilities</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>The idea behind GPT Unicorn is quite simple: every day, GPT-4 will be asked to draw a unicorn in SVG format. This daily interaction with the model will allow us to observe changes in the model over time, as reflected in the output.</p>
<p>Why unicorns? Well, the inspiration comes from the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12712.pdf">Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4</a> by SÃ©bastien Bubeck and others, in which they use the prompt &#34;Draw a unicorn in TiKZ&#34; to compare unicorn drawings and note how fine-tuning the GPT-4 model for safety caused the image quality to deteriorate.</p>
<p>By using SVG instead of TiKZ, I hope to see a similar evolution in the sophistication of GPT-4&#39;s drawings as the system is refined.</p>
<p>You can find the daily images on the <a href="https://gpt-unicorn.adamkdean.co.uk">GPT Unicorn</a> project site and find the code on <a href="https://github.com/adamkdean/gpt-unicorn">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tracking-progress-and-understanding-gpt-4">Tracking Progress and Understanding GPT-4</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, one of the primary objectives of GPT Unicorn is to track the progress and development of GPT-4. By generating a new unicorn drawing every day, we can observe how the model evolves and improves over time, offering unique insights into its capabilities.</p>
<p>But GPT Unicorn is more than just a fun experiment; it also serves as an informal evaluation of GPT-4&#39;s intelligence. By continuously asking GPT-4 to perform a specific, challenging task, we can gauge its ability to understand and connect topics, as well as perform tasks that go beyond the typical scope of narrow AI systems.</p>
<h2 id="image-generation-and-language-models">Image Generation and Language Models</h2>
<p>GPT Unicorn not only serves as an interesting exploration of GPT-4&#39;s image generation capabilities but also highlights how these capabilities fit into the broader evaluation of language models. By generating images daily, we can assess GPT-4&#39;s ability to understand and process visual information, as well as its ability to connect the dots between language and visual representation. This adds another layer to our understanding of the model&#39;s capabilities, taking us a step closer to unraveling the intricacies of artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>To view the daily generated unicorn images and browse the archive of previous drawings, head over to <a href="https://gpt-unicorn.adamkdean.co.uk">GPT Unicorn</a>. You&#39;ll be able to witness GPT-4&#39;s progress firsthand and join me in tracking the evolution of this fascinating AI model.</p>
<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<p>Day 1-3: Not a great start, initial images looking rather unrecognisable:</p>

<p>Day 4: Interesting shapes start to emerge, we can see the eyes, the general shape, the head, and crucially, a horn:</p>
