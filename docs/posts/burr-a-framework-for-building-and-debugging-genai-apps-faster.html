  <p>Let \(H &gt; \mathbb{Nat}\) be unlimited.</p>

<p>Then the linear map \(T(x: \mathbb{R}^*): \mathbb{R}^* := Hx\) is discontinuous.
Why, its discontinuity is equivalent to it being unbounded. This holds in general, but this example is the germ of generality.</p>

<p>See my <a href="http://alok.github.io/2024/03/29/continuous-vs-bounded/">previous post</a> for definitions of bounded and continuous.</p>

<p>The map \(T\) is unbounded since it maps \(1\) and \(2\) to \(H\) and \(2H\), which are \(H\) apart, an unlimited distance. It is also not continuous since \(\frac{1}{H}\) is infinitely close to \(\frac{2}{H}\), but \(T(\frac{1}{H}) = 1\) is not infinitely close to \(T(\frac{2}{H}) = 2\).</p>

<p>However, if \(H\) was limited, then \(T\) would be continuous. The scaling of \(H\) would be bounded, and infinitely close points would stay infinitely close, AKA \(T\) is continuous.</p>

<h2 id="for-experts-and-the-pathologically-curious">For experts and the pathologically curious</h2>

<p>Existence of discontinuous linear maps on complete spaces is equivalent to forms of the Axiom of Choice. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuous_linear_map#Role_of_the_axiom_of_choice">wiki</a> covers it more. From our radically elementary perspective, the issue is that H is an external object. One way of defining it as a sequence under the hood is <code>H = [1, 2, 3, ..]</code>. Its unassignablility (as Leibniz called it) is where the issue lies.</p>
