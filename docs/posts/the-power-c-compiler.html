<p>Power C is an ANSI compatible C compiler for DOS that requires very few
resources. It can be installed in less than 1 Meg of disk space and will run on
any PC that runs DOS 2.0 or later. It is compatible with CPUs from the 8088
through the latest Pentiums®. Power C combines high-performance software
with superb documentation, all for less than the price of most C books alone.
It&#39;s your fast route to fast programs without the fast bucks. </p>

<p>The quality of the Power C documentation makes it easier to learn C. The
manuals (if any) that accompany our competitor&#39;s products are terse at best.
They contain little or no information about C, and very few examples. In
contrast, the Power C book includes a step-by-step tutorial and is chock-full
of example programs. Many of our customers say that it&#39;s the best C book
they&#39;ve ever used. </p>

<p>The quantity of functions in the Power C library makes it easier to
accomplish your programming tasks. The Power C library contains more than 420
functions, a superset of the functions in Microsoft C 4.0 and Turbo C 1.0. In
addition, Power C includes a large number of video and graphics functions. You
get super-fast functions for drawing lines, boxes, circles, ellipses, pie
charts, and more. </p>

<p>The speed of the Power C compiler makes programming fast. Power C&#39;s
integrated MAKE utility saves you time and effort by automatically managing
your large programming projects. If you modify your program, Power C makes a
new version by recompiling only the files that have changed. The compiled
programs are equally fast. Just check out the performance chart. See how much
time and money you save with Power C. </p>

<h2>Optional Products</h2>



<h3><!--[if !supportLists]--><span><span>·<span>        
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Library Source Code</h3>

<p>The Library Source Code includes the Power C
assembler, the Power C library manager, and all the C and assembly language
source code for the Power C function libraries. The Library Source Code is
useful for examining, changing, or extending the operation of one or more of
the library functions. The Power C assembler may be used as an alternative to
Microsoft&#39;s assembler for writing functions in assembly language. </p>

<h3><!--[if !supportLists]--><span><span>·<span>        
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->BCD Business Math</h3>

<p>The BCD Business Math library includes binary coded
decimal floating point routines and financial functions for calculating the
time value of money, depreciation, etc... The IEEE floating point routines
supplied with Power C are best suited for scientific calculations, whereas the
BCD floating point routines are best suited for financial calculations. The BCD
routines eliminate inaccuracies caused by rounding. </p>
