    <h1>Microsoft starts testing ads in the Windows 11 Start menu</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Microsoft says it’s starting to test ads inside the Start menu on Windows 11. The software maker will use the Recommended section of the Start menu, which usually shows file recommendations, to suggest apps from the Microsoft Store.  </p><p>“This will appear only for Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel in the US and will not apply to commercial devices (devices managed by organizations),” says <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/04/12/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22635-3495-beta-channel/">Microsoft in a blog post</a>. </p><p>The app promotions can be disabled in the Settings section of Windows 11, but it appears that Microsoft will enable these by default. Microsoft is seeking feedback on the changes, so it’s possible the company could decide to ditch these ads in development builds of Windows 11 if there’s enough feedback that suggests they’re not going to be a popular addition.</p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="An image of the Windows 11 start menu. 1Password is highlighted with a red box indicating that it is an ad and not currently installed." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div><div><figcaption><em>The ad is the one Microsoft highlighted with a red box.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div></div></div><p>Microsoft started testing <a href="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/2022/3/15/22979251/microsoft-file-explorer-ads-windows-11-testing">ads inside the File Explorer of Windows 11</a> last year before disabling the experiment in beta versions of Windows 11. Microsoft has been experimenting with ads inside Windows for more than 10 years. There are already promotional spots <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/29/8514345/windows-spotlight-lock-screen-with-ads">on the Windows 10 lock screen</a> and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/16/11682164/microsoft-windows-10-promoted-apps-start-menu-anniversary-update">in the Start menu</a>, so it’s not exactly surprising to see them appear in Windows 11, too. </p><p>Now, it’s up to Windows testers to file feedback on these changes to see whether Microsoft might be forced to not include these ads on shipping versions of Windows 11. </p></div></div></div>
