<p><b>Update 4-8-2024:</b> 
Should any readers want to learn how to do what I do (estimating
performance of launch rockets or other space vehicles),   be aware that I have created a series of
short courses in how to go about these analyses,  complete with effective tools for actually
carrying it out.  These course materials are
available for free from a drop box that can be accessed from the Mars Society’s
“New Mars” forums,  located at <a href="http://newmars.com/forums/">http://newmars.com/forums/</a>,  in the “Acheron labs” section,  “interplanetary transportation” topic,  and conversation thread titled “orbital
mechanics class traditional”.  You may
have scroll down past all the “sticky notes”. 
<o:p></o:p></p><p>The first posting in that thread has a list of the classes
available,  and these go far beyond just the
two-body elementary orbital mechanics of ellipses.  There are the empirical corrections for
losses to be covered,  approaches to use
for estimating entry descent and landing on bodies with atmospheres,  and spreadsheet-based tools for estimating
the performance of rocket engines and rocket vehicles.  The same thread has links to all the materials
in the drop box.  <o:p></o:p></p><p>The New Mars forums would also welcome your
participation.  Send an email to <a href="mailto:newmarsmember@gmail.com">newmarsmember@gmail.com</a> to find out
how to join up. <o:p></o:p></p><p>A lot of the same information from those short courses is
available scattered among the postings here. 
There is a sort of “technical catalog” article that I try to main
current.  It is titled “Lists of Some
Articles by Topic Area”,  posted 21
October 2021.  There are categories for
ramjet and closely-related, 
aerothermodynamics and heat transfer, 
rocket ballistics and rocket vehicle performance articles (<u>of
specific interest here</u>),  asteroid
defense articles,  space suits and
atmospheres articles,  radiation hazard
articles,  pulsejet articles,  articles about ethanol and ethanol blends in
vehicles,  automotive care articles,  articles related to cactus eradication,  and articles related to towed decoys.  All of these are things that I really
did.  <o:p></o:p></p><p>To access quickly any article on this site,  use the blog archive tool on the left.  All you need is the posting date and the
title.  Click on the year,  then click on the month,  then click on the title if need be (such as if
multiple articles were posted that month). 
Visit the catalog article and just jot down those you want to go see. <o:p></o:p></p><p>Within any article, 
you can see the figures enlarged,  by the expedient of just clicking on a
figure.  You can scroll through all the
figures at greatest resolution in an article that way,  although the figure numbers and titles are
lacking.  There is an “X-out” top right
that takes you right back to the article itself.  <o:p></o:p></p><p>----------     <o:p></o:p></p><p><span><b><u>Update 10-29-2023</u>:</b>  recently,  I have received &#34;comments&#34; on this article that are nothing but ad solicitations from the makers of O-ring products,  usually from overseas.  They picked this article precisely because it mentions O-rings,  which tells me this was the result of a keyword search of published articles on the internet.  My blog site is not a monetized,  commercial site.  I do not accept any advertising from anyone.  When I find them,  I delete them.</span></p><p>-------</p><p>I have real difficulty with the fact that,  even after all these years,  it is still necessary to explain to people
what really destroyed Space Shuttle Challenger and killed her crew,  back in January 1986.  It was really two very seriously-bad upper
management decisions at NASA,  one long
before the launch: </p>

<p>(1) to insist on poorly-designing the O-ring seal joints with
3 interacting serious errors,<span>  </span>and <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>(2) to fly soaked-out colder than had ever been tested, <span> </span>when everybody’s engineers did not want to. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p><b>Background<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>First,<span>  </span>you have to
understand what really happens in federal government contracting.<span>  </span>There is only one customer,<span>  </span>and <u>he thinks he is always right about
every decision that he makes</u>.<span>  </span>If you
do not do it exactly the way he wants,<span>  </span><u>no
matter how wrong he might be</u>,<span>  </span>then
you lose the contract and you don’t get paid.<span> 
</span><b><i>And,<span>  </span>the government is
quite often wrong about how best to do things!</i></b><span>  </span>That’s not to say the contractors are always
right,<span>  </span>but they are wrong a lot less
often than the government. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>You also have to understand that NASA never did know,<span>  </span>and <u>still</u> does <u>not</u> know, <span> </span>the art of building reliable solid propellant
rockets.<span>  </span>Essentially, <span> </span>no one at NASA ever did that kind of
work.<span>  </span>They buy these things from
contractors who (by definition) know much more of the science, <span> </span><u>and especially the art</u>, <span> </span>than anyone at NASA knows.<span>  </span>The “science” is that knowledge which was written
down.<span>  </span>The “art” is the knowledge that
was <u>not</u> written down,<span>  </span>usually because
no one wanted to pay for the writing.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>I can tell you <u>from experience as an insider within the
business</u>, <span> </span>that “rocket science”
isn’t really “science”!<span>  </span>It is only about
40% science,<span>  </span>about 50% art,<span>  </span>and about 10% blind dumb luck.<span>  </span>And that’s in production work!<span>  </span>In new product development work,<span>  </span>the art and luck percentages are even
higher.<span>  </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Further,<span>  </span>this same
sentiment applies to pretty much any type of engineering effort,<span>  </span>not just rocket work.<span>  </span>That explains a lot,<span>  </span>about a lot of things, <span> </span>doesn’t it?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p><b>Poorly-Designed O-Ring Seal Joints<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>What I show in <b>Figure 1</b> is <u>how such joints should
be designed and built</u>.<span>  </span>This is the
design that most solid rocket motors use, <span> </span>very successfully,<span>  </span>whether large or small.<span>  </span>In most rocket motors,<span>  </span>you need only join the aft and forward
closures to the case cylinder.<span>  </span>Only in some
of the really large motors,<span>  </span>the case
cylinder itself is divided into segments that must be joined,<span>  </span>usually to limit the size of the case-bonded propellant
masses that must be cast and cured within them. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The sketch in the figure is what mechanical engineers call a
“radial static seal”.<span>  </span>It is “radial”
because the O-ring lies between an inner and an outer surface,<span>  </span>that must include a gap of tightly-controlled
size between the two parts,<span>  </span>for
assembly.<span>  </span>One part stabs into/inside the
other,<span>  </span>in order to join them,<span>  </span>in this case by a row of pins.<span>  </span>It is “static”,<span>  </span>because the parts,<span>  </span>once joined,<span> 
</span>do not move anymore.<span>  </span>There are
strict but well-published guidelines and procedures for sizing the O-ring
groove dimensions,<span>  </span>the gap for
assembly,<span>  </span>and the size of the
O-ring,<span>  </span>as well as its material
composition and its hardness.<span>  </span>These
guidelines and procedures are used precisely because they work so very
well.<span>   </span>Examples:<span>  </span><b>Refs. 1 and 2.</b><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Something also shown in the figure is peculiar to solid
rocket motors,<span>  </span>especially those that are
segmented-case designs.<span>  </span>There is a joint
in the insulation (and thus also the propellant) that leads to the sealing
surface gap, <span> </span>that in turn leads directly
to the O-ring in its groove.<span>  </span><b><i>You <u>DO
NOT obstruct</u> this path with sealants,<span> 
</span>putties,<span>  </span>greases,<span>  </span>or anything else!<span>  </span></i></b>But there does need to be a
right-angle bend,<span>  </span>to stop radiant heat transfer
from the flame in the motor from heating the O-ring directly. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The air in this path is what gets suddenly compressed upon
motor pressurization,<span>  </span>and which in turn
forces the O-ring to the far side of its groove,<span>  </span>where it gets squeezed against that surface
to seal.<span>  </span>This is called “seating the
O-ring”,<span>  </span>and until it is properly seated,<span>  </span>it CANNOT seal,<span>  </span>and so it briefly leaks!<o:p></o:p></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgy3G06GH8JoAli9mSuLMYWEs_XSnlRMONXhTkLZcoP3lR8-blQHj6nixYc3cdejlmtaeaT0S_YSJYKjvfVFCwbt_KCYqUjp-spbow1OApR5tM2Wh2ZjaiVyYLRLwBvgkwMSbwb-O09NEMy/s1153/F1+SRB+O+ring+joint+1.png"><img data-original-height="621" data-original-width="1153" height="215" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgy3G06GH8JoAli9mSuLMYWEs_XSnlRMONXhTkLZcoP3lR8-blQHj6nixYc3cdejlmtaeaT0S_YSJYKjvfVFCwbt_KCYqUjp-spbow1OApR5tM2Wh2ZjaiVyYLRLwBvgkwMSbwb-O09NEMy/w400-h215/F1+SRB+O+ring+joint+1.png" width="400"/></a></p><p><b>Figure 1 – A Properly Designed O-Ring Seal Joint<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>It is the air in the path that gets compressed against the
O-ring,  with hot booster gases and hot
solids filling most of the path volume that the air formerly occupied.  But the air cools by convection to the steel
much more effectively and faster than to the O-ring itself.  THAT is how the O-ring is not damaged by the hot
air,  or the hot gases!  The hot solids are stopped by the right-angle
bend.  This is a rapid transient on a
time scale equal to,  or shorter than,  the motor pressurization event.  <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>What you <u>DO NOT want</u> is contact of the hot gases (and
especially the hot solids) upon the O-ring! 
The “hot sandblast” effect of that outcome would cut through the O-ring almost
instantaneously.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Note that these two design requirements of (1) one O-ring
and (2) an unobstructed pressurization path, 
will interact very strongly with how one verifies proper assembly of the
motor!  You <u>must</u> do a pressure
leak check of the motor to verify sealing, 
but you <u>must do it by pressurizing the entire motor</u>!  <b><i>However,  you <u>NEED NOT pressurize the motor to its
full operating pressure</u> to do this verification!  <o:p></o:p></i></b></p>

<p>You only need an atmosphere or so of pressure difference to
seat any O-ring and then verify its sealing. 
If it holds at that low pressure, 
<u>and you followed the design guidelines correctly</u>,  it will hold at full motor operating pressure!  <b><i><u>THAT</u> is what you verify when you
do motor case hydroburst testing,  long
before you ever cast propellant to make a live motor!</i></b>  That’s the way the real solid rocket motor
manufacturers prefer to do it.  And it
works to very high reliability levels, 
as indicated in the figure. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>However,  <u>that is
NOT what NASA insisted upon doing</u>! 
In the <u>mistaken belief</u> that a second back-up O-ring increases
sealing reliability,  they insisted upon
the two O-ring design indicated in <b>Figure 2</b>.  Thiokol complied,  lest they lose the contract.  In the <u>mistaken belief</u> that they had
to pressure leak check at full motor operating pressure,  NASA did not want to risk fully pressurizing
a live loaded motor (and rightly so).  And
so NASA insisted on a way to apply air pressure at full motor operating
pressure,  <u>between </u>each pair of
O-rings at every joint,  instead of any motor
pressurization.   This is shown in the
figure.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>What this does is drive the downstream (backup) O-ring to
the correct side of the groove,  thus
seating it for motor operation. 
But,  <u>it also drives the
upstream (primary) O-ring to the wrong side of its groove</u>,  from which motor pressurization upon ignition
must unseat it,  drive it across its
groove,  and re-seat it on the correct
side!  Until and unless it re-seats on
that correct side,  the upstream
(primary) seal ALWAYS leaks! 
Period!  There is NO WAY AROUND
that outcome!  And <u>THAT</u> lets hot
gases and solids reach the primary O-ring, 
simply because the re-seating process takes a longer time than
pressurization!<o:p></o:p></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitSgMvC-kHc-pXjpAneBgWumvE-O7_Aco_meCBmalzOqJW_fuxhkaRNb9Yz6AFjVcYcJaapSjfjjcZrN61FzpucGV6M9VdPg421qtjkVUpyWnTRMenhPnFM0fUWIrp2AlQXxHI2b7Yk2ZX/s1153/F2+SRB+O+ring+joint+2.png"><img data-original-height="621" data-original-width="1153" height="215" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitSgMvC-kHc-pXjpAneBgWumvE-O7_Aco_meCBmalzOqJW_fuxhkaRNb9Yz6AFjVcYcJaapSjfjjcZrN61FzpucGV6M9VdPg421qtjkVUpyWnTRMenhPnFM0fUWIrp2AlQXxHI2b7Yk2ZX/w400-h215/F2+SRB+O+ring+joint+2.png" width="400"/></a></p><p><b>Figure 2 – The Improperly-Designed 2 O-ring Joint That
Flew,  Up Through Challenger<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p><b><i>NASA made a third mistake:</i></b>  <b><i>in the <u>mistaken belief</u> that it
would prevent hot gases and hot solids from reaching the O-ring,  they insisted on obstructing the
pressurization path by filling the insulation joint with “heat protective”
putty</i></b> (zinc chromate putty actually). 
This is also shown in the figure. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>This last mistake makes a bad risk even far worse,  because high pressure gases always
(ALWAYS!!!) “wormhole-through” a not-solid material (like putty or grease) at a
single point!  THIS effect is also shown
in the figure.  That re-distributes the
“push” of the gas from a broad front all around the O-ring,  <u>to a single point upon the O-ring</u>,  as indicated in the figure.  The delay unseating the ring,  pushing it to the other side of the
groove,  and reseating it,  almost guarantees that the compressed air
leaks past it,  so that booster hot gases
and solids can reach the O-ring.  <u>And
those will cut a hole right through it</u>.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>“Half-moon slices” right through the primary upstream O-ring
were seen,  upon SRB motor disassembly,  in a rather significant percentage of the
SRB’s recovered and refurbished.  That
verifies what I just said about the upstream O-ring being cut!  There is no surprise there,  once you understand the process!</p>

<p>The <u>difference</u> between this point load problem,  and what NASA analyzed in its structural
calculations for the O-ring seal <u>is quite stark</u>!  The structural analysts were assuming
pressurization on a broad front.  They
did <u>not</u> model the point load effect of the hot gases and solids
wormholing-through the putty obstructing the pressurization path.  <b><i>Quite simply,  what was built was NOT what was analyzed!</i></b><o:p></o:p></p>

<p><b>Unnecessary Risk to Fly Too Cold<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>If the motor is sufficiently cold-soaked,  the primary upstream O-ring loses its flexibility
and resilience (as do all of them). 
Pushing the entire embrittled O-ring across its groove all at once is
risky enough,  but if you concentrate the
“push” at one single location by the wormhole effect,  <u>you essentially guarantee snapping the
O-ring apart at that point</u>!  This
cold brittleness effect was amply demonstrated by Dr. Feynman at the Rogers
Commission hearings (assisted by Gen. Kutyna), 
when he stirred his sample of the O-ring material in his glass of ice
water,  and then demonstrated its non-resilience.
<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Any failure of the primary upstream O-ring,  whether by hot sandblast cutting,  or by cold brittle fracture from the point
jet force load,  then puts a single-point
hot sandblast jet impacting onto the downstream O-ring,  <u>simply because it is nearby</u>!  <b><i>Thus,  a sort of “cascade failure” is a very high
risk indeed!</i></b><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The post-Challenger “fix” was a third O-ring in every
joint.  This just set up the cascade
failure as a longer chain,  as indicated
in <b>Figure 3</b>.  The <u>only</u>
reason the Challenger disaster did not repeat is that they never flew that cold
again.  But the 1/51 failure rate
demonstrated by loss of Challenger speaks for itself!<o:p></o:p></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAgbkJu1b4mGz70Jrniya3VTRCegbo9Me1Mrm_an8gTBBZm9GopbjeaXB6TOcAwJoNtXNy1JlwmJW7ni4tTgcPqNFerTkq81qK4vt7iintrjc3qimNR-5ksnmKheNkb0jWEC6qtGRGffdi/s1153/F3+SRB+O+ring+joint+3.png"><img data-original-height="621" data-original-width="1153" height="215" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAgbkJu1b4mGz70Jrniya3VTRCegbo9Me1Mrm_an8gTBBZm9GopbjeaXB6TOcAwJoNtXNy1JlwmJW7ni4tTgcPqNFerTkq81qK4vt7iintrjc3qimNR-5ksnmKheNkb0jWEC6qtGRGffdi/w400-h215/F3+SRB+O+ring+joint+3.png" width="400"/></a></p><p><b>Figure 3 – The Cascade Failure Risk Was Compounded By the
Redesigned Joint<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p><b>Fatal Consequences We All Saw</b></p>

<p>The photography obtained during the launch and loss of
Challenger confirms everything claimed here. 
The seal failed upon motor ignition and pressurization,  as shown quite clearly in <b>Figure 4</b>.  The dark grey plume is carbon soot-bearing
hot gases spewing through the <u>two failed O-rings</u> at the aft segment joint. <o:p></o:p></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2f7gKyFLxHvdu8siPV81GcoGynssuzMAmjgh6baoNZjBos_PulJDwtoDm8I1DgwCMwUb_UR5GvbFTfcwSacMS8TIPujAkSaywqWqQnlGj85xIdzHOGIz2xzYJMpMCIjlQ2NQjjf-B0p9E/s330/F4+330px-STS-51-L_grey_smoke_on_SRB.jpg"><img data-original-height="247" data-original-width="330" height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2f7gKyFLxHvdu8siPV81GcoGynssuzMAmjgh6baoNZjBos_PulJDwtoDm8I1DgwCMwUb_UR5GvbFTfcwSacMS8TIPujAkSaywqWqQnlGj85xIdzHOGIz2xzYJMpMCIjlQ2NQjjf-B0p9E/w400-h300/F4+330px-STS-51-L_grey_smoke_on_SRB.jpg" width="400"/></a></p><p><b>Figure 4 – Seal Leak Upon Ignition Seen In Photography<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>This leak miraculously “cured” itself by plugging-up with
aluminum oxide-carbon slag from the metallized propellant.  This slag-plugging just happened to hold
pressure like that,  until the Challenger
encountered a wind shear while at “max-Q”,  where it was also most highly stressed by
aerodynamic forces.  The slag plug
failed,  letting the hot motor gases and
solids rush through the hole again.  This
is shown quite clearly as the anomalous bright-but-small extra plume in <b>Figure
5</b> below. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>This jet of leaking hot gases and solids finally got so big that
it cut through one of the aft struts holding the SRB to the center tank.  There is always hydrogen leaking from the
center tank’s hydrogen tank,  <u>and in
this case the leaked plume probably burned a hole in that hydrogen tank</u>.  With the strut cut,  the bottom of the SRB moved outboard.  That pushed the nose of the SRB inboard,  such that the nose of the SRB poked a hole in
the side of the center tank’s oxygen tank. 
<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Suddenly dumping oxygen into a base-burning hydrogen-air
fire caused an explosion in the wake behind the center tank that both
overheated and structurally overloaded it. 
The tank collapsed,  letting both
SRB’s and the orbiter fly free.   The
released propellants burned explosively as this happened.  All this happened in an instant,  so it looks like just the one sudden explosion.<o:p></o:p></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSTGQupKkSfEGOAjivR4UfYCZFsK0sy_zMChLxNPnAAghvyksgacH1ajKxMbnxKbERILiBeE-P6-ID7oVpmMKXgkKvzD0x1eP8jv743iQDZ3tmO6C5FULw3fRwxH2-_PZpvhCco07-i4wG/s330/F5+255px-Booster_Rocket_Breach_-_GPN-2000-001425.jpg"><img data-original-height="330" data-original-width="255" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSTGQupKkSfEGOAjivR4UfYCZFsK0sy_zMChLxNPnAAghvyksgacH1ajKxMbnxKbERILiBeE-P6-ID7oVpmMKXgkKvzD0x1eP8jv743iQDZ3tmO6C5FULw3fRwxH2-_PZpvhCco07-i4wG/w309-h400/F5+255px-Booster_Rocket_Breach_-_GPN-2000-001425.jpg" width="309"/></a></p><p><b>Figure 5 – Leakage Resumed After Being Shaken By Wind

<p>The released SRB’s continued to “fly” out-of-control under
their own thrusts,  as we all saw.  This is shown in <b>Figure 6</b>.  The orbiter’s engines were pointed through a
center of gravity that suddenly no longer existed,  so they forced the orbiter to pitch-up
violently,  before starving for lack of
propellant from the suddenly-missing center tank.  The pitched-up orbiter went broadside to the
supersonic wind,  which tore it to
pieces.  This is how those pieces,  that we all saw fall into the sea,  came to be.  <o:p></o:p></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKgK1-ROe1DyuLho5OBw950YXMds6GAjvtMD-XqaPjkF2ooheJO1Y0sxbDr56uqdHLDsxHpBTRO5siWfDRNhQ9uvCalOzuya0GI4r2xhH6KzXOLgqIm9Lbj6A3jMs0PKRPu6nv-mcjrFlE/s390/F6+Challenger_disaster_explosion.jpg"><img data-original-height="316" data-original-width="390" height="324" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKgK1-ROe1DyuLho5OBw950YXMds6GAjvtMD-XqaPjkF2ooheJO1Y0sxbDr56uqdHLDsxHpBTRO5siWfDRNhQ9uvCalOzuya0GI4r2xhH6KzXOLgqIm9Lbj6A3jMs0PKRPu6nv-mcjrFlE/w400-h324/F6+Challenger_disaster_explosion.jpg" width="400"/></a></p><p><b>Figure 6 – The SRB Did Not Explode,  But It Punched a Hole In the Center Tank<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p><b>Final Remarks<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>The two O-ring joint was a NASA-mandated design
mistake,  compounded by mandating putty
obstructing the O-ring pressurization paths. 
<b><i>The “customer is always right” in government contracting,  except that he was <u>lethally and fatally
wrong about this one</u>!  </i></b>See
also Ref. 3.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The decision to fly cold-soaked <u>colder than the SRB’s had
ever been tested</u>,  was also a NASA management
decision.  Both NASA and Thiokol
engineers objected,  but were
over-ruled.  Thiokol upper management
also over-ruled their own engineers,  and
told NASA to go ahead and launch.  Thus
emboldened by Thiokol management,  NASA
launched the thing,  thus killing its
crew. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The stand-down to “correct” this problem was nearly 2 years
long and horribly expensive.  Which just
goes to prove what I like to say to anyone who will listen:  <b><i>“there is nothing as expensive as a
dead crew,  especially one dead from a
bad management decision”.  <o:p></o:p></i></b></p>

<p>The only problem with that return-to-flight effort is that <u>they
did not correct the real problems</u> upon return-to-flight,  they actually made them worse with a 3-O-ring
joint,  and by keeping the putty
obstructions.  The ONLY thing they did “right”
was <u>never to fly that cold again</u>! 
<u>Which is very likely the ONLY reason that the Challenger disaster did
not repeat itself before the Shuttle got retired</u>,  since there were more than 51 more flights
after the Challenger disaster!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>By the way,  the <u>crew
did not die in the tank explosion</u> and subsequent ripping-apart of the
orbiter by air loads.  The telemetry
showed no high-gee accelerations at all! 
The crew was still alive in the orbiter cabin until it finally hit the
sea,  which is about a 200-gee stop,  since it hit dead broadside.  See <b>Figure 7</b>.<o:p></o:p></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhl16NqI2ouIQygLDduyoOffBl-8qLkt3Ye3E7JkaDfhufzBjUmA5BW1ZmHXs9oA__S5CWEX25F0jExya36cz1b1w2BLxt3bD3G_Cu6aLY2qMR1bPLEWEpRZBAxnxRJot7moP77w38Xsn2Y/s330/F7+330px-Challenger_breakup_cabin.jpg"><img data-original-height="242" data-original-width="330" height="294" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhl16NqI2ouIQygLDduyoOffBl-8qLkt3Ye3E7JkaDfhufzBjUmA5BW1ZmHXs9oA__S5CWEX25F0jExya36cz1b1w2BLxt3bD3G_Cu6aLY2qMR1bPLEWEpRZBAxnxRJot7moP77w38Xsn2Y/w400-h294/F7+330px-Challenger_breakup_cabin.jpg" width="400"/></a></p><p><b>Figure 7 – The Crew Was Still Alive In This Cabin Section
(Arrow) That Is Falling Back<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>I say what I said about the crew because the flight deck
back-seaters leaned forward and flipped on the breathing-air packs for the
front-seater pilots.  They would not have
done that unless they knew the cabin had depressurized,  and <u>that</u> would have been <u>significantly
AFTER the explosion</u> and ripping-apart of the orbiter.  They were tumbling clear of the explosion
cloud by that time,  as illustrated in
the figure.  <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Those two flight deck pilots had breathed-up all the oxygen
in their breathing packs by the time they hit the sea,  something confirmed by the empty breathing
packs that were recovered.  <u>Which
means they were alive when they hit the sea</u>!  By extension, 
so were the back-seaters,  plus
the three down on the mid-deck. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>They did not have pressure suits,  parachutes, 
breathing bottles,  and a hatch
they could blow open (basic bail-out gear). 
<b><i>More importantly,  there was
no way to take the spin off the tumbling cabin.</i></b>  Spinning like that,  there was no way to reach and exit the
hatch,  even if they had the other basic
bailout gear!  <b><i><u>But a small
drogue parachute from the nose of the cabin section would have taken off the
spin</u>!</i></b>  <b><i>That plus the basic
bail-out gear just listed could have saved that crew!  It took almost 5 minutes to hit the sea.  They had the time to bail out.<o:p></o:p></i></b></p>

<p>I submitted that means for bail-out to NASA,  <u>but I was ignored</u>.  Coming from an outsider,  my idea was “not invented here”,  as far as NASA was concerned.  Yet,  something
rather like it might even have worked for Columbia some years later:  the 3 mid-deck occupants were still alive inside
a tumbling cabin section as it approached impact near Tyler,  Texas,  well after the breakup during re-entry.   Time was short for a bail-out,  but without the de-spin drogue,  they could not reach the hatch at all.  <o:p></o:p></p>

<p><b>Final Notes<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>There are different design rules for static radial and
static face seals,  and different rules
yet for dynamic radial seals (as on a piston moving inside a cylinder,  like a syringe or a hydraulic cylinder).  The Shuttle SRB joints fall into the static
radial classification.  <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The appropriate set of rules specifies O-ring sizes and
hardness,  groove dimensions,  and when to use back-up rings.  You just follow the design rules,  and make sure that only compressed air
reaches the O-ring (and on a broad front), 
upon solid propellant motor ignition.  <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>You accomplish that broad-front pressurization with the
90-degree bend geometry to stop the hot solids and radiant heat transfer,  and by NEVER obstructing the O-ring pressurization
path with anything!  Even too close a fit
between the hard parts,  can cause
problems with the transient pressurizing flow. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>You verify your seal design, 
your case structural design,  <u>and
your leak check procedure</u>,  during
case hydroburst testing,  <u>long before
you ever cast a live motor</u>!  You
NEVER delete the hydroburst testing step in your development effort.  Never! 
Not for any reason at all!  <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Then you test live motors at every environmental extreme
condition in which you think you might possibly operate.  If any redesigns (of anything) are
needed,  you go back and verify them in all
the tests,  from hydroburst all the way
forward.  <u>No motor goes to production</u>,  until its <u>exact design configuration</u>
has been verified in every test at every test condition! <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Once your design has passed all those tests,  you stick with your verified leak check
procedure as if it were a religious mandate! 
You add rigorous quality control (of the “total quality management”
type),  for production.  That includes <u>X-raying every single item</u>,  to verify that there are no casting voids in
the propellant,  no unbonds between
propellant and case liner,  and no other propellant
grain cracks or other problems.  And then
you NEVER operate a motor outside the conditions for which it was tested!  <o:p></o:p></p>

<p><b><i>THAT is the way to achieve <u>no-more-than-1-in-a-million</u>
failure rates,  with solid propellant
rocket motors!<o:p></o:p></i></b></p>

<p>The “bean counters” and “management professionals” will
absolutely hate that prescription as “too expensive”,  but killing a crew with a bad design just costs
a whole lot more,  than the cost of
following that prescription.  We’ve
already seen that with Apollo-1, 
Challenger,  and Columbia.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Simple as that.  <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>And just as hard to sell to the “bean counters” and
“management professionals”,  as you might
fear.  <o:p></o:p></p>
