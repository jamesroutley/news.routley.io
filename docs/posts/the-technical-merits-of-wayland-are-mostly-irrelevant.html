    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The technical merits of Wayland are mostly irrelevant</h2>

	<p><small>August 31, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>Today I read <a href="https://orowith2os.gitlab.io/posts/wayland-breaks-your-bad-software/">Wayland breaks your bad software</a>
(<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ftl3yz/wayland_breaks_your_bad_software">via</a>),
which is in large part an inventory of how <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/wayland">Wayland</a> is technically
superior to X. I don&#39;t particularly disagree with Wayland&#39;s general
technical merits and improvements, but at this point I think that
they are mostly irrelevant. As such, I don&#39;t think that talking
about them will do much to shift more people to Wayland.</p>

<p>(Of course, people have other reasons to talk about Wayland&#39;s
technical merits. But a certain amount of this sort of writing
seems to be aimed at persuading people to switch.)</p>

<p>I say that the technical merits are irrelevant because I don&#39;t
believe that they&#39;re a major factor any more in most people moving
or not moving to Wayland. At this point in time (and from my vantage
point), there are roughly four groups of people still in the X camp:</p>

<ul><li>People on Unix environments that don&#39;t have Wayland support. They have
to use X or not have a graphical experience.<p>
(Suggesting that these people change to a Linux environment with
Wayland support is a non-starter; they are presumably using their
current environment for good reasons.)</p></li>
<li>People using mainstream desktop environments that already support
Wayland, primarily GNOME and KDE, in relatively stock ways.
Switching to Wayland is generally transparent for these people
and happens when their Linux distribution decides to change the
default for their hardware. If their Linux distribution has not
switched the default, there is often good reason for it.<p>
Most of these people will switch over time as their distribution
changes defaults, and they&#39;re unlikely to switch before then.</p></li>
<li>People using <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ModernDesktopEnvironments">desktop environments</a>
or custom X setups that don&#39;t (currently) support Wayland. Switching
to Wayland is extremely non-transparent for these people because
they will have to change their desktop environment (so far, to
GNOME or KDE) or reconstruct a Wayland version of it.
Back in 2021, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/WaylandMyView2021">this included XFCE and Cinnamon</a>,
and based on modest Internet searches I believe it still does.<p>
One can hope that some of these desktop environments will get
Wayland support over time, moving people using them up into the
previous category (and probably moving them to Wayland users).
However the primary bottleneck for this is probably time and
attention from developers (who by now probably have heard lots
about why people think they should add support for Wayland and
its technical merits).</p></li>
<li>People who could theoretically switch to Wayland and who might
gain benefits from doing so, but who have found good reasons
(often related to hardware support) that X works better for them
(cf some of the replies to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110986243938846607">my Fediverse post</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>(There are other smaller groups not included here, such as people
who have a critical reliance on X features not yet well supported
in Wayland.)</p>

<p>With only a slight amount of generalization, none of these people
will be moved by Wayland&#39;s technical merits. The energetic people
who could be persuaded by technical merits to go through switching
desktop environments or in some cases replacing hardware (or accepting
limited features) have mostly moved to Wayland already. The people
who remain on X are there either because they don&#39;t want to rebuild
their desktop environment, they don&#39;t want to do without features
and performance they currently have, or their Linux distribution
doesn&#39;t think their desktop should switch to Wayland yet.</p>

<p>There are still some people who would get enough benefit from what
Wayland improves over X that it would be worth their time and effort
to switch, even at the cost of rebuilding their desktop environment
(and possibly losing some features, because there are things that
X does better than Wayland today). But I don&#39;t think there are very
many of them left by now, and if they&#39;re out there, they&#39;re hard
to reach, since the Wayland people have been banging this drum for
quite a while now.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/WaylandMyView2021">My distant personal view of Wayland hasn&#39;t changed since 2021</a>, since Cinnamon still hasn&#39;t become Wayland
enabled as far as I know.)</p>

<p>PS: The other sense that Wayland&#39;s technical merits are mostly
irrelevant is that everyone agrees that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/WaylandNowTheFuture">Wayland is the future of
Unix graphics</a> and development of the X server
is dead. Unless and until people show up to revive X server
development, Wayland is the only game in town, and when you have a
monopoly, your technical merits don&#39;t really matter.</p>
