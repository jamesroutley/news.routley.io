                <div><p>They say that good things come to those who wait, and for this release there has been a lot of waiting but also plenty of good things. Trisquel 9.0, codename &#34;Etiona&#34; is our most polished release yet, thanks to the contribution of a very committed team of volunteers. This release comes in several flavors:</p><ul><li>MATE desktop, the default. Based on the popular fork of GNOME 2.x, this edition provides a classic desktop environment matching the user experience of previous Trisquel releases.</li><li>Trisquel Mini, a lightweight version for older machines and netbooks. Based on the LXDE desktop environment and a selection of resource-saving applications to bring new life to your hardware...</li></ul></div>

Following the naming suggestions <a href="https://trisquel.info/en/forum/trisquel-9-needs-name">thread</a> I&#39;ve picked <em>Etiona</em>, which sounds good and has the fewest search results.</p><p>We currently do our development in a rented dedicated server in France, and although it is functional it has many performance and setup issues. It has 32 gigs of RAM, which may sound like plenty but stays below the sweet spot where you can create big enough ramdisks to compile large packages without having to ever write to disk during the build process, greatly improving performance. It also has only 8 cores and rather...</p></div>

                <div><p>Trisquel 8.0, codename &#34;Flidas&#34; is finally here! This release will be supported with security updates until April 2021. The first thing to acknowledge is that this arrival has been severely delayed, to the point where the next upstream release (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS) will soon be published. The good news is that the development of Trisquel 9.0 will start <a href="https://trisquel.info/en/trisquel-90-development-plans">right away</a>, and it should come out closer to the usual release schedule of &#34;6 months after upstream release&#34;.</p><p>But this is not to say that we shouldn&#39;t be excited about Trisquel 8.0, quite the contrary! It comes with many improvements over Trisquel 7.0, and its core...</p></div>

These updates were long overdue but since we can now consistently dedicate more time to the project, we hope to make fast progress on all fronts.</p><p>The main topic for this meeting was the status of the Trisquel 8 release, which is close to ready but still pending some important tasks. The most visible ones are the outdated Trisquel metapackages (essential for the netinstall and distro-upgrading processes to work) and...</p></div>

                <p>2015 was a year of quiet but continuous progress for the Trisquel project. With no major release scheduled for the period, we focused on improving the build system and server infrastructure, making the distro more reliable through quicker and more traceable updates. Our long time sysadmin Santiago Rodriguez took on the big task of taking the original build scripts that produce all our packages and fitting them into a <a href="https://devel.trisquel.info/groups/trisquel">continuous integration system</a> and improved the build environment with pbuilder -for packages- and live-build -for images.</p>

The event will take place this weekend 21st-22nd of March at the Stata building at MIT in Cambridge, Massachussets. Ruben will give a talk entitled <em>Browse in privacy and freedom with GNU IceCat</em>.

                <p>As you may know, Trisquel is sovereign over its infrastructure. This means all of the services offered by Trisquel are managed by us, humans. We only rent the hardware and do everything else ourselves. Until now the git repositories were exported using gitweb and updated using shell accounts on the development box, but that has changed and we will be using gitlab for managing core repositories for the Trisquel project from now on.</p>
