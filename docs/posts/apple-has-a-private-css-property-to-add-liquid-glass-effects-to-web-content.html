    <h1>Apple has a private CSS property to add Liquid Glass effects to web content</h1>

        <p>I have an incredibly boring summer hobby: looking at the changelog for the <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit?ref=alastair.is" rel="noreferrer">WebKit Github repo</a>. Why? Because I spend a chunk of my professional life working with webviews inside mobile apps and I like to get an early peek into what&#39;s coming in the next version of iOS. Since Tim Cook has yet to stand up at WWDC and announce &#34;one more thing... Service Worker support in WKWebView, provided you add the correct entry to the <code>WKAppBoundDomains</code> array in your <code>Info.plist</code>&#34; (and you know what, he <em>should</em>) manual research is the order of the day.</p><p>So I was really interested to see, the day after WWDC finished, a pull request named:</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/46754/files?ref=alastair.is" rel="noreferrer">[Materials] Rename &#34;hosted blur&#34; materials to reference &#34;glass&#34;</a></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/?ref=alastair.is" rel="noreferrer">Liquid Glass</a> was one of the big takeaways from 2025&#39;s WWDC. Probably the biggest change in iOS UI since iOS 7 ditched the skeuomorphic look of the past. But that&#39;s all native UI, what does any of that have to do with webviews?</p><p>A poke around the context of the PR revealed something really interesting: Apple has a custom CSS property named <code>-apple-visual-effect</code> . Not only does it allow the use of Liquid Glass in iOS 26 (via values like <code>-apple-system-glass-material</code>) but all versions support using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials?ref=alastair.is#Standard-materials" rel="noreferrer">standard materials</a> with values like <code>-apple-system-blur-material-thin</code>.</p><h3 id="yes-it-works-and-no-we-cant">Yes it works and no, we can&#39;t</h3><p>Before you, like me, fire up Safari and start editing some CSS, I have bad news: no, it doesn&#39;t work on the web. As well it shouldn&#39;t. But it <em>also</em> doesn&#39;t work by default in an app using WKWebView, you have to toggle a setting in WKPreferences called <code>useSystemAppearance</code>... and it&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/613c42873c56e2b2073f91b2983eec825be6a791/Source/WebKit/UIProcess/API/Cocoa/WKPreferencesInternal.h?ref=alastair.is#L59" rel="noreferrer">private</a>. So if you use it, say goodbye to App Store approval.</p><p>I wanted to try it out all the same so I hacked around to set <code>useSystemAppearance</code> to true, set my CSS to:</p><pre><code>.toolbar {
  border-radius: 50%;
  -apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material;
  height: 75px;
  width: 450px;
}</code></pre><p>lo and behold, it works!</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://alastair.is/content/media/2025/09/glass_with_ipad_new_frame_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

                        </p>

        </figure><p>Whoever it was at Apple that decided to make this a CSS property is a genius because it makes it incredibly easy to provide different rules based on Liquid Glass support:</p><pre><code>.toolbar {
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 75px;
  width: 450px;
  background: rgba(204, 204, 204, 0.7);
}

@supports (-apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material) {
  background: transparent;
  -apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material
}</code></pre><h2 id="who-cares">Who cares?</h2><p>It&#39;s an interesting piece of trivia but no-one outside of Apple can use it. So what does it matter? It doesn&#39;t. Except for the implication for what I&#39;ll call <s>Alastair&#39;s Grand</s> <strong>The Toup√©e Theory of In-App Webviews</strong> (thanks to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45250878&amp;ref=alastair.is" rel="noreferrer">graypegg</a> on Hacker News for the rename). Industry wide they don&#39;t have a great reputation. But my suggestion is this: <strong>the main reason webviews in apps have such a bad reputation is because you don&#39;t notice the webviews that are integrated seamlessly.</strong></p><p>It stands to reason that Apple wouldn&#39;t have developed this feature if they weren&#39;t using it. Where? We have no idea. But they must be using it <em>somewhere</em>. The fact that none of us have noticed exactly where suggests that we&#39;re interacting with webviews in our daily use of iOS without ever even realising it.</p><p>Food for thought!</p>
