  <div>
    <div><p>November saw a nice run of scarcities including the second pintail and third and fourth woodcocks of the year. </p></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  
  <div>
          <div><p>There was also an early<strong> scaup, </strong>another <strong>short-eared owl, turnstone</strong> and an unusual run of <strong>dunlin. </strong>But<strong> </strong>the lack of a genuine rarity, which is often a feature of November, meant it was the first month since December 2021 without a new bird being added to the year list. It means the annual total is stuck on 143, still five ahead of last year but the gap is closing.  </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>After their post-breeding visit to the coast, the first <strong>shelduck</strong> normally arrives back in November but this year&#39;s first return on the 12th was the earliest in recent years. Two <strong>wigeon </strong>were seen on the 13th with another pair on the 17th. Having waited two years for a <strong>pintail </strong>to turn up again at the reservoirs, it was always on the cards that a second would arrive just weeks later with a drake this time on East Warwick on the 16th.  </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>The finding of a drake <strong>scaup</strong> on the 23rd by DW raised hopes that the regular winterer may have returned particularly as it appeared, as in the past, in the north-west corner of No 4 and, as usual, fell fast asleep. But hopes were dashed when no sign could be found next day. The first <strong>goldeneye</strong> - an immature drake - arrived on the 3rd but it wasn&#39;t until the 18th when more than one bird was seen with two drakes and a female. The three birds - the same number as last November - stayed until the end of the month. <strong>Goosander</strong> are becoming much more irregular at the Wetlands with no sighting until a drake on the 26th and 28th. The escaped <strong>ringed teal, </strong>however<strong>, </strong>clearly enjoyed their one day visit to the reservoirs last month as two males returned on the 14th, 15th and 18th.            </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>The wide shingle edges on Lockwood helped make it a much better November than normal for waders. It was particularly attractive to <strong>dunlin</strong> with perhaps as many as five birds this month. Singles were seen on the 16th, a different bird on 17th, on the 19th and two on the 21st. A tame <strong>turnstone</strong> was also on Lockwood on the 24th with <strong>redshank </strong>on the 5th &amp; 6th and another on the 27th.</p></div>
      </div>
    
  <div>
          <div><p><strong>Lapwing</strong> were less choosy with both Lockwood and East Warwick providing resting places with four on the 17th, a single on the 21st and seven next day. CF had the third &amp; fourth <strong>woodcock </strong>of the year - an unusually high number - with the first near the Dragonfly pond on the 17th with another off the side of Lockwood on the 22nd. <strong>Snipe</strong> in contrast, seemed either less common or more elusive than normal with only a handful of records. <strong>Common sandpipers</strong> continued to be seen with two until the end of the month.  </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>November was never likely to match October for scarcer gulls but both <strong>yellow-legged</strong> on the 24th and <strong>caspian </strong>on the 18th were seen. <strong>Common gulls</strong> built up with a count of 52 just on the south end of West Warwick, their favourite haunt, on the 26th. Checking colour-rings this month has revealed that among the <strong>black-headed gulls</strong> wintering are birds from both Slovakia and Poland.</p>
<p>Single <strong>red kites </strong>were seen on the 5th and 6th with a <strong>common buzzard</strong> over on the 6th as well. In an Autumn which has seen a major influx of <strong>short-eared owls</strong> into the country, the reservoirs had its third with one showing particularly well over Lockwood on the 12th. </p>
<p><strong>Skylarks </strong>were seen flying over on four days while male <strong>blackcaps</strong> were seen on the 9th and 20th. Winter thrush numbers were low but there were 15 <strong>fieldfare</strong> on the 11th with small numbers of this species and <strong>redwing</strong> feeding around the reservoirs&#39; berry bushes. Up to three<strong> stonechats</strong> continue to winter while another <strong>rock pipit</strong> turned up on Lockwood on the 12th. A small flock of up to eight <strong>siskins</strong> were seen regularly around the site this month with single<strong> lesser redpoll</strong> on the 6th and 24th. </p>
