Please.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Earlier on Friday, an economist hired by the parents testified that Jones, his media brand Infowars and parent company Free Speech Systems were worth up to $270m.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Reuters</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Jesse Lewis, six, was killed at Sandy Hook</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Bernard Pettingill told the court that records indicate Jones withdrew $62m for himself from his company in 2021 as his legal troubles grew.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;That number represents, in my opinion, a value of a net worth,&#34; Mr Pettingill said. &#34;He&#39;s got money put in a bank account somewhere.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Free Speech Systems filed for bankruptcy protections in the first week of the two-week trial. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The trial heard that Jones&#39; business had earned about $800,000 in a single day selling diet supplements, gun paraphernalia and survivalist equipment.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Lawyers for the parents accused Jones of trying to hide evidence, and argued that he had committed perjury when he denied having sent any messages about the Sandy Hook attack.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Earlier this week, an attorney for the plaintiffs revealed that Jones&#39; legal representative had accidentally sent them two years of the radio host&#39;s telephone texts. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Reuters</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The parents said Jones had made their lives &#34;hell&#34;</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He said that the congressional committee investigating last year&#39;s US Capitol riot had requested access to the messages as they look into Jones&#39; alleged role.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This is the first of three trials against Jones being brought by family members of Sandy Hook victims.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He has already lost a series of defamation cases filed by parents of the victims by default after failing to produce documents and testimony.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But this was the first trial in which financial damages were agreed by a jury.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Jones appeared briefly in the court on Friday, but was not present for the final verdict. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Despite retracting his claims about Sandy Hook, Jones has continued to use his media platform to argue the case was rigged against him and claimed that members of the jury pool &#34;don&#39;t know what planet they&#39;re on&#34;. His Infowars website depicted the judge being consumed by flames. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>His behaviour triggered several rebukes from the judge, who at one point told him: &#34;This is not your show.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Jones - a popular figure in US fringe conservative commentary - has repeatedly argued that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax orchestrated by the government to strip Americans of gun rights, and that the parents of the dead children were &#34;crisis actors&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>His lawyer had cited US constitutional free speech protections and asked for leniency in the trial, saying the jury had already sent a message to all radio hosts &#34;that their standard of care has changed&#34;.</p></div></article></div></div>
