<li>wassup? i&#39;ve been gone cos i accidentally accrued extra time on <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">beeminder</a>, the website/app i use to cajole myself into regularly writing weeknotes. today is the final day before I owe them $5 so write i must.</li>
<li>usually i have been sitting down to write these and been full of beans and pep and thoughts! the last time I did, I think shortly before my talk, i thought &#34;nope!!!!&#34; before i even opened the tab so it&#39;s for the best i had this little holiday i think.</li>
<li>can you believe we&#39;re in late november? as i say every time, time moves apace!</li>
<li>i&#39;m working on a video, i&#39;m in two minds about sharing early (before writing much) ideas in progress but it&#39;s about digital archiving if that&#39;s of any interest or your area of expertise! seriously though if it&#39;s your area of expertise email me i have so many questions to ask!</li>
<li>been more active on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/olu.online">bluesky</a> and enjoying the vibe other people are calling &#34;2010s tumblr&#34;. i am cringe and free.</li>
<li>trying out <a href="https://scrintal.com">scrintal</a> for video brainstorming. if you know anything the same but cheaper and not milanote (love it but also expensive) hmu?</li>
<li>started reading <a href="https://natureofcode.com/">the nature of code</a> now it&#39;s in javascript!!</li>
<li>barbecue beef hula hoops are so great. as are fiona cairns cupcakes. and shortbread biscuits of any brand. haven&#39;t been eating enough lebkuchen to have the holiday spirit running through my veins but will correct that in december.</li>
<li>started using trello again for my life plan trello board. &#34;life planning&#34; is less intense than it sounds in a lot of ways i just have many things i want to do and like to keep track of what gets done okay? also it&#39;s cool to see what is not important to me anymore with the rapidly filling &#34;not to do (now?)&#34; column. also taking suggestions for not-trello, not-obsidian, not-workflowy kanban boards but it works well enough lol.</li>
<li>every day i wish to like notion, every day i am driven further from its light.</li>
<li>keep vaccilating over writing a /uses page (for what i use most days, like software and pens and stuff!) and a page about technopaganism and what it means to me, but i will do both probably. when? shh. time will tell.</li>
