    <h1>sqlite-utils: a nice way to import data into SQLite for analysis</h1>
    
    

<p>Hello! This is a quick post about a nice tool I found recently called <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io">sqlite-utils</a>, from the <a href="https://jvns.ca/#cool-computer-tools---features---ideas">tools category</a>.</p>

<p>Recently I wanted to do some basic data analysis using data from my Shopify
store. So I figured I&rsquo;d query the Shopify API and import my data into SQLite,
and then I could make queries to get the graphs I want.</p>

<p>But this seemed like a lot of boring work, like I&rsquo;d have to write a
schema and write a Python program. So I hunted around for a solution, and I
found <code>sqlite-utils</code>, a tool designed to make it easy to import arbitrary data
into SQLite to do data analysis on the data.</p>

<h3 id="sqlite-utils-automatically-generates-a-schema">sqlite-utils automatically generates a schema</h3>

<p>The Shopify data has about a billion fields and I really did not want to type
out a schema for it. <code>sqlite-utils</code> solves this problem: if I have an array of
JSON orders, I can create a new SQLite table with that data in it like this:</p>

<pre><code>import sqlite_utils

orders = ... # (some code to get the `orders` array here)

db = sqlite_utils.Database('orders.db')
db['shopify_orders'].insert_all(orders)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="you-can-alter-the-schema-if-there-are-new-fields-with-alter">you can alter the schema if there are new fields (with <code>alter</code>)</h3>

<p>Next, I ran into a problem where on the 5th page of downloads, the JSON
contained a new field that I hadn&rsquo;t seen before.</p>

<p>Luckily, <code>sqlite-utils</code> thought of that: there&rsquo;s an <code>alter</code> flag which will
update the table&rsquo;s schema to include the new fields.  ```</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the code for that looks like</p>

<pre><code>db['shopify_orders'].insert_all(orders, alter=True)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="you-can-deduplicate-existing-rows-with-upsert">you can deduplicate existing rows (with <code>upsert</code>)</h3>

<p>Next I ran into a problem where sometimes when doing a sync, I&rsquo;d download data
from the API where some of it was new and some wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>So I wanted to do an &ldquo;upsert&rdquo; where it only created new rows if the item didn&rsquo;t
already exist. <code>sqlite-utils</code> also thought of this, and there&rsquo;s an <code>upsert</code>
method.</p>

<p>For this to work you have to specify the primary key. For me that was
<code>pk=&quot;id&quot;</code>. Here&rsquo;s what my final code looks like:</p>

<pre><code>db['shopify_orders'].upsert_all(
    orders,
    pk=&quot;id&quot;,
    alter=True
)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="there-s-also-a-command-line-tool">there&rsquo;s also a command line tool</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about using <code>sqlite-utils</code> as a library so far, but there&rsquo;s also a
command line tool which is really useful.</p>

<p>For example, this inserts the data from a <code>plants.csv</code> into a <code>plants</code> table:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite-utils insert plants.db plants plants.csv --csv
</code></pre>

<h3 id="format-conversions">format conversions</h3>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried this yet, but here&rsquo;s a cool example from the help docs of how
you can do format conversions, like converting a string to a float:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite-utils insert plants.db plants plants.csv --csv --convert '
return {
  &quot;name&quot;: row[&quot;name&quot;].upper(),
  &quot;latitude&quot;: float(row[&quot;latitude&quot;]),
  &quot;longitude&quot;: float(row[&quot;longitude&quot;]),
}'
</code></pre>

<p>This seems really useful for CSVs, where by default it&rsquo;ll often interpret numeric
data as strings if you don&rsquo;t do this conversions.</p>

<h3 id="metabase-seems-nice-too">metabase seems nice too</h3>

<p>Once I had all the data in SQLite, I needed a way to draw graphs with it. I
wanted some dashboards, so I ended up using <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a>, an open source business
intelligence tool. I found it very straightforward and it seems like a really
easy way to turn SQL queries into graphs.</p>

<p>This whole setup (sqlite-utils + metabase + SQL) feels a lot easier to use than
my previous setup, where I had a custom Flask website that used plotly and
pandas to draw graphs.</p>

<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all!</h3>

<p>I was really delighted by <code>sqlite-utils</code>, it was super easy to use and it did
everything I wanted.</p>
