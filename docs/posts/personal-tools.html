    <h1>Personal tools</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><img alt="Bob Ross painting" src="https://old.reddit.com/images/2025-04-03-personal-tools-bob-ross-painting.jpg"/></p><p>I used to make little applications just for myself. Sixteen years ago (oof) I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/tmcw/habiter">habit tracking application</a>, and a <a href="https://macwright.com/2012/02/15/minute">keylogger</a> that let me keep track of when I was using a computer, and generate some pretty charts.</p><p>Iâ€™ve taken a <em>long</em> break from those kinds of things. I love my hobbies, but theyâ€™ve drifted toward the non-technical, and the idea of keeping a server online for a <em>fun project</em> is unappealing (which is something that I hope <a href="https://www.val.town/">Val Town</a>, where I work, fixes). Some folks maintain whole â€˜homelabâ€™ setups and run Kubernetes in their basement. Not me, at least for now.</p><p>But I have been tiptoeing back into some little custom tools that only I use, with a focus on just my own computing experience. Hereâ€™s a quick tour.</p><h2 id="hammerspoon"><a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/">Hammerspoon</a></h2><p>Hammerspoon is an extremely powerful scripting tool for macOS that lets you write custom keyboard shortcuts, UIs, and more with the very friendly little language <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>. Right now my Hammerspoon configuration is very simple, but I think Iâ€™ll use it for a lot more as time progresses. Here it is:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>hs</span><span>.</span><span>hotkey</span><span>.</span><span>bind</span><span>({</span><span>&#34;cmd&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;shift&#34;</span><span>},</span> <span>&#34;return&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>()</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>frontmost</span> <span>=</span> <span>hs</span><span>.</span><span>application</span><span>.</span><span>frontmostApplication</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>frontmost</span><span>:</span><span>name</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>&#34;Ghostty&#34;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>frontmost</span><span>:</span><span>hide</span><span>()</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>hs</span><span>.</span><span>application</span><span>.</span><span>launchOrFocus</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;Ghostty&#34;</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Not much! But I recently switched to <a href="https://ghostty.org/">Ghostty</a> as my terminal, and I heavily relied on <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>â€™s global show/hide shortcut. Ghostty doesnâ€™t have an equivalent, and <a href="https://github.com/mhenrixon">Mikael Henriksson</a> suggested a <a href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/3141#discussioncomment-11716708">script like this</a> in GitHub discussions, so I ran with it. Hammerspoon can do <a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/index.html">practically anything</a>, so itâ€™ll probably be useful for other stuff too.</p><h2 id="swiftbar"><a href="https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar">SwiftBar</a></h2><p>I review a lot of PRs these days. I wanted an easy way to see how many were in my review queue and go to them quickly. So, this script runs with SwiftBar, which is a flexible way to put any scriptâ€™s output into your menu bar. It uses the <a href="https://cli.github.com/">GitHub CLI</a> to list the issues, and <a href="https://jqlang.org/">jq</a> to massage that output into a friendly list of issues, which I can click on to go directly to the issue on GitHub.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

Sidenote: <em>Greasemonkey was created by Aaron Boodman, who went on to write <a href="https://replicache.dev/">Replicache</a>, which I used in <a href="https://www.placemark.io/">Placemark</a>, and is now working on <a href="https://zero.rocicorp.dev/">Zero</a>, the successor to Replicache</em>.</p><p>Anyway, I have a few fancy credit cards which have â€˜offersâ€™ which only work if you â€˜activateâ€™ them. This is an annoying dark pattern! And thereâ€™s a solution to it - <a href="https://cardpointers.com/">CardPointers</a> - but I neither spend enough nor care enough about points hacking to justify the cost. Plus, Iâ€™d like to know what code is running on my bank website.</p><p>So, Tampermonkey to the rescue! I wrote userscripts for Chase, American Express, and Citi. You can check them out <a href="https://gist.github.com/tmcw/64498a6d230a6b6014088dd526a6f814">on this Gist</a> but I <em>strongly recommend</em> to read through all the code because of the afore-mentioned risks around running untrusted code on your bank accountâ€™s website!</p><h2 id="obsidian-freeform"><a href="https://github.com/tmcw/obsidian-freeform">Obsidian Freeform</a></h2><p>This is a plugin for <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, the notetaking tool <a href="https://macwright.com/2024/06/16/how-i-use-obsidian">that I use every day</a>. Freeform is pretty cool, if I can say so myself (I wrote it), but could be much better. The development experience is lackluster because you canâ€™t preview output at the same time as writing code: you have to toggle between the two states. Iâ€™ll fix that eventually, or perhaps Obsidian will add new API that makes it all work.</p><p>I use Freeform for a lot of private health &amp; financial data, almost always with an <a href="https://observablehq.com/plot/">Observable Plot</a> visualization as an eventual output.</p><p><img alt="Mortgage discounts" src="https://old.reddit.com/images/2025-04-03-personal-tools-mortgage-discounts.png"/></p><p>For example, when I was switching banks and one of the considerations was mortgage discounts in case I ever buy a house (ha ðŸ˜¢), it was fun to chart out the % discounts versus the required AUM. Itâ€™s been really nice to have this kind of visualization as â€˜just another documentâ€™ in my notetaking app. Doesnâ€™t need another server, and Obsidian is pretty secure and private.</p></div></article></div></div>
