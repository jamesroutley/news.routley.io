United had begun some preliminary inspection work in the past few days.</p><p>No one was seriously injured in the accident aboard the Alaska Airlines flight, though the blown-out panel produced a force so violent that some headrests and seatbacks were ripped from the cabin and the cockpit door was flung open, according to initial details of a federal safety investigation. No passengers were seated in the two seats next to the panel.</p><p>The National Transportation Safety Board said the accident would have been worse at cruising altitude when passengers and crews are walking around the cabin.</p><p>But the accident places <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/07/boeing-737-max-renewed-scrutiny.html">fresh scrutiny</a> on Boeing, which has spent years trying to clean up a host of quality defects, while also ramping up aircraft production, including of the 737 Max. CEO Dave Calhoun has spent months trying to assure airlines, investors and financial analysts that the company is improving its supply chain and working to resolve its quality problems.</p><p>Calhoun canceled a company leadership summit this week and plans to hold an all-employee call on Tuesday.</p><p>Alaska Airlines, which is set to inspect its fleet of more than 60 737 Max 9s, didn&#39;t immediately comment on whether it, too, has found loose bolts.</p><p>The FAA declined to comment on United&#39;s findings. Boeing didn&#39;t immediately respond to CNBC&#39;s request for comment.</p><p>The 737 Max is Boeing&#39;s best-selling aircraft, with more than 4,000 orders to fill. However, the more common Max 8, which is not affected by the grounding, makes up the majority of those orders.</p><p>Aviation publication The Air Current <a href="https://theaircurrent.com/feed/dispatches/united-finds-loose-bolts-on-plug-doors-during-737-max-9-inspections/" target="_blank">first reported</a> that United had discovered the loose bolts.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/03/wall-street-loves-this-stock-so-much-that-5-analysts-named-it-a-top-pick-in-one-day.html"><em>There&#39;s one stock Wall Street loves so much for 2024 that five analysts in one day picked it as their favorite</em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/06/morgan-stanley-names-its-top-stocks-for-2024-including-this-streaming-giant.html"><em>Morgan Stanley names its top stocks for 2024, including this streaming giant</em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/07/investing-tips-from-warren-buffett-to-start-the-new-year-on-the-right-foot.html"><em>Investing tips from Warren Buffett to start the new year on the right foot</em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/03/goldman-sees-50percent-gain-ahead-for-this-chinese-ev-stock-initiates-with-buy-rating.html"><em>Goldman sees a 50% gain ahead for this Chinese electric vehicle stock, initiates with buy rating</em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/05/ritholtzs-josh-brown-stock-picks-shares-twice-as-cheap-as-the-sp-500.html"><em>&#39;Twice as cheap&#39;: These stocks&#39; discount to the S&amp;P 500 is double its average, Ritholtz&#39;s Brown says</em></a></li></ul></div></div></div>
