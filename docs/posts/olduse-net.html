    <p>
      2025 has come and I&#39;ll keep olduse.net going - and as has become
      tradition - a new port with a years more delay has been added:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Port</th><th>Delay</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>11945</td><td>45 years</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      Keep having fun!
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2><a id="2024">2024 - on continue</a></h2>
    <p>
      Every year olduse.net adds another port with another years delay
      on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I remember to restart the nntpd and update the port
      forwarding setup in my router, that is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we are up to 2024 now, you have 5 different delays with
      which you can follow the beginning of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">usenet</a> interactively:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Port</th><th>Delay</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>11940</td><td>40 years</td></tr>
        <tr><td>11941</td><td>41 years</td></tr>
        <tr><td>11942</td><td>42 years</td></tr>
        <tr><td>11943</td><td>43 years</td></tr>
        <tr><td>11944</td><td>44 years</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      (Note: it doesn&#39;t make sense to connect eg Leafnode to
      multiple ports, you&#39;ll get the same articles, only with
      different delays.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Have fun!
    </p>

    <h2><a id="forty" href="#forty">Extended replay</a></h2>
    <p>
      olduse.net
      was <a href="https://mastodon.social/@crt0_S/109334531659415876">mentioned
      in a thread on the fediverse</a> recently. I couldn&#39;t help but
      reply with information about the current status. To my
      surprise <a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@taviso/109355600115208666">restarting
      the replay</a> was mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hadn&#39;t thought about that. But why not? I have all the
      articles in a <span title="PostgreSQL">database</span>, I could
      extract the Date: into a column, index it, and do some SQL to
      find every article more than 40 years old. From there the road
      isn&#39;t long to implementing a custom nntp daemon to serve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the implementation I realized that I could easily expose
      a 40 year delayed archive on one port, a 41 year delayed archive
      on another port, and so on, until the start of the archive
      (currently 42 years delayed).
    </p>
    <p>
      So here we are:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tbody><tr><th>Delay (years)</th><th>Connect to (port)</th><th>#groups</th><th>#articles</th></tr>
      <tr><td>40</td><td>olduse.net 11940</td><td>265</td><td>28640</td></tr>
      <tr><td>41</td><td>olduse.net 11941</td><td>91</td><td>3933</td></tr>
      <tr><td>42</td><td>olduse.net 11942</td><td>3</td><td>15</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <h2><a id="around" href="#around">Keeping olduse.net around</a></h2>
    <p>
      olduse.net was an interactive art installation conceived and
      implemented by <a href="https://joeyh.name/">Joey Hess</a> that ran
      from <a href="https://joeyh.name/blog/entry/announcing_olduse.net/">2011</a>
      to <a href="https://joeyh.name/blog/entry/the_end_of_the_olduse.net_exhibit/">2021</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      olduse.net was posting the first 10 years of
      archived <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">usenet</a>
      articles to
      a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_server">news
      server</a>, replaying usenet as it happened 30 years earlier. It
      also had a web interface with an interactive news reader,
      allowing you to access the news server via the web instead of
      using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol">nntp</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the project was announced I wanted a way to link to those
      old articles on the web, so I borrowed some of Joey Hess&#39; code
      and
      implemented <a href="https://article.olduse.net/">article.olduse.net</a>,
      by shoveling the archive into a database.
    </p>
    <p>
      My service hasn&#39;t seen that much use, but it did get its own
      version of <span title="A pun on &#39;slashdotting&#39;, which means a sudden spike in visits due to a specific popular site linking to it">&#34;FSF-dotting&#34;</span>, when the 30th anniversary of the GNU
      project announcement was celebrated, and many sites linked
      to <a title="... I am going to write a complete Unix-compatible software system called GNU (for Gnu&#39;s Not Unix) ..." href="https://article.olduse.net/771@mit-eddie.UUCP">the
      original article on article.olduse.net</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the art project was over I still wanted article.olduse.net
      to continue working, and Joey Hess was nice enough to transfer
      the domain to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here we are. <a href="https://article.olduse.net/">Enjoy</a>.
