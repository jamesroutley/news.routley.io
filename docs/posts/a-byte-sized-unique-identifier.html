				<p>C++23 will be the next C++ standard after C++20. This new standard significantly improves C++ but is less game-changing than C++98, C++11, or C++20. C++23 is more in the tradition of C++17.</p>

<p>To understand this next step in the evolution of C++, let me put the C++ standards into the historical context.</p>
<h3 id="h0-1-the-c-standards">The C++ Standards</h3>

<div><p>C++ is more than 40 years old. What happened in the last years? Here is a simplified answer ending in C++23.</p><h3 id="h0-2-c-98">C++98</h3>
<p>At the end of the 80ths, Bjarne Stroustrup and <span data-ved="0ahUKEwj1rL2Us6XlAhXDZlAKHV4_B1UQ2koIywEoAjAM">Margaret A. Ellis </span>wrote their famous book <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/arm.html">Annotated C++ Reference Manual </a>(ARM). These books served two purposes. First, there were many independent C++ implementations. ARM defined, therefore, the functionality of C++. Second, ARM was the base for the first C++ standard: C++98 (ISO/IEC 14882). C++98 had a few essential features: templates, the standard template library (STL) with its containers and algorithms, strings, and IO streams.</p>
<h3 id="h0-3-c-03">C++03</h3>
<p>With C++03 (14882:2003), C++98 got a technical correction that is so small that there is no place on my timeline. In the community, C++03, which includes C++98, is called legacy C++. </p>
<h3 id="h0-4-tr1">TR1</h3>
<p>In 2005 something exciting happened. The so-called technical report 1 (TR1; ) was published. TR1 was a big step toward C++11 and, therefore, toward Modern C++. TR1 (TR 19768) is based on the <a href="https://www.boost.org/">boost project</a> founded by members of the C++ standardization committee. TR1 has 13 libraries that should become part of the next C++ standard. For example, the library to the regular expression library, the random number library, smart pointers such as <code>std::shared_ptr</code>, and hashtables. Only the so-called special mathematic functions had to wait until C++17.</p>
</div>
<div><p>C++23 offers with deducing this a small but very impactful feature of the core language. Deducing this allows you, similar to Python, to make the implicitly passed this pointer in a member function definition explicit. Thanks to deducing this, a few complex techniques in C++, such as CRTP or the Overload Pattern, will become a piece of cake.</p></div>
<div><p>The C++23 library will get many impactful additions. You can directly import the standard library with<code> import std;,</code> or apply the C++20 format string in<code> std::print</code> and<code> std::println</code>. Additionally, we will get flat associative containers such as <code><span>std::flat_map</span></code> for performance reasons.<code> std::flap_map</code> is a drop-in replacement for <code>std::map</code>. <code>std::optional</code></p></div>			</div></div>
