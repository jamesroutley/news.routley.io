I&#39;m usually happy to eat meals and drink beverages together with others outdoors, and will not be eating meals together with others indoors. I plan to self-test with rapid antigen tests every morning at the convention.</p><p data-block-key="3bh8o"><a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2022/my-plans-for-wiscon-2022/">Last year I only participated virtually.</a> This year, I&#39;m going to WisCon to meet old friends and new, to emcee the Otherwise Auction to raise money for the <a href="https://otherwiseaward.org/">Otherwise Award</a> and entertain people, and to participate in a group that means something to me -- especially since <a href="http://wiscon.net/2023/03/01/wiscon-break-2024/">there will be no WisCon next year at all, in-person OR online.</a></p><p data-block-key="9uoe1">If you&#39;ve never attended WisCon before, <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2015/i-invite-first-timers-to-wiscon/">here&#39;s why I love it and why I invite you to come</a>.
