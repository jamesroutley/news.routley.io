    <h1>Show HN: I&#39;m an airline pilot â€“ I built interactive graphs/globes of my flights</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Since 2023, I have been a First Officer on the <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/products-services/commercial-aircraft/passenger-aircraft/a350-family">Airbus A350</a> with <a href="https://www.britishairways.com">British Airways</a> operating out of London Heathrow. Prior to this, I flew the <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/products-services/commercial-aircraft/passenger-aircraft/a320-family">Airbus A320</a> family based at Heathrow and Gatwick since 2016.</p><p><img alt="A photo of my father and I in the flight deck of an Airbus A350." src="https://jameshard.ing/_astro/james_neil_a350.CE3kQO6H_9zNaS.webp" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" height="525" loading="lazy" width="700"/> <small>A career highlight has been flying with my father, who is a Captain on the A350 with BA.</small></p><p>I joined British Airways through their cadet scheme in 2014, which included an Integrated ATPL course that I completed at <a href="https://www.ftejerez.com/">FTEJerez</a> in Andalucia, Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸. My flying journey began in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, where I obtained my Glider Pilot License, Instructor Rating, and my PPL through <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/cadets-junior-canadian-rangers/cadets/what-we-do/air.html">Canadian Air Cadet</a> scholarships.</p><h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2><p>I log all of my flights digitally using <a href="https://coradine.com/">LogTen Pro</a>, which lets me <a href="https://jameshard.ing/posts/querying-logten-pilot-logbook-sql">query them using SQL</a> and present them in infographic format. My favourite is the GitHub-style flying history.</p><div><video autoplay="" controls="" id="background" loop="" muted="" poster="/assets/pilot/globes/globe-thumbnail.jpg"><source src="/assets/pilot/globes/globe.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><source src="/assets/pilot/globes/globe.webm" type="video/webm"/><source src="/assets/pilot/globes/globe.ogv" type="video/ogg"/></video><p><small>I have built some <a href="https://jameshard.ing/pilot/globes">globe visualisations</a> to show my logbook in 3D.</small></p></div></div></div><div><div><section><astro-island client="only" component-export="default" component-url="/_astro/FlightTime.C7Hk-Qei.js" opts="{&#34;name&#34;:&#34;FlightTime&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;react&#34;}" props="{}" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BqmUPOuI.js" ssr="" uid="ZXEI2j"></astro-island></section><section><div><h2>Destination Matrix</h2><p>The outer ring shows the number of flight <i>to</i> each country, and each band shows the number of flights to a country <i>from a specific other country</i>. You&#39;ll notice that some destinations do not have an equal number of departures or arrivals - this is due to positioning/deadhead sectors.</p><p>The single sector from Portugal to Spain was due to a diversion from Madeira to Tenerife in poor weather.</p></div><astro-island client="only" component-export="default" component-url="/_astro/FlightMatrix.CooHsZjb.js" opts="{&#34;name&#34;:&#34;FlightMatrix&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;react&#34;}" props="{}" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BqmUPOuI.js" ssr="" uid="Z17RGKz"></astro-island></section><section><div><h2>Flight Calendar</h2><p>Programmers who use GitHub have access to a beautiful &#34;activity graph&#34; to visualise their daily code contributions.</p><p>Here is the pilot version: Colours correspond with the number of hours flown each day.

In aviation, we log time from &#34;brakes off&#34; to &#34;brakes on&#34;. Some acronym definitions:</p><ul><li><b>PIC</b>: Pilot in Command</li><li><b>PICUS</b>: Pilot in Command, Under Supervision</li><li><b>P1</b>: Pilot 1 - Pilot Flying for Take Off and Landing</li><li><b>P2</b>: Pilot 2 - Pilot Monitoring for Take Off and Landing</li><li><b>Heavy</b>: &#34;Extra&#34; pilot on long trips. On jump seat for take off and landing.</li></ul><p>At British Airways, the P1 and P2 sectors are usually shared between Captains and FOs, and whoever is P1 &#34;runs&#34; the sector. The Captain is always in command throughout the sector, but FOs are empowered to make decisions and run sectors as <i>PIC under supervision</i>.</p><p>BA SOPs also dictate that every approach is flown as a <a href="https://skybrary.aero/articles/monitored-approach">monitored approach</a>. At top of descent, the P2 will become Pilot Flying, and will fly the approach to 1000ft AGL, where P1 will retake control to land.</p></div><astro-island client="only" component-export="default" component-url="/_astro/FlightAnnualTotal.Ci5UILzF.js" opts="{&#34;name&#34;:&#34;FlightAnnualTotal&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;react&#34;}" props="{}" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BqmUPOuI.js" ssr="" uid="1mHngx"></astro-island></section><section><div><h2>Cumulative Hours</h2><p>The time per-aircraft is separated by <a href="https://www.icao.int/publications/DOC8643/Pages/Search.aspx">ICAO Type Designator</a> codes. The A320 family includes &#34;CEO&#34; (A320) and &#34;NEO&#34; (A32N) variants, in addition to A319 and A321 variants.</p></div><astro-island client="only" component-export="default" component-url="/_astro/FlightAircraftGraph.Duz3YhgY.js" opts="{&#34;name&#34;:&#34;FlightAircraftGraph&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;react&#34;}" props="{}" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BqmUPOuI.js" ssr="" uid="Zx73Mq"></astro-island></section><section><div><h2>Flight Time vs Distance</h2><p>One would expect flight time to increase linearly with distance, which is approximately true. However, due to prevailing winds, often the outbound and inbound flights from London have different times.</p><p>The distance measurement in this graph is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance">great circle distance</a> between airports. You can graphically see that westbound flights from London take longer outbound due to headwinds.</p></div><astro-island client="only" component-export="default" component-url="/_astro/FlightTimeDistance.BhDyYUra.js" opts="{&#34;name&#34;:&#34;FlightTimeDistance&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;react&#34;}" props="{}" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BqmUPOuI.js" ssr="" uid="1KO2jh"></astro-island></section></div></div></div>
