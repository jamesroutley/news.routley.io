    <p data-block-key="685z4">In the pursuit of scientific advances, researchers combine ingenuity and creativity with insight and expertise grounded in literature to generate novel and viable research directions and to guide the exploration that follows. In many fields, this presents a breadth and depth conundrum, since it is challenging to navigate the rapid growth in the rate of scientific publications while integrating insights from unfamiliar domains. Yet overcoming such challenges is critical, as evidenced by the many modern breakthroughs that have emerged from transdisciplinary endeavors. For example, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna won the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2020/10/popular-chemistryprize2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> for their work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRISPR</a>, which combined expertise ranging from microbiology to genetics to molecular biology.</p><p data-block-key="bngi7">Motivated by unmet needs in the modern scientific discovery process and building on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent AI advances</a>, including the ability to synthesize across complex subjects and to perform <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-term planning and reasoning</a>, we developed an <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/coscientist_paper/ai_coscientist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI co-scientist system</a>. The AI co-scientist is a multi-agent AI system that is intended to function as a collaborative tool for scientists. Built on <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini 2.0, AI co-scientist is</a> designed to mirror the reasoning process underpinning the scientific method. Beyond standard literature review, summarization and “deep research” tools, the AI co-scientist system is intended to uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and tailored to specific research objectives.</p>

    </p>



    <p data-block-key="685z4">Given a scientist’s research goal that has been specified in natural language, the AI co-scientist is designed to generate novel research hypotheses, a detailed research overview, and experimental protocols. To do so, it uses a coalition of specialized agents — <i>Generation</i>, <i>Reflection</i>, <i>Ranking</i>, <i>Evolution</i>, <i>Proximity</i> and <i>Meta-review</i> — that are inspired by the scientific method itself. These agents use automated feedback to iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine hypotheses, resulting in a self-improving cycle of increasingly high-quality and novel outputs.</p>

  <p data-block-key="j3yy8">Purpose-built for collaboration, scientists can interact with the system in many ways, including by directly providing their own seed ideas for exploration or by providing feedback on generated outputs in natural language. The AI co-scientist also uses tools, like web-search and specialized AI models, to enhance the grounding and quality of generated hypotheses.</p>

    <p data-block-key="685z4">The AI co-scientist leverages <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test-time compute</a> scaling to iteratively reason, evolve, and improve outputs. Key reasoning steps include <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphago-zero-starting-from-scratch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-play</a>–based scientific debate for novel hypothesis generation, ranking tournaments for hypothesis comparison, and an &#34;evolution&#34; process for quality improvement. The system&#39;s agentic nature facilitates recursive self-critique, including tool use for feedback to refine hypotheses and proposals.</p><p data-block-key="7ufde">The system&#39;s self-improvement relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elo</a> auto-evaluation metric derived from its tournaments. Due to their core role, we assessed whether higher Elo ratings correlate with higher output quality. We analyzed the concordance between Elo auto-ratings and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPQA benchmark</a> accuracy on its diamond set of challenging questions, and we found that higher Elo ratings positively correlate with a higher probability of correct answers.</p>

  <p data-block-key="685z4">Seven domain experts curated 15 open research goals and best guess solutions in their field of expertise. Using the automated Elo metric we observed that the AI co-scientist outperformed other state-of-the-art agentic and reasoning models for these complex problems. The analysis reproduced the benefits of scaling test-time compute using inductive biases derived from the scientific method. As the system spends more time reasoning and improving, the self-rated quality of results improve and surpass models and unassisted human experts.</p>

  <p data-block-key="685z4">On a smaller subset of 11 research goals, experts assessed the novelty and impact of the AI co-scientist–generated results compared to other relevant baselines; they also provided overall preference. While the sample size was small, experts assessed the AI co-scientist to have higher potential for novelty and impact, and preferred its outputs compared to other models. Further, these human expert preferences also appeared to be concordant with the previously introduced Elo auto-evaluation metric.</p>

    <p data-block-key="685z4">Drug development is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroom%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasingly time-consuming and expensive process</a> in which new therapeutics require many aspects of the discovery and development process to be restarted for each indication or disease. Drug repurposing addresses this challenge by discovering new therapeutic applications for existing drugs beyond their original intended use. But, due to the complexity of the task, it demands extensive interdisciplinary expertise.</p><p data-block-key="d494o">We applied the AI co-scientist to assist with the prediction of drug repurposing opportunities and, with our partners, validated predictions through computational biology, expert clinician feedback, and <i>in vitro</i> experiments.</p><p data-block-key="18gc5">Notably, the AI co-scientist proposed novel repurposing candidates for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acute myeloid leukemia</a> (AML). Subsequent experiments validated these proposals, confirming that the suggested drugs inhibit tumor viability at clinically relevant concentrations in multiple AML cell lines.</p>

    <p data-block-key="685z4">Identifying novel treatment targets is more complex than drug repurposing, and often leads to inefficient hypothesis selection and poor prioritization for <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments. AI-assisted target discovery helps to streamline the process of experimental validation, potentially helping to reduce development time costs.</p><p data-block-key="8k4au">We probed the AI co-scientist system&#39;s ability to propose, rank, and generate hypotheses and experimental protocols for target discovery hypotheses, focusing on <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC546435/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liver fibrosis</a>. The AI co-scientist demonstrated its potential by identifying epigenetic targets grounded in preclinical evidence with significant anti-fibrotic activity in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28878125/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human hepatic organoids</a> (3D, multicellular tissue cultures derived from human cells and designed to mimic the structure and function of the human liver).

    <p data-block-key="685z4">As a third validation, we focused on generating hypotheses to explain bacterial gene transfer evolution mechanisms related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) — microbes&#39; evolved mechanisms to resist infection-treating drugs. This is another complex challenge that involves understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene transfer (<a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/conjugation-prokaryotes-290/#:~:text=Conjugation%20is%20the%20process%20by,factor%2C%20or%20F%2Dfactor." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conjugation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transduction</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_transformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transformation</a>) alongside the ecological and evolutionary pressures that drive AMR genes to spread.</p><p data-block-key="9a67g">For this test, expert researchers instructed the AI co-scientist to explore a topic that had already been subject to novel discovery in their group, but had not yet been revealed in the public domain, namely, to explain how <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36596306/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">capsid-forming phage-inducible chromosomal islands</a> (cf-PICIs) exist across multiple bacterial species. The AI co-scientist system independently proposed that cf-PICIs interact with diverse phage tails to expand their host range. This<i> in silico</i> discovery, which had been experimentally validated in the original novel laboratory experiments performed prior to use of the AI co-scientist system, are described in co-timed manuscripts (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.11.637232v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/coscientist_paper/penades2025ai.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>) with our collaborators at the Fleming Initiative and Imperial College London.

    <p data-block-key="685z4">In our report we address several limitations of the system and opportunities for improvement, including enhanced literature reviews, factuality checking, cross-checks with external tools, auto-evaluation techniques, and larger-scale evaluation involving more subject matter experts with varied research goals. The AI co-scientist represents a promising advance toward AI-assisted technologies for scientists to help accelerate discovery. Its ability to generate novel, testable hypotheses across diverse scientific and biomedical domains — some already validated experimentally — and its capacity for recursive self-improvement with increased compute, demonstrate its potential to accelerate scientists&#39; efforts to address grand challenges in science and medicine. We look forward to responsible exploration of the potential of the AI co-scientist as an assistive tool for scientists. This project illustrates how collaborative and human-centred AI systems might be able to augment human ingenuity and accelerate scientific discovery.</p>
