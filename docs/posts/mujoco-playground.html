        We introduce MuJoCo Playground, a fully open-source framework for robot
        learning built with MJX, with the express goal of streamlining simulation,
        training, and sim-to-real transfer onto robots.
        With a simple installation process (<span>pip install playground</span>), researchers can train policies in minutes on a single GPU.
        Playground supports diverse robotic platforms, including quadrupeds,
        humanoids, dexterous hands, and robotic arms, and enables zero-shot
        sim-to-real transfer from both state and pixel inputs. This is achieved
        through an integrated stack comprising a physics engine, batch renderer,
        and training environments. MuJoCo Playground was a community effort involving multiple groups, and we hope it proves valuable to researchers and developers alike.
