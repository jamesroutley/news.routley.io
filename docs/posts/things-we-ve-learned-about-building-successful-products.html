Having a high bar for hiring is critical because </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/149601419/taking-shortcuts-when-hiring" rel="">talent compounds</a><span>.

A lack of trust is often one of the biggest bottlenecks a team has.

It’s </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/how-not-to-be-boring?utm_source=publication-search" rel="">your brand</a><span> and how your product is experienced by others. How much you invest in each function, the people you hire, what you decide to build, what function leads your company, your customer communication, and your pricing all matter in making you unique.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Your website is the first impression your product is making. A </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/148803758/what-would-stop-me-from-using-this-thing" rel="">boring</a><span>, templated one signals the product and team behind the website isn’t very strong. Creating a website unique to you and built for your ideal customer profile is a way to prevent this, and encourage users into your product.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Sometimes it’s </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/142577602/is-your-product-the-problem-or-the-market" rel="">the market’s problem</a><span>, not your product. For example, when Monzo founder and YC partner </span><a href="https://twitter.com/t_blom" rel="">Tom Blomfield</a><span> was building a bill-splitting service for college friends, he got the advice to stop building and start trying to acquire new users. When he got one new user after four weeks of cold calling, he knew it was time to pivot.</span></p></li><li><p><span>If you’re going to pivot, </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/142577602/if-youre-going-to-pivot-make-it-big" rel="">make it big</a><span>. Stewart Butterfield pivoted two video game companies into Flickr and Slack. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman says startup founders can pivot from failure to success, but only if they “slash and burn” the rest of their business. If it looks similar, go further.</span></p></li><li><p><span>As 37Signal’s </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1337095209620946944" rel="">Jason Fried</a><span> says “You cannot validate an idea. It doesn’t exist, you have to build the thing. The market will validate it.”</span></p></li><li><p>Plans are useful, but sticking rigidly to them is not. Good execution should not mean executing a specific plan, but repeatedly doing the most important things. Judge people on what they ship, how often they ship, and the impact of their work, not on whether they “stuck to the plan.”</p></li><li><p>Waiting “one more week” to ship something is nearly always a bad idea. This attitude extrapolated out over months = way less momentum. The sooner you get something into the hands of users, the sooner you’ll learn if it’s something they’ll value, and how to make it better.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg" width="695" height="364.875" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:630,&#34;width&#34;:1200,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:695,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;topImage&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a></figure></div></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/138653073/reduce-work-in-progress" rel="">Reduce your work in progress</a><span>.

This makes deciding what to build much clearer and faster.

They don&#39;t just &#34;know&#34; what to build from the start or have a grand vision. Instead, they ship things, get them into the hands of users, iterate on feedback, and repeat.

Doing this will ensure that the interview clarifies your focus in next steps, rather than distracting and confusing you.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Out of all the things you could potentially build, support requests are one of the most “real.” A specific user has a specific problem. When you solve it, you just </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/147529900/constant-improvements" rel="">improved your product</a><span>, other changes can’t say the same.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Doing support as an engineer </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/147529900/encouraging-full-cycle-ownership" rel="">encourages ownership</a><span> of the full lifecycle of a product from ideation to implementation to ongoing maintenance.

This means they need to be comfortable building MVPs and proofs of concept, shipping unpolished work, getting feedback, and pivoting when things aren’t working. It also means having all the skills to go from zero to built, everything from infrastructure to design.</span></p></li><li><p>Running a successful A/B test requires a good hypothesis explaining what you’re testing and why you’re testing it. Include the context of the test, the change, the metric, and the expected results.</p></li><li><p>When running product experiments, know that they might fail and get removed. This means you should set it up to be removed (with a feature flag) and ship the “good enough” version over the perfectly maintainable and scalable one. You can improve it later, once it succeeds.</p></li><li><p><span>Product experiments can </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/148982770/how-to-start-developing-an-experimentation-mindset" rel="">be a lot “dumber” than you realize</a><span>. For example, instead of building out a full feature, try a fake door test. This is where you add options or buttons with nothing behind them to check that people will click on them.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Failure is not the end of the world for product experiments. At </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments" rel="">Google</a><span>, 80-90% of experiments &#34;fail.&#34; You might think of this as a waste of time, but, at scale, 10% of successes can more than pay for all the failures. For example, an A/B test of how Bing displayed headlines boosted revenue by 12% (more than $100M at the time).</span></p></li><li><p><span>When focusing on growth, </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/148982770/prioritize-like-a-growth-engineer" rel="">think (and prioritize) like a growth engineer</a><span>. Identify a target area, figure out a metric representing that area, create a hypothesis on how to improve it, and implement as small an experiment as possible to test it.</span></p></li><li><p><span>It’s just about never </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/142334709/its-too-early-for-analytics" rel="">too early for analytics</a><span>. This makes sense for </span><em>pre-launch</em><span> products, but </span><em>launching</em><span> without analytics because “it’s too early” is a false economy. Once you launch, priorities shift from shipping as fast as possible to shipping the right thing as fast as possible.</span></p></li><li><p>When starting with analytics, start small. Choose a specific product or feature, track its usage with autocapture, visualize this data with trends and retention graphs, and try to ship features that improve those.
