        <p>Avo has enabled our team and client to <span>collaborate in a much more seamless way</span>.</p> <p>Our favorite thing about Avo is the feature-loaded <span>modern web interface and the ease of customizing from fields to pages is also impressive</span>.</p>

        <p>Avo has been a dream to work with and we quickly took the leap to utilizing Avo Pro.</p> <p>From <span>easily implementing search, to great docs, to providing charts out of the box</span>, to the beautiful API ‚Äî Avo is everything I&#39;ve been looking for in an administration toolkit.</p>

        <p>Avo is a beautiful Rails based administration system. In comparison to competitors, it wins in it&#39;s visual style immediately and that&#39;s not taking into account all of its features.</p> <p><span>It&#39;s simple to use, has excellent documentation, and anything that is not covered is helped super quickly and efficiently</span> by Adrian.</p> <p>Highly recommended!</p>

        <p>Avo, for me as a freelance webdev, was a gift. You can build beautiful admin panels in <span>the true Rails spirit, fast and effective</span>.</p> <p>Not does it only look great, but it has all the latest bells and whistles from Rails, like <span>Hotwire</span>.</p>

        <p>I was hand-rolling an admin dashboard for this community database of third-party RPG content. It was painful for them to use but this morning <span>I just dropped Avo in and suddenly it&#39;s a dream</span>!</p><p>Means <span>I can focus on the user-facing stuff without worrying about neglecting the data entry people</span> ü§£</p>

  <p>Using Avo is like having a whole new team taking care of all your admin needs</p>
  <p>
    Why waste time and budget building the same things over and over again? You need that budget to work on the core business side of our apps. Using Avo, you&#39;ll get all that at a fraction of what it would cost to pay a developer to build it. </p>
