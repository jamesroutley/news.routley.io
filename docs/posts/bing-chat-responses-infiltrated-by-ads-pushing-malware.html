    <h1>Bing Chat responses infiltrated by ads pushing malware</h1>

<p>Malicious advertisements are now being injected into Microsoft&#39;s AI-powered Bing Chat responses, promoting fake download sites that distribute malware.</p>
<p>Bing Chat, powered by OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4 engine, was introduced by Microsoft in February 2023 to challenge Google&#39;s dominance in the search industry.</p>
<p>By offering users an interactive chat-based experience instead of the traditional search query and result format, Bing Chat aimed to make online searches more intuitive and user-friendly.</p>
<p>In March, Microsoft began injecting ads into Bing Chat conversations to generate revenue from this new platform.</p>
<p>However, incorporating ads into Bing Chat has opened the door to threat actors, who <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-access-brokers-use-google-ads-to-breach-your-network/" target="_blank">increasingly take</a> out <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-abuse-google-ads-to-spread-malware-in-legit-software/" target="_blank">search advertisements to distribute malware</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, conversing with AI-powered chat tools can instill unwarranted trust, potentially convincing users to click on ads, which isn&#39;t the case when skimming through impersonal search results.</p>
<p>This conversation-like interaction can imbue AI-provided URLs with a misplaced sense of authority and trustworthiness, so the existing problem of malvertizing in search platforms is amplified by the introduction of AI assistants.</p>
<p>The fact that these ads are labeled as promoted results when the user hovers over a link in Bing Chat conversations is likely too weak of a measure to mitigate the risk.</p>
<h2>Imitating a popular IP scanner</h2>
<p>Malicious ads <a href="http://malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/09/malicious-ad-served-inside-bing-ai-chatbot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">spotted by Malwarebytes</a> are pretending to be download sites for the popular &#39;Advanced IP Scanner&#39; utility, which has been previously used by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cuba-ransomware-affiliate-targets-ukrainian-govt-agencies/" target="_blank">RomCom RAT</a> and <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-says-russian-hacktivists-use-new-somnia-ransomware/" target="_blank">Somnia ransomware</a> operators.</p>
<p>The researchers found that when you asked Bing Chat how to download Advanced IP Scanner, it would display a link to download it in the chat. </p>
<p>However, when you hover over an underlined link in a chat, Bing Chat may show an advertisement first, followed by the legitimate download link. In this case, the sponsored link was a malvertisements pushing malware.</p>

<p>The malvertizing campaign was created by someone who hacked into the ad account of a legitimate Australian business to create two malicious ads targeting system admins (IP scanner) and lawyers (MyCase law manager).</p>

<p>Clicking on the malicious ad for the IP scanner takes users to a website (&#39;mynetfoldersip[.]cfd&#39;) that separates bots and crawlers from human victims by checking IP address, timezone, and various system indicators for sandbox/virtual machines.</p>
<p>The victims are then redirected to &#39;advenced-ip-scanner[.]com&#39;, a clone of Advanced IP Scanner that uses typosquatting (notice the <strong>e</strong> in adv<strong>e</strong>nced) to trick visitors.</p>

<p>The downloaded MSI installer contains three files, one of which is a heavily obfuscated malicious script that connects to an external resource to retrieve the payload.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Malwarebytes could not find the final payload for this malware campaign, so it is unclear what malware is ultimately being installed.</p>
<p>However, in similar campaigns, threat actors commonly distribute information-stealing malware or remote access trojans that allow them to breach other accounts or corporate networks.</p>
<p>The display of malvertising within Bing Chat conversations highlights the expanding frontier of cyber threats and makes it crucial for users to be wary of chatbot results and always double-check URLs before downloading anything.</p>
