    <h1>Witch – macOS window switcher replacement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div>

<!-- BODY STARTS HERE -->

<h2>Switch Everything</h2>

<p>The built-in macOS app switcher is great if all you use are one-window applications. But you probably have many windows open in many apps, possibly with many tabs, and navigating them all is a pain. Enter Witch, with which you can switch everything…</p>



<h2>Multiple Switchers</h2>

<p>Can&#39;t decide whether you&#39;d like to switch apps, windows, or tabs? With Witch, you don&#39;t have to decide; you can have as many switchers as you like.</p>

<p><a href="https://manytricks.com/witch/images/4/multiswitch_big.png" title="Witch lets you have as many switchers as you want" data-zoomimagepixelratio="2"><img src="https://manytricks.com/witch/images/4/multiswitch_small.png"/></a></p>

<!--<p>Set up ⌘-Tab to switch only applications; ⌥-Tab to switch apps, windows, and tabs; and perhaps define a hot key to deminimize the minimized windows of the frontmost app.</p>-->

<p>Every switcher&#39;s actions—including sort order, orientation, and tab handling—can be customized to suit your needs.</p>

<h2>Flexible Switchers</h2>

<p>Unlike the built-in macOS app switcher, Witch isn&#39;t locked to one layout. As demonstrated in the splash movie, it can be set up horizontally, to mimic the built-in app switcher. Or it can also be used vertically, as seen in the above screenshots. But Witch has one more layout option: Menu bar mode.</p>

<p><img src="https://manytricks.com/witch/images/4/menubar.jpg"/></p>

<p>Any Witch switcher can also (or only) be shown in your menu bar by checking the &#34;Show in menu bar&#34; box on any defined Witch action.</p>

<h2>Seek and Ye Shall Find</h2>

<p>In addition to traditional &#34;see target, select target, activate target&#34; switching, Witch supports search-based switching. Activate the search field and start typing—Witch will thin the list of matching targets in real time, making it simple to select just the app or window or tab that you want to activate.</p>

<h2><!--Of course Witch has many other tricks…-->More Nice Things</h2>

<div>
	<p><a href="https://manytricks.com/witch/images/4/minor1_big.png" title="Spring-loaded windows and tabs pop up automatically" data-zoomimagepixelratio="2"><img src="https://manytricks.com/witch/images/4/minor1.png"/></a>
	</p>
	<p><strong>Spring-load</strong> lets Witch do the work for you. Once enabled on the Advanced tab, Witch will automatically drill down and show the selected app&#39;s windows and/or tabs after the specified delay period.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<p><a href="https://manytricks.com/witch/images/4/minor2_big.jpg" title="Access windows from menu bar apps directly in the switcher" data-zoomimagepixelratio="2"><img src="https://manytricks.com/witch/images/4/minor2.png"/></a>
	</p>
	<p><strong>Switch to accessory apps</strong> when they have standard windows open, e.g. our own <a href="https://manytricks.com/moom">Moom</a>&#39;s preferences window when it&#39;s run in menu bar mode. These are typically invisible to the built-in application switcher.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p><a href="https://manytricks.com/witch/images/4/minor3_big.png" title="Control where Witch works and what Witch sees" data-zoomimagepixelratio="2"><img src="https://manytricks.com/witch/images/4/minor3.png"/></a>
	</p>
	<p><strong>Control Witch&#39;s powers</strong> by disabling its hot keys in certain apps, by excluding apps from its switcher, and by hiding unwanted windows—your graphic app&#39;s tools palette, for instance—from the switcher.</p>
</div>

<p>Plus much more: Set the panel&#39;s colors and fonts; define where the panel will appear; act on windows via keyboard shortcuts (H for hide, M for minimize, etc.); and so much more. Give it a test drive now and see all Witch&#39;s switching tricks for yourself.</p>
