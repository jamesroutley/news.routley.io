    <h1>CosAE: Learnable Fourier Series for Image Restoration</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>
            In this paper, we introduce <span>CosAE</span> (Cosine Autoencoder), a novel, generic Autoencoder that seamlessly leverages the classic Fourier series with a feed-forward neural network. <span>CosAE</span> represents an input image as a series of 2D Cosine time series, each defined by a tuple of learnable frequency and Fourier coefficients. This method stands in contrast to a conventional Autoencoder that often sacrifices detail in their reduced-resolution bottleneck latent spaces. <span>CosAE</span>, however, encodes frequency coefficients, i.e., the amplitudes and phases, in its bottleneck. This encoding enables extreme spatial compression, e.g., 64x downsampled feature maps in the bottleneck, without losing detail upon decoding.
          </p>
          <p>
            We showcase the advantage of <span>CosAE</span> via extensive experiments on flexible-resolution super-resolution and blind image restoration, two highly challenging tasks that demand the restoration network to effectively generalize to complex and even unknown image degradations. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its capability to learn a generalizable representation for image restoration.
