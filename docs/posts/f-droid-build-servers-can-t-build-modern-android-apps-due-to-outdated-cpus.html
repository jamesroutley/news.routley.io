    <h1>F-Droid build servers can&#39;t build modern Android apps due to outdated CPUs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>On August 7, 2025, a new build problem started hitting many Android apps on F-Droid. Many Android apps on F-Droid have been unable to publish updates if they use Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) 8.12.0 or Gradle 9.0.</p><p>The root cause: Google’s new aapt2 binary in AGP 8.12.0 started requiring CPU instructions (SSE4.1, SSSE3) that F-Droid’s build farm hardware doesn’t support. This is similar to a 2021 AGP 4.1.0 issue, but it has returned, and now affects hundreds of apps.</p><p>As an example, my open-source app MBCompass hit this issue. I downgraded to AGP 8.11.1 with Gradle 8.13 to make it build, but even then, F-Droid failed due to a baseline profile reproducibility bug in AGP. The only workaround was disabling baseline profiles and pushing yet another release.</p><p>This has led to multiple “maintenance” versions in a short time, confusing users and wasting developer time, just to work around infrastructure issues outside the developer’s control.</p><p>References:</p><p>- F-Droid admin issue: <a href="https://gitlab.com/fdroid/admin/-/issues/593" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.com/fdroid/admin/-/issues/593</a>
