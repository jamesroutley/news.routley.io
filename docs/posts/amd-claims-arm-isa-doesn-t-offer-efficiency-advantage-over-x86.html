    <h1>AMD claims Arm ISA doesn&#39;t offer efficiency advantage over x86</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During the IFA 2025 in Berlin, AMD hosted a media discussion, where one of the topics was the ongoing x86 vs. Arm debate. AMD has argued that x86 processors, both their own and Intel&#39;s SKUs, can offer competitively long battery life in the notebook form factor while maintaining the decades-old x86 software ecosystem. In a now-deleted article from ComputerBase, AMD claimed that the value of the overall package drives power efficiency and battery life, not the instruction set behind the CPU cores. As seen with designs like Intel&#39;s &#34;Lunar Lake&#34; and AMD&#39;s &#34;Strix Point,&#34; x86 designs can deliver significant performance in a power-efficient package, including the GPU and even memory. Below is AMD&#39;s quote for ComputerBase, machine translated to English.</p><blockquote><small>AMD</small>Speaking of efficiency, the topic of Arm vs. x86 came up here, as it does every year. AMD, almost like Intel recently, declared that the myth that x86 can&#39;t be efficient was refuted last year. Both AMD Ryzen and Intel Core can offer extremely long runtimes in notebooks, while accessing the entire x86 ecosystem. Ultimately, the overall package doesn&#39;t offer an advantage for Arm.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/img/oCl7I94GoqFOLZEI.jpg" target="_blank" data-width="1111" data-height="845" data-fancybox="g340779"><img src="https://tpucdn.com/img/oCl7I94GoqFOLZEI_thm.jpg" width="171" height="130" alt=""/></a> </p><p>AMD evaluated using the Arm ISA with K12, but ultimately decided to pursue the x86 route due to the numerous advantages of software. Arm has been carving out a dedicated market share in the PC space slowly with Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon X and NVIDIA&#39;s soon-to-be N1/N1x. However, these are insignificant compared to the number of PCs running x86 today, as well as the volume of notebooks being shipped with an x86 CPU. These notebooks and handheld consoles mostly run on x86, which has disproven the old argument that Arm ISA is more efficient.</p></div></div>
