    <h1>Launch HN: GPT Driver (YC S21) – End-to-end app testing in natural language</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN, we are Chris and Chris from MobileBoost (<a href="https://mobileboost.io/">https://mobileboost.io/</a>). We’re building GPT Driver, an AI-native approach to create and execute end-to-end (E2E) tests on mobile applications. Our solution allows teams to define tests in natural language and prevents test flakiness by taking a visual approach paired with LLM (Large Language Model) reasoning. This helps achieve E2E test coverage with a fraction of the usual effort.</p><p>You can watch a brief product walkthrough here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-Ge2fqdlxc" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-Ge2fqdlxc</a></p><p>In terms of trying the product out: since the service is resource-intensive (we provide hosted virtual/real phone instances), we don&#39;t currently have a playground available. However, you can see some examples here <a href="https://mobileboost.io/showcases">https://mobileboost.io/showcases</a> and book a demo of GPT Driver testing your app through our website.</p><p>Why we built this: working at previous startups and scaleups, we saw how as app teams grew, QA teams would struggle to ensure everything was still working. This caused tension between teams and resulted in bugs making it into production.</p><p>You’d expect automated tests to help, but these were a huge effort because only engineers could create the tests, and the apps themselves kept changing—breaking the tests regularly and leading to high maintenance overhead. Functional tests often failed not because of actual app errors, but due to changes like copy updates or modifications to element IDs. This was already a challenge, even before considering the added complexities of multiple platforms, different environments, multilingual UIs, marketing popups, A/B tests, or minor UI changes from third-party authentication or payment providers.</p><p>We realized that combining computer vision with LLM reasoning could solve the common flakiness issues in E2E testing. So, we launched GPT Driver—a no-code editor paired with a hosted emulator/simulator service that allows teams to set up test automation efficiently. Our visual + LLM reasoning test execution reduces false alarms, enabling teams to integrate their E2E tests into their CI/CD pipelines without getting blocked.
Some interesting technical challenges we faced along the way:
(1) UI Object Detection from Vision Input: We had to train object detection models (YOLO and Faster R-CNN based) on a subset of the RICO dataset as well as our own dataset to be able to interact accurately with the UI. 
(2) Reasoning with Current LLMs: We have to shorten instructions, action history, and screen content during runtime for better results, as handling large amounts of input tokens remains a challenge. We also work with reasoning templates to achieve robust decision-making. 
(3) Performance Optimization: We optimized our agentic loop to make decisions in less than 4 seconds. To reduce this further, we implemented caching mechanisms and offer a command-first approach, where our AI agent only takes over when the command fails.</p><p>Since launching GPT Driver, we’ve seen adoption by technical teams, both with and without dedicated QA roles. Compared to code-based tests, the core benefit is the reduction of both the manual work and the time required to maintain effective E2E tests. This approach is particularly powerful for apps which have a lot of dynamic screens and content such as Duolingo which we have been working with since a couple of months. Additionally, the tests can now also be managed by non-engineers.</p><p>We’d love to hear about your experiences with E2E test automation—what approaches have worked or didn’t work for you? What features would you find valuable?</p></div></td></div></div>
