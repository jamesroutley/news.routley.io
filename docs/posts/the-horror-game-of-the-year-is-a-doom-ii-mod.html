MyHouse starts as expected, in a Middle America clapboard house with healthy shrubs outside and <em>Doom </em>demons inside.

It seems possible that once a game—or, more accurately in this case, a tangle of unshakeable fear, a snake around the neck—has inflamed so many imaginations, real life stops feeling real. People want answers, but they don’t want them to be boring.<br/></p><p>But “it can’t be helped: boredom is not simple,” French theorist Roland Barthes writes in his 1973 book <em>The Pleasure of the Text</em>. “It is bliss seen from the shores of pleasure.”<br/></p><p>As a whole, even with real life attached to it, MyHouse.wad is now an infamous piece of internet horror, though it’s too popular to be tied directly to its creator’s experience<!-- -->. For people that make art, its ability to stand on its own can be terrifying (the map has a mind of its own, after all)—it can feel wrong, but it can also be connective.<br/></p><p>Horror has the same effect. Once you experience that feeling with someone, like letting them sip your favorite cherry Coke, you’re bonded. So while MyHouse.wad may have been an unlikely GOTY contender, its artful, personal horror was always going to bring people together. That’s just what happens when you share something from the heart, as dark as it can be. <br/></p></div></div></div>
