    <h1>What you&#39;ve got is in fact a people problem</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>I do consulting<sup id="fnref:1:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:1:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup> on software architecture, network protocol development,
python software infrastructure, streamlined cloud deployment, and open source
strategy, among other nerdy things.  I enjoy solving challenging, complex
technical problems or contributing to the open source commons. On the best
jobs, I get to do both.</p>
<p>Today I would like to share with you a secret of the software technology
consulting trade.</p>
<p>I should note that this secret is not specific to me. I have several colleagues
who have also done software consulting and have reflected versions of this
experience back to me.<sup id="fnref:2:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:2:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>We’ll get to the secret itself in a moment, but first, some background.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Companies do not go looking for consulting when things are going great.  This
is particularly true when looking for high-level consulting on things like
system architecture or strategy.  Almost by definition, there’s a problem that
I have been brought in to solve.  Ideally, that problem is a technical
challenge.</p>
<p>In the software industry, your team probably already has some software
professionals with a variety of technical skills, and thus they know what to do
with technical challenges.  Which means that, as often as not, the problem is
to do with <em>people</em> rather than technology, even it appears otherwise.</p>
<p>When you hire a staff-level professional like myself to address your software
team’s general problems, that consultant will need to gather some information.
If I am that consultant and I start to suspect that the purported technology
problem that you’ve got is in fact a people problem, here is what I am going to
do.</p>
<p>I am going to go get a pen and a pad of paper, then schedule a 90-minute
meeting with the most senior IC<sup id="fnref:3:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:3:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:3">3</a></sup> engineer that you have on your team. I will
bring that pen and paper to the meeting.  I will then ask one question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is fucked up about this place?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will then write down their response in as much detail as I can manage.  If I
have begun to suspect that this meeting is necessary, 90 minutes is typically
not enough time, and I will struggle to keep up.  Even so, I will usually
manage to capture the highlights.</p>
<p>One week later, I will schedule a meeting with executive leadership, and during
that meeting, I will read back a <em>very</em> lightly edited<sup id="fnref:4:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:4:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:4">4</a></sup> version of the
transcript of the previous meeting.  This is then routinely praised as a keen
strategic insight.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I should pause here to explicitly note that — obviously, I hope — this is not
an oblique reference to any current or even recent client; if I’d had this
meeting recently it would be pretty awkward to answer that “so, I read your
blog…” email.<sup id="fnref:5:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:5:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:5">5</a></sup> But talking about clients in this way, no matter how
obfuscated and vague the description, is always a bit professionally risky.  So
why risk it?</p>
<p>The thing is, I’m not a people manager.  While I <em>can</em> do this kind of work,
and I do not begrudge doing it if it is the thing that needs doing, I find it
stressful and unfulfilling. I am a technology guy, not a people person.  This
is generally true of people who elect to go into technology consulting; we know
where the management track is, and we didn’t pick it.</p>
<p>If you are going to hire me for my highly specialized technical expertise, I
want you to get the maximum value out of it.  I know my value; my rates are not
low, and I do not want clients to come away with the sense that I only had a
couple of “obvious” meetings.</p>
<p>So the intended audience for this piece is potential clients, leaders of teams
(or organizations, or companies) who have a general technology problem and are
wondering if they need a consultant with my skill-set to help them fix it.
Before you decide that your issue is the need to implement a complex
distributed system consensus algorithm, check if that is really what’s at
issue.  Talk to your ICs, and — taking care to make sure they understand that
you want honest feedback and that they are safe to offer it — ask them what
problems your organization has.</p>
<p>During this meeting it is important to <em>only listen</em>.  Especially if you’re at
a small company and you are regularly involved in the day-to-day operations,
you might feel immediately defensive.  Sit with that feeling, and process it
later.  Don’t unload your emotional state on an employee you have power
over.<sup id="fnref:6:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:6:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>“Only listening” doesn’t exclusively mean “don’t push back”.  You also
shouldn’t be committing to fixing anything.  While the information you are
gathering in these meetings is extremely valuable, and you should probably act
on more of it than you will initially want to, your ICs won’t have the full
picture.  They really may not understand why certain priorities are set the way
they are.  You’ll need to take <em>that</em> as feedback for improving internal comms
rather than “fixing” the perceived problem, and you certainly don’t want to
make empty promises.</p>
<p>If you have these conversations directly, you can get something from it that no
consultant can offer you: credibility.  If you can actively listen, the
conversation alone can improve morale.  People like having their concerns
heard.  If, better still, you manage to make meaningful changes to <em>address</em>
the concerns you’ve heard about, you can inspire true respect.</p>
<p>As a consultant, I’m going to be seen as some random guy wasting their time
with a meeting.  Even if you make the changes I recommend, it won’t resonate
the same way as someone remembering that they <em>personally</em> told you what was
wrong, and you took it seriously and fixed it.</p>
<p>Once you know what the problems are with your organization, and you’ve got
solid technical understanding that you really <em>do</em> need that event-driven
distributed systems consensus algorithm implemented using Twisted, I’m
absolutely your guy.  Feel free to <a href="mailto:consulting@glyph.im">get in touch</a>.</p>
