Prague&#39;s Dancing House, finished in 1996, looks like a glass building folding in on itself; his Hotel Marques in Spain, built in 2006, features thin sheets of wavy, multicoloured metal; his design for a business school in Sydney looks like a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-31087980">brown paper bag</a>.</p><p>Gehry won the coveted Pritzker Architecture Prize for lifetime achievement in 1989, when he was 60, with his work described as having a &#34;highly refined, sophisticated and adventurous aesthetic&#34;.</p><p>&#34;His designs, if compared to American music, could best be likened to Jazz, replete with improvisation and a lively unpredictable spirit,&#34; ther Pritzker jury said at the time.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Gehry was awarded the Order of Canada in 2002 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the US, in 2016. </p></div></article></main></div></div>
