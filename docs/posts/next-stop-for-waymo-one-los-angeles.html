We’ve gotten to know many LA neighborhoods, including Downtown and Miracle Mile, Koreatown, Santa Monica, Westwood and West Hollywood, and we’ll begin driving autonomously in several central districts over the coming months as we prepare to serve Angelenos.</p><div><p>We’ll deploy a round-the-clock service that provides more accessible and dependable mobility options to all residents of LA – whether they’re carpooling to work along Pico, catching a ride to the nearest Metro stop, meeting up with friends at The Broad, or taking the kids to Dodger Stadium. </p></div><p>“When we think about our next cities, Los Angeles jumps out,” said Waymo’s co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana. “LA is a remarkable, vibrant place – and Waymo’s experience leaves us best positioned to tackle its driving complexity. We’re working closely with Angelenos to ensure we’re addressing the transportation needs and priorities of their communities as we bring the Waymo Driver to LA.”</p><p>Our operations in Los Angeles build on our unparalleled expertise across both ride-hailing and trucking. Everything we’ve learned over 12 years of autonomous driving has prepared us to serve Angelenos.</p><p>Waymo remains the <a href="https://twitter.com/Waymo/status/1578784789393383424">only company</a> operating a fully autonomous, commercial ride-hailing service for passengers round the clock in Phoenix’s East Valley – no NDAs, remote operators or pre-defined pick-ups. We’re the first and only company in the world providing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/18/waymo-is-expanding-its-driverless-program-in-phoenix/">autonomous ride-hail trips to and from an airport</a> (Phoenix’s Sky Harbor), and we drive more fully autonomous miles in the U.S. than any other company.</p><p>We’ve also autonomously driven millions of miles <a href="https://twitter.com/Waymo/status/1565384559830732803">on freeways</a>, giving us a head start handling some of Los Angeles’s most challenging roads. Roads that include criss-crossing freeway ramps, narrow surface streets, high numbers of unprotected left turns, blinding sunsets down its east-west roads, and distracted drivers. We’re excited to serve Angelenos with an autonomous driving technology that <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2022/09/benchmarking-av-safety.html">outperforms even highly attentive human drivers</a> at avoiding fatal crash scenarios – the Waymo Driver.</p><p>With approximately 13 million residents, the Los Angeles metropolitan area is one of the largest ride-hailing service areas in the world and the third largest in the U.S., with an estimated market opportunity of $2 billion in 2022. As a commercial opportunity, Los Angeles is the equivalent of a dozen smaller U.S. ride-hailing market opportunities combined.</p><p>We’re grateful for the support from key local LA community partners, including MADD California and Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition, and local stakeholders.</p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgell2aKEEPmcaO1N9WiaoUa-NfIcxFwV7_a4RapAk6UBOZob9gjklcjD1Di-GT8_gbVBL07MP8s8dcg3dK9PErNs9ra4OnR_OHqcYcZkQr6JXSnbz8zzp_7pnbNuiu3wau_0uLChj9kcEfn98-GEJLt9dxM1_vdySEu8p0r-f1zw-O2bxFcwgjZGLUug/s1600/EliAkiraKaufman_Waymo.jpg"><img data-original-height="900" data-original-width="1600" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgell2aKEEPmcaO1N9WiaoUa-NfIcxFwV7_a4RapAk6UBOZob9gjklcjD1Di-GT8_gbVBL07MP8s8dcg3dK9PErNs9ra4OnR_OHqcYcZkQr6JXSnbz8zzp_7pnbNuiu3wau_0uLChj9kcEfn98-GEJLt9dxM1_vdySEu8p0r-f1zw-O2bxFcwgjZGLUug/s16000/EliAkiraKaufman_Waymo.jpg"/></a></p></div>
