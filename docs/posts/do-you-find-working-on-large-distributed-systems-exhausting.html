    <h1>Ask HN: Do you find working on large distributed systems exhausting?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Ive been working on large distributed system for the last 4-5 years with teams owning few services or have different responsibilities to keep the system up and running. We run into very interesting problems due to scale (billions of requests per month for our main public apis) and the large amount of data we deal with.<p>I think it has progressed my career and expanded my skills but I feel it&#39;s pretty damn exhausting to manage all this even when following a lot of the best-practices and working with other highly skilled engineers.</p><p>I&#39;ve been wondering recently if others feel this kind of burnout (for lack of better word). Is the expectation is that your average engineer should now be able to handle all this?</p></div></div>
