Writing these posts is a past-time right now as my full time job is educating (mostly) undergraduate college students. I will always
deliver content, but I could really use your help. If you&#39;re willing, please support me at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/sgmarz">Patreon (sgmarz)</a>

I&#39;ve just started and there is much to do! So, please join me!

<h2>Running title: RISC-V OS using Rust</h2>
<p>26 September 2019</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
RISC-V (&#34;risk five&#34;) and the Rust programming language both start with an R, so naturally they fit together. In this blog, we will write an operating system
targeting the RISC-V architecture in Rust (mostly). If you have a sane development environment for RISC-V, you can skip the setup
parts right to bootloading. Otherwise, it&#39;ll be fairly difficult to get started.
</p>
<p>
This tutorial will progressively build an operating system from start to something that you can show
your friends or parents -- if they&#39;re significantly young enough. Since I&#39;m rather new at this I decided
to make it a &#34;feature&#34; that each blog post will mature as time goes on. More details will be added and
some will be clarified. I look forward to hearing from you!
</p>

Future posts about this operating system will be located at <a href="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/category/os/">https://blog.stephenmarz.com/category/os/</a>
</p>
<p>
I changed the github to use <u>tags</u> to mark each chapter. Unfortunately, this was very late into the game. Chapters 1 through 9 are in a directory called chapters. Chapters 10 and 11 are tags in the github repo. Perhaps one day I&#39;ll make all chapters a tag.
</p>
<p>
When finished, you will have an operating system using the RISC-V architecture that schedules
user-space programs from a filesystem, including shell, ls (list files), cd (change directory),
and so forth.
</p>
<p>
This is not intended to be the end-all-be-all, cutting edge operating system, but it is to demonstrate
the efficacy of an operating system using the Rust programming language.
