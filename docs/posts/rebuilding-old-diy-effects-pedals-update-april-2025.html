    <h1>Rebuilding old DIY effects pedals, update April 2025</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>I&#39;ve updated the <a href="https://slinkp.com/guitar-pedal-builds/" rel="nofollow">homemade effects pedals</a>
page with progress - mainly, lots of photos, and info about the
paint experiments I&#39;ve gradually done over
the past few months, which was a nice little crafty project and learning experience.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve gathered some better tools, found most of the parts I need, assessed
what&#39;s what ... and maybe I can actually get these working soon!</p>
