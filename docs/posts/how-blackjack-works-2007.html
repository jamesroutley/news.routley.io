        <h2>A Web-based Blackjack book by Norman Wattenberger</h2>
      </p>
      <p>Testing the concept that a picture is worth a pile of words, this online 
        book takes a look at Blackjack and Card Counting using 145 charts. Simple 
        concepts through advanced techniques are examined. The book won&#39;t teach 
        you a Blackjack &#34;system.&#34; A hundred such books exist. (For a 
        full, free 540-page book that teaches Blackjack from the ground up, see 
        <a href="http://www.qfit.com/book" target="_blank">Free Blackjack Book</a>.) The idea 
        here is to demonstrate the mechanics of Blackjack focusing on the vulnerabilities 
        of both the house and the player. Graphs are used instead of tables of 
        data to provide an instant view of the relative importance of various 
        aspects of Blackjack. From this we can see more clearly areas of exploitation 
        and also the reasons that many card counters don&#39;t make it.</p>
      <p>An online form was selected for this book because full color books are 
        expensive, it makes for an easy reference, and it is trivial to modify 
        and extend. BlackjackinColor is a living document â€” suggestions for 
        changes and additions are welcome at <a href="https://www.blackjackincolor.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#75060005051a07013504131c015b161a18">Suggestions.</a></p>
      <p>Since later pages build on information and explanations in earlier pages, 
        the easiest method of understanding this site is to start with the <a href="https://www.blackjackincolor.com/blackjackfirstcards1.htm">first 
        page</a> and use the Next buttons to travel to the end. Alternatively 
        the index can be used below:</p>
