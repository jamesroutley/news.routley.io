<p><em>According to Chomsky, media operate through five filters: ownership, advertising, the media elite, flak and the common enemy.</em></p>
<p><strong>1 OWNERSHIP</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 ADVERTISING<br/>
</strong>The second filter exposes the real role of advertising. Media costs a lot more than consumers will ever pay. So who fills the gap? Advertisers. And what are the advertisers paying for? Audiences. And so it isn’t so much that the media are selling you a product — their output. They are also selling advertisers a product — YOU.”</p>
<p><strong>3 THE MEDIA ELITE</strong></p>
<p><strong>4 FLAK<br/>
</strong>If you want to challenge power, you’ll be pushed to the margins. When the media – journalists, whistleblowers, sources – stray away from the consensus, they get ‘flak’. This is the fourth filter. When the story is inconvenient for the powers that be, you’ll see the flak machine in action discrediting sources, trashing stories and diverting the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>5 THE COMMON ENEMY</strong></p>
