<div class="storycontent">

<p>Earlier today, all subdomains of lascribe.net, among which the Eggcorn Database & <a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/forum/">forum</a>, and my own language blog <a href='http://serendipity.lascribe.net'>Diacritiques</a> were inaccessible for a while. Permalinks to individual articles were down for altogether about an hour, and the front pages were replaced by web server tool configuration splash screens. Not pretty.</p>

<p>I am trying to figure out from my hosting provider what change on their side caused this. Meanwhile, glad to see we are back online.</p>

This site is devoted to collecting the kind of unusual English spellings that have come to be called <strong>eggcorns</strong>. <i>Eggcorn</i>, the word, is a coinage that goes back to the excellent <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/">Language Log</a>. The <a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/about/">About</a> page retraces the history of the term and offers more information on how this site came to be.</p>

<p>The Eggcorn Database went public on February 15, 2005. It is a collaborative site in the sense that several contributors have access to it. In addition to me, the most active are the long-standing Language Log contributors Arnold Zwicky and Ben Zimmer. The Eggcorn Database has a <a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/forum/">forum</a> now, with its own space for your <a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/forum/viewforum.php?id=3">contributions and submissions</a>. Feel free to register and join in.</p>

			<p>On <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4627">Language Log</a>, Mark Liberman writes:</p>
	<blockquote><p>For most Americans, <em>hurtle</em> is pronounced exactly the same way as <em>hurdle. </em> And <em>hurdle</em>, in addition to being commoner than <em>hurtle</em> (about 7.69 per million for the “hurdle” and “hurdles” in COCA, compared to 0.60 for “hurtle” and “hurtles”), has the advantage of referring to a concrete type of object and a specific associated action.</p>
	<p>This creates the perfect situation for eggcorn creation: a relatively rare and somewhat archaic word that is pronounced in just the same way as another word that is much more common in everyday usage, and has a clear meaning that overlaps at least metaphorically with most examples of the more unusual word.</p>
	<p>If you <em>hurtle</em> through or towards something, you don’t necessarily <em>hurdle</em> any obstacles — but if there were any obstacles in your way, you probably would hurdle them. And the idea of moving quickly without regard for obstacles is not a bad proxy for the usual uses of <em>hurtle</em>.</p></blockquote>
	<p>Commenting on Facebook about another example, Bert Vaux <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10104247525082481">observes</a> that “this is one of those cases like <a href="https://eggcorns.lascribe.net/english/134/hardy/">hearty/hardy</a> where the deneutralization in favor of the voiced option yields a not entirely implausible interpretation.”

			<p><a href="https://brians.wsu.edu/2016/05/25/death-rail/">Paul Brians</a> observes that “‘death nail’ is a result of confusing two expressions with similar meanings,” i.e. <i>death knell</i> and <i>(the last) nail in the coffin</i>. Indeed, <i>nail in the coffin</i> appears to be a heavy influence on <i>death nail</i>, and in some cases the influence is so strong that we could call it an idiom blend. Consider the form “the (last/final) death nail in (someone’s) coffin”:</p>
	<blockquote><p>I would argue that the final death nail in RIMâ€™s coffin was the aggressive pursuit of enterprise customers by Apple. (<i><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3220046/mobile/enterprise-team-management-is-evolving-to-support-a-mobile-workforce.html">CIO</a>, Aug. 28, 2017</i>)</p></blockquote>
	<p>…or, more obliquely, “the death nail in (something)”:</p>
	<blockquote><p>And the Braves can thank him for not allowing Freemanâ€™s injury to be the death nail in their season. (<i><a href="http://www.macon.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/bill-shanks/article157104019.html">Macon Telegraph</a>, June 20, 2017</i>)</p></blockquote>
	<p>In such cases, the “pealing of the bell” sense of <i>death knell</i> has been lost entirely.

	<blockquote><p>The connection to the obsolete cognate of <i>teem</i> as <i>team</i>, for a brood or family, skirts very closely the other, more familiar <i>team</i>, which is present as both noun and verb… So ultimately <i>teem</i> and <i>team</i> are tied to the same origins, though they have followed separate paths for a few thousand years. These connections enliven the following substitutions, that I think are interesting if not striking eggcorns.</p></blockquote>
	<p>Jorkel adds:</p>
	<blockquote><p>The nice thing about a homophone-based eggcorn like â€œteaming with evilâ€ is that it is couched in the right idiom (or in-the-language expression) so that it has a natural feel to it â€¦ and the imagery that the utterer generated works in a credible way. I think sometimes as eggcorn hunters we are tempted to take our homophone list and invent reshapings first (then follow that up with a Google search of a phrase we created). Itâ€™s nice when the eggcorn jumps out and finds us because we have our ears tuned to them.</p></blockquote>

			<p><i>Teem</i> in the sense of ‘abound, swarm’ is etymologically related to <i>team</i>, which in Old English could mean ‘a brood of young animals.’  This eggcorn may seem particularly apt if the collaboration implied by “team up with” involves a large number of people (as in musicians on stage). </p>
	<p>Complicating the picture is the use of <i>teem up</i> to mean roughly the same thing as <i>teem</i>, as in this dialectal example:</p>
	<blockquote><p>“In another hour this placeâ€™ll be teeming up with folks from all over the county and I donâ€™t want no trouble.” — <i><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=RBrPIGBMWcIC">Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</a></i> (1976) by Mildred D. Taylor</p></blockquote>
