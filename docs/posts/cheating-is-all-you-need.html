    <h1>Cheating is all you need</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Heya. Sorry for not writing for so long. I‚Äôll make up for it with 3000 pages here.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm just hopping right now. That‚Äôs kinda the only way to get me to blog anymore.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve rewritten this post so many times. It‚Äôs about AI. But AI is changing so fast that the post is out of date within a few days. So screw it. I‚Äôm busting this version out in one sitting.</p>
<p><em>(Spoiler alert: There‚Äôs some Sourcegraph stuff at the end, including a product plug and some recruiting stuff. But &gt;80% of this post is just about LLMs‚ÄìGPT etc.‚Äìand you, a programmer.)</em></p>
<p>There is something <strong>legendary and historic</strong> happening in software engineering, right now as we speak, and yet most of you don‚Äôt realize at all how big it is.</p>
<p>LLMs aren‚Äôt just the biggest change since social, mobile, or cloud‚Äìthey‚Äôre the biggest thing since the World Wide Web. And on the coding front, they‚Äôre the biggest thing since IDEs and Stack Overflow, and may well eclipse them both.</p>
<p>But most of the engineers I <em>personally</em> know are sort of squinting at it and thinking, ‚ÄúIs this another crypto?‚Äù Even the devs at Sourcegraph are skeptical. I mean, what engineer isn‚Äôt. Being skeptical is a survival skill.</p>
<p>Remember I told you how my Amazon shares would have been worth $130 million USD today if I hadn‚Äôt been such a <em>skeptic</em> about how big Amazon was going to get, and unloaded them all back in 2004-ish. Right? I told you about that? I‚Äôm sure I mentioned it once or twice. Not that I am bitter. No.</p>
<p>But did I ever tell you about the time AWS was just a demo on some engineer‚Äôs laptop? No? Well it was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubeneortega/">Ruben Ortega</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/allan-vermeulen-58835b/">Al Vermeulen</a>. They were walking around the eng department at Amazon, showing their ‚Äúweb service‚Äù demo to anyone who‚Äôd watch it. This was back in maybe‚Ä¶ 2003? Ish? They showed us how you could make a service call over the web, like by hitting a URL and sending the right query parameters.</p>
<p>Well lo and behold we were <em>skeptical</em>. Why the hell would you make a service call over the web? That‚Äôs not what it was even designed for! Not to mention, it <em>obviously</em> wouldn‚Äôt perform as well as CORBA (Amazon‚Äôs stupid-ass RPC system at the time). The whole thing just didn‚Äôt make any sense to us.</p>
<p>We were seeing the first little flecks of lava from what would become a trillion-dollar volcano of money called AWS and Cloud Computing.</p>
<p>But a lot of us were skeptical. To most of us, those little lava flecks looked like fireflies.</p>
<h5 id="the-ultra-rare-trillion-dollar-money-volcano"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-ultra-rare-trillion-dollar-money-volcano"><span></span></a>The ultra-rare trillion-dollar money volcano</h5>
<p>I could tell you a LOT of stories like the web-services one. Great big shit always starts life as a demo.</p>
<p>What about chatting with people in a browser? Doesn‚Äôt matter whether you‚Äôre using Facebook, Google Chat, LinkedIn, or just chatting with a customer service agent: if you‚Äôre having a conversation with someone in a browser, all that shit started life as a teeny demo of 2 engineers sending messages back and forth over a ‚Äúhanging GET‚Äù channel back in 2005. Entire <em>industries</em> were built on that one little channel, and it wasn‚Äôt even very good.</p>
<p>What about Kubernetes? I remember seeing a demo of that early on, on Brendan Burns‚Äô work laptop, when it was called mini-Borg. Entire <em>industries</em> are being built on Kubernetes, and it‚Äôs not even very good either. üòâ Or look at Docker! Something as innocuous as linux cgroups, a little process-isolation manager, became the technical foundation for containers, which now utterly pervade our industry.</p>
<p>If you can build something as big as Amazon Web Services with a stack based on a simple service call, or whole social networks and customer service suites based on simple browser-to-browser communication, or a robust way of delivering and managing software based on a little process isolation code, then just imagine how big a thing you could build ‚Äì bear with me here ‚Äì if you had the <em>goddamn Singularity</em> as your starting point?</p>
<p>I mean, I joke, but‚Ä¶ I mean‚Ä¶ Right? I‚Äôm guessing you prolly missed it in OpenAI‚Äôs 98-page <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf">GPT-4 technical report</a>, but large models are apparently already prone to discovering that ‚Äúpower-seeking‚Äù is an effective strategy for increasing their own robustness. Open the PDF and search for ‚Äúpower-seeking‚Äù for a fun and totally 100% non-scary <a href="https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1637952234913939460">read</a>.</p>
<p>You can build truly massive things by building upon little technical breakthroughs.</p>
<p>And folks, this technical breakthrough? It ain‚Äôt little.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre not pant-peeingly excited <em>and</em> worried about this yet, well‚Ä¶ you should be.</p>
<h5 id="and-yet-the-mehs-prevail"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#and-yet-the-mehs-prevail"><span></span></a>And yet the Mehs prevail</h5>
<p>We did an internal poll at Sourcegraph: Do you have positive sentiment or negative sentiment about LLMs for coding? Options were Positive, Negative, and Meh. And lo, it was about ‚Öî Meh or Negative (i.e., Skeptics), which I suspect is fairly representative of the whole industry.</p>
<p>I asked around, and even as of a couple weeks ago, some devs questioned whether ChatGPT could even write <em>working</em> code, let alone write a full program by simply by telling it to write it.</p>
<p>So here I am, talking about money volcanoes, and my coworkers have formed a huge whirling meh-nado. Which natural disaster should you believe?</p>
<p>Well I mean, I guess a demo is worth a thousand mehs. Let‚Äôs try it out.</p>
<h5 id="chatgpt-vs-emacs"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#chatgpt-vs-emacs"><span></span></a>ChatGPT vs Emacs</h5>
<p>Let‚Äôs have ChatGPT write some Emacs-Lisp code. I‚Äôm picking emacs-lisp because it‚Äôs a corner case language, bit of a stress test for the LLM, and because it‚Äôs easy for me to try it out interactively.</p>
<p>OK. I just typed this prompt into ChatGPT:</p>
<p><em>&gt; Write an interactive emacs-lisp function that pops to a new buffer, prints out the first paragraph of &#34;A tale of two cities&#34;, and changes all words with &#39;i&#39; in them red. Just print the code without explanation.</em></p>
