    <h1>The decentralized web and the future of Section 230</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i><span>This article is part of a symposium of law review articles on Section 230—a 1996 statute that has shaped the internet as we know it. To read the other pieces in this series and learn more about Section 230</span></i><a href="https://www.thecgo.org/benchmark/section-230-symposium/"> <i><span>click here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>
<p><span>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 significantly influenced the present-day internet. It both protects internet platforms from liability for user-created content and encourages them to voluntarily moderate their own communities to restrict access to objectionable content.   </span></p>
<p><span>Without Section 230 protections, internet platforms would have incentives to either remove all but the blandest content, or keep everything, including the filthiest communications.</span></p>
<p><span>In this paper, author Andrea O’Sullivan suggests that Section 230’s liability protections may have encouraged the internet industry to foster centralized platforms that could make content decisions. By lowering the cost of content moderation, liability protections might have artificially induced a technological form that would otherwise be uneconomical. </span></p>
<p><span>Now the internet is pushing towards decentralization that may make Section 230 and centralized content moderation moot. Many technologists have been deeply dissatisfied with the poor levels of user data sovereignty and open communication in the current system. They are seeking to avoid these problems altogether by developing decentralized and open-source alternatives. </span></p>
<p><span>O’Sullivan places the debate over Section 230 in the context of decentralized and federated platforms—networking environments enabled by communally—agreed upon standards of computing and norms. These technologies can give users more control over their platform experience. </span></p>
<p><span>She examines two working projects: the Matrix protocol and the Urbit ecosystem. In these systems, there is no one centralized entity onto which liability could be placed or removed. The user who puts forth the controversial speech is the only one with control over that content.</span></p>
<p><span>Decentralization limits the possibilities of policy. Fewer large third parties to target means more legwork for enforcement. Government agents must find and identify individuals involved with each incident. There are no single clearinghouses that can be captured and controlled. </span></p>
<p><span>The emergence of stable decentralized networking environments should cast many of the unspoken contours of contentious technology policy debates—such as Section 230—in sharp relief.</span></p>
