<p>I have <a href="https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2016/04/on-making-america-great-again/">frequently been critical</a> of the advice given by baby boomers to “do what you love and the money will follow”. After the hard experience of my generation and the ones following it, I think the word has gotten out how terrible that advice is, with books coming out with titles like <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781941393475">Do What You Love and Other Lies</a>. We are now at the point that Freddie deBoer can describe the critique of that advice as “endless”, and <a href="https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/the-socialist-success-two-step?s=r">critique the critique</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>There’s also the endless genre of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/08/do-what-you-love-work-myth-culture/399599/">“don’t do what you love”</a> essays, which critique the omnipresent cultural assumption that you should do what you love. And yeah, that can be exploitative, as employers will often use that love as a means to be selfish with your pay and benefits. But what’s the alternative? Don’t try to get paid doing something you like? Do what you hate? I read Maya Tokomitsu’s book on this question, and like so much of what the socialist left publishes these days it was far more compelling as a critique of what exists than as an argument for a better alternative.</p></blockquote>



<p>These are important questions, and I’m glad deBoer made them because I can see how the critique of the boomer advice could be misinterpreted – or given badly in the first place. (I haven’t read <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781941393475">Tokomitsu’s book</a> myself so I don’t know where it stands on this.)</p>



<p>Here’s the important clarification: As far as I can see, “do what you love”, by itself, is actually <em>good</em> advice. The blatant fabrication, the disastrous harm, comes in the second half of the advice I have typically received: “do what you love <em>and the money will follow.</em>” For most of us, it won’t. Ted Gioia has a <a href="https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/the-disappearing-middle-class-musician?s=r">depressing piece</a> on the “disappearing middle-class musician”: to be a full-time musician these days typically requires that one inherit wealth, or marry someone who can provide one with a means of living. Around the time I <a href="https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2016/04/on-making-america-great-again/">realized I wasn’t going to have the academic career I’d trained for</a>, I saw a friend who’d invested great time and money in a prestigious baking school to become a pastry chef – stuck working the baking section of Whole Foods grocery for $12 an hour. Right around that time, the heartbreak of my generation’s experience was expressed best by – of all people – “Weird Al” Yankovic, whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9xGsYoizbQ">“Skipper Dan”</a> tells the all-too-typical story of a promising actor now stuck working at Disney World. For anyone born after about 1960, “do what you love and the money will follow” has been a recipe for broken dreams.</p>



<p>Now so far I have done exactly what deBoer rightly objects to: providing “a critique of what exists” rather than “an argument for a better alternative.” I now want to turn to the alternative – by which I <em>don’t</em> mean a better socialist world, like <a href="https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/01/a-dream-of-democratic-socialism/">the one Martin Hägglund describes</a> that moves our free time from the realm of necessity into the realm of freedom. I mean, sign me up for Hägglund’s world if we can figure out a way to get there, but Hägglund doesn’t give us such a way, and I have no idea how to get there either.</p>



<p>No, I want to do what I think deBoer is asking for and provide advice about how to live here and now, in the world as it exists. And that is why I think it’s important to say: by all means, do what you love. I think doing what you love is important if not essential for a good life, especially from a <a href="https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/10/naming-the-be-yourself-ideal/">qualitative individualist</a> perspective that values self-expression. It’s just that, in order to survive, you have to make money <em>too</em> – and the money will not <em>follow</em>.   </p>



<p>And so, the advice I would give to young people is this: structure your life so that you have the time and money <em>to</em> do what you love. That’s not easy to do by any means, but it is a much more realistic goal. Making a living <em>from</em> doing what you love is the most obvious way to follow this advice, but in many cases it is not the best way. I congratulate deBoer on succeeding at it, yet I note even he closes <a href="https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/its-a-business-where-you-never-know">another piece</a> with “Don’t be a writer.”</p>



<p>In my own case, when my life was at a crossroads, I found life inspiration in a friend whose job, in his forties, was simply to deliver pizza. The pizza was not the inspiring part: what was inspiring was how clear it was that, for him, his job was not what his life was <em>about</em>. Rather, he wrote and ran a <a href="https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2010/09/to-play-a-flawed-role/">LARP</a> in which, four times a year, a good hundred people would all come together telling a collective story in a post-apocalyptic setting. We would spend seventy dollars to spend the weekend in uncomfortable campsite beds just because his stories, and the shared experience of being a part of them, were so compelling. The experience of playing the LARP gave great joy to many people, including me, for years, though its staff made no money from it. I drew the lesson: <em>this is a good way to live</em>. You can do what you love as an <em>avocation</em>, <a href="https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2009/06/neither-career-nor-hobby/">neither career nor hobby</a>. </p>



<p>And that is the path I have followed myself. I never grew up dreaming of being an educational technologist – I couldn’t have, since the career didn’t exist when I was a kid – but I’ve done well at it, getting promoted to management. It’s not my passion, but it is a job that I like and that I’m good at, which provides me a comfortable living, and I am happy with that. (Indeed I feel comfortable enough at it that I can <em>admit</em> it’s not my passion, which is not an option in many careers.) And it’s left me time to do the writing I love: not only to write this blog (for thirteen years now!) but to write some <a href="https://loveofallwisdom.com/other-writings/">scholarly articles</a> and, now, to write a book I’ll be sending to publishers.</p>



<p>Now for many people the trick with following my path, and that of my LARP-running friend, is that both of us decided not to have children. Rarely does a life leave time or energy for child-rearing, a paid job <em>and</em> a fulfilling avocation. So what if one does feel called to have children? Well, for many parents, raising children <em>is</em> doing what you love, and for many parents that is good enough. But I also think of another friend my age, a mother who has become a published writer of fantasy novels, with multiple trilogies selling well at an estabilshed press. In that, she’s probably the most successful fiction author I know – but as far as I know, even that is not enough to make a living off her writing, not with the high costs of living in metropolitan Boston. Rather, her husband has the job that pays the bills; she writes as an avocation while being a full-time mom. Her life is very different from mine. Yet we still found ways to do what we love – which in both cases was writing – while still following deBoer’s advice not to be a professional writer.</p>
