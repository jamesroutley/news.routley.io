<p>This is a day long course to quickly learn the inner working of hypervisors and techniques to write them for high-performance fuzzing.</p>
<p>This course covers foundation of hardware-assisted virtualization technologies, such as VMCS/VMCB, guest-host world switches, EPT/NPT, as well as useful features and techniques such as exception interception for virtual machine introspection for fuzzing.</p>
<p>The class is made up of lectures using the materials within this directory and hands-on exercises with source code under the <code>Hypervisor-101-in-Rust/hypervisor</code> directory.</p>
<p>This lecture materials are written for the <code>gcc2023</code> branch, which notionally have incomplete code for step-by-step exercises. Check out the starting point of the branch as below to go over hands-on exercises before you start.</p>
