<p>A report by Xona Partners Inc.</p>
<p>July 2024</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>In the early morning of 8 July 2022, Rogers Communications  Inc. (Rogers) experienced a major service outage in its Internet Protocol (IP)  core network that affected its wireless and wireline services across Canada  (July 2022 outage). The July 2022 outage lasted from 4:58 EDT on 8 July 2022 to  7:00 EDT on 9 July 2022 as services were gradually restored. More than 12  million customers lost wireless and wireline services, including mobile  subscribers, home Internet users, corporate customers, and institutional  customers that provide critical services (e.g., Interac e-Transfer and  electronic payment services). </p>
<p>This report details the results of an independent assessment  of the Rogers network architecture for reliability and resiliency<sup id="fn1-rf"><a href="#fn1"><span>Footnote </span>1</a></sup>, as well as the processes in place at Rogers to manage network changes (change  management process<sup id="fn2-rf"><a href="#fn2"><span>Footnote </span>2</a></sup>)  and respond to network incidents like outages (incident management process<sup id="fn3-rf"><a href="#fn3"><span>Footnote </span>3</a></sup>)  as these processes were central to the July 2022 outage.</p>
<p>In this report we detail the findings for the period before  and during the outage and outline the measures that Rogers has since  implemented to address deficiencies in its network design and processes. This  report is primarily based on an extensive independent review of the Rogers  responses to multiple rounds of questions and meetings with the Rogers  technical and management staff during this assessment, as well as information  Rogers provided in response to the CRTC’s request for information (RFI) after  the outage.</p>
<h2>Description of the outage</h2>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> For  context, Rogers operates wireless and wireline networks that share a common IP  core network, as shown in a simplified form in Figure  1.  The core network is part of the telecommunications network that is responsible  for aggregating and routing data traffic both internally within the Rogers  network and externally with the Internet and other service providers. Hence,  for Rogers, both wireless and wireline data traffic is processed by the same IP  core network. In the weeks leading to the day of the outage on 8 July 2022,  Rogers was executing on a seven-phase process to upgrade its IP core network.  The outage occurred during  the sixth  phase of this upgrade process.</p>

	  <summary>Long description</summary>
	  <p>Figure 1 shows a simplified diagram of Roger&#39;s converged core network architecture. In this network architecture, the traffic of both the wireless and wireline networks flows through a common IP core network, which connects to the users of the services offered by Rogers, such as Internet access, telephone service, 9-1-1 emergency service and public alerts service.</p>
</details>


<p><strong>Root cause of the network failure.</strong> The July 2022 outage is  attributed to an error in configuring the distribution routers<sup id="fn4-rf"><a href="#fn4"><span>Footnote </span>4</a></sup> within the Rogers IP network. Rogers staff removed the Access Control List<sup id="fn5-rf"><a href="#fn5"><span>Footnote </span>5</a></sup> policy filter from the configuration of the distribution routers. This  consequently resulted in a flood of IP routing information into the core  network routers, which triggered the outage. The core network routers allow  Rogers wireline and wireless customers to access services such as voice and  data. The flood of IP routing data from the distribution routers into the core  routers exceeded their capacity to process the information<sup id="fn6-rf"><a href="#fn6"><span>Footnote </span>6</a></sup>. The core  routers crashed within minutes from the time the policy filter was removed from  the distribution routers configuration. When the core network routers crashed,  user traffic could no longer be routed to the appropriate destination.  Consequently, services such as mobile, home phone, Internet, business wireline  connectivity, and 9-1-1 calling ceased functioning.</p>
<p><strong>Absence of router  overload protection.</strong> The July 2022 outage exposed the absence of overload  protection on the core network routers. The network failure could have been  prevented had the core network routers been configured with an overload limit  that specifies the maximum acceptable number of IP routing data the router can  support. However, the Rogers core network routers were not configured with such  overload protection mechanisms. Hence, when the policy filter was removed from  the distribution router, an excessive amount of routing data flooded the core  routers, which led them to crash.</p>
<p><strong>Deficiency in the  change management process.</strong> The configuration error, which led to the  removal of the policy filter from the configuration of the distribution  routers, is the result of a change management oversight by Rogers staff. Rogers  staff deleted the policy filter that prevented IP route flooding in an effort  to clean up the configuration files of the distribution routers. The change  management process, which includes audits of change parameters, failed to flag  the erroneous configuration change.</p>
<p>As stated above, this configuration change was the sixth  phase of a seven-phase network upgrade process that had begun weeks earlier.  Before this sixth phase configuration update, the previous configuration  updates were completed successfully without any issue. Rogers had initially  assessed the risk of this seven-phased process as “High.” However, as changes  in prior phases were completed successfully, the risk assessment algorithm  downgraded the risk level for the sixth phase of the configuration change to  “Low” risk, including the change that caused the July 2022 outage. The Low risk  assessment resulted in Rogers staff not being required to conduct additional  scrutiny, go through higher levels of approvals, and conduct laboratory testing  for this configuration change. Downgrading the risk assessment to “Low” for  changing the Access Control List filter in a routing policy contravenes  industry norms, which require high scrutiny for such configuration changes,  including laboratory testing before deploying in the production network.</p>
<h2>Reliability of Rogers network architecture</h2>
<p>The Rogers network is a national Tier 1 network and is  architecturally designed for reliability; it is typical of what would be  expected of such a Tier 1 service provider network. The July 2022 outage was  not the result of a design flaw in the Rogers core network architecture.  However, with both the wireless and wireline networks sharing a common IP core  network, the scope of the outage was extreme in that it resulted in a  catastrophic loss of all services. Such a network architecture is common to  many service providers and is an example of the trend of converged wireline and  wireless telecom networks. It is a design choice by service providers,  including Rogers, that seeks to balance cost with performance.</p>
<h2>Factors affecting network restoration</h2>
<p><strong>Network management  infrastructure.</strong> A management network  provides access to critical infrastructure sites or equipment in a network to  enable troubleshooting and repair. At the time of the July 2022 outage, Rogers  had a management network that relied on the Rogers IP core network. When the IP  core network failed during the outage, remote Rogers employees were unable to  access the management network. Moreover, Rogers did not provision its network  operation centre and other critical remote infrastructure sites with redundant  connectivity from alternative service providers for network management. This  limited access to critical network equipment during the July 2022 outage for  troubleshooting and root cause analysis. Rogers had to dispatch staff to remote  sites to physically access the affected routers, which delayed network recovery  efforts. In our assessment, network resiliency demands that telecom network  operators have secure alternative access to crucial remote network elements  that is not dependent on the data network. Both the inability of Rogers remote  staff to access the management network and the absence of backup connectivity  from alternative service providers to the network operation centre and other  critical remote sites contributed to prolonging the July 2022 outage.</p>
<p><strong>Limited communication  among Rogers staff.</strong> Rogers staff relied on the company’s own mobile and  Internet services for connectivity to communicate among themselves. When both  the wireless and wireline networks failed, Rogers staff, especially critical  incident management staff, were not able to communicate effectively during the  early hours of the outage. Rogers had to send Subscriber Identity Module (SIM)  cards from other mobile network operators to its remote sites to enable its  staff with wireless connectivity to communicate with each other. The absence of  sufficient alternative means of communication slowed the Rogers response to the  July 2022 outage.</p>
<p><strong>Timely access to  critical information for network recovery.</strong> A lack of information hampered the  Rogers incident management process. Rogers staff did not initially have access  to the error logs from the failed routers and could not pinpoint the root cause  for about 14 hours from the start of the outage. Additionally, Rogers had  completed multiple configuration changes during the maintenance window on the  day of the outage. This adversely impacted outage recovery efforts, making it  difficult to decide which network change ticket to roll back. These two factors  contributed to misdiagnosing the root cause of the network failure in the  initial hours of the July 2022 outage. However, once the root cause was  identified, network restoration activities commenced methodically, and services  were gradually restored.</p>
<h2>Measures taken by Rogers to improve its network  reliability and resiliency</h2>
<p><strong>Addressing the outage  root cause and deficiencies in the management network architecture. </strong>In the  months following the July 2022 outage, Rogers undertook a series of measures  and initiatives to address the critical deficiencies that the outage exposed.  Most importantly, Rogers implemented safeguards in the configuration of the  routers in its core network to prevent the flooding of IP routing data, thus  preventing a similar outage from happening in the future. Rogers also  implemented a separate physical and logical management network to access  network elements for troubleshooting and root cause analysis. Additionally,  Rogers deployed backup connectivity from third party service providers to its  network operation centre and other critical remote infrastructure sites, and  invested in tools that would help validate router configuration changes.</p>
<p><strong>Separate IP core for  the wireless and wireline networks. </strong>Following the outage, Rogers announced  it had decided to separate the IP core network for its wireless and wireline  networks. This decision entails deploying a new IP core for the wireless  network, while the existing IP core would remain to serve the wireline network.  Therefore, if one IP core network were affected by an outage, the other IP core  network would remain unaffected and operational. </p>
<p>Rogers has not yet finalized the implementation of the IP  core network separation, which remains a work in progress. When implemented,  separate IP core networks for the wireless and wireline networks will help to  contain a failure to its respective access network and, therefore, avoid the  type of catastrophic network failure experienced in the July 2022 outage, where  both wireless and wireline services were unavailable due to the outage in the  common core IP network. IP core network separation would improve the overall  resiliency of the Rogers wireless and wireline networks.</p>
<p><strong>Improving the change  management process.</strong> Following the July 2022 outage, Rogers made several  improvements to its change management process. These improvements included a new  risk assessment algorithm; organizational changes to improve collaboration  between network operations and engineering teams; an enhanced process for  introducing new equipment and technology; improvements in implementing network  changes such as introducing automation to streamline the change management  process; and additional lab testing of planned network configuration changes.</p>
<p><strong>Improving the  incident management process.</strong> Following the July 2022 outage, Rogers made  improvements to its incident management process, to include bolstering its  incident management guidelines to encompass various outage scenarios;  streamlining its incident response with well-defined leadership roles;  implementing a solution for prioritization of alarms during outage; enhancing  automated rollbacks to previous configurations when new changes are not  successful; and implementing additional measures to improve its communication  protocols. Rogers has also equipped all incident response and crisis management  team members with backup communications from third party service providers to  maintain communication capabilities during outages.</p>
<h2>Assessment and recommendations to Rogers</h2>
<p>Our overall assessment is that the combination of measures  that Rogers undertook after the July 2022 outage are satisfactory to improve the  Rogers network resiliency and reliability as well as to address the root cause  of the July 2022 outage.</p>
<p>Diligence in implementing the improved change management  processes would be the most effective way to avoid a similar outage from  occurring in the future. Enhancements to the incident response processes would  improve the Rogers response to enable a faster service recovery if network  failure occurs. We have several recommendations for additional measures that  Rogers could undertake to further improve its network resiliency. These  recommendations are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Test  emergency roaming with other mobile network operators and expand it to include  a more comprehensive set of test scenarios. Rogers has signed the Memorandum of  Understanding on Telecommunications Reliability, which includes emergency  roaming with other mobile network operators to enable Rogers customers to  access emergency services (e.g., 9-1-1 calls) during a major outage. This  additional testing would ensure that emergency roaming is feasible under  different network failure scenarios; specifically, the scenario observed during  the July 2022 outage (wherein the radio network was up and the core network was  down).</li>
  <li>Develop  a detailed root cause analysis for future major outages. This would benefit the  process of assessing an outage and its impact, as well as identifying the  appropriate mitigation measures. </li>
  <li>Ensure  wide coverage and rigor in testing configuration changes. This would help avoid  errors leading to potential outages. Rogers would need to leverage new test  tools for modeling test scenarios that replicate the production network, and to  address the evolution of networking technologies.</li>
  <li>Expand  the scope of incident management drills. This would enhance staff and network’s  emergency preparedness and proactively uncover weaknesses.</li>
  <li>Institutionalize  learning from its own and other service providers’ network failures to  implement preventive actions, minimize the impact of network outages, and  enhance quality of service. </li>
  <li>Inform  customers how to reach 9-1-1 services during an outage.</li>
  <li>Share  outage root cause and mitigation strategies with the broader Internet community  (represented by bodies such as the North American Network Operator’s Group), to  help other telecom network operators prevent similar network failures.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Recommendations to telecom network operators</h2>
<p><strong>Lessons learned from  the July 2022 outage.</strong> A summary of the important lessons learned from the  July 2022 outage includes: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Implement  router overload protection in the IP core and distribution networks. </li>
  <li>Separate  the network management layer physically and logically from the data network. </li>
  <li>Provide  the network operation centre and other critical remote sites with a secure  backup connectivity from third-party telecom network operators.</li>
  <li>Ensure  that the audit process for network configuration changes is effective and  involves different teams within the organization, such as engineering, operations,  and project management. It is also advisable to involve equipment vendors where  the configuration changes pertain to critical infrastructure, such as the IP  core network. </li>
  <li>Conduct  lab tests of planned configuration changes and ensure that the lab equipment  and test scenarios accurately reflect the production network. </li>
  <li>Carefully  manage the number of configuration changes completed in a single maintenance  window and leverage tools and processes for automatic rollback of configuration  parameters. </li>
  <li>Implement  an automated alarm prioritization solution to suppress unnecessary alarms for  every type of change and to allow staff to focus on the important alarms.</li>
  <li>Provide  critical staff with secondary means to communicate, such as SIM cards from  third-party network operators. </li>
  <li>Simulate  and practice network failure and outage scenarios to uncover deficiencies in  the network architecture and the incident management process.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Evolving telecom  network trends.</strong> There are evolving telecom network trends that impact  network reliability and resiliency. These include the evolutions towards  telecom public cloud platforms, network softwarization and virtualization, the  increased use of Artificial Intelligence in network automation, readiness for  post-quantum cybersecurity, and the convergence of terrestrial and  non-terrestrial networks. Canadian telecom service providers are in the process  of incorporating some of these trends into their network evolution. We  highlight a few technological and process recommendations that would strengthen  network resiliency in the face of such evolutionary network trends. These  recommendations include: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Technological recommendations:
  <ol>
    <li>Leverage  emerging non-geostationary orbit satellite constellations (e.g., low earth  orbit satellite constellations) to provide remote sites with backup  connectivity and consider emerging direct-to-cell constellations for emergency  9-1-1 calling. </li>
    <li>Track  and prepare to implement disaster roaming standards that are currently being  planned in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard setting body.</li>
    <li>Consider  using over-the-top messaging applications as an alternative communication  method, including emergency services. This would be useful in case of failures  in some critical systems, such as the IP Multimedia System.</li>
    <li>Leverage  dynamic software-based SIM technologies, which provide various levels of  programmability and allow new roaming models to alternative providers in case  of major outages. </li>
    <li>Consider  and work towards the applicability of emergency spectrum and capacity-sharing  techniques to mitigate the impact of network failures. These techniques  temporarily and dynamically increase network capacity to accommodate roaming  users.</li>
    <li>Consider  collaborating with content delivery networks and over-the-top application  providers to define specific interaction models during emergencies. For  example, dynamic traffic management allows content providers to adapt their  behaviour based on feedback from telecom operators.</li>
    <li>Consider  offering critical infrastructure service providers secondary options for  redundant connectivity services. </li>
  </ol> </li>
