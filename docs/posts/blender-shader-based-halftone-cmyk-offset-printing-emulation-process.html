    <h1>Blender shader-based halftone CMYK offset printing emulation process</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>MRMO-Halftone is a Blender shader-based halftone offset printing emulation process that aims to evoke the &#34;feel&#34; of color halftone prints.</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg5MzUyNzAucG5n/original/6sYYRM.png" loading="lazy"/></p>
<p>It converts the input texture from RGB to an approximated CMYK color model and overlays the four halftone &#34;screens&#34;, resulting in an emulated halftone offset print.</p>

<p>It works in Eevee and Cycles render engines, and accepts image/video, as well as procedural texture input.</p>

<p>The shader is contained within a single node group with exposed property sliders, and can easily be further reconfigured and customized.</p>

<p>Various properties are exposed in the main shader node, allowing for easy configuration of the basic parameters, such as customizing the halftone pattern dot randomness and rotation, simulating offset mismatch errors, customizing the CMYK &#34;ink&#34; colors etc.</p>

<p>The MRMO-Halftone &#34;Basic&#34; version includes the shader in a .blend scene, with basic configuration options.</p>

<p>The optional MRMO-Halftone &#34;Deluxe&#34; version includes the shader in a .blend scene, with several more advanced customization options, such as per-channel CMYK color multipliers and a handy pre-made, customizable procedural paper texture.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzkwMjYzNDkuanBn/original/ocpt7f.jpg" loading="lazy"/><br/></p>
<p>It&#39;s made to be as easy to use as possible, even for people new to Blender, the .blend scene includes a canvas and camera setup that automatically scales to the desired resolution; the only thing necessary to make it work is to plug in an image, set the rendering resolution and render the result!</p>

<h3>*Update V1.1:</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg5NTIxMzkuanBn/original/6klCt8.jpg" loading="lazy"/><br/></p>
<p>The &#34;Deluxe&#34; version now features additional parameters to tune, including:</p>
<h3>*Update V1.1s:
&#34;Express&#34; update for MRMO-Halftone &#34;Deluxe&#34;!</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg5NTU0ODguanBn/original/9Ze5oJ.jpg" loading="lazy"/></p>
<p>The &#34;Deluxe&#34; version now comes with a simplified-controls &#34;Express&#34; variant as a separate .blend scene. This version features very few controls for more ease-of-use and getting rapid results using the new &#34;quality&#34; parameter.<br/></p>
<h3>*Update V1.21: &#34;Physical&#34; update for MRMO-Halftone &#34;Deluxe&#34;!</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg5OTc5ODMuZ2lm/original/tIWAP2.gif" loading="lazy"/><br/></p>
<p>The &#34;Deluxe&#34; (and &#34;Express&#34;) versions now feature normal and displacement texture based lighting setup, adjustable using the new &#34;paper crumpling&#34; property. (This makes the download size bigger due to the included textures!)</p>
<p>The update also features per-ink specks and dark specks, input texture scaling and several modified property values.</p><h3>*Update V1.23: Better halftone pattern and more!</h3><p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzkwMjY0MDEuanBn/original/K%2BIjbD.jpg" loading="lazy"/><br/></p><p>All versions of MRMO-Halftone now feature a better halftone pattern, and the old &#34;Halftone Pattern Brightness&#34; adjustment is now retooled to &#34;Dot Gain&#34;. The dots in the halftone pattern can now overlap better, providing better and customizable ink coverage.</p><p>The halftone pattern rotation was reworked to feature better default angles.<br/></p><p>A &#34;Soften&#34; adjustment was also added, to help break the hard halftone pattern edges, especially when processing pixel art.</p><p>The Input Image node group also features some adjustment parameters to help tune the input image before it&#39;s sent to the shader process.</p><p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzkwMjYzOTcuanBn/original/AeOX2d.jpg" loading="lazy"/><br/></p>
