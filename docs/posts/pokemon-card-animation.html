		<section><p>A collection of <mark>advanced CSS</mark> styles to create

		<section><h2><em>(Go ahead, try clicking a card to take a closer look!)</em></h2>

			<hr/>

			<p>Under the hood, I&#39;m using SvelteJS to handle interactivity and state; assigning values to
				css custom properties (variables) which in-turn drive the effects and 3d transforms. <a href="https://github.com/simeydotme/pokemon-cards-css">Source code is in the repository</a>, but it&#39;s subject to change as I morph it in to an actual App.
			</p></section></header>

	<h2>Common &amp; Uncommon</h2>
	<p>All cards get a 3d rotation with CSS based on the cursor position.</p>

	<h2>Holofoil Rare</h2>
	<p>Holo cards have an additional <mark>vertical beam holo effect</mark>. </p>

</section>

	<h2>Galaxy/Cosmos Holofoil</h2>
	<p>Similar to the Holofoil, but this uses a special image <mark>background of a galaxy effect</mark>
		with a <mark>gradient rainbow set to color-dodge &amp; color-burn</mark> on top.
	</p>
	<h3>An instant classic for any PTCG fan!</h3>

	<h2>Radiant Holofoil</h2>
	<p>The newest holofoil added to the series! </p>

</section>

	<h2>Trainer Gallery Holofoil</h2>
	<p>The effect for Trainer Gallery holofoils gives it a <mark>kind of metallic effect with iridescent shine</mark>. This is achieved with a <mark>large color dodge linear gradient</mark>, and a
		<mark>hard-light radial gradient</mark> on top, at the cursor position, to give the shimmer.
	</p>

	<h2>Pokemon V</h2>
	<p>V cards have a <mark>diagonal holographic effect</mark> which that appears to travel in opposite
		directions when you tilt the card into the light.
	</p>
	<p>This effect is achieved with <mark>multiple background gradients</mark> and I change the background
		positions based on the cursor x/y. The gradients are set to color-dodge, and there&#39;s a subtle svg
		noise effect.
	</p>

</section>

	<h2>Pokemon V <sup>(Full Art)</sup></h2>
	<p>Similar to the Pokemon V effect, Full-Art cards <mark>use diagonal gradients</mark>, but they
		have <mark>additional texture</mark> when looked at from certain angles. This is achieved with
		an <mark>additional background image with an exclusion filter</mark>. The effect is also more
		vibrant which adds to the metallic look.
	</p>
	<p>The texture effect is not identical to reality as the real cards each have a unique pattern that
		follows the art.
	</p>

</section>

	<h2>Pokemon V <sup>(Alternate Art)</sup></h2>
	<p>Alternate Art Pokemon V cards have <mark>practically the same holo effect as the Ultra Rare (Full Art) cards</mark>. The only difference is the pattern texture.
	</p>
	<p>The effect looks somewhat different though due to the type of artwork.</p>

</section>

	<h2>VMax</h2>
	<p>The gradient effect of Pokemon VMax is more subtle, using a <mark>larger background gradient</mark>
		which moves more slowly. But the <mark>texture effect is more pronounced</mark>.
	</p>

	<section>

</section>

	<h2>VMax <sup>(Alternate/Rainbow)</sup></h2>
	<p>There&#39;s some VMax cards which show a <mark>full, or alternate artwork</mark>. These are
		<mark>classed as &#34;raindbow rare&#34;</mark>
		and have a similar effect to the rainbow cards. It&#39;s a really
		<mark>vibrant and glittery overlay</mark>.
	</p>
	<p>This is achieved with a <mark>background image of glitter/sparkles</mark>, and a texture pattern
		background image, sandwiching the usual linear gradients.
	</p>

	<h2>VStar</h2>
	<p>Again back to the <mark>diagonal gradients overlaying a texture</mark>, VStar are quite
		<mark>similar to teh Ultra Rare</mark>
		(Full/Alt) cards. The cards are generally <mark>brighter with a pastel hue</mark>, though, which
		makes the gradient and texture more subtle.
	</p>

	<h2>Trainer Holo <sup>(Full Art)</sup></h2>
	<p>Again back to the <mark>diagonal gradients overlaying a texture</mark>, VStar are quite
		<mark>similar to teh Ultra Rare</mark>
		(Full/Alt) cards. The cards are generally <mark>brighter with a pastel hue</mark>, though, which
		makes the gradient and texture more subtle.
	</p>

</section>

	<h2>Rainbow Rare <sup>(VMax, VStar)</sup></h2>
	<p>The Rainbow Rare is a <mark>super glittery effect on top of pastel gradients</mark>. This is
		achieved with a background image of glitter/sparkles and a
		<mark>color-burn/hard-light background blend</mark> for some pastel gradients.
	</p>

</section>

	<h2>Secret Rare <sup>(Gold)</sup></h2>
	<p>GOLD! The effect from Rainbow is borrowed, except the color of the gradients, and the filter
		effects (hue) are different. There&#39;s also a different background image with a more subtle
		overlay. This gives a sparkly gold look which is very similar to reality!
	</p>

</section>

	<h2>Trainer Gallery <sup>(V / VMax)</sup></h2>
	<p>The V and VMax cards in the Trainer Gallery are generally quite similar to the normal V and VMax
		cards, so here I&#39;ve just tweaked the values a little and added a different background texture.
