    <p>Chess is booming, and tech is burning to the ground.
It&#39;s inevitable, soon, that Chess is going to acquire the entire tech industry.
And when Chess acquires us, they&#39;ll replace us and take our software engineering jobs.
Then we&#39;ll be stuck playing <em>their</em> game, and we&#39;ll be sitting on those 64 squares.</p>
<p>When Chess takes our jobs, which roles will be filled by which pieces?
We&#39;d better figure out so that we can be prepared for the uprising.</p>
<p><strong>The King</strong>. Ostensibly the most important piece, but it&#39;s relatively useless for <em>actually</em> getting the job done.
It does occasionally come in handy, though.
So this is clearly <strong>the engineering manager</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Queen.</strong> The actual most powerful piece on the board, it&#39;s able to assist in nearly any effort.
It&#39;s very difficult to stop it, and it can solve most problems.
This is my blog, so I&#39;m going to without shame say this is clearly <strong>the staff engineer</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Rook.</strong> Is able to move quickly across the whole board, but can only go in straight lines.
Cannot move diagonally.
It&#39;s kind of like the queen, but not quite as powerful.
Then it&#39;s clearly like the mini-staff engineer, and it&#39;s <strong>the tech lead</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Bishop.</strong> Can effectively see across the board, but can only see half the board.
If it&#39;s on a light square and something is on a dark square, no dice, it can&#39;t help <em>at all</em>.
This is <strong>the product manager</strong>.
Very good at what they do, but not able to see or help with all the technical problems.</p>
<p><strong>The Knight.</strong> Moves in weird ways, jumps over obstacles, passes through the enemy army, and can attack multiple pieces at once.
Is there any question?
This is obviously <strong>the security engineer</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Pawn.</strong> Positioned in front of the rest of the pieces to do the dirty work and protect the territory.
Occasionally they get promoted, but more typically they&#39;re sacrificed for the <del>bottom line</del> greater good.
This is the <strong>line engineer</strong>, whose sole purpose is to do their job, with the distant promise of maybe, someday, getting promoted.</p>
<p>So, okay, maybe these assignments aren&#39;t objectively true.
Do you disagree?
What would you assign to each piece?</p>
