    <h1>Toy CPU Simulator</h1>

<p>I teach university courses part-time, and one course that I teach is MIS 100, where students learn how technology works. For our section on &#34;programming,&#34; I usually talk about programming in very abstract terms, because these are not Computer Science students. But this year, I wanted to try something new.</p>
<p>I hoped to start the &#34;programming&#34; discussion by walking my students through a history of programming, so they could see the next step and how that worked. I tried to find a simple hobby &#34;educational&#34; computer, similar to the Altair 8800, where you input a series of program instructions in &#34;machine language&#34; (binary opcodes) using switches and LEDs. I wanted the instructions to be simple enough that my students could write a few simple programs, like <code>A+B=C</code>, and use that as a starting point to write the same program in Assembly, and in C, and ... you get the idea.
</p>
<p>But I couldn&#39;t find a suitable &#34;Altair-like&#34; SBC for less than $100. There are &#34;Altair&#34; software emulators out there, but they faithfully reproduce the Altair 8800, and that was too much overhead for my needs.
</p>
<p>So I decided to write my own hobby &#34;educational&#34; computer. I call it the Toy CPU.
</p>
<p>I wrote a rough prototype on DOS using character mode, but you couldn&#39;t enter a program on the &#34;front panel.&#34; Instead, you had to hard-code a program into memory, and recompile to run that. It was very primitive, but enough to know that it worked.
</p>
<p>Later, I completely rewrote the Toy CPU using Linux ncurses. This was still a prototype, but this time you could enter a program on the &#34;front panel&#34; by &#34;flipping bits.&#34; It looked okay in ncurses, but I really wanted a graphical program.
</p>
<p>Open Jam 2022 came up at the right time! I decided to completely rewrite the Toy from scratch, using FreeDOS and other open source tools. I don&#39;t use graphical assets per se; instead, the Toy draws the interface elements using basic graphical functions from OpenWatcom (open source). If you&#39;re curious: I used FED (open source) as my editor. I ran FreeDOS inside VirtualBox (open source) running on top of Fedora Linux (open source). Everything in the pipeline was open source.

<p>The theme for Open Jam 2022 is &#34;Light in the Darkness,&#34; which is a perfect fit for the Toy CPU, because of all the blinkenlights!
