    <h1>Janky Apple ID Security</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I had <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/10/23/secondary-apple-id-mess-and-inadvertent-password-reset/">another</a> instance of my Apple ID mysteriously being locked. First, my iPhone wanted me to enter the password again, which I thought was the “normal” thing it has done every few months, almost since I got it. But after doing so it said that my account was locked.</p>
<p>Unlocking the account would require a 1-hour Security Delay, it said, because I had Stolen Device Protection enabled, and I was not at one of my familiar locations. <em>I was at home.</em> But I went to <strong>Settings ‣ Privacy &amp; Security ‣ Location Services ‣ System Services ‣ Significant Locations</strong> to check, and for some reason the <em>only</em> location in the list was the grocery store that I go to once every two weeks. It didn’t figure out the location of the home/office where the phone spends nearly all its time and which is identified as Home in Apple Maps, Contacts, and Find My.</p>
<p>So I went to my Mac, where there was no delay to unlock the account. However, unlocking didn’t work. It had me enter the password, texted a code to my phone, and then wanted me to enter the password again, but the sheet was broken. I typed the password and clicked <strong>Sign In</strong>, and the button stayed grayed out, showed a spinner, and then stopped, but it neither accepted the password nor showed an error. It just got stuck with <strong>Sign In</strong> disabled. Isn’t the new System Settings great?</p>
<p>(Several of the other Apple ID–related sheets have odd layouts and non-standard behavior. If I were not already familiar with this being the unfortunate status quo, I might worry whether they were fake UI trying to phish me.)</p>
<p>(The iPhone version of System Settings also got stuck in a weird state, where the <strong>Apple ID Suggestions</strong> screen was showing a spinner and a <strong>Continue</strong> button that didn’t work. And the whole app was inset with a black border around it. I had to force-quit it. And then it got stuck again the same way.)</p>
<p>The only thing to do was to click <strong>Cancel</strong> to get out of the sheet. Both of my devices kept popping up alerts about signing in to my Apple ID, and I still didn’t want to wait an hour, so I quit System Settings and relaunched it. I followed the exact same procedure as before to unlock my account, but this time it let me do so using my Mac’s password instead of sending a code to the iPhone. And this time the final sheet asking for my Apple ID password worked.</p>
<p>The good news is that the phone automatically unlocked and made the Apple ID services available again. I didn’t have to enter the new password there.</p>
<p>The bad news is that I had to choose <em>another</em> new password for this account. And everything about this process made me feel less secure. If Stolen Device Protection doesn’t work properly, is it going to cause me real trouble sometime? Maybe I should just turn it off. Is there any way I can run my devices <em>without</em> them relying on my Apple ID? Alas, I don’t think so.</p>
<p>(I have another Apple ID that I use on my test Macs, and for some reason it needs to be unlocked <em>every</em> time I use it to sign in to a new installation. I’ve never been asked to reset its password, though.)</p>

<p>WTF #Apple. I’m minding my own business, and get an alert on my watch &amp; phone. “Sign in with your AppleID”.  Ok, why? I enter my password anyway. Then: Locked out. WTF? Then worse. I can’t unlock my account for an hour because I’m not at a familiar location. I’m home. Where I rarely leave. If my home isn’t familiar, where the hell is?</p>

<p>Both of my apple IDs just got locked and hour ago. Passwords were over 2 years old so okay, that’s probably for the best but I changed the first one while taking off from Atlanta and then when I landed in charlotte, my other one also wanted to be changed. Did it on iPad since the lock was active on my iPhone. I have 2 Mac’s at home that will need to be updated to the new passcode when I get home. I thought it’s just because I was out of the country and Apple flagged both.</p>

<p>Not 20 minutes after reading your article the same thing happened to me, including having to set a new password. Weird!</p>
<p>Although I was at home and Stolen Device Protection did recognise that.</p>

<p>I also had this happen to me tonight. Probably a silent forced password reset for an intrusion or something</p>

<p>I got this on an old iPad used for listening to podcasts in the kitchen about 8pm, then all devices were locked. Only after many attempts I got my MBP connected and the iCloud pw reset. Then I could start getting all other devices unlocked with the new password.</p>
<p>It felt more like a hack than something Apple intended.</p>

<p>Apple’s System Status webpage doesn’t indicate that any of its services are having issues this evening. Still, it’s clear based on social media reports that something wonky is going on behind the scenes at Apple.</p>
