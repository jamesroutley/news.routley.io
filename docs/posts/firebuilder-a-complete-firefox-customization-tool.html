        <p dir="auto">I wanted to post a few life updates and share my CS PhD personal statement, in case it&#39;s useful to other folks.</p>
<p dir="auto">I ended up accepting an offer at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://www.gilbertbernstein.com/" rel="nofollow">Gilbert Bernstein</a> in the <a href="https://uwplse.org/" rel="nofollow">PLSE lab</a> to study programming languages for my PhD.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have also been working with a group of friends here in western MA to start a housing co-op and <a href="https://www.valleyhousing.coop/blog/the-coop-is-real" rel="nofollow">just acquired our first property</a>. So I decided to defer starting my program for a year, so I have more time here to tie things up and enjoy a bit more of life here with my community before having to move.</p>
<p dir="auto">I will be coming into my program at 29, unlike many folks who apply directly or a few years after undergrad. I wouldn&#39;t have even thought seriously about applying last year if I hadn&#39;t <a href="https://github.com/saulshanabrook/saulshanabrook/discussions/28" data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/saulshanabrook/saulshanabrook/discussions/28/hovercard">received a CS Grad 4 US NSF fellowship</a>. And I wouldn&#39;t have applied to that, if not for my participation in the e-graphs community and at the encouragement of some folks in the lab at UW. I am also appreciative of the folks who wrote my recommendation letters and friends who helped edit my statement and generally be open to my existential phone calls about what I am doing with my life.</p>
<p dir="auto">Writing my personal statement was a chance for me to practice a different relationship with writing than I have had in the past and I found it useful as a tool to get clear about why I am interested in making this choice and how all those pieces connect. I enjoyed slipping in a reference to <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/living-at-the-edges-of-capitalism/paper" rel="nofollow">“Living at the Edges of Capitalism: Adventures in Exile and Mutual Aid”</a> by Andrej Grubacic and Denis O&#39;Hearn, as it relates to open source communities. Let me know if you manage to get your own anarchist citation into yours!</p>
<p dir="auto">I also wanted to share <a href="https://saul.fibery.io/@public/Academia/Schools-29" rel="nofollow">a list</a> I put together of all the schools I was applying to and what professors are at each. I started creating it as I was researching different schools, to keep track of who was where, and found it useful to keep up to date throughout the process, as I heard back from places.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are also applying to schools this year, good luck! I hope by sharing this it could be helpful to folks, especially those coming from non-traditional backgrounds, that there might be a place for them too in the weird world of academic computer science. Feel free to <a href="https://calendar.app.google/ZKFmuX1AhojALaTQ9" rel="nofollow">reach out to me</a> if you have any questions or just want someone to talk to about it. Maybe I will see you next year at UW?</p>

<p dir="auto">I am applying to your Ph.D. program to research programming languages and formal methods, driven by my involvement in the open-source community. In particular, I am interested in studying the structures that represent the semantics of Python libraries in data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. My experience working in this open-source community has prepared me to integrate theoretical research with practical applications. Researching the design and implementation of abstractions for domain-specific libraries can help preserve the independence and growth of decentralized multi-stakeholder Python libraries. I aim to explore how computer science and mathematics can offer a precise language to describe and manipulate the abstractions used in the field. Pursuing this research at the University of Washington would provide a collaborative environment to engage in academic research to meet the real-world needs of the open-source community.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have experience in the combination of research, community engagement, and addressing real-world user needs through my participation in open source, particularly with JupyterLab and Vega. Starting with a personal initiative to enhance the collaboration of my research group, I contributed to integrating the Vega-Lite visualization tools into JupyterLab, collaborating with project creators Dominik Moritz and Brian Granger. I relied on these relationships to build a general-purpose, open-source tool for Python data science users to optimize their interactive visualizations based on the needs of a database client. This improved Vega&#39;s debugging capabilities and contributed to published research on visualization profiling.  As a core JupyterLab developer, I helped clients integrate with the Jupyter ecosystem and shared the responsibility of maintaining and enhancing the project. For example, I wrote and received a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative grant to improve the collaborative experience in Jupyter, leading to an integration of conflict-free replicated data types into JupyterLab. Overall, I enjoyed the opportunity to integrate research and user needs while navigating complex multi-stakeholder projects.</p>
<p dir="auto">My engagement in the open-source Python data science community motivates my research on the interrelated technical and social challenges it faces. The shift toward heterogeneous hardware has increased the complexity of developing numeric libraries and led to fragmentation in the ecosystem, centralizing control in single-stakeholder projects like Jax, PyTorch, and Mojo. The &#34;exilic spaces,&#34; as defined by O’Hearn and Grubačić, of decentralized democratic open-source projects based on mutual aid and cooperative relationships, are a powerful living alternative to the market economy. By protecting them through tools that promote a bottom-up ecosystem to meet user needs and facilitate innovation, we can engage in the vital practice of navigating the difficulties of democratic governance. I hope my work can play a role in increasing the diversity and accessibility of the ecosystem by building tools that strengthen its independence.</p>
<p dir="auto">My path towards exploring how programming language abstractions can aid the PyData community began at Quansight. Working with Travis Oliphant, creator of NumPy, we sought to research a new foundation for the array ecosystem in Python. I reached out to Lenore Mullin, based on her 1980s work on the &#39;Mathematics of Arrays&#39; formalizing APL with the lambda calculus, and we ended up working together to integrate her work into Python. This led to the development of a generic framework, metadsl, for representing and optimizing expressions in Python, but securing funding for this type of experimental technology proved challenging. While at Quansight, I also assisted the Data APIs consortium with analyzing the usage of array API patterns in Python, giving me the opportunity to witness the difficulties in providing users with universal interfaces. After leaving Quansight, I joined a startup Linea that was working to bring database and programming language theory to assist Python data scientists. As one of their first engineers, I engaged with academic researchers as the leader in developing Linea’s abstract analysis engine, which transformed Python code into a functional dataflow graph in order to support program slicing and lineage analysis. After leaving Linea, I re-focused on developing a system for abstract interpretation in Python. I learned about the work on e-graphs from the University of Washington, a technique that comes from equational reasoning. I wrote a Python library exposing the research software to a broader audience and presented it at the E-GRAPHS workshop at PLDI. I also developed an interactive visualizer, now integrated into the project, to make the work more accessible. To deepen my academic collaboration, I applied for and received an NSF fellowship to support pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science.</p>
<p dir="auto">My ongoing work with e-graphs in Python gives me a jumping-off point for my overall research goals in pursuing a Ph.D. In egglog, the framework building e-graphs on top of datalog, I am interested in studying the addition of parameterized types and higher-order functions to improve expressivity and the relationship to existing compute engines, such as SQL and differential dataflow. I also want to explore how existing functional abstractions like the Mathematics of Arrays and the RSVDG can be implemented within the e-graph framework to provide a general-purpose compiler framework for numeric computation, AI, and data science. More broadly, I am interested in studying, through the lens of human-computer interaction, how frameworks for type-driven programming can assist in cross-domain and language translation to assist inter-group collaboration between library developers, as well as how concepts from the foundations of mathematics can help give us the language to reason about the semantics of programming languages.</p>
<p dir="auto">More specifically, at the University of Washington, I am interested in working with Zachary Tatlock, Gilbert Bernstein, Dan Grossman, and Luis Ceze on studying the abstract interpretation and compilation of machine learning code in Python. Moreover, I want to connect the academic programming language community closer with the Python ecosystem, a high-impact field that would benefit from a foundational approach to studying abstraction. By enrolling in your graduate program, I could develop longer-term working relationships with other researchers in an environment supportive of experimentation and thus connect abstract research with the needs of existing open-source communities.</p>
