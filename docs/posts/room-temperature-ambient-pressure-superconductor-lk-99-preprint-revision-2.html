            <span>Abstract:</span>  A material called LK-99, a modified-lead apatite crystal structure with the
composition Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_{6O}$ ($0.9&lt;x&lt;1.1$), has been
synthesized using the solid-state method. The material exhibits the Ohmic metal
characteristic of Pb(6s1) above its superconducting critical temperature,
$T_c$, and the levitation phenomenon as Meissner effect of a superconductor at
room temperature and atmospheric pressure below $T_c$. A LK-99 sample shows
$T_c$ above 126.85$^\circ$C (400 K). We analyze that the possibility of
room-temperature superconductivity in this material is attributed to two
factors: the first being the volume contraction resulting from an
insulator-metal transition achieved by substituting Pb with Cu, and the second
being on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction enhanced by the structural
deformation in the one-dimensional(D) chain (Pb2-O$_{1/2}$-Pb2 along the
c-axis) structure owing to superconducting condensation at $T_c$. The mechanism
of the room-temperature $T_c$ is discussed by 1-D BR-BCS theory.
