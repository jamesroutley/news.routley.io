We regret to inform you that as of December 27, 2024, the Bench platform

    disruption, so we’re committed to helping Bench customers navigate through
    the transition.

From the entire team at Bench, it has been an absolute privilege to serve
    small businesses for the last 13 years. Thank you for being part of our
    journey.
