		<p><strong>Shopping for supplements is hard. Nootritious Shop puts the power back in your hands, the consumer. We help you determine the best supplements by making hidden information visible. We provide insights that go beyond the marketing claims so you know what you’re putting in your body. We keep companies honest. Our website is created by nutritionists and dietitians in training in addition to consultation from medical doctors. Feel free to contact us at ask@nootritious.com if you require clarification.<br/></strong></p>
<p>Despite the name, we are not a shop, we link products that are sold elsewhere on the internet, usually Amazon.</p>
<h3>1) Which brand to buy?</h3>
<p>So you’ve gone to a medical professional and they’ve recommended you to take some magnesium and vitamin D with K2 for general health. What now? If you’re like most people, you want a high quality product at a fair price. We evaluate brands based on their ingredient quality, and evaluate price / standardized serving to avoid confusion with inconsistent serving sizes. We also provide information on pill sizes and warnings when pills may be too large. In addition we provide a daily/weekly/monthly intake cost estimate.</p>
<h3>2) How do I take?</h3>
<p>Dosage instructions are often vague, and can be actively detrimental at times. They are also unspecific to the individual. A 200 pound adult male shouldn’t be taking the same dose as a 120 pound female. We provide dosage ranges (dose/kg) that are standardized according to the best studies. When you take certain supplements can greatly affect the benefits or in some cases can exacerbate the side effects. We provide evidence based timing for all supplements we review on this site. Our advice is vetted by doctors and/or nutritionists.</p>
<h3>3) Best combination of supplements to take</h3>
<p>We read a lot of studies, conducted by those working on the cutting edge. In many studies, combination doses of popular supplements have been determined to be more effective than isolated intake. Whether you’re an athlete, office worker or simply wanting to feel better, we provide information on these combinations in our reviews. We provide warnings on drug interactions where they are present.</p>
<h3>4) Explore</h3>
<p>We’ve indexed a wide range of popular health supplements by category, and reviewed most of them. The supplement brands we choose are approved for quality and are in many cases, personally tested.</p>
<h3>5) Where to buy supplements</h3>
<p>Unless the supplement is on a heavily discounted sale, it is usually cheaper to buy it online. Nootritious Shop links to supplements that we review, through an affiliate link. We always try to link to the lowest price available, whether this is through Amazon or iHerb. Our links are continually updated and vetted to ensure you get the best price.</p>
<h3>Don’t know where to start?</h3>
<p>If you aren’t sure where to start, we’re here to help! Nootritious has identified companies that score highly on ingredient quality, manufacturing standards and overall transparency in our company guides. Look for the badge of approval – this means a company readily provides information on their manufacturing processes and ingredients through a publicly-available third party analysis on their website. They must also provide ingredient sourcing on the label to receive the badge of approval.</p>
