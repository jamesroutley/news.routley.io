            “Our research shows that people who use cannabis, particularly those with a cannabis use disorder, are significantly more likely to develop head and neck cancers compared to those who do not use cannabis,” said senior study author Dr. Niels Kokot, a professor of clinical otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

            <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/29/health/medical-marijuana-cannabis-use-disorder/index.html">Cannabis use disorder</a> is diagnosed when a person has two or more of such symptoms as craving weed, becoming tolerant to its effects, using more than intended, using marijuana even though it causes problems in life, using it in high-risk situations, experiencing withdrawal and being unable to quit, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/health-effects/cannabis-use-disorder.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/marijuana/health-effects/addiction.html" target="_blank">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.

            “While our study did not differentiate between methods of cannabis consumption, cannabis is most commonly consumed by smoking,” Kokot said in an email. “The association we found likely pertains mainly to smoked cannabis.”

            Some 69% of people with a diagnosis of <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/oralcav.html" target="_blank">oral or throat cancer</a> will <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/oralcav.html" target="_blank">survive five years or longer </a>after their diagnosis, according to the <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/oralcav.html" target="_blank">National Cancer Institute.</a> If the cancer metabolizes, however, that rate drops to 14%.

            The study used insurance data to look at the association of cannabis use disorder with head and neck cancers, said Dr. Joseph Califano, the Iris and Matthew Strauss Chancellor’s Endowed Chair in Head and Neck Surgery at the University of California, San Diego. He was not involved in the study.

            “The researchers used a huge, huge dataset, which is really extraordinary, and there is enormous power in looking at numbers this large when we typically only see small studies,” said Califano, who is also the director of UC San Diego’s Hanna and Mark Gleiberman Head and Neck Cancer Center.

            “On average, people with cannabis use disorder smoke about a joint today and do so for at least a couple years, if not longer,” said Califano, who <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaoto.2024.2419?guestAccessKey=6cb564cb-8718-452a-885f-f59caecbf92f&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=080824" target="_blank">coauthored an editorial</a> published Thursday in JAMA Otolaryngology–Head &amp; Neck Surgery in conjunction with the new study.

            Tobacco use, which includes smoking cigarettes, cigars, pipes and smokeless tobacco, and the use of alcohol are the two most common causes of head and neck cancers, experts say. Other risk factors include poor oral hygiene;<strong> </strong>gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD; a weakened immune system; and a diet low in fruits and vegetables. Occupational risk factors include exposure to asbestos and wood dust.

            A growing number of head and neck cancers are due to infection with the human papillomavirus or HPV, or the Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, which are DNA viruses that affect genes, making them susceptible to malignancies.

            Epstein-Barr virus is linked to infectious mononucleosis, also called the “kissing disease,” as well as various cancers.

The findings held true for all age groups, according to the study.

            Smoke is one key reason for the association between smoking weed and head and neck cancers, experts say.

            Another key to the puzzle of how cannabis causes cancer: Research has found a link between various cannabinoids and tumor growth. There are <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/cannabis-marijuana-and-cannabinoids-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank">more than 100 cannabinoids</a> — biological compounds in the cannabis plant that bind to cannabinoid receptors in the human body, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.
