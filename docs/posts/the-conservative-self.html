    <h1>The Conservative Self</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<blockquote>
<p>To understand what we call the Self, we first must see what Selves are for. <em>One function of the Self is to keep us from changing too rapidly.</em>..If we changed our minds too recklessly, we could never know what we might want next. We’d never get much done because we could never depend on ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider Hickey’s <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-materials-paradigm-and-epochal-time/">epochal time model</a>:</p>

<p>What is the function here of Identity (i.e., the Self)? What makes a succession of states more than just a sequence of values?</p>
<p>Consider <em>identity</em> = <em>id</em> + <em>entity</em>. That is, an identity is a unique instance (with a primary key <em>id</em>) of an <em>entity</em> of a certain type.</p>
<p>What makes something an entity of a certain type? It must satisfy an <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/schema/schema.html#entity-specs">entity spec</a>, i.e. maintain model invariants, including but not limited to the syntactic schema.</p>
<p>Can something have multiple “id-entities”? Sure. Something can be a Study with ID 123 as well as an Activity with ID 234 if (a) each value over time passes validation as both a Study and an Activity, and (b) each value over time resolves to the same unique individual within each of the Study and Activity model abstractions – i.e., as a function of the data attributes that these models choose to consider in order to distinguish individuals, each value is a “state” of “the same” individual.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ttl"><span># expression of a non-unique name assumption</span>
<span>study</span>:<span>123</span> owl:<span>sameAs</span> <span>activity</span>:<span>234</span> .
</code></pre></div><p>To achieve conservation of id-entity, to successfully associate an id-entity – an identity – with a sequence of values, to proclaim that sequence to be a succession of states, is to feel confident that certain model invariants are being maintained across the values&#39; history, that change is not reckless, that one can depend on something.</p>
