    <h1>Show HN: Use Go&#39;s HTML/template to write React-like code</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#39;m currently working on my hobby project, and one of the fun constraints I put in was to build using as less dependencies as possible.</p><p>I chose Go as it has a really good standard library, and all went well for building backend. But for frontend, I was wondering whether I should break the constraint and go for React. I tried options like Web Components, but I really didn&#39;t like the ergonomics and I didn&#39;t want to use jQuery either.</p><p>Out of curiosity, I was exploring Go&#39;s html/template package to see if I can write UIs in a React-like manner. I found most of the online docs using the &#34;slots&#34; like approach which I found unintuitive.</p><p>But after trial and error, I found an approach that&#39;s very close to React and without using any 3rd party packages like templ.</p><p>I&#39;d like to share this with the community, not sure if it&#39;s a common approach - <a href="https://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/react-like-composition-using-go-html-template/" rel="nofollow">https://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/react-like-composition-using...</a></p></div></div></div>
