        <p><strong>Sir Frank Williams – the longest-serving Team Principal Formula 1 has ever seen – has died at the age of 79.</strong></p>

<p>Sir Frank marked 50 years as an F1 team boss in 2019, having run two teams in that time, the latter of which went on to win seven drivers’ titles and nine constructors’ championships.</p>

<p>The Briton and his family, including daughter Claire who had run the team on a day-to-day basis since 2013, left F1 earlier this year after they sold the team to investment firm Dorilton Capital.</p>

<p>Sir Frank, who sustained a spinal cord injury in a car crash in 1986 that rendered him unable to walk, began reducing his workload in F1 in 2012, when he stepped down from the Williams board.</p>

<p>Claire took over as the family representative and was later appointed Deputy Team Principal looking after the day-to-day running – however Sir Frank retained the Team Principal title.</p>

<p>He spent some time in hospital in 2016 recovering from pneumonia and subsequently stopped travelling to races. He was also admitted to hospital in December last year.</p>
