      <p id="4986a651-2f0d-49d5-8d4d-bd64274bf142">It has been few days, since I created the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/">/r/cyberDeck</a> subreddit. I did so, partly because I was inspired by the <a href="http://www.activewirehead.com/building-a-cyberdeck/">Building a cyberdeck</a> article, but also because of few IRC discussions I participated, and because I think that there is more to this idea, than just nice cyberpunkish look and feel.</p>
      
      <p id="1d22ecd9-cae9-4922-97dd-302e1bfb7e83">Deck or CyberDeck is this mobile computer first imagined by William Gibson in Neuromancer and later slightly extended and redefined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a> as well as other (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2020">Cyberpunk 2020</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS_Cyberpunk">GURPS Cyberpunk</a>) role-play games, card games (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netrunner">Netrunner</a>) and novels.</p>

        He snugged the surgical steel jack into the socket at his temple and his fingers flew across the keyboard of his Fuchi cyberdeck, launching him into the Matrix. His vision shifted to that dazzling electronic world of analog space where cybernetic functions took on an almost palpable reality. He ran the electron paths of cyberspace up the satellite link and down again into the Seattle Regional Telecommunications Grid. Within seconds, he was well on his way to the rendezvous with his companions inside the Renraku arcology.

        Sam slid back the cover panel and pulled out the telecom connector. With a quick switch of plugs, the Elf&#39;s cyber-deck took the place of Castillano&#39;s computer. He reached for the datacord that would connect his socket with the deck. He almost changed his mind, but found courage when he remembered the innocents in the arcology who would suffer if no one tried to help. He slipped the plug in, steeling himself against the expected pain.</blockquote>

Almost no one knows what to do with them, but they are cool, flashy, with efects never seen before. Talking heads in TV talk about Hackers and information superhighways, and everyone is curious and anything seems possible. It really makes your fantasy going.</p>

      <p id="b15cdd09-1af4-4c7b-9b22-6c1cbf643fe2">So, why would anyone want to use deck and not a notebook?</p>
      <p id="ecb927bf-fed0-4bc4-87ea-3794847d4a29">The idea of usefulness of the deck came to me from the opposite direction, than to most of the people I guess;</p>
      <p id="a38e5309-b12a-41de-9d75-0e0b5f3082c3">I was thinking a lot about what does being „digital nomad“ mean and what would be required to be truly independent, but not to give up comfort of having two displays, one of which is big 27&#34; LCD. I work as a programmer (did you know, that there is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HMDprogramming">/r/HMDprogramming</a>? :)), and big monitor directly contributes to my productivity. I really <strong>need</strong> a lot of space for editor, terminals and other stuff I deal with.</p>
      <p id="c6182706-61d3-488c-9c72-570a4599a8d5">Consider following example:</p>
      <figure id="9b6849b6-7c14-43fe-b508-8b5bdface196">
        <a href="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Hardware/Cyberdecks/Untitled_27.png" title="Untitled_27.png"><img src="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Hardware/Cyberdecks/Untitled_27_thumb.jpg"/></a>
      </figure>
      <p id="c40657a4-1f1e-4c44-b1ee-734734e1ab2b">And that&#39;s just one of 16 virtual desktops I use, others filled with documentation, server connections, database consoles and similar stuff. If you try to cram all that stuff on notebook screen, it just isn&#39;t right and context switching can get annoying really quickly:</p>
      <figure id="4bb09791-07ff-4903-96b8-60f550ccc50c">
        <a href="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Hardware/Cyberdecks/Untitled_28.png" title="Untitled_28.png"><img src="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Hardware/Cyberdecks/Untitled_28_thumb.jpg"/></a>
      </figure>
      <p id="95faeaba-1bd6-4942-b742-16a7e15af095">So I was thinking; Would it be possible to have all the comfort of big screen and still live like a nomad, always on the road? Pretty soon, it was obvious, that you would have to have either big caravan (or maybe a camel with LCD holder :P), or HMD display.</p>
      
      
      <p id="42a34008-646d-41ce-8e7c-7366f23166f3">(This year should be good year for Head Mounted Displays. From left to right: <em>HTC Vive</em>, <em>Oculus Rift</em>, <em>Sony project Morpheus</em>, <em>Razer OSVR</em>, <em>Rapture HMD</em> and <em>Avegant Glyph</em>.)</p>
      <p id="ea657bae-2a4f-4cf2-81ee-e8e53b6df935">But most of the notebooks will have problems to handle the HMD, because of high requirements on GPU, which also means high power consumption (that is also true for decks, but you are not limited by screen size and the size limits for notebooks). Also, the idea of having the display and the HMD at the same time is just pointless. You won&#39;t see it with HMD on, and it would just consume power for no reason. That&#39;s how the idea of decks came into my mind.</p>
      <p id="6344f09d-f47b-4dad-8b09-4aca609e3c5b">I think, that in the near future, there is relatively big fraction of computer market share for the decks, because HMD&#39;s will be more and more common, but I don&#39;t think, that we will see them often sooner than 10 years from now.</p>

Whole IDE is really strongly space and visually oriented. After I&#39;ve played with it a little, I must say, that it (or Smalltalk) would do a really nice desktop environment for 3D system.</p>

      <p id="158db227-fc50-4ff0-8ad3-67a0f02d1338">Of course, this probably wouldn&#39;t be user-friendly and thus usable for most of the people. But my idea of the deck was never meant to be. Such project would have to have custom, DIY hardware, only for real enthusiast. It would be much more interesting, if the software would be also highly customized programmer-only thing, completely ignoring the normal users and their principles of operation. As the <a href="https://www.abclinuxu.cz/images/screenshots/7/4/217947-cyberdecs-7902521666826599726.jpg">image</a> from the Neuromancer graphic novel says: <em>&#34;The meat stayed home, strapped to a</em> <em><strong>custom</strong></em> <em>deck&#34;</em>.</p>
      <p id="6ce4ea64-7242-40aa-8cd1-449b526c165a">Once I found this think-path, I couldn&#39;t just stop there. When you realize, that you don&#39;t need to limit yourself with standard notebook parameters, you may actually imagine completely new device with more completely different features, which makes sense only with the concept of decks. Pretty quickly, I&#39;ve got something qualitatively different from standard consumer notebooks.</p>

      <p id="272b745a-2002-4371-9e59-f882da53a634">For example - typical notebook have one shitty webcam used for video calls. With the decks, you may actually want something like four or six hi-res webcams, to provide you with situational awareness, when you have the HMD on. In the virtual reality, imagine this as big sphere around you. There are some floating windows, between you and the sphere, and at sphere itself, there may be output from the cams showing your surroundings. The cameras could also in theory be used to track you and your hands and map you into the 3D environment, leapmotion style.</p>

      <p id="a45f0f28-06fd-401a-a39e-7f4433d8e7cd">Keyboard could be detachable and the deck could track its position and position of your HMD, using the same <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/reverse-engineering-oculus-rift-dk2-positional-tracking-camera-linux-sdk/">LED trick</a> Oculus uses, so it could render its virtual form into the 3D environment.</p>
      <p id="80efd046-0b05-451c-99b2-c927ba371b9d">There could be built-in Leapmotion / Kinect -like sensors, which would sense hand motions, so no gloves would be required. It would be also nice to have small e-ink display, as the system console, for debugging and system-info purposes.</p>
      <h3 id="864c58fc-90b8-492c-92ed-6d3498142348">Crazy stuff</h3>
      <p id="4ebe4eb9-58c8-4859-89e2-7a4b631844b2">Instead of cheap WiFi card, there could be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Software_Radio_Peripheral">USRP</a> (really good Software Defined Radio) card, combined with FPGA, so you could actually take the deck into the field and let it be useful in hacking / tracking / capturing of the signals. Of course, it could also emulate the WiFi / Bluetooth / Zigbee device, with right software.</p>
      <p id="d9696b0d-892f-4a63-bf62-4b4e7ecd8e9b">Since this wouldn&#39;t be the standard consumer hardware built for multimedia / gaming, it would be possible to use some really alternative computing platform, like this sweet 18 core low-power Parallella computer board.</p>

      <p id="75707c9f-c3c7-402c-b9d3-9e18b820901d">Only thing, that is really mandatory is high-end GPU, possibly mobile. There is no way around it, if you would want to have enough processing power to support smooth 3D environment in the HMD display. This is one of the reasons, why we don&#39;t see many of the decks today, and in the near future. GPU is simply too much greedy.</p>
