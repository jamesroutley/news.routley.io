    <h1>YYMMDDHHMM just overflowed a signed 32 bit int</h1>
    
    
<p>
I guess I've turned into a collector of numbers that break things 
sometimes.  Here's another one I just heard about, and it's directly 
related to what just happened with the calendar.
</p><p>
YYMMDDHHMM ... will no longer fit into a signed 32 bit number.
</p><p>
The last value for last year is December 31, 2021 at 23:59, and in this 
format it becomes 2112312359.  That just fits into a signed 32 bit 
number (which tops out at 2147483647).
</p><p>
The first value for this year is January 1, 2022 at 00:00, which turns 
into 2201010000, and that does not fit!
</p><p>
So, if you're using Microsoft Exchange and stopped getting your mail in 
the past couple of hours, this is why!

Happy 2022, everyone.
