I believe this is connected to becoming an adult and feeling a bit confused about what to do.</p><blockquote><p><em>What should I study? </em></p><p><em>What career path should I take? </em></p><p><em>Where should I live?</em></p></blockquote><p>These are all hard questions to answer that leave you in a sort of limbo, and there’s a high chance you’ll start procrastinating.</p><p>That happens naturally to many people at a young age, and the important thing is not to get used to it.</p><p>I can’t count how much time I wasted procrastinating in my early career.</p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Understand how procrastination works; as they say, know your enemy. Today there’s a lot of literature you can easily access.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Use SMART goals to define what I wanted to achieve.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Use my calendar to time-box my day and make sure to spend at least half of it focused on my goals.</em></p></li></ul><p>I was always a very competitive person, and especially at the beginning of my career in engineering, this gave me some headaches. I remember I was very frustrated when I saw people who were better than me at doing something related to my job. </p><p>While this pushed me to do better on one side, on the other hand, it also caused a lot of unnecessary stress and sometimes even friction with these people.</p><p>Today, I tend to avoid competition in favor of collaboration, and this is what I also teach my teams.</p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Focus more on taking others as examples and not as challenges.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Collaborate more with others instead of competing with them.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Always surround yourself with people who know more than you do.</em></p></li></ul><p><span>I&#39;ve already written a lot about </span><a href="https://hybridhacker.email/p/journaling-for-engineering-management" rel="">journaling</a><span>, and it’s something today I couldn’t live without. </span></p><p>But early in my career, I was one of those who were just head-down into their job, confident of remembering everything and convinced that writing was useless. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

every habit, it’s much harder to get used to it in adult age.</p></li><li><p>You lose years of history that could be useful for future reflections.</p></li></ul><p>I understood the power of these habits just in recent years, and it took a lot of effort to establish them.</p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Learn more about note-taking and go beyond what I learned about this topic at school, where they rarely teach it to you the right way.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Start a journal and keep track of my thoughts, projects, everything.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Choose one tool and stick to it (I can’t count how many note-taking apps I&#39;ve changed).</em></p></li></ul><p>School and learning are interesting chapters of my life.</p><p>I’m curious by nature, and my curiosity pushed me to explore many different fields, not always related to the engineering career path. </p><p>While I don’t regret this trait of mine, which made me the generalist I’m today, if I were to go back, I’d probably try to channel my curiosity into a more focused trajectory.</p><p>I always had a difficult relationship with school.</p><p>I never repeated a year in high school, but it was a struggle to finish, and then I started university mostly because my parents wanted me to. I changed universities four times, took about 20 exams in total, and continued to pay the annual university fees for several years before finally quitting.</p><p>All this while I was already working as a systems engineer for major Italian telecommunication companies.</p><p>Even though nothing I learned at university was directly useful for my career, I was afraid to quit due to pressure from my parents and the fact that my friends were almost all graduating. </p><p>This isn&#39;t to say that school or university isn&#39;t important, but especially today, when you can learn almost anything online, traditional education isn&#39;t the only option for pursuing a career in IT engineering.</p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Focus more on my own future rather than on what others think.</p></li><li><p>Choose a clear direction—whether that be pursuing education or committing to a full-time job. Although it’s possible to do both, focusing on one at a time is much simpler and often more effective.</p></li></ul><p>I’m a very practical person who loves to learn through experimentation and failure. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with this approach, it was the reason I never developed a strong and consistent reading habit.</p><p>Until my 30s, I believed that reading about the experiences of others was unnecessary, and that the only true way to learn was through firsthand experience. Only in recent years have I begun to read and realized how wrong I was.</p><p>Reading is not only a great way to learn new things, but it also helps you to develop critical thinking skills.</p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Force myself to read books until I developed a habit.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Choose books that delve into the stories and thoughts of others, as well as behavioral books, rather than focusing only on technical ones.</em></p></li></ul><p><span>I </span><a href="https://hybridhacker.email/p/from-individual-contributor-to-director" rel="">previously wrote</a><span> about my career journey and how I landed in my current role at Namecheap. A</span></p><p>lthough my path over the last 10-15 years has been relatively consistent, I spent the first decade of my career with no clear idea of what to do.</p><p>This is probably one of the things I’d try to change if I could go back.</p><p>While in the early years of everyone’s career, it’s probably normal not to have a clear idea of where you want to end up, having nothing at all made me waste a lot of time. </p><p>Before sitting down and defining my career path, which brought me to where I am today, I went through system engineering, security, product management, design, freelancing, and entrepreneurship. </p><p>While all these switches made me acquire a lot of different skills, if I could go back, I’d probably follow a more structured and deliberate approach.</p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Set clear short-term and long-term career goals.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Regularly evaluate my progress and adjust my career path as needed.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Seek advice from experienced professionals to help clarify my direction.</em></p></li></ul><p>I had my first computer (a C64) when I was 13, but at least in the first part of my career, I often saw coding as something too hard for me, and this made me focus mostly on the system engineering side. </p><p>Only in recent years have I started coding more seriously and understood that it’s complementary to systems engineering, so worth learning, even if you don’t want to follow the developer’s path.</p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Dedicate specific time to coding to strengthen my skills.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Participate in coding challenges and open-source projects.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Collaborate with software developers to gain insights and practical knowledge.</em></p></li></ul><p>If you want to advance in your career, leaving your comfort zone is mandatory, and this often means becoming publicly exposed.</p><p>It could be within your team, your company, or a wider community, but exposing your thoughts and ideas and being ready to be judged in public is an incredible booster.</p><p>I’m an introvert, and I&#39;ve always disliked being on stage. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

However, I&#39;ve learned the hard way that this approach is unsustainable in the long run and establishes a wrong habit that it’s hard to eradicate when you are older.</p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Enforce strict boundaries between work and personal life.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Learn to decline tasks that could put these boundaries at risk.</em></p></li></ul><p>I always loved doing sports and I dedicated a lot of time to them during the early stages of my career, but then, after going all-in with my career, I stopped. </p><p>Today I find myself still struggling in building a consistent workout habit</p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Make physical activity something mandatory into my daily schedule.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Choose enjoyable and sustainable forms of exercise to ensure regularity.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Set and monitor fitness goals.</em></p></li></ul><p>For the same reasons I often struggled with public exposure early in my career, networking and relying on others&#39; mentorship were also challenges.</p><p>Even though I participated in many events and met numerous people in my field, I believe I could have done much better, especially in terms of maintaining these relationships. </p><p>As I have previously written, I enjoy learning through my own failures and consider it a valuable learning method. However, similar to my experiences with reading books, I now realized how beneficial it can be to have a mentor or rely on coaches, especially early in your career.</p><p>It&#39;s not about having someone to tell you what to do; it’s about gaining different perspectives and comparing your approaches with those used by other successful people. This not only saves time but also significantly boosts your personal growth.</p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Find a mentor who could have guided me through my journey.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Invest on coaching during complex situations or critical career transitions.</em></p></li></ul><p>Building a broad network can open doors to countless opportunities and insights. </p><p>I often underestimated the power of networking in unlocking potential career paths and collaborations. </p><p>What I particularly lacked was consistency and growing relationships. </p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Attend more events and be less scared of approaching people.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Curate my relationships over time.</em></p></li></ul><p>I believe that looking back at your career is always a useful exercise, as it was for me while writing this article. </p><p><span>The most important thing is to do this </span><strong>without feeling frustrated</strong><span> about what you could have done better, and instead focus on how you can improve things going forward.</span></p><p>To sum up what I would do better if I were to start my engineering career today:</p><ul><li><p><span>🕒 </span><strong>Procrastination Management</strong><span>: understand procrastination better, use SMART goals, and time-box my days to focus on specific goals.</span></p></li><li><p><span>🤝 </span><strong>Avoid Competition</strong><span>: emphasize collaboration over competition, take examples from others constructively, and surround myself with more knowledgeable people.</span></p></li><li><p><span>📓 </span><strong>Journaling and Note-Taking</strong><span>: start journaling early in my career and learn effective note-taking, using one consistent tool.</span></p></li><li><p><span>🎓 </span><strong>Education Choices</strong><span>: focus more on my own goals instead of others’ expectations, and choose a clear educational or career path.</span></p></li><li><p><span>📚 </span><strong>Reading Habits</strong><span>: force myself to develop a reading habit early, focusing on diverse books.</span></p></li><li><p><span>🧭 </span><strong>Career Path Definition</strong><span>: set clear career goals, regularly evaluate progress, and seek guidance from experienced professionals.</span></p></li><li><p><span>💻 </span><strong>Coding Practice</strong><span>: allocate specific times for coding, participate in coding challenges, and collaborate with developers.</span></p></li><li><p><span>🗣️ </span><strong>Public Speaking</strong><span>: join a theater club or get coaching, volunteer for speaking opportunities, and practice regularly.</span></p></li><li><p><span>✍️ </span><strong>Writing Publicly</strong><span>: start and maintain a blog or newsletter in the early stages of my career, and write consistently about it.</span></p></li><li><p><span>⚖️ </span><strong>Work-Life Balance</strong><span>: set firm boundaries between work and personal life, and learn to decline tasks that put these boundaries at risk.</span></p></li><li><p><span>🏋️ </span><strong>Physical Fitness</strong><span>: integrate physical activity into my daily schedule, choose the right activities, and set fitness goals.</span></p></li><li><p><span>🌐 </span><strong>Mentorship and Networking</strong><span>: seek mentors and coaches early in my career, network actively, and nurture professional relationships consistently.</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href="https://thepeoplessoftwareengineer.substack.com/p/preparing-for-behavioral-interviews?r=1to968" rel="">Preparing for behavioral interviews</a><span> by </span></p><span> </span></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/how-to-recognize-the-potential-in?r=1to968" rel="">How to recognize the potential in engineers</a><span> by </span></p><span> </span></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.techleadmentor.com/p/5-mistakes-that-new-tech-leads-make?r=1to968" rel="">5 Mistakes that New Tech Leads Make</a><span> by </span></p><span> </span></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/high-performers-share-their-point-of-view?r=1to968" rel="">How to share your point of view</a><span> by </span></p><span> </span></li><li><p><a href="https://makemeacto.substack.com/p/90-days-in-key-lessons-from-my-solopreneur?r=1to968" rel="">90 Days In: Key Lessons from My Solopreneur Journey</a><span> by </span></p><span> </span></li></ul><p><span>That&#39;s all for today!
