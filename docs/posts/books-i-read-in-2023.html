<p>A few years ago I read the <a href="https://blog.jonnew.com/posts/books-i-read-2020">first Mistborn trilogy</a> per my nieces’ recommendations. I finally got around to reading the follow up trilogy which consists of The Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, and the Bands of Mourning. It takes place centuries after the original trilogy, in a pseudo-western/industrial age. Most of the main characters from the original Mistborn trilogy are part of world’s religion or lore. It’s been pretty fun to see how allomancy and feruchemy and other fantasy bits get put to use in this universe. Fun characters, easy read, and again, some solid surprises. A worthwhile follow up!</p>

<h4 id="bossypants-by-tina-fey"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011MEKLXS/"><img src="https://blog.jonnew.com/assets/books-2023/bossypants.jpg" alt="Bossypants"/></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011MEKLXS/">Bossypants</a> by Tina Fey</h4>
<p>Tina Fey really cracks me up. I enjoyed her work on 30 Rock and SNL and her autobiography doesn’t disappoint. In addition to the jokes, it provides interesting background into other notable parts of her life, like joining SNL and impersonating Sarah Palin. The book is a little dated at this point, just over 10 years old, but I still really enjoyed it.</p>

<h4 id="payments-systems-in-the-us-by-carol-coye-benson-scott-loftesness-russ-jones"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982789742/"><img src="https://blog.jonnew.com/assets/books-2023/paymentsSystemsUS.jpg" alt="Payments Systems in the US"/></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982789742/">Payments Systems in the US</a> by Carol Coye Benson, Scott Loftesness, Russ Jones</h4>
<p>Last year I read <a href="https://blog.jonnew.com/posts/books-i-read-2022">Anatomy of the Swipe</a>, and I found it rather lacking. However, Payments Systems in the US manages to provide a lot more detail and breadth into more payments systems, including their history, and how recent legislation affects the various payment methods. This was really well written, and a good primer for anyone diving into the financial industry.</p>

<h4 id="open-an-autobiography-by-andre-agassi"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307388409/"><img src="https://blog.jonnew.com/assets/books-2023/open.jpg" alt="Open: An Autobiography"/></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307388409/">Open: An Autobiography</a> by Andre Agassi</h4>
<p>This was probably one of the most compelling biographies I have ever read. Agassi chronicles his difficult and bizarre childhood, as well as his Grand Slam triumphs, and relationships. This is another slightly dated autobiography (around 10 years old), but it’s an entertaining glimpse into the life of one of the last great American tennis champions.</p>

<h4 id="what-we-owe-the-future-by-william-macaskill"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N3D7QSQ"><img src="https://blog.jonnew.com/assets/books-2023/whatWeOweTheFuture.jpg" alt="What We Owe the Future"/></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N3D7QSQ">What We Owe the Future</a> by William MacAskill</h4>
<p>I was excited about this book, but unfortunately, <a href="https://twitter.com/jpalardy/status/1608260925559308288?s=20">as my friend Jonathan warned me, it falls a little flat</a>. There’s a few interesting tidbits, but overall it feels too big for the point it tries to make. I did enjoy the end where it discusses how to make the biggest impacts in our life.</p>

<h4 id="paved-paradise-by-henry-grabar"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9657N8R"><img src="https://blog.jonnew.com/assets/books-2023/pavedParadise.jpg" alt="Paved Paradise"/></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9657N8R">Paved Paradise</a> by Henry Grabar</h4>
<p>Last year I read <a href="https://blog.jonnew.com/posts/books-i-read-2022">Walkable City</a>, and I’ve continued on my urbanism journey with Paved Paradise. I think this is actually a pretty important book. If you look around your city and wonder why land and buildings are underutilized, it’s likely because of minimum parking requirements. <em>Paved Paradise</em> catalogs several interesting stories about the grift that happens in parking structures, how Chicago foolishly sold all parking revenues for a fraction of their value, and how parking minimums have made it impossible to build even the most modest structures. There’s plenty of discussion about how Donald Shoup and groups like the <a href="https://parkingreform.org/">Parking Reform Network</a> are pushing back. For a book about parking, it’s a gripping read.</p>
