    <h1>Google Console closed testing requirements are awful</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have been coding for 2-3 years and decided to make my first mobile app, just something small and simple to get a feel for it.</p><p>I wanted to publish it to the play store, get exposure and share what I have made. I paid the $25 fee, submitted my passport and bank statements for ID verification, and started the process to get my app published.</p><p>Well, what a terrible experience. It is not user friendly at all, and the requirement of 20 testers opting in to your closed testing for 14 days makes very little sense. I have spent the last few days messaging people, doing the test swaps, and generally wasting my time.</p><p>I have seen, from searching to find places that I can recruit testers, a number of &#39;services&#39; where you can simply pay to have your app &#39;tested&#39;. The whole thing has been really off-putting, what is the point..?</p><p>I wanted to make a flutter app next, something more detailed and complex.. but I am dreading having to go through this process of &#39;closed testing&#39;, after spending months making a project, essentially spamming forums and chat groups for testers. I paid for access to the store, I submitted my ID documents, this arbitrary barrier is so frustrating and again, really puts me off making a mobile app..</p><p>I know I am shouting into the void here, I suppose I just wanted to vent.</p></div></div></div>
