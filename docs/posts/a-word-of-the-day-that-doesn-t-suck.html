    <h1>Show HN: A word of the day that doesn&#39;t suck</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>I’ve long thought that the Word of the Day was a wasted genre. The goal should be to give you words you can use; to enrich your understanding of words you already know; or at least to use words to tell you something neat about the world.</p><p>Instead, what you usually get is words that will never be used in conversation, held up as curios. Some examples from Dictionary.com’s daily email: thewless, balladmonger, vagility, contextomy. These words are... not useful.</p><p>I’ve always thought I could do better. My friend Ben recently created a daily puzzle game, called Bracket City, launched here on HN [1], which I like because it takes about the same amount of time as Wordle but has some of the variety and artistry of a good crossword.</p><p>Ben agreed to let me write a word of the day for the game’s audience. We’ve collected them all here: <a href="https://bracket.city/words" rel="nofollow">https://bracket.city/words</a>. It’s such a joy to write -- every day, I pay homage to a word I love or use or have newly discovered. I find myself paying more attention to words I encounter, thinking if they deserve a place.</p><p>It’s also fun for another reason. Many years ago I wrote a blog post, &#34;You’re probably using the wrong dictionary&#34; [2], that made the rounds and actually still finds new readers today. It was about how the modern-day dictionaries we find by default on our iPhones and web browsers are actually kind of bureaucratic and lifeless. Through a writer I love, John McPhee, I rediscovered Webster’s 1913 dictionary, which feels like it was written by a thinking person who loved words. I still consult it all the time. Writing a word of the day has reminded me just how delightful and useful Webster’s old dictionary is -- and reacquainted me with the OED, which I now look to every day, and which I discovered you can access with your library card.</p><p>Some of my favorite entries so far: sophisticated, twee, gravitas, blockbuster, meteorologist, send, bid. There are more than 175 now -- and more coming once a day, every day, for as long as Bracket City stands.</p><p>To sign up to see each word of the day as it’s published, go to <a href="https://bracket.city/words" rel="nofollow">https://bracket.city/words</a>.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43622719">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43622719</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary" rel="nofollow">https://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary</a></p></div></td></div></div>
