<h2>Abstract</h2><p>
  seL4 is the world&#39;s most secure operating system (OS) kernel, but
  it is a far cry from being an OS. As a microkernel, it provides core
  mechanisms for securely multiplexing the hardware, but none of the
  services application programmers expect, so adopters are forced to
  develop those themselves. Furthermore, a high level of expertise is
  required to design performant systems on top of seL4. The result is
  frequently a poor design, and far too often people giving up.
</p>

<p>
  The Trustworthy Systems team at UNSW has now decided to build Lions
  OS, a complete seL4-based OS aimed to support the needs of
  developers of cyberphysical, IoT and other embedded systems. Lions
  OS, named after John Lions (of Lions Book fame, arguably one of the
  fathers of open source), is being designed and implemented from
  scratch, with the seemingly conflicting goals of high performance,
  high security and adaptability to a wide class of use
  cases. Specifically we plan to prove the correct implementation of
  its critical components.
</p>

<p>
  In the talk I explain why I think this is not only achievable, but
  will be achieved within 2-3 years, by strictly adhering to the
  time-honoured engineering principle KISS – keep it simple, stupid! I
  will present our initial results that show that, with the right
  design, this simplicity can not only achieve excellent performance
  (outperforming Linux networking) but also enable proofs of
  implementation correctness. The talk serves as the public launch of
  Lions OS -- needless to say, it&#39;s open source.
