<p>It’s Monday morning and I’ve published my 3rd YouTube video!!!</p>



<p>I’m feeling pretty good about it!!!</p>



<p>Among other things, this has been a bit of a personal experiment where I try maintaining an ongoing creative project (ongoing as opposed to a 1-off weekend thing) while also still working a full-time job, studying Korean, getting exercise, <strong>and</strong> having time for relaxation, friend time, and partner time. I’ve never been able to do it; the balancing act would always <a href="https://www.vrk.dev/2022/09/27/i-made-a-youtube-channel-the-b-side-announcement/">collapse</a> on me. </p>



<p>So even to make it to video #3 – just feels great to have done! 🙌</p>



<p>And by this 3rd video I have SO many learnings – with video creating specifically and creative projects in general 💖</p>



<h2>📼 The video</h2>



<p>Here is the video!! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvkSqc-zL1U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvkSqc-zL1U</a></p>

<h2>📹 The process</h2>



<p>It’s 50 days since my last YouTube video was uploaded, and in those 50 days I created …3 videos on 3 totally separate topics 😂 only one of which I saw through the finish and uploaded, which is the video above!</p>



<p>BUT I feel like I made a huge breakthrough in my video creation process in this time!</p>



<p>1️⃣ <strong>For video attempt 1 (Nov 23 – Dec 5):</strong> I wanted to try to create an “easier” video, which was going to be an overview of my (real) complicated Korean study routine.</p>



<p>…I probably should have figured that, making a video that is explaining something complicated, IS NOT going to be an easy video to write, record or edit lol. But I had to learn the hard way!</p>



<p>I wrote the script, I recorded the whole thing over a few days, I began editing, and…. I just ran out of steam.</p>



<p>I felt overwhelmed by how much content was left to edit, and how much work was left to do. The video just felt really difficult and massive.</p>



<p>💤 <strong>Dec 6 – Dec 24:</strong> During this time I did NOTHING with YouTube at all. For about half of this time I was sick from a bad cold, and about half of this time I was just… not feeling it! And not sure what to do.</p>



<p>⭐️<strong> I then had a realization:</strong> I needed to make some changes so that this YouTube hobby could be sustainable. This was taking too much energy for me to keep up. Usually this is exactly when I would just give up project altogether, with the seemingly good reason of “I don’t have the time or energy for this” – but this time I challenged myself to figure out if there was another video format that could be easier, less time-consuming, and less energy-intensive for me to complete.</p>



<p>2️⃣ <strong>For video attempt 2 (Dec 25): </strong>Davis got me a ring light and tripod as part of my Christmas gift, so inspired by that, I thought, “hmm what if I create a totally different style of video?”</p>



<p>I tried recording a video on how to set up a new journal for the new year. Journaling is also something I love, something I got a lot better at in the last couple of years, and I’d love to share what I’ve learned about it. It’s similar to how I feel about Korean!</p>



<p>But <em>ahhh</em> this was more difficult to make than even my previous videos!!</p>



<p>I recorded myself making some journaling layouts, but then at the end of it, I just had all of this footage of me journaling and…  no idea how to shape it into a video.</p>



<p>Plus, recording my journal layouts made me feel a bit self-conscious, like “gah are these layouts even worth sharing? Am I good enough yet at journaling to make videos about them?”</p>



<p>From a pure pragmatic standpoint, I was like hmm, I think I’ll need some personal growth before I can comfortably post videos on how I journal, soooo proooobably not the right path to go down if I’m trying to make videos <em>less</em> energy-intensive 😭/😂</p>



<p>⭐️ So <em>then</em> I had to consider again <strong>– what might make YouTube videos easier for me? </strong></p>



<p>I realized that I am actually really confident in my study skills (lol) as opposed to my journaling aesthetics, and I really enjoy teaching, so it’s probably still a good direction to try to stay in the “how to study” realm for a bit.</p>



<p>I thought back to how I would prepare lessons and talks when they <em>aren’t</em> a YouTube video – and I realized that when it came to talks, my home base was always <strong>the slide deck</strong>.</p>



<p>If I can say so myself, I think I am really good at <a href="https://arc.net/e/48E52B66-308F-4DE8-9946-D2BFECD4972F">making slide decks</a> 😂 I love planning out the visual story even more than giving the presentation; for me it’s the visual story first, the “talk” part second. </p>



<p>I decided to try an experiment: <strong>What if I created the graphics for my video <em>first</em></strong>, alongside writing the script, before recording or editing? I’ve literally never heard anyone suggest doing this but I wanted to give it a try.</p>



<p><strong>The result: OMG!!!!!!!</strong> <em>soooooooo</em> much better!!!! It is <em>wild</em> how much of a difference this made. </p>



<p>In retrospect, “creating the graphics” is not just creating graphics for me, but it’s actually my way of drafting a narrative and doing mental storyboarding for the story I want to tell. It was just so grounding and it was <em>so </em>much easier for me to visualize what the video would look like and to get a sense of pacing and structure.</p>



<p>It also felt a lot less overwhelming!! I think my previous process put so much work <em>after</em> recording, where it’s harder to make changes, whereas this new process puts more of the work <em>before</em> recording, so editing was much more straightforward.</p>



<p>My old process was something like this this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Create a script &lt;– this is where I would try to figure out the structure of the video, but usually couldn’t quite get it right</li>



<li>Record myself speaking the script</li>



<li><em>Actually</em> figure out what the structure of the video is, while editing the script, creating graphics, and rerecording parts that don’t work 🫠</li>
</ol>



<p>And now the process was:</p>



<ol>
<li>Create script and graphics &lt;– this is where I figure out the structure of the video, using graphics as my anchoring points!</li>



<li>Record myself with the script and graphics in mind</li>



<li>Edit the videos to fit the graphics and structure</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>3️⃣ Video 3 (Dec 28 – Jan 9): I COMPLETED THIS VIDEO IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS!!</strong> I didn’t even work on it every day – I had probably 3 long days of work <em>(long: 3-6hr sessions)</em> but in total I went from concept to published YouTube video in under 2 weeks.</p>



<p>As a point of reference, my last video took me 7 weeks and 3 full recordings of the same topic before I finished the video — so this is huge improvement!!!</p>



<p>📼 <strong>And the video itself: </strong>It’s pretty good!! I can see myself improving on things like delivery and pacing! Still not a perfect video, but definitely feel like I am progressing!</p>



<h2>💞 Reflections</h2>



<p>I’ve got to wrap up this post and start work, but wanted to write down a few reflections as I have them:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>A useful prompt: </strong>It’s a little cheesy but something that has been helping me is the prompt, “What happens if I don’t give up? What happens if I just keep trying?” I think this prompt speaks to me because I really don’t know if I will be “successful” if I keep at this, and I don’t want to put that pressure on myself either. But I am genuinely curious <em>what happens</em>, because I haven’t done this before. Having some moments of progress in this YouTube journey, in between the rough moments, has been personally really exciting and encouraging!</li>



<li><strong>Advice I found helpful when framed differently: </strong>Something super interesting is that I strongly reject the advice, “just post a video every week” – but got a lot of value from, “I need to make this sustainable.” And in practice, ‘sustainable’ meant, having the ability to create a video that I feel proud of, under 2 weeks, without straining myself. Still processing this a bit but it felt like an interesting reframe!</li>



<li><strong>LOL very specific reflection: </strong>I find it so hard to make thumbnails 😭</li>



<li><strong>The pull of metrics optimization</strong> – “more views!! more subscribers!!” is something that’s more <em>present</em> than I thought it would be, but luckily I haven’t felt very distracted by it! I think it’s because I’ve had occasions in the past where random internet things of mine have gotten suddenly, unexpectedly popular and it stressed me out a lot. I like the idea of practicing the craft of creating videos, while not having the pressure of an audience ✨ I do think at some point I’m going to want more people to see what I’m creating, but for now I love the idea of just creating quietly and improving my ability to go from concept to published video!</li>



<li><strong>Rewards?</strong> As a way to motivate myself to <em>create the content</em> and not just <em>buy the stuff</em> <em>to create the content</em>, I decided I would buy myself a new fancy mic as a present to myself after video #3. I’m very glad I waited, because now that video 3 is here, I … actually don’t think I want a mic! There is soooo much to learn with creating videos, and to me, adding a new fancy mic right now would just be another thing to learn, which in itself was an interesting learning for me! The benefit of a low-tech setup is it’s simple and less overhead for learning, which is great if I’m trying to reduce the friction to producing videos. …BUT I do want to reward myself for video 3! What should the reward be…?</li>
</ul>
