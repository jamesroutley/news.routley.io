  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When I saw the following equation in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10348.pdf">attribution patching paper</a>, I got really confused and spent a bunch of time thinking about it:</p><p>

\[L(x_\text{clean} | \operatorname{do}{(E = e_\text{corr})}) \approx L(x_\text{clean}) + (e_\text{corr} - e_\text{clean})^\top \frac{\partial}{\partial e_\text{clean}} L(x_\text{clean}| \operatorname{do}{(E = e_\text{clean})})\]

</p><p>Eventually, I realized that my confusion boiled down to the fact that I didn’t really have any experience with the multivariate Taylor series, but it is actually not necessary.</p>

<p>I present another simple way to derive the above formula without really doing the Taylor series (it is exactly equivalent though):</p><p>

\[\frac{\partial L}{\partial e_\text{clean}} \approx \frac{\Delta L}{\Delta e} = \frac{L_\text{corr} - L_\text{clean}}{e_\text{corr} - e_\text{clean}}.\]

</p><p>Solving for \(\Delta L\), we get</p><p>

\[\Delta L = \frac{\partial L}{\partial e_\text{clean}} * (e_\text{corr} - e_\text{clean})\]

</p><p>by multiplying the \(e_\text{corr} - e_\text{clean}\) over.</p>

<p>This gives \(\Delta L\) with shape of the activations, with the biggest components  having the biggest sway in the circuit. To turn it back into a scalar for the metric, we can just reduce sum over it, or equivalently compute it using the dot product instead of elementwise product, which is what the paper did.</p>

<p>I hope that this post illuminated the method better, especially if you don’t have a math background.</p>
