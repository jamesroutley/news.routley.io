    <h1>Suchir Balaji Case Reopened: From ‘Suicide&#39; to &#39;Active Investigation’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="descwithads"><p>The death of Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old former OpenAI researcher, is now being treated as an ‘active and open investigation’ by the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, a month after he publicly criticized OpenAI’s practices in an interview with The New York Times. Initial reports ruled the death a suicide, but new developments have cast doubt on this conclusion.</p><div> <div><div></div></div> </div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2>Suchir Balaji Case: Suicide To Suspicion</h2><!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><div> <div><div></div></div> </div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2>Suchir Balaji Case: Mother&#39;s Claims</h2><!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><div><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2></h2><!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </div><div> <div><div></div></div> </div><p>The case has drawn a lot of attention and some prominent voices, including that of <a href="https://www.republicbiz.com/topics/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> , who doubted the suicide ruling as an initial determination.
