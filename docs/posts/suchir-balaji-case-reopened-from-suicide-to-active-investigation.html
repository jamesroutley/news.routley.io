Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, a month after he publicly criticized OpenAI’s practices in an interview with The New York Times. Initial reports ruled the death a suicide, but new developments have cast doubt on this conclusion.</p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2>Suchir Balaji Case: Suicide To Suspicion</h2><!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2>Suchir Balaji Case: Mother&#39;s Claims</h2><!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p>The case has drawn a lot of attention and some prominent voices, including that of <a href="https://www.republicbiz.com/topics/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> , who doubted the suicide ruling as an initial determination. There are growing speculations about whether his whistleblowing against OpenAI company for unethical data practices and copyright infringement might have made him a target.</p><p>The alleged killing of Balaji raises concerns about the risks and threats that whistleblowers within the tech industry face, especially when questioning powerful organizations of AI. When the public interest becomes intense, the expanding investigation might unveil systemic issues-both within AI bodies and local law enforcement.</p><p>The case now unfolding is becoming the focus of most talks on ethics, accountability, and safety within the fast-evolving artificial intelligence world.</p></div> </div> <p>Updated 19:02 IST, January 15th 2025</p>     </div></div>    </div></div>
