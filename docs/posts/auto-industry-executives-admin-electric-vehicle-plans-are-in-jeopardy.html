GM has been an early-mover in the electric car market, selling the Chevrolet Bolt for seven years and making bold claims about a fully electric future for the company long before its competitors got on board.</p><p>But this week on GM&#39;s third-quarter earnings call, Barra and GM struck a more sober tone. The company announced with its quarterly results that it&#39;s abandoning its targets to build 100,000 EVs in the second half of this year and another 400,000 by the first six months of 2024. GM doesn&#39;t know when it will hit those targets.</p><p>&#34;As we get further into the transformation to EV, it&#39;s a bit bumpy,&#34; she said.</p><p>While GM&#39;s about-face was somewhat of a surprise to investors, the Detroit car company is not alone in this new view of the EV future. Even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-elon-musk-economy-credit-card-debt-real-estate-war-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>Tesla&#39;s Elon Musk warned</u></a> on a recent earnings call that economic concerns would lead to waning vehicle demand, even for the long-time EV market leader.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz — which is having to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-vehicles-selling-for-for-less-than-sticker-price-deals-2023-10#mercedes-benz-eqb-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>discount its EVs by several thousand dollars</u></a> just to get them in customers&#39; hands — isn&#39;t mincing words about the state of the EV market.</p><p>&#34;This is a pretty brutal space,&#34; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/mercedes-benz-expects-hit-lower-end-returns-forecast-cars-division-2023-10-26/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">CFO Harald Wilhelm said on an analyst call</a>. &#34;I can hardly imagine the current status quo is fully sustainable for everybody.&#34;</p><h2>EVs are getting harder to sell</h2><p>But Mercedes isn&#39;t the only one; almost all current EV product is going for under sticker price these days, and on top of that, some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-vehicle-incentives-at-dealerships-high-affordability-price-parity-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>EVs are seeing manufacturer&#39;s incentives of nearly 10%</u></a>.</p><p>That&#39;s as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-vehicle-inventory-most-least-dealerships-availability-hyundai-kia-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>inventory builds up at dealerships</u></a>, much to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dealers-turning-away-evs-velectric-cars-demand-cools-inventory-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>chagrin of dealers</u></a>. While <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/auto-dealerships-inventory-electric-vehicles-gas-cars-key-problems-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>car buyers are in luck</u></a> if they&#39;re looking for a deal on a plug-in vehicle, executives are finding even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-vehicle-discounts-price-cuts-affordable-tesla-competitor-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>significant markdowns and discounts</u></a> aren&#39;t enough. These <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ev-sales-getting-tougher-car-dealers-say-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>cars are taking dealers longer to sell</u></a> compared with their gas counterparts as the next wave of buyers focus on cost, infrastructure challenges, and lifestyle barriers to adopting.</p><p>Just a few months after dealers started coming forward to warn of slowing EV demand, manufacturers appear to be catching up to that reality. Ford was the first to fold, after <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-electric-vehicle-inventory-problem-trying-to-beat-tesla-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>dealers started turning away Mach-E allocations</u></a>. In July, the company extended its self-imposed deadline to hit annual electric vehicle production of 600,000 by a year, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-ev-production-slow-thanks-to-tesla-price-war-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>abandoned a 2026 target to build 2 million EVs</u></a>.</p><p>In scrapping plans with GM to co-develop sub-$30,000 EVs, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-25/honda-ceo-says-scrapping-plans-with-gm-to-develop-smaller-evs?embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=LspfQlRv" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said the shifting EV environment was difficult to gauge.</a></p><p>&#34;After studying this for a year, we decided that this would be difficult as a business, so at the moment we are ending development of an affordable EV,&#34; Mibe said in an interview with <u>Bloomberg</u> this week.</p><p>For some, this pullback is no surprise.</p><p>&#34;People are finally seeing reality,&#34; Toyota Motor Chairman Akio Toyoda said at the Japan Mobility Show, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/toyota-chairman-says-people-are-finally-seeing-the-reality-about-evs-31f1669c?mod=autos_news_article_pos1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"><u>Wall Street Journal</u></a> reported.
