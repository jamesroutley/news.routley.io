            <p>Three electricians were critically injured and transported to a local hospital after an &#34;electrical incident&#34; at a Google data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa, according to the Council Bluffs Police Department and Google.</p>
    
            <p>The incident occurred at 11:59 a.m. local time on Monday, the Council Bluffs Police Department told SFGATE. Three electricians were working on a substation close to the data center buildings when an arc flash (an electric explosion) occurred, causing significant burns to all three electricians.</p>
    <div id="paywall">
            <p>One person was taken by helicopter to Nebraska Medical Center, while two more were transported by ambulance. (Nebraska Medical Center is a short distance from Council Bluffs, which is right on the Iowa-Nebraska border.) All three people were conscious and breathing when they were transported for medical care, according to the Council Bluffs Police Department.</p>
