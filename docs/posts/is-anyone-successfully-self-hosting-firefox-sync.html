    <h1>Ask HN: Is anyone successfully self-hosting Firefox Sync?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I use Firefox as my primary browser, and I would absolutely love to be able to use the Firefox Sync functionality to sync bookmarks, etc. across several devices.</p><p>However, I do not want to risk storing absolutely sensitive data (browsing history, auth cookies, credentials, etc) at some third party.</p><p>Everytime this comes up in HN comments, someone says that Firefox Sync can be self-hosted. And while this was true in the older versions of Firefox, it seems to me that self-hosting is currently neither supported nor documented. And it has been like this for at least since 2020[1][2].
It seems self-hosting is not a priority for Mozilla.</p><p>Is anyone actually self-hosting Firefox Sync?
If so, how do you do it? 
How is it working for you?
Any issues to be aware of?</p><p>[1]: https://github.com/mozilla-services/syncstorage-rs/issues/681
