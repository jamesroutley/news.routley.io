    <h1>Ruffle: 2023 in Review</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It&#39;s been a very busy 2023 for Ruffle, so much so that we didn&#39;t find the time to write a new progress report with everything going on! Let&#39;s fix that!</p>
<p>Let&#39;s summarize with some numbers first.</p>
<p>Since the last blog post...</p>
<ul>
<li>ActionScript 3 Language has gone up from 60% to <strong>75%</strong>!</li>
<li>ActionScript 3 API has gone up from 60% to <strong>68%</strong>! (And it was only 25% at the start of the year!)</li>
<li>We&#39;ve merged <strong>852</strong> pull requests from <strong>43</strong> people! (And 3 bots.)</li>
<li>We&#39;ve closed <strong>1,288</strong> issues (and some of them weren&#39;t even duplicates or anything!)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="display-filters">Display Filters</h3>
<p>We&#39;ve now implemented 7 out of 10 of Flash&#39;s filter effects, making content look much more accurate (and lots of text actually legible!)</p>
<p>Along with filter support, we&#39;ve also implemented <code>cacheAsBitmap</code> support - a huge optimisation for games that use it, saving us the need to render the same thing every single frame!</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/issues/15">The remaining 3 filters</a> don&#39;t seem to be used often, but we welcome anyone who wishes to come help implement them! Support for the existing filters was done by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Dinnerbone">@Dinnerbone</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/torokati44">@torokati44</a>.</p>
<h3 id="text-improvements">Text improvements</h3>
<p>On the topic of rendering, we&#39;ve been picking and poking at fonts for a while now - and through our combined efforts we&#39;re finally starting to see the light at the end of this pixelated and wrongly shaped tunnel.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Lord-McSweeney">@Lord-McSweeney</a> has implemented basic Text Layout Framework (TLF) support, which has started to get some more advanced text rendering working.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kjarosh">@kjarosh</a> has also recently been working on making text inputs more functional, implementing text restrictions and better caret/selection rendering.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Dinnerbone">@Dinnerbone</a> has created the framework for loading device fonts, instead of using the default Noto Sans we use everywhere. It&#39;s available on web (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions-For-Users#how-do-i-change-the-fonts-used-by-flash-on-my-website">with some configuration</a>) but works out of the box on desktop thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/evilpie">@evilpie</a>!</p>
<p>With device font support landing, content that didn&#39;t embed their own font will now start looking much better. Notably, lots of Japanese content often relied on this, and didn&#39;t render text at all previously.</p>

<h3 id="sockets-even-on-the-web">Sockets... even on the web!</h3>
<p>This has definitely been one of the biggest hurdles to emulating Flash, but the incredible <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sleepycatcoding">@sleepycatcoding</a> came in and made it happen.</p>
<p>Any kind of multiplayer game such as Gaia, Habbo or Club Penguin relied on sockets (TCP sockets, or XML sockets) to function - and nobody was sure if we&#39;d manage to get these working on the web. Modern browsers just don&#39;t like that sort of thing!</p>
<p>On desktop it&#39;s now supported out of the box (but will prompt you for permission by default, just to be sure), but web needs <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions-For-Users#how-can-i-connect-to-a-tcpsocket-or-xmlsocket-from-the-web">a little configuration</a> to make it work.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://ruffle.rs/2024-01-14-2023-in-review/gaia.png"><img src="https://ruffle.rs/2024-01-14-2023-in-review/gaia.png" title="Gaia&#39;s Towns 2" alt="Gaia&#39;s Towns 2"/></a>

</video></p>
<h3 id="flash-remoting">Flash remoting</h3>
<p>In addition to sockets, another common way for online games to work was a protocol called &#34;Flash Remoting&#34;, using <code>NetConnection</code>.
This was most notably seen in any game that uses the Armor Games API, and we&#39;re happy to say that that now works more or less as expected!</p>
<h3 id="flv-and-video-playback">FLV and video playback</h3>
<p>This has been a tricky one, but <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kmeisthax">@kmeisthax</a> has been tackling this all year and making amazing progress. Ruffle now supports FLV playback, depending on which codec is required, and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielhjacobs">@danielhjacobs</a> has added a workaround for patented codecs on the web by playing them using the browser over the top of the content (or on desktop, just opening the browser).</p>
<p>There&#39;s still a lot of progress to be made here, and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/torokati44">@torokati44</a> has a working prototype of decoding H.264 using Cisco&#39;s OpenH264 which is very exciting!</p>
<h3 id="initial-air-support">Initial AIR support</h3>
<p>This was a long time stretch goal that&#39;s starting to see reality thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Aaron1011">@Aaron1011</a>! We now properly version the ActionScript 3 API, and this has been extended to allow AIR-only classes and methods.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have much to show for AIR stuff yet, but the framework to get us here has already helped close off many longstanding compatibility bugs when movies don&#39;t expect certain methods or properties to exist for the version of Flash they target.</p>
<h3 id="mixed-avm">Mixed AVM</h3>
<p>On the topic of longstanding bugs, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Lord-McSweeney">@Lord-McSweeney</a> has been working on allowing mixed-avm movies to run correctly - these are usually ActionScript 3 games running inside ActionScript 2 containers, or vice versa.</p>
<p>There&#39;s still more to do here, but it&#39;s already helped unblock lots of content from just mysteriously failing to start!</p>
<h3 id="extension-improvements">Extension improvements</h3>
<p>The extension now uses Manifest V3 (somewhat reluctantly), which enables us to... keep existing. Unfortunately this came with needing to remove the &#34;go to a swf url and play it in the browser&#34; feature, as that&#39;s no longer possible with MV3.</p>
<p>However, the upside to this is that we&#39;re now <a target="_blank" href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ruffle/pipjjbgofgieknlpefmcckdmgaaegban">in the Edge store</a>! Also, thanks to work from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kmeisthax">@kmeisthax</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielhjacobs">@danielhjacobs</a>, we&#39;re also now available on Firefox for Android! <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/android/addon/ruffle_rs">Check it out!</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WumboSpasm">@WumboSpasm</a> also redesigned the demo player in the extension, which <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielhjacobs">@danielhjacobs</a> made serve as the replacement for the aforementioned swf-url feature. It looks pretty neat!</p>
<h3 id="desktop-ui">Desktop UI</h3>
<p>Whilst we had a super basic UI introduced in our last blog post, now it&#39;s even better! It&#39;s still as simple to use as before, but the new Advanced Open menu has many new options you can toggle to change how content plays - plus we&#39;ve added a host of brand new debug tools that even Flash Player didn&#39;t have!</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://ruffle.rs/2024-01-14-2023-in-review/ui-open-advanced.png"><img src="https://ruffle.rs/2024-01-14-2023-in-review/ui-open-advanced.png" title="Ruffle&#39;s Open Advanced menu" alt="Ruffle&#39;s Open Advanced menu"/></a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://ruffle.rs/2024-01-14-2023-in-review/ui-debug.png"><img src="https://ruffle.rs/2024-01-14-2023-in-review/ui-debug.png" title="Ruffle&#39;s debug tools" alt="Ruffle&#39;s debug tools"/></a></p>
<h3 id="new-website">New website</h3>
<p>Whilst not Ruffle itself, the website got some much-needed love from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Dinnerbone">@Dinnerbone</a> with a total redesign. There&#39;s a lot more we&#39;d like to do in the future with it, but web development isn&#39;t the specialty of any of our regular contributors... help is very much welcome!</p>
<p>We&#39;ve also pulled in all the improvements to the Extension&#39;s demo player, and brought those over to the website too.</p>
<h3 id="too-many-contributions-to-call-out">Too many contributions to call out!</h3>
<p>There&#39;s been just so many PRs landing that not everything can take the spotlight here. We&#39;d like to thank every single person who helped shape Ruffle in 2023, and hope that 2024 brings more great progress.</p>
<p>In addition, a big thank you to our sponsors who help keep the project alive. We appreciate you all!</p>
