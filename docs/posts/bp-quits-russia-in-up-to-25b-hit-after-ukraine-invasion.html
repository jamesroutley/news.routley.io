It has caused us to fundamentally rethink bp&#39;s position with Rosneft,&#34; BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney said.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">The rapid retreat represents a dramatic exit for BP, the biggest foreign investor in Russia, and puts the spotlight on other Western companies with operations in the country including France&#39;s TotalEnergies <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TTEF.PA" target="_blank">(TTEF.PA)</a> and Britain&#39;s Shell <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/SHEL.L" target="_blank">(SHEL.L)</a>, amid an escalating crisis between the West and Moscow.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">It also underscores growing pressure from Western governments on their companies to curtail operations in Russia as they widen a net of economic sanctions against Moscow.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">British Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who on Friday had expressed &#34;concern&#34; over BP&#39;s Rosneft, welcomed the decision.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">&#34;Russia&#39;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine must be a wake up call for British businesses with commercial interests in (President Vladimir) Putin&#39;s Russia,&#34; Kwarteng said on Twitter.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Rosneft <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ROSN.MM" target="_blank">(ROSN.MM)</a> blamed BP&#39;s decision on &#34;unprecedented political pressure&#34;, Russian news agencies reported, saying 30 years of successful cooperation had been ruined. </p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Susannah Streeter, senior investment analyst at British retail stock broker Hargreaves Lansdown, said it will be &#34;highly difficult&#34; for BP &#34;to recover anywhere near what was considered to be the full value&#34; of Rosneft.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Last week, Looney said that BP was sticking to its Russian business and would comply with any Western sanctions on Moscow.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Earlier, Putin put Russia&#39;s nuclear deterrent on high alert in the face of Western reprisals for his invasion of Ukraine, which included blocking access to the SWIFT international payment system for some Russian banks.<a href="https://blog.zulip.com/world/india/war-with-ukraine-putin-puts-nuclear-deterrence-forces-alert-2022-02-27/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">And Norway&#39;s $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world&#39;s largest, will divest its Russian assets after the Ukraine invasion, its prime minister said.<a href="https://blog.zulip.com/world/europe/norway-says-its-sovereign-fund-will-divest-russia-2022-02-27/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">DIVIDEND BLOW</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">BP said its move and financial hit will not impact its short and long term financial targets within its strategy to shift away from oil and gas to low-carbon fuels and renewables energy.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">But Hargreaves Lansdown&#39;s Streeter said a write down of this magnitude is &#34;likely to limit the extent to which BP can continue to accelerate its transition towards renewables.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">Looney and his predecessor as CEO Bob Dudley will both step down from the board of Rosneft, which BP acquired a shareholding in as part of its $12.5 billion TNK-BP stake sale in 2013.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">BP held a board meeting on Friday and another on Sunday where the decision to quit Rosneft, as well as two other joint ventures BP has with Rosneft in Russia, was taken, a spokesperson for the company said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">It will take an $11 billion foreign exchange non-cash charge after the exit from Rosneft, which BP will no longer include in its accounts. BP said it also expects a second non-cash charge of up to $14 billion, for the &#34;carrying value&#34; of Rosneft.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">BP received revenue from Rosneft in the form of dividends which totalled around $640 million in 2021, roughly 3% of its overall cash flow from operations.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19">The company currently has around 200 employees in Russia, most of whom are local staff, the BP spokesperson said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-20">Many other Western energy companies have operations in Russia, including TotalEnergies which holds a 19.4% Novatek <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/NVTK.MM" target="_blank">(NVTK.MM)</a> stake and 20% of the Yamal LNG project.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-21">&#34;In the current environment any European or American company with assets in Russia must be considering similar moves,&#34; Eurasia Group analyst Henning Gloystein told Reuters.</p><figure data-testid="image-0"><div><div></div></div><figcaption>Reuters Graphics</figcaption></figure><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by Alexander Smith</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
