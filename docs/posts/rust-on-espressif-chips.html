    <h1>Rust on Espressif chips</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
	  <p>This is the next quarterly update of esp-rs effort, detailing the progress over Q2 2023.</p>
<h2 id="rust-compiler">Rust Compiler</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c6">ESP32-C6</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-h2">ESP32-H2</a> use the <code>riscv32imac</code> compilation target, however, for our standard library port based on esp-idf, only the <code>riscv32imc</code> existed. We now have support for the <code>riscv32imac</code> target #<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/111369">111369</a> meaning you can use the standard library port on the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c6">ESP32-C6</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-h2">ESP32-H2</a>. For those using the Xtensa enable compiler, the next release of the Rust compiler will also build and ship the <code>rust-analyzer-proc-macro-srv</code> component, which should fix many issues reported with rust analyzer #<a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/rust-build/pull/215">215</a>.</p>
<h2 id="esp-hal-no-std">esp-hal - no_std</h2>
<p>Most of the time spent this quarter has been on <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-h2">ESP32-H2</a> support. At the end of last quarter, we had some initial support but now we have managed to bring the ESP32-H2s level of support up to the level of our other chips in just a few months which is incredible. You can view the PRs for each driver <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+H2+is%3Aclosed+">here</a>.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve been working hard on adding support for async in esp-hal, this includes enabling async serial read <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/620">#620</a> and async serial write operations <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/510">#510</a>. Additionally, we added async support to the I2C driver <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/519">#519</a>. We also implemented support for multicore async GPIO <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/542">#542</a>. Moreover, we made the embassy time driver more flexible by allowing the choice of either timer on chips that support it <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/609">#609</a>.</p>
<p>We simplified the user-facing GPIO types, hiding the implementation details and only exposing the relevant information #<a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/553">553</a>, which then inspired a similar change in the DMA channel types, making them more user-friendly and intuitive to use <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/626">#626</a>. Additionally, we enabled SPI3 for DMA on ESP32-S3 <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/507">#507</a>. In order to provide support for specific boards with PSRAM built-in, we introduced initial PSRAM support for ESP32 <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/506">#506</a> and octal PSRAM support for ESP32-S3 <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/610">#610</a>.</p>
<p>Other noteworthy improvements include the integration of <code>esp-riscv-rt</code> into esp-hal <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/578">#578</a>. We also simplified the <code>Delay</code> driver and now derive <code>Clone</code> and <code>Copy</code> traits. We also move interrupt handling code to RAM for improved interrupt performance <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/568">#568</a> <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/541">#541</a>. Additionally, we addressed a bug related to setting the vector base for the second core on Xtensa-based CPUs <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/536">#536</a>.</p>
<h2 id="esp-wifi-no-std">esp-wifi - no_std</h2>
<p>We have removed the hard requirement for timg0 as the main timer, offering more configuration flexibility <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/199">#199</a>. Additionally, we reworked the initialization process to ensure proper initialization of both the hardware and scheduler <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/194">#194</a>. To enhance WiFi performance, we made <code>preempt</code> improvements, resulting in better overall performance and responsiveness <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/185">#185</a>. We also expanded the capabilities of the built-in stack by adding basic IPv6 support <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/181">#181</a>.</p>
<h2 id="esp-ieee802154-no-std">esp-ieee802154 - no_std</h2>
<p>The newly introduced ESP32-C6 &amp; ESP32-H2 include an 802.15.4 radio, which is a low-power, low-rate standard intended for embedded devices. The <code>esp-ieee802154</code> crate implements the low-level driver for the radio in both chips, entirely in Rust and completely open source! This is a big leap from our WiFi drivers, where we interface with binary blobs over the C FFI. There are some useful examples in the repository, including a <code>sniffer</code> example to receive raw 802.15.4 frames. In the next few months, we will begin working on getting this driver to work with <a href="https://openthread.io/"><code>openthread</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="esp-idf-std">esp-idf - std</h2>
<p>We added safe abstractions to the CRC functions in ESP ROM in <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/261">#261</a>. We also introduced support for <code>WakeupReason</code> from <code>Ext0</code> events, allowing for more fine-grained control over wakeup behavior <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/259">#259</a>. Additionally, we implemented I2S, enabling communication with I2S peripherals <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/232">#232</a>. Furthermore, we incorporated changes from the newest embedded-hal release into our drivers, ensuring compatibility and staying up-to-date with the latest improvements in the embedded-hal ecosystem <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/224">#224</a>.</p>
<p>In esp-idf-svc, we focused on expanding the capabilities of the server examples by adding higher-level server examples, providing more comprehensive and practical usage scenarios <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-svc/pull/269">#269</a>. We also exposed a simple safe wrapper for querying rssi when using WiFi <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-svc/pull/245">#245</a>. Additionally, we now support async and blocking adaptors for the WiFi driver <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-svc/pull/243">#243</a>. </p>

<h3 id="espflash">espflash</h3>
<p>The highlight of this cycle was the release of Version 2.0.0, which marked a major milestone for the project and introduced substantial enhancements <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/434">#434</a>. Please read the full <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a> before upgrading. </p>
<p>We also invested effort in refining the release and CI workflows, resulting in smoother and more efficient processes <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/421">#421</a> <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/419">#419</a>. We addressed specific issues such as missing imports for <code>linux</code> and <code>musl</code> environments <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/420">#420</a> and improved handling of serial ports on BSD systems <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/415">#415</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of usability and user experience, we eliminated the need for the <code>--partition-table</code> argument when erasing partitions, simplifying the process <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/413">#413</a>. We also updated to the latest version of <code>addr2line</code> and addressed breaking changes before releasing 2.0.0 <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/412">#412</a>. Furthermore, we improved error messaging by rewording the &#34;elf too big&#34; error and fixed the Windows installation process for smoother setup <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/400">#400</a> <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/399">#399</a>. Additionally, we introduced a diagnostic feature that informs users about the partition table format, aiding troubleshooting <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/397">#397</a>. To ensure compatibility and expand our supported targets, we updated the flasher stubs and bootloaders <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/426">#426</a> and the supported targets for ESP32-C6/H2 <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/424">#424</a>.</p>
<h3 id="probe-rs">probe-rs</h3>
<p>We&#39;ve had flashing support in probe-rs for a couple of years now, but it was only possible to flash a <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp32c3-direct-boot-example">direct-boot application</a>, but we now support the esp-idf bootloader format in probe-rs #<a href="https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/pull/1629">1629</a>. We also have improved the performance of using the built-in USB-SERIAL-JTAG peripheral available on many Espressif chips, resulting in up to a 10x improvement in flashing times and a better overall debugging experience #<a href="https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/pull/1633">1633</a>.</p>
<h2 id="matter-rs">matter-rs</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_(standard)">matter</a> is an open-source connectivity standard for smart home and Internet of things devices, that promises to make smart devices work with each other regardless of which company manufactures them. <a href="https://github.com/project-chip/matter-rs">matter-rs</a> is a pure Rust implementation of the matter protocol. <a href="https://github.com/kedars">@kedars</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ivmarkov">@ivmarkov</a> have been working hard to bring both <code>no_std</code> support and <code>async</code> support to <a href="https://github.com/project-chip/matter-rs">matter-rs</a>. For more information on the active development branches see <a href="https://github.com/project-chip/matter-rs#important-note">this section of the readme</a>.</p>
