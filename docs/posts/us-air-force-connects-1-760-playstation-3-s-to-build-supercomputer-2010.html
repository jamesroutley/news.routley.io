</div><p>(Phys.org)—About the 33rd largest supercomputer in the world right now is the US Air Force Research Laboratory&#39;s (AFRL) newest system, which has a core made of 1,760 Sony PlayStation 3 (PS3) consoles. In addition to its large capacity, the so-called &#34;Condor Cluster&#34; is capable of performing 500 trillion floating point operations per second (TFLOPS), making it the fastest interactive computer in the entire US Defense Department.

                                                                                    <p>The supercomputer, which is located in Rome, New York, was formally presented yesterday at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. It will be used by Air Force centers across the country for tasks such as radar enhancement, <a href="https://phys.org/tags/pattern+recognition/" rel="tag">pattern recognition</a>, satellite imagery processing, and artificial intelligence research. </p>
<p>Its speed allows it to analyze ultra-high-resolution images very quickly - at a rate of billions of pixels per minute - to greatly reduce the amount of time required. Due in part to the video game consoles&#39; cutting-edge <a href="https://phys.org/tags/graphics+capabilities/" rel="tag">graphics capabilities</a>, the supercomputer also has improved algorithms that can better identify blurred flying objects in space than previous computers could. </p>
<p>The Condor Cluster project began four years ago, when PlayStation consoles cost about $400 each. At the same time, comparable technology would have cost about $10,000 per unit. Overall, the PS3s for the supercomputer&#39;s core cost about $2 million. According to AFRL Director of High Power Computing Mark Barnell, that cost is about 5-10% of the cost of an equivalent system built with off-the-shelf computer parts.</p>
<p>Another advantage of the PS3-based supercomputer is its energy efficiency: it consumes just 10% of the power of comparable supercomputers. </p>
<p>In addition to the PS3s, the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/supercomputer/" rel="tag">supercomputer</a> also includes 168 separate graphical processing units and 84 coordinating servers to direct traffic within the system. The PS3s are the older, larger variety, since the newer slim models don&#39;t allow for the installation of Linux.
