We may think it’s great to put so much effort into ensuring the result is “perfect”, but at the end of the day, we never finish it and it becomes an endless “work in progress”, which is a big problem.</p><p><span>This article is done in collaboration with </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordancutler1/" rel="">Jordan Cutler</a><span>, Senior Software Engineer at Pinterest and the author of the newsletter </span><a href="https://read.highgrowthengineer.com/" rel="">High Growth Engineer</a><span>.</span></p><p>We both made a lot of mistakes thinking that perfecting is the way to go and after some time we realized that progress is so much better!</p><p>And today, we are sharing our stories with you! Let’s start with Jordan’s first.</p><p>Early in my career, I spent a lot of time writing code. In fact, I shipped over 1200 pull requests (PRs) in my first 3 years as an engineer, averaging ~1-2 PRs per day.</p><p>While the code velocity was high, I was focusing on the wrong things. Most of the PRs were dedicated to “perfecting” our codebase.</p><p>At the time, I thought I was doing great things. Who wouldn’t love the code to be spruced up? But looking back, I realized how I could have spent my time so much better.</p><p>Instead of perfecting code, often code that hadn’t been touched in years and didn’t need to be touched, I could have been adding value for the team.</p><p>Things like:</p><ul><li><p>Reducing the plate of my teammates, rather than adding to it with more code reviews to give them</p></li><li><p>Shipping the current feature faster and getting ahead on the next one</p></li><li><p>Asking my manager how I can help them more</p></li></ul><p>So, even though I shipped all those PRs early in my career, today I realize how meaningless it is.</p><p>If I had spent less time perfecting code, I could have shipped 50% fewer PRs and added 2x more value to the team.</p><p>Today, I’m lucky if I ship more than 3 PRs in a week. That’s because my focus is on working on the right things, which often means helping the team, creating partnerships, writing proposals, and scaling myself through docs. When I do ship code, it’s with clear intent to move value for the team or business.</p><p>Outside of this example, I avoid perfectionism by doing 3 things:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Writing down my priorities</strong><span> at the start of the week, which helps me know what’s most important to accomplish. Hint: It’s usually not perfecting something.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Shipping the smallest unit of value</strong><span> I can, either to internal or external customers. For example, shipping an 80% working prototype behind a feature flag to get early feedback internally.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Seeking early feedback</strong><span>. I set up 4-hour focus time blocks at the start of my day and make as much progress as I can. Then, I ask myself, “Based on what I accomplished, is there anything I should share or request feedback on?” I do this all the time with technical docs. I ask my team, “Am I going in a completely wrong direction here, or should I continue on this path?” Sometimes, I find there’s a simpler solution than my proposal, it’s already explored, or not valuable. That saves me hours of time from perfecting the doc.</span></p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e1da5-498c-4028-8c3d-257bfbc53493_1600x555.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e1da5-498c-4028-8c3d-257bfbc53493_1600x555.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e1da5-498c-4028-8c3d-257bfbc53493_1600x555.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e1da5-498c-4028-8c3d-257bfbc53493_1600x555.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e1da5-498c-4028-8c3d-257bfbc53493_1600x555.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e1da5-498c-4028-8c3d-257bfbc53493_1600x555.png" width="1456" height="505" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f95e1da5-498c-4028-8c3d-257bfbc53493_1600x555.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:505,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:314206,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e1da5-498c-4028-8c3d-257bfbc53493_1600x555.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e1da5-498c-4028-8c3d-257bfbc53493_1600x555.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e1da5-498c-4028-8c3d-257bfbc53493_1600x555.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e1da5-498c-4028-8c3d-257bfbc53493_1600x555.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Less perfection. More progress.</p><p>Perfectionism has been a problem for me starting from an early age. I’ve always wanted to make things the best quality possible, especially things that matter a lot to me.</p><p>It took a long time for me to realize it’s actually counter-productive. Here are the most prominent things that I wanted to perfect as a Software Engineer and a manager:</p><p><strong>I wanted to learn “perfectly” from tutorials</strong></p><p>In my early days as a self-taught engineer, I did SO much learning from tutorials.</p><p>Looking back at that time, I could see how I could have progressed much faster if I hadn’t wanted to always make sure that I finished every single tutorial 100%, plus with the mindset of “I shouldn’t miss any second of it”.</p><p><span>What I know now, the best way to learn from tutorials is to get what you need and apply that to your own project. Building your own project is the best way to learn. You can find more details about this here: </span><a href="https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/become-a-better-engineer-by-working" rel="">Become a better engineer by working on side projects</a><span> (paid article).</span></p><p><strong>I wanted to design “perfect” things</strong></p><p>In one of my student jobs as a Software Engineer, I was also doing a lot of design related things like designing banners, websites also doing some graphic design. I saw a repeating pattern when designing.</p><p>That pattern was that I would create a draft quite quickly, but then spend the 2-4x amount of time applying finishing touches. Which was quite counter-productive and also stressful for me.</p><p>I spent so much time trying to make sure it’s “pixel perfect”: right colors, right fonts, right spacing, etc. I would make so much more progress if I would just be fine with it. The funny thing is that the end result wasn’t much better than the first draft (maybe a tad more).</p><p><strong>I wanted to create “perfect” code</strong></p><p>Especially early on in my career as a Software Engineer, I would feel that I need to write perfect code, before showing it to others.</p><p>I spent so much time refactoring functions, renaming variables, rethinking the approach and overall looking for ways to optimize it. It was my impostor syndrome telling me that I was not good enough to do this.</p><p>That got me to the place where my overall progression was hurting and similar with designing → it caused additional stress to me.</p><p>I would be making SO much more progress if I would be focusing on good enough code and getting feedback early on! So much wasted time trying to “perfect”.</p><p><strong>As a manager, I wanted to wait for “perfect” timings and make “perfect” decisions</strong></p><p>I thought that my timing to give feedback needed to be perfect. Well, the outcome of waiting was that things got a lot worse.</p><p>I said to myself: “Maybe things will get better if I wait for a bit more time”. Well, the reality was that things didn’t. And my waiting for perfect timing made it a LOT worse.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7425a3-c8d3-45d9-98bc-fb5e42d76671_800x400.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7425a3-c8d3-45d9-98bc-fb5e42d76671_800x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7425a3-c8d3-45d9-98bc-fb5e42d76671_800x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7425a3-c8d3-45d9-98bc-fb5e42d76671_800x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7425a3-c8d3-45d9-98bc-fb5e42d76671_800x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7425a3-c8d3-45d9-98bc-fb5e42d76671_800x400.png" width="800" height="400" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bd7425a3-c8d3-45d9-98bc-fb5e42d76671_800x400.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:400,&#34;width&#34;:800,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:46210,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7425a3-c8d3-45d9-98bc-fb5e42d76671_800x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7425a3-c8d3-45d9-98bc-fb5e42d76671_800x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7425a3-c8d3-45d9-98bc-fb5e42d76671_800x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7425a3-c8d3-45d9-98bc-fb5e42d76671_800x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Similar to making decisions. “They need to be perfect”, I said to myself.
