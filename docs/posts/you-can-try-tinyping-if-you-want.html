    <h1>you can try tinyping, if you want</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, September 23, 2024</em></p><p>Despite not talking about it much, I&#39;m continuing to work on tinyping. In the spirit of working with the garage door up, you can try an <em>extremely early version</em> at <a href="https://app.tinyping.net">app.tinyping.net</a>. It mostly works, though! Pings are scheduled and stored appropriately, and you can edit tags for them. It also follows the Automerge project&#39;s advice on how to best structure documents to avoid the main document growing and growing forever (it stores pings in journal documents, one per month.)</p><p>If you decide to try that, be aware that it doesn&#39;t gracefully handle schema changes at all, in cases where the data storage format has to change. I&#39;m mostly just calling <code>localStorage.clear()</code> whenever in the console whenever I need. Don&#39;t put anything valuable in there; it&#39;ll get eaten.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p>Next step there is to make the UI actually nice. I don&#39;t think that will be awful to do, although the list of pings can feel a little overwhelming if you haven&#39;t filled them in for a while.</p><p>Oh, and if you&#39;re reading this and have a better idea for a name, please get in touch. I wanted to get the .com version of the name, but the owners of that domain want &#34;in the 5 figures of GBP&#34; and I&#39;m not gonna do that for a side project.</p></article></div>
