After I <a href="https://youtu.be/hxR-dexHiI4 ">Built my wood strength tester</a>,
two fellow YouTubers offered to send me some samples of different wood species.
These ones are from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhu-HDa_4dBgGMS_1nBnEQ">
Peter Collin</a>, already cut to size.

John from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO4AaIooUgGTlBH64KWO76w">FarmCraft 101</a>
sent me these samples.  Jon wasn&#39;t aware of the high cost of postage to Canada, so he
sent some bigger pieces to cut samples out of.  Postage was over $100 USD.

</p><p>

I also had some samples of my own to prepare.  I used to have a better selection of different woods,
but foolishly I didn&#39;t bring my wood stash with me on the last move in 2018.
</p><p>
<a href="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength08-b.jpg" bigw="950" bigh="534">

I planed all the pieces down to 17x17 mm.  Peter&#39;s pieces were 20x20 mm, which would
have been better for testing with, but the stepper motor driven screw jack on my machine will
only exert about 250 Kg reliably, or 550 lbs.  17x17 mm was about as large as I could go and
still break the pieces.
</p><p>
<a href="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength10-b.jpg" bigw="950" bigh="576">

I measured the length of each test piece, then weighed them all.  From that I worked
out the density relative to water for each piece.
</p><p>
My densest samples were Osage orange (0.93), Ironwood, a.k.a. American hornbeam (0.93), 
Dogwood (0.83), Hickory (0.80), Beech (0.76), and Hard maple (0.75).
</p><p>
The least dense samples were Cedar (0.31, 0.36), Pine (0.33), Spruce (0.33) and Basswood (0.37).
</p><p>
These were all for individual samples.  There is considerable variation in density between
pieces of wood of the same species.
</p><p>

<img src="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength12.jpg" width="500" height="287"/></a>
Test piece loaded into my tester.  The screw jack pushes up in the middle and the test piece is
held down by the round pieces on either side.  These are 24.5 cm apart, center to center.
</p><p>
A stepper motor turns the small gear, which turns the large gear clockwise.
This threads the nut downward.  The nut pushes against a bearing below it, pushing the threaded rod up.
</p><p>
The screw jack sits on a platform with four bathroom scale load cells to measure the force.  
The load cells are tared with the screw press already on them so there&#39;s no need to adjust for
the weight of the jack and stepper motor on th load cells.  I made a
<a href="https://youtu.be/hxR-dexHiI4 ">video about this testing machine</a>
</p><p>
A camera module in front of the setup takes a picture at the start of every test and another
after the piece has failed.
</p><p>

A python script running on a Raspberry Pi 3 runs everything.  A line is printed with each 0.1 mm
increment in jack displacement, showing the force in Kg, plus a line of &#39;#&#39; symbols to graph
the current force.  a &#39;+&#39; is also drawn to show the change in force from one reading to the next.
The current force, in Kg, is also shown large at the top right.
</p><p>

Because the apparatus is fairly stiff and applies displacement instead of force, once the wood
starts to fail, it typically doesn&#39;t snap all the way.  A partial crack is enough for the wood
to bend more and relieve some of the force.  Once my program sees a 10% drop in force from peak,
it deems the test piece to have already reached it&#39;s ultimate force, even if it hasn&#39;t
broken completely.  From previous experiments, I knew that large a drop in force was
the end, and pushing further would not increase the force above the previous peak.
</p><p>
Most hardwoods failed by fibers starting to tear on the tension side, though well before this,
the force graph showed that the wood itself was starting to yield (plastic defomration)
or fail, as the amount of additional force for each additional 0.1 mm of displacement went down.
During elastic deformation, force should linearly increase with displacement.
</p><p>

But some woods just snapped.
</p><p>

Once I got into a routine, each test took about 1.5 minutes.  Most test pieces were long enough that
I could break it in two places and get two data points.  Harriet (6 years old) came down to watch for 
a while, but she found it pretty boring.  I took the opportunity to listen to podcasts
while running tests.  This apparatus is a big improvement over watching the numbers on a
bathroom scale, which is how I had <a href="https://woodgears.ca/joint_strength/glue_methods.html">previously tested</a>
</p><p>

I started with 42 test pieces, but made a few more using woods I had
lying around, so I had over 50.  At two breaks each piece, it was about 100 breaks.

</p><p>
<a href="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength22-b.jpg" bigw="950" bigh="534">
<img src="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength22.jpg" width="500" height="281"/></a>
This one is &#34;dogwood&#34;, sent to me by Peter Collin.  I hadn&#39;t heard about dogwood before,
but its a very heavy, hard and resilient wood!
</p><p>
<a href="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength24-b.jpg" bigw="950" bigh="583">
<img src="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength24.jpg" width="500" height="307"/></a>
Some of the spruce pieces just snapped half instead of failing gradually.
Though it&#39;s more spectacular, I preferred that samples stay attached to each other after a
test.  Less messy and easier to keep track of.
</p><p>
<a href="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength26-b.jpg" bigw="950" bigh="506">
<img src="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength26.jpg" width="500" height="267"/></a>


</p><p>
<a href="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength28-b.jpg" bigw="950" bigh="534">
<img src="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength28.jpg" width="500" height="281"/></a>
This is the computer taking the &#34;final&#34; picture, after it has deemed the piece to have failed
because the force dropped by more than 10% from peak.
</p><p>
The dogwood sample had it&#39;s maximum force at 22 mm of deflection, whereas the strongest hard maple failed
at just 12 mm deflection.  This combination of large deflection and large force means it took
more energy to break the dogwood.  So dogwood would make an excellent wooden spring,
such as for making a bow.  I figured for a bow, you want wood that is strong, flexes lots, and is light.
So I added a column to my spreadsheet of numbers multiplying maximum force, deflection and maximum force,
divided by density.  The dogwood was the winner by that criteria, followed by Osage Orange.

</p><p>
<a href="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength30-b.jpg" bigw="950" bigh="568">
<img src="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength30.jpg" width="500" height="299"/></a>
Then again, looking at the yield curves, dogwood may have started plastic deformation
at around 80 Kg load, whereas Osage Orange&#39;s plastic deformation probably started around 150 Kg.
So Osage Orange may be a better lasting bow.  Repeated stressing to the point of plastic deformation
alters the wood, which is an aspect I didn&#39;t test.  But both Dogwood and Osage orange failed suddenly
and with a bang, as opposed to gradually starting to splinter with Hickory.  I think a more gradual
failure like with Hickory would be more desirable.  It would be interesting to take typical bow
wood samples and design a test procedure to specifically test the wood&#39;s ability to store
and recover energy as a spring, with repeated cycling.
</p><p>
White ash also did relatively well on that score.  It&#39;s no wonder my dad always used white ash for
axe handles.  Hickory is even better for axe handles, but there weren&#39;t any hickory trees where
we lived.

</p><p>
<a href="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength32-b.jpg" bigw="950" bigh="534">
<img src="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength32.jpg" width="500" height="281"/></a>
Interestingly, all the dark woods seemed to fail with a bang, either snapping, or
having a large part of the wood fail at once, while most of the lighter colored hardwoods
failed more gradually.
</p><p>
I think this sudden snapping is an undesirable quality for chairs.  you don&#39;t want a chair to
break from being knocked over by a kid, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend any dark woods for chairs.
</p><p>
<a href="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength34-b.jpg" bigw="950" bigh="578">
<img src="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength34.jpg" width="500" height="304"/></a>

After that I switched my apparatus to have a stiff iron bar instead of the workpiece,
and mounted a #3 Robertson screwdriver bit on top of my screw jack.  A #3 bit is 3/16&#34; or 4.76
mm square.  I changed the software to raise the jack until it hit 2 Kg of resistance, then push
a further 5 mm and measure the force required as a measure of hardness.  I didn&#39;t compensate
for flex in my apparatus, so the indentation depth on the hardest woods, with a quarter ton of force,
might have been as low as 3 mm.  But it&#39;s a relative measure anyway.
</p><p>
The common hardness criteria, the &#34;Janka hardness test&#34; involves measuring the force
needed to push a 0.444&#34; (11.3) mm steel ball half way into a piece of wood.  But this would
require bigger test pieces and over a ton of force for the harder woods.

</p><p>
<a href="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength38-b.jpg" bigw="950" bigh="534">
<img src="https://woodgears.ca/wood_strength/strength38.jpg" width="500" height="281"/></a>
I pressed two divots on each workpiece, on different sides.
As expected, the heavier woods scored much better on this than lighter woods.  Top samples
were Dogwood (252 Kg), Osage Orange (249 Kg), Ironwood (231 Kg), hard Maple (223 Kg), Cherry (214 Kg),
and white ash (209 Kg, 206 Kg), Hickory (196 Kg), and Beech (189 Kg).
</p><p>
Softest were Cedar (45 Kg), Pine (47 Kg), Spruce (55 Kg), Basswood (56 Kg)
</p><p>
With only a few samples, I can&#39;t say that this 100% representative of the species,
but it confirmed my gut feel
</p><p>
This score is useful for tables.  The more it takes to push a divot into the wood,
the less dinged up a table, floor, or any other furniture will get over time.
