    <h1>An Easy Fix</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You are an engineer at <em>40 More Servers Studios</em>, makers of the hit online game <strong>Facebreaker</strong>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 10am on a Thursday. Any other week, this would be patch day, but today it&#39;s not.</p>
<p>Instead, you&#39;ve got a clear calendar, no meetings, and only one bug left to fix before the end of the sprint tomorrow. It&#39;s a weird one, but you&#39;ve finally figured out how to fix it, and you&#39;re super happy about that.</p>
<p>Sure is a nice day you&#39;ve got planned. Would be a shame if something happened to it.</p></div></div>
