    <h1>Ask HN: Working in a VR Headset?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am working full remote right now(programming/gamedev) and I travel several times a year for periods of up to two months. Because of specifics of my job I need to have a powerful workstation(I mostly need a powerful CPU) and I am comfortable with at least two 27&#34; monitors. Traveling with that much stuff is only possible with a car, and even then the whole setup takes too much space.</p><p>Laptops are getting there with the compute power, but the 27&#34; monitors aren&#39;t getting any smaller. Meta Quest Pro(which seems to be the top of the line now) has been just released and even tho it is somewhat pricey($1500), it still costs as much as three good 27&#34; monitors.</p><p>Does anyone have any useful experience to share on working in a VR headset? Is it comfortable for longer periods of time? How is it on the eyes?</p></div></div></div>
