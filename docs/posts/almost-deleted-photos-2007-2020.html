    <h1>Almost deleted photos, 2007 - 2020</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="content">
<p>Last week, I deleted a bunch of old photos while trying to back them up.</p>
<p>By the numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>2793 photos deleted by accident</li>
<li>2531 restored from a backup through a complex, heavily manual process</li>
<li>160 restored from a copy on another computer</li>
<li>102 photos lost forever</li>
</ul>
<p>All the files lost were from 2019, but the files <em>almost</em> lost were from 2007 through to 2020.</p>
<p>The files I <em>almost</em> lost were saved by a backup. They were hard to get at though – stored somewhere online, encrypted using some buggy software. So the process I used to restore some of the photos was heavily manual, and I had to look through photo individually to make sure that they’d been recovered correctly. I’m still not 100% sure I did it right.</p>
<p>I don’t think I would’ve taken the time to have ever looked at those photos outside of this almost disaster (?), which kinda makes me wonder why I’m keeping them? I was planning on writing something about memories and legacy and ephemera, but I don’t think I currently have the wherewithal to extrude a precise idea from this experience. You know how every now and again there’s a meme on twitter that tells you to post the last 4 photos from your camera roll without context? Well, maybe this is that. Here’s a bunch of photos from the last 15 years. The “almost delete 2500 random photos from the last 15 years and then pick some of them and blog about them challenge”, if you will.</p>

<p>There were photos of me graduating from highschool; photos of my 18th birthday party at a pizza shop, photos from when a friend got really drunk on the first night of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoolies_week">schoolies</a> on box wine and took a bunch of “artistic selfies”.</p>

<p>Photos of weddings which I didn’t attend, where the people are now divorced, and who I don’t know very well; the photos are there because Whatsapp saves all your photos to your camera roll. A photo of the “Ladies Home Journal” which was sent to the US branch of my office sometime, for some reason, and I’d apparently snapchatted it to my partner asking if she had any idea what it was.</p>

<p>Blurry photos from a Windows Phone with cryptic notes about Canberra’s electricity grid. Photos from hikes in NSW, Australia, in 2008, 2013 and 2016. The 2016 one was an overnight hike in the Blue Mountains where I fell into a river while trying to wash up and then melted my shoes when trying to dry them by the fire.</p>

<p>A photo of a Tawny Frogmouth at a Nature Park in Western Sydney; I took a colleague there in 2014. He was under order to take a photo of a Quokka while in Australia because they were <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/quokka-selfie-trend-cute-rodent-australia/">all the rage on the internet at the time</a> and his partner was into cute shit like that.</p>

<p>My team at an job ten years ago, on a boat. A photo of a printout of the slides from a church service. What looks like it’s also a church service and I have no idea what’s going on here but I think I probably found it absurd at the time and that’s why I took the photo. Maybe it’s a <strong><em>BUSINESS PRESENTATION</em></strong>:</p>
