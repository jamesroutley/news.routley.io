    <h1>The British Library URL has been offline due to cyberattack for 10 days</h1>

	<p>We&#39;re experiencing a major technology outage following a cyber-attack affecting our website, online systems and services, and some onsite services. However, our buildings are still open as usual. We anticipate restoring more services in the next few weeks, but disruption to certain services is now expected to persist for several months.</p>

	<p>Last week the attackers released some of our data onto the dark web including some personal user information. We&#39;ve contacted our users to alert them to this incident and to offer advice from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on how to protect themselves, including updating their passwords on other systems.</p>

	<p>Because our systems are still unavailable, you can&#39;t change the password for our services. However, if you use the same password for non-British Library services, we recommend that you change it as a precaution.</p>
	
	<p>NCSC provides <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/information-for/individuals-families" target="_blank">guidance on staying secure online</a>, including how to create a strong password, and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/data-breaches" target="_blank">specific guidance for individuals who may have been impacted by a data breach</a>.</p>

	<p>Analysing the data is likely to take several months. Should we find specific information has been compromised, we will alert anyone affected as soon as we can. We are continuing to collaborate with the Metropolitan Police and professional cybersecurity advisors, and are receiving support from the NCSC.</p>

	<p>We&#39;re really sorry for the ongoing disruption to our systems and services and we&#39;ll provide further updates when we can.</p>
