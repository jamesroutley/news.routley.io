                                    <p>From the early eighteenth century onward, primacy for the invention of binary numeration and arithmetic was almost universally credited to the German polymath Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) (see, for example, [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="Francis Lieber, E.

Then, in 1922, Frank Vigor Morley (1899–1980) noted that an unpublished manuscript of the English mathematician, astronomer, and alchemist Thomas Harriot (1560–1621) contained the numbers 1 to 8 in binary. Morley’s only comment was that this foray into binary was “certainly prior to the usual dates given for binary numeration” [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="F.

Almost thirty years later, John William Shirley (1908–1988) published reproductions of two of Harriot’s undated manuscript pages, which, he claimed, showed that Harriot had invented binary numeration “nearly a century before Leibniz’s time” [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="John William Shirley.

But while Shirley correctly asserted that Harriot had invented binary numeration, he made no attempt to explain how or when Harriot had done so. Curiously, few since Shirley’s time have attempted to answer these questions, despite their obvious importance. After all, Harriot was, as far as we know, the first to invent binary. Accordingly, answering the <i>how</i> and <i>when</i> questions about Harriot’s invention of binary is the aim of this short paper.</p><p>The story begins with the weighing experiments Harriot conducted intermittently between 1601 and 1605. Some of these were simply experiments to determine the weights of different substances in a measuring glass, such as claret wine, seck (i.e., sack, a fortified wine), and canary wine (see [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Thomas Harriot.

Courtesy of the British Library Board.</p></div></div></figure></div></div><div><p>So far as I know, the only person who has attempted to explain Harriot’s transition from weighing experiments to the invention of binary is Donald E. Knuth, who writes:</p><blockquote><p>Clearly he [Harriot] was using a balance scale with half-pound, quarter-pound, etc., weights; such a subtraction was undoubtedly a natural thing to do. Now comes the flash of insight: he realized that he was essentially doing a calculation with radix 2, and he abstracted the situation [4, p. 241].</p></blockquote></div><div><p>While Knuth is mistaken about the size of weights used, apparently missing the abbreviation “troz” (= troy ounce) and taking the glyph <img src="https://media.springernature.com/lw32/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00283-023-10271-9/MediaObjects/283_2023_10271_Figh_HTML.gif" alt=""/>
 to refer to pound rather than ounce, his suggestion regarding Harriot’s “flash of insight” looks plausible. But it is possible to go further, because it is unlikely that Harriot hit upon binary notation simply because he was using weights in a power-of-2 ratio, something that was a well-established practice at the time. Equally if not more important was the fact that he <i>recorded the measurements made with these weights in a power-of-2 ratio too</i>. For when recording the weights of the various part-ounce measures, Harriot used a rudimentary form of positional notation, in which for every position he put down either the full place value or 0, depending on whether or not the weight in question had been used. Hence when weighing the first “glass and water,” Harriot’s result is equivalent to:</p><div><div><div data-component-scroll-wrapper=""><table><thead><tr><th><p>Position:</p></th><th><p>Ounces</p></th><th><p><span>\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> ounces</p></th><th><p><span>\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> ounces</p></th><th><p><span>\(\frac{1}{8}\)</span> ounces</p></th><th><p><span>\(\frac{1}{16}\)</span> ounces</p></th><th><p>Grains</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Harriot’s measurement:</p></td><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p><span>\(\frac{1}{8}\)</span></p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>28</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></div><div><p>Or indeed, if we just focus on the part-ounces and express them as powers of 2:</p><div><div><div data-component-scroll-wrapper=""><table><thead><tr><th><p>2<sup>–1</sup> ounce</p></th><th><p>2<sup>–2</sup> ounce</p></th><th><p>2<sup>–3</sup> ounce</p></th><th><p>2<sup>–4</sup> ounce</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>2<sup>–3</sup> ounce</p></td><td><p>0</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></div><p>From such a method of recording weights in a power-of-2 ratio, it is but a very small step to binary notation, in which, instead of noting in each position either 0 or the full place value, one simply puts down either 0 or 1 depending on whether or not the weight in question was needed. Harriot’s invention of binary therefore owed at least as much to his own idiosyncratic form of positional notation for recording part-ounce weights as it did to his use of those weights.</p><p>One oddity with Harriot’s “flash of insight” is that it did not lead him to binary expansions of reciprocals, which is what his notation is closest to. That is, he did not represent <span>\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> ounce as [0].1, <span>\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> ounce as [0].01, <span>\(\frac{1}{8}\)</span> ounce as [0.]001, or <span>\(\frac{1}{16}\)</span> ounce as [0].0001. Instead, he continued to use decimal fractions to record the part-ounce weights in his weighing experiments. So although binary was an outgrowth of Harriot’s idiosyncratic method of recording part-ounce weights, at no point did he use binary to record these weights. From that we may surmise that he did not think binary notation offered greater convenience or clarity than his own method of recording part-ounce weights.</p><div><p>Yet Harriot was sufficiently intrigued by his new number system to explore it over a further four manuscript pages, working out how to do three of the four basic arithmetic operations (all but division) in binary notation. On one sheet, Harriot wrote examples of binary addition (equivalent to 59 + 119 = 178 and 55 + 114 = 169) and subtraction (equivalent to 178 – 59 = 119 and 169 – 55 = 114) and the same example of multiplication in binary (109 × 109) as above, this time solved in two different ways (<a href="https://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuViewSB?url=%2Fmpiwg%2Fonline%2Fpermanent%2Flibrary%2FTRMFCPMB&amp;viewMode=images&amp;tocMode=thumbs&amp;tocPN=1&amp;query=&amp;searchPN=1&amp;queryType=&amp;mode=texttool&amp;characterNormalization=reg&amp;pn=693">Harriot, Add.

On yet another sheet, he jotted down a table of 0 to 16 in binary, a simple binary sum: 100000 + [0]1[00]1[0] = 110010 (i.e., 32 + 19 = 51), and another example of multiplication, 101 × 111 = 100011 (i.e., 5 × 7 = 35) (<a href="https://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuViewSB?tocMode=thumbs&amp;url=/mpiwg/online/permanent/library/HSPGZ0AE&amp;viewMode=images&amp;tocPN=1&amp;searchPN=1&amp;mode=texttool&amp;characterNormalization=reg&amp;query=&amp;pn=493&amp;queryType=">Harriot, Add.

The whole of Harriot’s work on binary is captured on the handful of manuscript pages described in this paper.</p><p>Now that we know how Harriot arrived at binary, it remains to ask when he did so. Although Harriot often recorded the date on his manuscripts, unfortunately he did not do so on any of the manuscript pages featuring binary numeration. As such, it is not possible to determine the exact date of his invention, though it can be narrowed down, as we shall see. Knuth conjectured that “Harriot invented binary arithmetic one day in 1604 or 1605” on the grounds that the manuscript containing a weighing experiment together with binary numeration and arithmetic is catalogued between one dated June 1605 and another dated July 1604 [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Donald.

As noted at the outset, Harriot’s weighing experiments began in 1601, indeed on September 22, 1601, and already in manuscripts from that year he was using his idiosyncratic method of recording part-ounce weights (see [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Thomas Harriot.

The latest date for Harriot’s invention of binary is probably November 1605, at which time Harriot’s patron, Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland (1564–1632), was imprisoned in connection with the Gunpowder Plot.</p><p>Around this time, Harriot, too, fell under suspicion of being involved in the plot and was imprisoned for a number of weeks before successfully pleading for his freedom. After his release, he did not resume his weighing experiments or, we may suppose, the investigations into binary that arose from them. This is perhaps unsurprising. Whereas Leibniz saw a practical advantage in using binary notation to illustrate problems and theorems involving the powers of 2 geometric sequence (see [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="Lloyd Strickland. Leibniz on number systems. In Handbook of the History and Philosophy of Mathematical Practice, edited by Bharath Sriraman. Springer, 2023." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00283-023-10271-9#ref-CR8" id="ref-link-section-d140822036e2802">8</a>]), Harriot appears to have treated binary as little more than a curiosity with no practical value.</p><p>Nevertheless, Harriot’s invention of binary is a startling achievement when you realize that the idea of exploring nondecimal number bases, as opposed to tallying systems, was not commonplace in the seventeenth century. While counting in fives, twelves, or twenties was well understood and widely practiced, the idea of numbering in bases other than 10 was not. The modern idea of a base for a positional numbering system was still coalescing, but it was conceived by a few, with Harriot perhaps the first. Unfortunately, despite his great insight, Harriot did not publish any of his work on binary, and his manuscripts remained unpublished until quite recently, being scanned and put online in 2012–2015. Although Harriot rightly deserves the accolade of inventing binary many decades before Leibniz, his work on it remained unknown until 1922, and so did not influence Leibniz or anyone else, nor did it play any part in the adoption of binary as computer arithmetic in the 1930s (see [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="Lloyd Strickland and Harry Lewis.

That is one accolade that still belongs to Leibniz.</p>
