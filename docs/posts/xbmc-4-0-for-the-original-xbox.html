	<span><em>A Major Modernization of the Killer App That Started It All</em></span>
</p>

<p>
	A new version of Xbox Media Center (XBMC), <strong>version 4.0</strong>, has been released. This version marks a significant update to the long-standing media center platform for the Original Xbox. This marks the first major advancement to the software since 2016 and represents a renewed commitment to preserving, modernizing, and extending the capabilities of one of the most <em>iconic</em> console homebrew applications ever created.
</p>

<p>
	XBMC has a long and influential history. In 2002, XboxMediaPlayer (XMP) was released and turned the console into a powerful multimedia device fit for the living room in an era when connecting a computer to a TV was quite novel. Later that same year, XMP merged with YAMP and became Xbox Media Player 2.0. A few years later, the software evolved into Xbox Media Center, or XBMC, which introduced a new interface, a plugin system powered by Python, and a robust skinning engine.
</p>

<p>
	XBMC eventually became so capable that it outgrew the Xbox entirely. By 2007, developers were working on PC ports and in 2010, the project split into two branches: one for general computers while the Xbox version became <em>XBMC4Xbox</em>, and each codebase was maintained from then on by separate teams. XBMC was later renamed to <a href="https://kodi.tv/" rel="external nofollow">Kodi</a> in 2014 and continues to be one of the most popular media center applications available. Even <a href="https://www.plex.tv/" rel="external nofollow">Plex</a> traces its roots back to XBMC. Plex began as <em>OSXBMC</em>, a Mac port of XBMC in late 2007, before becoming its own project in 2008. This means the Original Xbox helped shape not one but <em>two</em> of the biggest media center apps used today.
</p>

<p>
	The last official release of XBMC4Xbox arrived in <a href="https://www.xbmc4xbox.org.uk/2016/02/xbmc4xbox-3-5-3-is-out/" rel="external nofollow">February 2016</a> with version 3.5.3. Although the community never declared the project dead, meaningful updates became scarce. XBMC 4.0 continues that legacy by bringing a modern interface, updating it to be more inline with Kodi&#39;s modern codebase, and backporting features to the original 64MB RAM / Pentium-III hardware where it all began.
</p>

<p>
	This project is distinct and separate from <a href="https://github.com/Rocky5/XBMC4Gamers" rel="external nofollow">XBMC4Gamers</a>, the games-focused variation of XBMC4Xbox (v3.5.3) by developer Rocky5.
</p>

<h2>
	A Modern Interface Powered by Estuary
</h2>

<p>
	One of the most notable advancements in XBMC 4.0 is the introduction of the <strong>Estuary</strong> user interface (skin).
</p>

<p>
	Estuary, originally released in 2017 with Kodi v17 (&#34;<a href="https://kodi.wiki/view/Archive:Kodi_v17_(Krypton)_changelog" rel="external nofollow">Krypton</a>&#34;), provides a clean and modern layout that improves navigation and readability over past skins. Bringing Estuary to the Xbox required extensive updates to the underlying GUI framework, including a port of the more contemporary <em>GUIlib</em> engine. This allows the platform to support modern skinning standards and makes future skin ports much more straightforward. After the initial work of porting GUIlib was done, porting Estuary to the Xbox was a relatively simple process of tweaking a handful of configuration files and adding contextual features specific to the Xbox. The result is a modern, intuitive front end that retains the performance and responsiveness required on legacy hardware.
</p>

<p>
	Firing up an Xbox made in 2001 and being greeted by the same interface as what you&#39;d find if you were to download Kodi today onto your PC feels like a bit of magic, and helps keep this beloved classic console relevant and useful well into the modern era.

<h2>
	Expanded Games Library Support
</h2>

<p>
	XBMC 4.0 introduces a fully realized games library system. This enhancement brings the same level of metadata support found in the Movies and Music sections to Xbox and emulated games. Titles can now display artwork, descriptions, and other metadata, transforming the games section into a polished and user-friendly library. XBMC’s longstanding support for trainers remains intact, giving users the option to apply gameplay modifications for compatible titles. Emulated game collections benefit as well, with the ability to browse ROM libraries and launch them directly in a user’s preferred emulator.
</p>

</p>

<h2>
	Online Scrapers and Metadata Support
</h2>

<p>
	XBMC 4.0 restores full functionality to metadata scrapers for movies and television. This allows users to build rich media libraries complete with artwork, plot summaries, cast listings, and other information retrieved directly from online sources. XBMC 4.0 handles these tasks efficiently, even on the Xbox’s limited memory and processing power. Video playback continues to support 480p and 720p content, enabling the console to serve as a surprisingly capable media device for its age. Similar to Kodi, XBMC 4.0 supports filtering, building playlists, watch progress history for media, and intelligent handling of TV shows with seasons.
</p>

<video controls="" data-video-embed="">
		<source type="video/mp4" data-video-src="https://www.xbox-scene.info/uploads/monthly_2025_11/XBMC-Videos-Demo.mp4.0936a52a21eb4f9cf78f8aa93f1a1f8a.mp4"/><a data-fileext="mp4" data-fileid="2241" href="https://www.xbox-scene.info/applications/core/interface/file/attachment.php?id=2241&amp;key=49aa88211941b267f205ebe904748b23" rel="">XBMC-Videos-Demo.mp4</a>
	</video>


<p>
	Aside from scrapers for multimedia, support for rich library capabilities for games has also been added. XBMC has always been a media-first app, and now users can enjoy the library experience that they&#39;ve come to love for media now in the context of their games library <em>(more info below)</em>.
</p>

<h2>
	Improved Task Scheduling and Multitasking
</h2>

<p>
	Despite the constraints of the Xbox’s single-threaded 733MHz CPU, XBMC 4.0 includes improvements to task scheduling that allow multiple activities to run concurrently. Background library updates, metadata scraping, and audio/video playback can occur while users navigate and use other parts of the interface. These optimizations help ensure a fluid experience without compromising performance. Much work has been done &#34;under the hood&#34; to keep XBMC on task and within memory budgets while achieving multi-tasking on a console that wasn&#39;t exactly designed with it in mind. Users who own RAM and/or CPU upgraded consoles can also take advantage of the extra overhead, as XBMC 4.0 makes use of the extra horsepower for an even smoother experience. Utilizing an SSD with higher UDMA speeds will also yield an improvement in overall responsiveness.
</p>

<h2>
	Music Experience and Visualizers
</h2>

<p>
	Music playback has always been a strong element of XBMC, and version 4.0 maintains that focus. The Original Xbox is capable of high quality audio output, and XBMC continues to support lossless codecs such as FLAC. The release includes compatibility with various audio visualizers, including MilkDrop, which remains one of the most visually impressive and customizable audio visualization engines available. These features allow XBMC 4.0 to function not only as a media organizer, but also as an immersive audio display system.
</p>

<p>
	An online repository has been established and will be maintained moving forward where users can download legacy and newly-released add-ons as they become available. This repository is accessible without additional setup, right out of the box!

</p>

<h2>
	Add-ons and Python Support
</h2>

<p>
	XBMC 4.0 continues to offer an extendable architecture powered by Python-based add-ons. While the current release uses Python 2.7 for compatibility, work is underway to transition to Python 3.4.10 in the future, which may provide a path for backporting many newer Kodi add-ons. Even in its current state, XBMC 4.0 already supports a variety of community-developed add-ons that extend the system’s functionality, including tools for online video playback (i.e. YouTube), online weather services, and enhanced media organization.

<h2>
	Continuing the Legacy
</h2>

<p>
	XBMC has been a staple of the Original Xbox&#39;s homebrew scene since its inception in the early 2000&#39;s. This new update is a revival of the platform that helped shape the landscape of home media software and helps revitalize a codebase that has been somewhat stagnant for many years. This release honors that heritage while modernizing the experience for a new generation of enthusiasts and preserving the functionality of the Original Xbox as a versatile and capable media center.
</p>

<p>
	Although the hardware is decades old, the renewed effort behind XBMC 4.0 demonstrates that the platform still has room to grow and tricks up its sleeve. With ongoing development and a codebase designed with modern Kodi compatibility in mind, XBMC 4.0 represents a significant step forward into the continued development on the Original Xbox.
</p>

<p>
	The development team looks forward to continuing this work and expanding the possibilities of the Original Xbox for years to come. This version is the first of many to come, with lots of things cooking in the background. Keep an eye out for future releases by joining the <strong><a href="https://www.xbox-scene.info/discord/invite/XboxScene/" rel="">Xbox-Scene Discord</a></strong> and turning on notifications in the <strong><a href="https://discord.com/channels/770816616937160745/1440261544276394075" rel="external nofollow">xbmc-news</a></strong> channel or by periodically checking the project&#39;s Github page.
