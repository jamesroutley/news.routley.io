    <h1>Twitter/X will let people you&#39;ve blocked see your posts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>X will now make your posts visible to users you’ve blocked. In <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1838285460440862861">a reply on Monday</a>, X owner Elon Musk said the “block function will block that account from engaging with, but not block seeing, public post.”</p><p>Currently, X displays a “You’re blocked” message when trying to view the profile of a person who’s blocked you. In addition to blocking all posts, it also prevents you from seeing their replies, media, followers, and following list.</p><p>While a source at X told <em>The Verge</em> that the platform is making this change because people can already view posts from users who’ve blocked them when using another account or when logged out, several of us at <em>The Verge </em>(myself included) have noticed that X actually prevents you from viewing someone’s profile if you’re logged out.</p><p>Musk has been vocal about his dislike of the block button. Last year, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/06/09/elon-musk-says-twitter-is-going-to-get-rid-of-the-block-feature-enabling-greater-harassment/">he said the feature</a> “makes no sense” and that “it needs to be deprecated in favor of a stronger form of mute.” He also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/18/23837494/elon-musk-twitter-x-remove-blocking">threatened to stop letting users block people</a> on the platform completely, except for direct messages.</p><p>Even though X’s block button will continue to prevent someone from interacting with a person’s posts, they’ll still be able to see them, potentially making it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22275568/blocking-clubhouse-block-party-social-networks">easier for bad actors to continue harassing</a> their victims.</p></div></div></div>
