            <span>Abstract:</span>  The very recent claim on the discovery of ambient-pressure room-temperature
superconductivity in modified lead-apatite has immediately excited sensational
attention in the entire society, which is fabricated by sintering lanarkite
(Pb2SO5) and copper(I) phosphide (Cu$_3$P). To verify this exciting claim, we
have successfully synthesized Pb$_2$SO$_5$, Cu$_3$P, and finally the modified
lead-apatite Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O. Detailed electrical transport and
magnetic properties of these compounds were systematically analyzed. It turns
out that Pb$_2$SO$_5$ is a highly insulating diamagnet with a room-temperature
resistivity of ~7.18x10$^9$ <a href="http://Ohm.cm" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> and Cu$_3$P is a paramagnetic metal with a
room-temperature resistivity of ~5.22x10$^{-4}$ <a href="http://Ohm.cm" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a>. In contrast to the
claimed superconductivity, the resulting Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O
compound sintered from Pb$_2$SO$_5$ and Cu$_3$P exhibits semiconductor-like
transport behavior with a large room-temperature resistivity of ~1.94x10$^4$
<a href="http://Ohm.cm" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> although our compound shows greatly consistent x-ray diffraction
spectrum with the previously reported structure data. In addition, when a
pressed Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O pellet is located on top of a commercial
Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no
magnetic levitation was observed either. These results imply that the claim of
a room-temperature superconductor in modified lead-apatite may need more
careful re-examination, especially for the electrical transport properties.
