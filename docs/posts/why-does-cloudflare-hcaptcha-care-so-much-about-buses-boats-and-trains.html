<div><p>This week I started Recurse Center.</p>
<p>My goal is pretty simple: learn a lot more about programming and get a lot better at it.</p>
<p>As I start exploring the little corner of programming I have chosen to focus on, I wanted to note where I am starting from. Then, when I&#39;m done, I&#39;ll be able to look back and see how many branches of the knowledge tree I&#39;ve explored - deeply or at the surface.</p>
<p>So here&#39;s a summary of what I know about programming.</p>
<p>In college I took Introduction to Object Oriented Programming I and II. I worked in Java. From those classes I have a pretty strong grasp of the basics of OOP. I also have a good grasp on basic algorithms and data structures. But I didn&#39;t take a class explicitly on algorithmic analysis, so this is an area to go deeper.</p>
<p>I also took an Intro to Web Dev class during college and continued to dabble with it outside. That taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.</p>
<p>When I began at Capital One as an analyst, I spent a lot of time teaching myself how to wrangle data with SQL and then Python / Pandas. This got me familiar with Python - which I quickly preferred over Java. I learned a lot more as a PM, I&#39;ll circle back to that.</p>
<p>I had a lot of design experience and built a new no-code apps. Then I decided to teach myself to build real code apps. About a year ago I taught myself a fair bit of Django. I built and deployed a handful of basic tutorials, like a blog.</p>
<p>I also built a few more complex apps. I built a Twitter clone with a horrendous UI. But I was proud that users could log in, have a profile, a feed, etc. I even figured out a follower system from scratch and was happy about that.</p>
<p>Then I built a platform that allowed users to create their own job board. There were 2 types of accounts: job board hosts and companies. This had lots of different functionalities - but again with an ugly UI.</p>
<ul>
<li>A host could create an account and job board</li>
<li>Employers could submit jobs to a host&#39;s board</li>
<li>A host could then review and accept or decline postings</li>
<li>These would be available on the web for a host to share</li>
<li>Both hosts and employers had dashboards where they could see analytics on how many times posts had been viewed, links clicked through, etc.</li>
<li>There were lots of different authorizations and permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It probably took me 20 hours to build that. But I had never made anything so complex before. Getting a taste of what I could make in 20 hours with so little experience made me wonder what I could do if I focused on programming full time. And that&#39;s what brought me here.</p>
<p>Since I put that project on the back burner, I&#39;ve been reviewing the fundamentals of programming, how programs are structured and interpreted. I&#39;ve been using composingprograms.com as a resource to do so. Which is a condensed, Python based, version of The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. That&#39;s been eye opening and helped me really understand some of the things I learned in college on a much deeper level.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that in my year and a half as a PM on Capital One&#39;s Machine Learning Platform, I learned a hell of a lot about software engineering and data science. I learned a lot about how models are built and deployed in industry. I learned a lot about Kubernetes, Docker, containers, and scalable software infrastructure. So I think that will help me bridge the gap from novice to decent programmer much faster than I might have otherwise.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll follow this up with a separate post on my goals for RC. But just to provide a glimpse, some of my immediate plans include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting familiar with, and building a few projects using, Django Rest Framework.</li>
<li>Getting the minimum React knowledge I need to start connecting a Django back end and build some projects.</li>
<li>To train and deploy a ski-kit learn model, which a user can then interact with (send inputs, receive outputs) via a web interface.</li>
<li>Finish Composing Programs</li>
<li>Start reviewing Algorithms again.</li>
</ul>
