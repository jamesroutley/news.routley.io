    <h1>Ask HN: Is there no way to remove yourself from a delegated Gmail account?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>For context, my wife was given delegated email access to a Gmail account &gt;10 years ago and no longer has contact with the account admin. She&#39;d like to remove herself from this delegated access but multiple chats with Google support reps have indicated that the only way to do this is by contacting the account admin and asking to be removed.</p><p>I&#39;ve been looking into this and seen multiple forum threads of people delegated access by ex&#39;s, relatives who have passed away and the like who are unable to remove themselves from this access even if it&#39;s extremely painful.</p><p>It blows my mind that this isn&#39;t a feature that exists or that Google can&#39;t help you remove your _own_ delegated access.</p><p>Anyone encountered this before and found a solution?</p></div></div></div>
