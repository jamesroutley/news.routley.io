<p>Use 64-bit <tt>time_t</tt> on 32-bit architectures to avoid the &#39;year 2038 problem&#39; when the existing 32-bit signed int rolls over (potentially setting time back to 1900). Good technical details are given on this <a href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Y2038ProofnessDesign">glibc page</a>, and a very general overview at <a href="https://theyear2038problem.com/">https://theyear2038problem.com/</a> <span id="line-38"></span><span id="line-39"></span></p><p>This FOSDEM <a href="https://video.fosdem.org/2023/UA2.114%20(Baudoux)/fixing_2038.webm">talk</a> <a href="https://wookware.org/talks/yr2038-fosdem.pdf">(PDF)</a> also gives a good overview of the status as of Feb 2023 <span id="line-40"></span><span id="line-41"></span></p><p>This is now less that 15 years away and plenty of system that will have problems have already been shipped. We should stop adding to the problem. Most computing, especially computing using Debian or its derivatives, is now done on 64-bit hardware where this issue does not arise. However there is quite a lot of cost-sensitive 32-bit computing still out there, and still shipping new devices (automotive, IOT, TVs, routers, plant control, building monitoring/control, cheap Android phones). Some of that hardware will probably be running Debian or its derivatives. Other binary distros are dropping 32-bit support (RedHat/Fedora have already done so, SUSE&#39;s support is unofficial), so what is left is more likely to end up in the Debian ecosystem. Most such new hardware will be running build-from-source OSes like OpenEmbedded, or Alpine, Android, or Gentoo, but the Debian-based niche is likely to remain for some years, and some stuff built with it is likely to be in use/installed for long enough to hit Jan 2038. <span id="line-42"></span><span id="line-43"></span></p><p>Debian is primarily concerned about the armhf architecture as the one 32-bit architecture most likely to still be getting significant usage in new systems over the next decade. But i386, armel, mipsel (and hppa, hurd-i386, powerpc, m68k, and sh4 ports) are also affected. Other 32-bit architectures already use 64-bit time: x32, riscv32, arc, and loong32. <span id="line-44"></span><span id="line-45"></span></p><p>64-bit architectures are not affected by the y2k38 problem, but they are affected by this transition. <span id="line-46"></span><span id="line-47"></span></p><p>Because you have to have LFS if you have 64-bit <tt>time_t</tt> (glibc enforces this), this goal is a superset of <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/LFS">ReleaseGoals/LFS</a>. <span id="line-48"></span><span id="line-49"></span></p><h2 id="Background">Background</h2>
<p><tt>time_t</tt> appears all over the place. 6429 of Debian&#39;s 35960 packages have <tt>time_t</tt> in the source. <span id="line-52"></span>Packages which expose structs in their ABI which contain <tt>time_t</tt> will change their ABI. All such libraries need to migrate together, as is the case for any library ABI change. <span id="line-53"></span><span id="line-54"></span></p><p>glibc 2.34 provides support for both the existing 32-bit ABI/API and a new 64-bit ABI/API. However it does not provide a switch forcing use of the new API/ABI - each build/package chooses explicitly to use the 64bit API/ABI (by setting <tt>_TIME_BITS=64</tt>). This is a problem for Debian as in a normal transition we expect that simply building against the new library will get you the new ABI. <span>Something</span> (glibc, dpkg, gcc?) has to say &#39;use 64-bit time by default&#39;. <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/1030159" title="DebianBug">1030159</a> has implemented a DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=abi=+time64 option as a consistent Debian mechanism. <span id="line-55"></span><span id="line-56"></span></p><p>This transition is similar to the LFS (Large Filesystem Support) transition, where glibc also provided both 32-bit and 64-bit APIs and using the 64-bit ABI (by setting <tt>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64</tt> (or <tt>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=abi=+lfs</tt> which does the same thing)) changes the ABI. And just to add to the fun if you set 64-bit time then glibc enforces 64-bit file offsets so software that has not dealt with support for LFS will also have to fix that in order to move to 64-bit time. (There are about 75 libraries that change ABI for LFS, but not time_t). <span id="line-57"></span><span id="line-58"></span></p><h3 id="Other_projects">Other projects</h3>

<p>We could either transition the ABI within the existing architecture(s), or we can bootstrap a new architecture (with a new triplet and ABI). Initial thoughts were that it was highly uncertain that a transition in place was feasible because too much stuff would break, and thus a new arch was simpler, safer and easier.  <span id="line-73"></span><span id="line-74"></span></p><p>New triplet:  <span id="line-75"></span></p><ul><li>Strictly speaking a new ABI should mean a new triplet, but in fact we do ABI-changing migrations within an existing triplet all the time (most SONAME changes).  <span id="line-76"></span></li><li>If Debian used a new triplet for the new ABI, but all the rest of the Linux world migrated the ABI within the existing triplet it would become very unclear what the existing &#39;arm-linux-gnueabihf&#39; triplet means. It&#39;s quite important that there is cross-distro agreement about the way forward here.  <span id="line-77"></span></li><li>There has been very little interest in a new triplet from other distros. <span id="line-78"></span><span id="line-79"></span></li></ul><p>ABI transition: <span id="line-80"></span></p><ul><li>Research to date has suggested that a standard ABI transition will be feasible. <span id="line-81"></span></li><li><p>We&#39;ve done large ABI transitions before like LFS and libc5-&gt;libc6. So treating this as just another migration makes sense. <span id="line-82"></span><span id="line-83"></span></p></li></ul><p>We also need to choose whether to do this for all our 32-bit architectures or not, for example one could decide that x32 fulfills the &#39;32-bit x64 with 64-bit time&#39; role and i386 should remain with 32-bit time for compatibility reasons (the ability to run ancient x86 binaries, especially proprietary ones that cannot be updated). <span id="line-84"></span><span id="line-85"></span></p><h3 id="Decision">Decision</h3>
<p>After a long discussion (mostly about i386) it was decided to do an in-architecture ABI transition for all 32-bit architectures except i386 (and hurd-i386). <span id="line-88"></span><span id="line-89"></span></p><p>The i386 port will be left with the existing 32-bit time_t, as a compatibility architecture for existing x86 binaries. A new &#39;i686&#39; x86 ABI/architecture using 64-bit time, and potentially newer ISA features, could be created if there was sufficient enthusiasm for dragging 32-bit x86 into its now very limited future. The hurd-i386 port is not going to be switched, as its kernel lacks support, and efforts are underway instead to switch to hurd-amd64. <span id="line-90"></span><span id="line-91"></span></p><p>So, in summary: <span id="line-92"></span><span id="line-93"></span></p><ul><li>amd64, arm64, mips64el, ppc64el, riscv64, s390x are all 64-bit, so they already had 64-bit time_t <span id="line-94"></span><ul><li>- non-release architectures in the same category:  alpha hurd-amd64 ia64 loong64 ppc64 sparc64 <span id="line-95"></span><span id="line-96"></span></li></ul></li><li>i386 is 32-bit but has been excluded from the 64-bit time_t transition because its major purpose this decade is running legacy 32-bit binaries, a purpose that would no longer be possible if it broke ABI <span id="line-97"></span><ul><li>- non-release architectures in the same category: hurd-i386 <span id="line-98"></span><span id="line-99"></span></li></ul></li><li>There is currently no release architecture that is 32-bit but already had a 64-bit time_t prior to 2024 <span id="line-100"></span><ul><li>- non-release architectures in this category: x32 <span id="line-101"></span><span id="line-102"></span></li></ul></li><li>armel, armhf are the two 32-bit release architectures which are changing ABI <span id="line-103"></span><ul><li>- non-release architectures in the same category: hppa m68k powerpc sh4 <span id="line-104"></span><span id="line-105"></span></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="Transition_in_place">Transition in place</h3>
<p>We have done large ABI break transitions before such as libc5 -&gt; libc6 (&#39;g&#39; suffix - which still remains today in libpam0g and zlib1g!), and GCC 4.0 C++ ABI (&#39;c2&#39; suffix). However those affected all architectures, not just old 32 bits ones. We have also done transitions which only affected &#39;minor&#39; architectures such as the long double migration from 64-bit to 128 bit on alpha, powerpc, sparc, s390 (2007) (&#39;ldbl&#39; suffix). <span id="line-108"></span><span id="line-109"></span></p><p>A large in-place transition will affect all of Debian, but only benefit the remaining 32-bit arches, so we do need to try and do this reasonably efficiently in order not to hold things up for too long. Fallout from breakage should fall almost entirely on the 32-bit arches that are changing ABIs. <span id="line-110"></span><span id="line-111"></span></p><h2 id="How_to_help">How to help</h2>

<p>People are rightly worried about stuff that will break when <tt>time_t</tt> is changed for some but not all of the packages on a running system. However not that many things which will actually break have so far been found. <span id="line-123"></span><span id="line-124"></span></p><p>Because some 32-bit arches have been using 64-bit time for some years, and x86 already went through the 32 -&gt; 64-bit transition so things like file-formats have generally been made interoperable, quite a lot of things that were problems have already been dealt with. <span id="line-125"></span><span id="line-126"></span></p><p>The largest area of uncertainty is in possible issues with changing file formats, database structures, data passed between programs over IPC mechanisms. <span id="line-127"></span><span id="line-128"></span></p><p>So far as I can determine most language runtimes do not appear to have problems here except insofar as they have C-library interfaces. Those issues resolve to the known C/C++ ABI issue. <span id="line-129"></span></p><ul><li>Haskell will change ABI, but then it changes ABI all the time anyway, and has mechanisms to deal with it. <span id="line-130"></span></li><li>Rust is all statically linked anyway so should not expose any ABI changes, except for external C/C++-libaries. <span id="line-131"></span></li><li>Java, Perl, Python, Go and Ruby all have a consistent internal time representation so will only expose ABI changes on C/C++-library linkage. <span id="line-132"></span><span id="line-133"></span></li></ul><p>Another source of issue is packages that fails building with the time64 build flags on.

This probably cannot reasonably be done by maintainer scripts and will therefore require manual intervention by the user. (It may be possible to write a migration program that avoids the need for a complete rebuild, but this has not yet been done.)
