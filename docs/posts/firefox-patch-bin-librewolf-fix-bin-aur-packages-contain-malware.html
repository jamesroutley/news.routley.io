    <p>On the 16th of July, at around 8pm UTC+2, a malicious AUR package was 
uploaded to the AUR. Two other malicious packages were uploaded by the 
same user a few hours later. These packages were installing a script 
coming from the same GitHub repository that was identified as a Remote 
Access Trojan (RAT).

The affected malicious packages are:

-  librewolf-fix-bin
-  firefox-patch-bin
-  zen-browser-patched-bin

The Arch Linux team addressed the issue as soon as they became aware of 
the situation. As of today, 18th of July, at around 6pm UTC+2, the 
offending packages have been deleted from the AUR.

We strongly encourage users that may have installed one of these 
packages to remove them from their system and to take the necessary 
measures in order to ensure they were not compromised.</p>
