    <h1>W3C Proposes the Creation of a WebView Community Group</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<pre id="body"><a name="start" accesskey="j" id="start"></a>The WebView Community Group has been proposed:

--------------------------------------------------

The WebViews Community Group aims to identify, understand and reduce the
issues arising from the use of software components (typically referred
as WebViews) that are used to render Web technology-based content
outside of a Web browser (Native Apps, MiniApps, etc). See the  proposed
charter  that scopes its first expected phase of work.

--------------------------------------------------

You are invited to support the creation of this group:
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/groups/proposed#webview">http://www.w3.org/community/groups/proposed#webview</a>

Once the group has a total of five supporters, it will be launched and
people can join to begin work. Once launched, the group will no longer
be listed as &#34;proposed&#34;; it will appear in the list of current groups:
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/groups/">http://www.w3.org/community/groups/</a>

In order to support the group, you will need a W3C account. To request one:
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/accounts/request">http://www.w3.org/accounts/request</a>

If you believe that there is an issue with this group that requires
the attention of the W3C staff, please send us email on
site-comments@w3.org.

Thank you,
W3C Community Development Team
