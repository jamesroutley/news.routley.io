    <h1>Burial chamber of an ancient Egyptian priestess is discovered after 4k years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>An &#39;extraordinary&#39; burial chamber containing the remains of an ancient Egyptian priestess has been unearthed after nearly 4,000 years. </p><p>Idy, the daughter of a wealthy governor who lived around 1880 BC, was found in a coffin within another coffin in a tomb in the city of Asyut, 200 miles south of Cairo. </p><p>Described as &#39;some of the most amazing coffins ever found&#39;, they&#39;re covered with text and illustrations &#39;describing the journey of the deceased in the afterlife&#39;. </p><p>Following her death, Idy&#39;s internal organs – her liver, spleen, lungs and intestines – were removed and place into jars. </p><p>Idy&#39;s body was then mummified – a process of preserving the body after death by deliberately drying or embalming the flesh. </p><p>Preliminary study of her bones indicate that she died before the age of 40 after suffering from a congenital foot defect. </p><p>She was also found with grave goods including a dagger and wooden figurines, which may have been intended for her use in the afterlife. </p><p>Professor Jochem Kahl, an archeologist at Freie Universität <a target="_self" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/berlin/index.html" id="mol-1aa377f0-9c42-11ef-988d-479f6efeccc2">Berlin</a> who led the discovery, called it &#39;both aesthetically and scientifically extraordinary&#39;. </p><div>  <p>Idy’s &#39;beautifully-decorated&#39; coffins are among the most impressive finds in the burial chamber</p></div><div>  <p>Idy - depicted in this engraving - was the only daughter of Djefai-Hapi I, a regional Egyptian governor who was worshiped in antiquity</p></div><p>Excavations took place between August 18 and September 17 this year. </p><p>&#39;The uncovering of this shaft began in 2022, took three excavation campaigns and has now ended with a sensational discovery – the burial of Idy in two nested wooden coffins with numerous grave goods,&#39; Professor Kahl said. </p><p>Idy was the only daughter of Djefai-Hapi I, a regional Egyptian governor who was worshiped in antiquity. </p><p>He was &#39;one of the most important rulers of the territories in ancient Egypt&#39;, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said <a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/tourismandantiq/posts/pfbid0FYRrffVAtu5qPursa9tPXcTFJhmdQA4fq8nkkydySsCh6tnTsmabQ5gRXJaZ1CFMl">in a Facebook statement</a>. </p><p>Professor Kahl added: &#39;Djefai-Hapi I was deified in ancient times and his tomb was an integral part of the cultural memory of ancient Egypt for more than 2000 years.&#39; </p><p>&#39;Idy was a priestess of the goddess Hathor and was called &#34;mistress of the house&#34;, which identifies her as a woman from a wealthy family.&#39; </p><p>While the resting place of the father had been known, this new discovery of his daughter&#39;s remains in the same building at Asyut is unprecedented. </p><p>The tomb, dating from around 1880 BC, is impressive due to its &#39;monumental&#39; rock architecture with rooms over 36 feet (11 metres) high carved into the rock.</p><div>  <p>Excavations took place between August 18 and September 17 this year. Pictured, Idy&#39;s burial chamber when discovered</p></div><div>  <p>Pictured, a close-up of the outer coffin of Idy, showing remarkable illustrations that were made nearly 4,000 years ago</p></div><div>  <p>Asyut, a city in Egypt that sits comfortably along the west bank of the Nile river, was a prosperous regional capital and port city</p></div><p>Idy had been placed in a coffin inside a coffin and then sealed in a side chamber in a vertical shaft about 45 feet deep that had been dug in the tomb of her father.</p><p>Her coffins, weighing around 200-300 kg each, are above average in size with a length of 8.59 feet (2.62 metres) and 6.66 feet (2.03 metres). </p><p>Professor Kahl said both coffins seem to be made out of &#39;foreign wood&#39;, meaning wood sourced from outside of Egypt. </p><p>He said they are both &#39;completely decorated with wonderful images and texts&#39; describing the journey of the deceased in the afterlife.</p><p>Their study will allow &#39;new and far-reaching statements to be made about the position of women and the transfer of knowledge in ancient Egypt&#39;. </p><p>While Idy&#39;s resting place has until now been unnoticed by researchers, it&#39;s thought the chamber was ransacked by thieves thousands of years ago. </p><p>Her remains were robbed of all jewelry and metal objects in the search for treasures, but other grave goods seem to have been of no interest to the ancient looters. </p><p>&#39;Remnants of Idy&#39;s garment and her bones, which were completely torn to shreds by ancient looters, provide information about her person,&#39; added Professor Kahl. </p><div>  <p>Idy was found in two nested wooden coffins with numerous grave goods, including wooden figurines. Pictured, a female figure made of wood</p></div><p>According to an initial visual inspection of the bones, Idy was probably around 40 years old and suffered from a foot problem, he added. </p><p>Somewhat gruesomely, a box of jars were also found containing Idy&#39;s internal organs removed during mummification – liver, spleen, lungs and intestines. </p><p>This was customary during mummification, as the ancient Egyptians learned the internal organs would decay quickly. </p><p>Typically, mummification in ancient Egypt then involved desiccating the body with a mixture of salts and then wrapping it in cloth soaked in a balm of plant extracts, oils, and resins. </p><p>Older mummies are believed to have been naturally preserved by burying them in dry desert sand and were not chemically treated. </p><p>Professor Kahl said further study of the discovered remains will continue in an effort to shed more light on the lives of the governor and his daughter. </p><p>&#39;After an initial conservational consolidation of the wooden objects in the burial chamber and the subsequent laborious recovery from the narrow, 14-metre deep shaft, the finds will be handed over to the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism,&#39; he added. </p></div></div>
