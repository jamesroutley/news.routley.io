    <h1>LinkedIn forcing me to disclose my phone number to log in? No thanks</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve used Linkedin for over two decades. Now I&#39;m being forced to disclose my mobile number in order to log in.</p><p>Given their track record of being hacked, I&#39;m reluctant to share it with them.</p><p>Moreover, I&#39;m already inundated with spam phone calls, and I&#39;m not looking for another source. This is a thinly veiled attempt to harvest my data so they can hide it in a page with six dozen toggles which will periodically make my phone number visible to people who buy it if I am not logging into check what they&#39;ve changed every day. Have you seen how difficult it is to opt-out of email notifications using their website?</p><p>If they were actually concerned about my security, they would give me other 2FA options that are more secure, like a Yubikey or authenticator application.</p><p>No thanks. I&#39;m done with Linkedin.</p></div></div></div>
