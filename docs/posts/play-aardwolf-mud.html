<p>You can play the game solo or group with other players, focus on gaining experience and levels, take part in hundreds of quests, solve puzzles, explore, map, play casino games for in-game currency, join a clan, take part in our forums, enchant and craft equipment, compete with other players in
player-vs-player combat and global quests, answer trivia, create your own
private manor, experiment with hundreds of spells and skills and even, eventually, build your own additions to the world.</p>
<p>If you have never played a text based RPG before, we offer an extensive in-game help system to help you get started and a team of volunteer
&#34;helpers&#34; who answer questions in real time. We also have a very detailed
starting area called &#34;The Aylorian Academy&#34; - your first major quest in the
game where you are guided through playing Aardwolf in an interactive format.</p>
