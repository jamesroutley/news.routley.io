    <h1>Ask HN: Reading material on how to be a better software engineer?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I’ve gotten to be quite good at the actual coding part after a decade or so of programming. I’m not looking for better code practices, although I’ll obviously still learn and grow there.</p><p>What I’m seeking is reading material regarding how to manage project scope, be better team member, converting asks to deliverables, managing expectations from management, enabling team members by opening communication channels across teams, time management, etc.</p><p>Any suggested reading material? Preferably books, but excellent blog posts are welcome.</p></div></div></div>
