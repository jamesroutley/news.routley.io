to see what ChatGPT was telling people.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I was stunned at first that it was so incorrect,&#34; he told Australian broadcaster ABC News.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s one thing to get something a little bit wrong, it&#39;s entirely something else to be accusing someone of being a criminal and having served jail time when the truth is the exact opposite. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I think this is a pretty stark wake-up call.
