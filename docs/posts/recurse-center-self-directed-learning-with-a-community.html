    <h1>Recurse Center: Self Directed Learning with a Community</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s the beginning of Week 3 out of the 6 week half-batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/about">Recurse Center</a>.</p><p>If you’re unfamiliar, RC is a free, self-directed retreat for programmers to “work at the edge of your abilities, develop your volitional muscles, and learn generously” and that really describes what it’s like.</p><p>I’m remote but there’s a lot of opportunities to connect (and the option to opt-out). Daily check-ins are like stand ups. Self-organized recurring study groups are common. We even started a weekly in-person coworking session in LA.</p><p>I landed on a couple goals early on.</p><ol><li>Contribute regularly to PyTorch with the goal of contributing to a major feature.</li><li>Learn the in’s and out’s of ML / AI and share learnings along the way.</li><li>Join a team building cutting-edge ML / AI solutions to solve pressing and meaningful problems.</li></ol><h3 id="heading-contributing-to-pytorch">Contributing to PyTorch<a href="#heading-contributing-to-pytorch"><span role="text"> permalink</span><svg fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" width="1em" height="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M9.199 13.599a5.99 5.99 0 0 0 3.949 2.345 5.987 5.987 0 0 0 5.105-1.702l2.995-2.994a5.992 5.992 0 0 0 1.695-4.285 5.976 5.976 0 0 0-1.831-4.211 5.99 5.99 0 0 0-6.431-1.242 6.003 6.003 0 0 0-1.905 1.24l-1.731 1.721a.999.999 0 1 0 1.41 1.418l1.709-1.699a3.985 3.985 0 0 1 2.761-1.123 3.975 3.975 0 0 1 2.799 1.122 3.997 3.997 0 0 1 .111 5.644l-3.005 3.006a3.982 3.982 0 0 1-3.395 1.126 3.987 3.987 0 0 1-2.632-1.563A1 1 0 0 0 9.201 13.6zm5.602-3.198a5.99 5.99 0 0 0-3.949-2.345 5.987 5.987 0 0 0-5.105 1.702l-2.995 2.994a5.992 5.992 0 0 0-1.695 4.285 5.976 5.976 0 0 0 1.831 4.211 5.99 5.99 0 0 0 6.431 1.242 6.003 6.003 0 0 0 1.905-1.24l1.723-1.723a.999.999 0 1 0-1.414-1.414L9.836 19.81a3.985 3.985 0 0 1-2.761 1.123 3.975 3.975 0 0 1-2.799-1.122 3.997 3.997 0 0 1-.111-5.644l3.005-3.006a3.982 3.982 0 0 1 3.395-1.126 3.987 3.987 0 0 1 2.632 1.563 1 1 0 0 0 1.602-1.198z"></path></svg></a></h3><p>So far, the strategy for contributing to PyTorch has been to start small. There’s a “good first issue” tag for people to start contributing. The goal is to get familiar with a small part of the codebase, build and run tests locally, and learn how PRs are submitted, reviewed and merged. Much like your first week at a new company.</p><p>So far, so good. I have a <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/117224">second PR</a> approved and ready to merge - even if it’s a one line change. It was good practice on reading a Github issue, understanding what and where the issue was, and writing a clean change that would be accepted into the codebase.</p><h3 id="heading-learning-ai-ml">Learning AI / ML<a href="#heading-learning-ai-ml"><span role="text"> permalink</span><svg fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" width="1em" height="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M9.199 13.599a5.99 5.99 0 0 0 3.949 2.345 5.987 5.987 0 0 0 5.105-1.702l2.995-2.994a5.992 5.992 0 0 0 1.695-4.285 5.976 5.976 0 0 0-1.831-4.211 5.99 5.99 0 0 0-6.431-1.242 6.003 6.003 0 0 0-1.905 1.24l-1.731 1.721a.999.999 0 1 0 1.41 1.418l1.709-1.699a3.985 3.985 0 0 1 2.761-1.123 3.975 3.975 0 0 1 2.799 1.122 3.997 3.997 0 0 1 .111 5.644l-3.005 3.006a3.982 3.982 0 0 1-3.395 1.126 3.987 3.987 0 0 1-2.632-1.563A1 1 0 0 0 9.201 13.6zm5.602-3.198a5.99 5.99 0 0 0-3.949-2.345 5.987 5.987 0 0 0-5.105 1.702l-2.995 2.994a5.992 5.992 0 0 0-1.695 4.285 5.976 5.976 0 0 0 1.831 4.211 5.99 5.99 0 0 0 6.431 1.242 6.003 6.003 0 0 0 1.905-1.24l1.723-1.723a.999.999 0 1 0-1.414-1.414L9.836 19.81a3.985 3.985 0 0 1-2.761 1.123 3.975 3.975 0 0 1-2.799-1.122 3.997 3.997 0 0 1-.111-5.644l3.005-3.006a3.982 3.982 0 0 1 3.395-1.126 3.987 3.987 0 0 1 2.632 1.563 1 1 0 0 0 1.602-1.198z"></path></svg></a></h3><p>My first topic was the Transformer architecture. Given how much it revolutionized the deep learning space, it was a clear starting point.</p><p>I spent a lot more time than I estimated to clearly understand and then communicate the ideas behind the architecture. I thought it’d take 1 - 2 days. It took me closer to 5-7 days. It’s good to estimate beforehand, benchmark, and adjust your future estimates - much like day-to-day work at a job.</p><p>I shared it to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lam-roger_transformers-explained-really-activity-7149947772060770305-xCdN?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">LinkedIn</a> and it got good reach and reception. It’s good to be in the zeitgeist if you don’t already have a lot of followers / distribution. Twitter was more like tweeting into the void.</p><h3 id="heading-next">Next<a href="#heading-next"><span role="text"> permalink</span><svg fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" width="1em" height="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M9.199 13.599a5.99 5.99 0 0 0 3.949 2.345 5.987 5.987 0 0 0 5.105-1.702l2.995-2.994a5.992 5.992 0 0 0 1.695-4.285 5.976 5.976 0 0 0-1.831-4.211 5.99 5.99 0 0 0-6.431-1.242 6.003 6.003 0 0 0-1.905 1.24l-1.731 1.721a.999.999 0 1 0 1.41 1.418l1.709-1.699a3.985 3.985 0 0 1 2.761-1.123 3.975 3.975 0 0 1 2.799 1.122 3.997 3.997 0 0 1 .111 5.644l-3.005 3.006a3.982 3.982 0 0 1-3.395 1.126 3.987 3.987 0 0 1-2.632-1.563A1 1 0 0 0 9.201 13.6zm5.602-3.198a5.99 5.99 0 0 0-3.949-2.345 5.987 5.987 0 0 0-5.105 1.702l-2.995 2.994a5.992 5.992 0 0 0-1.695 4.285 5.976 5.976 0 0 0 1.831 4.211 5.99 5.99 0 0 0 6.431 1.242 6.003 6.003 0 0 0 1.905-1.24l1.723-1.723a.999.999 0 1 0-1.414-1.414L9.836 19.81a3.985 3.985 0 0 1-2.761 1.123 3.975 3.975 0 0 1-2.799-1.122 3.997 3.997 0 0 1-.111-5.644l3.005-3.006a3.982 3.982 0 0 1 3.395-1.126 3.987 3.987 0 0 1 2.632 1.563 1 1 0 0 0 1.602-1.198z"></path></svg></a></h3><p>The new year has begun and I feel more motivated than ever. RC has given structure and peers that I missed having at a traditional working environment. I’m excited to continue learning and sharing with others to learn too. I believe we’re at the beginning of the next technological revolution - whether people compare it to harnessing electricity, breakthroughs from genome sequencing, or the creation of the database, having machines discover and decide for us will define the next decade.</p></div></div>
