<p>Hello! I was talking to a friend about how git works today, and we got onto the
topic – where does git store your files? We know that it’s in your <code>.git</code>
directory, but where exactly in there are all the versions of your old files?</p>

<p>For example, this blog is in a git repository, and it contains a file called
<code>content/post/2019-06-28-brag-doc.markdown</code>. Where is that in my <code>.git</code> folder?
And where are the old versions of that file? Let’s investigate by writing some
very short Python programs.</p>

<h3 id="git-stores-files-in-git-objects">git stores files in <code>.git/objects</code></h3>

<p>Every previous version of every file in your repository is in <code>.git/objects</code>.
For example, for this blog, <code>.git/objects</code> contains 2700 files.</p>

<pre><code>$ find .git/objects/ -type f | wc -l
2761
</code></pre>

<p><small>
note: <code>.git/objects</code> actually has more information than “every previous version
of every file in your repository”, but we’re not going to get into that just yet
</small></p>

<p>Here’s a very short Python program
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/ff884dceef7660402fe1eca697cfbf51">find-git-object.py</a>) that
finds out where any given file is stored in <code>.git/objects</code>.</p>

<pre><code>import hashlib
import sys


def object_path(content):
    header = f&#34;blob {len(content)}\0&#34;
    data = header.encode() + content
    digest = hashlib.sha1(data).hexdigest()
    return f&#34;.git/objects/{digest[:2]}/{digest[2:]}&#34;


with open(sys.argv[1], &#34;rb&#34;) as f:
    print(object_path(f.read()))
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is:</p>

<ul>
<li>read the contents of the file</li>
<li>calculate a header (<code>blob 16673\0</code>) and combine it with the contents</li>
<li>calculate the sha1 sum (<code>e33121a9af82dd99d6d706d037204251d41d54</code> in this case)</li>
<li>translate that sha1 sum into a path (<code>.git/objects/e3/3121a9af82dd99d6d706d037204251d41d54</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>We can run it like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 find-git-object.py content/post/2019-06-28-brag-doc.markdown
.git/objects/8a/e33121a9af82dd99d6d706d037204251d41d54
</code></pre>

<h3 id="jargon-content-addressed-storage">jargon: “content addressed storage”</h3>

<p>The term for this storage strategy (where the filename of an object in the
database is the same as the hash of the file’s contents) is “content addressed
storage”.</p>

<p>One neat thing about content addressed storage is that if I have two files (or
50 files!) with the exact same contents, that doesn’t take up any extra space
in Git’s database – if the hash of the contents is <code>aabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb</code>, they’ll both be stored in <code>.git/objects/aa/bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb</code>.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-those-objects-encoded">how are those objects encoded?</h3>

<p>If I try to look at this file in <code>.git/objects</code>, it gets a bit weird:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat .git/objects/8a/e33121a9af82dd99d6d706d037204251d41d54
x^A&lt;8D&gt;&lt;9B&gt;}s&lt;E3&gt;Ƒ&lt;C6&gt;&lt;EF&gt;o|&lt;8A&gt;^Q&lt;9D&gt;&lt;EC&gt;ju&lt;92&gt;&lt;E8&gt;&lt;DD&gt;\&lt;9C&gt;&lt;9C&gt;*&lt;89&gt;j&lt;FD&gt;^...
</code></pre>

<p>What’s going on? Let’s run <code>file</code> on it:</p>

<pre><code>$ file .git/objects/8a/e33121a9af82dd99d6d706d037204251d41d54
.git/objects/8a/e33121a9af82dd99d6d706d037204251d41d54: zlib compressed data
</code></pre>

<p>It’s just compressed! We can write another little Python program called <code>decompress.py</code> that uses the <code>zlib</code> module to decompress the data:</p>

<pre><code>import zlib
import sys

with open(sys.argv[1], &#34;rb&#34;) as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(zlib.decompress(content).decode())
</code></pre>

<p>Now let’s decompress it:</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 decompress.py .git/objects/8a/e33121a9af82dd99d6d706d037204251d41d54 
blob 16673---
title: &#34;Get your work recognized: write a brag document&#34;
date: 2019-06-28T18:46:02Z
url: /blog/brag-documents/
categories: []
---
... the entire blog post ...
</code></pre>

<p>So this data is encoded in a pretty simple way: there’s this
<code>blob 16673\0</code> thing, and then the full contents of the file.</p>

<h3 id="there-aren-t-any-diffs">there aren’t any diffs</h3>

<p>One thing that surprised me here is the first time I learned it: there aren’t
any diffs here! That file is the 9th version of that blog post, but the version
git stores in the <code>.git/objects</code> is the whole file, not the diff from the
previous version.</p>

<p>Git actually sometimes also does store files as diffs (when you run <code>git gc</code> it
can combine multiple different files into a “packfile” for efficiency), but I
have never needed to think about that in my life so we’re not going to get into
it. Aditya Mukerjee has a great post called <a href="https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/unpacking-git-packfiles">Unpacking Git packfiles</a> about how the format works.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-older-versions-of-the-blog-post">what about older versions of the blog post?</h3>

<p>Now you might be wondering – if there are 8 previous versions of that blog
post (before I fixed some typos), where are they in the <code>.git/objects</code>
directory? How do we find them?</p>

<p>First, let’s find every commit where that file changed with <code>git log</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --oneline  content/post/2019-06-28-brag-doc.markdown
c6d4db2d
423cd76a
7e91d7d0
f105905a
b6d23643
998a46dd
67a26b04
d9999f17
026c0f52
72442b67
</code></pre>

<p>Now let’s pick a previous commit, let’s say <code>026c0f52</code>. Commits are also stored
in <code>.git/objects</code>, and we can try to look at it there. But the commit isn’t
there! <code>ls .git/objects/02/6c*</code> doesn’t have any results! You know how we
mentioned “sometimes git packs objects to save space but we don’t need to worry
about it?“. I guess now is the time that we need to worry about it.</p>

<p>So let’s take care of that.</p>

<h3 id="let-s-unpack-some-objects">let’s unpack some objects</h3>

<p>So we need to unpack the objects from the pack files. I looked it up on Stack
Overflow and apparently you can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ mv .git/objects/pack/pack-adeb3c14576443e593a3161e7e1b202faba73f54.pack .
$ git unpack-objects &lt; pack-adeb3c14576443e593a3161e7e1b202faba73f54.pack
</code></pre>

<p>This is weird repository surgery so it’s a bit alarming but I can always
just clone the repository from Github again if I mess it up, so I wasn’t too
worried.</p>

<p>After unpacking all the object files, we end up with way more objects: about
20000 instead of about 2700. Neat.</p>

<pre><code>find .git/objects/ -type f | wc -l
20138
</code></pre>

<h3 id="back-to-looking-at-a-commit">back to looking at a commit</h3>

<p>Now we can go back to looking at our commit <code>026c0f52</code>. You know how we said
that not everything in <code>.git/objects</code> is a file? Some of them are commits! And
to figure out where the old version of our post
<code>content/post/2019-06-28-brag-doc.markdown</code> is stored, we need to dig pretty
deep into this commit.</p>

<p>The first step is to look at the commit in <code>.git/objects</code>.</p>

<h3 id="commit-step-1-look-at-the-commit">commit step 1: look at the commit</h3>

<p>The commit <code>026c0f52</code> is now in
<code>.git/objects/02/6c0f5208c5ea10608afc9252c4a56c1ac1d7e4</code> after doing some
unpacking and we can look at it like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 decompress.py .git/objects/02/6c0f5208c5ea10608afc9252c4a56c1ac1d7e4
commit 211tree 01832a9109ab738dac78ee4e95024c74b9b71c27

committer Julia Evans &lt;julia@jvns.ca&gt; 1561998673 -0400

brag doc
</code></pre>

<p>We can also get same information with <code>git cat-file -p 026c0f52</code>, which does the same thing but does a better job of formatting the data. (the <code>-p</code> option means “format it nicely please”)</p>

<h3 id="commit-step-2-look-at-the-tree">commit step 2: look at the tree</h3>

<p>This commit has a <strong>tree</strong>. What’s that? Well let’s take a look. The tree’s ID
is <code>01832a9109ab738dac78ee4e95024c74b9b71c27</code>, and we can use our
<code>decompress.py</code> script from earlier to look at that git object. (though I had to remove the <code>.decode()</code> to get the script to not crash)</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 decompress.py .git/objects/01/832a9109ab738dac78ee4e95024c74b9b71c27
b&#39;tree 396\x00100644 .gitignore\x00\xc3\xf7`$8\x9b\x8dO\x19/\x18\xb7}|\xc7\xce\x8e:h\xad100644 README.md\x00~\xba\xec\xb3\x11\xa0^\x1c\xa9\xa4?\x1e\xb9\x0f\x1cfG\x96\x0b
</code></pre>

<p>This is formatted in kind of an unreadable way. The main display issue here is that
the commit hashes  (<code>\xc3\xf7$8\x9b\x8dO\x19/\x18\xb7}|\xc7\xce\</code>…) are raw
bytes instead of being encoded in hexadecimal. So we see <code>\xc3\xf7$8\x9b\x8d</code>
instead of <code>c3f76024389b8d</code>. Let’s switch over to using <code>git cat-file -p</code> which
formats the data in a friendlier way, because I don’t feel like writing a
parser for that.</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file -p 01832a9109ab738dac78ee4e95024c74b9b71c27

<p>This is showing us all of the files I had in the root directory of the
repository as of that commit. Looks like I accidentally committed some file
called <code>mystery.rb</code> at some point which I later removed.</p>

<p>Our file is in the <code>content</code> directory, so let’s look at that tree: <code>61ad34108a327a163cdd66fa1a86342dcef4518e</code></p>

</code></pre>

<p>Here the <code>2019-06-28-brag-doc.markdown</code> is the last file listed because it was
the most recent blog post when it was published.</p>

<h3 id="commit-step-5-we-made-it">commit step 5: we made it!</h3>

<p>Finally we have found the object file where a previous version of my blog post
lives! Hooray! It has the hash <code>3105bdd067f7db16436d2ea85463755c8a772046</code>, so
it’s in  <code>git/objects/31/05bdd067f7db16436d2ea85463755c8a772046</code>.</p>

<p>We can look at it with <code>decompress.py</code></p>

<pre><code>$ python3 decompress.py .git/objects/31/05bdd067f7db16436d2ea85463755c8a772046 | head

... rest of the contents of the file here ...
</code></pre>

<p>This is the old version of the post! If I ran <code>git checkout 026c0f52 content/post/2019-06-28-brag-doc.markdown</code> or <code>git restore --source 026c0f52 content/post/2019-06-28-brag-doc.markdown</code>, that’s what I’d get.</p>

<h3 id="this-tree-traversal-is-how-git-log-works">this tree traversal is how <code>git log</code> works</h3>

<p>This whole process we just went through (find the commit, go through the
various directory trees, search for the filename we wanted) seems kind of long
and complicated but this is actually what’s happening behind the scenes when we
run <code>git log content/post/2019-06-28-brag-doc.markdown</code>. It needs to go through
every single commit in your history, check the version (for example
<code>3105bdd067f7db16436d2ea85463755c8a772046</code> in this case) of
<code>content/post/2019-06-28-brag-doc.markdown</code>, and see if it changed from the previous commit.</p>

<p>That’s why <code>git log FILENAME</code> is a little slow sometimes – I have 3000 commits in this
repository and it needs to do a bunch of work for every single commit to figure
out if the file changed in that commit or not.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-previous-versions-of-files-do-i-have">how many previous versions of files do I have?</h3>

<p>Right now I have 1530 files tracked in my blog repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git ls-files | wc -l
1530
</code></pre>

<p>But how many historical files are there? We can list everything in <code>.git/objects</code> to see how many object files there are:</p>

<pre><code>$ find .git/objects/ -type f | grep -v pack | awk -F/ &#39;{print $3 $4}&#39; | wc -l
20135
</code></pre>

<p>Not all of these represent previous versions of files though – as we saw
before, lots of them are commits and directory trees. But we can write another little Python
script called <code>find-blobs.py</code> that goes through all of the objects and checks
if it starts with <code>blob</code> or not:</p>

<pre><code>import zlib
import sys

for line in sys.stdin:
    line = line.strip()
    filename = f&#34;.git/objects/{line[0:2]}/{line[2:]}&#34;
    with open(filename, &#34;rb&#34;) as f:
        contents = zlib.decompress(f.read())
        if contents.startswith(b&#34;blob&#34;):
            print(line)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ find .git/objects/ -type f | grep -v pack | awk -F/ &#39;{print $3 $4}&#39; | python3 find-blobs.py | wc -l
6713
</code></pre>

<p>So it looks like there are <code>6713 - 1530 = 5183</code> old versions of files lying
around in my git repository that git is keeping around for me in case I ever
want to get them back. How nice!</p>

<h3 id="that-s-all">that’s all!</h3>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/ff884dceef7660402fe1eca697cfbf51">Here’s the gist</a> with all
the code for this post. There’s not very much.</p>

<p>I thought I already knew how git worked, but I’d never really thought about
pack files before so this was a fun exploration. I also don’t spend too much
time thinking about how much work <code>git log</code> is actually doing when I ask it to
track the history of a file, so that was fun to dig into.</p>

<p>As a funny postscript: as soon as I committed this blog post, git got mad about
how many objects I had in my repository (I guess 20,000 is too many!) and
ran <code>git gc</code> to compress them all into packfiles. So now my <code>.git/objects</code>
directory is very small:</p>

<pre><code>$ find .git/objects/ -type f | wc -l
14
</code></pre>
