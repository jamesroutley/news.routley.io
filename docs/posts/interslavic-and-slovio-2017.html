<title>Interslavic – FAQ</title>






<h2><i>Često postavjane pytanja</i></h2>



<a name="howto"></a><h2>How to learn and use Interslavic?</h2>

<p>This depends very much on what your needs are, and also on whether you are a Slav yourself. If you want to write a text in Interslavic, there is no need to really learn it. All you need is the grammar and the dictionary. Don&#39;t be afraid that the result will be bad, because there is no such thing as <em>bad Interslavic</em>: remember that Interslavic is not a hermetic language, but rather a set of recommendations you can follow at will. If you try to follow them, the result will in all likeliness be better than if you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>When it comes to speaking, one has always to remember that communication is not just a matter of language. The non-verbal part is equally important. When you try to use Interslavic in a conversation, always make sure that the person you are talking to actually understands you. Speak slowly, keep eye-contact, articulate well, and always be a good listener.</p>

<a name="allslavs"></a><h2>Is it true that all Slavs can understand Interslavic?</h2>

<p>The short anser is: no. There is a lot of Pan-Slavic vocabulary, but if all Slavic languages used the same words, there would be no need for a separate Interslavic language. All we have done is selecting words that are understandable to the largest number of Slavic nations. Inevitably, some words are more geared towards East or West, North or South. If a writer consistently uses words that are best understood by one particular half of the Slavic population, this will automatically lead to better results in this particular half and worse results in the other.</p>

<p>All we can say with certainty is that a vast majority of those who have commented on Interslavic or participated in our research projects can understand texts in written or spoken Interslavic reasonably well. There are no huge differences in intelligibility between speakers of different Slavic languages, except that Czechs and Slovaks score a bit higher and South Slavs a bit lower than average. What we do know, however, is that there is correlation between people&#39;s capability to understand Interslavic and their level of education.

<a name="characters"></a></p><h2>What are those weird diacritics and letters some people use in Interslavic?</h2>

<p>The Interslavic Latin alphabet has four letters with a diacritic: <b>Č</b>, <b>Š</b> and <b>Ž</b> (used in all Slavic orthographies except Polish) as well as <b>Ě</b> (used in Czech and Sorbian, representing a „ye” sound). However, in some texts, but also in the dictionary, you may encounter letters like <b>Å</b>, <b>Đ</b>, <b>Ȯ</b>, <b>Ŕ</b> and <b>Ų</b>. These letters are optional extensions of the standard alphabet that belong to the <a href="https://notebook.wesleyac.com/indieweb-request/orthography.html#etymological_alphabet">Interslavic etymological alphabet</a>. They convey additional information about etymology and pronunciation. For those whose languages have a richer phonology (like Russian and Polish), they make it easier to link Interslavic words to words in their own language. Others can simply ignore the diacritics (exceptions: <b>Ć</b> and <b>Đ</b> should be read as <b>Č</b> and <b>DŽ</b>).</p>

<a name="keyboard"></a><h2>How can I write Interslavic on my own keyboard?</h2>

<p>There are several solutions for this. Standard Interslavic can be written on a Czech keyboard, simplified Interslavic (i.e. without <b>Ě</b> and <b>Y</b>) also on a Croatian, Serbian or Slovenian keyboard. On Windows the letter <b>Ě</b> is available on the latter three as well: just press &lt;<tt>Alt-2</tt>&gt;, followed by <b>E/e</b>.</p>
<p>Other possibilities:
</p><ul>
<li>If you use Windows, see <a href="http://tyflonet.com/siciliano/klaviatury/">http://tyflonet.com/siciliano/klaviatury/</a>.</li>
<li>Android has a solution called GBoard. There, the international Latin alphabet contains all letters used in standard and etymological Interslavic, with the exception of <b>Ȯ</b>, which can be found on the Livonian keyboard definition. Interslavic Cyrillic can be written with the keyboard definition for Church Slavonic (in that case, write <b>ЛЬ</b> and <b>НЬ</b> instead of <b>Љ</b> and <b>Њ</b>).</li>
<li>For Cyrillic, you can also use Multiling O Keyboard, with one of the following definitions. Once you install it on your phone, open the links and click the Apply button. These keyboard definitions contain all Cyrillic letters from the modern Slavic languages and all levels of Interslavic Cyrillic:
<ul>
<li>ЈЦУКЕН (for East Slavs): <a href="https://bit.ly/2NSMxdC">https://bit.ly/2NSMxdC</a>
</li><li>ЉЊЕРТЗ (for Serbs and Macedonians): <a href="https://bit.ly/37frqto">https://bit.ly/37frqto</a>
</li><li>ЯВЕРТЪ (for Bulgarians): <a href="https://bit.ly/2XwwTbb">https://bit.ly/2XwwTbb</a>
</li><li>ѢЬЕРТЫ (for those using a keyboard similar to QWERTY): <a href="https://bit.ly/2prMdcr">https://bit.ly/2prMdcr</a></li>
</ul>
</li><li>Linux has many diacritics for Latin keyboards with the Compose Key. The Mac system has a few international keyboard definitions where you can find them, too (f.ex. ABC Extended). The letters from Interslavic Cyrillic can also be found in Russian and other keyboard definitions with letters from other Cyrillic orthographies (for example, Mac has standard and phonetic Russian, Belarussian and Ukrainian).</li>
<li>On iOS you can use the Czech keyboard definition. To write etymological Interslavic, you will have to switch between Czech, Croatian (for <b>Đ</b>) and Lithuanian (for <b>Ų</b>); you probably won&#39;t find the letter <b>Ȯ</b>, but you can use <b>Ò</b> instead or omit it altogether. If you don&#39;t want to switch between keyboard definitions for writing Cyrillic, you can use the Ukrainian keyboard, as follows: <b>І</b> instead of <b>Ј</b>, <b>ЛЬ</b> and <b>НЬ</b> instead of <b>Љ</b> and <b>Њ</b>, and <b>Ы</b> will appear if you keep pushing <b>І</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find all this too complicated, it is of course possible to substitute problematic letters with letters available on you own keyboard, too. For example, Poles can write <b>CZ</b> instead of <b>Č</b>, East Slavs and Bulgarians can write <b>Й</b> instead of <b>J</b>, etc. For details, see <a href="https://notebook.wesleyac.com/indieweb-request/orthography.html#representation">representation of problematic characters</a>. Remember that such variants might have a negative impact on intelligibility.</p>

<a name="word"></a><h2>Help! I can&#39;t find a word!</h2>

<p>Interslavic is an ongoing project and it is quite possible that you won&#39;t find a word you are looking for in the dictionary. If that is the case, looking for synonyms first. If that doesn&#39;t work either, this is what you can do:
</p><ul>
<li>Check a few Slavic dictionaries, especially Russian, Polish, Czech and Serbo-Croatian, and look for results that are similar in multiple languages. You can find a list of online dictionaries <a href="https://notebook.wesleyac.com/indieweb-request/slovniky.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>If that&#39;s too much work, just use the Russian word, or alternatively, the word in your own Slavic language.</li>
<li>There is a special Facebook group where you can ask for words, propose new words or suggest changes: <a href="http://facebook.com/groups/1933305396885265">Interslavic Assembly</a>.</li>
</ul>


<a name="english"></a><h2>Interslavic and English</h2>

<p>One recurring argument in discussions about Interslavic and artificial languages in general is this: <b>why would anyone learn it, since we already have English as a world language?</b></p>

<a name="russian"></a><h2>Interslavic and Russian</h2>

<p>It has been argued by some that it is a shame if Slavs use English to communicate with other Slavs. <b>Wouldn&#39;t Russian, the mother tongue of almost half of the Slavs and understood by almost half the other half, be a natural lingua franca for Slavic people?</b></p>

<p><b>So how about a Simplified Russian, then?</b></p>

<a name="esperanto"></a><h2>Interslavic and Esperanto</h2>

<p>Another frequently heard point is this: <b>we have Esperanto, so what&#39;s the point of yet another artificial language?</b></p>

<a name="slovio"></a><h2>Interslavic and Slovio</h2>

<p>Before Interslavic was (re)started in 2006 under the name „Slovianski”, there had been dozens of other Slavic-based language projects. By then, the older ones were obsolete and forgotten, while the more recent ones were underdeveloped one-man projects – with one notorious exception: <b>Slovio</b>, a fairly well-known project with a complete grammar and a large dictionary. Some have asked: <b>why start a new project if there is already one such language around?</b></p>

<a name="common_slavic"></a><h2>Interslavic and Proto-Slavic/Old Church Slavonic</h2>

<p>Proto-Slavic exists only as a scientific extrapolation, but Old Church Slavonic and its various regional offshoots constitute a well-attested language – very similar to Proto-Slavic – that has been used as a written language for Slavs of different nationalities up to the 16th century. It has been argued that this would still make it an excellent candidate for a neutral Slavic umbrella language.</p>
