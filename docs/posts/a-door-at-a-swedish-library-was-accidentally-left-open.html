<p>When Anna Carin Elf arrived at her workplace in Gothenburg, she immediately realized something was not right. She works at a library, and she was greeted by several visitors, just like any other day. But this was not any other day — the library was supposed to be closed.</p>



<p>“They were surprised. They thought it was a bit empty,” <a href="https://www.dn.se/sverige/biblioteket-var-stangt-lanade-bocker-anda/">she says</a>. “The people in the library behaved as usual. Many were sitting reading newspapers, some families were in the children’s section and others were searching for books on the computer.”</p>




<p>The library was supposed to be closed for All Saints Day — a celebration sometimes also called <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/culture/culture-society/a-short-history-of-halloween/">All Hallows Day, the precursor of Halloween</a>. But the library staff had forgotten to close a door. So people came in, thinking the library was open. Some visitors <a href="https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/arvid-var-en-av-hundratals-inne-p%C3%A5-ol%C3%A5sta-biblioteket-1.114743762">realized the library</a> was technically closed and went home, but others did not.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent -->
 





<p>As people were coming in and out of the library, one librarian (Elf) walked by and noticed the people using the library. She realized what was happening, called her manager and a colleague, and then announced that the library was closing. The visitors calmly folded their books closed and left. </p>



<p>But some left with books.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent_3 -->




<p>During that day, 446 people visited the city library. A total of 246 books were borrowed. To date, all the books have been returned.</p>



<p>Through a door mistakenly left ajar, the people of Gothenburg demonstrated the power of community and the value they place on the guardianship of shared resources. It was a quiet revolution, an act of civil responsibility that spoke volumes, reaffirming the notion that a library is much more than a building; it is a cornerstone of community, education, and trust.</p>



<p>The City Library published a loving post, thanking people for their well-behaved visits. “Thank you for Saturday, dear Gothenburg,” the library’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/859585461/gothenburg-public-library/">post read</a>.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent -->








<p>“It felt good that everyone behaved exactly as usual, they borrowed books, read the newspaper and so on… the citizens of Gothenburg take care of their library. There is obviously a desire to be there,” said one of the library’s visitors, Arvid Jadenius, <a href="https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/arvid-var-en-av-hundratals-inne-p%C3%A5-ol%C3%A5sta-biblioteket-1.114743762">for a local publisher</a>.</p>



<p>In a world often marred by headlines of chaos and discord, the story of Gothenburg’s library stands as a testament to the inherent good in society — and shows that libraries truly are one of the beacons of our society. It seems almost poetic that on All Saints Day, a day of remembrance and reverence, the citizens of Gothenburg would unknowingly participate in an act of collective respect and honor for their beloved library.</p>
