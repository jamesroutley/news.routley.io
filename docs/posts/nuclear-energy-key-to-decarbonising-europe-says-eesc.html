The Committee calls on the European Commission to include key regulatory and financial enablers in order to make the planned investment possible, and to enhance transparent dialogue with civil society.</strong></p><p>Nuclear energy plays and will continue to play a crucial role in decarbonising the European Union, says the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) in an <a href="https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/our-work/opinions-information-reports/opinions/nuclear-illustrative-programme-1">opinion</a> adopted at the December plenary session. This is particularly true given the fact that the EU needs to consolidate its strategic autonomy in the fields of energy and technology.</p><p>The EESC opinion, drawn up by rapporteur <strong>Dumitru Fornea</strong> and co-rapporteur <strong>Alena Mastantuono</strong>, assesses the European Commission’s 8th <em>Nuclear Illustrative Programme</em> (PINC), published in June 2025.</p><p>According to the Committee, nuclear energy is a key element in diversifying the EU’s energy supply because it delivers safe, reliable, low-carbon electricity. This ensures that the grid remains stable most of the time, regardless of the weather or time of day, with less pressure on systemic costs.</p><p>Nuclear energy can therefore play an important role in supporting the EU’s overall industrial transition as it bolsters resilience against supply disruptions while complementing renewables and reducing dependence on imported fuels. Against this backdrop, existing EU industries (such as steel, cement and chemicals) as well as new industries (data centres) can enjoy a constant stream of decarbonised electricity.</p><p>‘The European nuclear industry sustains more than 1.1 million jobs in the EU and is a significant economic sector with a major footprint in terms of jobs, supply chain capacity and advanced R&amp;D. It is a net-zero value chain based almost entirely in the EU,’ said <strong>Mr Fornea</strong>. ‘If we want to effectively move away from coal, we need accessible clean energy and funding for nuclear.’</p><h2><strong>Moving ahead with planned investment</strong></h2><p>In the opinion, the EESC regrets that the PINC does not propose any specific enablers, nor a real action plan, for the planned investment and urges the European Commission to include regulatory and financial measures. The goal is to enable investment in the sector, promote the development of innovative fuel cycle facilities and propose specific figures on the investment required by the nuclear fuel cycle.</p><p>‘We call on the Commission to put forward concrete measures to make the investment planned under the PINC possible,’ said <strong>Ms Mastantuono</strong>. ‘This is more necessary than ever given the geopolitical turmoil which is forcing the Union to develop EU-based capacities. For this reason, the nuclear value chain should be supported in terms of skills, research and the fuel supply chain.’</p><p>More specifically, the Committee recommends speeding up investment through specific measures such as a streamlined State aid process, access to EU cohesion funds, sustainable financing, licensing processes and faster decisions at EU and national level.</p><p>In addition, the EESC advises applying the same facilities to investment in nuclear energy as for renewables. These two energy sources are complementary and Member States are free to choose their own energy mix.</p><h2><strong>Keeping transparent dialogue open with civil society</strong></h2><p>Dialogue with civil society remains pivotal in building trust, ownership and societal acceptance, and could be more prominently addressed in the PINC. Moreover, there is no dedicated funding available for meaningful civil society participation.</p><p>On this matter, the EESC’s view is that decisions on new projects in the nuclear sector, including the development of new technologies, should be taken following the outcome of a broad and transparent dialogue with civil society on the technical, economic, social and environmental aspects.</p><p>Public engagement is essential to ensure that energy strategies reflect societal priorities (such as sustainability, reliability, land-use and responsibility for long-term waste management) and the early involvement of civil society through dialogue strengthens trust and legitimacy for both nuclear energy and other low-carbon technologies.</p><h2><strong>Background</strong> - <em><strong>Nuclear Illustrative Programme</strong></em><strong> (PINC)</strong></h2><p>According to article 40 of the Euratom Treaty, the European Commission is required to periodically publish a <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/nuclear-energy/nuclear-investment-needs_en"><em>Nuclear Illustrative Programme</em> (PINC)</a> and consult the EESC. The Commission Communication on the PINC issued in June 2025 has therefore been presented under this article for the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee.</p><p>The PINC provides a comprehensive overview of investment needs in nuclear energy, both fission and fusion, and encompasses all stages of the nuclear lifecycle. It also feeds into the debate on the role of nuclear energy in achieving carbon neutrality in the EU by 2050. In line with the highest level of nuclear safety, the PINC supports EU competitiveness, energy security and affordable energy prices.</p><p>In the 8th PINC, the Commission points out that nuclear energy requires significant investment, of around EUR 241 billion until 2050, both for lifetime extensions of existing reactors and the construction of new large-scale reactors. The Commission also says that additional investment is needed for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs) and microreactors and in fusion for the longer-term future.</p></div>
