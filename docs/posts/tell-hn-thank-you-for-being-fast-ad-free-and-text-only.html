    <h1>Tell HN: Thank you for being fast, ad-free and text only</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I’ve been visiting HN for more than a day. Almost daily.</p><p>While Reddit, Digg, FB, Twitter etc have jammed in more features and ads looking like posts, HN has remained high signal to noise ratio.</p><p>Thank you for that.</p><p>As I get older, my brain is unable to deal with ads and too much flashy imagery/videos.</p><p>HN is an oasis.</p><p>My only ask is to revisit CSS a bit and make it mobile friendly. I.e slightly larger fonts and hit areas for expand/collapse. It’s too easy to hit the wrong button on a phone.</p><p>Thank you for keeping HN clean.</p></div></div></div>
