    <h1>‘No way out’: how video games use tricks from gambling to attract big spenders</h1>

There is no such scheme for computer gaming.</p><figure id="3a62f0ed-817b-4790-9e61-7873a7c3a26a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:3,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/14/i-was-not-prepared-for-what-we-came-across-when-treating-gaming-disorders&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;I was not prepared for what we came across when treating gaming disorders&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;3a62f0ed-817b-4790-9e61-7873a7c3a26a&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:0,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:10}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-3 | 3" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>Carrie had begun playing obsessively through the night, spending thousands of pounds in the game and racking up huge debts. She craved dopamine, a chemical released by the brain that exacerbated by her ADHD. Where once she got her dopamine hit from online casinos and fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), she now had mobile gaming.</p><p>“Zynga deliberately uses the same techniques that bookmakers do with slot machines to feed people’s addiction and now I find myself addicted with no way out,” she told the company.</p><p>Zynga agreed to lock her out of her account but, Carrie says, she was able to log back in a couple of days later. She still struggles to rein in her spending.</p><p>Carrie had good reason to compare the seemingly benign world of mobile phone games to the more overtly controversial gambling industry, for the two pastimes are rapidly converging.</p><p>In 2016, the chief executive of the game developer Tribeflame, Torulf Jernstrom, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNjI03CGkb4" data-link-name="in body link">outlined the “tricks” that the mobile games industry, soon projected to be worth $100bn (£76bn) a year, could use</a> to part gamers from their money.</p><p>Addressing a conference in Helsinki, he briefly touched on the morality of this, saying: “We can discuss it, if we have time, later.”</p><p>Examples included exploiting a player’s “hot state”, an impulsive mood created by game dynamics, giving them a time-limited opportunity to spend hard currency to progress.</p><figure id="fe7f40d3-1068-4cc5-b5f8-a948becbd4a8" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.QABlockElement"><gu-island name="QandaAtomWrapper" deferuntil="visible" props="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;4a8bf819-a732-4ace-8bc9-b9f8af4fec72&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;What psychological tricks from gambling do the games industry use?&#34;,&#34;html&#34;:&#34;&lt;p&gt;The mobile gaming industry deploys an array of tactics, some &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/12/what-gambling-firms-dont-want-you-to-know-and-how-they-keep-you-hooked#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAll%20gambling%20games%20are%20based,to%20make%20sense%20of%20things.%E2%80%9D\&#34;&gt;identical or similar to those used by the gambling industry&lt;/a&gt;, to exploit human psychological traits and keep players hooked.
