<p><b>The Cutting Room Floor</b> is a site dedicated to unearthing and researching unused and cut content from video games. From debug menus, to unused music, graphics, enemies, or levels, many games have content never meant to be seen by anybody but the developers — or even meant for everybody, but cut due to time/budget constraints.
</p><p>Feel free to browse our <a href="https://tcrf.net/Category:Games" title="Category:Games">collection of games</a> and start reading. Up for research? Try looking at <a href="https://tcrf.net/Category:Stubs" title="Category:Stubs">some stubs</a> and see if you can help us out. Just have some faint memory of some unused menu/level you saw years ago but can&#39;t remember how to access it? Feel free to start a page with what you saw and we&#39;ll take a look. If you want to help keep this site running and help further research into games, <a href="https://tcrf.net/The_Cutting_Room_Floor:Donate" title="The Cutting Room Floor:Donate">feel free to donate</a>.

<p>Developer: <b>Media Molecule</b></p>

<p><i><a href="https://tcrf.net/LittleBigPlanet_(PlayStation_3)" title="LittleBigPlanet (PlayStation 3)">LittleBigPlanet</a></i> was a revolutionary title when the PlayStation 3 was still new, as it gave players the opportunity to make their own levels and games that could be shared with the rest of the world. The game was so well-received that <i>LittleBigPlanet</i> soon became a full-on franchise, spawning new games and downloadable content for years to come.
</p><p>Apparently, the game went through many stages of development, as evidenced by the abundance of unused content. There are a number of unused materials, stickers, sound effects, models and even remnants of scrapped features, worlds and downloadable content! Not all of it went to waste though, as some of these unused elements would eventually be recycled for future entries and downloadable content.

<p><i><b><a href="https://tcrf.net/Buster_Brothers_(Game_Boy)" title="Buster Brothers (Game Boy)">Buster Brothers</a></b></i>, also known as <i>Pomping World</i>, <i>Pang</i>, and <i>Loony Goony Pop-Balloony</i>, is an action game about popping evil balloons that are terrorizing the landmarks and cities of Earth. 
</p><p>While the Game Boy version is the only one without a two-player mode, the ROM does contain mostly-complete and working Link Cable support, as well as two-player layouts of the screens. That said, it seems this code wasn&#39;t finished: there is neither code to detect the link status nor a special menu item to select the two-player mode.
