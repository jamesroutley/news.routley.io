    <h1>The Cutting Room Floor–unearthing unused and cut content from video games</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div><p>Welcome to The Cutting Room Floor. <a href="https://tcrf.net/Special:Statistics" title="Special:Statistics">26,996</a> articles and <a href="https://tcrf.net/The_Cutting_Room_Floor:Statistics" title="The Cutting Room Floor:Statistics">counting!</a></p>
<p><b>The Cutting Room Floor</b> is a site dedicated to unearthing and researching unused and cut content from video games. From debug menus, to unused music, graphics, enemies, or levels, many games have content never meant to be seen by anybody but the developers — or even meant for everybody, but cut due to time/budget constraints.
</p><p>Feel free to browse our <a href="https://tcrf.net/Category:Games" title="Category:Games">collection of games</a> and start reading. Up for research? Try looking at <a href="https://tcrf.net/Category:Stubs" title="Category:Stubs">some stubs</a> and see if you can help us out. Just have some faint memory of some unused menu/level you saw years ago but can&#39;t remember how to access it? Feel free to start a page with what you saw and we&#39;ll take a look.

<p>Developer: <b>Nintendo</b></p>

<p><i><a href="https://tcrf.net/Super_Mario_Bros._3" title="Super Mario Bros. 3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></i> was the last main-series Mario game released on the NES. The game introduced such beloved concepts as the Koopa Kids, Super Leaves, and Tanooki Suits.
</p><p>Fifteen unused levels are tucked away in the game, only accessible through codes and hacking. Along with those levels are unused enemies, graphics, stage palettes, and two unused minigames. There&#39;s even a debug menu!
</p><p>And in addition to all of that unused content, there are a variety of differences between the Japanese and International versions of the game. The two international revisions contain some interesting differences, too! There&#39;s a lot to know about <i>Super Mario Bros. 3</i>.

<p><i><b><a href="https://tcrf.net/Buster_Brothers_(Game_Boy)" title="Buster Brothers (Game Boy)">Buster Brothers</a></b></i>, also known as <i>Pomping World</i>, <i>Pang</i>, and <i>Loony Goony Pop-Balloony</i>, is an action game about popping evil balloons that are terrorizing the landmarks and cities of Earth. 
</p><p>While the Game Boy version is the only one without a two-player mode, the ROM does contain mostly-complete and working Link Cable support, as well as two-player layouts of the screens. That said, it seems this code wasn&#39;t finished: there is neither code to detect the link status nor a special menu item to select the two-player mode.
