    <h1>The Cutting Room Floor–unearthing unused and cut content from video games</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div><p>Welcome to The Cutting Room Floor. <a href="https://tcrf.net/Special:Statistics" title="Special:Statistics">26,997</a> articles and <a href="https://tcrf.net/The_Cutting_Room_Floor:Statistics" title="The Cutting Room Floor:Statistics">counting!</a></p>
<p><b>The Cutting Room Floor</b> is a site dedicated to unearthing and researching unused and cut content from video games. From debug menus, to unused music, graphics, enemies, or levels, many games have content never meant to be seen by anybody but the developers — or even meant for everybody, but cut due to time/budget constraints.
</p><p>Feel free to browse our <a href="https://tcrf.net/Category:Games" title="Category:Games">collection of games</a> and start reading. Up for research? Try looking at <a href="https://tcrf.net/Category:Stubs" title="Category:Stubs">some stubs</a> and see if you can help us out. Just have some faint memory of some unused menu/level you saw years ago but can&#39;t remember how to access it? Feel free to start a page with what you saw and we&#39;ll take a look.

<p>Developer: <b>Rockstar North</b></p>

<p><i><a href="https://tcrf.net/Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas" title="Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></i>... it&#39;s essentially the pinnacle of the <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> games, if not, many open-world games as a whole. It was loaded with features, such as customization, side missions, a hunger and strength system and even a much bigger map than before. Such content led this game to become a best-seller, to the point of receiving multiple ports.
</p><p>As jam-packed as this game can be, there&#39;s a boatload of unused content to be found such as a wider range of customization options, unseen pedestrians, unused mission parts and even a skateboard. It gets more fascinating as it went through a wealth of revisional and regional differences, resulting in certain details and features being exclusive to a version of the game!

<p><i><b><a href="https://tcrf.net/Buster_Brothers_(Game_Boy)" title="Buster Brothers (Game Boy)">Buster Brothers</a></b></i>, also known as <i>Pomping World</i>, <i>Pang</i>, and <i>Loony Goony Pop-Balloony</i>, is an action game about popping evil balloons that are terrorizing the landmarks and cities of Earth. 
</p><p>While the Game Boy version is the only one without a two-player mode, the ROM does contain mostly-complete and working Link Cable support, as well as two-player layouts of the screens. That said, it seems this code wasn&#39;t finished: there is neither code to detect the link status nor a special menu item to select the two-player mode.
