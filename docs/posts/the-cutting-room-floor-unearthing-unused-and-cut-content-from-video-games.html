<p><b>The Cutting Room Floor</b> is a site dedicated to unearthing and researching unused and cut content from video games. From debug menus, to unused music, graphics, enemies, or levels, many games have content never meant to be seen by anybody but the developers — or even meant for everybody, but cut due to time/budget constraints.
</p><p>Feel free to browse our <a href="https://tcrf.net/Category:Games" title="Category:Games">collection of games</a> and start reading. Up for research? Try looking at <a href="https://tcrf.net/Category:Stubs" title="Category:Stubs">some stubs</a> and see if you can help us out. Just have some faint memory of some unused menu/level you saw years ago but can&#39;t remember how to access it? Feel free to start a page with what you saw and we&#39;ll take a look.

<p>Developer: <b>Rare</b></p>

<p><i>Perfect Dark</i> was a bit of a sleeper hit on the N64. Critically acclaimed, yet the game suffered from poor performance due to being more resource-intensive than what the N64 could provide at the time. Was this the fault of the N64 being less-than-capable, or of the developers not taking into account the limitations of the console they were developing for? Either way, the 2010 re-release on the Xbox 360 solved the resource problems, allowing people to enjoy the game how it was meant to be played.
</p><p>There&#39;s a wealth of unused content though, including models, leftovers from <i><a href="https://tcrf.net/GoldenEye_007_(Nintendo_64)" title="GoldenEye 007 (Nintendo 64)">Goldeneye 007</a></i>, unused music, and unused text.

<p><i><b><a href="https://tcrf.net/Buster_Brothers_(Game_Boy)" title="Buster Brothers (Game Boy)">Buster Brothers</a></b></i>, also known as <i>Pomping World</i>, <i>Pang</i>, and <i>Loony Goony Pop-Balloony</i>, is an action game about popping evil balloons that are terrorizing the landmarks and cities of Earth. 
</p><p>While the Game Boy version is the only one without a two-player mode, the ROM does contain mostly-complete and working Link Cable support, as well as two-player layouts of the screens. That said, it seems this code wasn&#39;t finished: there is neither code to detect the link status nor a special menu item to select the two-player mode.
