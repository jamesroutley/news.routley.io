<p><b>The Cutting Room Floor</b> is a site dedicated to unearthing and researching unused and cut content from video games. From debug menus, to unused music, graphics, enemies, or levels, many games have content never meant to be seen by anybody but the developers — or even meant for everybody, but cut due to time/budget constraints.
</p><p>Feel free to browse our <a href="https://tcrf.net/Category:Games" title="Category:Games">collection of games</a> and start reading. Up for research? Try looking at <a href="https://tcrf.net/Category:Stubs" title="Category:Stubs">some stubs</a> and see if you can help us out. Just have some faint memory of some unused menu/level you saw years ago but can&#39;t remember how to access it? Feel free to start a page with what you saw and we&#39;ll take a look.

<p>Developer: <b>Square</b></p>

<p><i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i> was, for many people, their first strategy RPG ever. Featuring an engaging story, excellent graphics and music, and an <i>incredibly</i> intricate gameplay system, this game is a classic all around. It has quite a bit in common with <i><a href="https://tcrf.net/Tactics_Ogre" title="Tactics Ogre">Tactics Ogre</a></i>, an earlier strategy RPG, mainly because the two games were developed by the same teams.
</p><p>And, of course, it has its fair share of unused content. With unused battle maps, overpowered debug command sets, extra playable characters, fully intact NPC and enemy data left hidden from view, and a whole mess of music left orphaned in the west with the removal of some minigames, <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i> was pretty much <i>the</i> reason to own a <a href="https://tcrf.net/GameShark" title="GameShark">GameShark</a> back in the late 1990s.

<p><i><b><a href="https://tcrf.net/Buster_Brothers_(Game_Boy)" title="Buster Brothers (Game Boy)">Buster Brothers</a></b></i>, also known as <i>Pomping World</i>, <i>Pang</i>, and <i>Loony Goony Pop-Balloony</i>, is an action game about popping evil balloons that are terrorizing the landmarks and cities of Earth. 
</p><p>While the Game Boy version is the only one without a two-player mode, the ROM does contain mostly-complete and working Link Cable support, as well as two-player layouts of the screens. That said, it seems this code wasn&#39;t finished: there is neither code to detect the link status nor a special menu item to select the two-player mode.
