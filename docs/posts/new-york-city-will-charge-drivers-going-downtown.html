      President Joe Biden’s administration is set to allow New York City to move forward with a landmark program that will toll vehicles entering Lower Manhattan, after a public review period ends Monday.

      The toll is formally known as the <a href="https://new.mta.info/project/CBDTP" target="_blank" target="_blank">Central Business District Tolling Program</a> — but it’s commonly called “congestion pricing.”

      In practice it works like any other toll, but because it specifically charges people to drive in the traffic-choked area below 60th street in Manhattan, it would be the first program of its kind in the United States.

      Proposals range from charging vehicles $9 to $23 during peak hours, and it’s set to go into effect next spring.

      The plan had been delayed for years, but it cleared a milestone last month when the Federal Highway Administration signed off on the release of an environmental assessment. The public has until Monday to review the report, and the federal government is widely expected to approve it shortly after.

      New York City is still clawing out of from the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Congestion pricing advocates say it’s a crucial piece of the city’s recovery and a way to re-imagine the city for the future.

      The plan would also mark the culmination of more than a half-century of efforts to implement congestion pricing in New York City. Despite support from several New York City mayors and state governors, car and truck owners in outer boroughs and the suburbs helped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/13/nyregion/cuomo-rethinks-opposition-to-tolls-to-ease-manhattan-traffic.html" target="_blank" target="_blank">defeat proposals</a>.

      In 2007 Mayor Michael Bloomberg called congestion “the elephant in the room” when proposing a toll program, which state lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/nyregion/08congest.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FCongestion%20Pricing&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics®ion=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=53&amp;pgtype=collection" target="_blank" target="_blank">killed</a>.  A decade later, Gov. Andrew Cuomo — who had long resisted congestion pricing — said it was “an idea whose time has come” and declared a subway <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/nyregion/cuomo-declares-a-state-of-emergency-for-the-subway.html" target="_blank" target="_blank">state of emergency</a> after increased delays and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/nyregion/subway-train-derails-in-manhattan.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;pgtype=Article®ion=Footer" target="_blank" target="_blank">derailment</a> that injured dozens. Two years later, the state gave the MTA approval to design a congestion pricing program.

      Ultimately, it was the need to improve New York City’s public transit that became the rallying cry for congestion pricing.

      Each day <a href="https://new.mta.info/project/CBDTP" target="_blank" target="_blank">700,000 cars</a>, taxis and trucks pour into Lower Manhattan, one of the busiest areas in the world with some of the worst gridlock in the United States.

      Car travel at just <a href="https://new.mta.info/document/92756" target="_blank" target="_blank">7.1 mph</a> on average in the congestion price zone, and it’s a downward trend. Public bus speeds have also declined 28% since 2010. New Yorkers lose 117 hours on average each year sitting in traffic, costing them nearly $2,000 in lost productivity and other costs, according to one estimate.

      The toll is designed to reduce the number of vehicles entering the congestion zone by at least 10% every day and slash the number of miles cars travel within the zone by 5%.

      Congestion comes with physical and societal costs, too: more accidents, carbon emissions and pollution happen as belching, honking cars take up space that could be optimized for pedestrians and outdoor dining.

      Proponents also note it will improve public transit, an essential part of New York life. About 75% of trips downtown are via public transit.

      But public-transit ridership is 35% to 45% lower compared to pre-pandemic levels. The MTA says congestion fees will generate a<a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/5/12/23720800/congestion-pricing-new-details" target="_blank" target="_blank"> critical source of revenue</a> to fund $15 billion in future investments to modernize the city’s 100-year-old public transit system.

      New York City is “dependent on public transit,” said Kate Slevin, the executive vice president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban planning and policy group. “We’re relying on that revenue to pay for needed upgrades and investments that ensure reliable, good transit service.”

      “100 years ago we decided the automobile was the way to go, so we narrowed sidewalks and built highways,” said Sam Schwartz, former New York City traffic commissioner and founder of an eponymous consulting firm. “But the future of New York City is that the pedestrian should be king and queen. Everything should be subservient to the pedestrian.”

      Commuters and legislators from New York City’s outer boroughs and New Jersey say the program hurts drivers who have no viable way to reach downtown Manhattan other than by car, and that this would disproportionately impact low-income drivers.
