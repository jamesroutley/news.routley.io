    <h1>Compilers: Incrementally and Extensibly (2024)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><em>Compilers</em> is a practical course. Its goal is to build a real
compiler, which compiles a high-level language down to the actual
x86-64 machine code and produces an executable that runs on student&#39;s
laptops.  The source language is Tiger&#39;: a procedural language
in the spirit of Pascal -- or C with arbitrarily nested functions.
The compiler itself is to be developed in OCaml. 
<p>The other goal of the course is to give a taste of modern software
development, specifically: test-driven development, version control,
and the stress on reading, comprehending and extending code rather
than writing from scratch.
</p><p>The characteristic of the course is an iterative, incremental
development: we start with the most trivial source language, develop
the full compiler for it, and then keep extending the source language
and the compiler in small steps, reusing the earlier work as much as
possible. At each iteration, we build a <em>complete</em> end-to-end
compiler producing runnable and testable executables, for a
(progressively larger) subset of the source language.
</p><p>Another characteristic is the extensive use of tagless-final style,
taking the full advantage of extensibility afforded by
it. The extensibility here means <em>reuse</em> -- of type-checked and
compiled artifacts from the previous increment -- rather than copy-paste.
The compiler is hence structured as a stack of domain-specific
languages, with parsing at the bottom and assembly at the top. The
languages are extended by adding new operations here and there (and
only occasionally by redirection).
</p><p>Yet another feature is the attention given to names, or
`variables&#39;, and associating attributes to them. Our approach, which
readily permits adding attributes at will and analyzing variable usage, may
remind some of algebraic effects.
</p><p>We cover all standard material for the compiler course, from
parsing and type-checking to analyses, 
optimizations, calling conventions and assembly generation -- but in a
quite non-traditional fashion.
</p><p>This course was taught as an elective 15-lecture upper-level 
undergraduate course in the Fall/Winter of 2022 and 2023.</p></div></div>
