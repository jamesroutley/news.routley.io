<p>Emacs can now be built with SQLite, giving native support for reading
and writing to a database. With this, we can start seriously
considering a SQLite-first approach: instead of storing data on the
filesystem, and using various ad-hoc solutions for metadata, we can
use SQLite to store and search our data. This is essentially a
tradeoff between the power and speed of SQLite and the universality of
the filesystem. If we accept that this approach is useful, then a
standard way to store information in database, may be useful and
promote package interoperability, just as our single filesystem does.
The triples packages is a RDF-like database for supplying such a
flexible system for storing and retrieving data from SQLite. A sample
application, ekg, a replacement for org-roam, is shown using this, and
the advantages of the triple design are explained.</p>

<span title="00:00:08.556" data-start="00:00:08.556" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">with Emacs, and to some extent</span>
<span title="00:00:10.540" data-start="00:00:10.540" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">on Emacs for a while. I&#39;ve written the WebSockets library</span>
<span title="00:00:15.273" data-start="00:00:15.273" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and Emacs calc tutorials. I&#39;ve enjoyed use of</span>
<span title="00:00:20.046" data-start="00:00:20.046" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">many of everyone&#39;s incredible packages.</span>
<span title="00:00:24.640" data-start="00:00:24.640" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">So my thesis for this talk, why I&#39;m giving this talk,</span>
<span title="00:00:27.133" data-start="00:00:27.133" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">is that I&#39;m interested in SQLite.</span>
<span title="00:00:29.061" data-start="00:00:29.061" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I think we should be exploring SQLite for applications</span>
<span title="00:00:34.954" data-start="00:00:34.954" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">in ways I think the community has shied away from.</span>
<span title="00:00:37.483" data-start="00:00:37.483" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I&#39;d like to introduce the triples package as a way,</span>
<span title="00:00:41.951" data-start="00:00:41.951" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">both easy and with interesting functionality,</span>
<span title="00:00:47.665" data-start="00:00:47.665" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">that will allow us to build extensible databases</span>
<span title="00:00:49.154" data-start="00:00:49.154" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">in a way that is, I think,</span>
<span title="00:00:52.583" data-start="00:00:52.583" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">a little bit unusual and perhaps compelling, I hope.</span></p>

<p><a href="#mainVideo-sqlite" data-start="00:00:56.220" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">[00:00:56.220]</a> <span data-start="00:00:56.220" title="" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">So first of all, why SQLite?</span>
<span title="00:00:59.227" data-start="00:00:59.227" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Why is this good? Well, SQLite is now built into Emacs.</span>
<span title="00:01:06.080" data-start="00:01:06.080" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">So you get a few things out of this when you use it for data.</span>
<span title="00:01:12.217" data-start="00:01:12.217" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">First of all, it&#39;s a database.</span>
<span title="00:01:14.580" data-start="00:01:14.580" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s extremely good for data, of course.</span>
<span title="00:01:16.370" data-start="00:01:16.370" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">There&#39;s a simplicity to data manipulation</span>
<span title="00:01:19.919" data-start="00:01:19.919" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">using a database, compared to data manipulation,</span>
<span title="00:01:22.028" data-start="00:01:22.028" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">that is, manipulating data in a text file.</span>
<span title="00:01:25.197" data-start="00:01:25.197" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Text files are really not built for data.</span>
<span title="00:01:31.034" data-start="00:01:31.034" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">So when typically when you need to do this,</span>
<span title="00:01:33.140" data-start="00:01:33.140" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">like I know Org Mode is--</span>
<span title="00:01:35.027" data-start="00:01:35.027" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">which I&#39;m a huge, huge Org Mode fan--</span>
<span title="00:01:38.117" data-start="00:01:38.117" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">it&#39;s all about sort of data in text.</span>
<span title="00:01:41.045" data-start="00:01:41.045" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It does work, but you certainly would be</span>
<span title="00:01:45.376" data-start="00:01:45.376" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">hard pressed to make sweeping changes</span>
<span title="00:01:47.360" data-start="00:01:47.360" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">to your database that is represented in text.</span>
<span title="00:01:51.954" data-start="00:01:51.954" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s just not well suited for this sort of thing.</span>
<span title="00:01:53.061" data-start="00:01:53.061" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It would take a long time,</span>
<span title="00:01:54.964" data-start="00:01:54.964" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">where the speed of SQL is incredibly impressive.</span>
<span title="00:02:00.220" data-start="00:02:00.220" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I think certainly Emacs is not known</span>
<span title="00:02:04.430" data-start="00:02:04.430" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">for being extremely speedy.</span>
<span title="00:02:06.753" data-start="00:02:06.753" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I think the overuse of text</span>
<span title="00:02:11.906" data-start="00:02:11.906" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">is part of this. Of course, text and using text,</span>
<span title="00:02:14.614" data-start="00:02:14.614" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">using files has awesome advantages as well.</span>
<span title="00:02:18.468" data-start="00:02:18.468" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I&#39;m really here to talk about</span>
<span title="00:02:20.511" data-start="00:02:20.511" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">the other side of the coin, right?</span>
<span title="00:02:22.718" data-start="00:02:22.718" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Everyone can judge</span>
<span title="00:02:23.962" data-start="00:02:23.962" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">those advantages and disadvantages</span>
<span title="00:02:24.646" data-start="00:02:24.646" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and make their own trade-offs,</span>
<span title="00:02:25.417" data-start="00:02:25.417" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but I want to kind of</span>
<span title="00:02:26.021" data-start="00:02:26.021" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">make the pitch for SQLite.</span></p>

<p><a href="#mainVideo-sqlite" data-start="00:02:29.870" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">[00:02:29.870]</a> <span data-start="00:02:29.870" title="" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">So let&#39;s talk about the triples package.</span>
<span title="00:02:32.860" data-start="00:02:32.860" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">The triples package is a package</span>
<span title="00:02:35.489" data-start="00:02:35.489" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">that is designed to give you a very generic schema.</span>
<span title="00:02:40.420" data-start="00:02:40.420" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">You don&#39;t have to do,</span>
<span title="00:02:42.006" data-start="00:02:42.006" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">for most of the common operations,</span>
<span title="00:02:43.292" data-start="00:02:43.292" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">you don&#39;t have to write SQL yourself.</span>
<span title="00:02:45.517" data-start="00:02:45.517" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">A lot of stuff is built in</span>
<span title="00:02:47.925" data-start="00:02:47.925" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and is based on a very generic schema.</span>
<span title="00:02:51.036" data-start="00:02:51.036" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">That is, it&#39;s a single table.</span>
<span title="00:02:53.840" data-start="00:02:53.840" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">That table has, of course, fixed schema.</span>
<span title="00:02:55.230" data-start="00:02:55.230" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It basically has three columns.</span>
<span title="00:02:57.479" data-start="00:02:57.479" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It actually has four columns.</span>
<span title="00:03:00.868" data-start="00:03:00.868" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">In this talk, I&#39;m not going to get into</span>
<span title="00:03:01.194" data-start="00:03:01.194" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">the fourth column and why, but it&#39;s useful.</span>
<span title="00:03:04.124" data-start="00:03:04.124" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">So the three columns are subject, predicate,</span>
<span title="00:03:07.711" data-start="00:03:07.711" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and object. This is what it&#39;s related to</span>
<span title="00:03:10.362" data-start="00:03:10.362" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">what we call an RDF format.</span>
<span title="00:03:13.909" data-start="00:03:13.909" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">These things basically describe a link.</span>
<span title="00:03:17.140" data-start="00:03:17.140" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">The link is from the subject to the object.</span>
<span title="00:03:20.008" data-start="00:03:20.008" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">The link type is a predicate.</span>
<span title="00:03:23.956" data-start="00:03:23.956" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">That sounds overly theoretical,</span>
<span title="00:03:26.086" data-start="00:03:26.086" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but the point is that you can describe</span>
<span title="00:03:28.033" data-start="00:03:28.033" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">a lot of things with this format.</span>
<span title="00:03:32.006" data-start="00:03:32.006" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">You probably describe everything with it.</span>
<span title="00:03:33.330" data-start="00:03:33.330" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s very simple because the schema is fixed.</span>
<span title="00:03:39.227" data-start="00:03:39.227" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s only this kind of data. That means</span>
<span title="00:03:42.774" data-start="00:03:42.774" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">for your application, you define a schema</span>
<span title="00:03:44.140" data-start="00:03:44.140" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">in subject, predicate, object format.</span>
<span title="00:03:47.327" data-start="00:03:47.327" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">That defines what data you can use,</span>
<span title="00:03:50.073" data-start="00:03:50.073" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">what types there are, what properties they have,</span>
<span title="00:03:56.070" data-start="00:03:56.070" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">how you can use the system,</span>
<span title="00:03:57.215" data-start="00:03:57.215" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and what is legal to do. And this is stored as data.</span>
<span title="00:04:01.007" data-start="00:04:01.007" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I think as Lisp people,</span>
<span title="00:04:03.891" data-start="00:04:03.891" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I think we&#39;re all very onboard</span>
<span title="00:04:07.540" data-start="00:04:07.540" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">with the fact that you have a simple way</span>
<span title="00:04:13.913" data-start="00:04:13.913" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">to express everything, and you don&#39;t have these</span>
<span title="00:04:17.660" data-start="00:04:17.660" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">two systems. In this way,</span>
<span title="00:04:18.925" data-start="00:04:18.925" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">you don&#39;t have to have code as a system.</span>
<span title="00:04:20.872" data-start="00:04:20.872" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Do you have to load code to use the triples package</span>
<span title="00:04:24.826" data-start="00:04:24.826" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">to make sure your schema is obeyed?</span>
<span title="00:04:27.917" data-start="00:04:27.917" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">No, it&#39;s all just built in to this database.</span>
<span title="00:04:35.214" data-start="00:04:35.214" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I&#39;ll describe this. As I said,</span>
<span title="00:04:37.037" data-start="00:04:37.037" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">it&#39;s a little bit abstract right now,</span>
<span title="00:04:39.860" data-start="00:04:39.860" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but it will become a lot clearer</span>
<span title="00:04:42.049" data-start="00:04:42.049" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">when we go through an example,</span>
<span title="00:04:46.779" data-start="00:04:46.779" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">which we&#39;re going to do now.</span></p>

<p><a href="#mainVideo-sqlite" data-start="00:04:50.209" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">[00:04:50.209]</a> <span data-start="00:04:50.209" title="" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">As an exercise, let&#39;s create Emacs bookmarks,</span>
<span title="00:04:56.660" data-start="00:04:56.660" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">which basically are three things:</span>
<span title="00:04:57.346" data-start="00:04:57.346" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">a name, a file, and an annotation.</span>
<span title="00:05:01.039" data-start="00:05:01.039" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I may be missing out on functionality.</span>
<span title="00:05:02.365" data-start="00:05:02.365" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Of course, everything in Emacs,</span>
<span title="00:05:04.773" data-start="00:05:04.773" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">everything has lots and lots of functionality,</span>
<span title="00:05:05.140" data-start="00:05:05.140" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but let&#39;s just start with this simple thing.</span>
<span title="00:05:08.050" data-start="00:05:08.050" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">First of all, we&#39;re going to open up a database.</span>
<span title="00:05:11.100" data-start="00:05:11.100" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Pretty simple.</span>
<span title="00:05:12.104" data-start="00:05:12.104" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I think there&#39;s nothing to explain there.</span>
<span title="00:05:15.015" data-start="00:05:15.015" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">But here on this line that I&#39;m on right now,</span>
<span title="00:05:19.107" data-start="00:05:19.107" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">we are saying, okay, there&#39;s going to be</span>
<span title="00:05:21.433" data-start="00:05:21.433" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">a type called bookmark.</span>
<span title="00:05:24.840" data-start="00:05:24.840" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s going to have the following properties.</span>
<span title="00:05:26.827" data-start="00:05:26.827" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">First, a file, which is unique and a string.</span>
<span title="00:05:29.179" data-start="00:05:29.179" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">The second is an annotation,</span>
<span title="00:05:31.765" data-start="00:05:31.765" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">which is again unique and a string.</span>
<span title="00:05:34.318" data-start="00:05:34.318" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Then we&#39;re going to have another type called named.</span>
<span title="00:05:37.865" data-start="00:05:37.865" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">First of all, why is it named as part of bookmark?</span>
<span title="00:05:39.809" data-start="00:05:39.809" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">As I&#39;ll get into, it&#39;s interesting</span>
<span title="00:05:45.563" data-start="00:05:45.563" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">when you start sharing this database</span>
<span title="00:05:48.512" data-start="00:05:48.512" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">with other things, not just bookmarks, but other types.</span>
<span title="00:05:51.366" data-start="00:05:51.366" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Bookmarks are very similar to many other things</span>
<span title="00:05:54.617" data-start="00:05:54.617" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">that you might want to expand into.</span>
<span title="00:05:56.724" data-start="00:05:56.724" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Those other things have names,</span>
<span title="00:05:57.087" data-start="00:05:57.087" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but they&#39;re not bookmarks.</span>
<span title="00:05:58.270" data-start="00:05:58.270" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s nice to separate these concerns out</span>
<span title="00:06:04.124" data-start="00:06:04.124" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and just have another type called named,</span>
<span title="00:06:08.373" data-start="00:06:08.373" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">which just basically has a name.</span>
<span title="00:06:12.780" data-start="00:06:12.780" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We can execute this.</span>
<span title="00:06:15.747" data-start="00:06:15.747" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s not interesting to look at these.</span>
<span title="00:06:21.440" data-start="00:06:21.440" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">that is not all that useful for anything,</span>
<span title="00:06:21.799" data-start="00:06:21.799" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It outputs something</span>
<span title="00:06:25.908" data-start="00:06:25.908" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but that&#39;s okay. What&#39;s done is, actually,</span>
<span title="00:06:28.015" data-start="00:06:28.015" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">it&#39;s created a database</span>
<span title="00:06:32.263" data-start="00:06:32.263" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and it&#39;s populated it with the schema.</span>
<span title="00:06:34.046" data-start="00:06:34.046" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We can look at this.</span>
<span title="00:06:41.479" data-start="00:06:41.479" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We won&#39;t go through all of this</span>
<span title="00:06:43.603" data-start="00:06:43.603" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">because it&#39;s a little bit too much</span>
<span title="00:06:44.189" data-start="00:06:44.189" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">for a short presentation like this,</span>
<span title="00:06:46.037" data-start="00:06:46.037" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but you could see that there&#39;s something here</span>
<span title="00:06:48.186" data-start="00:06:48.186" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">that&#39;s like, oh, we have a subject bookmark.</span>
<span title="00:06:52.500" data-start="00:06:52.500" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We have a property base/type.</span>
<span title="00:06:56.032" data-start="00:06:56.032" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">That just means that there&#39;s a property</span>
<span title="00:06:58.879" data-start="00:06:58.879" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">that&#39;s defined by the base.</span>
<span title="00:07:00.563" data-start="00:07:00.563" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">This means this is from the triples package itself.</span>
<span title="00:07:02.249" data-start="00:07:02.249" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s not some other package.</span>
<span title="00:07:08.940" data-start="00:07:08.940" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Third is, what is the type of this object?</span>
<span title="00:07:11.526" data-start="00:07:11.526" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s a schema. This thing could be many types.</span>
<span title="00:07:17.060" data-start="00:07:17.060" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">As I said, if you have a--</span>
<span title="00:07:19.151" data-start="00:07:19.151" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">we haven&#39;t seen an example yet,</span>
<span title="00:07:20.236" data-start="00:07:20.236" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but if you have a bookmark,</span>
<span title="00:07:21.100" data-start="00:07:21.100" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">it&#39;s going to have a name type</span>
<span title="00:07:23.687" data-start="00:07:23.687" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and a bookmark type.</span>
<span title="00:07:25.695" data-start="00:07:25.695" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Everything is multi-typed</span>
<span title="00:07:26.720" data-start="00:07:26.720" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and that&#39;s kind of a feature</span>
<span title="00:07:28.147" data-start="00:07:28.147" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">of this kind of storage system.</span>
<span title="00:07:32.138" data-start="00:07:32.138" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I&#39;m not going to go through everything,</span>
<span title="00:07:33.140" data-start="00:07:33.140" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but you can see it&#39;s all there in triples,</span>
<span title="00:07:35.866" data-start="00:07:35.866" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">the whole schema, everything we just did.</span></p>

<span title="00:07:42.646" data-start="00:07:42.646" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">we&#39;re going to connect to our database</span>
<span title="00:07:46.998" data-start="00:07:46.998" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and we&#39;re going to basically set</span>
<span title="00:07:49.247" data-start="00:07:49.247" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">an entire subject.</span>
<span title="00:07:52.553" data-start="00:07:52.553" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">The subject is, it&#39;s basically like an entity.</span>
<span title="00:07:54.240" data-start="00:07:54.240" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We&#39;re going to define a whole entity</span>
<span title="00:07:56.106" data-start="00:07:56.106" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">or you could refer to it as an object.</span>
<span title="00:08:00.677" data-start="00:08:00.677" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">That&#39;s a perfectly fine way to look at it, I think.</span>
<span title="00:08:03.910" data-start="00:08:03.910" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s going to have some identifier.</span>
<span title="00:08:04.357" data-start="00:08:04.357" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">That identifier could be anything.</span>
<span title="00:08:06.724" data-start="00:08:06.724" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It doesn&#39;t have to be a string.</span>
<span title="00:08:07.432" data-start="00:08:07.432" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It could really be anything, but we&#39;re going</span>
<span title="00:08:09.260" data-start="00:08:09.260" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">to give it a string called emacs-init.</span>
<span title="00:08:11.370" data-start="00:08:11.370" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It does not matter what this identifier is,</span>
<span title="00:08:13.299" data-start="00:08:13.299" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">at least for our purposes.</span>
<span title="00:08:17.809" data-start="00:08:17.809" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It does matter when you&#39;re linking to it,</span>
<span title="00:08:19.915" data-start="00:08:19.915" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but I think nothing that I&#39;m about to show you.</span>
<span title="00:08:22.264" data-start="00:08:22.264" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">This could truly be anything</span>
<span title="00:08:25.831" data-start="00:08:25.831" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">because it has a separate name.</span>
<span title="00:08:28.180" data-start="00:08:28.180" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I&#39;m giving it a name here, which is init.</span>
<span title="00:08:32.133" data-start="00:08:32.133" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I&#39;m just specifying the named type here</span>
<span title="00:08:34.918" data-start="00:08:34.918" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and I&#39;m specifying the bookmark type here</span>
<span title="00:08:38.048" data-start="00:08:38.048" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and its values. We&#39;re going to do that.</span>
<span title="00:08:43.220" data-start="00:08:43.220" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Now, if we look, we see everything we saw before,</span>
<span title="00:08:47.770" data-start="00:08:47.770" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but now we have subject emacs-init.</span>
<span title="00:08:52.247" data-start="00:08:52.247" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It has a type and it&#39;s named.</span>
<span title="00:08:55.974" data-start="00:08:55.974" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We also see the same thing two lines down.</span>
<span title="00:08:57.220" data-start="00:08:57.220" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">This type is also a bookmark,</span>
<span title="00:08:58.265" data-start="00:08:58.265" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but the name is init in the named/name,</span>
<span title="00:09:02.820" data-start="00:09:02.820" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">which is like the type is name, named,</span>
<span title="00:09:05.967" data-start="00:09:05.967" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and the property is name. It&#39;s init.</span>
<span title="00:09:08.753" data-start="00:09:08.753" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">As you can see, this is just</span>
<span title="00:09:12.662" data-start="00:09:12.662" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">how everything looks.</span>
<span title="00:09:16.332" data-start="00:09:16.332" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s pretty straightforward</span>
<span title="00:09:18.357" data-start="00:09:18.357" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and you can retrieve it.</span>
<span title="00:09:19.319" data-start="00:09:19.319" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Now, we&#39;re looking at the database,</span>
<span title="00:09:21.604" data-start="00:09:21.604" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but you don&#39;t really have to</span>
<span title="00:09:22.690" data-start="00:09:22.690" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">look at the database for... In fact,</span>
<span title="00:09:23.219" data-start="00:09:23.219" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I think we&#39;re done looking</span>
<span title="00:09:24.223" data-start="00:09:24.223" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">at the triples format,</span>
<span title="00:09:25.106" data-start="00:09:25.106" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">because I think it&#39;s very simple.</span>
<span title="00:09:29.719" data-start="00:09:29.719" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">You&#39;ve already got the hang of it, I think.</span></p>

<span title="00:09:33.070" data-start="00:09:33.070" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">we can retrieve it.</span>
<span title="00:09:37.981" data-start="00:09:37.981" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We&#39;re going to retrieve it and say, okay,</span>
<span title="00:09:38.248" data-start="00:09:38.248" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">what do we get when we load the emacs-init subject?</span>
<span title="00:09:43.287" data-start="00:09:43.287" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Well, we get a plist of all of its properties,</span>
<span title="00:09:48.698" data-start="00:09:48.698" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">which then you can use in your application.</span>
<span title="00:09:55.631" data-start="00:09:55.631" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">There&#39;s many more ways to retrieve</span>
<span title="00:09:57.456" data-start="00:09:57.456" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and there&#39;s many more ways to save.</span>
<span title="00:09:59.380" data-start="00:09:59.380" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">In fact, I think the way I did it here</span>
<span title="00:10:01.905" data-start="00:10:01.905" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">with set subject is probably not</span>
<span title="00:10:04.016" data-start="00:10:04.016" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">the right way to do it most of the time.</span>
<span title="00:10:06.782" data-start="00:10:06.782" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s usually because it&#39;ll erase everything.</span>
<span title="00:10:08.128" data-start="00:10:08.128" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s only really to be used when</span>
<span title="00:10:13.740" data-start="00:10:13.740" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">you&#39;re sure you control all the data,</span>
<span title="00:10:15.711" data-start="00:10:15.711" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but you&#39;re never sure because there could be</span>
<span title="00:10:16.400" data-start="00:10:16.400" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">other packages that are also using this database,</span>
<span title="00:10:19.611" data-start="00:10:19.611" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">they could have their own data.</span>
<span title="00:10:20.696" data-start="00:10:20.696" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">You don&#39;t want to erase</span>
<span title="00:10:21.343" data-start="00:10:21.343" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">all the other Emacs init subject data.</span>
<span title="00:10:25.015" data-start="00:10:25.015" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">In this case, we did because</span>
<span title="00:10:27.700" data-start="00:10:27.700" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">we are confident it was a new entity,</span>
<span title="00:10:30.811" data-start="00:10:30.811" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but in most cases, the right thing to do is</span>
<span title="00:10:31.336" data-start="00:10:31.336" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">just set it by type. Just say,</span>
<span title="00:10:34.290" data-start="00:10:34.290" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">we&#39;re just going to set the bookmark type,</span>
<span title="00:10:36.677" data-start="00:10:36.677" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">which is... The properties are this,</span>
<span title="00:10:37.223" data-start="00:10:37.223" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and then the name type</span>
<span title="00:10:38.105" data-start="00:10:38.105" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and the properties are that.</span>
<span title="00:10:42.815" data-start="00:10:42.815" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">That&#39;s a way that you could do things.</span>
<span title="00:10:44.900" data-start="00:10:44.900" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">There&#39;s also many retrieval types.</span>
<span title="00:10:48.527" data-start="00:10:48.527" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">The retrieval types:</span>
<span title="00:10:53.756" data-start="00:10:53.756" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">you can retrieve by a number of different ways,</span>
<span title="00:10:56.404" data-start="00:10:56.404" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">which I&#39;m not going to get into,</span>

<span title="00:11:15.863" data-start="00:11:15.863" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">There&#39;s another feature of the triples.</span>
<span title="00:11:17.173" data-start="00:11:17.173" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">As I mentioned, these things</span>
<span title="00:11:19.861" data-start="00:11:19.861" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">can be thought about as links,</span>
<span title="00:11:21.850" data-start="00:11:21.850" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but what could be a link in one direction</span>
<span title="00:11:23.798" data-start="00:11:23.798" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">could also be a link in the other direction,</span>
<span title="00:11:25.805" data-start="00:11:25.805" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and we basically get this for free.</span>
<span title="00:11:28.396" data-start="00:11:28.396" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Here&#39;s an example where we are again</span>
<span title="00:11:33.808" data-start="00:11:33.808" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">connecting toward bookmark. Here we&#39;re going to</span>
<span title="00:11:35.753" data-start="00:11:35.753" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">add a new type called tagged.</span>
<span title="00:11:38.224" data-start="00:11:38.224" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We&#39;re going to give everything in tags.</span>
<span title="00:11:41.614" data-start="00:11:41.614" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Here we&#39;re saying, okay, there&#39;s a type called tagged</span>
<span title="00:11:45.525" data-start="00:11:45.525" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and it has a property called tags.</span>
<span title="00:11:49.235" data-start="00:11:49.235" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">This is not unique, so it&#39;s a list basically.</span>
<span title="00:11:52.060" data-start="00:11:52.060" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s a list of string.</span>
<span title="00:11:54.327" data-start="00:11:54.327" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">There also is a type called tag.</span>
<span title="00:11:58.676" data-start="00:11:58.676" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">This is for things that are tags themselves.</span>
<span title="00:12:01.403" data-start="00:12:01.403" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Then it has a type called numbers</span>
<span title="00:12:06.128" data-start="00:12:06.128" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and it has what we call a virtual reversed property.</span>
<span title="00:12:18.004" data-start="00:12:18.004" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s virtual because it&#39;s not actually stored.</span>
<span title="00:12:21.076" data-start="00:12:21.076" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We just compute it by reversing</span>
<span title="00:12:23.742" data-start="00:12:23.742" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">the subject and the object.</span>
<span title="00:12:24.307" data-start="00:12:24.307" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">This is on tagged tags. When we query this,</span>
<span title="00:12:29.260" data-start="00:12:29.260" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">we can just say, okay,</span>
<span title="00:12:32.007" data-start="00:12:32.007" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">what are all the subjects</span>
<span title="00:12:33.269" data-start="00:12:33.269" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">that have tagged tags of me, the tag?</span>
<span title="00:12:38.860" data-start="00:12:38.860" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">In fact, let me demonstrate that for you.</span>
<span title="00:12:39.366" data-start="00:12:39.366" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We&#39;re going to set the type on emacs-init.</span>

<span title="00:12:45.071" data-start="00:12:45.071" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">This is the alternate way of setting data</span>
<span title="00:12:47.018" data-start="00:12:47.018" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">that I mentioned.</span>
<span title="00:12:48.740" data-start="00:12:48.740" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">This won&#39;t erase anything else.</span>
<span title="00:12:49.925" data-start="00:12:49.925" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We&#39;re just adding something here.</span>
<span title="00:12:51.753" data-start="00:12:51.753" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We&#39;re adding this type &#34;tagged&#34;</span>
<span title="00:12:54.743" data-start="00:12:54.743" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">to our previous bookmark emacs-init.</span>
<span title="00:12:59.954" data-start="00:12:59.954" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We&#39;re going to add emacs and config</span>
<span title="00:13:01.059" data-start="00:13:01.059" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">as the tags. We&#39;re going to then</span>
<span title="00:13:06.867" data-start="00:13:06.867" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">set emacs as a tag and config as a tag.</span>
<span title="00:13:11.096" data-start="00:13:11.096" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">That just lets us have this virtual property.</span>
<span title="00:13:15.386" data-start="00:13:15.386" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">You have to do something.</span>
<span title="00:13:16.390" data-start="00:13:16.390" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">You can&#39;t get it out of thin air.</span>
<span title="00:13:18.734" data-start="00:13:18.734" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">The design decision we&#39;ve made is:</span>
<span title="00:13:23.427" data-start="00:13:23.427" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">you at least need to tag it</span>
<span title="00:13:25.509" data-start="00:13:25.509" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">before you get the free property.</span>
<span title="00:13:32.660" data-start="00:13:32.660" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">What you should see... Let&#39;s try it out.</span>
<span title="00:13:35.632" data-start="00:13:35.632" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">We got the subject config,</span>
<span title="00:13:36.038" data-start="00:13:36.038" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">which we&#39;ve set no data on.</span>
<span title="00:13:37.262" data-start="00:13:37.262" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">You can tell we&#39;re not sending any data.</span>
<span title="00:13:40.669" data-start="00:13:40.669" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">If I get that subject, the result is that</span>
<span title="00:13:44.821" data-start="00:13:44.821" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">it says its members are emacs-init.</span>
<span title="00:13:46.069" data-start="00:13:46.069" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">That&#39;s what a virtual reverse property.</span>
<span title="00:13:49.879" data-start="00:13:49.879" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">As we tag more things, this just</span>
<span title="00:13:53.607" data-start="00:13:53.607" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">continues to work because it&#39;s just doing</span>

<span title="00:14:04.176" data-start="00:14:04.176" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">you can have extensible entities.</span>
<span title="00:14:07.864" data-start="00:14:07.864" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">That is, it&#39;s possible that someone writes</span>

<span title="00:14:18.055" data-start="00:14:18.055" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but then someone else can come and say,</span>

<span title="00:14:23.591" data-start="00:14:23.591" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">that&#39;s meant to work with this database,</span>
<span title="00:14:25.740" data-start="00:14:25.740" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">just like someone could do what I did here,</span>
<span title="00:14:28.508" data-start="00:14:28.508" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">just to add simple tagging.</span>
<span title="00:14:30.875" data-start="00:14:30.875" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s very easy to do.</span>
<span title="00:14:32.901" data-start="00:14:32.901" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">This stuff is not that easy to do otherwise.</span>
<span title="00:14:35.932" data-start="00:14:35.932" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">To do this in Lisp, I would say it&#39;s a little awkward.</span>
<span title="00:14:38.962" data-start="00:14:38.962" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">With databases, again, it&#39;s not only possible,</span>
<span title="00:14:42.674" data-start="00:14:42.674" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">it&#39;s relatively trivial,</span>
<span title="00:14:43.499" data-start="00:14:43.499" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">especially with this kind of database.</span>
<span title="00:14:49.829" data-start="00:14:49.829" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">The benefit is it&#39;s super easy to work with.</span>
<span title="00:14:53.057" data-start="00:14:53.057" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">With this kind of generic database,</span>
<span title="00:14:56.042" data-start="00:14:56.042" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">the drawback is it&#39;s not all that efficient</span>
<span title="00:15:00.312" data-start="00:15:00.312" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">as a special purpose table</span>
<span title="00:15:04.382" data-start="00:15:04.382" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">that is really built for efficiencies.</span>
<span title="00:15:06.192" data-start="00:15:06.192" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">A lot of times you have to do multiple lookups</span>
<span title="00:15:08.820" data-start="00:15:08.820" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and things like that.</span>
<span title="00:15:09.443" data-start="00:15:09.443" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Again, it&#39;s a trade-off for various things.</span>
<span title="00:15:11.986" data-start="00:15:11.986" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">As you can see, this is like</span>
<span title="00:15:19.901" data-start="00:15:19.901" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">one database for everything.</span>
<span title="00:15:22.067" data-start="00:15:22.067" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">That means that we don&#39;t have to all</span>
<span title="00:15:29.179" data-start="00:15:29.179" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">contribute to one giant database.</span>
<span title="00:15:31.945" data-start="00:15:31.945" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">All the packages that use triples,</span>
<span title="00:15:33.053" data-start="00:15:33.053" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">it doesn&#39;t have to be one database,</span>
<span title="00:15:35.180" data-start="00:15:35.180" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but it&#39;s cool if it does.</span>
<span title="00:15:37.087" data-start="00:15:37.087" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I don&#39;t know what I want to happen</span>

<span title="00:15:41.220" data-start="00:15:41.220" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but I think an interesting property is that</span>
<span title="00:15:43.069" data-start="00:15:43.069" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">this is a way for lots of data to live together</span>
<span title="00:15:45.400" data-start="00:15:45.400" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and build off each other in ways that I think</span>
<span title="00:15:49.607" data-start="00:15:49.607" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">are hard to do with other forms of table layouts</span>

<span title="00:16:43.199" data-start="00:16:43.199" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">All of this is just a thing</span>

<span title="00:16:49.391" data-start="00:16:49.391" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It works. It has tags.</span>
<span title="00:16:56.082" data-start="00:16:56.082" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">You can see not only this tag,</span>
<span title="00:16:59.230" data-start="00:16:59.230" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but all the other tags associated with it</span>
<span title="00:17:01.355" data-start="00:17:01.355" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and their notes.</span>
<span title="00:17:04.860" data-start="00:17:04.860" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s kind of an interesting way to do things.</span>

<span title="00:17:46.283" data-start="00:17:46.283" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I can just add it here. Again, these tags</span>
<span title="00:17:53.655" data-start="00:17:53.655" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">will turn into data, triple data.</span>
<span title="00:17:56.740" data-start="00:17:56.740" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">The text is just a triple date[??] as well,</span>

<span title="00:19:30.426" data-start="00:19:30.426" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">of all these objects.</span>
<span title="00:19:30.660" data-start="00:19:30.660" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Basically, it just gives you a list</span>
<span title="00:19:32.675" data-start="00:19:32.675" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Again, you can think of these things as objects.</span>
<span title="00:19:33.244" data-start="00:19:33.244" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">All the objects of type tag,</span>
<span title="00:19:35.434" data-start="00:19:35.434" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">we&#39;ll just get them all. Super, super simple.</span>
<span title="00:19:37.321" data-start="00:19:37.321" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Triples gives you this functionality</span>
<span title="00:19:39.586" data-start="00:19:39.586" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">out of the box. It&#39;s not that complicated.</span></p>

<p><a href="#mainVideo-sqlite" data-start="00:19:43.780" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">[00:19:43.780]</a> <span data-start="00:19:43.780" title="" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">What I would like to show,</span>
<span title="00:19:45.168" data-start="00:19:45.168" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and that shows my thesis for this whole talk,</span>
<span title="00:19:49.519" data-start="00:19:49.519" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">is this rename tag. Now, think about</span>
<span title="00:19:52.786" data-start="00:19:52.786" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">how you would rename a tag in Org Roam</span>
<span title="00:19:54.151" data-start="00:19:54.151" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">or anything where the tag is part of the files.</span>
<span title="00:20:03.014" data-start="00:20:03.014" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">It&#39;s like how you would re-tag everything</span>
<span title="00:20:05.280" data-start="00:20:05.280" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">in Org Mode. It&#39;s complicated and error-prone</span>
<span title="00:20:09.870" data-start="00:20:09.870" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and slow. This is anything,</span>
<span title="00:20:12.557" data-start="00:20:12.557" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">this is instantaneous and super easy.</span>
<span title="00:20:14.764" data-start="00:20:14.764" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Look, that&#39;s it. There&#39;s not that many places</span>
<span title="00:20:17.256" data-start="00:20:17.256" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">for an error to live here.</span>
<span title="00:20:19.540" data-start="00:20:19.540" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">One thing I would like to point out</span>
<span title="00:20:21.508" data-start="00:20:21.508" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">is that we are doing direct,</span>
<span title="00:20:23.338" data-start="00:20:23.338" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">not everything has to go through</span>
<span title="00:20:24.321" data-start="00:20:24.321" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">the triples package. Maybe it should,</span>
<span title="00:20:28.293" data-start="00:20:28.293" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but the triples package is a fixed format,</span>
<span title="00:20:31.660" data-start="00:20:31.660" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">which is why it&#39;s okay--</span>
<span title="00:20:33.907" data-start="00:20:33.907" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">whether it&#39;s a good idea, I&#39;m not sure,</span>
<span title="00:20:34.070" data-start="00:20:34.070" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">but it&#39;s okay for client packages</span>
<span title="00:20:39.864" data-start="00:20:39.864" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">to just directly manipulate the tables.</span>
<span title="00:20:42.834" data-start="00:20:42.834" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Here, we&#39;re just doing it just to</span>
<span title="00:20:43.938" data-start="00:20:43.938" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">update all the tags</span>
<span title="00:20:45.266" data-start="00:20:45.266" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">and then remove and set types</span>
<span title="00:20:47.892" data-start="00:20:47.892" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">so that the correct thing happens.</span>
<span title="00:20:49.120" data-start="00:20:49.120" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">As you can see, it&#39;s super, super simple.</span></p>

<span title="00:20:55.375" data-start="00:20:55.375" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">the advantages of applications with SQLite.</span>
<span title="00:21:01.527" data-start="00:21:01.527" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Thank you for listening.</span>
<span title="00:21:02.431" data-start="00:21:02.431" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I hope this puts ideas in your minds</span>
<span title="00:21:05.877" data-start="00:21:05.877" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">about taking advantage of this functionality.</span>
<span title="00:21:09.828" data-start="00:21:09.828" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">I hope to see more things</span>
<span title="00:21:11.936" data-start="00:21:11.936" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">using the triples library</span>
<span title="00:21:12.180" data-start="00:21:12.180" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">or otherwise that take advantage of this.</span>
<span title="00:21:16.018" data-start="00:21:16.018" data-video="mainVideo-sqlite">Thank you for your time.</span></p>
