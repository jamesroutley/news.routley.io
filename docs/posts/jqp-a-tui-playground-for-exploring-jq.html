    <p>Pick a natural number greater than 1, then apply the following transformation until 1 is reached:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the number is even, divide it by 2;</li>
  <li>if the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Collatz Conjecture</strong> says that this procedure will <strong>always terminate</strong>, or in other words that it is a <strong><em><a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2022/04/01/total-partial-functions.html">total function</a></em></strong>. This conjecture is widely believed, but it hasn’t been proven. As far as is known for sure, it could be false. <strong>What would a counterexample look like?</strong></p>

<p>Before we can get into that, let’s go over what it means for the conjecutre to be <strong>true</strong>. We have a certain transformation function <em>C</em>. If the conjecture is true, then for any number <em>N</em>, there is a number <em>K</em> such that <em>N</em> reaches 1 after <em>K</em> applications of <em>C</em> (or in symbols: <em>C<sup>K</sup>(N) = 1</em>). For any particular <em>N</em> and <em>K</em>, determining whether or not this obtains is <strong>computable</strong>.</p>

<p>If true, the conjecture could be <strong>provable</strong> or it could be <strong>unprovable</strong>. But for now, let’s assume the conjecture is <strong>false</strong>. There are two possibilities.</p>



<p>There could be a number <em>Y</em> such that after <em>K</em> applications of <em>C</em> we <strong>come back around to <em>Y</em></strong> (in symbols: <em>C<sup>K</sup>(Y) = Y</em>). Such a sequence will never reach 1, and so <em>Y</em> is a Collatz counterexample. Actually, so are <em>C(Y)</em>, <em>C(C(Y))</em>, etc, so we’ll just <strong>identify the cycle with its smallest member</strong>.</p>

<p>Suppose <em>Y</em> is a cycle counterexample. <strong>Are there any other cycle counterexamples?</strong> As far as I know, this isn’t known. There just could be just one cycle, or exactly seventeen, or infinitely many.</p>

<p>Just as it is computable to determine whether <em>C<sup>K</sup>(N) = 1</em>, it is also computable to determine whether <em>C<sup>K</sup>(N) = N</em>. Thus it is <strong>morally equivalent</strong> to the Collatz Conjecture to say that every number either reaches 1 or reaches itself.</p>

<p>I don’t know the details, but it has been proved that there are <strong>no short cycles</strong>.</p>



<p>There could be a number <em>S</em> such that the sequence <em>Q = S, C(S), C(C(S)), …</em> <strong>never reaches 1 and never repeats</strong>. Every element of <em>Q</em> is a Collatz counterexample, so again we’ll identify <em>Q</em> by its earliest element.</p>

<p>As with cycles, the existence of one infinite sequence is not known to imply the <strong>existence or nonexistence</strong> of any other infinite sequences. But whereas cycles are always computable, <strong>an infinite sequence might or might not be computable</strong>.</p>

<p>Suppose <em>S</em> is, in fact, the earliest element of an infinite sequence <em>Q</em>, but this isn’t known. No number of applications of <em>C</em> will terminate. But from the perspective of the verifier, this will be indistinguishable from the case in which the number of applications required to terminate is merely infeasiably large.</p>

<p>An infinite sequence <em>Q</em> is <strong><em>computably definable</em></strong> if there is a formula <em>P</em> such that <em>P(N)</em> is computable and holds if and only if <em>N</em> belongs to <em>Q</em>. Formulas are finite, so there are only <strong>countably many</strong> of them. But there are <strong>uncountably many</strong> infinite sequences, so all but vanishingly few of them are definable. An infinite sequnce Collatz counterexample could be computably definable, in which case the sequence would provaby be a counterexample. But if the sequence is not computably definable, this would be <strong>unprovable</strong>.</p>

<p>The sequences obtained from iterating the Collatz function on various numbers are referred to as <strong><em>hailstone sequences</em></strong> because the values sometimes increase and sometimes decrease (that is, the sequences are not <em>monotonically increasing</em>.). If <em>N</em> is odd, then <em>C(N)</em> is even, and then <em>C(C(N))</em> will be half of <em>C(N)</em>. If <em>C(C(N))</em> is odd, this will happen again, and this odd-even-odd-even pattern could go on for a while. But it can be proved that if there is an infinite sequence counterexample, it cannot follow this pattern forever; there must be infinitely many even-even steps. This result is known as the <strong><em><a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2022/06/07/half-collatz.html">Half-Collatz theorem</a></em></strong>.</p>



<p>Not much is known about the provability of the Collatz Conjecture. If it is true, it could be provable or not; and if it is false, there could be one or more cycles <strong><em>and / or</em></strong> one or more infinite sequences. Apriori there are a variety of circumstances to consider.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to the simpler logical situation of a statement like <strong>Goldbach’s Conjecture</strong>, which says that every even number can be expressed as the sum of two primes. A counterexample would be an even number <em>E</em> that could not be expressed as the sum of two primes. If such a number actually existed, it would be possible (in principle) to verify it: there are only finitely many primes less than <em>E</em>, so it’s just a matter of checking every possible pair of them. Thus if Goldbach’s Conjecture is in fact false, it is <strong>provably false</strong>; in other words, it is <strong>true if independent</strong>.</p>

<p>There are no such guarantees about the Collatz Conjecture because of the possibility of <strong>undefinable infinite sequences</strong>. In that case the conjecture would be <strong>false, but not provably so</strong>.</p>
