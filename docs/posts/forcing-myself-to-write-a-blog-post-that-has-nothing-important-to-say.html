<p>Forcing myself to write a blog post that has nothing important to say</p>

<p>2023-11-14</p>
  


<p>I keep telling myself &#34;I&#39;ll make my first blog post once I have something important to say&#34;. Somehow my definition of &#34;important&#34; seems to be continually moving just out of my reach, and if I hold off another week or two I will have something worth sharing.</p>
<p>So instead of perpetuating this cycle, I&#39;ll try to at least break the ice.</p>
<p>I have nothing important to say right now. Hopefully I&#39;ll have more non-important (and maybe some important) things to share in the future too.</p>
<p>In the future I&#39;d like to share some of my exploration around running Python in the browser via WebAssembly (check out <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">pyodide</a>). What excites me about this is that languages other than javascript can seamlessly run in the browser, no install/configuration required! My hope is that work in this area will enable more people to easily share their work online, especially for those that aren&#39;t familiar with javascript.</p>
<p>In the meantime, follow me on <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@JohnWithAnH">Mastodon</a>. It&#39;s where all the cool kids are these days. Or you can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnnyC1423">Twitter</a> if you are into that type of thing.</p>
