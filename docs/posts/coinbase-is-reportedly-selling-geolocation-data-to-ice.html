In August 2021, Coinbase signed a smaller contract with ICE worth $29,000 to provide the agency with licenses for its analytics software. In April 2021 and May 2020, Coinbase sold licenses – both initially under $50,000 – from Coinbase Tracer to the U.S. Secret Service.</p></div><div><p>Coinbase Tracer, formerly known as Coinbase Analytics, has faced <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/01/angry-bitcoin-fans-delete-coinbase-accounts-to-protest-neutrino-acquisition/">controversy</a> before. The branch of the exchange responsible for the software’s development emerged from Coinbase’s 2019 acquisition of blockchain intelligence firm Neutrino, whose executive team previously worked with a startup that sold spyware to several governments, including Saudi Arabia, known for human rights abuses.</p></div></div><div data-module-name="article-body/newsletter-cta" data-module-version="1"><hr/><p><h6>Sign up for The Node, our daily newsletter bringing you the biggest crypto news and ideas.</h6></p><p><span>By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk product updates, events and marketing and you agree to our <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/terms/">terms of services</a> and<!-- --> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.</span></p></div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/author/cheyenne-ligon/"><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/coindesk/eddf8aa7-da53-47f8-bdf2-90cc26b9c13d.png" alt="CoinDesk - Unknown" loading="lazy"/></p></a></div></div><div><p>Cheyenne Ligon is a CoinDesk news reporter with a focus on crypto regulation and policy.
