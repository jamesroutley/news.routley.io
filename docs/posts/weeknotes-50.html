<li>hey! hope you had a great week!</li>
<li>thinking about relationships + trust and how they cannot be automated and that will be the next post in <a href="https://olu.online/alphabet-superset">alphabet superset</a> at some point this week!</li>
<li>also thinking a lot about my slash page searcher <a href="https://olu.online/ideas">idea</a> and thinking i&#39;ll reach out to people individually for inclusion cos i like the idea of that. it&#39;s bespoke baby!</li>
<li>thinking more about making zines! i don&#39;t know if anyone will be interested in what i make, and still deciding if i want them to be more personal or more informational (it will still always be on technology stuff, sorry), but definitely excited to get this show on the road. releasing a zine was on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEVbY8PNNmL/">my bingo card for this year</a> (apologies for the instagram link!) so very excited to get to it and actually complete something ðŸ˜­</li>
<li>signed up for kagi again and except for when trying to find stuff to buy in the UK it seems much better or at least equivalent to google so happy about that. will update <a href="https://olu.online/no">no, my post about the informal &#34;boycotting&#34;</a>/opting out i&#39;m doing at some point, i have new thoughts.</li>
<li>it&#39;s really weird going through the accumulated detritus of six years of living in one place. just moving home thoughts! probably not that notable to a lot of people, but i haven&#39;t lived that long in one place in my adult life. i&#39;d also have to do some cross-referencing to work out how long i lived in places as a kid, so it feels significant. may you have stability and peace at home in your life, too.</li>
<li>rugs and curtains are expensive and hard to pick.</li>
<li>started <em>reading code dependent: living in the shadow of ai</em> as my library had it, not much to report so far, though i like the writing style.</li>
<li>content warnings for talk of human extinction events and societal collapse, but <a href="https://www.realtimetechpocalypse.com/p/doomers-say-theres-a-20-chance-of">shot</a> and <a href="https://margaretkilljoy.substack.com/p/how-to-live-like-the-world-is-ending">chaser</a> (excuse the substack links). i don&#39;t agree with the conclusions of the first link, but i liked the round up of all the different supposed &#34;threats&#34; that effective altruists and their ilk bring up. always nice when people you respect agree with you, i guess.</li>
<li>people who use rss readers; what is your favourite? are any of them enjoyable to use or they all just serve the purpose of collating your reading, utilitarian style?</li>
<li>i really enjoyed this <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/everything-i-know-about-self-publishing/">guide to self-publishing books</a>, mostly as it confirmed to me i&#39;m never self-publishing anything bigger than a zine lol.</li>
<li>debating adding <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/10/22/slash-office-hours/">office hours</a> to my blog too, as if i don&#39;t have enough projects that i am ignorng already. but chatting with new people is <del>always</del> usually fun?</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been eating ham, eggs and chips, fried chicken burgers, and mushroom, leek and butter bean stroganoff. i&#39;ve been drinking builders tea with oat milk, gaza cola and tap water.</li>
<li>that&#39;s all for now. see you next week?</li>
