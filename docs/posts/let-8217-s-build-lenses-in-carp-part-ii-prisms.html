    <h1>Let&amp;#8217;s Build Lenses in Carp, Part II: Prisms</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>In a sequel to a video from earlier this week on <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Lets_Build_Lenses_in_Carp.html">lenses</a> we’re going to look at how to extend our library to work with prisms, and find out what prisms are in the process.</p>
<p>If you didn’t watch the first session yet, I highly encourage you to do so before diving into this video, because we’re going to build on the library we started there and extend it.</p>
<p>I left my references on the bottom of the page if you want to dig a little deeper—they are the same resources I linked to the last time.</p>

It is not great if you don’t want to read 50 pages about that topic.</li>

It explains why our implementation is theoretically unsound and how to rectify that. It is also more advanced than my screencast.</li>
