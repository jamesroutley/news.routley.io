    <h1>Ask HN: How to do simple heartbeat monitoring?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey there!</p><p>My team is hosting an API that sends open telemetry data to Signoz &amp; manages on-call via PagerDuty. We&#39;ve configured Signoz to hit Pagerduty when there&#39;s a series of 500 errors.</p><p>However, our server went down last night and NO opentel data was sent to Signoz. We weren&#39;t notified that the server went down as there weren&#39;t 500 responses to report. What&#39;s the easiest way to have a cron-like query hit our API and integrate with our existing stack? Is this feasible with our existing vendors? Should I have a serverless function running on a timer that uses Pagerduty&#39;s API? Should I be migrating to another monitoring service?</p><p>Any advice would be appreciated!</p></div></div></div>
