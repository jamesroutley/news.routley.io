But the exact mechanisms that underlie the brain-building effects of HARs are yet to be uncovered, says study co-author Debra Silver, a developmental neurobiologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.</p><p>To build a clearer picture, Silver and her colleagues zoomed in on one HAR, called <i>HARE5</i>, that they discovered a decade ago<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>. In mice, this snippet of DNA is known to boost the expression of the <i>Fzd8</i> gene, one of the big players behind the development and growth of neural cells. The research team compared the effects of <i>HARE5 </i>in mice, chimpanzees and humans. </p><p>When the researchers swapped a human version of <i>HARE5 </i>into living mice in place of the animals’ own version, the animals’ brains grew to be 6.5% larger than in non-engineered mice by the time they were adults. The brain-enhancing booster was most active in neural stem cells called radial glia, which eventually develop into neurons and other brain cells. The human <i>HARE5</i> increased the division and proliferation of the glia, and the cells went on to produce more neurons than they did when under the influence of the mouse version of <i>HARE5</i>.</p><p>It is so far unclear whether mice that grew larger brains got a boost in cognition or memory, Silver says.</p></div></div>
