    <h1>Show HN: The Bitcoin Note – Secure, Self-Custodial Bitcoin Wallets in Cash Form</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>Secure Printing</h2><p>The Bitcoin Note includes printed features typically only reserved for fiat cash. This includes detailed microtext, gold foil and raised intaglio print that you can feel.</p></div><div><h2>Multisig</h2><p>Generate your own key that’s combined with a local encrypted key. We release the decryption key when the note is cut. After expiration only the user key can claim funds.</p></div><div><h2>Resilient</h2><p>Printed on a synthetic paper that can’t easily be ripped or torn like fiat, Bitcoin notes are designed to be durable for years to come. Whether you store them in a safety deposit box or wallet.</p></div><div><h2>Denominated</h2><p>Like fiat cash, the Bitcoin Note is issued in accessible denominations including 1, 2, 5 and 10 mBTC. You don’t need to be an expert to easily count how much Bitcoin you hold.</p></div><div><h2>Key Rotation</h2><p>Anytime you receive a new Bitcoin Note you can rotate the user key. Put it in cold storage and you are the only one who can claim funds after the multisig expires.</p></div><div><h2>Limited First Edition</h2><p>The first release of the Bitcoin Note will only be 2100 packs of low serial number notes. Each pack will include a single note of each denomination.</p></div></div></div>
