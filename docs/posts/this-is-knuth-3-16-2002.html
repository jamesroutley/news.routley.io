<h2>This is Knuth 3:16</h2>

Welcome to Knuth 3:16, a commemoration of one of the great computer
scientists of ancient times, Donald Ervin Knuth.

<!-- This web page is a *PARODY*, a history of Knuth's life as it might be
written in the far future, when 2002 is a year in the very hazy past.
Please don't send me email telling me that Knuth is still alive!

<!-- The picture is of Knute Rockne -->


Knuth was probably born in the twentieth or early twentieth-first 
century.Â  

<!-- Knuth was born on January 10, 1938 -->


He had a primarily academic career, but unfortunately never held a position
at any present-day institution, so many details have been lost.Â 

<!-- Knuth has been at Stanford since 1968 -->


His achievements were many.Â  Some sources credit him with being the
original inventor of the computer, though this cannot be proved with any
accuracy.Â  Certainly he made significant advances in several areas of
computer science and mathematics.

<!-- Need to mention Knuth's obvious ancestor King Knut somewhere! -->

</p><p>

But his accomplishments spanned other fields as well.Â  As we shall
see, he was an artist of typeface and book design.Â  He was also a
leading moralist and wrote commentaries on God and the Bible.Â 

He was an enthusiastic musician, though exactly which was his instrument is
a subject of some dispute (the most likely candidates are the accordion,
jew&#39;s harp, and flugelhorn).Â 

<!-- organ, really:  http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/organ.html -->

And many historians agree that, before becoming a mathematician and
computer scientist, he started life as a college football coach.Â  He
was evidently highly respected in this field and was widely known by his
nickname &#34;Knuth Rockne&#34;.Â  In his declining years he returned
to this nickname as his interest and talents 
<a href="http://www.originalbirdart.com/knuth.htm">went to the birds</a>.

Here we celebrate Knuth using one of his own tricks:Â  We examine the
sixteenth sentence (zero-based, of course) of the third chapter of each of
his surviving books.
