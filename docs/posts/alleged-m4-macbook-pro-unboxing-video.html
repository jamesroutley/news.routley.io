The video was later linked to on social media platform X <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1843042812599972303">by <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot confirm the authenticity of this leak, the box reveals four potential upgrades for what seems to be the base model 14-inch MacBook Pro:<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>25% faster M4 chip:</strong> The box lists this 14-inch MacBook Pro as having an M4 chip with a 10-core CPU, whereas the current model has the M3 chip with an 8-core CPU. An <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/8171874">alleged Geekbench 6 benchmark result</a> shared by the YouTube channel behind this leak suggests that the M4 chip will be up to 25% faster than the M3 chip. Apple already introduced the M4 chip in the iPad Pro in May, and it indeed has up to a 10-core CPU and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/m4-ipad-pro-cpu-benchmark/">up to 25% faster performance</a> compared to the M3 chip.</li><li><strong>16GB of RAM:</strong> It was previously rumored that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/">16GB of RAM could become the minimum</a> for all future Macs, and the alleged packaging indeed suggests that the next 14-inch MacBook Pro would start with 16GB of RAM, unless it is somehow a built-to-order configuration that will be offered on Apple&#39;s online store.</li>
<li><strong>Three Thunderbolt 4 ports:</strong> The box suggests the base 14-inch MacBook Pro will have three Thunderbolt 4 ports, up from two Thunderbolt 3 ports on the current model.</li>
<li><strong>Space Black:</strong> The box suggests that Space Black would become a color option for the base 14-inch MacBook Pro, whereas it is currently exclusive to models configured with the M3 Pro or M3 Max chip.</li>
</ul>
