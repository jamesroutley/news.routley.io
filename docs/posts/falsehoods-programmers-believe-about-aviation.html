				<p>At FlightAware, our software needs to gracefully handle all sorts of weird and wonderful situations. While we as engineers might hope for aviation data to be clean and well-standardized, the real world is messy.</p><p>There are a lot of assumptions one could make when designing data types and schemas for aviation data that turn out to be inaccurate. In the spirit of <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/?ref=flightaware.engineering">Patrick McKenzie’s classic piece on names</a>, here are some false assumptions one might make about aviation. While many of these are simply common misconceptions, some of these assumptions have bitten our customers at various points, and others have caused issues in our own systems over the years.</p><p>Together they are illustrative of the situations that Hyperfeed, our flight tracking engine, is responsible for correctly interpreting in order to provide a clean and consistent data feed for our website, apps, and APIs.</p><ul><li>Flights depart from a gate</li><li>Flights that depart from a gate <a

registration like N12345, B6459, or FHUVL</li><li>A flight identifier like B6459 is unambiguously either a registration (<a

<a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/service/call-sign-similarity-service?ref=flightaware.engineering">is what the pilots and air traffic control are using</a></li><li>Flights don’t use the code of some entirely unrelated airline in their flight identifier</li><li>No flights use the same flight number within a day</li><li>Surely at least no flights use the same flight number at the same time?</li><li>Okay fine, separate flights from the same major passenger airline that depart within a few minutes of each other would not <a

accurate</li><li>Okay, <em>pretty</em> accurate; they wouldn’t indicate that a flight had departed unless it really had</li><li>If they indicate that a flight plan has been cancelled, then that flight definitely isn’t going to operate — it wouldn’t simply be due to someone editing the flight plan</li><li>At least their radar data accurately identifies each aircraft</li><li>Radars with overlapping coverage areas agree on the location of a target they can both see</li><li>If they send us a flight plan with the ICAO identifier of a known airport as the destination, then there must have been some intention of arriving there</li><li>If an aircraft diverts to another destination, it won’t <a

include the correct flight identification</li><li>Transponders are correctly programmed to indicate the aircraft type (helicopter, airplane, balloon, etc)</li><li>You can always determine a aircraft’s registration number from its ADS-B messages</li><li>Transponders are programmed with the correct Mode S address</li><li>All of the transponders on a single aircraft are programmed with the same Mode S address</li><li>Nobody will ever set their flight identification to weird things like NULL</li><li>People will remember to update the transponder when the aircraft’s registration changes</li><li>ADS-B messages are always received exactly as they were transmitted</li><li>No one ever transmits false ADS-B messages</li><li>Transponders never break and rodents never chew through cables</li></ul><hr/><p>Thanks to my colleagues who contributed to or reviewed this collection of falsehoods: Mark Duell, Paul Durandt, Karina Elizondo, Matt Higgins, Thomas Kyanko, Nathan Reed, and
