    <h1>Documentation for the JSON Lines text file format</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="main_content">
          <p>
            This page describes the JSON Lines text format, also called newline-delimited JSON.
            JSON Lines is a convenient format for storing structured data that may be processed
            one record at a time. It works well with unix-style text processing tools and shell
            pipelines. It&#39;s a great format for log files. It&#39;s also a flexible format for passing
            messages between cooperating processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The JSON Lines format has three requirements:
          </p>
          <h3>
            <a name="utf-8-encoding" href="#utf-8-encoding" id="utf-8-encoding"></a>
            1. UTF-8 Encoding
          </h3>
          <p>
            JSON allows encoding Unicode strings with only ASCII escape sequences, however those
            escapes will be hard to read when viewed in a text editor. The author of the JSON Lines
            file may choose to escape characters to work with plain ASCII files.
          </p>
          <p>
            Encodings other than UTF-8 are very unlikely to be valid when decoded as UTF-8 so the chance
            of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake">accidentally misinterpreting characters</a>
            in JSON Lines files is low.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <a name="each-line-is-a-valid-json-value" href="#each-line-is-a-valid-json-value" id="each-line-is-a-valid-json-value"></a>
            2. Each Line is a Valid JSON Value
          </h3>
          <p>
            The most common values will be objects or arrays, but any JSON value is permitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            See <a href="https://json.org/">json.org</a> for more information about JSON values.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <a name="line-separator-is-n" href="#line-separator-is-n" id="line-separator-is-n"></a>
            3. Line Separator is <code>&#39;\n&#39;</code>
          </h3>
          <p>
            This means <code>&#39;\r\n&#39;</code> is also supported because surrounding white space is
            implicitly ignored when parsing JSON values.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last character in the file <em>may</em> be a line separator, and it will be treated
            the same as if there was no line separator present.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <a name="conventions" href="#conventions" id="conventions"></a>
            4. Suggested Conventions
          </h3>
          <p>
            JSON Lines files may be saved with the file extension <code>.jsonl</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stream compressors like <code>gzip</code> or <code>bzip2</code> are recommended for
            saving space, resulting in <code>.jsonl.gz</code> or <code>.jsonl.bz2</code> files.
          </p>
          <p>
            MIME type may be <code>application/jsonl</code>, but this is not yet standardized; any help
            writing the RFC would be greatly appreciated (see <a href="https://github.com/wardi/jsonlines/issues/19">issue</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Text editing programs call the first line of a text file &#34;line 1&#34;. The first value in a
            JSON Lines file should also be called &#34;value 1&#34;.
          </p>
