<p>A striking and extremely rare half female, half male bird has been spotted by a University of Otago zoologist.</p><p><img src="https://www.otago.ac.nz/__data/assets/image/0024/551166/Hamish-Spencer-image-226-wide.jpg" alt="Hamish Spencer image" width="226" height="339"/></p><p>Sesquicentennial Distinguished Professor Hamish Spencer was holidaying in Colombia when an amateur ornithologist John Murillo pointed out a wild Green Honeycreeper with distinct half green, or female, and half blue, male, plumage.</p><p>“Many birdwatchers could go their whole lives and not see a bilateral gynandromorph in any species of bird. The phenomenon is extremely rare in birds, I know of no examples from New Zealand ever.</p><p>“It is very striking, I was very privileged to see it,” Professor Spencer says.</p><p>Photographs of the bird make the discovery even more significant as they are “arguably the best of a wild bilateral gynandromorphic bird of any species ever”.</p><p>A report on the find, only the second recorded example of gynandromorphism in the species in more than 100 years, has just been published in the <em>Journal of Field Ornithology</em>.</p><p>Professor Spencer says gynandromorphs – animals with both male and female characteristics in a species that usually have separate sexes – are important for our understanding of sex determination and sexual behaviour in birds.</p><p>The main groups in which the phenomenon has been recorded include animal species which feature strong sexual dimorphism; most often insects, especially butterflies, crustaceans, spiders, even lizards and rodents.</p><p>“This particular example of bilateral gynandromorphy – male one side and female the other – shows that, as in several other species, either side of the bird can be male or female.</p><p>“The phenomenon arises from an error during female cell division to produce an egg, followed by double-fertilization by two sperm,” he explains.</p><p>He hopes the novel discovery will inspire people to “treasure exceptions” as they always reveal something interesting.</p><p>“Be always on the lookout for oddities – who will find the first New Zealand example of a bilateral gynandromorph in a bird?”</p><h2>Multimedia</h2><p><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/media/DSCN2268_MOV/23739894">Video of a bilaterally gynandromorphic Green Honeycreeper near Manizales, Colombia, 20 May 2022.
