<p>Scientists have achieved fiber-optic data transfer speeds 1.2 million times faster than the average fixed broadband line by tapping into a previously unstable transmission band for the first time.</p><p>The researchers hit a rate of 301 terabits per second (Tbps) — equivalent to transferring 1,800 4K movies over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/20727-internet-history.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/20727-internet-history.html"><u>internet</u></a> in one second. The median fixed broadband speed in the U.S. in comparison, is 242.38 megabits per second (Mbps), according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/united-states#fixed" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/united-states#fixed"><u>Speed Test</u></a>.</p><p>They achieved this breakneck speed by sending <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/50260-infrared-radiation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/50260-infrared-radiation.html"><u>infrared light</u></a> through tubular strands of glass — which is how fiber-optic broadband works generally. But they tapped into a spectral band that has never been used in commercial systems, called &#34;E-band,&#34; using new, custom-built devices.</p><p>The results of the test — which were conducted using the kind of fiber cables already laid in the ground — were published in March by the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET), the scientists said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aston.ac.uk/latest-news/aston-university-researchers-send-data-45-million-times-faster-average-broadband#:~:text=Aston%20University%20researchers%20have%20sent,used%20in%20fibre%20optic%20systems." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.aston.ac.uk/latest-news/aston-university-researchers-send-data-45-million-times-faster-average-broadband#:~:text=Aston%20University%20researchers%20have%20sent,used%20in%20fibre%20optic%20systems."><u>statement</u></a>. The team also presented the research at the European Conference on Optical Communication (ECOC) in Glasgow in October 2023 — but the paper has not been made public.</p><h2 id="a-new-frontier-for-fiber-optic-connections-3">A new frontier for fiber-optic connections</h2><p>All commercial fiber-optic connections beam data through cables in the C-band and L-band portions of infrared in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html"><u>electromagnetic spectrum</u></a> — with the particular infrared region used for internet connections occupying a range of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.tarluz.com/optical-fiber/pros-and-cons-of-fiber-transmission-bands/" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.tarluz.com/optical-fiber/pros-and-cons-of-fiber-transmission-bands/"><u>1,260 to 1,675 nanometers (nm</u></a>).

But the scientists speculated that one day the sheer volume of traffic will result in these two bands being congested — meaning additional transmission bands will be needed to increase capacity.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/communications/project-kuiper-amazons-answer-to-spacexs-starlink-passes-crucial-test" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/technology/communications/project-kuiper-amazons-answer-to-spacexs-starlink-passes-crucial-test"><u><strong>Project Kuiper: Amazon&#39;s answer to Starlink passes &#39;crucial&#39; test</strong></u></a></p><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-YjZt4AkBKXe3Bk9D5pvX4n"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.</p></section></div></div></div><p>S-band, which is adjacent to the C-band and occupies the range 1,460 nm to 1,530 nm, has been commercially used in combination with the other two in a system known as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fiberlabs.com/glossary/wavelength-division-multiplexing/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fiberlabs.com/glossary/wavelength-division-multiplexing/"><u>&#34;wavelength division multiplexing&#34;</u></a> (WDM), in which all three bands are used to reach much higher speeds.</p><p>Scientists have never been able to emulate E-band connections before, however, because the data loss in this region shoots up to extremely high levels — roughly five times the rate of loss of transmission in the C-band and L-band regions.</p><p>Specifically, fiber-optic cables are susceptible to exposure to hydroxyl (OH) molecules that can enter the tubes and disrupt connections, either through manufacturing or naturally in the environment. E-band is called the &#34;water peak&#34; band because extremely high transmission loss is caused by the absorption of OH molecules by infrared light in this region.</p><h2 id="stabilizing-connections-at-the-quot-water-peak-quot-band-3">Stabilizing connections at the &#34;water peak&#34; band</h2><p>In the new research, scientists built a system that made stable E-band transmission possible. They demonstrated successful and stable data transfer at high speeds using both the E-band and the adjacent S-band.</p><p>To maintain a stable connection in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum, the researchers created two new devices called &#34;<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.globalspec.com/reference/21554/160210/chapter-4-4-2-optical-amplifiers-and-regenerators" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.globalspec.com/reference/21554/160210/chapter-4-4-2-optical-amplifiers-and-regenerators"><u>optical amplifiers</u></a>&#34; and &#34;<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.globalspec.com/reference/21556/160210/chapter-4-4-4-optical-gain-equalizers" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.globalspec.com/reference/21556/160210/chapter-4-4-4-optical-gain-equalizers"><u>optical gain equalizers</u></a>.&#34; The former helps to amplify the signal over distances while the latter monitors each wavelength channel and adjusts the amplitude where needed. They deployed them in the fiber-optic cables to ensure the infrared light transmitted data without the instability and loss that normally plagues connections in these bands.</p><p>&#34;Over the last few years Aston University has been developing optical amplifiers that operate in the E-band, which sits adjacent to the C-band in the electromagnetic spectrum but is about three times wider,&#34; said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.aston.ac.uk/en/persons/ian-phillips" target="_blank" data-url="https://research.aston.ac.uk/en/persons/ian-phillips"><u>Ian Phillips</u></a>, professor of electronics and computer engineering at Aston University in the U.K. and one of the scientists working on the project. &#34;Before the development of our device, no one had been able to properly emulate the E-band channels in a controlled way.&#34;</p><p>Although 301 Tbps is extremely fast, other scientists have tapped into fiber-optic connections to demonstrate even faster speeds in recent years. A team at NICT, for example, hit the world record of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nict.go.jp/en/press/2023/11/30-1.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nict.go.jp/en/press/2023/11/30-1.html"><u>22.9 petabits per second</u></a> in November 2023 — 75 times faster than the speed Aston University team achieved. They used WDM technology but did not access E-band wavelengths. They demonstrated this high-speed connection over a distance of 8 miles (13 kilometers).</p>
