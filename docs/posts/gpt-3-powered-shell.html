    <h1>Show HN: GPT-3 Powered Shell</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I was inspired after seeing <a href="https://twitter.com/NaderLikeLadder">@NaderLikeLadder</a>&#39;s post &#34;<a href="https://brev.dev/blog/ai-wont-replace-you-write-bash#ai-works-best-at-enabling-professionals-not-replacing-them">Using ChatGPT to make Bash palatable</a>&#34;. He correctly pointed out that AI is finally the tool we need to win the fight against <code>bash</code> (or <code>fish</code>, or <code>zsh</code>...) once and for all.</p><p>While the interactive scripting experience with ChatGPT is pretty sweet, my qualms normally come from the day-to-day &#34;how do I do that again??&#34;. Whether its rebasing while deferring to local changes, or figuring out which process is locking up my TPU, far too much time is spent diving into <code>man</code> pages.</p><p>Enter: <code>gpt-do</code>! With this handy-dandy command, I never have to grep through docs again. I simply call <code>do whatever I cant to get done</code> in my shell, and the commands magically appear.</p><pre><code>$ do kill the process which is locking up my GPU
This command will kill the process which is locking up your GPU.
kill -9 $(lsof -t /dev/nvidia0)
Do you want to continue? [y/N]: </code></pre><div><p>ðŸ’¡</p><p><strong><code>do</code> is a reserved keyword in <code>bash</code> and <code>zsh</code> so you&#39;ll have to use <code>ddo</code> instead.</strong></p></div><p>Well, maybe not so magically. I figured if ChatGPT could do fully-interactive sessions, GPT-3 should be able to handle one-offs no problem. And it looks like I was right!</p><p>Check out this awesome demo I threw together:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Sometimes, GPT-3 doesn&#39;t quite get it right.</p><pre><code>$ do kill the orphaned python process
These commands will list all processes and kill the orphaned python process.
ps -A | grep python
kill -9 &lt;PID&gt;
Do you want to continue? [y/N]: N
$</code></pre><p>So I added the ability to query a different model:</p><pre><code>$ do kill the orphaned python process --model=codex
This command will kill the orphaned python process.
kill -9 $(ps aux | grep python | grep -v grep | awk &#39;{print $2}&#39;)
Do you want to continue? [y/N]:</code></pre><p>That did it!</p><p>With a little Python magic, you can <code>do</code> too. Just <code>brew install yasyf/do/do</code> (or <code>pipx install gpt-do</code>), and check out the <a href="https://github.com/yasyf/gpt-do">repo</a> for more details. You&#39;ll need a free OpenAI API key, and remember to use <code>ddo</code> if you&#39;re on <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>!</p>
