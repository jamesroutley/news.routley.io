    <h1>Things I Learned from My 2 Year Old Baby Girl</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>Two years ago I gave birth to the most wonderful person on this planet. Every day she brings a huge smile on my face and opens my eyes to so many things I was previously missing. Before she was born I thought it would be my job to teach her everything about the world. As it turns out, there are equally many things that I get to learn now from her.</p><p>Here’s a few things my baby girl taught me so far. I’m sure that as she grows up, there will be even more. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d6974c-fb25-45a7-8bbc-f7bd4d140be5_1498x1000.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d6974c-fb25-45a7-8bbc-f7bd4d140be5_1498x1000.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d6974c-fb25-45a7-8bbc-f7bd4d140be5_1498x1000.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d6974c-fb25-45a7-8bbc-f7bd4d140be5_1498x1000.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d6974c-fb25-45a7-8bbc-f7bd4d140be5_1498x1000.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d6974c-fb25-45a7-8bbc-f7bd4d140be5_1498x1000.png" width="1456" height="972" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/43d6974c-fb25-45a7-8bbc-f7bd4d140be5_1498x1000.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:972,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:2399130,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;the most wonderful baby girl on this planet, and her dog&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="the most wonderful baby girl on this planet, and her dog" title="the most wonderful baby girl on this planet, and her dog" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d6974c-fb25-45a7-8bbc-f7bd4d140be5_1498x1000.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d6974c-fb25-45a7-8bbc-f7bd4d140be5_1498x1000.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d6974c-fb25-45a7-8bbc-f7bd4d140be5_1498x1000.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d6974c-fb25-45a7-8bbc-f7bd4d140be5_1498x1000.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><ol><li><p><strong>There’s no bad weather, only inappropriate clothes.</strong><span> Adults complain about the weather all the time. Luckily, my little girl hasn’t noticed yet that it’s a thing. When it’s raining, she likes to go out and jump around in the puddles. When it’s windy, she’ll take a balloon outside and watch it dance in the wind. I used to hide inside as fast as I could when it was cold or raining. Now I know there are clothes that will let you sit or roll in grass in pretty much any weather.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Whatever you do, do it as a ceremony.</strong><span> Before my daughter was born I used to rush through my everyday chores, trying to complete everything as fast as I could. When we do them together, we do it slowly and fully focused on the task at hand Suddenly, loading the dishwasher, doing laundry, or peeling potatoes can become an occasion to have fun together and even something to look forward to. Yes, it takes us three times longer than it used to, but we’re not in a hurry. There’s nothing else we’d rather be doing anyway.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Every little thing affects you.</strong><span> In the past I haven’t paid much attention to my physical surroundings. I </span><a href="https://madeincosmos.substack.com/p/you-cant-raise-a-baby-online" rel="">lived most of my life online</a><span> anyway. Luckily, my daughter brought me back to the physical world, and helped me notice how the stuff around us affects our mood, energy, and ability to focus on anything. When she has too many toys in her play corner, she’s too overwhelmed to play with any of them. When I arrange her favorite candles in a deliberate manner, she can just sit calmly and watch them for hours.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Hang out by the fire.</strong><span> Speaking about candles, I don’t think I’ve ever burned so many of them before. My daughter has such incredible reverence for the fire, the first time she saw a fireplace she was completely mesmerized. In the past, every house had an open fire that kept the whole family fed and warm. Now that we cook and heat our homes with electric appliances, some very subtle kind of magic is missing. Even a few candles lit up in a room can suddenly make it feel much more alive.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>And other elements too.</strong><span> How often do you usually roll in fresh grass, jump around in a puddle, dig in mud, or climb a tree? I thought I did it more often than most people, and then I had a kid. Even if you consider yourself a nature lover, babies and toddlers will still surprise you with how much they want to engage with the elements. Getting dirty is definitely not going to stop them from doing that.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Pay attention to the sky.</strong><span> If there’s something that ignites more awe and wonder in my daughter than fire, it’s the Moon. Even before she could walk, she’d always point to the Moon whenever it showed up in the sky. These days, she’ll watch for the stars and Moon every day when it gets dark, and even has her own special nicknames for both. The last few months in Warsaw were very cloudy, so if one of them suddenly shines through the clouds, it’s a big occasion to celebrate. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>All animals are wonderful.</strong><span> I remember how we were feeding ducks in park once, and a wild rat appeared out of nowhere. My first reaction was a bit of a shock combined with disgust. But my daughter was so excited to see a rat for the first time, and so enthusiastic to feed him too, that I could no longer have anything against this poor little creature. Rats too are our distant cousins after all.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>The world is alive.</strong><span> Would you sing a song to the Moon? Read books to animals or stuffed toys? Show your tablet to an airplane so that you can watch cartoons together? My daughter does. To her there’s no difference between our rescue dog and her stuffed teddy bear. Both are alive in their own ways, both can be admired and engaged with, both of them deserve her love and attention.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Love and attention is all you need.</strong><span> The biggest surprise since my baby girl was born is how much she loves hanging out with my dad. The feeling is mutual, they just can’t get enough of each other. My dad is a different person now. I never thought he could be so patient and caring, and probably neither did he. He says nobody ever loved him like this little girl does. </span></p></li></ol><p>Happy birthday, my sweetest little nugget! You’re the best teacher I could have ever had.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
