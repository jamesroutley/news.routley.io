<p>What’s even more encouraging is that <strong>over 78% of these downloads came from Windows</strong>. This influx of new users reflects our mission to provide a better alternative to the incumbent PC operating systems from Big Tech.</p>
<p>We would like to take this moment to extend a massive thank you to everyone who has downloaded, shared, and supported our biggest release ever. Your enthusiasm is what drives us to make Zorin OS even better!</p>

<p>We’re also excited to announce that we’re officially launching upgrades from Zorin OS 17 to 18 today.</p>
<p>This upgrade path is in early testing and is currently only available to users of the <strong>Zorin OS 17 Core, Education, and Pro</strong> editions. Upgrading now will allow us to collect feedback and fix bugs to improve the user experience before its full stable launch in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>This upgrade path is designed to allow existing Zorin OS 17 users to upgrade their computers to Zorin OS 18 directly, without needing to re-install the operating system. This means you’ll be able to keep your files, apps, and settings, all while taking advantage of the new features and improvements in Zorin OS 18.</p>
