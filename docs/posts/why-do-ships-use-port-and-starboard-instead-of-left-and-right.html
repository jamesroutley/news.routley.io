    <h1>Why do ships use “port” and “starboard” instead of “left” and “right?”</h1>

				<p>Since port and starboard never change, they are unambiguous references that are independent of a mariner’s orientation, and, thus, mariners use these nautical terms instead of left and right to avoid confusion. When looking forward, toward the <abbr title="front of the boat">bow</abbr> of a ship, port and starboard refer to the left and right sides, respectively. </p>
       
      <p>In the early days of boating, before ships had rudders on their centerlines, boats were controlled using a steering oar. Most sailors were right handed, so the steering oar was placed over or through the right side of the <abbr title="back of the boat">stern</abbr>. Sailors began calling the right side the steering side, which soon became &#34;starboard&#34; by combining two Old English words: <em>stéor</em> (meaning &#34;steer&#34;) and <em>bord</em> (meaning &#34;the side of a boat&#34;).

</p>
      
      <p>As the size of boats grew, so did the steering oar, making it much easier to tie a boat up to a dock on the side opposite the oar. This side became known as larboard, or &#34;the loading side.&#34; Over time, larboard—too easily confused with starboard—was replaced with port. After all, this was the side that faced the port, allowing supplies to be ported aboard by porters.</p>
