    <h1>Native frame transposition coming to Emacs 31</h1>

Around September 2024, I also discovered this useful package for emacs
windows management <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TransposeFrame">transpose-frame.el</a>.
</p>

<p>
Around this time, I read Tobias&#39; great article on <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2020/01/17/doing-things-that-scale/">doing things that

This <a href="https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/ac1735fd-e023-4e01-a3e2-2bd19087594c@gmx.at/">mail</a> goes in more detail about what was wrong with <code>transpose-frame.el</code>
</span>.  The correct approach required new code in emacs
<i>C-land</i> to be able to &#39;necromance&#39; window objects when using the
function <code>split-window</code>.  For this reason, simply changing up the code
in <code>transpose-frame.el</code> would not be suff</p></div></div>
