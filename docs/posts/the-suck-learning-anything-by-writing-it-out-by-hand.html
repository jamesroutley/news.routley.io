    <h1>“The Suck” (Learning Anything by Writing It Out by Hand)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>What I really should be doing right now is chasing down high-resolution versions of thirteen images in my forthcoming book, <em>Antinet Zettelkasten</em>.</p>
<p>You see, my book&#39;s typesetter did a wonderful job of designing the interior of my book (it&#39;s freaking beautiful). However, there are thirteen images that were low-resolution, and they&#39;d look like shit if they were printed. It&#39;s been on my plate all week to find high-resolution versions of these images.</p>
<p>But other things came up during the week, and other important tasks crowded out my time. Things like creating a video presentation for my Neo-Intellectual Institute members, as well as my private coaching of Neo-Intellectuals!</p>
<p>OK, I&#39;ll cut the bullshit. I have no excuse. I really should&#39;ve gotten the high-resolution image stuff done this week, but oh well.</p>
<p>This morning I originally planned to chase down these images, but I decided to spend my morning reading about how learned physicians used notebooks in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to manage their knowledge (Jesus Christ, I&#39;m never going to get this book live!)</p>
<p>Oh well, I&#39;m not going to beat myself up too much. Maybe I&#39;ll get it done right after I finish writing this email.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I&#39;ve decided to do something a little different in this email.</p>
<p>You see, normally I write these emails by the seat of my pants. I aim to have these emails be more along the lines of &#34;infotainment.&#34; Meaning, they aim to contain brief bits of <em>information</em> while also being <em>entertaining</em>. I explicitly try not to &#34;teach&#34; in these emails, nor do I try to share developed knowledge. Sharing developed knowledge is what my upcoming book is for, and it&#39;s also what my course material in my Neo-Intellectual Institute is for.</p>
<p>Plus, you really don&#39;t want to be reading fully-developed knowledge on your small ass phone via email. You may think you do, but you don&#39;t. Plus, research shows &#34;reading comprehension is reduced when reading from an electronic device.&#34;  So there.</p>
<p>Now, with that said, allow me to completely contradict myself…</p>
<p>You see, in this email, I&#39;ve decided to do <em>a little</em> teaching (hopefully in an entertaining way).</p>
<p>What I am going to teach you is something called <em>The Suck</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Suck</em> is a term coined by the late great copywriter Gary Halbert. A copywriter is a form of writing that seeks to <em>inspire</em> someone to take action. Typically this <em>action</em> is in the form of purchasing a product or service. This is why copywriting is mostly synonymous with the practice of writing advertisements or sales pages.</p>
<p>These days, the vast majority of Sapiens is composed of dimwits who don&#39;t read. And thus, advertisements are presented in the form of video (TikTok, YouTube, television commercials, etc.); still, behind the scenes of most effective video advertisements, you can bet your ass that there&#39;s a good copywriter creating a script that inspires one to take action.</p>
<p>OK, now, with that preamble out of the way, we can get back to the matter at hand: &#34;The Suck.&#34;</p>
<p>You see, when the great copywriter Gary Halbert trained people in the art of copywriting, guess what he did?</p>
<p>He would make his students write out the best advertisements and sales pages ever written… by hand!</p>
<p>This practice requires a lot of time and attention, which is why he called it, &#34;The Suck.&#34;</p>
<p>Why did Halbert train his students this way? One reason: because it worked.</p>
<p>When you write out a text, word-for-word by hand, you&#39;re &#34;imprinting&#34; the idea on your memory. Don&#39;t take it from me, take it from Benjamin Franklin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;You should read with a pen in your hand and enter… short hints of what you feel… may be useful; for this be the best method of <em>imprinting</em> them in your memory.&#34; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept of learning something by imprinting it on your mind is something I refer to as <em>neuroimprinting</em>. It&#39;s a concept I talk a lot about in my forthcoming <em>Antinet Zettelkasten</em> book. The phrase is, again, inspired by Gary Halbert who wrote, &#34;I believe in neural imprinting. And writing out in your own handwriting a really excellent piece is the very best way to achieve this imprinting.&#34; </p>
<p>Want to become a great copywriter?</p>
<p>Then write out the best advertisements of all time, word-for-word, by hand.</p>
<p>Want to become a better writer?</p>
<p>Then write out the best book you&#39;ve read, word-for-word, by hand.</p>
<p>There&#39;s several sections in my Antinet where I store my neuroimprints of various texts.</p>
<p>I have over 300 cards of the best advertising headlines of all time.</p>
<p>I taught myself the programming language <em>Python</em> by writing out python scripts by hand.</p>
<p>Recently, I wanted to improve the <em>style</em> of my writing (specifically using colorful language and prose). So what did I do? I began neuroimprinting <em>The Great Gatsby</em>. I&#39;m only fifteen pages in and I&#39;ve already seen growth as a writer in this area.</p>
<p>The concept of learning by <em>neuroimprinting</em> ideas by writing them out by hand is not new.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#39;s really damn old.</p>
<p>The scholar Francesco Sacchini (1570–1625) cites ancients who copied down texts. He explains they did such a practice not in order to have copies of them, but in order to better retain the knowledge.</p>
<p>Demosthenes copied down Thucydides eight times in order to understand the ideas more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Saint Jerome (342–420 AD) wrote many volumes by hand, &#34;not due to the weakness of his library but out of desire to profit from the exercise.&#34; </p>
<p>In ancient times, the practice of writing down passages was a &#34;form of mental training,&#34; <em>notes</em> Alberto Cevolini (pun intended).</p>
<p>The New England preacher Richard Steele wrote in 1682: &#34;The very writing of any thing fixes it deeper in the mind.&#34; </p>
<p>In fact, at Harvard College in the late seventeenth century, students were taught in the following manner. They were given the assignment to write down textbooks bought in England, by hand.</p>
<p>It may sound like a lazy way of teaching; however, there remains a serious argument for the power of teaching students by making them write out knowledge by hand. We have moved away from the practice in modern times, but it&#39;s something that may warrant revisiting.</p>
<p>Anyway, as you head into this weekend, I want you to think about this. Think about something you&#39;ve always aspired to <em>learn</em> (or even something you&#39;ve always aspired <em>to be</em>).</p>
<p>If you want to learn poetry, pick up a great book of poems and write them out by hand.</p>
<p>If you want to write beautiful JavaScript, search Github for the most beautiful repo you can find and begin writing out the files by hand.</p>
<p>You get the point.</p>
<p>Hopefully you enjoyed this piece, and hopefully your eyes didn&#39;t glaze over when I entered &#34;teaching mode&#34; (and began pulling out references and quotes out of my ass to support my point).</p>
<p>Actually, I didn&#39;t pull the references and quotes out of my ass. Rather, I pulled them out of my Antinet and from my book. At the end of this email is a picture of the cards I used to write this piece).</p>
<p>I hope this idea inspires you to neuroimprint something soon.</p>
<p>Godspeed, and good luck neuroimprinting ideas on your mind.</p>
<p>Oh, and one last thing: it&#39;s called &#34;The Suck&#34; for a reason. If it were easy, everyone would do it.</p>
<p>Have fun and don&#39;t knock yourself out.</p>
<p>Stay crispy, my friend,</p>
