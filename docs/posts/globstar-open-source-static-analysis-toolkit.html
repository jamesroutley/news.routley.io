    <h1>Show HN: Globstar – Open-source static analysis toolkit</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN! We’re Jai and Sanket, co-founders of DeepSource (YC W20). We&#39;re open-sourcing Globstar (<a href="https://github.com/DeepSourceCorp/globstar">https://github.com/DeepSourceCorp/globstar</a>), a static analysis toolkit that lets you easily write and run custom code quality and security checkers in YAML [1] or Go [2].</p><p>After 5+ years of building AST-based static analyzers that process millions of lines of code daily at DeepSource, we kept hearing a common request from customers: &#34;How do we write custom checks specific to our codebase?&#34; AppSec and DevOps teams have a lot of learned anti-patterns and security rules they want to enforce across their orgs, and being able to do that without being a static analysis expert, came up as an important want.</p><p>We initially built an internal framework using tree-sitter [3] for our proprietary infrastructure-as-code analyzers, which enabled us to rapidly create new checkers. We realized that making the framework open-source could solve this problem for everyone.</p><p>Our key insight was that writing checkers isn&#39;t the hard part anymore. Modern AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude are excellent at generating tree-sitter queries with very high accuracy. We realized that the tree-sitters&#39; gnarly s-expression syntax isn’t a problem anymore (since the AI will be doing all the generation anyway), and we can instead focus on building a fast, flexible, and reliable checker runtime around it.</p><p>So instead of creating yet another DSL, we use tree-sitter&#39;s native query syntax. Yes, the expressions look more complex than simplified DSLs, but they give you direct access to your code&#39;s actual AST structure – which means your rules work exactly as you&#39;d expect them to. When you need to debug a rule, you&#39;re working with the actual structure of your code, not an abstraction that might hide important details.</p><p>We&#39;ve also designed Globstar to have a gradual learning curve: The YAML interface works well for simple checkers, and the Go Interface can handle complex scenarios when you need features like cross-file analysis, scope resolution, data flow analysis, and context awareness. The Go API gives you direct access to tree-sitter bindings, so you can write arbitrarily complex checkers on day one.</p><p>Key features:</p><p>- Written in Go with native tree-sitter bindings, distributed as a single binary</p><p>- MIT-licensed</p><p>- Write all your checkers in a “.globstar” folder in your repo, in YAML or Go, and just run “globstar check” without any build steps</p><p>- Multi-language support through tree-sitter (20+ languages today)</p><p>We have a long way to go and a very exciting roadmap for Globstar, and we’d love to hear your feedback!</p><p>[1] <a href="https://globstar.dev/guides/writing-yaml-checker" rel="nofollow">https://globstar.dev/guides/writing-yaml-checker</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://globstar.dev/guides/writing-go-checker" rel="nofollow">https://globstar.dev/guides/writing-go-checker</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/" rel="nofollow">https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/</a></p></div></td></div></div>
