    <h1>Opposing arrows of time can theoretically emerge from certain quantum systems</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>The study, published in Scientific Reports, explored how a quantum system – the world of the sub-atomic – interacts with its environment, known as an ‘open quantum system’. Researchers investigated why we perceive time as moving in one direction, and whether this perception emerges from open quantum mechanics. </p><p>To simplify the problem, the team made two key assumptions. First, they treated the vast environment surrounding the system in such a way that they could focus only on the quantum system itself. Second, they assumed that the environment – like the entire universe – is so large that energy and information dissipate into it, never returning. This approach enabled them to examine how time emerges as a one-way phenomenon, even though, at the microscopic level, time could theoretically move in both directions. </p><p>Even after applying these assumptions, the system behaved the same way whether time moved forward or backwards. This discovery provided a mathematical foundation for the idea that time-reversal symmetry still holds in open quantum systems – suggesting that time’s arrow may not be as fixed as we experience it. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
