    <p>The plot device <em>cliffhanger</em> is first found in print in Variety magazine, a US trade weekly magazine focused on entertainment, in 1930. Instead of its current meaning, the term then meant a movie serial, referencing the cliche of a short ending with a character dangling off a cliff awaiting rescue. <em>Cliffhanger</em> gained its current meaning of “suspenseful situation” in 1950, again by association with that cliche.</p>

<p>Cliffhangers as a plot device are of course far older than that word. The iconic 1914 movie serial <em>The Perils of Pauline</em> includes two shorts that end with the heroine literally hanging off a cliff. Fifty years earlier and one medium over, Charles Dickens’s cliffhanger-laden serial fiction defined the style of the genre by 1860. Over a thousand years before that, أَلْفُ لَيْلَةٍ وَلَيْلَةٌ (Alf Laylah wa-Laylah), meaning “One Thousand and One Nights”, used nightly cliffhangers as its central plot device.</p>

<p>Both <em>cliff</em> and <em>hang</em> have been English words since before English existed. They are probably more than 2000 and less than 4000 years old.</p>
