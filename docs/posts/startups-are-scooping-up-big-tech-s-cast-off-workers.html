    <h1>Startups Are Scooping Up Big Tech’s Cast-Off Workers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
         <p>Startups are recruiting a growing number of laid-off software developers, data scientists and engineers, luring them away from larger employers—and bigger paychecks—with a chance to build software capabilities from the ground up, tech recruiters and investors say. </p>
         <p>Other startup perks include permanent remote- or hybrid-work models and equity stakes with more upside potential than those offered by mature companies’ stock options.</p>
