    <h1>An introduction to the impact of native planting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
<p>I love a happy ending, especially when it comes to anything relating to nature. You may have seen that I&#39;m very engrossed in <a href="https://marisamorby.com/urn-shaped-flowers/">researching native plants</a> and <a href="https://marisamorby.notion.site/Native-PPL-List-f4ff4d951f5d494eb3ecc505325b7e97">putting together my plant list</a> as I build out my garden.</p>
<p>Planting natives has such a tremendous positive impact on wildlife diversity, all the way from bugs to birds. I&#39;ve recently loved reading the work of <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/meet-ecologist-who-wants-unleash-wild-backyard-180974372/">Doug Tallamy </a>who has a goal to reintroduce natives and wildlife into our backyards.</p>
<p>In one home study he did in 2014, he counted the number of caterpillars he saw on one native white oak tree: 410 caterpillars and 19 different species. On one native tree. On one native black cherry, he found 239 caterpillars and 14 different species. Then, he took a look at a non-native plant; his Callery pear tree. On that tree he found one inchworm. That&#39;s it. One worm.</p>
<p>And you may think: well, I don&#39;t want caterpillars because they eat the leaves of my plants. But what you&#39;re missing is that caterpillars are the main source of food for the majority of baby birds. In fact it takes over <a href="https://blog.nwf.org/2015/04/chickadees-show-why-birds-need-native-trees/">5,000 bugs (mainly caterpillars)</a> to raise one clutch of baby birds.  Having insects in your yard supports biodiversity and increases all types of wildlife that are just looking for food and shelter to survive.</p>
<h3>What makes a plant native to an area?</h3>
<p>If we&#39;re considering planting only or mainly natives in our gardens, the first question that might come up is, what makes a plant native to an area? A friend asked me this recently, and it was a great question (thanks AJ!).</p>
<p>The answer is more convoluted than you might think.</p>
<p>According to the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) <a href="https://www.nwf.org/Garden-for-wildlife/about/native-plants#:~:text=A%20plant%20is%20considered%20native,as%20well%20as%20native%20plants.">a plant is considered native</a> if it has &#34;occurred naturally in a particular region, ecosystem, or habitat without human introduction&#34;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/Native_Plant_Materials/whatare.shtml">U.S. Forest Service</a> adds that for North America specifically, a plant is considered native if it meets the criteria above and was present prior to the introduction of European settlers.</p>
<p>Another important aspect that isn&#39;t considered directly in the definitions above, but is touched on, is that many native plants co-evolved with wildlife that either depend on them for food, shelter, or breeding ground. Often, native plants have a symbiotic relationship with wildlife that is highly region-specific. The Fender&#39;s Blue Butterfly is a great example of this.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in planting native plants in your garden, remember that each region has specific natives. To start, do a google search similar to &#34;native plants of Portland, Oregon&#34;, or whatever your city and state might be. That will lead you to figure out what region you&#39;re in (e.g. Portland is in the Willamette Valley), and you can start to find local resources on native plants.</p>
<p>And when you&#39;re buying plants, remember to match the scientific names at the nursery to your plant list, <strong>not</strong> the common names. ï»¿Common names can be very confusing, and are often wrong when identifying natives.</p>
<h3>Why should I focus on native plants in my garden?</h3>
<p>In short, native plants will help you achieve almost any goal you might have for your garden.</p>
<p>There are so many goals that people garden for, and when you say &#34;I did some gardening today&#34;, iï»¿t likely conjures up different activities depending on who you&#39;re speaking with.</p>
<p>Some people garden specifically for an edible garden. They&#39;re trying to get as much food out of their garden as possible. Others garden for blooms, attempting to get a view full of flowers. And others garden for wildlife, using plantings to create homes and food for whatever animals may be outside their door.</p>
<p>And even others actually highly dislike gardening, but happen to have a yard, so they want to do as little as possible to maintain beauty but also not spend much time or money.</p>
<p>Happily, selecting the right native plants can achieve every single one of these goals above, depending on what you plant and the density at which you plant it.</p>
<p>Personally, I love gardening for wildlife. I love my home and also love the natural world around me, so want to support that life in the best way possible.</p>
<h3>Getting started with native planting</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re in the USA and are interested in learning more about native planting in your area, the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/wildflowers/links">Native Plant Societies</a> page on the U.S. Forest Service site is a great place to start!ï»¿ A little tip: search for your state on the page by hitting <code>command F</code> (or <code>control F</code>) and then type in your state. The plant societies are not uniformly named and so your state may be difficult to find.</p>
<p>Happy Planting!! ðŸŒ»</p>
