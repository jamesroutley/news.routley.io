<p>We’re happy to announce a new release of ClojureScript. If you’re an existing
user of ClojureScript please read over the following release notes carefully.</p>
<p>This release features two significant dependency changes. First, Google Closure
Compiler has been updated to <code>v20250402</code>. This change makes Java 21 a
requirement for ClojureScript. The other significant change is that this release
now depends on the Clojure fork of Google Closure Library. Please read on for
more details about these changes.</p>
<p>For a complete list of fixes, changes, and enhancements to
ClojureScript see

<div>
<p>Last year we noted that updating Google Closure Compiler would mean losing Java
8 support. Google Closure now requires Java 21. From our perspective this change
doesn’t seem strictly necessary, but Google is a large organization and this
change is likely to due to internal requirements which are hard to influence from
the outside. The general enthusiasm in the Clojure community around adopting more
recent Java releases hopefully softens the overall impact of this change.</p>
<p>So far, the burden of staying current with Google Closure has been manageable.
If for some reason that calculus changes, we could adopt the strategy we have taken
with Google Closure Library.</p>

<h2 id="_clojures_fork_of_google_closure_library"><a href="#_clojures_fork_of_google_closure_library"></a>Clojure’s Fork of Google Closure Library</h2>
<div>
<p>The incredible stability of Google Closure Library started declining around
2019. Google was both trying many things with respect to their internal
JavaScript strategy as well as becoming less concerned about the impact on outside
consumers. Finally, Google stopped contributing to Google Closure Library
last August.</p>
<p>We have forked Google Closure Library (GCL) and taken up maintenance. We backed out a
few years of needless breaking changes and aligned the codebase with the latest
Google Closure Compiler release.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of GCL is that it makes ClojureScript a complete
solution for a variety of JavaScript contexts, not limited to the browser.
Taking on additional dependencies always comes with a cost. One of
ClojureScript’s original value propositions was a rock solid set of readily
available JavaScript tools as dependable as <code>clojure.core</code>.</p>
<p>We are working on restoring that original stability. With this release, you’ll
find that quite a few old ClojureScript libraries work again today as well
as they did <strong>14 years</strong> ago.</p>
<p>ClojureScript is not and never was only just for rich web applications. Even in the
post React-world, a large portion of the web is (sensibly) still using jQuery. If you need
robust DOM manipulation, internationalization, date/time handling, color
value manipulation, mathematics, programmatic animation, browser history management,
accessibility support, graphics, and much more, all without committing to a framework
and without bloating your final JavaScript artifact - ClojureScript is a one
stop shop.</p>
<p>Give it a try!</p>
