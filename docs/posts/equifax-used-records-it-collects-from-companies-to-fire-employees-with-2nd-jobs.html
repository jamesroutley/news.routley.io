    <h1>Equifax used records it collects from companies to fire employees with 2nd jobs</h1>

                      <li aria-level="1">Equifax investigated and fired at least 24 remote workers for secretly holding second jobs.</li>
                      <li>The company used The Work Number, one of its own products, to track the peoples&#39; employment records.</li>
                      <li>Executives, especially in the tech industry, have said they&#39;re worried that some remote employees are distracted.</li>
                      </ul><p>Credit-reporting giant Equifax has fired at least two dozen employees for working undisclosed jobs, and used extensive work-history records it holds on more than 100 million Americans to catch them, according to documents and interviews with people familiar with the matter.</p><p>In one of the latest signs of corporate America trying to regain control of an increasingly remote workforce, CEO Mark Begor this week informed employees that some of their &#34;teammates&#34; were fired for having &#34;a second full-time job while maintaining their full-time role at EFX,&#34; which is the ticker symbol for Equifax.</p><p>&#34;We expect our team to be fully dedicated to EFX and have one role …their job at EFX,&#34; Begor wrote in a recent company-wide email, a copy of which was obtained by Insider. &#34;I am sure you are as disappointed as I am.&#34;</p><p>The crackdown was the result of an investigation that unfolded in recent months conducted by Equifax employees, including HR and cybersecurity, according to a document seen by Insider. Those leading the investigation combed through work histories and activity records for more than 1,000 employees and contractors, according to an Equifax employee who was not authorized to speak publicly and internal records seen by Insider.</p><p>The company used various code names for its investigation, including &#34;Project Home Alone&#34; and &#34;Project Page 12,&#34;  according to the employee and company records. &#34;Project Page 12&#34; is named after the section of the company handbook that bans employees from working two jobs without approval, this person said.</p><p>Equifax used one of its own products, The Work Number, to help it suss out who was holding down multiple jobs simultaneously. The product has employment records, including weekly pay, of 105 million US workers, according to the company&#39;s last annual report.</p><p>At one point, 25 employees were interviewed on the investigation&#39;s findings, and 24 were terminated, resulting in savings of $3.2 million, according to a document. At another point, Equifax flagged 283 contractors for potential &#34;dual employment,&#34; documents show. It&#39;s unclear whether any of them were terminated as a result of the probe.</p><p>Equifax spokesperson Kate Walker confirmed in an email that several employees were recently terminated &#34;because of multiple factors, including in many cases their own admission that they had a secondary full-time position.&#34; Some were working three jobs, she said. </p><h2>Some cybersecurity employees were terminated</h2><p>Walker said that the company has since February allowed many employees to work from the office for three days a week, from home for two days a week, and from anywhere for two weeks a year.</p><p>Some employees may have even dialed into interviews with Equifax, conducted as part of the probe, from another job site, she said, including one who worked as a nurse, and another who claimed he was at home while sitting in what looked like an office cubicle.</p><p>The investigation also used manager feedback and unexplained periods where a worker wasn&#39;t available during the workday, Walker said. It also flagged employees with &#34;abnormally low VPN usage,&#34; defined as less than 13 hours per work week.</p><p>At least some of the people fired for working two jobs held cybersecurity roles at  Equifax, an area where the company made many hires in the wake of its 2017 data breach, according to two people with knowledge of the terminations.</p><p>&#34;They said, &#39;when you started, you signed a paper, an agreement, for noncompete work,&#39;&#34; said one of the people, who says he was fired after admitting to having a &#34;side hustle&#34; that he says didn&#39;t compete with Equifax. &#34;I was like &#39;OK, but I wasn&#39;t working in the same field.&#39;&#34;</p><p>The fired employee said he wasn&#39;t aware of company policy requiring employees to get &#34;prior approval&#34; from their managers and an HR official to hold a second job.</p><p>Walker said the company&#39;s code of conduct, which employees are supposed to regularly review and sign off on, says staff &#34;always need to disclose and discuss outside employment with your supervisor.&#34; That policy has been in place since 2017, she said. The employee handbook is less strict, saying only that employees are &#34;expected to notify&#34; their supervisors of outside work.</p><h2>The Work Number holds extensive records</h2><p>One of the tools that Equifax used to investigate its employees is a product called The Work Number, or TWN, part of the company&#39;s lucrative and fast-growing Workforce Solutions segment, according to Equifax&#39;s securities filings.</p><p>&#34;We are now receiving records every pay period from 2.5 million companies, up from 1 million when we started [in] 2021 and 27,000 contributors a short two-plus years ago,&#34; its <a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_93e313677404882794e6927b17251ef5/equifax/db/2054/19275/annual_report/EFX011_Equifax_2021-Annual-Report_Web+%281%29.pdf" data-analytics-module="body_link">2021 annual report</a> said. &#34;Our lens is expanding beyond US non-farm payroll to include… 40-50 million gig and self-employed workers and 20-30 million pensioners…&#34;</p><p>Mortgage and auto lenders use TWN reports, as do government agencies evaluating welfare applications, according to Equifax&#39;s website, which says reports start at $55 a pop. Information in the reports comes from employers and payroll processors. According to Equifax, different reports are provided to different entities, with information varying depending on the type of verification needed. </p><p>The authors of this piece requested their own TWN reports and found that almost every job both had ever held was listed in the report. In one author&#39;s case, this included all salaried positions since graduating college in 2013, as well as a job working in the college library as a student.</p><p>In the other author&#39;s case, the report dated back to a student gig calling his college&#39;s alumni and asking for donations in 2010. Every paycheck he&#39;d received in three jobs held since 2014 was also in the report.</p><p>The only things missing from his report were two unpaid internships and a high-school job in a restaurant kitchen.</p><p>Such extensive information would not be provided to third parties, according to Equifax. For example, an employer requesting employment verification would not be able to see applicants&#39; salary histories, Walker said.</p><p>The Equifax employee who spoke with Insider expressed concern about the investigations. &#34;I&#39;m not sure how Equifax can be trusted with data when it uses it to spy on its own employees,&#34; the person said.</p><p>Walker said the company&#39;s use of its data &#34;followed all applicable laws.&#34;</p><h2>Remote employees face increased scrutiny from employers</h2><p>Working from home appears to have led to a rise in workers doubling up on jobs, with more than two-third of remote employees<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/over-two-thirds-us-remote-workers-two-or-more-jobs-2021-11" data-analytics-module="body_link"> surveyed in 2021</a> saying they had multiple jobs. One big reason cited was money. The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/second-jobs-secret-salary-income-money-remote-work-overemployed-2021-8" data-analytics-module="body_link">reported in 2021</a> that some employees were making $200,000 to $600,000 a year by juggling the demands of multiple employers, with one dropping in and out of double-booked meetings and making up excuses about internet connectivity issues.</p><p>Employers can frown on second jobs if they stand to interfere with a worker&#39;s performance and productivity, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-managers-react-employee-working-two-full-time-jobs-2022-7" data-analytics-module="body_link">according to managers</a> who have shared their stories with Insider. Companies can also crack down if they are concerned that a second job could reveal trade secrets or misuse of company resources, <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-my-employer-fire-me-for-working-a-second-job.html" data-analytics-module="body_link">according to legal website Nolo.com. </a></p><p>For a company like Equifax, this trends represents a potential business opportunity. The company sells a product called Talent Report Employment Monitoring so other companies can keep tabs on potential moonlighting by their employees, too. &#34;With predictions of more than 36 million employees working remotely by the year 2025, the need to monitor an employee&#39;s employment status will continue to grow,&#34; the company says in <a href="https://assets.equifax.com/wfs/theworknumber/assets/TWN_Talent_Report_Employment.pdf" data-analytics-module="body_link">marketing material</a>. </p><p>&#34;I think what we fundamentally are seeing is a power struggle that&#39;s happening between organizations and employees more broadly,&#34; said Stacia Sherman Garr, a co-founder of RedThread Research, a talent management company. &#34;The significant push to return to office, particularly by senior executives, is a manifestation of that power struggle.&#34;</p>
