<h2><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#006666">The Main Screen,<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h2>
</center><p>This is where the Nukefix program substantially
begins. The following is the screen shown on startup. By
clicking on any of page in list of pages shown here, you can
go to commentary in that subject area when running Nukefix.
By repeatedly clicking on the &#34;More&#34; button, you
can see all the topics covered.</p>
<p><strong>The challenge is to explore conditions that
create a safer system than the base case that is shown.
</strong>In the particular case being considered, the graph
line in the center of the screen shows the probability of a
nuclear use when each nation, on average, would have a
probability of initiating a nuclear use once in 295 years,
during the period under consideration. As explained in the
text of the program, this would apply, regardless of what
probability distributions existed or whether events were
random or nonrandom. </p>
<p>Typically when running Nukefix, you will model many other
conditions to see the outcomes that tend to result when
conditions change.<br/> </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/st1.gif" width="644" height="484"/>
 </p>
</center>
<p>In this case where we are looking at an average
probability of one chance in 295 years for each nation, we
also know that a nuclear use can be caused by an Accidental
Use or a Willful Use. So we can see in the top four windows
what reliability levels are required in these areas, and in
their subcomponents. We ultimately are able to see the levels
of competence (as reflected by a low proclivity to accident)
and levels of caution (as reflected by a low propensity to
willfully initiate a nuclear use) that are required to
sustain the peace at designated probabilities. </p>
<p>We can carry this dissection further because Willful Use
results from a simultaneous failure of Deterrence and
Civility. With respect to Deterrence we are also able to see
how reliable the formal decision-making process needs to be
(as reflected by Decision Error) and the influence of
Irrationality in the psychiatric/psychological/emotional
sense of the term (e.g., in the extreme form, crazy or
insane). Similarly Civility is broken down into its
constituent parts. </p>
<p>The user can change any of these values by clicking on
them when running Nukefix, for example, to test how much
Civility would be required if Deterrence were eliminated, or
to test to what degree Morality can favorably influence
outcome. One can also test the effectiveness of Deterrence by
setting it to very high values. </p>
<p>The results may surprise you. Ultimately, you can see the
levels of stewardship that are required of nations to sustain
nuclear peace at a range of probabilities. </p>
<p>In the case shown, there would be a 50% chance of a
nuclear use occurring somewhere in the world within 22.7
years (as is now indicated at the point of the mouse arrow in
the above graph). This performance, of course, can be
improved or made worse depending on what levels of
reliability you apply to the different nations. </p>
<p>While we may not know with certainty what humans will do,
we are capable of knowing with certainty what levels of
restraint each nation must deliver if nuclear peace is to be
sustained at designated probability levels for specific
lengths of time. </p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">The Menu<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>On the main screen you will see the
&#34;Menu&#34; button. If you had clicked on this button
when running Nukefix. The following screen would have
appeared and an explanation of each command would be shown,
as it is in the &#34;L&#34; (Life) command below. </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/stmenu.gif" width="644" height="484"/>
 </p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">Probability of a Nuclear Use During Your Remaining
Lifetime<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>Based on the probability of a nuclear use in the
case under consideration and actuarial data for human life
expectancy, Nukefix can calculate the probability of a
nuclear use occurring somewhere in the world during your, or
your children&#39;s, remaining lifetime. </p>
<p>For example, after entering the &#34;L&#34; (Life)
command shown in the above snapshot of the menu, the
following screen would appear, when one requested the outcome
for a baby one year old. </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/ageone.gif" width="644" height="484"/>
 </p>
</center><p>The red window shows that in the given case for
one year olds there would be a 73% chance of a nuclear use
during their remaining lifetimes. Probabilities of occurrence
in one&#39;s remaining lifetime decline with advancing age
because of reduced life expectancy. In the given case for
other age groups the following pairings would be found to
apply: 14 years old, 65%; 20, 61%; 35, 49%; 50, 35%; 75, 13%;
and 85, 7%. </p>
<p>Using Nukefix&#39;s &#34;^L&#34; command you can readily
see expected outcomes under different conditions and for
different age groups. (Note that the &#34;Learning
Curve&#34; on the pages button is shown with a gray
background. This indicates that it was accessed prior to the
screen snapshot having been taken.)</p>

<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/intro.gif" width="644" height="484"/>
 </p>
</center><p>As you continued reading you would see Feynman
saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>In fact, previous NASA experience had shown
on occasion just such difficulties, . . . all giving warning
that the probability of flight failure was not so very small.
. . .</p>
<p>&#34;It would appear that, for whatever purpose -- be it
for internal or external consumption -- the management of
NASA exaggerates the reliability of its product to the point
of fantasy. . . .</p>
<p>&#34;Let us make recommendations to ensure that NASA
officials deal in a world of reality, understanding
technological weaknesses and imperfections well enough to be
actively trying to eliminate them. . . .</p>
<p>&#34;For successful technology, reality must take
precedence over public relations, FOR NATURE CANNOT BE FOOLED
[Emphasis added, <a href="http://www.nukefix.org/forecast.html"> F&amp;S</a>, p. v].&#34; </p>
</blockquote><p>Feynman&#39;s teachings are applicable in the
nuclear weapons case. Nukefix goes on to make the point:</p>
<blockquote><center><p><strong>The Epidemic</strong> </p>
</center><p>It is perplexing that we live in a
technologically advanced civilization that is amply able to
assess and prevent a major public health risk, yet it chooses
to largely ignore it. Instead, it focuses on less substantial
dangers, many of which are trivial.</p>
<p>For example, consider a hypothetical microbe, which at a
steady rate causes 2,369,886 deaths per year. By comparison
to the number of deaths normally occurring in the United
States in a typical year: In 3.7 months this microbe would
cause as many deaths as heart disease; in 2.8 months, as many
deaths as cancer; in 2.1 months, as many deaths as are
attributed to cigarette smoking; in 6 days, as many deaths as
AIDS; and in 4.2 weeks, as many deaths as lung diseases
(including pneumonia and influenza). In 6.7 days it would
cause as many deaths as all car accidents; in 30.6 minutes,
as many deaths as all floods; in 20.9 minutes, as many deaths
as tornadoes and hurricanes; in 18.4 minutes, as many deaths
as lightning; and in 5.9 days, as many deaths as all guns in
the United States (including all homicides, suicides and
accidents). In 11.7 months it would cause as many deaths as
all current causes of death combined. This is the risk of
death that would be continuously faced.</p>
<p>Within 3.1 months the microbe would produce as many
deaths as the U.S. military suffered in all wars to date
during the 20th century -- World War I, World War II, Korea,
Vietnam, and the Gulf War combined.</p>
<p>However, it is not a microorganism that presents such an
extraordinary public health risk. The expected long-term
average of 2,369,886 direct deaths per year (not including
retaliations, fallout, etc.) is the worldwide risk caused by
the aggressor/initiator alone, when 9 nations present
propensities to initiate nuclear strikes of the sizes
indicated in this program. You also can easily model more
favorable conditions and different size strikes.</p>
<p>You will soon see how and why such an analysis can be
made.<br/>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal in Nukefix is to reduce or eliminate these
deaths. <strong>You can literally &#34;re-write the
book.&#34; You are not locked into the above opening
paragraphs.</strong> If you find other levels of restraint or
number of warheads better explain current conditions, or if
you expect improved conditions in the future (e.g., each
superpower reducing its arsenal to 3,500 or fewer warheads),
you can enter them into Nukefix. Indeed, often just clicking
on the graph on the main screen or accessing the
&#34;T&#34; (Treaty) command is enough. <strong>The above
paragraphs will automatically rewrite themselves to reflect
the consequences of whatever changes you make.</strong></p>
<p>For example, if you had set a limit on the number of
weapons to 3,500 in the superpowers [using the &#34;T&#34;
(Treaty) command], the text have read as in the following.
The difference between the figures shown in brackets (which
were added here for illustration) and the initial values
would illustrate the risk reduction that took place when
going from the initial number of nuclear weapons to a maximum
of 3,500 per superpower as proposed in START II. As can be
seen, the risk of death remained quite substantial, but it
was reduced:</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, consider a hypothetical microbe,
which at a steady rate causes 1,828,997 [instead of
2,369,886] deaths per year. By comparison to the number of
deaths normally occurring in the United States in a typical
year: In 4.8 [instead of 3.7] months this microbe would cause
as many deaths as heart disease; in 3.6 [instead of 2.8]
months, as many deaths as cancer . . . [etc.] In 1.3 years
[instead of 11.7 months] it would cause as many deaths as all
current causes of death combined. This is the risk of death
that would be continuously faced.</p>
</blockquote><p>The Nukefix program will show you how and
why such an analysis can be made. This is just a small sample
of the text. Numerous other areas of the nuclear weapons
issue are covered with considerable specificity. </p>
<p>Nukefix is as much a book, as it is a computer program.
However, unlike a book you are not confined to the author&#39;s
views. You can develop the conditions and the text by the
changes you make. </p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">Reducing Risk of Death<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>There are only two ways to reduce risk of death
caused by nuclear weapons: 1) to reduce the probability of
occurrence and/or 2) to reduce the severity of occurrence.
All nuclear weapons risk reduction hinges on the ability to
achieve desirable outcomes in these areas. The nuclear
weapons problem poses such high risks of death that it
requires that both be employed.</p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">Enunciating the Problem in a Kernel<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>Nuclear deterrence presents an imbalance that is
directly at odds with the principle of reducing severity. It
effectively is the intent of nuclear deterrence to exchange a
&#34;large number of deaths&#34; for a very &#34;low
probability&#34; of their occurrence. By this technique,
nuclear deterrence increases severity in the hopes of
reducing probability. This technique can only be successful
in reducing average annual risk of war deaths if the
reduction in probability is proportionally greater than the
increase in severity. It is doubtful that nuclear deterrence
meets this criterion [This can be seen on the deterrence page in the computer
program Nukefix].</p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300"><a name="accident">
 </a>The Imperious Roles of Accident and Miscalculation<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p><strong>The distinguishing feature of the
nuclear weapons system is NOT nuclear deterrence, but the
combined influence of accident and miscalculation.
</strong>Under the conditions shown in the main screen at
startup, there would be a 89.2% probability [89.2% = 66.6% +
22.6%] that a nuclear first use would result from
miscalculation or accident, and probability for all causes of
a nuclear first use can be subdivided as follow: </p>
<!--mstheme--></SPAN><!--msthemelist--><table>

objective, i.e., the aggressor won the war.<!--mstheme--></SPAN><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>
<!--msthemelist--></tbody></table><!--mstheme--><SPAN face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>With an expected 2,369,886 deaths per year, if 89.2% of
the incidents were caused by miscalculation or accident,
then, on average, as many as 2,114,675 deaths per year could
readily be attributable to nuclear weapon accident or
miscalculation [2,114,675 = 89.2% x 2,369,886].</p>
<p>There are obviously all sorts of variants in the kind of
conditions that one can develop by changing the values shown
on the main screen. But the central point is that it is
difficult, with nine nuclear weapon nations, to construct
plausible scenarios of long-term nuclear peace where the
influence of miscalculation and accident is acceptably low,
when there is a predominant reliance on nuclear deterrence
[calculations shown on the deterrence page in Nukefix]. </p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">Main Screen Capabilities<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>The main screen has numerous capabilities. The
following are shots of some of the messages that will appear.
And, if you want to supress automatic prompts you can easily
do so by pressing the &#34;S&#34; (Suspend) key. </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/mainmsg.gif" width="641" height="770"/>
 </p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">Base Case Comparison<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>One of the features available is the &#34;Base
Case&#34; comparison. Note that the Main Screen shown
earlier indicated the longevity of nuclear peace when each
nation was sufficiently peaceful that it would have a
propensity to initiate a nuclear use, on average, only once
in 295 years (the Composite Reluctance Level).</p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/stbc.gif" width="644" height="484"/>
 </p>
</center><p>We can also see the advantage if, on average,
each nation were to become sufficiently peaceful that it
would not tend to initiate a nuclear use but once in 500
years. By having employed the &#34;Base Case&#34;
comparison feature, we see that the bottom center blue window
on the screen shows that at the median there would tend to be
15.8 years more of nuclear peace than at the previous 295 RL.
</p>
<p>Thus, using the &#34;Base Case Comparison&#34; we can
get some idea of how great a change in the longevity of
nuclear peace we can reasonably expect if features of the
nuclear weapons system change. </p>
<p>As a practical matter it is useful to note that when
running the program, clicking on the graph is all that is
required to reposition the graph line to pass through the
point that you click on. Thus, it is quite easy to see what
reliability goals nations must meet if they are to sustain
nuclear peace at designated probability levels for designated
periods of time. </p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">Proliferation<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>Although there is a lot of discussion about
proliferation and nonproliferation, too frequently the
consequences of proliferation are so vaguely stated that we
have very little idea how much influence the addition or
reduction of, say, four nations would have on the longevity
of nuclear peace. </p>
<p>The &#34;P&#34; (proliferation) command provides the
following screen.</p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/stpro.gif" width="644" height="484"/>
 </p>
</center><p>For simplicity&#39;s sake, if we assume that the
only feature that changes is the number of nations, and that
each nation is effectively equally peaceful with a proclivity
to initiate one nuclear use, on average, once every 295 years
(as it was in the first screen snapshot), then we can see,
using the &#34;Base Case Comparison&#34; in the above
that:</p>
<!--mstheme--></SPAN><!--msthemelist--><table compact="">

peace than 9 nations would.<!--mstheme--></SPAN><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>
<!--msthemelist--></tbody></table><!--mstheme--><SPAN face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>This example is of interest because during the Cold War
there were approximately an average 5 nuclear weapon nations.
Now there are about 9. If there were further proliferation,
there could be as many as 13. With this, we have the
beginnings of &#34;Past, Present, and Future&#34; analysis.
The program also offers other ways to analyze proliferation,
but this screen gives us a good starting point. </p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">Specific Nations<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>On the initial Main Screen the upper four small
windows showed the &#34;average&#34; values for all
nations. If we want to see what a specific nation would have
to deliver then we just click on the <strong>name</strong> of
the nation, in this case China, then the upper four windows
are bordered in blue. And, the upper windows display the
specific subcomponent values China would have to maintain to
support its 450 RL. You will see that these values are higher
than they were in the first Main Screen, where it was only
necessary to support a 295 RL, instead of the 450 RL required
by China. </p>
<p>Though China might not deliver the precise subcomponents
shown, we would know that that it would have to deliver some
combination that would ultimately produce a 450 RL and we can
experiment with different values to see the ranges of
performances that would need to be met. </p>
<p>By changing subcomponent values for China, we can also
see how much a specific value in a single nation (say,
deterrence, since that is such a popular topic) would
influence median years of nuclear peace world wide. This
feature is especially useful for analyzing policies that are

<h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">Public Health Risk, Deaths per 100,000<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>In terms of public health, the lethality of a
disease can be measured in annual deaths per 100,000 population. By making
comparisons between death rates for different public health
risks, we can get a sense of the relative severity of the
risks that a population as a whole would face. </p>
<p>For example, AIDS and Heart Diseases are measured in
deaths per 100,000 per year. We can also compare nuclear
weapon risks to other known health risks by using the deaths
per 100,000 per year method, as is done in the following
graph, which is activated by the &#34;D&#34; (Death)
command.</p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/dth.gif" width="644" height="484"/>
 </p>
</center>
<p>The curve represents the average risk during the median
years to occurrence for attacks of specific sizes and for
worldwide levels of peacefulness (Composite Reluctance
Level). The mouse arrow at the graph line points to the 295
RL that we have discussed. If the shown number of deaths
worldwide would occur, because of nuclear attacks, then
nuclear weapons would present a worldwide risk at least as
great as AIDS, and in the recipient nation the national death
rate would be much higher. </p>
<p>The present graph line spells out the minimum
requirements placed on nations, if nuclear weapons are to
present a worldwide risk no greater than AIDS. </p>
<p>By clicking on the graph, when running the Nukefix
program, the graph line is automatically repositioned at the
point where you click. Thus, it can illustrate comparisons
with other diseases also. </p>
<p>It is well to note that since 1914, &#34;small&#34;
wars (those less than a million deaths) have been responsible
for only 12% of war deaths, civilian and military. It is the
Mega-Death wars that have caused fully 88% of war deaths
[<cite><a href="http://www.nukefix.org/forecast.html">Forecast and Solution</a>,</cite> p. 127]. For this
reason, reducing the effects of large wars, especially
nuclear wars, is apt to yield great public health benefit.
Prior to WWI only two Mega-Death wars had occurred -- a civil
war in China in the middle 1800s and Genghis Khan&#39;s
destruction in the 1200s. Mega-Death wars are a creature of
the 20th century. </p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">The &#34;M&#34; (Multiple Blasts) Command<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>Bernard Lown has observed: &#34;Few societies
are more susceptible to the malevolent consequences of a
nuclear detonation than rich, urbanized, highly developed,
industrial countries.&#34; </p>
<p>This is true for reasons that few suspect. </p>
<p>For example, a 3+ psi (pounds per square inch static
overpressure) destruction indicates that total deaths would
be approximately equal to 56% of the average population in
the 3+ psi area. Wood-framed buildings would receive heavy
destruction, even at the outermost 3 psi limits. Destruction
would become more intense as one approached ground zero. </p>
<p>It is widely known that a single primitive 20 Kt nuclear
weapon (approximately the size used at Nagasaki) would
produce 8.04 square miles of 3+ psi destruction (when the
altitude of the blast is set to maximize 3.5+ psi
destruction.). </p>
<p>From this we can easily calculate that detonating eight
individual 20 Kt weapons would produce 64 square miles of 3+
psi destruction [64.3=8x8.04]. This is the same area of 3+
psi destruction that would occur upon detonating one 475 Kt
thermonuclear weapon. </p>
<p>On this basis, we are able to know that, at the absolute
minimum, eight individual low-tech 20 Kt nuclear weapons are
capable of producing a level a level of destruction equal to
a large thermonuclear weapon (475 Kt). </p>
<p>Now let&#39;s consider the potential consequences of
SIMULTANEOUSLY DETONATING a pattern of eight nuclear weapons.
I have not seen simultaneous nuclear air bursts discussed, or
even hinted at, in the open literature, but too many of their
effects are too obvious to ignore them. </p>
<p>As you would be able to experiment with when running
Nukefix [using the &#34;See&#34; button in the
&#34;M&#34; command as shown below], when eight low-tech 20
Kt nuclear weapons are detonated simultaneously in an
encirclement pattern (5 mile radius, 4.3 miles between zero
points in a circle) in a high population density urban area,
at least as much destruction would tend to be produced as
with a single one megaton thermonuclear weapon. The reason
for this is firestorms and the interaction of blast forces.
</p>
<p>A one megaton weapon would cause 105 square miles of 3+
psi destruction. With firestorms, the 20 Kt encirclement
pattern can readily envelope 105 square miles in total
destruction, leaving no escape for the inhabitants. At a
population density of 12,000 per square mile the 20 Kt
encirclement pattern might well produce 53% more deaths than
a single one megaton weapon, which is to say, approximately
1,082,884 deaths with 20 Kt encirclement versus approximately
708,426 deaths with a one-megaton blast. </p>
<p>A widespread shortcoming in the available literature is
that it fails to indicate the consequences of multiple
nuclear weapon detonations, most particularly SIMULTANEOUS
detonations in encirclement patterns. </p>
<p>By activating the &#34;M&#34; (Multiple Blasts) command
you can see these consequences. For example, the capabilities
of France are shown below.</p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/mfran.gif" width="644" height="484"/>
 </p>
</center><p>When running Nukefix, the following screen [in
this case for France with a 160 Kt average weapon size] would
appear after clicking on the &#34;See&#34; shown above. The
&#34;Color Heat&#34; button on that screen is ONE OF THE
MOST USEFUL IN THE PROGRAM. It illustrates the thermal energy
that would be sufficient to ignite items at points which are
in line of sight of the contributing weapons in a
SIMULTANEOUS DETONATION. <a name="simultaneous">
 </a> </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/mseefran3.gif" width="644" height="484"/>
 </p>
</center><p>The Legend indicates the areas in which the
following can be ignited: Leaves [dry beech leaves, 4-6
Cal/cm sq], Shades [cotton muslin green window shades, 8
oz/sq yd, 7-13 Cal/cm sq], Rubber [black rubber construction
material, 10-20 Cal/cm sq], and Shirt [Khaki colored cotton
shirt, 3 oz/sq yd, 14-21 Cal/cm sq] [See: Glasstone and
Dolan, <cite>The Effects of Nuclear Weapons,</cite> pp.
287-289. The thermal flux, Cal/cm sq, in this paragraph
indicates the ignition range required by weapons from 35
kilotons to 1.4 megatons]. </p>
<p>The flash from the initial simultaneous blast would be
sufficient to ignite these respective items. Not all such
items will be ignited because at least some fires will be
blown out by the blast wave. However, others will not, and
these will tend to spread. At Hiroshima (12.5 Kt), the
approximate area characterized here by rubber was involved in
a firestorm. <a name="350to800">
 </a> </p>
<p>Note that, in the Nukefix program, whatever pattern you
select will be applied to the &#34;encirclement number of
weapons (EncWep),&#34; when you access the &#34;War-Room
Plans&#34; page. That section of the program scans and sorts
the population densities for the entire world, so that you
can see how many weapons are required to destroy specified
areas of different countries. </p>
<p>For example, it takes only 354 to 800 Russian warheads to
destroy every city and town in the United States that has a
population density in excess of 1,000 people per square mile
(urban and metropolitan USA, 36.3% of the U.S. population, 94
million people) [&#34;War-Room Plans&#34; in Nukefix].
Thus, it&#39;s not difficult to see that the highly-publicized,
much-applauded, and the yet-to-be-ratified START II treaty
levels of 3,000 to 3,500 intercontinental warheads mounted on
missiles or aircraft by the year 2007 (roughly a decade from
now) offer little protection. Only 10% of these numbers of
weapons hitting cities would produce unprecedentedly
appalling destruction. Moreover, the number of warheads now
existing are far higher. </p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">The effects of simultaneous detonations have grave
implications.<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
<p>Although the high-tech aspects of the physics of a single
weapon usually receive greatest attention, the physics
involved in a confluence of blast forces and thermal energy
from multiple weapons simultaneously detonating can be made
to present far greater destruction in an urban environment
than can single thermonuclear weapons of the sizes that
currently predominate. </p>
<p>If eight 20 Kt nuclear weapons were detonated
SIMULTANEOUSLY in an encirclement pattern over a city, it is
likely that they would produce at least as much destruction
as a one megaton nuclear blast. And, they definitely could
produce the equivalent of 475 Kt of destruction, even if they
were not simultaneously detonated. </p>
<p>Fully 87% of the thermonuclear weapons in the U.S.
strategic arsenal are smaller than 475 Kt, and a small
percentage are as large as one megaton. Approximately 58% of
Russia&#39;s strategic nuclear weapons are about 500-550 Kt in
size. Thus, we can see that small nations, or even highly
advanced terrorist groups, could have the potential to
produce vast thermonuclear levels of destruction (equivalent
to 475 Kt to one megaton) when attacking cities. </p>
<p>It further means that many thousands of
&#34;tactical&#34; nuclear weapons in superpower arsenals
can similarly be used to create levels of destruction
formerly attributed only to &#34;strategic&#34; nuclear
weapons. And, &#34;strategic&#34; warheads can be made to
be even more deadly via simultaneous detonations. </p>
<p>You can readily see the magnitude of destruction produced
by nuclear weapons of all sizes, including those used in
simultaneous detonations in encirclement patterns. To do so,
in the &#34;M&#34; command, click on the &#34;See&#34;
button. </p>
<p><strong>The myth perpetuated throughout the nuclear era
that thermonuclear levels of destruction in cities are
available only to advanced, rich nuclear powers is a fraud.

<h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">War-Room Plans<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>One of the greatest problems for the non-expert,
who may be seriously interested in the nuclear weapons
problem, is to figure out what number of nuclear weapons will
targeters allocate to destroy cities. We can determine quite
a lot without having to enter their war-planning rooms.</p>
<p>The following screen snapshot is taken from the
&#34;War-Room Plans&#34; page in Nukefix. The particular
example shown illustrates the number of 550 kt warheads
Russia would need to destroy the indicated population
centers. </p>
<p>The initiating nation, in this instance Russia, can be
selected in the &#34;M&#34; (Multiple Blasts) command.
Substantially any nation that had the same encirclement
profile and size of warheads (550 kt) would produce an
identical outcome.</p>
<p><strong>&#34;EncWep&#34;</strong> refers to the number
of warheads required to subject the total area under
consideration to the same degree of destruction caused by the
encirclement pattern, in this case, when the zero point
distance is set at 15.6 miles as can be set up in the
&#34;M&#34; command under the &#34;See&#34; button.</p>
<p><strong>&#34;MaxWep&#34; </strong>refers to the maximum
number of warheads required to subject the total area under
consideration to 3 psi+ destruction. This is the same single
warhead targeting used in the &#34;M&#34; command.</p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/target.gif" width="644" height="484"/>
 </p>
</center><p>The particular page shown here indicates the
outcome for Britain and China, if 550 kt warheads were
detonated in the indicated regions. </p>
<p>For example, it would take approximately 35 to 78.3
warheads (550 kt) to destroy every population center in
Britain with a population density of 1,500, or more, per
square mile. We can also see that 22.1 million people (39.2%
of the British population) live in this area. </p>
<p>And, in China it would require approximately 1,292 to
2,887 warheads to destroy every region with a population
density of 1,500, or more, per square mile (510 million
people, 40% of the Chinese population reside in the
area).</p>
<p>In Nukefix, you can readily make similar estimates for
numerous other nations. Each page is sorted according to
population density for all nuclear weapon nations and many
non-nuclear nations. The attacking nation and its weapon
configuration can be setup in the &#34;M&#34; (Multiple
Blasts) command. So this, and similar pages in the
&#34;War-Room Plans&#34; section, will change according to
the data you enter. By this method you can make reasonable
first approximations for each nuclear weapon nation without
having to go through tedious calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Table Headings,</strong> An Explanation: </p>
<p>The <strong>&#34;Regions&#34;</strong> heading refers

<center><h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">The Probability of Nuclear Winter/Autumn<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>There are numerous factors that must be
considered before we know what size attack is sufficient to
provoke a serious enough climate change that it could be
classified as a nuclear winter/autumn, some of which are
dealt with on the &#34;Nuclear Winter/Autumn&#34; page in
Nukefix. </p>
<p>Cutting to the chase: There are various gradations of
nuclear winter that probably can be associated with
initiating attacks of specific sizes. For example, an
aggressor attack producing 100+ million direct deaths might
well be sufficient to provoke a nuclear winter/autumn of a
designated level of severity. Or, alternatively, one might
find that an aggressor attack of 200+ million would be
needed.</p>
<p>In the following Nukefix graph you can enter whatever
attack size you are interested in. And, in the upcoming
&#34;U&#34; (Ultimate) command, you can define the
underlying probabilities for the entire range of attack sizes
for each nuclear weapon nation. </p>
<p>On Nukefix&#39;s &#34;Nuclear Winter/Autumn&#34; page, we
see aggressor attacks of 100+ million direct deaths (not
counting retaliation, etc.) would tend to occur within
approximately a median 115 years, given the conditions at
startup. While this may seem to be a long time, an attack of
this size can readily occur earlier, as can be seen in the
upcoming graph. For example, as the graph shows, there would
be, with startup data, roughly a one in five chance (20%) of
a nuclear attack producing 100+ million deaths within 37
years. And, at the upper end of the graph, we find a 95%
probability of an event of this scale within the next 500
years. When running Nukefix, you can also see the expected
outcome when the number of superpower nuclear warheads are
reduced.</p>

 </p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">The Ultimate, the &#34;U&#34; Command<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>There are numerous nuclear nations. And there
are numerous attacks of different sizes that each of these
nations can deliver. For each size attack there is also a
different probability of its ever actually being initiated.
In some nations the range of attack sizes may go from less
than a million deaths to conceivably more than a billion
deaths in the most extreme cases. </p>
<p>In order to account for outcomes, which go from the
probable to the highly improbable, this program introduces
the concept of Reluctance Level (RL) Curves for each nation.
This allows you to get answers you have not had access to
before. In the &#34;U&#34; (Ultimate) command, you can
readily set each nation&#39;s RLs throughout the range. </p>
<p>RL Curves offer the two ingredients necessary to
determine the expected risk of death posed by each nation: 1)
probability of occurrence (RL), and 2) severity of occurrence
(i.e., scale of death). </p>
<p>The RL Curves, further, offer the ability to make
reasonable estimates for a wide range of occurrences, because
probability (RL) in the upcoming graphs is defined in terms
of a nation initiating the stated size attack, OR ANY ATTACK
OF A LARGER SIZE. Thus, one does not have to consider each
size attack individually. A few broad groupings are all that
is required to make a good estimate of risk. </p>
<p>For example, in Nukefix when we access the &#34;U&#34;
(Ultimate) command we can get the following reluctance level
curve for France, which shows that France under the shown
conditions would produce, over the long term, a risk of
inflicting 97,041 deaths per year in attacks that it would
have a probability of initiating. It is also possible to
explore other outcomes by simply clicking on the graph to
change the shape of the curve. However, in the real world
nations would have to meet those reliabilities. And I point
out that France is already represented as being very
peaceful.</p>

 </p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">The proof/method for determining expected deaths per
year<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>In Nukefix, clicking on the &#34;DPY
Method&#34; button would produce the upcoming graph, which
illustrates how one can determine death rate. </p>
<p>But it well to first consider the matter in prose.
Indeed, without performing the math, the method is
intuitively obvious. Consider that each point on the curve
represents the probability of a stated size attack and all
larger attacks. Given two adjacent points on the curve, if
the smaller of the two probabilities is subtracted from the
larger, all that remains is the probability associated with
the smaller size attack. When this is done for each point on
the curve, then all probabilities of occurrence have been
identified, and, as indicated, computation of expected death
per year is quite easy. </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/u2fran.gif" width="644" height="484"/>
 </p>
</center><p>The math can be performed in the following
manner: The &#34;expected deaths per year&#34; caused by
the aggressor/initiator&#39;s attack (DPY) are determined by
multiplying each incremental probability (the difference in
probability at adjacent points on the curve) by the
corresponding level of death indicated on the x-axis, and
adding the sum of these values to the high-end RL probability
multiplied times its corresponding level of death. Simply
stated, the method accounts for all probability levels and
all sizes of attack for all nations -- which, incidentally,
come to 2,945 different cases. It can fully explain the total
probability attributed to an individual nation, and
axiomaticly conforms to mathematical expectation (i.e.,
multiplying probability times the severity of the event).
</p>
<p>By using these techniques, it is possible to know the
average risk of death when given specific RL curves. In these
cases, as seen in the &#34;DPY Method&#34; graph,
probabilities are the inverse of the RLs in question. </p>
<p>The DPY graph gives a practical demonstration of how the
method works, but since each adjacent point on the curve
cannot be graphically represented easily, a range with a
&#34;weighted&#34; average size attack is shown (even
though actual computation was performed for each point on the
curve). The expected deaths per year within the range
considered also applies to the RL curve. </p>
<center>
<h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">The Composite Aggressor/Initiator Reluctance Level
Curve<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>In Nukefix the Reluctance Level Curves for the
individual nations are presented, then the Composite
Aggressor/Initiator Reluctance Level Curve is shown. </p>
<p>The RL curves for the individual nuclear weapon nations
combine to produce the Composite Aggressor/Initiator RL
Curve. This curve represents the average proclivities for a
single nuclear weapon nation to initiate attacks of the
stated size or larger.</p>
<p>If each of 9 equally capable nuclear weapon nations were
to possess these proclivities, they would present the same
total level of risk (2,369,886 DPY) as the present 9 nuclear
weapon nations. </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/comrl.gif" width="644" height="484"/>
 </p>
</center><p>By looking at the above curve one can clearly
see the levels of restraint required at each level during the
period under consideration, even if deterrence
&#34;works.&#34; For example, at startup with 9 nations by
RIGHT clicking on the curve to get its values, one can see
that the curve passes through the following coordinates:
13,000 RL, 500+ million deaths; 5,000 RL, 329+ million
deaths; 2,175 RL, 200+ million deaths; 1,500 RL, 100+ million
deaths; 500 RL, 6.7+ million deaths; 320 RL 1+ million
deaths. </p>
<p>If an advocate of deterrence had seen such a curve, he or
she might well have been tempted to comment, &#34;See
deterrence works. Look at the very high levels of restraint
that each nation, on average, is presenting. Don&#39;t you see
that this curve supports the respected political scientist
Kenneth Waltz&#39;s statements in 1988 and 1993 that, &#39;the
probability of major war among states having nuclear weapons
approaches zero [<cite>Forecast &amp; Solution,</cite> p.
13].&#39;&#34;</p>
<p>Yet, in sharp contrast to such optimism, the curve
reflects a public health menace that, over the long term,
would tend to produce 2,369,886 deaths per year. Indeed, if
so-called deterrence were to contain risk of death to low
levels, of say, roughly 23,699 deaths per year, its RL values
would, on average, need to be fully 100 times higher, as can
be seen in the same graph by setting Composite RL on the main
screen to 29,500 at startup [23,699=2,369,886/100;
29,500=295*100].</p>
<p>The Composite RL Curve provides a sound theoretical
approach that systematically accounts for probability and
severity of occurrence in wars. The curve provides an
alternative to idiosyncratic analyses that often focus on one
war (or type of war) at a time, but which do little to
explain the likelihood of, the consequences of, or the
methods for preventing future wars. </p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#006666">The United States, Hit By Risk<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h2>
</center><p>Previous sections of Nukefix have provided ways
to assess the average deaths per year (DPY) created by
nuclear weapon nations. The upcoming worksheet makes it
possible to evaluate how that risk would tend to be
distributed among individual nations. </p>
<p>Specifically, if you are a citizen of the United States
(or any other nuclear power), you can easily assess the
public health risk that nuclear weapons pose for you.</p>
<p>In the upper section of the worksheet, the highlighted
percentage figures indicate the percent of DPY received by
each nation. The values shown at startup are arbitrary. By
clicking on them, you can easily change them, according to
your own assessment. </p>
<p>The vertically positioned nations at the top of the
worksheet refer to the initiating nations that developed the
risk. Each column, for the particular initiating nation,
reflects how the percentages of risk are distributed among
nations. These percentages sum to 100%, and the user can
readily change them. </p>
<p>The rows show the nations receiving the risk. The red
horizontal lines are intended to make the rows easier to
read. The red lines do not imply groupings of nations. The
nations are alphabetically listed. </p>
<p>At the bottom section of the worksheet the &#34;DPY
Delivered&#34;, &#34;DPY Received&#34;, and &#34;Deaths
per 100,000 received&#34; are shown. The &#34;DPYs
Delivered&#34; are substantially the same as are indicated
in the &#34;U&#34; command graphs, except that in the
worksheet 10 nuclear weapon nations are always shown (not 9
nations as at startup, or a fewer nations as the user can
select on the main screen). </p>
<p>The &#34;DPYs Received&#34; result from the &#34;DPYs
Delivered&#34; for each nuclear nation being multiplied by
the percentage figures at the top of the worksheet and the
results summed. </p>
<p>Risk for &#34;Deaths per 100,000&#34; are calculated
based on the population of the recipient nation and its
&#34;DPY Received.&#34; Since the category
&#34;non-nuclear&#34; nation can refer to several different
nations of various population sizes, no &#34;Deaths per
100,000&#34; are shown for this category. Nation-X
substantially refers to Iran.</p>
<p>In the worksheet in the &#34;Deaths per 100,000&#34;
column you will see a comparable public health risk, such as
&#34;Heart Disease at 287&#34; deaths per 100,000
population listed. Sometimes this text (for example,
&#34;Total Worldwide War Deaths for WWI and WWII combined at
66.8&#34;) is cropped short, where space did not permit its
full listing. But these public health risks can be found
fully-listed via the &#34;D&#34; (Death) command in
Nukefix. </p>
<p>The &#34;U&#34; command graphs for the RL Curves showed
the expected deaths per year (DPY) that each nuclear weapon
nation would produce under the illustrated conditions. Those
DPYs would ultimately be received by other nations. This is
explicitly shown. At the bottom of the worksheet, Total
&#34;DPY Delivered&#34; equals total &#34;DPY
Received.&#34; </p>

</center><p><strong>&#34;HIT BY RISK&#34; WORKSHEET #1,
WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE UNITED STATES:</strong> We can also
tell a great deal about the relative risk of nuclear weapons
deaths to which the U.S. is now exposed in the post-Cold War
era. For example, the worksheet at startup shows the U.S.
having approximately a 246 death rate per 100,000 (a rate
between Cancer at 206 and Heart Disease at 287). </p>
<p>In 1945 the United States experienced its highest death
rate from war during any 50 year period in its history (WWI
and WWII). Its war deaths then averaged 6.8 deaths per
100,000 [<a href="http://www.nukefix.org/forecast.html">F&amp;S</a>, p. 129]. <strong>The risk to the U.S. of
nuclear weapons deaths from initiating attacks alone, at a
246 rate, is fully 36 TIMES GREATER THAN THE U.S. WAR-TIME
CONDITIONS DURING THE WWI/WWII PERIOD</strong>
[36.1=246/6.8]. Yet, this high risk is occurring in a
post-Cold War era that is ostensibly viewed by most of the
public as being substantially peaceful.</p>
<p>In the management of nations, the precise difficulty is
that a risk level, such as Cancer or Heart Disease, which we
are accustomed to in our own lives, becomes unacceptably
catastrophic when we allow the same level of risk to occur in
the nuclear weapons problem. While we cannot know with
precision when the event will occur, if the United States
were to experience a 682,937 &#34;DPY Received,&#34; as
suggested in the worksheet at startup, then at 20, 40, or 60
year intervals, it would be perfectly logical for it to
experience nuclear attacks causing respectively 13.6, 27.3,
or 40.9 million deaths at these intervals [20, 40, and 60
multiplied by 682,937].</p>
<p>We can also view the net effect of the nuclear weapons
system for each particular nation in the case presented. For
example, in the screen snapshot we see the United States
delivering 555,372 deaths per year on average, yet receiving
638,937 deaths per year. The net disadvantage for the United
States in this case would be 83,565 deaths per year 83,565=
638,937 - 555,372. The risk received was greater than the
risk developed.</p>
<center><h2><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#006666">Two of the objectives of arms limitations<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h2>
</center><p>At the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis 37 years
ago Russia had approximately 481 strategic nuclear warheads.
</p>
<p>START II proposes 3,000 to 3,500 deliverable strategic
warheads. START III proposes 2,000 to 2,500.</p>
<p><strong>&#34;Hit By Risk&#34; Worksheet #2</strong>
shows expected outcomes, other things being equal, at limits
from 10,700 to 50 warheads per nation. At each level of
warhead limits, estimated risk of death worldwide, and for an
individual nation (which you can select), are shown in terms
of deaths per year (DPY) and average deaths per 100,000
population. When considering low levels of nuclear warheads,
keep in mind that a single Trident submarine has 192 warheads
(24 missiles, 8 warheads per missile).</p>
<p>For attacks of 100+ and 200+ million deaths, estimated
median years to occurrence and years within which there would
be a one in five chance of occurrence (20%) are shown in
worksheet #2.</p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">This is one of the most important sections of
the program.<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
<p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/riskhit2.gif" width="644" height="484"/>
 </p>
</center><p>At startup conditions, with 10 nations, we see
that, so long as warhead limits are at 2,000 or higher, risk
of death caused by nuclear weapons tends to be in excess of
approximately 150 deaths per 100,000 for the United States.
And, worldwide it tends to be in excess of approximately 26.1
deaths per 100,000 population annually.</p>
<p>Moreover, worldwide, at the 2,000 level, there would tend
to be a one in five chance of a nuclear attack of 100+
million deaths occurring within 44.5 years. Not until
warheads get to very low levels, such as 50 per nation on the
worksheet is the risk of 100+ million death attacks
substantially eliminated. Attacks of 200+ million deaths
become very unlikely in the near term once warheads reach a
250 limit.</p>
<p>You can explore numerous other scenarios. Those that
typically are most beneficial, not only reduce the number of
warheads, but also reduce probability (RL) on the main
screen, or in the RL Curves in the &#34;U&#34; command. You
can also change percentages for DPY distribution on worksheet
#1 to reflect your personal assessment of real-world
conditions.</p>
<p>With startup conditions and 10 nations selected, the
citizens of the nuclear superpowers, Russia and the United
States, receive approximately 5.4 to 6.1 times the risk of
aggressor-caused death by comparison to the average person on
earth [5.4=217/40.4; 6.1=246/40.4]. At a worldwide death rate
of 40.4 per 100,000 annually, aggressor-caused nuclear weapon
deaths (not counting retaliation and secondary deaths) would
be substantially identical to the worldwide risk posed by all
sides in the WWII era at 40.3 deaths per 100,000.</p>
<p>Based on startup data, we see in worksheet #2 that, other
things being equal, dramatic reductions in risk of death do
not usually tend to occur until nations drop to very low
levels of warheads. There are two key reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, nuclear warheads, even at low levels, have
phenomenal death dealing properties. Second, the average
lethality of individual warheads increases as number of
warheads are reduced, because, on average, warheads are
targeted on higher density populations. The marginal deaths
at the periphery are substantially removed.</p>
<p>This increased lethality as warheads are reduced is
evident when one considers the second worksheet in the
&#34;T&#34; (Treaty) command, the &#34;War-Room
Plans&#34;, or Tsipis&#39; study of a &#34;small&#34; 239
warhead attack on the United States (Nukefix, page 3).</p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">Worksheet #2:<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
</center><p>At a 10,700 warhead limit the U.S. would tend to
experience a 245 nuclear weapons death rate per 100,000 (a
rate between Cancer at 206 and Heart Disease at 287). </p>
<p>Based on startup conditions in worksheet #2, it appears
that it would be fraudulent to proclaim START II levels at
3,500 intercontinental warheads mounted on missiles or
aircraft by the year 2007, are sufficient to dramatically
reduce risk of nuclear weapon deaths. Under Nukefix&#39;s
baseline conditions with 10 nations selected, the &#34;Hit
By Risk&#34; pages shows that a 3,500 warhead limit (by
comparison to a 10,700 limit) only reduce the risk of nuclear
weapons death by about 23% for the United States. </p>
<p>This reduction would leave the U.S. with a long-term
average 522,699 aggressor-caused direct nuclear weapon deaths
and an average nuclear weapon death rate of 188 annually per
100,000 population. Thus, START II could readily present the
U.S. with a risk of nuclear weapons deaths that would be
fully 91% as great as the risk of death by Cancer [91%=188
nuclear rate/ 206 Cancer rate.]</p>
<p>However, the shock impact for nuclear attack is far more
adverse than Cancer deaths because in the nuclear case the
522,699 deaths per year are expressed infrequently at
intervals of, for example, 20, 40, or 60 years respectively
producing 10.5, 20.9, 31.4 million deaths at each event
[10.5, 20.9, 31.4 million = 20, 40, or 60 times 522,699].
Moreover, at a START II limit of 3,500 warheads, there would
also remain a one in five chance worldwide of an attack of
greater than 100 million deaths within 40.2 years.</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#003300">In summary, a 3,500 START II warhead limit in the
post-Cold War era may well have a propensity to present a
risk of death for the United States nearly as great as one of
the top public health risks: Cancer. And, worldwide the
chance of enormous attacks of 100+ million deaths would
remain a serious threat. In the spirit of &#34;The Emperor
Wears No Clothes,&#34; what on earth are the militaries,
governments, and arms control experts thinking?<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h3>
<center><h2><!--mstheme--><SPAN color="#006666">The Logic of Nukefix.<!--mstheme--></SPAN></h2>
</center><p>A contribution, unique to Nukefix versions 2.02
and later, is that the program makes it possible in the
post-Cold War era for the user to assess and reduce the risk
that would be RECEIVED from aggressor-caused nuclear attacks
worldwide, by comparison to known public health risks (such
as Heart Disease, Cancer, etc.). In a nub, the logic used in
Nukefix can be followed quite precisely, as shown in the
following. </p>
<p><strong>Risk Produced:<br/></strong>The risk produced is
established by evaluating destructive capabilities of
warheads, using Nukefix&#39;s &#34;M&#34; (Multiple Blasts)
command. The results from that section of the program can be
validated using a publicly available computer program
prepared for <a href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/hew/Library/Nukesims.html">
 Director Defense Nuclear Agency (We.zip) </a> available
through The High Energy Weapons Archive. Then in the
&#34;War-Room Plans&#34;, extensive worldwide population
densities for nations where the warheads would potentially be
delivered is used to assess the maximum size attacks that
individual nations would be capable of producing. </p>
<p>For the superpowers, the annual probability of initiating
maximum size attacks is represented as being minuscule. But
having established an expected maximum size attack, the user
(using Nukefix&#39;s &#34;U&#34; command) can define the
probability for all size attacks, from the smallest to the
largest, that each nation could potentially carry out. The
Reluctance Curves that are established in this fashion show
the estimated restraint each nation would exercise before
initiating nuclear attacks of the different available sizes.
</p>
<p>The &#34;U&#34; (Ultimate) command uses each size
attack, and its associated probability, for each nation to
compute the long-term expected deaths per year produced by
that nation. The program then sums these figures to get
worldwide risk. Expressing long-term nuclear weapons risk in
terms of deaths per year serves to illustrate the expected
public health risk, as is done with Cancer, Heart Disease, et
cetera. It also provides a single currency by which the risk
presented by &#34;small&#34; and &#34;large&#34; nuclear
powers can be compared. The user can either accept the
baseline case presented in Nukefix at startup, or alter the
component values to preference via mouse clicks and simple
entries. At this point in the program the risk produce is
established. </p>
<p><strong>Risk Received:<br/></strong>On the &#34;Hit By
Risk&#34; page, the user in worksheets #1 and #2 can see the
degree to which individual nations would tend to RECEIVE that
risk. The &#34;Hit By Risk&#34; worksheet #1 shows a grid
of percentages for the ten nations producing the risk and the
same ten (plus a category for non-nuclear nations) receiving
the risk. By identifying potential adversaries for each
nation and assigning a percent of its produced risk that
would be received in each potentially adversarial nation, the
user can find the risk RECEIVED for each nation. </p>
