    <h1>Open Source Projects Receive Funding to Reclaim the Public Internet</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincolumn">
          
          <p>It is wonderful to see the growing number of people working on digital commons, inventing and improving technologies to the benefit of all humanity. 42 of such projects have been selected for funding in the October call of the NGI Zero Commons Fund. In terms of applications, it was the largest call round in NGI Zero&#39;s life time. And we&#39;d like to take this space to thank <em>all</em> applicants for their contributions to an internet for people rather than for profit.</p>
          <p>The selected projects all contribute, one way or another, to the mission of the Commons Fund: reclaiming the public nature of the internet. For example, there are people working on interesting open hardware projects such as the tablet <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/MNT-Reform-Touch/">MNT Reform Touch</a> and the <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/Solar-FemtoTX/">Solar FemtoTX motherboard</a> — a collaborative effort to create an ultra-low power motherboard that can run on solar power. <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/MOTIS">MOTIS</a> enables door-to-door real-time routing for European Public Transport. <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/bcachefs-crypto-API/">bcachefs</a> readies itself as the next generation filesystem for Linux, improving performance, scalability and reliability when compared to legacy filesystems and <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/KDEPlasma-gestures/">KDE Plasma Gestures</a> will add multi-touch and stroke gestures to the Plasma Desktop. <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/LiberaForms-Edu">LiberaForms</a>, the only forms solution known to offer end-to-end-encryption out of the box, will develop new features and improve its UX to make it even more compelling for for instance educational use cases. There are other educational initiatives supported, such as <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/ClassQuiz">ClassQuiz</a> allows schools to quiz their students without privacy concerns, <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/ImmersiveXP">Federating pedagogical immersive experiences</a> which is building a framework for playful learning content in enhanced reality (XR) and <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/FlockXR">Flock XR</a> — an innovative and kid-friendly 3D visual creativity and coding tool. <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/LLM2FPGA/">LLM2FPGA</a> aims to enable running open source LLMs locally on programmable chips (&#34;FPGAs&#34;) using a fully open-source toolchain. <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/Podlibre">Podlibre</a> is dedicated software to make podcasts, while <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/PeerTube-for-Institutions/">PeerTube for institutions</a> will make it easier for organisations to use the popular free, decentralized video-on-demand and live-streaming platform PeerTube — with another project enhancing its <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/PeerTube-Livechat-UX">livechat</a> capablities to integrate public and private messaging capabilities. The Open Terms Archive offers <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/Modular-OTA/">public tracking of the evolution of terms and conditions</a> to facilitate democratic oversight. And that&#39;s just a small sample of the wide range of important contributions being worked on. Read on to meet all the projects selected in this funding round, or check out the complete <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/project/current.html">overview of projects</a> currently funded by NLnet.</p>
