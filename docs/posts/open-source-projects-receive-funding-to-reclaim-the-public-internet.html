    <h1>Open Source Projects Receive Funding to Reclaim the Public Internet</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincolumn">
          
          <p>It is wonderful to see the growing number of people working on digital commons, inventing and improving technologies to the benefit of all humanity. 42 of such projects have been selected for funding in the October call of the NGI Zero Commons Fund. In terms of applications, it was the largest call round in NGI Zero&#39;s life time. And we&#39;d like to take this space to thank <em>all</em> applicants for their contributions to an internet for people rather than for profit.</p>
          <p>The selected projects all contribute, one way or another, to the mission of the Commons Fund: reclaiming the public nature of the internet. For example, there are people working on <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/MNT-Reform-Touch/">MNT Reform Touch</a> (an open hardware tablet device) and the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/Solar-FemtoTX/">Solar FemtoTX motherboard</a> — a collaborative effort to create an ultra-low power motherboard that can run on solar power. The Open Terms Archive offers <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/Modular-OTA/">public tracking of the evolution of terms and conditions</a> to facilitate democratic oversight. <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/LLM2FPGA/">LLM2FPGA</a> aims to enable running open source LLMs locally on FPGAs using a fully open-source toolchain. <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/bcachefs-crypto-API/">bcachefs</a> readies itself as the next generation filesystem for Linux, improving performance, scalability and reliability when compared to legacy filesystems and <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/KDEPlasma-gestures/">KDE Plasma Gestures</a> will add multi-touch and stroke gestures to the Plasma Desktop. And that&#39;s just a small sample of the wide range of important contributions being worked on. Read on to meet all the projects selected in this funding round.</p>

              <summary>How do I find out which call round I applied to?</summary>You can see which call round you applied to by checking the application number assigned to the project when you submitted the proposal. The number starts with the year and month of the call, so 2024-10- in the case of the October 2024 call. You see that same number featured in the emails we send you (It should not happen, but if you did apply to another call and did not hear anything, do contact us)</details>
