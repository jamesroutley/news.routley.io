  <p>With macOS 26, Apple has announced a dramatically new look to their UI: Liquid Glass. Solid material icon elements give way to softer, shinier, glassier icons. The rounded rectangle became slightly more rounded, and Apple eliminated the ability for icon elements to extend beyond the icon rectangle (as seen in the current icons for GarageBand, Photo Booth, Dictionary, etc.).</p><p>With this release being one of the most dramatic visual overhauls of macOS&#39;s design, I wanted to begin a collection chronicling the evolution of the system icons over the years. I&#39;ve been rolling these out on social media over the past week and will continue to add to and update this collection slowly over the summer. Enjoy!</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Beta icons won’t be included. Occasionally, an icon may receive slight design tweaks during the beta cycle, but these temporary variations won’t be part of the collection.</p>
