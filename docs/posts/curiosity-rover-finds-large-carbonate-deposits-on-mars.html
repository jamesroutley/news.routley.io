</div><p>Research from NASA&#39;s Curiosity rover has found evidence of a carbon cycle on ancient Mars, bringing scientists closer to an answer on whether the red planet was ever capable of supporting life.</p>


										    
																																	<p>Lead author Dr. Ben Tutolo, Ph.D., an associate professor with the Department of Earth, Energy and Environment in the Faculty of Science at the University of Calgary, is a participating scientist on the NASA Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover team.</p>
<p>The team is working to understand climate transitions and habitability on ancient Mars as Curiosity explores Gale Crater.</p>
<p>The paper, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado9966" target="_blank">published</a> in the journal <i>Science</i>, reveals that data from three of Curiosity&#39;s drill sites had siderite, an iron carbonate material, within sulfate-rich layers of Mount Sharp in Gale Crater.</p>
<p>&#34;The discovery of large carbon deposits in Gale Crater represents both a surprising and important breakthrough in our understanding of the geologic and atmospheric evolution of Mars,&#34; says Tutolo.</p>
<p>Reaching the strata, he says, was a long-term goal of the Mars Science Laboratory mission.</p>

<p>&#34;The abundance of highly soluble salts in these rocks and similar deposits mapped over much of Mars has been used as evidence of the &#39;great drying&#39; of Mars during its dramatic shift from a warm and wet early Mars to its current, cold and dry state,&#34; says Tutolo.</p>
<p>Sedimentary carbonate has long been predicted to have formed under the CO<sub>2</sub>-rich ancient Martian atmosphere, but Tutolo says identifications had previously been sparse.</p>
<p>NASA&#39;s Curiosity rover landed on Mars on Aug. 5, 2012, and has <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity/location-map/" target="_blank">traveled more than 34 kilometers</a> on the Martian surface.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>The discovery of carbonate suggests that the atmosphere contained enough <a href="https://phys.org/tags/carbon+dioxide/" rel="tag">carbon dioxide</a> to support <a href="https://phys.org/tags/liquid+water/" rel="tag">liquid water</a> existing on the planet&#39;s surface. As the atmosphere thinned, the carbon dioxide transformed into rock form.</p>
<p>NASA says future missions and analysis of other sulfate-rich areas on Mars could confirm the findings and help to better understand the planet&#39;s early history and how it transformed as its atmosphere was lost.</p>
<p>Tutolo says scientists are ultimately trying to determine whether Mars was ever capable of supporting life—and the latest paper brings them closer to an answer.</p>
<p>&#34;It tells us that the planet was habitable and that the models for habitability are correct,&#34; he says.</p>
<p>&#34;The broader implications are the planet was habitable up until this time, but then, as the CO<sub>2</sub> that had been warming the planet started to precipitate as siderite, it likely impacted Mars&#39; ability to stay warm.</p>
<p>&#34;The question looking forward is how much of this CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere was actually sequestered? Was that potentially a reason we began to lose habitability?&#34;</p>
<p>The latest research, he says, fits with his ongoing work on Earth—trying to turn anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> into carbonates as a climate change solution.</p>
<p>&#34;Learning about the mechanisms of making these minerals on Mars helps us to better understand how we can do it here,&#34; he says. &#34;Studying the collapse of Mars&#39; warm and wet early days also tells us that habitability is a very fragile thing.&#34;</p>
<p>Tutolo says it&#39;s clear that small changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> can lead to huge changes in the ability of the planet to harbor life.</p>
<p>&#34;The most remarkable thing about Earth is that it&#39;s habitable and it has been for at least four billion years,&#34; he adds. &#34;Something happened to Mars that didn&#39;t happen to Earth.&#34;</p>
