<p><strong>UPDATE 10/12: The update to the Paint app for Windows 11 that includes Paint Cocreator </strong><strong>is now rolling out to Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel (version 11.2309.20.0 or higher<span dir="ltr">)</span>. </strong></p>
<p>Hello Windows Insiders,</p>
<p>Today we are beginning to roll <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2023/09/26/the-most-personal-windows-11-experience-begins-rolling-out-today/">out an update for the Paint app</a> to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels (version 11.2309.20.0 or higher). With this update, we are excited to introduce Paint Cocreator, a new AI-powered experience powered by DALL-E that helps you create amazing artwork in Paint by describing in a few words what you’d like to create. You can optionally select an art style, and when you click Create, Paint Cocreator will generate three variations of artwork for you to choose from. Select any of them to add to the canvas to start creating!</p>
<p>We will be rolling out access slowly at first, so when you get the update, you must first join the waitlist by signing in with your Microsoft account and clicking on the new Cocreator button in the toolbar. You will get an email notification when you are in the preview, and we will give you 50 credits to get started. Each credit lets you generate a new set of images.</p>
