<p>I was just applying for a role with <a href="https://www.canonical.com">Canonical</a>, makers of the Ubuntu Linux distribution along with other tools and products. Honestly, I was tempted not to complete it when I saw this section.</p>

<p>It asks for my college GPA and how well I did in two academic concentrations in <em>high school</em>. My answers are in the image.</p>
<p><b>College GPA</b>: I said this is not relevant unless you’re focusing on recent grads with no job history. I was on the Dean’s List for the bulk of my college career, had a 3.85 in my major courses, but I don’t tell them. Why? Because it’s not relevant. People grow, mature, find their calling… and many do most of that after college.</p>
<p>If you’re more than 5 years out of college, your professional resume is more important. By the time I was 5 years out of college, I had tech edited “Marketing Online for Dummies,” was an MPAA accredited entertainment journalist, worked as a Courseware Developer for Nortel, and was the Senior Editor for IMDb.com (which had been acquired by Amazon about a year earlier). And those are just some of the things I achieved.</p>
<p><b>High School</b>: I got kicked out of AP English for insubordination in high school. The difference between my high-school performance in English classes and professional accomplishments as a writer is <strong>vast</strong>. On top of that, it’s possible that “cannot recall” will be taken as a sign of high school being far off in the distant mists of memory and lead to unconscious age bias.</p>
<p><b>These are standard questions in their application:</b> I looked and they’re asking them on every application, even for roles requiring significant professional experience.</p>
<p>It just seems like someone in Canonical HR is not competent enough to know that these questions are not only irrelevant, but could indicate age bias.</p>
<p>Maybe they didn’t do well in language studies in high school.</p>
