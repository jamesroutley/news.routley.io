<h4>What I Did</h4>



<ul>
<li>Started a new job at <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/">ElevenLabs</a>
<ul>
<li>Pre-onboarding</li>



<li>Onboarding</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Worked on Python problems on Codewars</li>
</ul>



<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>So after months of studying, applying, and interviewing, in December I accepted an offer to join ElevenLabs as a Customer Support Specialist. I took a few weeks to relax and spend time with family over the holidays, and started my new job on Monday, January 5, <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/day-0-welcome-to-the-winter-2-2025-batch-of-rc/">a year after I started my batch at the Recurse Center</a>.</li>



<li>So far I’m enjoying the work, learning a lot, and intrigued by the tech. ElevenLabs builds AI audio models and software that powers voice agents and creative projects, and even gives people their voices back via voice cloning. It’s been moving to hear their stories and work on tickets with speech therapists that are helping their clients with this technology. </li>



<li>I’ve been thinking about what i want from my tech study/dev blog moving forward. I have some goals in mind, but I’ll be going at an easy pace, since life is busy and full right now, in a good way.</li>
