    <h1>Ask HN: What can you realistically manufacture in your garage?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Given a two-car garage, what can a small team (2-3 people) manufacture that can be sold for some amount of profit? Imagine access to capital of 20-50k USD at maximum.<p>Interesting would be items whose manufacture could be automatized to some extent, but this is not necessary.</p><p>I am not particularly interested in the legality of this at the moment. But safety considerations could be important.</p></td></div></div>
