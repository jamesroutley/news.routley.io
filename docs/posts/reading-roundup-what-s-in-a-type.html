<p><a href="https://williamjbowman.com/resources/wjb2024-ethical-compiler.pdf" rel="external" target="_blank">The Ethical Compiler</a>: about the fallacy of deriving “what ought to be” from “what is”,
and the importance of expressing/capturing intention in the language.
The first time I’ve seen a <a href="https://f.duriansoftware.com/@joe/113364795231040676" rel="external" target="_blank">toot quoted in a paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There must be compiler developers whom the language standard protects but does not bind, alongside developers whom the language standard binds but does not protect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(A small parallel to this paper: the Go style guide recommends expressing test assertions as <code>got</code> compared to <code>want</code>, by those names; i.e. an explicit “is” and “ought to be”.)</p>
<p>Related work, mostly in the citations of the above:</p>
<p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7163211" rel="external" target="_blank">The Correctness-Security Gap</a>,
calling out that the (C/C++) abstract machine does not capture important security properties (side channels, uncleared memory).
The source code may express an intention that is not captured in the formal semantics of the language - it “does not bind” the compiler’s behavior.</p>
<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3242744.3242755" rel="external" target="_blank">Ghosts of Departed Proofs</a> (public <a href="https://kataskeue.com/gdp.pdf" rel="external" target="_blank">PDF here</a>),
on types that capture additional properties of the value. Rust’s <code>NonZeroUsize</code> is a nice recent example.
Another take on the same idea: <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/" rel="external" target="_blank">Parse, don’t validate</a>.</p>
<p>The theory underlying these is <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/ProofObjects.html" rel="external" target="_blank">The Curry-Howard Correspondence</a>:
a type is a proposition, and an instance of the type is a proof of the proposition.
I think “Ghosts” and “Parse” show the useful aspects, but don’t require diving in to the underlying theory;
it can be argued that the theory side <a href="https://liamoc.net/forest/loc-000S/index.xml" rel="external" target="_blank">isn’t very useful in engineering contexts</a>.</p>
