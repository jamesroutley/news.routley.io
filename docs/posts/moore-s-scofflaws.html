    <h1>Moore&#39;s Scofflaws</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div id="content"><p>Years ago, Jeff Bezos famously quipped that &#34;your margin is my opportunity.&#34;
This was of course aimed not at Amazon’s customers, but rather its
competitors, and it was deadly serious: customers of AWS in those bygone years
will fondly remember that every re:Invent brought with it another round of
price cuts.  This era did not merely reflect Bezos’s relentless execution, but
also a disposition towards who should reap the reward of advances in
underlying technology: Amazon believed (if implicitly) that improvements at
the foundations of computing (e.g., in transistor density, core count, DRAM
density, storage density, etc.) should reflect themselves in lower prices for
consumers rather than higher margins for suppliers.</p><p>Price cuts are no longer a re:Invent staple, having been replaced by a regular
Amazon tradition of a different flavor:  cutting depreciation (and therefore
increasing earnings) by
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/amazon_q4_2023/">extending the effective
life of their servers</a>.  (These announcements are understandably much more
subdued, as &#34;my depreciation is my margin opportunity&#34; doesn’t have quite the
same ring to it.)</p><p>As compute needs have grown and price cuts have become an increasingly distant
memory, some have questioned their sky-high cloud bills, wondering if they
should in fact be owning their compute instead of renting it.  When we started
Oxide, we knew from operating our own public cloud what those economics looked
like — and we knew that over time others of a particular scale would come to
the same realization that they would be better off not giving their margin
away by renting compute.  (Though it’s safe to say that we did not predict
that it would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a30vFpSaoZg">DHH leading the
charge</a>!)</p><p>Owning one’s own cloud sounds great, but there is a bit that’s unsaid: <strong>what
about the software?</strong>  Software is essential for elastic, automated
infrastructure:  hardware alone does not a cloud make!  Unfortunately, the
traditional server vendors do not help here: because of a PC-era divide in how
systems are delivered, customers are told to look elsewhere for any and all
system software.  This divide is problematic on several levels.  First, it
impedes the hardware/software co-design that we (and, famously,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAfTXYa36f4">others</a>!) believe is essential to
deliver the best possible product.  Second, it leads to
<a href="https://twitter.com/_sysengineer/status/1487149172637712386">infamous finger
pointing</a> when the whole thing doesn’t work.  But there is also a thorny
economic problem:  when your hardware and your software don’t come from the
same provider, <strong>to whom should go the spoils of better hardware?</strong></p><p>To someone who has just decided to buy their hardware out of their frustration
with renting it, the answer feels obvious:  whoever owns the hardware should
naturally benefit from its advances!  Unfortunately, the enterprise software
vendor delivering your infrastructure often has other ideas — and because
their software is neither rented nor bought, but rather comes from the
hinterlands of software licensing, they have broad latitude as to how it is
priced and used.  In particular, this allows them to charge based on the
hardware that you run it on — to have <strong>per-core software licensing.</strong></p><p>This galling practice isn’t new (and is in fact as old as symmetric
multiprocessing systems), but it has taken on new dimensions in the era of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiplet">chiplets</a> and packaging innovation: the
advances that your next CPU has over your current one are very likely to be
expressed in core count.  Per-core licensing allows a third party — who
neither made the significant investment in developing the next generation of
microprocessor nor paid for the part themselves — to exact a tax on improved
infrastructure.  (And this tax can be
<a href="https://news.vmware.com/company/cpu-pricing-model-update-feb-2020">shockingly
brazen</a>!) Couple this with
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">the
elimination of perpetual licensing</a>, and software costs can potentially absorb
the entire gain from a next-generation CPU, leaving a disincentive to run
newer, more efficient infrastructure.  As an industry, we have come to accept
this practice, but we shouldn’t: in the go-go era of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling">Dennard scaling</a> (when clock
rates rose at a blistering rate), software vendors never would have been
allowed to get away with charging by the gigahertz; we should not allow them to
feel so emboldened to charge by core count now!</p><p>If it needs to be said, we have taken a different approach at Oxide:  when you
buy the <a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/the-cloud-computer">Oxide cloud computer</a>, <strong>all of the
software to run it is included</strong>.  This includes all of the software necessary
to run the rack as elastic infrastructure:
<a href="https://oxide.computer/product/compute">virtual compute</a>,
<a href="https://oxide.computer/product/storage">virtual storage</a>,
<a href="https://oxide.computer/product/networking">virtual networking</a>.
(And yes, it’s all open source — which unfortunately demands the immediate
clarification that it’s <a href="https://opensource.org/osd/"><em>actually</em> open source</a>
rather than <a href="https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2018/12/16/a-eula-in-foss-clothing/">pretend open
source</a>.) When we add a new feature to our software, there is no licensing
enablement or other such nuisance — the feature just comes with the next
update.  And what happens when AMD releases a new CPU with twice the core
count?  The new sled running the new CPU runs along your existing rack — you’re not paying more than the cost of the new sled itself.  This gives the
dividends of Moore’s Law (or
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuvp-e4ztC0">Wright’s Law</a>!) to whom they
rightfully belong:  the users of compute.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
