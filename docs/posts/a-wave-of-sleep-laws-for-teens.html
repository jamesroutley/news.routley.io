<p>Ezra Klein <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/podcasts/ezra-klein-podcast-transcript-lisa-damour.html">recently interviewed</a> psychologist <a href="https://twitter.com/LDamour?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Lisa Damour</a> about teen depression where she honed in on the contributing factor of declining sleep levels. It’s an argument I hadn’t heard coherently expressed previously above the ongoing debate around social platforms and smartphones.  </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think one thing that we don’t talk nearly enough about are the data on worsening sleep in teenagers because, certainly, starting right in that same time frame — 2011, 2012, 2013 — you see this incredibly steep climb in the data on the proportion of teenagers who sleep fewer than seven hours a night. And it maps, actually, very cleanly onto the data about worsening mental health problems. And we also know that sleep disruption and suicide are closely connected.</p>
<cite>Lisa Damour</cite></blockquote>



<p>I think Lisa is referring to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/14_0383.htm#Results">this CDC report</a>.  It’s short, worth reading and quite concerning. </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sleepdiplomat?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Matthew Walker</a>, everyone’s (including my) favourite sleep scientist has also argued for more teen sleep, on the basis of academic results (although presumably this correlates closely to mental health). </p>

<p>Last year, California <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/us/california-later-school-start-times.html">introduced new legislation</a> that protects most high school students from having to start class before 8.30am. Miami has just followed with <a href="https://www.mysuncoast.com/2023/05/17/desantis-signs-later-school-start-times-into-law/">a similar law</a> (albeit not coming into effect until 2026). New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and the Virgin Islands are also considering. This seems like the start of a trend which won’t stop in the US…</p>
