                            <p><a href="https://www.lightandsound.design/">Light and Sound Design</a> is a treasure. One of the few remaining DIY spaces in the city, it features a vintage sound system sourced in part from <a href="http://magick.city/">Magick City</a> (RIP) and custom light installations built by the volunteers that run the space.</p>

<p>I’ve been to <a href="https://brian.abelson.live/shows/">many shows at L&amp;SD</a>, but only recently got the honor of DJ’ing there in support of <a href="https://www.willshore.com/">Will Shore’s</a> group, pedestrian, a 10-piece improvisational group which he led via conduction, a<a href="https://www.conduction.us/">n interactive method of conducting developed by Butch Morris</a> in which the players have an equal role in guiding the direction of their playing.</p>

<p><a href="https://brian.abelson.live/log/2025/10/25/lsd-mix-part-1.html">My mix</a> before their set aimed to set a mellow vibe centered on percussion-forward tracks around 80bpm. <a href="https://brian.abelson.live/log/2025/10/25/lsd-mix-part-2.html">Part two here.</a></p>
