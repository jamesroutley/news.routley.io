I’m an engineer and product manager, like many of you. In 2013, I landed my first job in Big Tech (at Google), and my career took off. Over the next 10 years, I moved into management and leadership roles, where I learned about how the sausage is made when it comes to interviews, offers, and talent assessments. Now, I’m a chief product officer, and I moonlight as a career coach to help people unlock outsized career opportunities.</p><p>My goal in sharing this Minimum Viable Interview Prep (MVIP) process is to arm you with the employer and interviewer perspective so that you can build confidence in your job search. I’m passionate about helping people with job searching because I know how much the right role can set you up for success in your career and financial life.</p><p>First rounds are designed to filter out candidates who are unlikely to be a contender for an offer.</p><p><span>Interviews are</span><em> very</em><span> expensive for employers (time, coordination, resources, opportunity cost). The singular goal of a first-round interview (from the employer’s perspective) is to determine if they want to invest in additional interviews with that candidate.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png" width="1408" height="1056" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1056,&#34;width&#34;:1408,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:183898,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>By the time you get to a first-round interview, you likely have already:</p><ul><li><p>Applied or been referred by an employee</p></li><li><p>Spoken to a recruiter or HR representative (phone screen)</p></li></ul><p>If you pass a first-round interview, the next step is often second rounds (another single interview), or even final-round interviews (three to six interviews back-to-back in one day or split over two days).</p><p><strong>Most first-round interviews in tech are:</strong></p><ul><li><p>30 minutes to 1 hour</p></li><li><p>on the phone or via video chat</p></li><li><p>with just one interviewer (not panel-style)</p></li><li><p>conducted by a hiring manager, peer, or another person familiar with the role</p></li></ul><p><strong>The standard time breakdown is typically:</strong></p><ul><li><p>10% intro</p></li><li><p>70% questions from the interviewer</p></li><li><p>20% questions from the candidate</p></li></ul><p><strong>For a 45-minute interview, this looks like:</strong></p><ul><li><p>3-5 minutes intros</p></li><li><p>35 minutes questions from the interviewer</p></li><li><p>5-7 minutes questions from the candidate</p></li></ul><p><strong>Most first-round interviews stick to behavioral questions</strong><span>, i.e. questions that ask you about your own experiences, like</span><em> “Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a colleague.”</em></p><p><strong>Generally, the first-round interview scope isn’t comprehensive.</strong><span> Employers aren’t going to be able to fully assess your fit for the role/team/company in less than 60 minutes! </span></p><p><em>Note: It’s a bit of a hot take, but I advise people to run if a company gives you an offer at this stage. (Just imagine how undiscerning they will have been with your future peers as well!) </em></p><p>On-the-spot offers in tech are rare, but all of us who build products know that systems fail at the edge cases—few of you will get an offer in your first or second interview (and this is a good thing), but my advice is to walk away (or at least ask a lot of questions) if you get an offer on the spot.</p><p><strong>Common first-round interview question themes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Your resume and online content (including expertise posts and thought leadership)</p></li><li><p>1-2 core competencies for the role (usually the P0s, not the P2s and P3s)</p></li><li><p><span>Culture fit (these can be direct questions, e.g. “</span><em>Describe your ideal team culture,” </em><span>or indirect assessments based on your behavior, mannerisms, or speech: what you say and how you say it)</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>Special cases</strong></p><p><em>Are you a software engineer or data scientist? </em><span>Your first-round interview will likely be a technical screen (coding or system design or experimental design). Note that the way you problem-solve and communicate are assessed, not just whether you arrive at a working solution!</span></p><p><em>Are you a PM?</em><span> Your first-round interview will likely focus more on product design, product sense/execution, and data analysis or estimation questions (PM core competencies).</span></p><p>It’s time to talk about tactics for interview preparation. </p><p>Now is a good time to introduce Minimum Viable Interview Prep (MVIP). Below is a quick summary of the approach, with links to dive deeper before your next interview.</p><p><strong>Know your digital footprint</strong></p><p>Anything and everything on the open web is fair game for an employer or interviewer to read and bring up in your interviews. This includes LinkedIn posts, Medium or Substack articles, GitHub, tweets, old blog posts, quotes in newspaper articles, etc. </p><p>A useful to-do list:</p><ol><li><p>Know what’s out there (about you or authored by you)</p></li><li><p>Assess whether it fits how you’d like to present yourself</p></li><li><p>Modify as needed to represent yourself as you’d prefer</p></li></ol><p>For example: If I were looking for a data science role, I’d want to spend a few hours organizing the Python code in my public machine learning GitHub repo. It was written under timeline duress (!) and needs some refactoring so I can put my best foot forward if someone skims the code.</p><p><strong>Know your (strategic and compelling) reasons for wanting this role</strong></p><p>When you go for an interview, you should assume the company is assessing at least two to four other people for the role. Like any competition, you want to get out front quickly and take the lead. One way to do this is to be clear and concise about why you want this job.</p><p>Generally, avoid reasons that revolve around work hygiene or professional conveniences, e.g. compensation, short commute, remote work. This advice may seem obvious, but yes, people bring these up often. Don’t be one of them.</p><p>Avoid reasons that sound like complaints about your current or past employer, e.g. “better company,” “smarter colleagues,” “kinder boss,” “escaping a toxic culture.”</p><p>Stick to reasons that: </p><ol><li><p>convey what you bring to the role (the compelling ones for the employer)</p></li><li><p>explain how this role will accelerate your career (the strategic reasons)</p></li></ol><p><span>You don’t need 10 reasons. One single, decisive reason will do: </span><em>“I’ve spent eight years building large-scale, distributed systems for products used by about 100 million users. An exciting and progressive step for me would be to build similar technologies for the billion-user scale.”</em></p><p><strong>Know the role (map it)</strong></p><p>One of the oldest sales tricks in the book is a tactic called “mirroring.” It’s a psychological concept that involves physically and verbally doing what the other person is doing. People are comfortable with their own mannerisms. When you mirror them, you make them comfortable and subconsciously make them feel you are like them.</p><p><span>You can use mirroring in your interview process. How? Use </span><em>their</em><span> language when describing </span><em>your</em><span> experiences.</span></p><p><strong>How to do this (interview pre-work)</strong></p><ol><li><p>Paste the job description into a doc, then highlight keywords and concepts.</p></li><li><p><span>Put the keywords into a table (one row per keyword or concept). Then add a column to the right. </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16rMkstp5LsN99TEGALCBE4_bM7KqxpOW35swrIRzyD8/copy" rel="">Here’s a template to get you started</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p>In the right column, write down parts of your experience that map to that concept.</p></li><li><p>Read this before your interview.</p></li><li><p>In the interview, when you talk about your experience (right column), use their language (left column) to explain what you did.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Yet there’s more to it…</p><p>Behavioral interview questions were invented 50 years ago, in the 1970s. Studies quickly found that these questions were 55% more effective at predicting on-the-job performance than the prevailing interview questions at the time. They took the business world by storm and became the de facto interview technique. Today, they are used extensively in tech interviews (by my estimate, more than 60% of interview questions are behavioral). Amazon actually sends candidates a STAR primer before their interviews!</p><p><span>But it’s been half a century, and behavioral question formats </span><em>have</em><strong> </strong><span>evolved. Your approach to answering them needs to evolve too.</span></p><p>In tech, I see 3 main formats for behavioral questions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Pure </strong><span>— “Tell me about a time when…” </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Situational </strong><span>— “Put yourself in this situation; what would you do?”</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Theoretical </strong><span>— “What’s your general approach to doing X?”</span></p></li></ol><p><span>All of them ask what you </span><strong>have done</strong><span> or what you </span><strong>would do </strong><span>(in a situation) or what you </span><strong>generally do</strong><span>, to extrapolate and predict on-the-job performance. To interview effectively in tech today, you need to know how to answer each of these questions. </span></p><p>Below is a primer you can use to answer each type of behavioral interview question.</p><p><strong>Why they ask: </strong><span>Understanding how you’ve behaved in the past can be used to extrapolate how you might perform in this role</span></p><p><strong>What they ask: </strong><span>Share a specific career experience from the past</span></p><p><strong>How to respond:</strong><span> Start with</span><strong> </strong><span>STAR, then add two improvements.

In this case, it was having personal chats with colleagues during core work hours.</em></p><p><em>Next, I needed to plan the messaging, to avoid making the person feel attacked or defensive. I decided to express the problem in terms of how it impacted both their project success and their teammate’s stress levels. Then, I planned some alignment questions to ensure we were in agreement on the problem, the change that needed to happen, and how we were going to hold ourselves accountable to measure success and check in.</em></p><p><em>Then, I had the conversation with the team member.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Results:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The team member immediately acknowledged the issue, since they knew themselves to be chatty, and thanked me for bringing the impacts (to others) to their attention. We aligned quickly on a plan to check in monthly, and the team member agreed to let me periodically probe the team to ensure that the change was taking place.</em></p><p><em>Within two months, the issue was resolved.

Half of the battle is preparing well and showing up to answer </span><em>the interviewer’s</em><strong> </strong><span>questions; the other half is asking </span><em>them</em><strong> </strong><span>questions that get them thinking (and make you stand out).</span></p><p>We all want to work with exceptional colleagues who work hard, get things done, and push us to greater heights. Interviewers are exactly the same. You need to get them thinking (in a good way).</p><p>Formulate questions that are interesting and thoughtful, and you’ll end the interview on a high note and possibly put yourself in the lead.</p><p>3 steps to formulating great questions for interviewers:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Define the signals you need (to determine if you want the role). </strong><span>Bring questions whose answers are actually important to you. Anyone can grab a question from a listicle. Only you can ask questions that will answer your open questions about the role.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Do your research. </strong><span>On the industry, company, competitive landscape, team/product, and even the interviewers. Look for trends, competitive landscape changes, and news. You can find these on consulting firm dossiers, VC thought-leadership white papers, the company’s website, Yahoo Finance, and competitive landscape engines like G2 and Capterra.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Formulate questions</strong><span> that highlight that you’ve done your homework and that give you the signal you want.</span></p></li></ol><p>You can do this in an hour or two, and it’s well worth the investment. You can even reuse some of these “first-round” questions in later interviews to get diverse perspectives from the full panel.</p><p>An example of a high-signal question that one of my coaching clients
