<h2 id="what-is-the-colmi-r02">What is the Colmi R02?</h2>

<p><img src="https://cdn.tahnok.ca/u/banner_colmi_r02.png" alt="picture of the colmi r02 smart ring in shiny black. The electronics can be seen through the epoxy inside the ring" width="100%"/></p>

<p>It&#39;s a cheap (as in $20) &#34;smart ring&#34; / fitness wearable that includes the following sensors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accelerometer
<ul>
<li>step tracking</li>
<li>sleep tracking</li>
<li>gestures (maybe...?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Heart Rate (HR)</li>
<li>Blood Oxygen (SPO2)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found out about the ring from atc1441 and his work on <a href="https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_RF03_Ring/">ATC_RF03</a> and the 
<a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/06/16/new-part-day-a-hackable-smart-ring/">Hackaday coverage</a></p>

<p>You can get it on <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006631448993.html">here on AliExpress</a>. If that link is dead try searching for &#34;COLMI R02&#34;, I got mine from &#34;Colmi official store&#34;. It cost me $CAD 22 shipped.</p>

<h2 id="reverse-engineering-status">Reverse engineering status</h2>

<li> Set HR log frequency</li>
<li> SPO2 logs</li>
<li> Sleep tracking</li>
<li> &#34;Stress&#34; measurement</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="planned-feature">Planned Feature</h2>

<ul>
<li>add more CLI functionlity</li>

<h3 id="using-the-command-line">Using the command line</h3>

<p>If you don&#39;t know python that well, I <strong>highly</strong> recommend you install <a href="https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/">pipx</a>. It&#39;s puprpose built for managing python packages intended to be used as standalone programs and it will keep your computer safe from the pitfalls of python packaging. Once installed you can do</p>

<div>
<pre><span></span><code>pipx<span> </span>install<span> </span>git+https://github.com/tahnok/colmi_r02_client
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once that is done you can look for nearby rings using</p>



<pre><code>Found device(s)
                Name  | Address
--------------------------------------------
            R02_341C  |  70:CB:0D:D0:34:1C
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have your address you can use it to do things like get real time heart rate</p>

<div>
<pre><span></span><code>colmi_r02_client<span> </span>--address<span>=</span><span>70</span>:CB:0D:D0:34:1C<span> </span>get-real-time-heart-rate
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="with-the-library-sdk">With the library / sdk</h3>

<p>You can use the <code><a href="https://elijer.github.io/garden/devnotes/LeetCode-Journal/colmi_r02_client/client.html">colmi_r02_client.client</a></code> class as a library to do your own stuff in python. I&#39;ve tried to write a lot of docstrings, which are visible on <a href="https://tahnok.github.io/colmi_r02_client/">the docs site</a></p>

<h2 id="communication-protocol-details">Communication Protocol Details</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve kept a lab notebook style stream of consciousness notes on <a href="https://notes.tahnok.ca/">https://notes.tahnok.ca/</a>, starting with <a href="https://notes.tahnok.ca/blog/2024-07-07+Smart+Ring+Hacking">2024-07-07 Smart Ring Hacking</a> and eventually getting put under one folder. That&#39;s the best source for all the raw stuff.</p>

<p>At a high level though, you can talk to and read from the ring using BLE. There&#39;s no binding or security keys required to get started. (that&#39;s kind of bad, but the range on the ring is really tiny and I&#39;m not too worried about someone getting my steps or heart rate information. Up to you).</p>

<p>The ring has a ble GATT service with the UUID <code>6E40FFF0-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E</code>. It has two important characteristics:</p>

<ol>
<li>RX: <code>6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E</code>, which you write to</li>
<li>TX: <code>6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E</code>, which you can &#34;subscribe&#34; to and is where the ring responds to packets you have sent.</li>
</ol>

<p>This closely ressembles the <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/libraries/bluetooth_services/services/nus.html">Nordic UART Service</a> and UART/Serial communications in general.</p>

<h3 id="packet-structure">Packet structure</h3>

<p>The ring communicates in 16 byte packets for both sending and receiving. The first byte of the packet is always a command/tag/type. For example, the packet you send to ask for the battery level starts with <code>0x03</code> and the response packet also starts with <code>0x03</code>.</p>

<p>The last byte of the packet is always a checksum/crc. This value is calculated by summing up the other 15 bytes in the packet and taking the result modulo 255. See <code><a href="https://elijer.github.io/garden/devnotes/LeetCode-Journal/colmi_r02_client/packet.html#checksum">colmi_r02_client.packet.checksum</a></code></p>

<p>The middle 14 bytes are the &#34;subdata&#34; or payload data. Some requests (like <code><a href="https://elijer.github.io/garden/devnotes/LeetCode-Journal/colmi_r02_client/set_time.html#set_time_packet">colmi_r02_client.set_time.set_time_packet</a></code>) include additional data. Almost all responses use the subdata to return the data you asked for.</p>

<p>Some requests result in multiple responses that you have to consider together to get the data. <code><a href="https://elijer.github.io/garden/devnotes/LeetCode-Journal/colmi_r02_client/steps.html#SportDetailParser">colmi_r02_client.steps.SportDetailParser</a></code> is an example of this behaviour.</p>

<p>If you want to know the actual packet structure for a given feature&#39;s request or response, take a look at the source code for that feature. I&#39;ve tried to make it pretty easy to follow even if you don&#39;t know python very well. There are also some tests that you can refer to for validated request/response pairs and human readable interpretations of that data.</p>
