    <h1>Ask HN: How to get an accessibility tester job as a blind programmer?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I want to test accessibility for apps and websites as a job. I regularly use pretty much all screen readers except Orca, I use VoiceOver for anything Apple makes, JAWS or NVDA anything Windows, and Talkback in Android. I haven’t had a formal education on accessibility, but I use these screen readers to navigate websites and apps daily, so my skills is pretty good. I also like coding in Java, I love that language, I consider Java the best language since C. I only code in Java, because I can’t C (a little joke). So, if you have an app that you want their accessibility tested, let me know I will do that for you: I currently only own iPhone, though.</p><p>So, HN, who wants their accessibility tested for their website or apps for blind people or low-vision people?</p></div></div></div>
