        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Imitation learning from human demonstrations has shown impressive performance in robotics. However, most results focus on table-top manipulation, lacking the mobility and dexterity necessary for generally useful tasks.
            In this work, we develop a system for imitating mobile manipulation tasks that are bimanual and require whole-body control.
            We first present Mobile ALOHA, a low-cost and whole-body teleoperation system for data collection. It augments the ALOHA system with a mobile base, and a whole-body teleoperation interface.
            Using data collected with Mobile ALOHA, we then perform supervised behavior cloning and find that co-training with existing static ALOHA datasets boosts performance on mobile manipulation tasks.
            With 50 demonstrations for each task, co-training can increase success rates by up to 90%, allowing Mobile ALOHA to autonomously complete complex mobile manipulation tasks such as sauteing and serving a piece of shrimp,
            opening a two-door wall cabinet to store heavy cooking pots, calling and entering an elevator,
            and lightly rinsing a used pan using a kitchen faucet.
