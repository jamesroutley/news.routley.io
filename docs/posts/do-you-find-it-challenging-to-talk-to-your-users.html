    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>One of the problems I faced when I had my first users on [just-diary.com](<a href="http://just-diary.com" rel="nofollow">http://just-diary.com</a>) is that I didnâ€™t have any way to talk to them. Like getting feedback on using the product, asking them questions about what they want from it, and sharing some tips on how to use some features.<p>Does anyone have the same problem? If yes, how did you solve it?</p></td></div></div>
