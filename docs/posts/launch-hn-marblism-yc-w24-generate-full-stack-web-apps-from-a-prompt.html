    <h1>Launch HN: Marblism (YC W24) – Generate full-stack web apps from a prompt</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi HN,</p><p>We are Cyril &amp; Ulric and are building Marblism (<a href="https://marblism.com">https://marblism.com</a>), an LLM-based dev platform to generate and iterate on full-stack web apps.</p><p>Here’s a demo video that goes from a comment on Twitter to a working app in 10 minutes: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TapOPO-Gv20" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TapOPO-Gv20</a>.</p><p>Marblism started when we realized that much of the code we write for web apps is just slightly modified boilerplate: similar login flows, dashboards, API integrations, CRUD operations, etc. While AI tools are helpful, they fall short in delivering a well-architected codebase. The idea of Marblism is to combine the best of both worlds: a solid boilerplate, customized and enhanced with AI.</p><p>Here&#39;s how it works:</p><p><i>Generate your app</i> -  Describe your product, and the AI will build your data model. We create a NextJS app with auth, custom CRUDs, permissions, payment, emails. The AI then generates your front-end pages.</p><p><i>Test and improve your app</i> - Now that your app is set up, use our online workspace to test your app and add more complex features via an AI Chat or directly yourself in the VSCode editor.</p><p><i>Go live</i> - Once you’re happy with your app, deploy it in production in one click.</p><p>Here are some examples of apps generated on Marblism in couple of hours of prompting:</p><p>Find and validate startup ideas: <a href="https://www.muckbrass.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.muckbrass.com/</a></p><p>A design system directory: <a href="https://awesomedesignsystem.app.io" rel="nofollow">https://awesomedesignsystem.app.io</a></p><p>AI-Personalized candle: <a href="https://www.scent-a-scene.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.scent-a-scene.com/</a></p><p>Marblism currently generates web apps like SaaS, marketplaces, and social networks. It doesn&#39;t support Chrome extensions or mobile apps, and it’s not really for small games like Snake/Tetris.</p><p>The vision is to add more tech stacks later this year and enable people to create their own templates/tech stack that the AI can customize.</p><p>We’re really excited to share this with you and we&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on the potential directions we can take this product.</p></div></div></div>
