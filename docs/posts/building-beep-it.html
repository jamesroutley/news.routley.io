    <h1>building beep it</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of my goals when I came to <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> was to
‚Äúget better at hardware,‚Äù which was admittedly somewhat of a vague goal. Without
an obvious problem that I needed to solve with hardware, it was hard to decide
<em>what</em> to build. After soaking up some of the playful energy here at RC, a brief
exploration with a simple Simon Says game, I landed on Beep It!, a clunky remake
of the classic 90s Bop It! game.</p>

<p><img src="https://katestud.dev/assets/beep-to-start.jpg" alt="beep to start"/></p>

<p>This seemed like a good way to expand my hardware skills in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I wanted to design a container for the box so that the game could be safely
protected from playing hands (and ‚Äúeasily‚Äù transported).</li>
  <li>I wanted to be able to move past the breadboard prototyping phase. Because
interactions with Beep It! can get a bit rough (üòÖ), I had to figure out how to
solder the pieces together in a more durable and permanent manner.</li>
  <li>I wanted the game to be portable, and thus, battery powered.</li>
  <li>I wanted to get more familiar with more types of sensors and protocols, of which
Beep It has many!</li>
</ul>

<p>Here‚Äôs a quick write up of the implementation and what I learned.</p>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<p>The gameplay for Beep It! requires the user to perform the requested action by
the game, which required a number of sensors. I decided to build the following
interactions for the game:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Raspberry Pi Pico:</strong> The Pico is a really good option for the game because
it‚Äôs very low power so it can easily be powered by a battery. It also has three
analog pins so I didn‚Äôt need to deal with an analog-to-digital converter. The I2C
pins were also pretty easy to work with.</li>
  <li><strong>Beep It!</strong> This is powered by a TTP223B1 Touch Sensor. This sensor worked
really well as it registers touch on both sides of the sensor, and can also register
touch through other materials. I decided to protect the sensor with small sticker
and found a cute little bee sticker, so that‚Äôs how the Beep It! name was born.</li>
  <li><strong>Shake It!</strong> The shake action is powered by an MPU6050 6-degree-of-freedom
sensor. I think shaking is the scariest part of the game because all the hardware
just kinda clunks around in the box. But, I don‚Äôt think it would be as fun without it.</li>
  <li><strong>Slide It!</strong> This is powered by a slide potentiometer! This is connected to
one of the analog pins.</li>
  <li><strong>Flick It!</strong> powered by a KY023 Joystick. This sensor connects to the other
two analog pins (for the x and y movement). The joystick can also register a click
event but that wasn‚Äôt relevant for Beep It!, so I left that pin alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a couple types of output / feedback for the player of the game:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>16x2 LCD Display:</strong> The display is the primary mode of instruction. This
device prints out instructions (such as which move to make), feedback on whether
the player took the correct move, and a final score.</li>
  <li><strong>Piezo Buzzer:</strong> The buzzer adds another layer of excitement to the game. It
plays a short song on game start up, has a custom sound for each movement, and
buzzes if the player gets the move wrong. The piezo ended up being a really good
simple solution for folding audio into the game. My original plan was to figure
out how to hook up a speaker that would play <code>.wav</code> files but the wiring and
components required were adding a layer of complexity I wasn‚Äôt ready to deal with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soe of the sensors were available in a <a href="https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/kepler-kit/en/latest/">Sunfounder Hardware Kit</a>
I had purchased, which also has a very nice set of tutorials. The other sensors
I didn‚Äôt have access to were easily purchased on Amazon!</p>

<h2 id="designing-the-circuits">Designing the circuits</h2>

<p>Because the game has so many sensors, I wanted to be very intentional about what
pins I was using. I also wanted to document the schematic so it would be easier
to translate it from the breadboard prototype to a more ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù wired game.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://fritzing.org/">Fritzing</a>! I found this software to be super helpful
for designing and translating the schematic. I was able to find fritzing files
for most of the sensors I had purchased, with the exception of the slide potentiometer.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the schematic I ended up with:</p>

<p><img src="https://katestud.dev/assets/beep-it-fritzing.png" alt="beep it fritzing"/></p>

<h2 id="wiring-the-circuits">Wiring the circuits</h2>

<p>The final translated wiring looks a bit different, as the wiring for the power
and ground was getting a bit unwieldy, so some of the power and ground wires
connect directly to the Pico, while some others are connected in a sort of ‚Äúpower
bank‚Äù type of solder mess. :)</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what (almost) everything looked like when it was wired via the breadboard. It was
quite hard to test with everything hooked up this way!</p>

<p><img src="https://katestud.dev/assets/beep-it-breadboard.jpg" alt="breadboard"/></p>

<p>And here‚Äôs what everything looked like once the wiring had been translated to
a PCB board.</p>

<p><img src="https://katestud.dev/assets/beep-it-wired.jpg" alt="pcb"/></p>

<p>It was quite the mess of wires and solder. This was my first time soldering
‚Äúfor real‚Äù and I found it quite tricky. Getting the solder to flow ‚Äújust right‚Äù
was very difficult and the end result is very messy. I did have to debug the
circuits a bit as some of the connections were a bit shoddy on my first attempt.
I think it also probably took me 5 times longer to complete all the soldering
than it would have for someone more experienced.</p>

<p>What I do like about the ‚Äúfinished‚Äù result is that only the battery and the piezo
are hard wired to the device. All other sensors can be easily disconnected so
I can get them nestled in the box before connecting the board to them.</p>

<h2 id="building-the-game-logic">Building the game logic</h2>

<p>The software for the game felt like the most straightforward part of this project.</p>

<p>Writing software for the Pico ended up being much more delightful than I expected!
A few tools that helped me get this part up and running quickly were:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go">MicroPico VS Code Extension</a>
which allows for super easy connection to the hardware device via serial. This
opens a REPL on the device and allows for super easy debugging of the code. I am
really glad I found this; the tutorial I had been following was using Thonny
which was not sparking joy for me. It was nice to be able to use the tools I was
already comfortable with!</li>
  <li>MicroPython in general was so easy to work with! The one tricky thing I ran into
here was figuring out how to import libraries that are specific to the Pico. I
ended up just copy-pasting some of the necessary libraries (such as <a href="https://github.com/Fattelodasolo/MicroPython/blob/d125cdb124c8ce78970c8cfc9c1deaf804068efc/LCD%20I2C/i2c_lcd.py">i2c lcd</a>) into my project
for use which is apparently a legit thing to do.</li>
</ul>

<p>The game logic itself is relatively straightforward. The biggest problem in the
logic was having to correctly handle debounces and fine tuning the sensitivity
for each sensor. One way I solved for debounces
was by adding more of a delay in between the instructions. At first this felt like
cheating, but the delay I currently have in place seems to feel pretty good
during game play so I‚Äôll probably not mess with it too much.</p>

<p>To deal with the sensor sensitivity, I did a lot of debugging by connecting the
device via the USB port and printing out sensor readings. This helped me figure
out what the right thresholds were for each sensor. One of the more interesting
findings was that the joystick seemed to work well until I attached everything
to the box. It seems that I got some glue on the joystick and it started reading
somewhat inconsistent values in the default position. This was easy enough to
address by only responding to very high or very low values.</p>

<h2 id="designing-the-game-box">Designing the game box</h2>

<p>Beep It! isn‚Äôt Beep It! without a box. I wanted to design a box that would give
the player easy (enough) access to the sensors without having to move their hands
too much, would protect the game, and wouldn‚Äôt be too big or unwieldy.</p>

<p>Luckily, Recurse Center has a 3d printer that I had done one test print on before,
so I decided it was time to figure out how to design my own 3d printed element.</p>

<p>After taking a look at AutoCAD, FreeCAD, and Blender, I felt totally overwhelmed.
It felt like it‚Äôd be a really big time investment to learn how to use any of those
tools and I wasn‚Äôt sure it would work. Then I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad</a> which was
the perfect fit for me. It had great tutorials and makes building simple shapes
very easy. Shapes and holes are very easy to create and position, and to specify
exact measurements.</p>

<p>I attempted a couple different designs before settling on the final box design.
This design has all sensors on the front / top of the box so the player could
place the box on a table or desk to play if they felt it was a bit too big to handle.</p>

<p>The box has holes to expose each of the sensors, a sliding bottom cover, and a
slot for the battery and debugging cable.</p>

<p><img src="https://katestud.dev/assets/beep-it-3d.gif" alt="3d"/></p>

<p>Printing the box on the printer took quite some time, as the printer at RC has
been a bit finicky and the print requires some babysitting. But after a few hours,
the box was finally done!</p>

<p><img src="https://katestud.dev/assets/beep-it-box.jpg" alt="box"/></p>

<h2 id="assembling-it-all-together">Assembling it all together</h2>

<p>Once the code was (mostly) working and all the pieces built, it was time to
assemble it. Unfortunately, some of the sensors weren‚Äôt designed in a way that
they could be (easily) mounted, so I had to get a bit creative.</p>

<p>The touch sensor and the joystick were somewhat easily glued to the box, while
the LCD display and the slider had to be (strategically) taped to the inside
of the box. This isn‚Äôt particularly durable and the slider has had to be re-taped
a few times. I‚Äôd like to come up with something more permanent here but I might
have to look for a different sensor.</p>

<p>Since the sensors are detachable from the main PCB board via header pins and
pluggable cables, it‚Äôs easy to pull the PCB board out if, for example, some of the
soldering needs to be fixed. üòâ</p>

<p>Once the sensors are mounted into the device, it‚Äôs simple enough to connect everything,
velcro the battery pack to the outside of the box, and slide the lid shut.</p>

<p>And voil√†, we have a working game!</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>While this wasn‚Äôt necessarily a capstone project for my time at RC, it was
definitely my most involved project, which required a decent time investment
and lots of learning at the edge of my abilities. I have to say, I‚Äôm pretty impressed
with how the end result turned out. When I first decided ‚Äúsure, I‚Äôll build bop it,‚Äù
I had no idea how I‚Äôd even go about it. But, just like a software project, breaking
the problem down into iterative steps helped me stay focused and take it
one day at a time.</p>

<p>Of course, <em>unlike</em> software projects, a bit more advance planning was necessary.
I wasn‚Äôt quite sure how to approach building the sound and kind of just made some
guesses about what would work. In retrospect, I think I should have done a bit
more research about which exact sensors I needed and made sure that the Pico would
be able to handle all of them. I would have also spent a bit more time confirming
measurements of the designed box before attempting the first 3d print.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm excited to take these learnings with me to my next hardware project, whatever
that may be!</p>
