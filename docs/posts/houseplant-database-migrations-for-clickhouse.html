<hr/>
<p>At June, we use ClickHouse as our analytics database to process billions of user events and generate real-time insights for our customers. While ClickHouse is incredibly powerful for analytical workloads, managing database schema changes has been a pain in our dev workflow.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional relational databases that have mature migration tools (like ActiveRecord for Rails), ClickHouse lacks a robust solution for managing schema migrations. We&#39;d accumulated a lot of migrations and rake tasks to manage the schema of our ClickHouse cluster, but over time, it became hard for one person to make sense of all of it, let alone four.</p>
<p>We love working with ActiveRecord and how easy it makes checking the database schema, generating, applying, and rolling back migrations (if needed!). We wanted something similar for ClickHouse, so we built it ourselves.</p>
<p>Today, we&#39;re excited to announce <strong>Houseplant</strong>, a Python-based CLI tool that brings ActiveRecord-style migrations to ClickHouse!</p>
