    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>John Carmack&#39;s new interview on AI/AGI [1] carries a puzzle:</p><p>“So I asked Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s chief scientist, for a reading list. He gave me a list of like 40 research papers and said, ‘If you really learn all of these, you’ll know 90% of what matters today.’ And I did. I plowed through all those things and it all started sorting out in my head.”</p><p>What papers do you think were on this list?</p><p>[1] https://dallasinnovates.com/exclusive-qa-john-carmacks-different-path-to-artificial-general-intelligence/</p></div></div></div>
