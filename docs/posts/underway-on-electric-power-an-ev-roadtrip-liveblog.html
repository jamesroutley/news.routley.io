<h3>Underway on Electric Power, an EV Roadtrip liveblog</h3>

<p>
I&#39;m going on an electric car road trip - Seattle to Bodega Bay, CA to help my ex- in the field at Bodega Marine Reserve; then Bodega Bay, CA to Dolores, CO to train for and ride the <a href="https://www.ironhorsebicycleclassic.com/">Iron Horse Bicycle Classic</a> and to go to the Telluride Bluegrass Festival with family; then back to Seattle.
</p>

<p>
I&#39;m driving a Chevy Bolt; the Bolt uses the &#34;CCS&#34; network of public chargers, like most non-Tesla electric cars. CCS and public charging have a mixed-reputation; electric roadtripping is still a &#34;new&#34; phenomena, especially with non-Teslas. My co-worker <a href="https://medium.com/@elizzy2001">Liz Shelly</a> prompted me to share my experiences - how I plan the trip, how / where I charge and camp, and what worked and what didn&#39;t!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be liveblogging the trip; day 1, Tacoma, WA on to Oregon!
