    <h1>How we boosted our marketing email open rate</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
    <p>At <a href="https://browserling.com">Browserling</a> and <a href="https://onlinetools.com">Online Tools</a>, one simple trick changed our marketing email open rate from 20% to 60%.</p>
<p>This trick was to start sending the emails at the same hour the user last visited our website.</p>
<p>For example, if a user was last on our website at 3:43pm, then now we send the marketing emails to this user at around 3pm.</p>
<p>Before this trick, we were sending the emails at random times.</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>
