    <h1>The Ribbon Microphone</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

last september (as of jan ‘25), in a fit of pique, i sliced my modmic off
its cable, then designed and built a ribbon microphone as a replacement.

aside from some background hum, unavoidable since the ribbon-to-return-wire
loop has nonzero area and i can&#39;t magnetically shield it myself, this device
sounds (subjectively) like a studio mic.<span><small>
	this was <i>not</i> rigorously tested in the least! i&#39;m no expert on
	frequency response verification of microphones (and don&#39;t have an
	anechoic chamber to do it in, anyway). if you have reliable (and
	cheap?) techniques for mic analysis, let me know!
</small></span><span><small>
	oh, also: this page was written well after the fact, and so contains
	fewer sources than i&#39;d like.

<h2 id="how-it-works">how a ribbon works</h2>

a ribbon mic motor (the term for the bit that picks up sound) consists of a
gossamer-thin strip of corrugated aluminum slung loosely between two powerful
magnets (or, equivalently, ferrous pole pieces). when sound reaches the motor,
the ribbon bends along the corrugations — which moves it across the
magnetic field it&#39;s sitting in, generating a small potential across the ribbon
which runs off to the preamp.

<figure>

		this website. great..." alt="an illustration of a ribbon motor"/>

</figure>

electrically, physically, relatively simple. but there are three main problems
you run into (well, i ran into) when trying to actually build one:
<ol>
	<li>
		the signal out of the ribbon is tiny: i wound up with a
		relatively high-output ribbon, which provides about 200 μVpp
		when i speak assertively into it. this is easily swamped by
		electrical noise, if you happen to live in an electrically
		noisy apartment.<span><small>
			<sc>ham</sc>s will look at me like i&#39;m a wuss... which,
			basically, i am: microvolts can absolutely be amplified
			without a lot of noise. <i>however,</i> for a ribbon
			mic, you have to do so across three decades of
			bandwidth and can&#39;t selectively filter out line hum
			because it&#39;s within your target band. <a href="https://artofelectronics.net/">horowitz
			<i>&amp;</i> hill</a> have a good treatise on how to
			build an amp that can pull this off, provided you have
			sufficient shielding (which i don&#39;t).
		</small></span>
	</li>

	<li>
		the ribbon itself is <i>exceedingly</i> delicate: modern ribbon
		mics use 2.5 μm or 6 μm aluminum for the ribbon, which
		breaks very easily. those foil gauges are not particularly
		available, either, so i had to make do with something even
		worse. more on that later.
	</li>

	<li>
		the ribbon has very low resistance (around 500 mΩ for
		mine). this may seem like a good thing, but it means that the
		<i>slightest</i> stray resistance in the ribbon mounting setup
		will appreciably decrease your output if you have a reasonably
		well-matched preamp. this is probably the least problematic of
		the three, though.
	</li>
</ol>
all that to say: i did not realize quite what i had gotten myself into when i
cut my mic cable. ah well.

<h2 id="mechanical">mechanical</h2>

i think this is a sensible place to start. many of the design decisions for
this mic were a direct consequence of the mechanical constraints of the
microphone, including what parts i could actually find.

<h3 id="ribbon-material">ribbon material</h3>

i decided to use imitation silver leaf (also known as signwriter&#39;s leaf, at
least to some audiophiles on the internet). it&#39;s made of nearly pure aluminum
beaten around 0.5 μm thick, approxmately the same thickness as the ribbon
used in <i>very</i> early commercial ribbons. (and perhaps some modern ribbons,
though i would be surprised.)

<p>
i would have used 2.5 μm 1000-grade aluminum foil, but the only quantities
easily available on the internet are small, expensive, 6-by-12 cm rectangles
sold specifically for reribboning microphones. since i had an interest in
keeping this microphone cheap and repeatable, i wanted something a little more
reliable as a source. so, naturally, i turned to alibaba. after speaking to
around eight suppliers, i found that either:
</p><ol>
	<li>
		they had 2.5 μm foil in 8011 only, which i didn&#39;t want due
		to the increased resistivity of the alloy,
	</li>

	<li>
		they <i>said</i> they had 2.5 μm foil in stock, but actually
		didn&#39;t when pressed (the majority of responses), or
	</li>

	<li>
		they could custom-make 1000-grade 2.5 μm foil, but had a
		<sc>moq</sc> of 10 metric tons... which, according to a quick
		back-of-the-envelope a <span>friend</span>
		prodded me to do, is probably more foil than has been used in
		all ribbon microphones since the beginning of time.
	</li>
</ol>
so i had to find another source. one diyaudio thread mentioned that
signwriter&#39;s leaf had worked, though it had been finicky, so... i decided to
try that.

<i>turns out,</i> this material is a royal pain in the ass to work with.

<h3 id="corrugation">ribbon corrugation</h3>

the ribbon in the mic has to be lightly corrugated to help it both hold the
correct tension and move when under that tension. this, naturally, requires you
to corrugate the ribbon.<span><small>
	for some reason, i feel the need to point out that this was an attempt
	at humor.
</small></span>

<p>
the basic procedure (at least for avid hobbyists) is (a) print some
fine-pitched gears, then (b) run a cut ribbon between those gears. this works
great with 6 μm foil, pretty well with 2.5 μm foil, and destroys 0.5
μm foil instantly — signwriter&#39;s leaf is fragile enough to break if
you&#39;re brutish enough to touch it with a finger or blow too hard at it, much
less callously mash it between coarse 3<sc>d</sc>-printed parts. since i could
not touch the ribbon material, i came up with a corrugation method that does
not require it. without further ado:
</p><ol>
	<li>
		superglue two sheets of printer paper together. these will form
		the sacrificial shield inside of which the leaf will live.
	</li>

	<li>
		carefully place a single sheet of leaf between the sheets of
		paper. you will have to directly handle the leaf for this...
		but fortunately do not have to do anything precise to it, so
		use cotton gloves of the sort often found alongside this leaf.
		place it approxmately square with the edges of the paper
		shield.
	</li>

	<li>
		slice the shield with a rotary paper cutter at a known width
		such that the slice cuts through the leaf. this will give an
		easy reference for getting leaf strips of the right width.
	</li>

		helping hands a girl could ask for.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

	<li>
		shift the leaf/shield combo 5 mm (if you&#39;re me) and slice
		again. this will give you a strip of leaf sandwiched between
		two strips of paper.
	</li>

	<li>
		cut two strips of paper long enough to completely enclose the
		leaf, and as wide as the gears you&#39;re using. soak both in
		isopropyl alcohol and lay it perfectly flat on a table.
	</li>

	<li>
		remove one of the shield strips from around the leaf, press the
		leaf into the soaked strip, and carefully remove the remaining
		shield strip from the back of the leaf. press the other soaked
		strip onto the first strip. they should stick together just
		enough to allow you to pick up the sandwich, leaf inside.
	</li>

	<figcaption>

		shield strips to another.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

	<li>
		run the entire sandwich through the gears to corrugate it.
		don&#39;t be afraid to press hard: “<span>the
		ribbon can sense fear</span>,” and it takes some force to
		get the stack to fold enough, especially with fine-pitch gears.
	</li>

<figure>
	<img src="https://khz.ac/sound/ribbon-mic/images/sandwich-gears.jpg" title="my hands aren&#39;t ready for the internet yet, so they&#39;re
		not actually applying the requisite force here." alt="a ribbon sandwich getting crunched"/>
	<figcaption>
		the gear position is slightly misleading, as the sandwich
		should look <i>smushed</i> when rolling over it.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

	<li>
		wait for the sandwich to dry. gross.
	</li>

	<li>
		once dry, carefully<span><small>
			i write that a lot, don&#39;t i? it&#39;s a project that
			requires care in every aspect.
		</small></span>
		peel the top strip of paper away, then <i>very</i> carefully
		take a pair of flat-tipped tweezers and remove the now-ribbon
		from the other strip of paper. bending the second strip in a
		curve right where the ribbon cleaves from it can help cajole
		shy ribbons into separating without breaking.
	</li>
</ol>
for ribbon threading, i find it helpful to use the tweezers to superglue small
paper tabs to either end of the ribbon (usually just leftover from cutting it).
these allow ribbon manipulation without actually coming in contact with the
fragile metal itself.

		them." alt="a finished ribbon"/>
	<figcaption>

</figure>

<h3 id="magnets">magnets</h3>

use the strongest bar magnets you can find. they don&#39;t appreciably slow the
ribbon, and the more flux you can pack into the gap, the higher the output of
the microphone. i used two 5 by 10 by 60 mm <sc>n</sc>52 magnets spaced 6 mm
apart, which (in combination with my foil choice) gave me a relatively
high-output ribbon. and the higher the output, the easier the preamp will be,
and the less shielding you&#39;ll need...

<h3 id="ribbon-holding">holding the ribbon</h3>

the key is low impedance.<span><small>
	here i am doing the ee thing of using impedance when i really do mean
	resistance.
</small></span>
the ribbon itself has a resistance on the order of a hundred microohms, which
becomes on the order of a hundred ohms on the other side of a 1:31 step-up
transformer. <i>any</i> stray resistance in the mounting armature will reflect
to (potentially) hundreds of ohms, which tends to have a deleterious effect on
low-input-impedance preamps. this is not, however, a difficult problem to
solve, so i will simply provide a terrible photo and explain it.

<figure>
	<img src="https://khz.ac/sound/ribbon-mic/images/clamp-from-side.jpg" title="sorry about the angle. i didn&#39;t want to take the thing
		apart." alt="a close-up shot of a ribbon clamp"/>
	<figcaption>
		the ribbon clamp from the side. the soldered connection is
		behind.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

the clamp is formed in a C shape with a screw through the middle: when
tightening this screw, the clamping force is spread relatively evenly on either
end of the C. the ribbon end of the clamp has a small strip of copper tape
smoothed over it, with an identical smoothed strip on a raised bump opposite it
on the facing plate. these tape strips are what clamp the ribbon and form the
electrical connection to it.<span><small>
	most ribbon mics use two screws, one on either side of a flat bar clamp
	which holds the ribbon. this has the advantage that a delicate ribbon
	may simply be laid across the motor, rather than threaded, but the
	disadvantages of requiring two screws and some reasonable measure of
	stiffness from the bar. this could, of course, be alleviated with some
	clever design... but i&#39;m short on screws and long on patience, so i
	opted for a single-screw method.
</small></span>

<p>
this scheme allows for both single-screw adjustment of the clamping force and
minor adjustment to ribbon positioning via subtly rotating the C, which is
useful to get the 0.5 mm clearance even on either side of the ribbon. its only
downside is that, prior to clamping, the ribbon must be threaded through the
hole in the back plate (just visible in the photo) so as not to interfere with
the screw.

</p><h2 id="electrical">electrical</h2>

where the magic happens!

<p>
i don&#39;t have too much more to say other than i needed an active preamp because
my <sc>adc</sc> didn&#39;t take single-digit millivolts well, so let&#39;s dive in.

</p><h3 id="resistance">resistance measurement</h3>

how does one measure a 500 mΩ resistor accurately? using four wires!

<p>
one of my old lab instructors said “it&#39;s never the resistance in the
wires.” except, sometimes, it is. measuring resistances that are
substantially smaller than the contact resistance of the leads you&#39;re using is
inherently unreliable using only two leads — <i>even if you measure that
contact resistance once,</i> it will change as soon as you re-clip the thing
you&#39;re measuring!

</p><p>
this is why fancy desktop multimeters have an extra set of inputs. this allows
performing a four-wire resistance measurement, which renders contact resistance
insignificant; so long as the input current is much lower than the sense
current, there will be no appreciable voltage drop at the point of contact on
the sense line.
</p><figure>
	<img src="https://khz.ac/sound/ribbon-mic/images/four-wire.jpg" title="i will take any and every opportunity to mention this
		photo to someone." alt="an explanation of why four-wire measurement works"/>
	<figcaption>
		my humble justification of why four-wire measurement works.
		this is not that complicated but also not that common, so i&#39;ve
		brought it out here.
	</figcaption>
</figure>
theoretically, my ribbon should have a resistance of
<math display="block">
	<mrow>
		<mo>(</mo><mn>2.8</mn> <mo>×</mo><msup>
			<mn>10</mn>
			<mn>−8</mn>
		</msup> <mtext> Ω·m</mtext><mo>)</mo>

		<mo>(</mo><mfrac>
			<mrow>
				<mn>50</mn> <mtext> mm</mtext>

			</mrow>
		</mfrac><mo>)</mo>
		<mo>≈</mo> <mn>560</mn> <mtext> mΩ</mtext>
	</mrow>
	<mtext>,</mtext>
</math>
which was in decent agreement with the half-ohm or so i read and would indicate
that contact resistance introduced via the copper was negligible. this is, of
course, assuming i had a correct estimate of the leaf thickness...

<h3 id="preamp">transformer <i>&amp;</i> preamp</h3>

i didn&#39;t follow horowitz <i>&amp;</i> hill&#39;s proposition, and used a
transformer to make the requisite low noise floor easier to achieve. most
likely this only somewhat helped, because my apartment has <i>no earth
ground</i> and i suspect much of the noise i&#39;m seeing is magnetic interference
from my other equipment, but whatever.

<p>
my preamp consisted of a lundahl <sc>ll</sc>2913 1:31 transformer from <a href="https://geistnote.com/lundahl-ll2913-1-37-with-optional-pcb/">geistnote</a>
and a simple differential stage afterwards, using a capacitance multiplier with
a big power transistor to clean up any remaining supply noise, for a total
voltage gain of around 65 dB. exact details are left as an exercise to the
reader. mostly because i don&#39;t feel like drawing a schematic. ;)

</p><h2 id="results">results</h2>

informally: the damn thing worked! and sounded good, too: comments from folks i
know centered around “it sounds like i&#39;m in the room with you.” it
also picked up my relatively deep voice well, which i&#39;m really happy about
— ribbon tensioning is apparently an art and i am an engineer, so i&#39;m
glad i got it close to right after a few tries.

<h3 id="further">further things to try</h3>
if anyone wants to:
<ol>
	<li>
		see what happens with different foil thickness (of course),
	</li>
	<li>
		try different ribbon geometry (maybe narrower would raise the
		output higher, due to higher flux density?),
	</li>
	<li>
		come up with a better method of hum cancellation for the ribbon
		leads, such as running a thin wire <i>right</i> next to the
		ribbon,
	</li>
</ol>
and perhaps get the device professionally evaluated like an actual acoustic
engineer.
