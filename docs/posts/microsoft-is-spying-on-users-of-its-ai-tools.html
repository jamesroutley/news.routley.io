    <h1>Microsoft Is Spying on Users of Its AI Tools</h1>

		<p>Microsoft announced that it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/14/us-adversaries-using-artificial-intelligence-boost-hacking-efforts/">caught</a> Chinese, Russian, and Iranian hackers using its AI tools—presumably coding tools—to improve their hacking abilities.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-insider/reports/cyber-signals/cyber-signals-issue-6-navigating-cyberthreats-and-strengthening-defenses/">report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In collaboration with OpenAI, we are sharing threat intelligence showing detected state affiliated adversaries—tracked as Forest Blizzard, Emerald Sleet, Crimson Sandstorm, Charcoal Typhoon, and Salmon Typhoon—using LLMs to augment cyberoperations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The only way Microsoft or OpenAI would know this would be to spy on chatbot sessions. I’m sure the terms of service—if I bothered to read them—gives them that permission. And of course it’s no surprise that Microsoft and OpenAI (and, presumably, everyone else) are spying on our usage of AI, but this confirms it.</p>
