    <p>A friend from work messaged me today that they had a hard time because they had used <code>var c chan int</code> instead of <code>c := make(chan int)</code> in their Go code.</p>
<p>I responded by saying that I usually have one rule of thumb i.e. to always use of <code>make()</code> whenever I need a channel or map. That way I can be very sure that I can use those immediately.</p>
<p>They added that the surprising thing was it didn’t panic the program rather they ended up with an infinite loop that ran silently. I got more intrigued about the situation. So many questions started popping up in my mind. Why was I not able to catch it in the code review? Why was there no linter rule that could catch this? What is the point of having a nil channel in Go if I am brainwashing myself to always use <code>make()</code>?</p>
<p>I went on to get some answers and here they are!</p>
<h2 id="Nil-channel"><a href="#Nil-channel" title="Nil channel"></a>Nil channel</h2><p>It is just a channel assigned to nil value.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br/></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>var</span> c <span>chan</span> <span>int</span></span><br/></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Nothing wrong with it!</p>
<h2 id="Send-to-a-nil-channel"><a href="#Send-to-a-nil-channel" title="Send to a nil channel"></a>Send to a nil channel</h2><p>When you try to send to a nil channel. </p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>var</span> c <span>chan</span> <span>int</span></span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>You get a deadlock.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h2 id="Receive-from-a-nil-channel"><a href="#Receive-from-a-nil-channel" title="Receive from a nil channel"></a>Receive from a nil channel</h2><p>When you try to receive a value from a nil channel</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>var</span> c <span>chan</span> <span>int</span></span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>You again get a deadlock.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h2 id="Send-and-Receive"><a href="#Send-and-Receive" title="Send and Receive"></a>Send and Receive</h2><p>Now let us try doing both from a nil channel.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>package</span> main</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>This ended up with deadlock too.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>But my friend mentioned they ran into an infinite loop and not a deadlock. How so?</p>
<h2 id="The-for-select-construct"><a href="#The-for-select-construct" title="The for select construct"></a>The <code>for select</code> construct</h2><p>My immediate suspicion was a <code>for select</code> construct instead of <code>for range</code> construct in the above program.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Now that leads to an infinite loop without printing anything! Because <code>select</code> seems to not execute the <code>case i := &lt;-c</code> block when <code>c</code> is a nil channel. What can it do after all? It can’t really receive anything from an un-initialized nil channel, right? So it ignores the <code>case</code> block and always runs the <code>default</code> block again and again.</p>
<h2 id="Initialized-channel"><a href="#Initialized-channel" title="Initialized channel"></a>Initialized channel</h2><p>Now let us initialize the channel by using <code>make(chan int)</code> instead of <code>var c chan int</code> to see how our dear friend <code>select</code> behaves.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It was again an infinite loop, but this time the output was different. </p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>$ go run main.go | head -n 10</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>The zeros took over the output. I had to pipe the output to <code>head</code> to stop the program from running infinitely and at the same time collect some sample output.</p>
<p>What are these zeros? Where are they coming from?</p>
<p>Those are arising from the <code>case i := &lt;-c</code> block of the select. When the channel is not nil, our select statement attempts to receive a value. That results in printing <code>1 2 3</code>, the three values that were sent to the channel. When we close a channel, all we get is the zero value. Hence we are getting zeros after that.</p>
<p>Is there a way to check if a channel is closed? yes, there is.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>for</span> {</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>We avoided printing zeros, but it is still leading to an infinite loop. Because the select is alternating between <code>case</code> and <code>default</code> blocks and continuously executes them.</p>
<p>Let us get rid of <code>default</code>.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>for</span> {</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>That didn’t prevent the infinite loop, our friend <code>select</code> is going on and on choose the <code>case i, ok := &lt;-c</code> block and performing the if condition that evaluates to false always as the channel is closed after sending 3.</p>
<h2 id="The-lesson"><a href="#The-lesson" title="The lesson"></a>The lesson</h2><p>How do we avoid the infinite loop? Remember how the select statement ignored the <code>case</code> block when my friend accidentally used the nil channel instead of an initialized channel at the start of this post? That is exactly what we need to <strong>disable</strong> the case in the <code>select</code> statement.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>for</span> {</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Now we are out of an infinite loop but are hitting a deadlock after the channel is closed.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Because after we <strong>disable</strong> the case, the <code>select</code> statement essentially reduces to an empty <code>select</code> clause.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>package</span> main</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Makes the go routine sleep forever, there is no case statement that it can listen to for receiving a message.</p>
<p>The core lesson however is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nil channels are useful for disabling <code>case</code> blocks of <code>select</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I kind of arrived at this lesson in a weird way, but <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9bEg2A4jsw">this just for func episode</a> teaches it in a beautiful way. (Thanks Campoy if you are reading this!)</p>
<p>This is particularly useful when you are dealing with multiple channels in different cases of a <code>select</code> and if you want to diable the case blocks one by one when those channels are no longer needed. Going to copy-paste the example from that justforfunc episode to capture the idea.</p>
<p>The problem is to merge values coming from two channels and output them in another channel.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Now the <code>merge</code> routine could listen on both the channels and disable the case for a channel after it is closed to make sure that we don’t spend any more CPU time on that case.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>func</span> <span>merge</span><span>(a, b &lt;-<span>chan</span> <span>int</span>)</span> &lt;-<span>chan</span> <span>int</span></span> {</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Beautiful, right? </p>
<p>Now back to our problem.</p>
<h2 id="The-solution"><a href="#The-solution" title="The solution"></a>The solution</h2><p>Let me solve the rest of the problem just for closure.</p>
<p>One way would be to break to an <code>outer</code> label as shown below. That way, </p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>And finally, we get</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>NOTE: this would work without the <code>c = nil</code> statement also.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>outer:</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>If the above is same as the previous solution, what is the point? We noticed that setting a channel to <code>nil</code> is beneficial when we have multiple cases. In here, I could maybe use that as a check for the <code>for</code>.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>I should probably start brainwasing myself to make sure I set the channel to <code>nil</code> after consuming it completely. That way I can avoid the weird break label syntax and disable select cases to get more throughput.</p>
<p>Anyhow I know of a simpler solution. So my recommended solution for my friend would be to</p>
<ul>
<li>initialize the channel with <code>make()</code></li>
<li>use a <code>for range</code> construct instead of <code>for select</code> construct.</li>
</ul>
<p>That would look like:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h2 id="A-proverb"><a href="#A-proverb" title="A proverb"></a>A proverb</h2><p>The example that I gave was a very “trimmed down” version of what my friend was trying to accomplish in a real-world system. He was trying to consume a channel and split the messages into two other channels. The miss was failing to <em>initialize</em> the channels where the split was occurring.</p>
<p>On the other end, we learned from the justforfunc example that, when we try to merge two channels into one, we could start setting the consumed channel(s) to nil.</p>
<p>This is provoking me to make up <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://go-proverbs.github.io/">a Go proverb</a> of my own 😅 Please excuse me if it sounds bad! You have come so far. So you can’t escape from it now - lol :D</p>
<p>~ ~ ~ ~ </p>
<p>“Init when you split, Nil when you merge.”</p>
