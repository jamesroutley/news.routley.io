    <h1>Swiss to vote on preventing cashless society, pressure group says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-testid="paragraph-0">Feb 6 (Reuters) - Swiss citizens will get the chance to try to ensure their economy never becomes cashless, a pressure group said, after collecting enough signatures by Monday to trigger a popular vote on the issue.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-1">The FBS (Free Switzerland Movement) says cash is playing a shrinking role in many economies, as electronic payments become the default for transactions in increasingly digitised societies, making it easier for the state to monitor its citizens&#39; actions.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">It wants a clause added to Switzerland&#39;s currency law, which governs how the central bank and government manage the money supply, stipulating that a &#34;sufficient quantity&#34; of banknotes or coins must always remain in circulation.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">There is no evidence of moves towards a cashless society by Swiss authorities.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">FBS said it had garnered over 111,000 signatures in support of the measure, above the 100,000 needed to trigger a popular vote. Under Switzerland&#39;s system of direct democracy, the proposal would become law if approved by voters, though government and parliament would decide how that law was implemented.</p><div data-testid="Latest Updates" data-variant-id="article-latest-updates"><div><h3 data-testid="Heading">Latest Updates</h3><p data-testid="Body">View 2 more stories<!-- --> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11 7" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M10.413.587a.71.71 0 0 0-1.027 0L5.5 4.474 1.613.587a.71.71 0 0 0-1.027 0 .709.709 0 0 0 0 1.027l4.4 4.4c.147.147.367.22.513.22a.79.79 0 0 0 .513-.22l4.4-4.4a.71.71 0 0 0 0-1.027h.001Z"></path></svg></p></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-5">&#34;It is clear that ... getting rid of cash not only touches on issues of transparency, simplicity or security ... but also carries a huge danger of totalitarian surveillance,&#34; FBS president Richard Koller said on the group&#39;s website.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">He also views Switzerland as a European standard-bearer for the defence of cash, as pushing through such guarantees in the European Union would entail the &#34;almost impossible&#34; process of securing approval from all 27 member states.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Accelerated by the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns, the trend towards increased cashless payments was evident as far back as 2017, when an Ipsos study found more than a third of Europeans and Americans would happily go without cash and 20% pretty much did so already.</p><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by John Stonestreet; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
