    <h1>The End of an Era</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I passed my Bachelor&#39;s examination yesterday. That concludes a few very busy days filled with anxieties. As I&#39;ve detailed <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/A_Summer_Of_Growth.html">previously</a>, I also had to undergo the Recurse Center interviews this weekend, an equally draining experience. Everyone assured me I would be fine, but anxiety does not bow to rational thinking. Yes, it was highly probable I would pass. Yes, there was no possibility for the presentation or the thesis to change my GPA—or rather, the German equivalent of the GPA. But that, too, doesn&#39;t challenge the rule of all-encompassing, sweating, cold-heat-inducing dread.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m done. I did pretty well in the end, even. My GPA is somewhere around <code>3.14</code>—<code>1.86</code> in German grades, and, because we aren&#39;t usually as granular, that is rounded off to <code>2.0</code>. I am okay with that. I actually got an almost perfect grade for my thesis and a perfect grade for the presentation; the worst grades I received were very close to the start of my studies, when I wasn&#39;t as motivated.</p>
<p>All in all, I am happy. This final test concluded a part of my life that I am happy to let go, even though it was one of the happier parts of my life up to this point. I am ready to look for new challenges, without baggage.</p>
