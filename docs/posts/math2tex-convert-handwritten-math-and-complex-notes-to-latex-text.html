    <h1>Show HN: Math2Tex – Convert handwritten math and complex notes to LaTeX text</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN,</p><p>I’m the creator of Math2Tex. I was a PhD student, I spend a huge amount of my time working with LaTeX, especially when dealing with lecture notes, academic papers, and homework. I built *Math2Tex*, a lightweight tool that converts handwritten or printed academic content — especially math formulas — into LaTeX or text</p><p>The Problem:</p><p>I&#39;ve always found it incredibly tedious to manually type out mathematical formulas, especially complex, multi-line equations from my handwritten notes or from a textbook. It&#39;s slow, boring, and I always make syntax errors. I tried some existing tools, but they often struggled with my handwriting or couldn&#39;t handle mixed content (text and formulas together).</p><p>The Solution:</p><p>So, I built Math2Tex to solve my own problem. It’s a straightforward, single-page web app: you upload an image (a photo of your notebook, a screenshot of a PDF, etc.), and it converts the academic content into clean LaTeX code or plain text. You get a real-time preview and can copy the result with one click. My goal was to make the workflow as fast as possible: Snap. Convert. Done.</p><p>You can try it here: [<a href="https://math2tex.com" rel="nofollow">https://math2tex.com</a>](<a href="https://math2tex.com/" rel="nofollow">https://math2tex.com/</a>)</p><p>How is it different from general AI tools like GPT, Claude, etc?</p><p>This is a fair question. While large models can handle this, they are often slow for such a specific task. I wanted something faster and more specialized. Math2Tex uses a lightweight model fine-tuned specifically for academic content recognition.</p><p>In short, think of it as a specialized scalpel versus a Swiss Army knife. For this particular job, it&#39;s generally 3-5x faster and, in my experience, more reliable for complex notations.</p><p>Tech Stack:</p><p>The core OCR engine is a custom-trained model based on a transformer architecture, fine-tuned on a large dataset of both printed and handwritten academic material. It&#39;s all deployed on Vercel.</p><p>*It&#39;s free to use.* This is still an early version, and I&#39;m sure there are plenty of bugs and areas for improvement. The recognition might not be perfect, especially with very messy handwriting or some obscure symbols.</p><p>I would be incredibly grateful for your feedback. Whether you’re a student, researcher, or someone who’s fought with LaTeX input. Feedback on both the tool and the approach would be really helpful.</p><p>Thanks!</p></div></td></div></div>
