    <h1>Apple is reportedly spending ‘millions of dollars a day’ training AI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Apple is investing millions of dollars per day into artificial intelligence, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-boosts-spending-to-develop-conversational-ai">a new report from <em>The Information</em></a><em>. </em>The company is reportedly working on multiple AI models across several teams.</p><p>Apple’s unit that works on conversational AI is called “Foundational Models,” per <em>The Information</em>’s reporting. It has “around 16” members, including several former Google engineers. It’s helmed by John Giannandrea, Apple’s head of AI, who was hired in 2018 to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17195076/google-ai-chief-john-giannandrea-joining-apple-machine-learning-siri">help improve Siri</a>. (Giannandrea has reportedly “expressed skepticism to colleagues about the potential usefulness of chatbots powered by AI language models.”) </p><p>Additional teams at Apple are also working on artificial intelligence, per <em>The Information.</em> A Visual Intelligence unit is developing an image generation model, and another group is researching “multimodal AI, which can recognize and produce images or video as well as text.” </p><p>These models could serve a variety of purposes. A chatbot is in the works that would “interact with customers who use AppleCare”; another would make it easier to automate multistep tasks with Siri.</p><p>Those involved in its development tell <em>The Information</em> that Apple’s most advanced LLM, known internally as Ajax GPT, has been trained on “more than 200 billion parameters” and is more powerful than OpenAI’s GPT-3.5, the foundation of the initial version of ChatGPT that rolled out last year. This model was initially created for internal use, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">previous reporting from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> and remains fairly locked down within the company.</p><p>Apple has not returned a request for comment on this report. </p></div></div></div>
