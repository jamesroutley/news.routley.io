    <h1>14 Takeaways from One Year of Risk Musings</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>Just about a year ago, I started posting weekly on </span><em>Risk Musings. </em><span>(I made an </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/welcome-to-risk-musings" rel="">initial post</a><span> in March 2022, then thought about it and built up a backlog of essays before starting in earnest.) </span></p><p><span>I wasn’t sure if I’d keep going. It was an experiment. But fifty-two weeks later, I’ve wandered all over the risk map, with essays ranging from the </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/lawyers-and-the-vietnam-war-draft" rel="">Vietnam War</a><span> to </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/why-linux-succeeded-resilience-of" rel="">Linux</a><span> to </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/dinosaurs-insects-soil-and-the-end" rel="">climate feedback loops</a><span> to </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/possible-paths-for-ai-regulation" rel="">AI regulation</a><span> to </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/retrocession-roulette-when-climate" rel="">insurance retrocession</a><span> to </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/system-dynamics-of-a-bank-run" rel="">bank runs</a><span> and beyond, and have no desire to stop. </span></p><p>So, I hope you’ll stick with me and enjoy the various twists and turns. I’ll be digging deeper into system dynamics modeling this summer and hope to share some of what I learn with you. I’m attending some information security conferences and (separately!) trying to figure out an AI risk proof-of-concept. I hope to write some more lighthearted essays too. </p><p><span>For now, here are some key principles and themes covered in the first year of </span><em>Risk Musings</em><span>: </span></p><ol><li><p><span>The goal of risk management is not to eliminate risk; it is to increase </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/resilience-is-the-core-risk-discipline" rel="">resilience</a><span> to an acceptable level. </span></p></li><li><p>To identify risks early, before they escalate into catastrophes: look for anomalies that are suddenly widespread in small numbers, and that seem relatively ignored or dismissed. Then overreact rather than under-react to get risks under control before they spread like wildfires. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/the-risks-you-dont-see-the-dark-matter" rel="">Ask what questions </a><em><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/the-risks-you-dont-see-the-dark-matter" rel="">aren’t </a></em><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/the-risks-you-dont-see-the-dark-matter" rel="">answered</a><span> by the data you have available to you, then increase your resilience if you’re uncomfortable with the unknowns you’ve identified.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The best </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/types-of-risk-symmetry-asymmetry" rel="">types of risk</a><span> to </span><em>take</em><span> are those favoring the upside (whether limited or unlimited) and with bounded and tolerable downside. </span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/a-system-dynamics-primer-drawing" rel="">Systems thinking and system dynamics can help identify leverage points</a><span>—places where a small change can cause big and beneficial changes throughout a system—especially via simulation modeling. </span></p></li><li><p><span>While models shouldn’t capture </span><em>every </em><span>part of a system, they often leave out important factors. For example, demographics are powerful and are driving </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/why-cant-we-have-a-strong-labor-market" rel="">strong employment numbers</a><span> and </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/to-fight-inflation-build-starter" rel="">housing shortages</a><span> in the US. Population aging and life-stage trends, immigration trends, and disability and illness trends should be factored into models, since markets don’t operate in isolation. </span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/opportunity-and-hope" rel="">Opportunity and hope</a><span> are leverage points. People need them and will seek them out however they can if current systems aren’t providing enough of them. </span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/emerging-risks-and-smart-regulation" rel="">Good regulation and bad regulation</a><span>, and good controls and bad controls, are differentiated by their attributes. Getting good regulation and good controls in place is hard but feasible. </span></p></li><li><p><span>Risk increases whenever controls lag behind capabilities. For critical areas like nuclear weapons and (</span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/the-two-phases-of-ai-evolution" rel="">eventually</a><span>) AI, </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/agi-existential-risk-persists-despite" rel="">controls need to catch up with, keep pace with, and eventually outpace capabilities</a><span>. This may mean periodic slowdowns or even drawing a “stop here” line. We’ve done it before, and we can do it again. </span></p></li><li><p><span>Regulation can be hard to discuss because its dynamics are complex. For example, small business is often over-regulated and big business is often under-regulated. That makes it hard to talk about “regulation” as an overarching entity. Also, some small businesses are exceptions because they work with critical technology and therefore </span><em>should </em><span>be regulated. Regulation is situation-dependent and criticality-dependent. </span></p></li><li><p><span>To get people and organizations united to abandon a harmful approach or product en masse, ready, attractive, and profitable substitutes must be available. This is not optional. It applies to fossil fuels, </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/incentives-for-victory-on-climate" rel="">CFCs</a><span>, consumption-based lifestyles, social media, and </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/bad-pr-can-spark-change-but-not-always" rel="">more</a><span>. Replacing “something” with “nothing” or with “something far inferior” rarely works. Incentives play a major role and likely determine the success of most initiatives. </span></p></li><li><p><span>Return-on-investment (ROI) calculations discount far-future costs and impacts indiscriminately, but </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/consequence-weighted-roi-a-first" rel="">unacceptable consequences merit a different weighting</a><span>. (Yes, defining “unacceptable” is the hardest part!)</span></p></li><li><p>Near-misses are incredibly valuable for getting people to share information about risks and coordinate to reduce them across industries or even globally. Incentives are usually aligned: people look good within their company and among their peers for stopping risk from manifesting, and everyone gets to reduce risk as a result. Incident reporting can be trickier because there may be organizational or cultural incentives not to share, to avoid blame, to get promoted, to create “not-an-incident” categories such as “events” to avoid reporting, and so on.</p></li><li><p><span>Risk management victory is often silent. </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/the-silence-of-risk-management-victory" rel="">It’s still victory</a><span>.   </span></p></li></ol><p>I’m excited about the coming year, with all its risks and challenges and possibilities. Onward, and thanks for reading!</p><p>Stephanie</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
