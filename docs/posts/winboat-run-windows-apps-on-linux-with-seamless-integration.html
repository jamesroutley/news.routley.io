After making a series of funny faces and letting out a big yawn, he was stuffed into the fabric pouch and Turtle wrapped his flippers around him. “I feel so close to Tuala, much closer than when he’s in my shell.” Koala just smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>She stretched out one of her paws, and Turtle took it. They started walking, very slowly, so as not to disturb the new life that had joined them, towards all their favorite places, to share all their favorite things with their new favorite being.</p>
