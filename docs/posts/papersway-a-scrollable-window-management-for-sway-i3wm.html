<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This is an implementation of PaperWM-like scrollable window management
for Sway/i3wm.
If you like Sway/i3wm’s commitments to stability, avoiding scope creep etc.
but dislike the window management model, papersway might be of interest.</p>

<p>On each workspace, windows are arranged in a row.  By default, two of the
windows in the row are visible at a time, and you can move left and right in
the row to display other windows.  Opening a new window pushes one of the
visible windows off the screen to make room, and closing a window pulls in a
window to fill the space.  You can reorder the windows.</p>

<p>There is a display of the row of workspaces in the bar,
e.g. <tt> ‡ <b>‡ ‡</b> ‡ </tt>.  Here, the focused workspace has four windows,
and the middle two are the ones currently visible.  If the third window has
focus and we open another window, then the second window will be pushed off to
make room, and we will get <tt> ‡ ‡ <b>‡ ‡</b> ‡ </tt>.  The third window
remains visible, but moves to the left side of the display.</p>

<p>There are commands to change the number of visible windows; toggle <em>monocle
mode</em>, in which the focused window occupies all visible columns; and jump to a
<em>fresh workspace</em>, which means a new, empty workspace occurring immediately
after the currently focused workspace.  E.g. if you have two workspaces,
<tt><b>1</b> 2</tt> and you request a fresh workspace, the second workspace
will be renamed out of the way, leaving you with <tt>1 <b>2</b> 3</tt> and no
windows visible.</p>
