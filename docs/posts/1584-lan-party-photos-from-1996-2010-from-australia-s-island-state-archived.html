    <h1>1584 LAN party photos from 1996 – 2010 from Australia&#39;s island state archived</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://issung.com/assets/img/lan.jpg"><img src="https://issung.com/assets/img/lan.jpg" alt="A beautiful photo from Dark-Media LAN X7" loading="lazy"/></a></p><p>In July 2023 I was reminiscing about a thing of the past, large-scale public LAN parties. I remember them being a semiregular occurrence around Tasmania, only attending a couple in my young age before they disappeared. I wondered if I could find some photos of these events to help the memories come back clearer. After some googling of vague memories I was able to find the name of an old group that organised LAN parties called “Dark-Media”. Using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine I was able to find their old site, and a photo album page, but sadly none of the images had been scraped.</p><p>After trying a few other timestamps and a few more web searches I sadly couldn’t find anything. As a last ditch effort I made a few posts on various forums, including the long dormant Dark-Media Steam group, then I forgot about it all, until 2 months ago! Someone reached out and was able to get me into a small private Facebook group, once in I could see I had gotten more than I bargained for! I was just looking for Dark-Media photos, but found another regular LAN I had forgotten about, and photos from even more LANs from the late 90s. I was able to scrape all the photos and now upload them to <a href="https://archive.org/details/@issung/uploads">archive.org</a> where they can hopefully live forever.</p><p>Now that these albums are publicly available I hope that people that were involved in these events can find them, enjoy viewing them and reminiscing. As for people who weren’t involved, enjoy looking at the history, the progression of technology &amp; video games (and even the food &amp; fashion) and maybe get inspired to organise a new LAN event!</p><h2 id="albums"><span>Albums</span><a href="#albums"><i></i></a></h2><p>In total there are 2 videos &amp; 1584 photos.</p><p>When viewing an album page please allow some time for the embedded Internet Archive viewers to load.</p><ul><li><a href="https://issung.com/lanalbums-misc">Miscellaneous</a> 1996 - 2002, 1 Video, 19 Albums, 240 Photos<ul><li>Contains media from: Quakenight, Murderer’s LAN, Terra Fracta, Fragmania, Club Shub, Nexus, Uni Lan Club</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://issung.com/lanalbums-bfg">BFG LAN</a> 2001 - 2002, 8 Albums, 358 Photos</li><li><a href="https://issung.com/lanalbums-darkmedia">Dark-Media</a> 2004 - 2010, 1 Video, 13 Albums, 986 Photos</li></ul></div><div><div><p> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</p></div></div></div>
