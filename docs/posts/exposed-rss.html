<p>I get sites not having an “RSS” for “Feed” link on their website while actually having an RSS feed. I don’t like it, but I get it. Maybe they picked an off-the-shelf theme that doesn’t have that. Maybe they just forgot. Maybe they even don’t want to. </p>
<p>I somehow never considered sites that have an RSS feed that don’t expose it in the HTML. <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/please-expose-your-rss/">As Robb Knight says</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is called RSS auto-discovery and is a standard way to expose RSS feeds to help <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-autodiscovery">browsers and other software to automatically find a site’s RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>Like the standard link, a lot of sites were also missing this. This is (at least as a first step) what feed reeders like <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> will use to automatically find a feed when you paste in a URL. If you have an RSS feed, you should have the following in the <code>head</code> of your website:</p>

<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-1" data-shcb-language-name="HTML, XML" data-shcb-language-slug="xml"><span><code><span>&lt;<span>link</span> <span>rel</span>=<span>&#34;alternate&#34;</span> <span>type</span>=<span>&#34;application/rss+xml&#34;</span> <span>title</span>=<span>&#34;My Cool Website&#34;</span> <span>href</span>=<span>&#34;https://example.com/feed.xml&#34;</span> /&gt;</span>


<span>&lt;<span>link</span> <span>rel</span>=<span>&#34;alternate&#34;</span> <span>type</span>=<span>&#34;application/atom+xml&#34;</span> <span>title</span>=<span>&#34;My Cool Website&#34;</span> <span>href</span>=<span>&#34;https://example.com/atom.xml&#34;</span> /&gt;</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-1"><span>Code language:</span> <span>HTML, XML</span> <span>(</span><span>xml</span><span>)</span></small></pre>
<p>I typically don’t even bother looking for a feed link. If I can smell that your site has a feed and I want to subscribe to it, I just chuck your homepage URL into my feed reader “Add” function and let it find what it needs. If it doesn’t find one I’m like <em>oh well bummer</em>. </p>
<p>So yeah — if you’re going to bother having a feed, or get one for free, make sure you’ve got that <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in place or anybody like me will assume you don’t even have one. </p>
