    <h1>Writing From a Learning Firehose</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="Writing-From-a-Learning-Firehose">

<p>I’m attending the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> (remotely).</p>
<p>I value writing things down because I don’t trust my memory to retain the information that I’ve learned.
Writing everything down from the diversity of people and the pace of learning from the recurse center is difficult.</p>
<p>I had a great conversation about how to write about the things that you’re learning or working on.<label for="fn1"></label>

<span><span>Special thank you to Aditya, Mike, and Rachel for their generous ideas!</span>
</span>

These are some of my takeaways from that conversation.</p>
<section id="Spool-Brain-to-Disk">
<h2>Spool Brain to Disk</h2>
<p>Or, take notes as you go.</p>
<p>Aditya uses git commit messages to record his thoughts in the moment.
Anything that would want to refer back to later, ends up in the git messages.
It acts an append-only buffer, timestamped with when specific notes were written.</p>
<p>I plan to use <a href="https://github.com/notes/jrnl"><code>jrnl</code></a> to do the same, with a custom journal for a writing project I’m working on.</p>

<section id="Lower-the-Bar">
<h2>Lower the Bar</h2>
<p>Write less and be okay with it.</p>
<p>Rachel suggested writing for 5 minutes, 1 minute. Make it a tiny habit to start writing.</p>
<p>Mike uses writing as accountability. A short summary of what he did posted in a public blog post.</p>
<p>In both cases, the lesson is to write less, and to be okay with hitting publish sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>I plan to use these suggestions to write about what I learn.</p>
