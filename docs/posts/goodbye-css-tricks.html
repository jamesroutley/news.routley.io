    <h1>Goodbye, CSS-Tricks</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
									<div>
<p>I woke up yesterday to the news that DigitalOcean has cut a bunch of jobs from the payroll. It <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/15/digitalocean_layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sounds like</a> a pretty big wave, and yes, my job was lopped off with it.</p>



<p>This is my first rodeo with sweeping layoffsâ€¦ or even losing a job. I always expected Iâ€™d feel devastated if something like this were to ever happen, but Iâ€™ve gotta admit itâ€™s all good. Anyone who knows me well knows that I never have <em>one</em> job, but many eggs in a number of baskets. That might be influencing my feelings a wee smidge. I realize not everyone is in the same boat.</p>



<p>Whatâ€™s actually weighing heaviest in my mind is CSS-Tricks. Itâ€™s <a href="https://geoffgraham.me/im-joining-the-digitalocean-team/">the only reason</a> I was at DigitalOcean in the first place. Iâ€™m sad that Iâ€™ll no longer be editing or writing for the site, and Iâ€™m still processing that I didnâ€™t realize yesterday would be my last day with it. I no longer hold the keys to the castle and my digital fingerprints are being dusted off the door handles as I type. </p>



<p>Alas, things change. Goodbye, website. Goodbye, all you dang talented writers who let me mangle your words. Goodbye, all you typos from umpteen years ago that I canâ€™t unsee and wake me up at 3 a.m. in a cold sweat.</p>



<p>Iâ€™m not crying. <em>Youâ€™re</em> crying.</p>



<p>But seriously, the pleasure of working with CSS-Tricks <a href="https://geoffgraham.me/thank-you-chris/">has been all mine</a>. I still canâ€™t believe I was ever paid to read drafts and diddle around with codeâ€¦ for eight years!</p>



<p>And, hey, if youâ€™re still with me and reading this, thereâ€™s a small ocean of talented technical writers, editors, content strategists, and developers who are now looking for work. You canâ€™t do much better than to pluck someone from that bunch if youâ€™re in a hiring position.</p>



<p>(What am I up to? Of course, thanks for asking! I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m already working on my Masterâ€™s Degree in Education. Iâ€™m doing that to support the teaching I do â€” front-end development and WordPress development â€” at Long Beach City College and Front Range Community College. I still freelance a bit, so I guess I could bump that up a bit more if, perhaps, you want to <a href="https://geoffgraham.me/contact/">reach out and work together</a>. Letâ€™s make something!)</p>



<p>Oh, and speaking of hiring, it appears DigitalOcean is still in full hiring mode if youâ€™re in the market for work. Well, according to the signature in this auto-reply.</p>

<p>Long live CSS-Tricks! ðŸ¤ž</p>
