    <h1>TGV unveils high-speed trains of the future</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><cite>(CNN) — </cite><span>Welcome to the future of European high-speed rail travel. </span></p><p><span>French railway company SNCF and train manufacturer Alstom have unveiled the first completed TGV M, a next-generation high-speed double-decker train that features a longer, more aerodynamic nose -- perfect for hurtling across the French countryside.  </span></p><p><span>Alstom dubbed the new train &#34;the TGV of the future.&#34; TGV stands for Train à Grand Vitesse, meaning high-speed train.</span></p><p><span>This swanky new design will premiere on the Paris rail network in 2024 and across the country over the following 10 years. </span></p><p><span><h3>Bigger and better </h3></span></p><p><span>TGV is one of the world&#39;s most famous high-speed train brands and has been a staple of European rail travel since the early 1980s.</span></p><p><span>Back in 2018, SNCF, the state-owned French railway company which controls TGV, ordered 100 TGV M trains (also known as Avelia Horizon trains) at a cost of 2.7 billion euros (around $2.7 billion). An additional 15 trains were ordered in August 2022. </span></p><p><span>The majority of the trains will operate within France, but Alstom has said 15 will ride the rails internationally.</span></p><p><span>TGV M will operate at the same maximum speed as the previous generation of TGV trains -- 350 kilometers per hour (nearly 220 mph).</span></p><p><span>&#34;In 2022, we don&#39;t want to go faster,&#34; said Alstom spokesperson Philippe Molitor told <a href="https://cnn.com/travel" target="_blank">CNN Travel</a>, explaining that the goal instead is high speed trains that accommodate more people while consuming less energy. </span></p><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F220915092847-02-tgv-train-france.jpg" alt="The new TGV M train, unveiled at the Alstom plant in La Rochelle, western France, is billed as the next generation of European high speed train travel."/></p><p>The new TGV M train, unveiled at the Alstom plant in La Rochelle, western France, is billed as the next generation of European high speed train travel.</p><p>Xavier Leoty/AFP/Getty Images</p></div><p><span>TGV M trains don&#39;t just have 40.5-centimeter (15.9-inch) longer noses than their predecessors, they&#39;re bigger all round. Roomier carriage interiors can accommodate up to 740 seats, compared to the current maximum of 634. </span></p><p><span>TGV Ms also got what manufacturer Alstom calls &#34;unprecedented modularity,&#34; meaning the train&#39;s interior configuration can be easily adjusted. A carriage can be converted from second class to first class and back again, or adapted to allow space for oversized luggage or bikes. There will also be dedicated on-board passenger social areas to offer variation and flexibility on longer journeys. </span></p><p><span>According to Alstom, the design improves TGV&#39;s current energy efficiency and carbon footprint, with 97% of the train&#39;s components now recyclable. </span></p><p><span>It also boasts better accessibility -- there will be a lifting platform to allow wheelchair users to independently board the train, and an on-board sound system to aid visually impaired travelers.  </span></p><p><span>Larger windows will make the most of views while the TGV&#39;s lighting will adapt depending on natural light outside.</span></p><p><span>In a statement, Alstom describes a &#34;train set whose sensors continuously transmit thousands of pieces of data enabling the train to be examined in real time from every angle to optimize maintenance and availability.&#34; </span></p><p><span><h3>From design to reality </h3></span></p><p><span>TGV M&#39;s futuristic elements will necessitate some infrastructure changes on France&#39;s rail network -- for example, some station stop signs will need to be moved so that they&#39;re not obscured by the new train&#39;s longer nose. </span></p><p><span>Train drivers were actively involved in the design process, specifically the interior of the driver&#39;s cab, says Alstom.</span></p><p><span>&#34;Using virtual reality goggles, a hundred drivers were given a virtual tour of the cab, with a choice of three space designs,&#34; the company says.</span></p><p><span>With the first completed train unveiled, the next step is what Alstom describes as &#34;a long period of testing&#34; -- the first test phase will start in the Czech Republic at the end of 2022.  </span></p><p><span>Top photo by Xavier Leoty/AFP/Getty Images</span></p></div></div></div>
