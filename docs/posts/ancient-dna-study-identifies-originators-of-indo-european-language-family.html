            Ancient DNA locates the geographic origin of Proto-Indo-Europeans and Proto-Anatolians and describes their early migrations out of the Caucasus Lower Volga and North Pontic regions of present-day Russia and Ukraine. The languages these cultures brought with them are depicted in this artist’s rendition as spokes of a wooden wheel, a technology that facilitated their dispersal. Some spokes are intact, denoting living languages; others are broken, hinting at those lost or known only from archaeology. The word for “horse,” an important animal in Indo-European culture, adorns the rim in diverse scripts from across Europe and Asia. A scattering of red ochre represents a part of early Indo-European burial rites. Image: Oliver Uberti

        <p>A pair of landmark studies has genetically identified the originators of the massive Indo-European family of 400-plus languages. </p><p>Results of the international ancient-DNA studies, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08531-5">published Feb. 5 in <em>Nature</em></a><span> and supported in part by the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation,</span> place these linguistic pioneers within the borders of current-day Russia during the Eneolithic or Copper Age about 6,500 years ago. They were spread from the steppe grasslands along the lower Volga River to the northern foothills of the Caucasus Mountains.</p><p><a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/sign-email-communications"><strong>Get more HMS news here</strong></a></p><p>The discovery marks a collaborative triumph that builds on decades of work by linguists, archaeologists, and geneticists.</p><p>It provides the missing piece from the century-old “steppe hypothesis,” which positions the birthplace of Indo-European languages — and their precursor, Proto-Indo-European, which predated writing — on the Eurasian steppe, where Russia and Ukraine stand today. </p><p>Earlier work had pointed to the ancient Yamnaya people of the steppe as the originators of Proto-Indo-European, but a sticking point was that ancient speakers of one extinct branch of Indo-European languages didn’t have Yamnaya ancestry. Some geneticists, including co-senior author <a href="https://heb.fas.harvard.edu/people/david-reich">David Reich</a> of Harvard Medical School and Harvard University, hypothesized that an even older population was the ultimate source. The new studies identify that population as the Caucasus Lower Volga people.</p>
