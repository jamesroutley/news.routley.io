And it was compact enough that I could see the entire range from beginning to end.</p></div></div><div><div><p>These are the Sutter Buttes, a cluster of volcanic domes about 55 miles northwest of Sacramento and the remains of the Central Valley’s lone, and now dormant, volcano. The <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3024/fs2011-3024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey</a> calls the Buttes “a remarkable geographic and geologic feature” emerging from what are otherwise flatlands extending out for miles.</p><p>For generations, the Buttes have also been a beloved landmark for locals.</p><p>“Coming home from Southern California or Oregon, or Tahoe or San Francisco, there they are, the Sutter Buttes rising mysteriously out of the Sacramento Valley,” one reader, Martha Bunce, who lives in Yuba County, told me. “Around here we say, ‘When you see the Buttes, you know you’re home.’”</p><p>The Sutter Buttes, which over the centuries have also been called the Marysville Buttes, the Middle Mountains and Los Tres Picos, are informally referred to as the world’s smallest mountain range, though that’s <a href="https://www.mynspr.org/news/2019-04-30/are-the-sutter-buttes-really-the-smallest-mountain-range-in-the-world" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more marketing than scientific fact.</a></p><p>The Buttes were formed over a million years ago by oozing lava that pushed up craggy outcroppings from the valley floor. Towering over 2,000 feet tall, the Buttes are arranged in a rough circle with a diameter of 10 miles, covering an area of about 75 square miles.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Buttes were formed over a million years ago by oozing lava that pushed up craggy outcroppings from the valley floor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Hausback/USGS</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>The Buttes have long been a sacred site for Indigenous tribes. The Maidu people, who lived in the Sacramento Valley, believed that the spirits of the dead rested in the Buttes before ascending. “In other words, the portals to the afterlife would have been directly above the Sutter Buttes,” a California park ranger <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/travel/escapes/16adventurer.html" title="">once told The New York Times.</a></p></div><div><div><p>The Maidu and other tribes would also relocate in the winter to the Buttes when the Sacramento Valley would flood, as regularly happened before our modern system of levees and dams. Settlers who arrived in the 19th century had to do the same.</p><p>When the explorer Jedediah Smith passed through California in the winter of 1826, “the water rose so high in the Sacramento valley that he was driven to the Marysville Buttes for a camping place, which he found teeming with elk, antelope and bear that had also sought refuge there,” according to an <a href="https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dxU1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PP6&amp;hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">early history of California.</a> </p><p>Now, the Buttes are mostly on private property, but you can pay for a <a href="https://www.middlemountainhikes.org/hikes-events" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scheduled group hike</a> in the mountains between October and May. Or you can <a href="https://www.middlemountainhikes.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drive around the towering hills</a> in about an hour, as I did recently, following quiet country roads through ranches and groves of trees studded with pink flowers. (I stopped at <a href="https://wildlife.ca.gov/Lands/Places-to-Visit/Gray-Lodge-WA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gray Lodge Wildlife Area</a> along the way to do some bird-watching.)</p><p>You can bike around them, as one reader, Gerald Adams, who lives in Sacramento, did on the morning of the Super Bowl. “The fields of mustard flower and orchards starting to bloom were grand,” Adams told me in an email. “The roads were empty and we saw only one other cyclist.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Waymo’s initial footprint in Los Angeles County will be limited to about 63 square miles, extending from Santa Monica to downtown Los Angeles.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maggie Shannon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The U.C.

The ranking is part of USA Today’s “10Best” series, which includes contests for the best food, activities and local attractions across the country.</p><p>O’Brien’s, which was founded in 1994 in the Kearny Mesa area of San Diego, has made a name for itself by serving rare beers from Belgium and the Russian River Valley in Northern California, and by spotlighting local breweries. The bar is also a favorite watering hole among locals, many of whom helped keep the bar afloat during the pandemic.</p><p>“It’s very humbling that our little pub in our little city was able to pull it off,” Tom Nickel, the bar’s co-owner, told The Union Tribune.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
