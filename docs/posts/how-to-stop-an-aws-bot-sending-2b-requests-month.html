    <h1>Ask HN: How to stop an AWS bot sending 2B requests/month</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have been struggling with a bot– &#39;Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; crawler)&#39; coming from AWS Singapore – and sending an absurd number of requests to a domain of mine, averaging over 700 requests/second for several months now.
Thankfully, CloudFlare is able to handle the traffic with a simple WAF rule and 444 response to reduce the outbound traffic.</p><p>I&#39;ve submitted several complaints to AWS to get this traffic to stop, their typical followup is:
We have engaged with our customer, and based on this engagement have determined that the reported activity does not require further action from AWS at this time.</p><p>I&#39;ve tried various 4XX responses to see if the bot will back off, I&#39;ve tried 30X redirects (which it follows) to no avail.</p><p>The traffic is hitting numbers that require me to re-negotiate my contract with CloudFlare and is otherwise a nuisance when reviewing analytics/logs.</p><p>I&#39;ve considered redirecting the entirety of the traffic to aws abuse report page, but at this scall, it&#39;s essentially a small DDoS network and sending it anywhere could be considered abuse in itself.</p><p>Are there others that have similar experience?</p></div></div></div>
