<p>Days on the road with your pet cooped up may sound like an adventure but can be dangerous for you and your pet. It Sounds like a great and easy idea until you really think about it. Will the weather be an issue? Will hotels along the way allow pets. When needed, can you leave your pet in the car? What does the gas cost? What do the hotels cost? What if the car breaks down?</p>
<p>Do you really want to spend all that time driving?</p>
<p>Not looking so enticing anymore, right?</p></div>

<p>Pet Shippers can be a valuable asset under certain circumstances, but they add additional steps involving additional people handling your pet. They will get your pet to and from the airport, but they are still putting your pet in the cargo hold of the Human Airlines.</p>
<p>Once they drop your pet off, they are no longer directly monitoring your pet. They have no clue where your pet is, in what type of environment, who is handling them, how they are being treated and if they are safe.</p>

<p>First, you have to go shopping for a crate for your pet. Then you have to fit the crate in your car with all your luggage and family, and drive to the airport.</p>
<p>At the airport, you check your pet in at the counter. Your pet is put on the conveyor belt, and off it goes into the black hole of the luggage system.</p>
<p>What happens to your pet now? No one really knows! Where is your pet now? Who is handling your pet? A Cargo Handler? How is your pet being treated? Is your pet on-board with you? Is there anybody to call to get information on how your pet is doing or where your pet is during the trip?.</p>
<p>Do they actually really care?</p></div>
