Phi-4 is the latest member of our Phi family of small language models and demonstrates what’s possible as we continue to probe the boundaries of SLMs. Phi-4 is currently available on </span><a href="https://aka.ms/phi3-azure-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure AI Foundry</a><span data-contrast="auto"> under a Microsoft Research License Agreement (MSRLA) and will be available on </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/microsoft/phi-3-6626e15e9585a200d2d761e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Hugging Face</a><span data-contrast="auto"> next week. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;335559738&#34;:240,&#34;335559739&#34;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Phi-4 Benchmarks</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Phi-4 outperforms comparable and larger models on math related reasoning due to advancements throughout the processes, including the use of high-quality synthetic datasets, curation of high-quality organic data, and post-training innovations. Phi-4 continues to push the frontier of size vs quality. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Phi-4 is particularly good at math problems, for example here are the benchmarks for Phi-4 on math competition problems:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"><br/></span></p>
