    <h1>DDR5 RAM Prices Crashed by 20% in May Alone</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The price of DDR5 RAM has <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/ddr5-memory-prices-plummet/">begun to drop since last quarter</a>; alone, in the last month of May-2022, the price dropped <strong>by 20% </strong>for some kits. We are talking about 6 USD for each Gigabyte for a low-end memory module such as the classic <strong>DDR5-4800 CL40</strong>, the most affordable option available. Access to this new memory standard implies a minimum price of around <strong>189 USD</strong> for 32 GB kits like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Technology-2x16GB-Desktop-KF548C38BBK2-32/dp/B09KCLWW2K/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>Kingston Fury Beast 32GB (2x16GB) 4800Mhz</span></a>.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about a DDR4 RAM with CL16 latencies. The same 32 GB capacity kit price is around <strong>137 USD</strong>, so it is a smarter purchase option, of course, as long as you have or are going to have an Intel processor, Alder Lake (12th Gen), or Intel Raptor Lake (13th Gen) since both DDR4 and DDR5 RAM can be used.</p>

<p>On the opposite side, <strong>the <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/ryzen-7000-series/">Ryzen 7000 series processors</a> based on the AMD AM5 platform </strong>will only support the DDR5 RAM, making the jump to said platform significantly more expensive and more so if we want to acquire high-performance memory modules that outperform DDR4 RAM. Although currently in well-known stores like Amazon, over 3,000 different kits of DDR4 RAM are on sale and only 213 of DDR5 memory, and if we go beyond the conventional 32 GB of RAM @ 4800 MHz CL38, be ready to spend at least <strong>$220</strong>; 5600 MHz CL36 are around <strong>$</strong><strong>290</strong>; the 6200 MHz CL38 for over <strong>$399</strong>; while the most advanced modules already are selling between <strong>$499 and $599</strong>, the new models with low latencies at frequencies above 6000 MHz are not even listed yet!</p>
<p>Yes, DDR5 memory is falling in price, but <strong>DDR4 memory has also suffered price drops</strong>. In both cases, the drops are very slight every week, so it is not expected that DDR5 memory to be affordable in the short term. If you’re looking for a high-end Ryzen 7000 build, be prepared to open your wallet wide for memory that won’t drag down system performance.</p>

<p>Remember that in 2023, with the launch of <strong>Intel</strong> <strong>Meteor Lake</strong>, Intel will complete the transition to a platform that only uses DDR5 memory, so the company hopes that by the end of next year, the prices of DDR5 Ram will be affordable enough to generate more interest.</p>
