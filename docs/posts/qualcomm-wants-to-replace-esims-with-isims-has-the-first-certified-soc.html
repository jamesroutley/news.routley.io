<p>Here&#39;s an interesting bit of news out of Mobile World Congress: <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/02/qualcomm-and-thales-unveil-world-s-first-gsma-compliant-isim-wit">Qualcomm says</a> the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 has been certified as the &#34;world’s first commercially deployable iSIM (Integrated SIM).&#34; What the heck is an iSIM? Didn&#39;t we just go through a SIM card transition with eSIM? We did, but iSIM is better than eSIM. We&#39;ll explain, but the short answer is that iSIM is the next step in the continual march to reduce the size of SIM cards.</p>
<p>OK, so SIM cards are (in the smallest &#34;nano&#34; size) little 12×9 mm plastic cards that you physically stick into your phone. SIM stands for &#34;Subscriber Identity Module,&#34; and these cards mostly just identify you to your cell carrier, allowing your device to be provisioned for the cellular service that you pay a monthly bill for. The idea is that if you buy a new phone, or have multiple phones, you can just move the SIM card over, and—if there aren&#39;t any compatibility problems—your service could be easily moved between phones.</p>
<p>In ye olden days, these cards would store some actual data like contacts and messages, but with the advent of smartphones, all of that moved to the cloud. Today a SIM card can store up to 265KB of data in that 12×9 mm card, which is absolutely horrible data density considering similarly sized MicroSD cards can go up to 1TB, or about 4.2 million times more data. SIM cards are a huge waste of space in an industry that is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/06/if-you-kill-the-headphone-jack-you-need-to-replace-it-with-something-better/">very aggressive</a> about saving space, so they needed to go.</p>
<p>Enter eSIMs, the newish standard that does away with the physical, removable SIM card and instead solders a tiny chip on the motherboard of your phone. These came to the Google Pixel line<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/pixel-2-and-2-xl-review-the-best-android-phone-you-can-buy/3/#h3"> in 2017</a>, the iPhone <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/09/hello-esim-apple-moves-the-iphone-away-from-physical-sims/">in 2018</a>, and some Samsung phones <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/samsung-finally-has-esim-working-in-the-us-first-on-the-note20/">in 2021</a>, and, for a few models, they lived alongside physical cards. A major turning point for most carriers was Apple killing the physical SIM card in 2022 with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/iphone-14-and-14-pro-review-a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-dollars/2/">some iPhone 14 models</a> and going eSIM-only. An eSIM-only device has no removable card at all, and therefore no card slot, simplifying device design, saving space, and removing one possible spot for water ingress. Instead of sticking a hunk of plastic in the phone, you provision your device via some app, usually by signing in to your account with your carrier. eSIMs are a big size savings over physical cards, and the smallest chips are around 2.5×2.3 mm.</p>

<p>eSIMs are still a chip taking up space on your motherboard, and that&#39;s not ideal if you want to squeeze every square millimeter of space out of a phone. The next shrinking step is iSIM—an Integrated Subscriber Identity Module. Rather than a chip on the motherboard, iSIMs are integrated directly onto the SoC. SoC (system on a chip) integration is <em>the</em> technology that makes smartphones possible. Instead of a thousand little chips for things like the CPU, GPU, RAM, modem, and a bunch of other things, everything gets packed into one single do-everything piece of silicon. Individual chips require more space and power thanks to having to make motherboard traces to connect everything and having to deal with chip packages.</p>
<p>Building everything in one chip, with the tiniest transistors you can muster, is the cheapest and most space-efficient and power-efficient way to do things, and now SIM cards are going to disappear into that big block of stuff. iSIMs will be measured in fractions of a millimeter, and as part of the SoC, they will continually shrink every year as chip process nodes hit ever-smaller nm measurements. It sounds like this is the endgame for SIM technology, and besides helping out phones, will be great for evermore space-constrained devices like smartwatches.</p>
<p>Of course, we&#39;ll need carriers to be on board with this, and that&#39;s what Qualcomm&#39;s announcement is mostly about. The iSIM solution in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC—which is shipping now—has been certified by the GSMA, aka the world&#39;s cell carriers. Qualcomm says &#34;the new iSIM is fully compliant with the GSMA Remote SIM Provisioning standard; meaning its subscriptions are remotely manageable through any standard platforms.&#34; That&#39;s the same standard as eSIM, and it&#39;s held to all the same security requirements, so theoretically, any carrier that works with eSIM shouldn&#39;t see a difference between an eSIM and an iSIM. iSIM is still just a hunk of silicon that needs software provisioning—where the silicon lives shouldn&#39;t really matter to your carrier.</p>
<p>Like many Qualcomm SoC components, using iSIM is optional even though it&#39;s built into the chip. All current Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 phones use discrete eSIM chips instead of iSIM. Now that the solution is certified, the wait is on for some phone manufacturer to build iSIM into its next product design.</p>
