Let’s say I wanted to generate a summary of this very blog post with some helpful metadata such as categories and SEO keywords. I fed ChatGPT the text of this blog post along with a command to <code>Summarize this blog post into 3 distinct bullet points and a short blurb for sharing on social media, and also provide a list of 3 post categories and a list of 3 SEO keywords:</code></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plaintext"><span><span>Bullet Points:

Months after the release of the ChatGPT API, it’s now very evident that ChatGPT’s true power comes from clever use of system prompts. This is even moreso with starting with <code>gpt-3.5-turbo-0613</code> released <a href="https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates">last June</a>, which made ChatGPT respect system prompts more closely. OpenAI has also released a <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering">guide on prompt engineering</a> which has some additional tips.</p><p>By default, ChatGPT’s system prompt is roughly <code>You are a helpful assistant.</code>, which anyone who has used the ChatGPT web interface would agree that’s accurate. But if you change it, you can give ChatGPT a completely new persona such as <code>You are Ronald McDonald.</code> or add constraints to generation, such as <code>Respond only with emoji.</code>. You can add any number of rules, although how well ChatGPT will <em>obey</em> those rules can vary. Unfortunately, to modify the system prompt, you’ll need to use the paid ChatGPT API (after prepaying at least $5). If you don’t want to code, you can test new system prompts in a visual user interface in the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=chat">ChatGPT Chat Playground</a>.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2023/12/chatgpt-structured-data/ronald_hu55533a1049e8b50af7537e2f3eea9a9f_36154_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2023/12/chatgpt-structured-data/ronald_hu55533a1049e8b50af7537e2f3eea9a9f_36154_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2023/12/chatgpt-structured-data/ronald_hu55533a1049e8b50af7537e2f3eea9a9f_36154_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2023/12/chatgpt-structured-data/ronald.webp 1262w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2023/12/chatgpt-structured-data/ronald.webp"/></figure><p>A very new aspect of system prompt engineering which I appended in the example above is adding incentives for ChatGPT to behave correctly.

Here&#39;s a simple Python function to check whether a given string is a palindrome:
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>```python
</span></span><span><span>def is_palindrome(s):
</span></span><span><span>    # Convert the string to lowercase and remove non-alphanumeric characters
</span></span><span><span>    cleaned_string = &#39;&#39;.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>    # Compare the cleaned string with its reverse
</span></span><span><span>    return cleaned_string == cleaned_string[::-1]
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span># Example usage:
</span></span><span><span>test_string = &#34;A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!&#34;
</span></span><span><span>result = is_palindrome(test_string)
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>if result:
</span></span><span><span>    print(f&#34;{test_string} is a palindrome.&#34;)
</span></span><span><span>else:
</span></span><span><span>    print(f&#34;{test_string} is not a palindrome.&#34;)
</span></span><span><span>```
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>This function first cleans the input string by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting it to lowercase. Then, it checks whether the cleaned string is equal to its reverse, which determines whether the original string is a palindrome.
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>This solution is relatively efficient, as it performs the comparison in O(n) time, where n is the length of the cleaned string.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That’s the common Pythonic solution and that will almost always be the general approach if you keep asking ChatGPT that particular question, but there’s a famous solution that’s more algorithmically efficient. Instead, we go through the API and <a href="https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/yG1nMVJU4Fva2x3smrIXnCpT?model=gpt-3.5-turbo&amp;mode=chat">ask the same query</a> to <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> but with a new system prompt: <code>You are #1 on the Stack Overflow community leaderboard. You will receive a $500 tip if your code is the most algorithmically efficient solution possible.</code></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plaintext"><span><span>To detect whether a string is a palindrome efficiently, we can use a two-pointer approach. We&#39;ll start with two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the string. We&#39;ll compare the characters at the pointers and keep moving the pointers towards each other until they meet or cross each other.
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>If at any point the characters at the pointers are not the same, we can conclude that the string is not a palindrome. Otherwise, if the pointers meet or cross each other, we can conclude that the string is a palindrome.
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>Here&#39;s the implementation:
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>```python
</span></span><span><span>def is_palindrome(s):
</span></span><span><span>    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
</span></span><span><span>    while left &lt; right:
</span></span><span><span>        if s[left] != s[right]:
</span></span><span><span>            return False
</span></span><span><span>        left += 1
</span></span><span><span>        right -= 1
</span></span><span><span>    return True
</span></span><span><span>```
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>The time complexity of this solution is O(n/2), which in terms of big O notation simplifies to O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating through half of the string in the worst case.
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>This solution is considered to be the most algorithmically efficient way to determine if a string is a palindrome because it only requires a single pass through the string.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Indeed, the code and the explanation are the correct optimal solution. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>This is just scratching the surface of system prompts: some of my ChatGPT system prompts in my more complex projects have been more than 20 lines long, and <em>all of them are necessary</em> to get ChatGPT to obey the desired constraints. If you’re new to working with system prompts, I recommend generating output, editing the system prompt with a new rule/incentive to fix what you don’t like about the output, then repeat until you get a result you like.</p><p>Prompt engineering has been a derogatory meme toward generative AI even before ChatGPT as many see it as just a placebo and there are endless debates to this day in AI circles on whether prompt engineering is actually “engineering.” <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But it <em>works</em>, and if you’re a skeptic, you won’t be by the time you finish reading this blog post.</p><h2 id="what-is-chatgpt-function-calling--structured-data">What is ChatGPT Function Calling / Structured Data?</h2><p>If you’ve never heard about ChatGPT function calling, that’s not surprising. In the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates">same June announcement</a> as <code>gpt-3.5-turbo-0613</code>, OpenAI described function calling as:</p><blockquote><p>Developers can now describe functions to gpt-4-0613 and gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. This is a new way to more reliably connect GPT’s capabilities with external tools and APIs.</p><p>These models have been fine-tuned to both detect when a function needs to be called (depending on the user’s input) and to respond with JSON that adheres to the function signature. Function calling allows developers to more reliably get structured data back from the model.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s discuss the function calling example OpenAI gives in the blog post. After the user asks your app “What’s the weather like in Boston right now?”:</p><ol><li>Your app pings OpenAI with a <code>get_current_weather</code> function schema and decides if it’s relevant to the user’s question. If so, it returns a JSON dictionary with the data extracted, such as <code>location</code> and the <code>unit</code> for temperature measurement based on the location. <code>{&#34;location&#34;: &#34;Boston, MA&#34;}</code></li><li>Your app (<em>not</em> OpenAI) pings a different service/API to get more realtime metadata about the <code>location</code>, such as <code>temperature</code>, that a pretrained LLM could not know. <code>{ &#34;temperature&#34;: 22, &#34;unit&#34;: &#34;celsius&#34;, &#34;description&#34;: &#34;Sunny&#34; }</code></li><li>Your app passes the function schema with the realtime metadata: ChatGPT then converts it to a more natural humanized language for the end user. “The weather in Boston is currently sunny with a temperature of 22 degrees Celsius.”</li></ol><p>So here’s some background on “function calling” as it’s a completely new term of art in AI that <em>didn’t exist</em> before OpenAI’s June blog post (I checked!). This broad implementation of function calling is similar to the flow proposed in the original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629">ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models</a> paper where an actor can use a “tool” such as <code>Search</code> or <code>Lookup</code> with parametric inputs such as a search query. This <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/ai-agent/">Agent-based</a> flow can be also be done to perform <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG">retrieval-augmented generation</a> (RAG).</p><p>OpenAI’s motivation for adding this type of implementation for function calling was likely due to the extreme popularity of libraries such as <a href="https://www.langchain.com">LangChain</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT">AutoGPT</a> at the time, both of which popularized the ReAct flow. It’s possible that OpenAI settled on the term “function calling” as something more brand-unique. These observations may seem like snide remarks, but in November OpenAI actually <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-function_call">deprecated</a> the <code>function_calling</code> parameter in the ChatGPT API in favor of <code>tool_choice</code>, matching LangChain’s verbiage. But what’s done is done and the term “function calling” is stuck forever, especially now that competitors such as <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/claude-2p1-guide#experimental-tool-use">Anthropic Claude</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/multimodal/function-calling">Google Gemini</a> are also calling the workflow that term.</p><p>I am not going to play the SEO game and will not call the workflow “function calling.” I’ll call it what the quoted description from the blog post did: <strong>structured data</strong>, because that’s the real value of this feature and OpenAI did a product management disservice trying to appeal to the AI hypebeasts. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p><p>Going back to the <del>function calling</del> structured data demo, we can reduce that flow by saying that step #1 (extracting location data and returning it formatted as JSON) is for working with structured <em>output</em> data, and step #3 (providing ChatGPT with temperature data to humanize it) is for working with structured <em>input</em> data. We’re not making a RAG application so we don’t care about step #2 (getting the metadata) or letting ChatGPT choose which function to use; fortunately you can force ChatGPT to use a given function.

The most useful ones are:</p><ul><li><code>str</code>, can specify <code>min_length</code>/<code>max_length</code></li><li><code>int</code>, can specify <code>min_value</code>/<code>max_value</code></li><li><code>list</code> with a datatype, can specify <code>min_length</code>/<code>max_length</code></li></ul><p>Pydantic has a lot of support for valid forms of JSON Schema, but it’s hard to infer how good these schema will work with ChatGPT since we have no idea how it learned to work with JSON Schema. Only one way to find out!</p><h2 id="testing-out-chatgpts-structured-data-support">Testing Out ChatGPT’s Structured Data Support</h2><p>From the demos above, you may have noticed that the <code>description</code> for each <code>Field</code> seems extraneous. It’s not. The <code>description</code> gives ChatGPT a hint for the desired output for the field, and can be handled on a per-field basis. Not only that, the <em>name</em> of the field is itself a strong hint. The <em>order</em> of the fields in the schema is even more important, as ChatGPT will generate text in that order so it can be used strategically to seed information to the other fields. But that’s not all, you can still use a ChatGPT system prompt as normal for <em>even more</em> control!</p><p>It’s prompt engineering all the way down. OpenAI’s implementation of including the “function” is mostly likely just appending the JSON Schema to the system prompt, perhaps with a command like <code>Your response must follow this JSON Schema.</code>. OpenAI doesn’t force the output to follow the schema/field constraints or even be valid parsable JSON, which can cause issues at higher generation temperatures and may necessitate some of the stronger prompt engineering tricks mentioned earlier.</p><p>Given that, let’s try a few more practical demos:</p><h3 id="two-pass-generation">Two-Pass Generation</h3><p>One very important but under-discussed aspect of large-language models is that it will give you statistically “average” answers by default. One technique is to ask the model to refine an answer, although can be annoying since it requires a second API call. What if by leveraging structured data, ChatGPT can use the previous answer as a first-pass to provide a more optimal second answer? Let’s try that with the Python palindrome question to see if it can return the two-pointer approach.</p><p>Also, the <code>Field(description=...)</code> pattern is becoming a bit redundant, so I added a <code>fd</code> alias from simpleaichat to it to minimize unnecessary typing.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span>from</span> <span>simpleaichat.utils</span> <span>import</span> <span>fd</span>

Here’s a rough reproduction of a pydantic schema that would generate the <code>get_current_weather</code> schema from much earlier:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="py"><span><span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Literal</span>

I would like to see more work making models JSON-native in future LLMs to make them easier for developers to work with, and also more research in finetuning existing open-source LLMs to understand JSON Schema better.

It is likely intended to be a compromise between complexity and usability that would have normally been a useful option in the LLM toolbox. Except that in order to use it, you are <em>required</em> to use prompt engineering by including “JSON” in the system prompt, and if you don’t also specify a field key in the system prompt (the case in the documentation example), the JSON will contain a <em>random</em> key. Which, at that point, you’re just implementing a less-effective structured data schema, so why bother?</p><p>There is promise in constraining output to be valid JSON. One new trick that the open-source <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a> project has popularized is <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/tree/master/grammars">generative grammars</a>, which constrain the LLM generation ability to only output according to specified rules. There’s latency overhead with that technique especially if the model is hosted on a discrete GPU, so it will be interesting to watch how that space develops.</p><p>Despite the length of this blog post, there’s still so much more than can be done with schemas: pydantic’s documentation is very extensive! I’ve been working with structured data for LLMs <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-keyword-generation">ever since GPT-2</a> with mixed success since the base models weren’t good enough, but with LLMs now being good enough to maintain a JSON schema extremely well, I think AI text generation techniques will shift, and I’ll keep <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat">simpleaichat</a> up-to-date for it.</p><blockquote><p>You can view the Jupyter Notebooks used to generate all the structured data outputs in <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/chatgpt-structured-data">this GitHub Repository</a>.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://simonwillison.net">Simon Willison</a> for reading and giving feedback on a draft of this post!</p></blockquote></div></div>
