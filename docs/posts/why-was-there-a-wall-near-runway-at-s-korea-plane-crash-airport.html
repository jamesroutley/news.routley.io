    <h1>Why was there a wall near runway at S Korea plane crash airport?</h1>

Captain Ross Aimer, chief executive of Aero Consulting Experts, told Reuters news agency: &#34;Unfortunately, that thing was the reason that everybody got killed, because they literally hit a concrete structure. It shouldn&#39;t have been there.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>Christian Beckert, a Lufthansa pilot based in Munich, called the concrete structure &#34;unusual&#34;, saying: &#34;Normally, on an airport with a runway at the end, you don&#39;t have a wall.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>The concrete structure holds a navigation system that assists aircraft landings - known as a localiser - according to South Korea&#39;s Yonhap News Agency.<!-- --></p><p>At 4m high, it is covered with dirt and was raised to keep the localiser level with the runway to ensure it functions properly, Yonhap reported.<!-- --></p><p>South Korea&#39;s transport ministry has said that other airports in the country and some overseas have the equipment installed with concrete structures. However officials will examine whether it should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Chris Kingswood, a pilot with 48 years&#39; experience who has flown the same type of aircraft involved in the crash, told BBC News: &#34;Obstacles within a certain range and distance of the runway are required to be frangible, which means that if an aircraft strikes them that they do break.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;It does seem unusual that it&#39;s such a rigid thing. The aircraft, from what I understand, was travelling very fast, landed a long way down the runway, so it will have gone a long way past the end of the runway... so where will you draw the line with that? That&#39;s certainly something that will be investigated.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;Aeroplanes are not strong structures - they are, by design, light to make them efficient in flight. They&#39;re not really designed to go high-speed on its belly so any kind of structure could cause the fuselage to break up and then be catastrophic.<!-- --></p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4263/live/bdf1edd0-c6d4-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4263/live/bdf1edd0-c6d4-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4263/live/bdf1edd0-c6d4-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4263/live/bdf1edd0-c6d4-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4263/live/bdf1edd0-c6d4-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4263/live/bdf1edd0-c6d4-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4263/live/bdf1edd0-c6d4-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4263/live/bdf1edd0-c6d4-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.png.webp" alt="A graphic showing a timeline of the plane crash, from when the plane was authorised to land at 09:01 local time after reporting a bird strike, the landing of the plane on the runway at 09:02 and the plane crashing at 09:03 after overshooting the runway
