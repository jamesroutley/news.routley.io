                                  2022-11-14

                                   .io
                                 .io  .io
                                .io  .io .io
                          .io  .io  .io .io .io
                          you see .io everywhere.
                              but where did it come from?

             .io domains are very popular in tech circles.

   i personally think it&#39;s because &#34;io&#34; sounds kind of fun to say at the end of
   words. it&#39;s easy to imagine saying things like KEYBOARDIO, and PRODUCTIO!
   FANTASTIO!

   but also, .io is very startup. it&#39;s very silicon valley. it&#39;s agile. grokio.
   twilio. hot. fast. factorio. graphio. it&#39;s sexy.  wingardium. levio. sah.

              [0]  )

   also - apparently this is important - the letters &#34;i&#34; and &#34;o&#34; together have
   some amount of precedent as input/output in computer lingo.

   maybe seeing those letters together lends subconscious &#34;tech cred.&#34; the
   whole input/output thing never really occured to me tbh.

   but what people may not know is that the .io domain name has an annoying
   history.
   
   a history filled with lies. and deception. and WAR. and a selfish british
   guy
           called paul


                      ~ jes&#39;s .io domain name facts ~

   ~ .io is the official domain of &#34;the british indian ocean territory&#34;

   ~ why .io instead of .tbiot?

     i would have guessed because .tbiot sounds _fucking awful_.
     but it turns out the two-character &#34;io&#34; comes from a country code
     standard called iso-3166[1] who knew?!

   ~ but wait, isn&#39;t the indian ocean more than just the british territories?

     * yes, a lot more. so much more. the indian ocean is really big.

   ~ so what, the domain is bad because it funnels money into bri&#39;ish pockets?

     welllll, not exactly....................................but yes

   ~ british colonialism?

     not exactly. but also yes

   ~ wait wait hold up jes, this isn&#39;t facts about the io domain at all - it
     seems like you&#39;re just asking random questions to yoursel-

     this is my blog and i&#39;ll do what i want god damni-


                   ~~~ a brief history of the io domain ~~~

   1997: the .io domain was delegated by IANA (the internet domain police) to
         paul kane: a &#34;proper&#34; british &#34;bloke&#34; who wanted to &#34;make euros&#34; from
         &#34;the internet&#34;*.

     * paul kane named his company &#34;internet computer bureau&#34; or &#34;ICB&#34;
       if IANA is the internet domain police, maybe paul wanted to be the
       internet domain FBI?

   2014: paul kane claims that &#34;each of the overseas territories has an account and
         the funds are deposited there because obviously the territories have
         expenses that they incur and it‚Äôs offsetting that.&#34;

     * which seems charitable, until:

   2014: the UK government responds with &#34;There is no agreement between the UK
         government and ICB regarding the administration of the .io domain&#34;

     * despite paul&#39;s claims, all .io proceeds likely flowed directly into ICB

   2017: paul sells ICB to afilias for $70 million

     * naturally, this frees up all of paul&#39;s time that he has been spending
       (checks notes) working^Wowning domain names and lying about charity.
          neat

   2019: ethos capital is formed in order to buy the .org TLD

     * they raised a BILLION dollars to buy .org

     * they failed üòÑ

   2020: afilias is acquired by donuts (a company, not a food)

     * donuts owns a bunch of non-traditional domain names, so acquiring .io
       was probably a huge factor in this purchase

   2021: a very sexually frustrated ethos capital buys donuts and afilias

     * and merges them into &#34;identity digital&#34;


                  recap.
     ethos capital was formed
         to raise money
            to buy and profit from the .org domain
     which has historically been not-for-profit
         and had a price ceiling
            but they were stopped ü•≥
     but they got pissed and bought some other domains üò†
         and now, ethos capital owns .io

     neat.


                       üç© donut break üç©

          nom. nom. okay. so far so good.

       nothing too crazy. i mean, money in tech - weird. feels bad.

        but nothing insane.

          welllllll
           llllllllllllll
            llllllllllllll


   ////// TIME WARP //////

   1967: the USA asks the UK to expel the native Chagossians from the chagos
         archipelago

     * the chagos archipelago is - you guessed it - within
       the british indian ocean territory

     * the UK obeys and expels the native Chagossians

   1971: the USA builds a military base on the chagos archipelago

     * since 1971, the chagos archipelago has _only_ been inhabited by
       employees of the US military - everyone else is forbidden.

    \\\\\ END TIME WARP \\\\\


    now things get *strange*:

   2020-2021: .io gets _very_ popular among cryptocurrency enthusiasts

   2021: the united nations tribunal of law and sea (UNTOLAS) claims that the
         UK has no sovereignty over the chagos archipelago

     * this claim would EXTINGUISH the british indian ocean territory, _and_ the
       iso-3166 two-letter country code, _and_ potentially the .io domain

     * the UK disputes and does not recognise the tribunal&#39;s decision, even tho
       they&#39;re not party to the case

   2021: the Chagossian Refugees Group submits complaint against paul kane and
         ethos capital, seeking repatriation of $7m/year for the .io domain 

     * as far as i can tell, this has gone nowhere


     tl;dr~

     .io domains are associated with:
       - cryptocurrency
       - startup culture
       - military occupation
       - native population displacement

     .io domains support:
       - a lucky liar making millions
       - an evil capital firm that attempted a hostile .org takeover

     .io domains may:
       - be extinguished üßØ
