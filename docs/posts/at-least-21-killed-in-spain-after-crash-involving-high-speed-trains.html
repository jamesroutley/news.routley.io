Andalusian emergency services said at least 73 people in total were injured in the collision. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The incident appeared to be &#34;extremely strange&#34;, Puente added, because the train derailed on a straight stretch of track, which had been refurbished in May last year. </p><p>The official cause is not yet known. An investigation is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month.</p><p>Spain&#39;s Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country will endure a &#34;night of deep pain&#34;. </p><p>Iryo, a private rail company that operated the journey from Malaga, said around 300 passengers were on board the train that first derailed, while the other train – operated by Renfe – had around 100 passengers.</p><p>The mayor of Adamuz, Rafael Moreno, was one of the first people on the scene of the accident. He described it as like &#34;a nightmare&#34;.</p><p>In a post on X, the Emergency Agency of Andalucía urged any crash survivors to post on social media that they are alive. </p><p>The twisted wreckage of the train made it difficult to recover survivors and bodies, rescue crews said.</p><p>Cordoba fire chief Francisco Carmona told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE: &#34;We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work.&#34;</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5490/live/430d8b10-f4be-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp" loading="eager" alt="A map of Spain highlighting a section of the country’s high‑speed rail network.
