    <h1>Italy Railways Sabotaged</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block="text"><div><div data-testid="rich-text"><div><p>Police said a track switch was set alight near Pesaro, on the Adriatic coast. Several hours later, police discovered severed electric cables near Bologna, along with a rudimentary explosive device left by a track nearby. </p><p>Bologna&#39;s rail station is a major transport hub, linking cities in the north and south, and east to west lines. </p><p>&#34;These actions of unprecedented seriousness do not in any way tarnish Italy&#39;s image in the world, an image that the Games will make even more compelling and positive,&#34; said Deputy Prime Minister and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini. </p><p>A police spokesperson earlier said that they were investigating the incidents and that no one had claimed responsibility. </p></div></div></div></div></div>
