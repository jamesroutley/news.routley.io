    <h1>File transfers via the parallel port on DOS using LapLink</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<article>
   
  <div><p>I’ve already mentioned the <a href="https://www.parkytowers.me.uk/thin/hp/t5570/">HP t5570e</a> and <a href="https://www.parkytowers.me.uk/thin/hp/t510/">HP t510</a> thin clients a few
times on this site, so they probably don’t require any more introduction.
I will however just stress that one of the nice thing they have going for
them is that they still have serial and parallel ports.</p>
<p>I’ve already put their parallel port to good use, as it allowed me to re-plug
my <a href="https://www.cambus.net/gba-nostalgia-and-the-flash-advance-linker/">Flash Advance Linker</a> and also use the wonderful <a href="https://www.serdaco.com/products/other-audio/opl3lpt/">OPL3LPT</a> device
(an ‘<strong>AdLib</strong>’ parallel port FM synthesizer soundcard).</p>
<p>There is one thing I had always wanted to try, though: the <strong>parallel port</strong>
transfer mode of LapLink. I had used LapLink in the early nineties, but only
with null modem (serial) cables.</p>
<p>I originally planned to solder a cable, but it ended up not being necessary,
as I was able to buy a brand new compatible cable from a seller in Germany.</p>

</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there is very little history available online about the DOS
versions of LapLink, and I’m not sure when its parallel cable was actually
introduced. The “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LapLink_cable">LapLink cable</a>” Wikipedia page mentions 1983, but that
seems strange, as LapLink 2.15 from 1987 does not have any way to configure
the software for using a parallel port cable. LapLink 3.00 from 1989 does.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this article, I decided to use the latest DOS version
available, which appears to be <strong>LapLink 5.00</strong>, released in 1993. It comes
with an improved UI using redefined characters including cute files and folder
icons, along with some subtle animations. I’ve been using the standard color
theme.</p>

</p>
<p>I normally use <strong>THEGRAB.EXE</strong> which was bundled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheDraw">TheDraw</a> ANSI editor
to capture text screens and save them as ANSI files which I can then archive
and convert using <a href="https://www.ansilove.org">Ansilove</a>. However, I ran into some issues and I wanted
to enable the redefined characters anyway. I opted to use the excellent
Screen Thief program from Villa Software, which I had used in the past to
capture some of the screenshots from my <a href="https://cleaner.ansilove.org/coding.html">demoscene productions</a>.</p>
<p>Below is the main file navigation view:</p>

</p>
<p>Notice the small animated arrows along the copy button: the direction changes
to show the destination target. In our case, files will be copied from the
local machine (on the left) to the remote machine (on the right).</p>
<p>LapLink will even warn you if the clocks are out of sync:</p>

<p>Here is a transfer in action:</p>

</p>
<p>The file used is a floppy disk image, and the larger jumps at the end
of the transfer is compression taking place.</p>
<p>Below is a large ongoing transfer and its summary:</p>

</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain, but there is something oddly satisfying in transferring
several hundred megabytes ISO images reliably over the parallel port.</p>
