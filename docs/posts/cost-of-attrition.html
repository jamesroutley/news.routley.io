<p>What if we could visualise the cost of attrition?</p>







<p>Here’s a team. Someone leaves. We hire a replacement.</p>







<p>Really when someone leaves we lose all the relationships they had with the rest of the team as well. The team is a diminished more like 40% than the apparent 20% by their loss. It takes longer to rebuild the team than is apparent. Relationships take time.</p>







<p>It’s worse than that. The team probably wasn’t maximally-connected to start with. And it’s not just the interpersonal relationships that matter but the knowledge of tech and domain. A departure can break teams apart and organisational knowledge needs to be rebuilt.</p>







<p>Your organisation probably has multiple teams. Someone leaving your team reduces its connectedness to the rest of the organisation. Increasing the time to recover even with a swift new hire.</p>







<p>Internal mobility is less of a hit to the team’s connectedness due to pre-existing relationships. It also increases the whole organisations resilience by establishing more inter-team relationships.</p>







<p>Teams following the Isolated-individual model of work… (as opposed to collaborative work like pairing and collective ownership) …are particularly brittle &amp; significantly impacted by staff churn.</p>







<p>How would we think about retention if we could visualise the full impact of someone leaving our team?</p>



<p>Beware looking at teams on a spreadsheet. If you have a hiring rate matching attrition rate it might look like the team health is maintained. It’s probably not. </p>



<p>Tracking tenure by team and average tenure in team can be interesting proxy indicators. Teams can be growing but have dropping tenure.</p>



<p>Bear in mind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong">“All models are wrong, some are useful”</a>. Sometimes teams benefit more from fresh ideas than the value of relationships lost in a change. Sometimes gaining someone who helps everyone else in the team form connections at a faster rate can accelerate the team.</p>
