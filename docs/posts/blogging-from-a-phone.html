          <p>Hello World!</p>

<p>It’s been a while since I wrote something for the blog. In my current routine, I’ve found it hard to make time to sit in front of a machine after work, and have enough contiguous time that I can draft and write anything meaningful. I do have time to doom scroll though, and my urge to keep writing has been in the twilight zone of ‘I still want to write’, and ‘I’ll do it tomorrow’.</p>

<p>It turns out that a fair bit of progress has been made in recent times, and looking outside the traditional app stores gives me some hope. While browsing around on FDroid, I found <a href="https://jekyllex.xyz/">JekyllEx</a>, an app that bundles in an entire Ruby environment. This allows us to locally run Jekyll, and preview changes. This is great. I can now type small bits while I’m on the phone, and over a few 5-10 minute sessions, put in the work on a full post.</p>

<p>My first (successful) attempt at this has been to clone the repo within the JekyllEx app, creating a new file, and then opening that file up in <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.blacksquircle.ui/">Squircle CE</a>, which makes it slightly easier to write in Markdown. I can then spin up the Jekyll process back in the main app, do my proof reading, and push the post back up as a git commit. These all depend on personal access tokens, which is probably fine for my current usage. I’ll keep generating short lived tokens till I build more trust in this process.</p>

<p>If you’re reading this post on my blog, it’s proof that this works!</p>
