    <h1>Week 1 at Recurse Center</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
<p>Twice this year, I&#39;ve had the good fortune to find myself in spaces filled with people aligned to a common purpose: earlier this year at <a href="https://www.haystack-mtn.org/">Haystack Mountain Schoool of Craft</a>, and now at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>. These environments foster a regime of expansion and change, and have the power to focus, broaden, and alter one&#39;s sense of purpose. These environments can be quite intense to adjust and recalibrate to, as they involve large changes to the core substrates and infrastructures that compose of one&#39;s daily existence: time, geography, architecture, and community. Much of this is self-evident and not particularly profound to point out, but its lived experience can most immediately be felt in the constellation of affective states that manifest throughout the transition: overhwelm, nervous excitement, disorientation, decision paralysis, fight-or-flight, hyperactivity, dissociation.</p>
<p>This summer, at Haystack, in addition to learning the <a href="https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd">workflows and processes of ceramic 3D printing</a>, I went paddleboarding for the very first time. On my initial attempts to stand up and paddle about, I was quickly tossed into the water. The Haystack campus is built on a granite island off the Maine coast, and faces out directly to the ocean. After falling a couple times into the rocking waves, I decided to paddle sitting down instead for a while, but before finally returning to shore, I decided to just stand on the board for a bit, without paddling. I then sat back down again and rowed back to shore. The next day, and each subsequent day on the beach, I found myself immediately able to paddleboard standing up without any further issue. The last time I watched my body in the process of learning was when I began taking ceramics classes in 2019, and it struck me, more or less for the first time, how quickly, and quietly, embodied intelligence is set into motion.</p>
<p>I think of acclimating to environments like Recurse in a similar way, that the transition still passes through the body, even for something as heady as Recurse&#39;s guiding mission to enable its participants to become radically better programmers over the duration of the residency.</p>
<p>〜〜〜</p>
<p>So, it&#39;s been a lot of just that, riding the waves through varying affective states, while also slowly refining my sense of purpose here. I&#39;ve been working out a set of priorities and goals, in order to make more tangible that sense of purpose, which I&#39;ll share below. It&#39;s a little sobering that after having just wrapped the first week of my six-week residency here, I&#39;m already nearly a quarter of the way through.</p>
<p>So far, I&#39;ve committed to going through some amount of <a href="https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html">Andrej Karpathy&#39;s introduction to building neural networks from scratch</a> and Russell Webb&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/Russ741/karpathy-nn-z2h">accompanying worksheets</a>, though I&#39;m also likely going to switch to or ping-pong between that series and the <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook">Fast.ai series</a>.</p>
<h4>Guiding principles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Stay open-ended and cultivate sensitivity, paying attention to what drives my own interests in tech, and see what it is that drives other programmers to similar or divergent interests</li>
<li>Think of the residency as more of an onboarding, not an end to itself</li>
<li>Embrace being process-oriented, balanced against being results-driven (but not necessarily working backwards from a predetermined outcome)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Goals</h4>
<ul>
<li>Learn a new programming language (Python)</li>
<li>Learn the fundamentals of ML</li>
<li>Get feedback on previous/existing projects, like <a href="https://frogchor.us">Frog Chorus</a></li>
<li>Finish and share at least one small project</li>
<li>Understand current employment landscape / opportunities</li>
<li>Give focus to both writing code and text (like this entry)</li>
</ul>
