<p>At its launch in 1982, the  80286 was most certainly a leap ahead of the 8086 (and 8088). It remedied several shortcomings of its forebears, such as the 640 kilobyte memory limit and introduced a new &#34;protected mode&#34; where each program could run in its own distinct memory space, thus eliminating the potential for corruption when multitasking. Both Windows/286 and OS/2 operating systems made use of the 286&#39;s new mode, but for most of us who remained with DOS which ran in &#34;real mode&#34;, the key benefits of the 286 were never realised.</p>
<p>The challenge here was the need for PC microprocessors to always remain 100% backward-compatible with their forebears so existing software would continue to run without problems. This, coupled with some inherent design limitations in DOS and the lack of adoption of fancy new windowed environments in the early 80s sadly mooted much of what Intel had put into the 286 architecture.</p>
        <p>Introduced with a 6 MHz clock speed in the <a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/computers/IBM%20PC-AT%20%285170%29/ibm5170.php">IBM 5170</a>, it scored a MIPS (Millions of Instructions Per Second) rating of 1.2. Soon after, 8 and 10 MHz versions were also available, but the fastest version at launch was the 12.5 MHz one, coming in at a blistering 2.66 MIPS. When compared with  the 8086, it was about three times as fast clock for clock.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/images/intel_N80286.jpg" width="400"/></p>
        <p>It&#39;s still a little surprising to think that my friends and I were running this sort of technology a decade after their initial release! I put this down to two things:</p>
        <p>1) Brand new microprocessor technology was always very expensive when it first came out. The 80286 microprocessor alone was about $2,000 US dollars (£1,100) at launch. Skip forward 4 years and a typical PC builder would be able to source a slow 80286-8 at about £120 for the CPU. This would mean a full system build around that CPU would start at around £1,600 retail in 1986.</p>

<h3>The Harris/Intersil 25 MHz</h3>
<p>Harris Semiconductor, along with AMD, Fujitsu, Siemens and several other companies with chip fabrication facilities in the U.S. had a longstanding contract with Intel to manufacture Intel&#39;s microprocessors. When Intel shifted their focus to their new 80386, they deliberately cut ties with their second source partners, which meant only Intel-branded (and Intel-fabricated) 386 chips would be available to the PC market.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/images/mobos/lm-103S-286_ht12a/amd286_quote.png" width="300"/>Without a new 386 to manufacture, Intel&#39;s partners were stuck with the 16-bit 80286 platform. So what did they do? They created 286s that ran at ever higher clock speeds!</p>
<p>The fastest <a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/cpus.php#i80286">80286</a> CPU produced was the 25 MHz variant manufactured by Harris, who were later acquired by Intersil. This arrived in <a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/1989.php">1989</a>, seven years after the first Intel 80286 hit the market and four years after they had launched the 386. Today, not only are these Harris CPUs quite rare, but finding a suitable motherboard on which to run one at that speed is an even bigger challenge.</p><p><a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/images/amd286_news_dec1988.png"><img src="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/images/amd286_news_dec1988.png" width="500"/></a></p>

<p>286 motherboards tended to max out at 20 MHz with the main limiting factors being the <a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/chipsets.php">chipset&#39;s</a> ability to run at higher frequencies, and the motherboard design. Over its 10-years-or-so lifetime, the 286 was coupled with numerous chipsets created by <a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/Manufacturers/candt.php">Chips &amp; Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/Manufacturers/ti.php">Texas Instruments</a>, <a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/Manufacturers/vlsi.php">VLSI</a>, <a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/Manufacturers/headland.php">Headland</a> and others. While all of these allowed for a usable 286 PC, they varied in reliability and performance, though it would be difficult to detect any real differences between them on an average 286 running up to 16 MHz.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/images/harris_80286-25.jpg" width="250"/>Oh, and you might have heard of the &#34;<a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/images/PC-Mag-1988-09-27_0074.jpg">Chang Modification</a>&#34; from late 1988 when a Taiwan-based company called Tienwei Computers declared they had produced a 40 MHz 80286 motherboard. The media saw it running benchmarks, and it all looked pretty legitimate - the world was astounded. Soon after they discovered it was all smoke and mirrors - he &#34;gamed&#34; the computer clock in such a way that the <em>Landmark Speed Test </em>gauge calculated performance incorrectly, making a system look about four times more powerful than it really was. This was achieved by making the DOS timer run slower, so effectively what is measured as &#34;10 seconds&#34; by a benchmark program would in reality take 20 seconds if you halve the DOS timer frequency. </p>
<h3>The Faster 80286 Chipsets</h3>
<p>Fortunately for us today, we can look back and see that several reliable chipsets were produced that support running an 80286 processor at 20 to 25 MHz while decoupling the AT (ISA) bus so that it could run at the requisite 8 or 10 MHz. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Headland HT12/A (HT12 Rev.A) - 20 MHz limit and 4 MB RAM limit</li>
  <li>VLSI VL82C311L - designed for up to 25 MHz. Full 16 MB RAM support</li>
  <li>VLSI VL82C201 - designed for up to 20 MHz, but can reach 27.5 MHz</li>
  <li>Suntac ST62C251 - designed for up to 20 MHz</li>
  <li>UMC UM82C210 - designed for up to 20 MHz. Up to 8 MB RAM supported</li>
  <li>SA1 - supposedly good for 20 MHz, 16 MB RAM support</li>
  </ul>
<p>If you know of other fast 286-compatible chipsets, please let me know!</p>

<p>Before I get into the various 286 chipsets, as a set of baseline synthetic performance benchmarks I want to post a few  results from 386 systems - do bear in mind this  is not super-scientific; the findings of this article may not be reproducible elsewhere, and do not necessarily reflect real-world performance:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td><strong>Norton SI 6.0<br/>
    </strong>Intel 80386DX-20, old  C&amp;T CS8230 386 chipset, 1 WS = 9.7</td>
    <td><strong>Landmark 6.0</strong> </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3>Headland HT12/A</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/media/headland/ht12/ht12a.jpg" width="135"/>This chipset is possibly the most ubiquitous of the fast chipsets I am visiting today. I have seen numerous motherboard designs over the years that use the <a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/Manufacturers/headland.php">Headland</a> HT12/A, and a plethora of Taiwan-based motherboard manufacturers in the early 90s made use of the faster speeds this could support towards the end of the 286s useful life.</p>
<p>With the use of the <a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/drivers/ht12mm.zip.zip">HT12MM.SYS</a> driver, you can get XMS and EMS memory in DOS. Alternatively, to get 64 KB of UMBs in which to load drivers, use <a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/drivers/tlb_v252.zip">“The Last Byte” memory manager</a> by adding this to your CONFIG.SYS:</p>
<pre>DEVICE=C:\TLBMM\LASTBYTE.SYS Physical=HT12,NOEMS,OVERRIDE<br/>
</pre>
<p>You can then use the <strong>hightsr</strong> utility to load your drivers high. I have a more complete article <a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/ht12_xms_ems.php">here</a> on setting up XMS and EMS for this chipset.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the HT12 (not HT12/A) chipset officially supports CPUs up to 16 MHz, and the HT12/<strong>A</strong> takes it one step further to 20 MHz. Some folks have had success by replacing their motherboard&#39;s 40 MHz crystal oscillator with a 50 MHz one, which pushes the chipset to run  at 25 MHz*. </p>
<p>*<em>Incidentally, nearly all 286 motherboards operate in a CLK/2 fashion, so the crystal oscillator directly drives the microprocessor at half its frequency. In other words, 16 MHz motherboards will have a 32 MHz crystal for the CPU and 20 MHz motherboards will have a 40 MHz crystal.</em></p>
<p>Bear in mind that upgrading the oscillator may cause lock-ups, and will often result in higher temperatures being felt on the top of the CPU, chipset, RAM, and other supporting chips. It you are looking to overclock your 286 motherboard, you may want to reduce it from a 50 MHz crystal to something slightly slower like a 48 MHz or 44 MHz one if you are seeing problems. Also, when running anything over 20 MHz, you will likely need to add 1 or more wait states to get it to <a href="https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/pc_bios.php">POST</a> at all, or to run stable. Also  use the fastest 60ns RAM from a good quality manufacturer if you can find some as this is more likely to cope with zero wait states.</p>
<p>Boards that are known to use the HT12 and HT12/A chipsets are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>G2-12HS-16 / Quadtel HT12</li>
  <li>Eurosoft HT12</li>
  <li>Octek Fox II (GW/286)</li>
  <li>Commodore 286/16</li>
  <li>LM-103</li>
  <li>Advantech Industrial PC PCA-6126 (286 CPU card w/ ROM disk)</li>
</ul>
<p>An excellent article over at TargetEarth.net introduces us to the <a href="https://www.target-earth.net/wiki/doku.php?id=blog:286_shootout_eurosoft-ht12&amp;rev=1613598189">Eurosoft HT12</a>. This motherboard uses the HT12/A along with its own BIOS (Eurosoft themselves were an early BIOS firmware company).</p>
<p>TargetEarth&#39;s benchmark results at the standard 16 MHz were:</p><p>
