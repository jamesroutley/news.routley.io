    <h1>New Linux glibc flaw lets attackers get root on major distros</h1>

<p>​Unprivileged attackers can get root access on multiple major Linux distributions in default configurations by exploiting a newly disclosed local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability in the GNU C Library (glibc).</p>
<p>Tracked as <a href="https://www.qualys.com/2024/01/30/cve-2023-6246/syslog.txt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2023-6246</a>, this security flaw was found in glibc&#39;s __vsyslog_internal() function, called by the widely-used syslog and vsyslog functions for writing messages to the system message logger.</p>
<p>The bug is due to a <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">heap-based buffer overflow weakness</a> accidentally introduced in glibc 2.37 in August 2022 and later backported to glibc 2.36 when addressing a less severe vulnerability tracked as CVE-2022-39046.</p>
<p>&#34;The buffer overflow issue poses a significant threat as it could allow local privilege escalation, enabling an unprivileged user to gain full root access through crafted inputs to applications that employ these logging functions,&#34; Qualys security researchers said.</p>
<p>&#34;Although the vulnerability requires specific conditions to be exploited (such as an unusually long argv[0] or openlog() ident argument), its impact is significant due to the widespread use of the affected library.&#34;</p>
<h2>Impacts Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora systems</h2>
<p>While testing their findings, Qualys confirmed that Debian 12 and 13, Ubuntu 23.04 and 23.10, and Fedora 37 to 39 were all vulnerable to CVE-2023-6246 exploits, allowing any unprivileged user to escalate privileges to full root access on default installations.</p>
<p>Although their tests were limited to a handful of distros, the researchers added that &#34;other distributions are probably also exploitable.&#34;</p>
<p>While analyzing glibc for other potential security issues, the researchers also found three other vulnerabilities, two of them—harder to exploit—in the __vsyslog_internal() function (CVE-2023-6779 and CVE-2023-6780) and a third one (a <a href="https://www.qualys.com/2024/01/30/qsort.txt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">memory corruption issue</a> still waiting for a CVEID) in glibc&#39;s qsort () function.</p>
<p>&#34;The recent discovery of these vulnerabilities is not just a technical concern but a matter of widespread security implications,&#34; <a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2024/01/30/qualys-tru-discovers-important-vulnerabilities-in-gnu-c-librarys-syslog" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Saeed Abbasi, Product Manager at Qualys&#39; Threat Research Unit.</p>
<p>&#34;These flaws highlight the critical need for strict security measures in software development, especially for core libraries widely used across many systems and applications.&#34;</p>
<h2>Other Linux root escalation flaws found by Qualys</h2>
<p>Over the past few years, researchers at Qualys have found several other Linux security vulnerabilities that can let attackers gain complete control over unpatched Linux systems, even in default configurations.</p>
<p>Vulnerabilities they discovered include a flaw in glibc&#39;s ld.so dynamic loader (<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-looney-tunables-linux-bug-gives-root-on-major-distros/" target="_blank">Looney Tunables</a>), one in Polkit&#39;s pkexec component (<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/linux-system-service-bug-gives-root-on-all-major-distros-exploit-released/" target="_blank">dubbed PwnKit</a>), another in the Kernel&#39;s filesystem layer (<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-linux-kernel-bug-lets-you-get-root-on-most-modern-distros/" target="_blank">dubbed Sequoia</a>), and in the Sudo Unix program (aka <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-linux-sudo-flaw-lets-local-users-gain-root-privileges/" target="_blank">Baron Samedit</a>).</p>
<p>Days after the Looney Tunables flaw (<a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-4911" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2023-4911</a>) was disclosed, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits were <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/exploits-released-for-linux-flaw-giving-root-on-major-distros/" target="_blank">published online</a>, and threat actors <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploit-looney-tunables-linux-bug-steal-cloud-creds/" target="_blank">started exploiting it</a> one month later to steal cloud service provider (CSP) credentials in Kinsing malware attacks.</p>
<p>The Kinsing gang is known for deploying cryptocurrency mining malware on compromised cloud-based systems, including Kubernetes, Docker APIs, Redis, and Jenkins servers.</p>
<p>CISA later <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-orders-federal-agencies-to-patch-looney-tunables-linux-bug/" target="_blank">ordered U.S. federal agencies</a> to secure their Linux systems against CVE-2023-4911 attacks after adding it to its catalog of actively exploited bugs and tagging it as posing &#34;significant risks to the federal enterprise.&#34;</p>
