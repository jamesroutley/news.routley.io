<em>This is a true story. This actually happened.</em></p>
<p>
<em>Everything in this essay exists.</em></p>

<p>
The United States is conspicuous.</p>
<p>
Advertisements straddle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System">48,756 miles</a> of asphalt like 60-foot weeds. US billboards are windows into America’s soul: strip clubs, bible verses, casinos, lawyers, and fast food.</p>
<p>
And if billboards are windows, gas stations are doors. Gas stations compress car culture and consumerism into a corporate copy/paste container. Pump your SUV full of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_ethanol">corn oil</a> while you purchase cigarettes, beer, and junk food.</p>
<p>
There’s a giant ice cream sundae building between Las Vegas and Los Angeles. The ice cream sundae conceals a giant water tank at “California’s largest gas station”. Welcome to <a href="https://eddieworld.com">Eddie World</a>.</p>
<p>
I wasn’t surprised to find tiny digital billboards adorning each urinal. Of course somebody is monetizing my 40-second piss break.</p>
<p>
On the screen, a cartoon penguin skied against a barrier on the left. What? 0 points? Then it hit me. It wasn’t an advertisement – it was a video game! And it was controlled by my “joystick”!</p>
<p>
I earned 15 points. A leaderboard appeared with 10 names like “William” and “Nathan” on it. For obvious reasons, I declined to enter my name on the touchscreen.</p>
<p>
I fear the implementation details. <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5673">Cameras are ~$15</a> and <a href="https://opencv.org">computer-vision is free</a>. Let’s pray they’re not connected to Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>
For better or worse, we live in the future.</p>
