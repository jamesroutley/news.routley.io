It wants to know why. </p></div></div></ps-promo> </div><p> No commercially available motor vehicle today can completely drive itself, the agency said. Tesla’s Autopilot feature is classified as “Level 2” vehicle autonomy, which means the vehicle can control steering and acceleration, but a human in the driver’s seat can take control at any time.</p><p>“Whether a [Level 2] automated driving system is engaged or not, every available vehicle requires the human driver to be in control at all times, and all state laws hold the human driver responsible for the operation of their vehicles,” a NHTSA spokesperson said. “Certain advanced driving assistance features can promote safety by helping drivers avoid crashes and mitigate the severity of crashes that occur, but as with all technologies and equipment on motor vehicles, drivers must use them correctly and responsibly.”</p><p>The outcome of the case could set a precedent for an industry idling at the corner of cutting-edge technology and basic human error. </p><p>Bryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina and an  expert in laws related to automated motor vehicles, said that while companies routinely face civil liability, they “rarely face criminal liability for design decisions.”</p><p>Yet Smith takes issue with the assertion that drivers — and only drivers — are liable at or below Level 2 automation. For example, if the airbag of a well-maintained car were to suddenly explode and cause a crash, the driver would not be culpable, he said.</p><p>“Conversely, if an automaker sells a dangerous car, they might be civilly liable. And, at least in theory, they might face criminal liability. This, however, is a rare prospect,” he said, noting that when the state of Indiana prosecuted Ford over a crash involving its Pinto model more than four decades ago, the company was acquitted.</p><p>A representative for Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department, could not be reached for comment.</p><div data-align-center="" data-click="enhancement"> <ps-promo data-module-id="0000017e-6f94-d0b2-a17e-ffd6500c0007" data-content-type="article" data-show-img="" data-click="promoSmall"><div><div data-click="media"><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-12-31/fatal-tesla-crash-nhtsa-gardena-los-angeles" aria-label="Fatal Tesla crash in Gardena being investigated by NHTSA"><picture>   <source type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f18f7d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/110x73!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2Fb0%2F203508744256af45765358f09a50%2Fapphoto-tesla-crash.JPG 110w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fe7b393/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/180x120!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2Fb0%2F203508744256af45765358f09a50%2Fapphoto-tesla-crash.JPG 180w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cb53404/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2Fb0%2F203508744256af45765358f09a50%2Fapphoto-tesla-crash.JPG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/953e69b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2Fb0%2F203508744256af45765358f09a50%2Fapphoto-tesla-crash.JPG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ad68291/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2Fb0%2F203508744256af45765358f09a50%2Fapphoto-tesla-crash.JPG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1a35fff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/840x560!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2Fb0%2F203508744256af45765358f09a50%2Fapphoto-tesla-crash.JPG 840w" data-lazy-load="true"/>    <img alt="FILE - This Friday, Sept. 30, 2016, file photo shows the logo of the Tesla Model S on display at the Paris Auto Show in Paris.
