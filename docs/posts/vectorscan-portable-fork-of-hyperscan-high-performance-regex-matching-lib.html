    <h1>Vectorscan – portable fork of hyperscan – high-performance regex matching lib</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
          <article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">A fork of Intel&#39;s Hyperscan, modified to run on more platforms. Currently ARM NEON/ASIMD
is 100% functional, and Power VSX are in development. ARM SVE2 will be implemented when
harwdare becomes accessible to the developers. More platforms will follow in the future,
on demand/request.</p>
<p dir="auto">Vectorscan will follow Intel&#39;s API and internal algorithms where possible, but will not
hesitate to make code changes where it is thought of giving better performance or better
portability. In addition, the code will be gradually simplified and made more uniform and
all architecture specific -currently Intel- #ifdefs will be removed and abstracted away.</p>

<p dir="auto">Originally, the ARM porting was supposed to be merged into Intel&#39;s own Hyperscan, and 2
Pull Requests had been made to the project for this reason (<a href="https://github.com/intel/hyperscan/pull/272">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/intel/hyperscan/pull/287">2</a>). Unfortunately, the
PRs were rejected for now and the forseeable future, thus we have created Vectorscan for
our own multi-architectural and opensource collaborative needs.</p>

<p dir="auto">Hyperscan is a high-performance multiple regex matching library. It follows the
regular expression syntax of the commonly-used libpcre library, but is a
standalone library with its own C API.</p>
<p dir="auto">Hyperscan uses hybrid automata techniques to allow simultaneous matching of
large numbers (up to tens of thousands) of regular expressions and for the
matching of regular expressions across streams of data.</p>
<p dir="auto">Vectorscan is typically used in a DPI library stack, just like Hyperscan.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>To cross compile for AArch64, first adjust the variables set in cmake/setenv-arm64-cross.sh.
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>export CROSS=&lt;arm-cross-compiler-dir&gt;/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-</code></li>
<li><code>export CROSS_SYS=&lt;arm-cross-compiler-system-dir&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>export BOOST_PATH=&lt;boost-source-dir&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set the environment variables:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>source cmake/setenv-arm64-cross.sh</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configure Vectorscan:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>mkdir &lt;build-dir-name&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>cd &lt;build-dir&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>cmake -DCROSS_COMPILE_AARCH64=1 &lt;hyperscan-source-dir&gt; -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=&lt;hyperscan-source-dir&gt;/cmake/arm64-cross.cmake</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build Vectorscan:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>make -jT</code> where T is the number of threads used to compile.</li>
<li><code>cmake --build . -- -j T</code> can also be used instead of make.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">The following cmake variables can be set in order to target Arm&#39;s Scalable
Vector Extension. They are listed in ascending order of strength, with cmake
detecting whether the feature is available in the compiler and falling back to
a weaker version if not. Only one of these variables needs to be set as weaker
variables will be implied as set.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>BUILD_SVE</code></li>
<li><code>BUILD_SVE2</code></li>
<li><code>BUILD_SVE2_BITPERM</code></li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Information on building the Hyperscan library and using its API is available in
the <a href="http://intel.github.io/hyperscan/dev-reference/" rel="nofollow">Developer Reference Guide</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Vectorscan, like Hyperscan is licensed under the BSD License. See the LICENSE file in the
project repository.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>master</code> branch on Github will always contain the most recent release of
Hyperscan. Each version released to <code>master</code> goes through QA and testing before
it is released; if you&#39;re a user, rather than a developer, this is the version
you should be using.</p>
<p dir="auto">Further development towards the next release takes place on the <code>develop</code>
branch.</p>
