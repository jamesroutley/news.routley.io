    <h1>Nothing: Simply Do Nothing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="Nothing Logo" height="30" src="https://usenothing.com/logo.svg" width="30"/></p><p>Greetings, Stranger.</p><p>Ease your mind.</p><p>You&#39;ve been idle for <span>000</span> second<!-- -->s<!-- -->.</p></div><div><p>Nothing—a timer that tracks your intentional choice to do... nothing. No goals to chase, no notifications clamoring for your attention, no pressure to fill the silence with productivity. It simply exists, quietly counting each second you allow to pass. This is a space where inactivity is the point—a digital oasis amidst the chaos of endless tasks and to-dos.</p><p>Yet the essence of Nothing isn&#39;t about fixating on your screen, though you&#39;re welcome to if you wish. It&#39;s about setting aside your phone or computer, taking a step back from the relentless grind, and reconnecting with the world around you. Nothing is more a concept than an app—a quiet reflection rather than a tool to be used. It stands as a gentle rebellion against the incessant noise of modern life, which demands constant action.</p><p>Stay as long as you like, watch the seconds tick away, or let your gaze wander elsewhere. There&#39;s no reward for lingering, just the peculiar pleasure of simply being. Sometimes, the most profound act is to pause, breathe, and do nothing at all—a reminder that it&#39;s perfectly acceptable to embrace stillness and just... be.</p><p><span>The pointless statistics:</span>Your Highest: <span>000</span> second<!-- -->s<!-- --> — Total: <span>000</span> <!-- -->second<!-- -->s<!-- -->.</p><p>Created by<!-- --> <a href="https://x.com/remvze" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Maze</a>.<!-- --> </p></div></div>
