    <h1>Apple Buys DarwinAI Ahead of Major Generative AI Updates Coming in iOS 18</h1>

DarwinAI created AI technology for inspecting components during the manufacturing process, and it also had a focus on making smaller and more efficient AI systems.</p>

<p>Apple confirmed the acquisition with the statement that it typically gives when questioned about purchases. &#34;Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time&#34; but does not discuss its purpose or plans.</p>
<p>In an effort to catch up with Microsoft, Google, and others in the AI market, Apple is working hard to build artificial intelligence features for its next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and macOS 15 operating systems.</p>
<p>If Apple wants to be able to rival Microsoft&#39;s Bing, OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT, and other generative AI offerings, it will need to integrate generative AI into a range of products. Apple is testing large language models, and AI features are said to be coming to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, Shortcuts, Messages, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Apple is aiming to have AI features run on-device for privacy reasons, and DarwinAI&#39;s efforts to make smaller AI systems could be of use to further that endeavor.</p>
<p>Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/tim-cook-apple-generative-ai-break-new-ground/">has promised</a> that Apple will &#34;break new ground&#34; in generative AI in 2024. &#34;We believe it will unlock transformative opportunities for our users,&#34; said Cook.</p>
