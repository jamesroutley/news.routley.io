The linux-kernel mailing list famously gets an enormous amount of email on a
daily basis; the volume is so high that various email providers try to
rate-limit it, which can lead to huge backlogs on the sending 
side and, of course, delayed mail.  Part of the reason there is so much
traffic is that nearly every patch gets copied to the mailing list, even
when it may be unnecessary to do so.  A proposed change
would start shunting some of that patch email aside and, as might be
guessed, has both supporters and detractors,  but the discussion does
highlight some of the
different ways the mailing list is used by kernel developers.
</p>

<p>
In a <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/20231106-venomous-raccoon-of-wealth-acc57c@nitro/">post</a>
that was <i>not</i> sent to linux-kernel, but to the Kernel Summit
discussion list (ksummit-discuss) and the kernel.org users
mailing list, Konstantin Ryabitsev described the problems he sees with
the current status of the list.  It has nearly 3000 subscribers and is
copied on nearly every patch because of a wildcard entry at the end of the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/linux/MAINTAINERS"><tt>MAINTAINERS</tt>
file</a>; that, in turn, leads to around 3.1 million messages being
delivered to inboxes daily based on the roughly 33,000 monthly posts to the
list.  But that does not work well when delivering
to a whole bunch of Gmail addresses:
</p><blockquote>
due to gmail&#39;s quota policies, this generally results in anywhere from 50K to
  200K messages stuck in the queue all trying to deliver to gmail and being
  deferred with &#34;this account is receiving too much mail&#34;
</blockquote>


<p>
His suggested solution is to reroute the wildcard entry so that patches go
to the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-patches/">patches@lists.linux.dev</a>
mailing list rather than linux-kernel.  That will (eventually) reduce the
volume on the list, thus &#34;<q>unclog the outgoing queues and speed up mail
delivery for everyone</q>&#34;.  Currently, the
<tt>get_maintainer.pl</tt> tool, which is often used with other tools like
&#34;<tt>git send-email</tt>&#34;, will pick up the entry for &#34;THE REST&#34; at
the end of <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt>; the entry says to send everything to
linux-kernel.  The linux-patches list is available, for those who want it,
via the <a href="https://people.kernel.org/monsieuricon/lore-lei-part-1-getting-started">lei
tool</a> or by anonymous POP3 for those who want to receive the
patches that way—at Gmail, for instance.  But direct subscriptions to
linux-patches will be vetted 
so that the mechanism for overwhelming email providers with patches does
not recur.  
</p>

<p>
Joe Perches, who maintains <tt>get_maintainer.pl</tt> and other development
tools, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/2ee1a77665e770846a5868798393b8361d6d2033.camel@perches.com/">called</a>
it an &#34;<q>excellent idea</q>&#34;; Borislav Petkov <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/20231106155252.GBZUkL1IKeITpgzfZC@fat_crate.local/">said</a>
that CCing patches to linux-kernel was meant for archiving purposes, so a
separate list should work just fine for that instead.  Others, though,
disagreed with 
one of 
the downsides of the current situation that Ryabitsev had listed: &#34;<q>due
to the sheer volume of 
messages, LKML is generally seen as useless for 
  holding any actual discussions</q>&#34;.
</p>

<p>
Eric W. Biederman <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/87r0l2yi7v.fsf@email.froward.int.ebiederm.org/">said</a>
that he at least skims linux-kernel with some frequency; Christoph
Hellwig <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/ZUkcyCb5DEVEDkKj@infradead.org/">agreed</a>,
adding that he does start discussions on that list as well.  Meanwhile, Willy
Tarreau <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/20231107040433.GA23816@1wt.eu/">suggested</a>
that it is a good way to keep abreast of kernel developments:
</p><blockquote>
This way
every day I can have a quick glance at all subjects there, that&#39;s how I
discover new topics, patch series, discussions etc. I think that a non
negligible number of LKML subscribers are there for this exact reason.
</blockquote>


<p>
He said that he would personally miss the patches that got moved to the
other list, but he also questioned how much improvement the change would
actually bring.  Others also wondered about how much traffic would be
reduced; Pavel Machek <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/ZUluOoDjp%2FawmXtF@duo.ucw.cz/">thought</a> that the
number of patches picked up by the wildcard was fairly low.  Paolo Bonzini <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/34eda1fe-0e14-4f12-b472-d152eadb7b88@redhat.com/">said</a>
that it might be the configuration of <tt>git send-email</tt> that was
actually causing the patches to be posted to linux-kernel, which means
local changes would be needed to alter it; other
developers did not think that was a common configuration, however.  Laurent
Pinchart <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/20231107101513.GB27932@pendragon.ideasonboard.com/">pointed
out</a> that the &#34;<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html">submitting
patches</a>&#34; document is rather ambiguous about sending patches to
linux-kernel:
</p><blockquote>
<blockquote>
  linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org should be used by default for all
  patches, but the volume on that list has caused a number of developers
  to tune it out.  Please do not spam unrelated lists and unrelated
  people, though.
</blockquote>
This should be updated, even if for the only reason that the text is
quite confusing (in my opinion at least, I&#39;m not sure if it means LKML
should be used for all patches, or shouldn&#39;t).
</blockquote>


<p>
He also noted that, unlike some of the other responders, he has completely
tuned out linux-kernel since the volume of email &#34;<q>drowns the useful
information in noise for me</q>&#34;.  Greg Kroah-Hartman <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/2023110701-overstuff-tidiness-10c2@gregkh/">said</a>
that switching the tools to do the right thing will help; for example,
the linux-usb mailing list is specified as where patches for the USB subsystem
should go, 
but <tt>get_maintainer.pl</tt> still also lists linux-kernel for USB
patches.  The change 
suggested by Ryabitsev would avoid doing that, &#34;<q>which is a good thing and
should cut down on the overall size over time</q>&#34;. 
</p>

<p>
If that change is made, though, Julia Lawall <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/20231107-skilled-calculating-frigatebird-8db1bb@nitro/">wondered</a>
how she would be able to review &#34;<q>the discussion that led up to a
commit</q>&#34;; currently, looking at linux-kernel is &#34;<q>the obvious place to
go for that</q>&#34;. Dan Carpenter <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/202ebed9-465e-43d1-bd3a-417ad4a5e425@kadam.mountain/">suggested</a>
&#34;<q>lore.kernel.org and b4 and lei</q>&#34;, while  Pratyush Yadav <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/mafs0ttpxg0is.fsf_-_@kernel.org/">provided</a> a
detailed description of how to use those tools for tracking down a
discussion. That procedure will find patches and discussions that
occurred before he subscribed, which makes it &#34;<q>more powerful and
complete than subscribing to 
mailing lists</q>&#34;. 
Ryabitsev <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/20231107-skilled-calculating-frigatebird-8db1bb@nitro/">pointed
out</a> that all of the lists that are archived at <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/">lore.kernel.org</a> are actually indexed
together, so that searches using <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/">lore.kernel.org/all</a> will find
message IDs or subjects in all of the kernel lists—including linux-patches.
</p>

<p>
There may well be a discussion about the idea in the Kernel Summit
track at the upcoming <a href="https://lpc.events/">Linux Plumbers
Conference</a>, or perhaps the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/linux-kernel-maintainer-summit/">Maintainer
Summit</a> the following day.  That is presumably one reason that Ryabitsev
posted to ksummit-discuss, though Carpenter <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/a53bcecb-3230-4ad3-8e62-29f4395a26a0@kadam.mountain/">noted</a>
that it makes a better forum for general topics than linux-kernel these days.
</p>

<p>
There are probably as many different kernel-development styles as there are
kernel developers—a number that grows with each release—so finding common
ground between them all is difficult, if not outright impossible.  The
problems with mail delivery these days are real, sadly, and it is most
certainly not only Gmail that causes those kinds of woes.  Given that,
which only seems to get worse over time, some kind of mailing-list
fix is going to be needed; Ryabitsev&#39;s plan seems a reasonable approach
that may well help.  Beyond that, those who are using the large, free email
providers 
may want to consider voluntarily switching their linux-kernel subscription
elsewhere in order to improve the service and reliability of the mailing
list for everyone else.
