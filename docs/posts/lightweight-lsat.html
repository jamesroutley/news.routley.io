<p><em>The lightweight LSAT</em> is a simple, proven, and completely free guide to the Law School Admissions Test.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-guide-for">Who is this guide for?</h2>
<p><em>The lightweight LSAT</em> is designed for students who are frustrated with their current way of approaching the LSAT.
It doesn&#39;t assume you have any knowledge of the LSAT, but it will be most useful for someone who already has some experience studying.</p>
<p>Additionally, <em>the lightweight LSAT</em> is written for students who are ambitious, aiming for a score over 165.
That said, the strategies I suggest here can help anyone, because achieving a top score is a matter of mastering fundamental skills that everyone can learn.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-the-lsat-different-than-other-tests">How is the LSAT different than other tests?</h2>
<p>Most exams <strong>test your knowledge</strong>.
But the LSAT <strong>tests your skills</strong>.</p>
<p>Knowledge-based tests are easier to study for.
On a knowledge-based test, each wrong answer teaches you a concrete lesson you can apply on future tests.
The more question you do, the more you learn.</p>
<details>
<summary>Example of a knowledge-based lesson</summary>
<p>A history exam might ask a question like &#34;When was the US Constitution ratified?&#34;</p>
<p>Suppose you pick answer &#34;(a) 1776&#34;.
Then you look at the answer key and you see that the correct answer was actually &#34;(b) 1789&#34;.</p>
<p>This correct answer provides an immediate and obvious lesson.
You can make a flashcard that says &#34;year Constitution ratified&#34; on one side, and &#34;1789&#34; on the other.</p>
</details>
<p>Skills-based tests don&#39;t repeat themselves; at least not so obviously.
On a skill-based test, like the LSAT, you have to dig deeper to learn a useful lesson.</p>
<details>
<summary>Example of a skill-based lesson</summary>
<p>The LSAT asks questions like: &#34;Which of the following would most weaken the argument above?&#34;</p>
<p>Suppose you pick answer &#34;(a) Zebras have stripes.&#34;
But in fact, the correct answer was &#34;(b) Zebras sometimes do not have stripes.&#34;</p>
<p>What can you learn from this mistake?
It is unlikely that the next LSAT will ask you about Zebras.
Instead, you&#39;ll need to revisit the argument to puzzle out why &#34;sometimes not&#34; weakened it.</p>
</details>
<p>Ironically, on a skills test, doing more questions can lead to worse results.
When you practice in volume, you&#39;re likely to practice sloppily, entrenching bad habits.
To study well for the LSAT you have to study smarter not harder.</p>
<h2 id="whats-different-about-the-lightweight-lsat-approach">What&#39;s different about <em>the lightweight LSAT</em> approach?</h2>
<p>Most other test prep systems aim to be complete.
They teach you how to handle every possible situation that has ever happened on the LSAT.
But when you go to actually take the test, all this knowledge gets in your way.</p>
<p>In contrast, <em>the lightweight LSAT</em> aims to offer you with flexible tools you can <em>actually use</em> on test day.
These flexible tools are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Patterns</strong> - memorizing common <a href="https://lightweightlsat.com/how-to-study/patterns/">patterns</a> helps you navigate the test more efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Skills</strong> - practicing fundamental <a href="https://lightweightlsat.com/how-to-study/practice/#skill-practice">skills</a> helps you approach the test more confidently.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hi! <img alt="👋" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@14.1.2/assets/svg/1f44b.svg" title=":wave:"/> I&#39;m Graham. 
I graduated from Yale Law in 2016, and now work as a community organizer in Alaska.</p>
<p>More relevantly to you, in May 2020, I scored a 180 on the LSAT.
To be fair, I got that perfect score after 4 years of teaching the LSAT.</p>
<p>As an LSAT tutor, I helped hundreds of students like you raise their LSAT scores.
I also saw what doesn&#39;t work, what leads you astray and prevents you from achieving your goals.</p>
<p>This website is my way of giving back.
I hope it helps make your LSAT studies less stressful and more effective.</p>

<p>This website describes a system that works for my brain.
Your brain is different.
So you <em>must</em> adapt my system for yourself.</p>
<p>Here are some practical tips for making the <em>the lightweight LSAT</em> work for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test out ideas.</strong> Try to apply my suggestions one at a time. Use practice questions to run mini-experiments to test whether my recommendations work for you.</li>
<li><strong>Start small and slow.</strong> Try out new skills on easier questions and without a timer. Gradually add in difficulty and time pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Perfect your process.</strong> You can&#39;t directly control your score, you can only control how you approach each question.</li>
<li><strong>Treat your results as information.</strong> Learn from your failures and successes, rather than making them into a judgment about your worth as a human being.</li>
<li><strong>Aim to be smoother, more reliable, and more confident.</strong> Rather than obsessing over your &#34;objective&#34; score, learn to trust your &#34;subjective&#34; sense of competence. </li>
<li><strong>Expect non-linear growth, including plateaus, dips, and jumps.</strong> You won&#39;t hit your personal best every time.</li>
<li><strong>Jump around.</strong> Explore the parts of this website that most interest you. Ignore anything that doesn&#39;t help you. And revisit pages to find nuance you missed the first time.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is version 0.7 of <em>the lightweight LSAT</em>.
In other words, it&#39;s still a rough draft.
There&#39;s considerable room for improvement.</p>
