<p>I-I, say that you remember! It&#39;s the month of I, so we&#39;re going to get personal again. Kind of. A little.</p>
<p>One of the most important skills of a developer is the ability to exchange information, and more specifically, to give suggestions and explanations. To explain explanations: I&#39;d say the goal of an explanation is to give someone information that 1) they don&#39;t know and 2) is useful. </p>
<p>In my time working, and also being a person, I&#39;ve done that badly many times, and seen it done badly as well. I&#39;m not some sort of communication expert, but I&#39;ve found a loose structure that helps me avoid some common pitfalls. I&#39;ll call it the explanation loop, which sounds much more official than it actually is.</p>

<p>When you explain or suggest something, you make sure you&#39;re doing it in an information-seeking and empathy-providing loop.</p>

#</a>The story</h2>
<p>I&#39;m going to tell two stories that, in my opinion, show opposite ends of explanations gone wrong.</p>

##</a>Underestimating knowledge is frustrating and wastes time</h3>
<p>Once, a more senior dev was about to give me a proposed improvement to my code. Before proposing their suggestion, they asked if I knew a specific term. I said no, and made an educated guess, which was wrong. The senior dev then went into a detailed explanation - seconds into it, I realized I did know the concept, as it was basic middle school math; but I went to school in the French system and didn&#39;t know the term. I couldn&#39;t successfully interrupt them, this explanation took a while, and it wasn&#39;t really useful, as it was only tangentially related to the suggestion. </p>

##</a>Overestimating knowledge is frustrating and wastes time</h3>
<p>A junior teammate asked me for help debugging their code. I started out with my idea of a solution -- but every few words, I could tell they didn&#39;t quite get it, so I&#39;d interrupt myself, ask if I should explain, then continue my explanation. I&#39;d go like &#34;you could go with a functional solution -- actually, sorry, you familiar with functional programming? No? well, here&#39;s what that means... anyway, I was saying, you could write this in a functional way, and destructure the argument -- are you familiar with destructuring? Here&#39;s an example of destructuring on line 17...&#34; In short, I&#39;d mention terms that I assumed were familiar, and since they weren&#39;t, I&#39;d go into a bunch of disparate explanations.</p>
<h3 id="why-we-did-it-wrong"><a href="#why-we-did-it-wrong" aria-label="Anchor link for: why-we-did-it-wrong">
##</a>Why we did it wrong</h3>
<p>I think in those cases, the explainer ran into the main problems when giving explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Misjudging the other person&#39;s level of knowledge</li>
<li>Talking too much</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, these two are related. </p>
<p>If you&#39;re talking too much, you&#39;re not trying to understand whether your explanation is hitting. </p>
<p>If you&#39;ve misjudged how much the other person knows, you&#39;ll probably explain something unnecessarily, or explain things at such high level that you&#39;ll have to backtrack and break them down, which leads you to talking too dang much.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-try-to-do-it-now"><a href="#how-i-try-to-do-it-now" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-i-try-to-do-it-now">
##</a>How I try to do it now</h3>
<p>Over time, I&#39;ve come to develop a loose framework for explanations and suggestions. It goes, basically: </p>
<p><span>1) Empathize</span>
<span>2) Ask for information</span>
<span>3) Provide information</span>
(in a loop)</p>
<p>As an example, if my coworker comes to me for help debugging code, I try to have things go basically like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C: &#34;I need help debugging this code.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: &#34;Sure thing, <span>what&#39;s the problem?&#34;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>C: &#34;So, I am trying to process data from an API, and every now and then, this function is giving me a different output than expected.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: &#34;<span>Huh, weird.</span> <span>Can you show me an example?</span>&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>C: &#34;Yeah, here, if I run it 5 times in a row with the same input, occasionally, the result is different.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: &#34;Hmm. <span>Maybe something has a side effect in this function, like it&#39;s modifying one of the variables you&#39;re depending on...</span>&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I stop there. It&#39;s important not to be afraid of a little bit of silence. My coworker&#39;s response helps me understand their level of information in this particular situation.</p>
<p>Maybe my coworker is very comfortable with what I just said, in which case we&#39;d restart the loop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C: &#34;Yeah, I&#39;ve considered that, and I&#39;ve tried [ie making it functional to avoid side effects, but ran into this issue...]&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: &#34;<span>Right, makes sense. With the way it&#39;s set up now, it&#39;d be be a big refactor. That&#39;s frustrating.</span> <span>Did you find out anything, though, like is there anything that&#39;s definitely not the cause?</span>&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, alternatively, they might want me to elaborate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C: &#34;How do you mean?&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: &#34;<span>Oh, yeah, sometimes you might be affecting a variable that&#39;s defined outside your function - let me find some docs on functional programming, they probably explain that concept...</span>&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Side note, sometimes, the conclusion of all of this is &#34;Well, <span>I&#39;m really not able to help you</span>, let&#39;s figure out next steps.&#34; In my experience, even then, we get there a lot faster when there&#39;s a constant feedback loop.</p>
<h2 id="my-plan"><a href="#my-plan" aria-label="Anchor link for: my-plan">
#</a>My plan</h2>
<p>Underestimating someone&#39;s knowledge is a problem, because you waste time explaining things that they already know. It can be insulting for them, and embarassing for the both of you. </p>
<p>On the other hand, overestimating it puts the person in the awkward position of needing a lot of clarification. You can also end up explaining concepts that are too high-level to be useful, just because you&#39;ve mentioned the technical term and they didn&#39;t know it.</p>
<p>When I use the <span>empathize</span>-<span>ask</span>-<span>provide</span> loop, I am trying to give the other person as much agency as possible in getting the right kind of help. Specifically, if there&#39;s gaps in our communication, the loop brings them out fairly quickly / often, and it stops me from rambling <em>too</em> much.</p>
<h2 id="caveat"><a href="#caveat" aria-label="Anchor link for: caveat">
#</a>Caveat</h2>
<p>I have one big caveat to this: putting on an act defeats the purpose. This scheme can feel a bit unnatural, but the whole point is to be efficient and respectful, and dishonesty is rarely either of those things.</p>
<p>For example, I&#39;m not a fan of pretending I don&#39;t know the problem or solution. I&#39;ve had people think they know the answer to my problem, and try to guide me to it. I find that really condescending. </p>
<p>If I think I know the answer, I&#39;ll say it upfront: &#34;I see this variable is modified on line 17.&#34; Or, if I am in an explicit mentor-mentee situation, where I&#39;m teaching someone, I might say it in a veiled way, like: &#34;I see a place in your function where a variable is being modified, that&#39;s probably what&#39;s making the return inconsistent, did you see that?&#34; My mentee might ask me for details, or want to look on their own - either way, I want to keep them in control.</p>
<h2 id="ps"><a href="#ps" aria-label="Anchor link for: ps">
#</a>PS</h2>
<p>There&#39;s another major caveat, which is that these are live conversations. When you&#39;re dealing in async communication, the scheme is totally different. I might talk about how I deal with that in a further post... or not.</p>
<p>Also, this is my second post about social skills, and again, it feels vulnerable to write about guidelines for that, but I&#39;m convinced social skills take some level of practice and intention for everyone. Anyway, see you next month, K! </p>
