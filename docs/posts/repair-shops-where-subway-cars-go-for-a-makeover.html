The work is part of a scheduled maintenance program, introduced in 1989 and designed to prevent breakdowns before they occur.</p><p>The system works much like a scheduled tuneup on an automobile. Trains roll into the facilities, where they are disassembled, reconditioned to near-factory specifications, and then sent back out into a railroad that functions as New York’s vascular system, pumping more than a billion riders across 345 million miles each year, 24 hours a day, every day.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Motors being disassembled before their overhaul begins.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>On a recent afternoon, at her individual workbench in the cavernous 207th Street facility, Gay Burdick, an electronic equipment maintainer, unfurled a crisp new roll of train signage. It is her job to ensure that the small motors that change the rolling fabric signs from A to Q and 1 to 6, for example, work to perfection.</p><p>“If it’s a clean sign,” she said with obvious pride, “I restored it.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gay Burdick tending to an “end destination” sign in a light box.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>The subway has lately come in for criticism. There have been some notable failures in the system over the last several months, including a number of derailments owing to various causes — human error, faulty tracks, vandalism and perhaps, in one case, loose bolts. The incidents are being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board, but the overhaul teams proudly note the success of the scheduled maintenance.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A “bull gear” revealed inside its case.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Before the overhaul program was introduced, the average distance between failures of a car’s key elements was just 16,000 miles in the 1970s and less than 12,000 in the 1980s, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. But after establishment of the program, it rose to almost 60,000 miles between failures in the 1990s. Now, with the system more or less humming — and the advent of more technologically advanced train fleets that were introduced this century — most cars travel more than 140,000 miles between failures.</p></div><div><p>“The magic,” said Julio Bernard, the superintendent of production planning at the Coney Island shop, “happens in the overhaul.”</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Leonard Mereigh, a Kawasaki representative, inspects the oil level in an R211 gear case at the Coney Island Overhaul Shop.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>New York City has some of the oldest subway cars in the world — some have been in service since the 1980s. Typically, a battered train will arrive at the shop bearing the scars and corrosion earned through thousands of hard miles across the busy, 119-year-old system. The exterior is smudged, the wheels brown, the components smeared with years of soot. But after a few weeks in one of the overhaul shops, it emerges as if off the factory floor.</p></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A functional model used to display and teach air-conditioning concepts and components at the 207th Street Overhaul Shop in Manhattan.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sergey Shifrin, at the Coney Island shop, cleaning the stator surface of an AC motor before it gets rebuilt.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>This scale of this magnificent transformation from grime to gleam is what inspired the photographer Christopher Payne to spend hundreds of hours shuttling between Coney Island and Upper Manhattan since January 2020, to vividly capture the breadth of the work.</p><p>The Coney Island Complex, completed in 1929, is the largest rapid transit yard in North America. Spread over 75 industrial acres just north of Coney Island Creek, the facility includes 28 acres of buildings resembling an unusually clean, quiet factory.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>AC motors loaded onto a carousel of an automatic industrial parts washer at the Coney Island shop.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>There is the electric motor repair shop, the pneumatic shop for brakes and air-conditioning, the car repair shop and the wheel and axle shop. At any given time, the facility is handling between 40 and 45 cars.</p></div><div><p>Nearly 1,000 employees, most of them members of the Transport Workers Union Local 100, toil in concert in three daily round-the-clock shifts to overhaul as many as 1,100 cars per year.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A collection of R142 series subway cars await their refurbished trucks.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>A job on the repair crew is highly coveted; many employees have worked there for years, and they generally take immense pride in their success.

If a wheel is deformed, another machine in the shop can grind it true.

Doors, windows, signage, seats, floor tiles and HVAC are all overhauled. After the cars are placed back on top of the trucks, they roll onto rails astride a long trench about three feet deep, allowing mechanics access to the undercarriage of the fully assembled trains for final inspection.</p></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Current collectors for the latest model subway cars.
