    <h1>Ask HN: Quality of recent gens of Dell/Lenovo laptops worse than 10 years ago?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have been purchasing used/new Lenovo/Dell laptops for the last 7 years, and I have noticed that the build quality of recent models is concerning.</p><p>Lenovo: Ex-company gave me a NEW Carbon X1 around 2019, and the battery only lasted for less than a year (!). On the other side, I bought a used 2017 470S from the same company, added more RAM, didn&#39;t touch anything including the SSD, and I&#39;m still using it in daily coding. I did buy a new battery last month so technically the old batteries lasted for about 7-8 years.</p><p>Dell: I bought 3 laptops + 1 desktop from Dell Refurbished (So the quality should be consistent). 2 laptops + 1 desktop are older models, and 1 is Precision 5550 (2021) that I bought last December. Everything works fine, except for the 5550, which has issues with battery (dropped from 31% to 4% in a few seconds) and (more deadly) charging port (doesn&#39;t charge from time to time). Even if I bought it new in 2021, I would be surprised that it only lasted for a bit over 4 years.</p><p>The other issue is that 5550 uses USB-C ports. I blame on myself not checking it closely before the purchase. I really hate those ports. Why is everyone copying from Mac?</p><p>What&#39;s my option? I can&#39;t really justify the 2,000+ CAD price point for a new laptop, especially if it lasts less than 5 years. I&#39;d prefer a &#34;low-end&#34; workstation with 32GB memory, but because of the price point I can only afford a 16GB non-workstation one. I don&#39;t do gaming any more but I still prefer a good integrated video card. I can&#39;t afford Framework and other Linux laptops because they are expensive and usually don&#39;t operate in Canada so delivery is expensive too.</p><p>I did buy a used Macbook Pro M1 16GB (2021) from my current company last month. I haven&#39;t used it but I&#39;m confident that the hardware is good. The problem is I don&#39;t really like the software, so I figured I still need a Linux box.</p><p>Did you find any sweet spot?</p></div></div></div>
