    <p>This page shows a JPEG XL image, if your browser can handle it! At this point
in time (January 2026) this more or less means only Safari will display the
image, as far as I know. See also <a href="https://caniuse.com/jpegxl">Can I Use</a>.</p>

<p>The person in the image is <a href="https://sneyers.info/">Jon Sneyers</a>, co-author of
the JPEG XL spec and also creator of the “Free Lossless Image Format” that came
before it.</p>
<p>I find JPEG XL interesting because of its history. It once was implemented in
Chrome, but hidden behind a feature flag. Then Chrome said that it did not saw
enough usage, which is unsurprising, really, and it was removed. Now they
blessed it again and are re-adding it! Some of this story is found on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_XL">JPEG XL Wikipedia page</a></p>
