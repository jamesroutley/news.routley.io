    <h1>Millions are visiting the European Alternatives site. What trends are we seeing?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>☝️That’s a screenshot from the publicly open Plausible Analytics dashboard of the European Alternatives <a href="https://european-alternatives.eu/">website</a>, featuring independent, privacy-friendly digital tools.</p> <p>With almost 2M visitors, 2.3M total visits, and 8.5M pageviews, this library is no longer a niche project—it’s the go-to destination for users looking for independent, privacy-friendly tools. Over 1 million of the ~2 million all-time visitors came in 2025 alone—and we’re only in March.</p> <p>Let’s use the analytics <a href="https://plausible.io/european-alternatives.eu">dashboard</a> to see what trends are emerging and what is the demand looking like for EU-built, privacy-friendly tech.</p> <ol id="markdown-toc"> <li><a href="#1100-surge-in-2025-traffic" id="markdown-toc-1100-surge-in-2025-traffic">1100% surge in 2025 traffic</a></li> <li><a href="#reddit-surpasses-google-while-privacy-friendly-search-engines-gain-traction" id="markdown-toc-reddit-surpasses-google-while-privacy-friendly-search-engines-gain-traction">Reddit surpasses Google, while privacy-friendly search engines gain traction</a></li> <li><a href="#top-5-categories-what-are-people-looking-for" id="markdown-toc-top-5-categories-what-are-people-looking-for">Top 5 categories: What are people looking for?</a></li> <li><a href="#not-just-a-european-trenddemand-goes-beyond-the-eu-borders" id="markdown-toc-not-just-a-european-trenddemand-goes-beyond-the-eu-borders">Not just a European trend—demand goes beyond the EU borders</a></li> <li><a href="#european-countries-leading-and-lagging-in-the-shift-to-privacy-friendly-tools" id="markdown-toc-european-countries-leading-and-lagging-in-the-shift-to-privacy-friendly-tools">European countries leading (and lagging) in the shift to privacy-friendly tools</a></li> <li><a href="#which-european-tools-are-winning" id="markdown-toc-which-european-tools-are-winning">Which European tools are winning? </a></li> <li><a href="#need-a-hand-in-deciding-which-tools-to-go-with" id="markdown-toc-need-a-hand-in-deciding-which-tools-to-go-with">Need a hand in deciding which tools to go with?</a></li> <li><a href="#privacy-friendly-web-analytics-is-on-the-rise" id="markdown-toc-privacy-friendly-web-analytics-is-on-the-rise">Privacy-friendly web analytics is on the rise</a></li> </ol> <h2 id="1100-surge-in-2025-traffic">1100% surge in 2025 traffic</h2> <p>If we filter the dashboard by “Year to date” period, i.e. 2025 so far, we see there have been 1.3 million visitors to the website, with a surge of 1.1K%. </p> <p><img src="https://plausible.io/uploads/2025-stats-for-eu-alternatives.png" alt="1100% surge in 2025 traffic" title="1100% surge in 2025 traffic"/></p> <p>Another interesting number is the “time on page,” which is 2m47s spent on average. This goes on to show that people are interested and engaging well with the library.</p> <h2 id="reddit-surpasses-google-while-privacy-friendly-search-engines-gain-traction">Reddit surpasses Google, while privacy-friendly search engines gain traction</h2> <p>Look at the Top Sources report for 2025 so far:</p> <p><img src="https://plausible.io/uploads/top-sources-2025-eu-alternatives.png" alt="top-sources-2025-eu-alternatives" title="top-sources-2025-eu-alternatives"/></p> <p>Google is typically the dominant search driver for most websites—but not here. Reddit ranks as the second-largest traffic source, bringing in 311K visitors—significantly more than Google (193K). This isn’t a regular thing we see with sites.</p> <p>This suggests that people aren’t just searching for alternatives but are actively discussing and recommending them in forums, subreddits, and privacy-conscious communities.</p> <p>But here’s another interesting insight: Privacy-friendly search engines are also key traffic sources:</p> <ul> <li>DuckDuckGo: 33.8K visitors</li> <li>Ecosia: 13.5K visitors</li> <li>Qwant: 10.8K visitors</li> </ul> <p>This says something about the increasing preference for privacy-friendly tools, i.e., more people are actively using privacy-friendly search engines to discover other privacy-friendly alternatives.</p> <h2 id="top-5-categories-what-are-people-looking-for">Top 5 categories: What are people looking for?</h2> <p>A quick look at the “Top Pages” report tells us about the most popular top 5 categories:</p> <p>- Email providers</p> <p>- Search Engines</p> <p>- Cloud Computing Platforms</p> <p>- Navigation Apps</p> <p>- Web Analytics Services</p> <p>Upon expanding the report, we can take a deeper look at the most popular categories in terms of unique visitors, while comparing the engagement metrics.</p> <p><img src="https://plausible.io/uploads/top-pages-eu-alternatives.png" alt="top-pages-eu-alternatives" title="top-pages-eu-alternatives"/></p> <p><strong>B2B categories win?</strong></p> <p>While categories like email providers, search engines, and navigation apps attract a large B2C audience, B2B categories are more diverse and consistently rank high. </p> <p>Businesses are actively seeking privacy-friendly analytics, hosting, and infrastructure alternatives, driving growth in EU-built tools.</p> <h2 id="not-just-a-european-trenddemand-goes-beyond-the-eu-borders">Not just a European trend—demand goes beyond the EU borders</h2> <p>Looking at the <a href="https://plausible.io/european-alternatives.eu?period=all&amp;keybindHint=A&amp;comparison=off&amp;match_day_of_week=true">all-time Countries report</a>: European countries make up the bulk of visitors (as expected), but the United States ranks fourth, sending over 100K visitors to the site! </p> <p>Even Canada and India make an appearance in the top 25, contributing decent amounts of visitors to the site.</p> <p>If you scroll all the way down, or simply look at the “Map view,” there’s hardly any part of the globe that’s not participating in the shift towards privacy-focused digital tools.</p> <p><img src="https://plausible.io/uploads/map-view.png" alt="map-view" title="map-view"/></p> <p>Privacy-conscious users are everywhere.</p>  <p>Germany leads in visitor numbers, with 379K, and contributing 20.5% of the total traffic all-time! This is followed by the Netherlands (141K) and France (135K). These countries show significant engagement with European digital alternatives.</p> <p>On the lower end, Guernsey recorded 130 visitors, while regions like Vatican City State and Saint Martin (French part) had 3 each. The variation in engagement levels may reflect differences in population size, internet adoption rates, etc.</p>  <p>The dashboard has an <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/outbound-link-click-tracking">Outbound link click goal</a> configured, which is useful in understanding which listed tools eventually attract real visitors. Once we filter the dashboard by this goal (see it <a href="https://plausible.io/european-alternatives.eu?f=is,goal,Outbound%20Link:%20Click&amp;period=all&amp;keybindHint=A&amp;comparison=off&amp;match_day_of_week=true">here</a>), we can see which URLs were clicked.</p> <p>From these results, these are the top 10 tools receiving traffic from the EU alternatives website: </p> <ol> <li><a href="https://mailbox.org/en/">Mailbox.org</a> (email provider)</li> <li><a href="https://proton.me/mail">ProtonMail</a> (email provider)</li> <li><a href="https://soverin.com/">Soverin</a> (email provider)</li> <li><a href="https://www.startpage.com/">Startpage</a> (search engine)</li> <li><a href="https://www.qwant.com/">Qwant</a> (search engine)</li> <li><a href="https://posteo.de/en">Posteo</a> (email provider)</li> <li><a href="https://www.ecosia.org/">Ecosia</a> (search engine)</li> <li><a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/">Scaleway</a> (cloud provider)</li> <li><a href="https://www.startmail.com/">Startmail</a> (email provider)</li> <li><a href="https://good-search.org/en/">Good search</a> (search engine)</li> </ol> <p>And if we look at the all-time data, there’s a whopping 1.2M total outbound clicks from the website to such tools, that’s more than half of the total all-time visits to the library.</p> <p><img src="https://plausible.io/uploads/outbound-clicks-.png" alt="outbound-clicks" title="outbound-clicks"/></p> <p>And conversions aren’t just from Europe—the U.S. audience alone has a 16.8% conversion rate (check <a href="https://plausible.io/european-alternatives.eu?f=is,goal,Outbound%20Link:%20Click&amp;f=is,country,US&amp;l=US,United%20States&amp;period=all&amp;keybindHint=A&amp;comparison=off&amp;match_day_of_week=true">here</a>)!</p>  <p>We recently vetted many EU-built B2B tools and picked out a few of our favourites. They’re all:</p> <ul> <li>Built in the EU – Companies headquartered in a European country.</li> <li>Hosted in the EU – Ensuring your data doesn’t leave the European borders and stays compliant with European privacy laws.</li> <li>GDPR-compliant –  Tools that align with European data protection laws.</li> <li>High quality – Competitive with mainstream solutions.</li> <li>Privacy-focused – Respecting user data and following GDPR regulations.</li> </ul> <p>Check out our <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/european-privacy-friendly-tools-for-business">handpicked list of 16 privacy-focused European tools</a>.</p> <h2 id="privacy-friendly-web-analytics-is-on-the-rise">Privacy-friendly web analytics is on the rise</h2> <p>We started Plausible Analytics six years ago as a privacy-first, <a href="https://plausible.io/data-policy">GDPR-compliant</a>, <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-cookies">cookieless</a> and muuuch <a href="https://plausible.io/simple-web-analytics">easier-to-use</a> alternative to Google Analytics.</p> <p>So, we took a look at how our category is doing:</p> <ul> <li>5th most popular category in the library</li> <li>9th most visited page overall</li> <li>More than a 2,700% increase in unique visitors in 2025</li> </ul> <p>The demand for privacy-friendly web analytics is booming.
