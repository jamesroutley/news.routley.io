    <h1>A Software Development Methodology for Disciplined LLM Collaboration</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<hr/>

<p dir="auto">A structured approach for working with AI on development projects. This methodology addresses common issues like code bloat, architectural drift, and context dilution through systematic constraints.</p>

<p dir="auto">AI systems work on Question → Answer patterns. When you ask for broad, multi-faceted implementations, you typically get:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Functions that work but lack structure</li>
<li>Repeated code across components</li>
<li>Architectural inconsistency over sessions</li>
<li>Context dilution causing output drift</li>
<li>More debugging time than planning time</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">The methodology uses four stages with systematic constraints and validation checkpoints. Each stage builds on empirical data rather than assumptions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Planning saves debugging time.</strong> Planning thoroughly upfront typically prevents days of fixing architectural issues later.</p>

<p dir="auto">The benchmarking suite (built first) provides performance data throughout development. Feed this data back to the AI for optimization decisions based on measurements rather than guesswork.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Decision Processing:</strong> AI handles &#34;Can you do A?&#34; more reliably than &#34;Can you do A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H?&#34;</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Context Management:</strong> Small files and bounded problems prevent the AI from juggling multiple concerns simultaneously.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Empirical Validation:</strong> Performance data replaces subjective assessment. Decisions come from measurable outcomes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Systematic Constraints:</strong> Architectural checkpoints, file size limits, and dependency gates force consistent behavior.</p>

<details>
<summary>What problem led you to create this methodology?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">I kept having to restate my preferences and architectural requirements to AI systems. It didn&#39;t matter which language or project I was working on - the AI would consistently produce either bloated monolithic code or underdeveloped implementations with issues throughout.</p>
<p dir="auto">This led me to examine the meta-principles driving code quality and software architecture. I questioned whether pattern matching in AI models might be more effective when focused on underlying software principles rather than surface-level syntax. Since pattern matching is logic-driven and machines fundamentally operate on simple question-answer pairs, I realized that functions with multiple simultaneous questions were overwhelming the system.</p>
<p dir="auto">The breakthrough came from understanding that everything ultimately transpiles to binary - a series of &#34;can you do this? → yes/no&#34; decisions. This insight shaped my approach: instead of issuing commands, ask focused questions in proper context. Rather than mentally managing complex setups alone, collaborate with AI to devise systematic plans.</p>
<hr/>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How did you discover these specific constraints work?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">Through extensive trial and error. AI systems will always tend to drift even under constraints, but they&#39;re significantly more accurate with structured boundaries than without them. You occasionally need to remind the AI of its role to prevent deviation - like managing a well-intentioned toddler that knows the rules but sometimes pushes boundaries trying to satisfy you.</p>
<p dir="auto">These tools are far from perfect, but they&#39;re effective instruments for software development when properly constrained.</p>
<hr/>
</details>
<details>
<summary>What failures or frustrations shaped this approach?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">Maintenance hell was the primary driver. I grew tired of responses filled with excessive praise: &#34;You have found the solution!&#34;, &#34;You have redefined the laws of physics with your paradigm-shifting script!&#34; This verbose fluff wastes time, tokens, and patience without contributing to productive development.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of venting frustration on social media about AI being &#34;just a dumb tool,&#34; I decided to find methods that actually work. My approach may not help everyone, but I hope it benefits those who share similar AI development frustrations.</p>
<hr/>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How consistently do you follow your own methodology?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">Since creating the documentation, I haven&#39;t deviated. Whenever I see the model producing more lines than my methodology restricts, I immediately interrupt generation with a flag: &#34;<g-emoji alias="bangbang">‼️</g-emoji> ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATION, ADHERE TO PRINCIPLES <g-emoji alias="bangbang">‼️</g-emoji>&#34; I then provide the method instructions again, depending on how context is stored and which model I&#39;m using.</p>
<hr/>
</details>
<details>
<summary>What happens when you deviate from it?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">I become genuinely uncomfortable. Once I see things starting to degrade or become tangled, I compulsively need to organize and optimize. Deviation simply isn&#39;t an option anymore.</p>
<hr/>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Which principles do you find hardest to maintain?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">Not cursing at the AI when it drifts during complex algorithms! But seriously, it&#39;s a machine - it&#39;s not perfect, and neither are we.</p>
<hr/>
</details>

<details>
<summary>When did you start using AI for programming?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">In August 2024, I created a RuneLite theme pack, but one of the plugin overlays didn&#39;t match my custom layout. I opened a GitHub issue (creating my first GitHub account to do so) requesting a customization option. The response was: &#34;It&#39;s not a priority - if you want it, build it yourself.&#34;</p>
<p dir="auto">I used ChatGPT to guide me through forking RuneLite and creating a plugin. This experience sparked intense interest in underlying software principles rather than just syntax.</p>
<hr/>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How has your approach evolved over time?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">I view development like a book: syntax is the cover, logic is the content itself. Rather than learning syntax structures, I focused on core meta-principles - how software interacts, how logic flows, different algorithm types. I quickly realized everything reduces to the same foundation: question and answer sequences.</p>
<p dir="auto">Large code structures are essentially chaotic meetings - one coordinator fielding questions and answers from multiple sources, trying to provide correct responses without mix-ups or misinterpretation. If this applies to human communication, it must apply to software principles.</p>
<hr/>
</details>
<details>
<summary>What were your biggest mistakes with AI collaboration?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">Expecting it to intuitively understand my requirements, provide perfect fixes, be completely honest, and act like a true expert. This was all elaborate roleplay that produced poor code. While fine for single-purpose scripts, it failed completely for scalable codebases.</p>
<p dir="auto">I learned not to feed requirements and hope for the best. Instead, I needed to collaborate actively - create plans, ask for feedback on content clarity, and identify uncertainties. This gradual process taught me the AI&#39;s actual capabilities and most effective collaboration methods.</p>
<hr/>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why 150 lines exactly?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">Multiple benefits: easy readability, clear understanding, modularity enforcement, architectural clarity, simple maintenance, component testing, optimal AI context retention, reusability, and KISS principle adherence.</p>
<hr/>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How did you determine Phase 0 requirements?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">From meta-principles of software: if it displays, it must run; if it runs, it can be measured; if it can be measured, it can be optimized; if it can be optimized, it can be reliable; if it can be reliable, it can be trusted.</p>
<p dir="auto">Regardless of project type, anything requiring architecture needs these foundations. You must ensure changes don&#39;t negatively impact the entire system. A single line modification in a nested function might work perfectly but cause 300ms boot time regression for all users.</p>
<p dir="auto">By testing during development, you catch inefficiencies early. Integration from the start means simply hooking up new components and running tests via command line - minimal time investment with actual value returned. I prefer validation and consistency throughout development rather than programming blind.</p>
<hr/>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you handle projects that don&#39;t fit the methodology?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">I adapt them to fit, or if truly impossible, I adjust the method itself. This is one methodology - I can generate countless variations as needed. Having spent 6700+ hours in AI interactions across multiple domains (not just software), I&#39;ve developed strong system comprehension that enables creating adjusted methodologies on demand.</p>
<hr/>
</details>
<details>
<summary>What&#39;s the learning curve for new users?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">I cannot accurately answer this question. I&#39;ve learned that I&#39;m neurologically different - what I perceive as easy or obvious isn&#39;t always the case for others. This question is better addressed by someone who has actually used this methodology to determine its learning curve.</p>
<hr/>
</details>
<details>
<summary>When shouldn&#39;t someone use this approach?</summary>
<hr/>
<p dir="auto">If you&#39;re not serious about projects, despise AI, dislike planning, don&#39;t care about modularization, or are just writing simple scripts. However, for anything requiring reliability, I believe this is currently the most effective method.</p>
<p dir="auto">You still need programming fundamentals to use this methodology effectively - it&#39;s significantly more structured than ad-hoc approaches.</p>
