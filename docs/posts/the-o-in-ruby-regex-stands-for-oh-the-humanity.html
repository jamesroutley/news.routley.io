<p>Your code using the <code>/o</code> modifier</p>

<p>Hi there! Do you like Regex? Do you like performance? Do you like creating confounding bugs for yourself rooted in the mechanics of the Ruby VM itself?</p>
<p>If you said yes to all of the above, have I got a feature for you!</p>
<p>But first, let’s start with a story.</p>
<h3 id="the-cliffs-of-insanity">The cliffs of insanity</h3>
<p>I was recently reviewing some code, and part of the functionality was about matching. A class took an array of strings, and you could call a method to see if an input matched part of any of the strings. Stripped down, it was effectively the following code:</p>
<pre><code>class Matcher
  def initialize(matchables)
    @matchables = matchables
  end

  def matches_any?(input)
    @matchables.any? { |m| m.match?(/#{input}/io) }
  end
end
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>I <em>know</em> there are some of you reading this code and thinking “does this really need a regex?”, “couldn’t it just use <code>include?</code> and some downcasing?”, “does this even need to exist?”, etc, etc. I see you, I hear you, I’d probably think the same, and I <em>promise</em> you the specifics of this method aren’t that important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Functionally, the code looked <em>ok</em> to me. I knew what <code>/i</code> was (a regex in <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/3.4.1/Regexp.html#class-Regexp-label-Case-Insensitive+Mode">case-insensitive mode</a>), but I didn’t recognize <code>/o</code>. It didn’t seem critically important to lookup yet. Tests were not exhaustive but were green, and so I went to run the code in a console:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby"><span>Matcher</span><span>.</span>new(<span>[</span><span>&#34;Ruby!&#34;</span><span>]</span>)<span>.</span>matches_any?(<span>&#34;ruby&#34;</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>true</span>
<span>Matcher</span><span>.</span>new(<span>[</span><span>&#34;Ruby!&#34;</span><span>]</span>)<span>.</span>matches_any?(<span>&#34;something else&#34;</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>true</span>
<span>Matcher</span><span>.</span>new(<span>[</span><span>&#34;Ruby!&#34;</span><span>]</span>)<span>.</span>matches_any?(<span>&#34;javascript&#34;</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Well, that seemed broken. Assuming it was a bug, I looked at the code to see what was wrong. But nothing stuck out. The code <em>seemed</em> ok, and simple:</p>
<pre><code>@matchables.any? |m| m.match?(/#{input/io) }
</code></pre>
<p>So I deconstructed the code and ran it directly, outside the class:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby"><span>[</span><span>&#34;Ruby!&#34;</span><span>].</span>any? { <span>|</span>m<span>|</span> m<span>.</span>match?(<span>/ruby/io</span>) }
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>true</span>
<span>[</span><span>&#34;Ruby!&#34;</span><span>].</span>any? { <span>|</span>m<span>|</span> m<span>.</span>match?(<span>/something else/io</span>) }
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>false</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Even weirder. Run directly, it ran as expected. What if I started a new console, and ran the original class in a different order?</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby"><span>Matcher</span><span>.</span>new(<span>[</span><span>&#34;Ruby!&#34;</span><span>]</span>)<span>.</span>matches_any?(<span>&#34;something else&#34;</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>false</span>
<span>Matcher</span><span>.</span>new(<span>[</span><span>&#34;Ruby!&#34;</span><span>]</span>)<span>.</span>matches_any?(<span>&#34;ruby&#34;</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>false</span>
<span>Matcher</span><span>.</span>new(<span>[</span><span>&#34;something else&#34;</span><span>]</span>)<span>.</span>matches_any?(<span>&#34;Ruby!&#34;</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Well, that was interesting. It seems like whatever value I sent to <code>matches_any?</code> was cached for every run after that point, even for <em>brand new objects</em>.</p>
<p>I looked through the class again. There was no weird memoization. No class-level variables. No thread locals. I was instantiating the class each time I ran <code>matches_any?</code>. I was out of ideas for the predictable things that cause unpredictable results. What else was there?</p>
<h3 id="o-the-humanity">/o the humanity!</h3>
<p>With nothing else to investigate, I finally looked up the docs for what the <code>/o</code> regex modifier does. <code>/o</code> is referred to as “Interpolation mode”, which sounded pretty harmless. The Ruby docs have a succinct section on the expected behavior: <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/3.4.1/Regexp.html#class-Regexp-label-Interpolation+Mode">https://ruby-doc.org/3.4.1/Regexp.html#class-Regexp-label-Interpolation+Mode</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modifier o means that the first time a literal regexp with interpolations is encountered, the generated Regexp object is saved and used for all future evaluations of that literal regexp</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just reading that, I still wasn’t sure I’d expect what I was seeing. It almost sounded like internally Ruby would cache <em>each</em> different interpolation that comes through. As if it would maybe reuse an internal regex if the same string value was interpolated. They provide a code example that makes it a little clearer:</p>
<pre><code>def letters; sleep 5; /[A-Z][a-z]/; end
words = %w[abc def xyz]
start = Time.now
words.each {|word| word.match(/\A[#{letters}]+\z/) }
Time.now - start # =&gt; 15.0174892

start = Time.now
words.each {|word| word.match(/\A[#{letters}]+\z/o) }
Time.now - start # =&gt; 5.0010866
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>letters</code> method in the first example is called three times. One time for each iteration, as expected, taking 15 seconds total.</p>
<p>In the second example, the code iterates three times, but the <code>letters</code> method is called <em>once</em>, taking 5 seconds total.</p>
<p>Knowing that, I went back to the original code with new eyes:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby"><span>class</span> <span>Matcher</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span>(matchables)
    @matchables <span>=</span> matchables
  <span>end</span>
	
  <span>def</span> <span>matches_any?</span>(input)
    @matchables<span>.</span>any? { <span>|</span>m<span>|</span>
      m<span>.</span>match?(
        <span>/</span><span>#{</span>input<span>}</span><span>/io</span> <span># This is run once, _ever_</span>
      )
    }
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>What that meant for me is that the regular expression inside of <code>matches_any?</code> was interpolating the <em>first value it <strong>ever</strong> receives</em>. Past that point the regex <em>never interpolated another value</em>.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the developer had read about it as a potential regex optimization. It seemed harmless enough, so they added it. Now that I knew why I was hitting the issue, I removed the <code>/o</code> and everything started working properly.</p>
<p>But it still was not clear to me <em>how</em> this was possible. What in the world is Ruby doing internally? Let’s figure it out together.</p>
<h3 id="inside-the-vm">Inside the VM</h3>
<p>Sometimes the only way to understand a behavior in Ruby is to drop a bit lower. Let’s disassemble the code into Ruby VM byte code, to see if it gives us any clues. I’ll use the <code>DATA</code> feature to be able to put it into a script directly (you can find more about <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/3.4.1/Object.html#DATA">that syntax here</a>).</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby">puts <span>RubyVM</span><span>::</span><span>InstructionSequence</span><span>.</span>compile(<span>DATA</span><span>.</span>read)<span>.</span>disassemble
	
<span>__END__
</span><span>class Matcher
</span><span>  def initialize(matchables)
</span><span>    @matchables = matchables
</span><span>  end
</span><span>	
</span><span>  def matches_any?(input)
</span><span>    @matchables.any? { |m| m.match?(/#{input}/io) }
</span><span>  end
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre></div><p>There are a bunch of other instructions you’ll see if you run that code, but we’ll focus on the instructions specific to the block in the <code>matches_any?</code> method:</p>
<pre><code># { |m| m.match?(/#{input/io) }

== disasm: #&lt;ISeq:block in matches_any?@&lt;compiled&gt;:7 (7,21)-(7,51)&gt;
local table (size: 1, argc: 1 [opts: 0, rest: -1, post: 0, block: -1, kw: -1@-1, kwrest: -1])
[ 1] m@0&lt;AmbiguousArg&gt;
0000 getlocal_WC_0                          m@0                       (   7)[LiBc]
0002 once                                   block (2 levels) in matches_any?, &lt;is:0&gt;
0005 opt_send_without_block                 &lt;calldata!mid:match?, argc:1, ARGS_SIMPLE&gt;
0007 leave                                  [Br]
</code></pre>
<p>It describes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting local variable <code>m</code></li>
<li>Running the… <code>once</code> instruction?</li>
<li>Calling <code>m</code> with <code>opt_send_without_block</code> with a method id (<code>mid</code>) of <code>match?</code></li>
<li>Then <code>leave</code>ing.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these instructions are <em>very</em> common in the Ruby VM. All except one - the <code>once</code> instruction. I’ve never heard of that!</p>
<p>What is <code>once</code>? It can’t exist almost solely for the purposes of this extremely strange regex modifier, can it? Surely this modifier is not built into the very <em>bones</em> of Ruby?</p>
<h3 id="once-upon-a-time"><code>once</code> upon a time</h3>
<p>If you are ever curious to know how Ruby VM instructions get interpreted in CRuby, there is a central file to all of it called <code>insns.def</code>. It contains all of the available YARV (Yet Another Ruby VM) instructions in a C-esque format which is compiled into an actual C file as part of building the language.</p>
<p>In normal program execution, without JIT optimizations applied (like YJIT, ZJIT, MJIT), you can trace how each instruction is executed by reading <code>insns.def</code>. Let’s look at the <code>once</code> definition to see what kind of dark magic is being invoked.</p>
<pre><code>/* run iseq only once */
DEFINE_INSN
once
(ISEQ iseq, ISE ise)
()
(VALUE val)
{
    val = vm_once_dispatch(ec, iseq, ise);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In essence it’s very simple - it takes the instruction and runs it using <code>vm_once_dispatch</code>. <code>iseq</code> is the instruction sequence, and <code>ise</code> is an “Inline Storage Entry”, which is a place to cache an instruction result. What does <code>vm_once_dispatch</code> do?</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span>static</span> VALUE
<span>vm_once_dispatch</span>(rb_execution_context_t <span>*</span>ec, ISEQ iseq, ISE is)
{
    rb_thread_t <span>*</span>th <span>=</span> rb_ec_thread_ptr(ec);
    rb_thread_t <span>*</span><span>const</span> RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE <span>=</span> (rb_thread_t <span>*</span>)(<span>0x1</span>);
	
  again:
    <span>if</span> (is<span>-&gt;</span>once.running_thread <span>==</span> RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE) {
        <span>return</span> is<span>-&gt;</span>once.value;
    }
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (is<span>-&gt;</span>once.running_thread <span>==</span> NULL) {
        VALUE val;
        is<span>-&gt;</span>once.running_thread <span>=</span> th;
        val <span>=</span> rb_ensure(vm_once_exec, (VALUE)iseq, vm_once_clear, (VALUE)is);

</span><span></span>        is<span>-&gt;</span>once.running_thread <span>=</span> RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE; <span>/* success */</span>
        <span>return</span> val;
    }
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (is<span>-&gt;</span>once.running_thread <span>==</span> th) {
        <span>/* recursive once */</span>
        <span>return</span> vm_once_exec((VALUE)iseq);
    }
    <span>else</span> {
        <span>/* waiting for finish */</span>
        RUBY_VM_CHECK_INTS(ec);
        rb_thread_schedule();
        <span>goto</span> again;
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>It’s a little daunting at first look, but broken down it’s just some simple if statements:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>is-&gt;once.running_thread == RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE</code></li>
<li><code>is-&gt;once.running_thread == NULL</code></li>
<li><code>is-&gt;once.running_thread == th</code></li>
<li>Otherwise you are a different thread, and you have to wait. You’ll keep checking for a value immediately, or get rescheduled and check it a little later (once some other threads have been given a slice of time)</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ve broken down the logic. Now let’s break down the implications.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you use <code>/o</code> in your regex, the content of the regex will be evaluated <em>once</em>, <strong>ever</strong>. Even if it’s inside of an instance method. Even if it’s inside of a loop with a thousand iterations. It will <em>never</em> be evaluated again. That’s the content you’ve got for your regex. This is why the code I was reviewing was so confusing - even though it lived in an object, and was only created local to that method - it <strong>implicitly created a constant, immutable value</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we can understand how the original code worked, by evaluating it relative to how the CRuby internals work. The first call we have no value set - past that point we will always use the value literally cached inside of the VM itself:</p>
<pre><code># We haven&#39;t run the code yet, so in our starting state:
#   is-&gt;once.running_thread == NULL
#   m.match?(/#{input}/io)
&gt; Matcher.new([&#34;Ruby!&#34;]).matches_any?(&#34;something else&#34;)
# Now we&#39;ve run the code once, we&#39;re done!
#   is-&gt;once.running_thread == RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE
#   m.match?(/something else/io)

&gt; Matcher.new([&#34;Ruby!&#34;]).matches_any?(&#34;ruby&#34;)
#   is-&gt;once.running_thread == RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE
#   m.match?(/something else/io)

&gt; Matcher.new([&#34;something else&#34;]).matches_any?(&#34;Ruby!&#34;)
#   is-&gt;once.running_thread == RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE
#   m.match?(/something else/io)
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>If the code has not been run yet, you’re in the starting state of <code>is-&gt;once.running_thread == NULL</code>. This means two things. One is clear - the first code to run this gets to determine the value set. Two is a little less clear - it is non-deterministic what value will win!</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve read any of <a href="https://jpcamara.com/2024/06/04/your-ruby-programs.html">my series on Ruby concurrency</a>, you’ll know I love a good thread non-determinism example. Here we create a method containing an “interpolation mode” regex. Then we create five threads, and call the method from each thread. To introduce some context switching, we sleep for random amounts (this could also be caused by IO, or long-running code, alternatively):</p>
<pre><code>def once_and_for_all(input)
  /#{input}/o
end

5.times.map do |i|
  Thread.new { sleep(rand); p once_and_for_all(i) }
end.map(&amp;:join)

# Run it once, it prints /3/ 5 times
# Run it again, it prints /1/ 5 times
# Run it again...
</code></pre>
<p>In my first run, I see the regex <code>/3/</code> printed 5 times. Each run gave me a different result. Run this code several times and you will likely see a different value printed each time. It may repeat at times, but there will be no consistency.</p>
<p>Quite the behavior! This is pretty close to being a <a href="https://jpcamara.com/2024/06/04/your-ruby-programs.html#heisenbugs">Heisenbug</a>. Non-determinism at its finest.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The code has been run already, but now it’s being run again before being set as <code>RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE</code>: <code>is-&gt;once.running_thread == th</code>. This can only happen within the same thread, and it’s there to handle <em>recursion</em>. It’s hard to imagine using the <code>/o</code> at all, let alone <em>recursively</em>. If you were to do that I’d only have one question for you: “Who hurt you?”</li>
</ol>
<p>But let’s do the damn thing. Here’s a recursive case of the <code>/o</code> modifier. Heaven help us.</p>
<pre><code>def recursive_regex(n)
  puts &#34;Evaluating regex for n=#{n}&#34;
  if n &gt; 0
    /#{recursive_regex(n - 1)}/o # This calls itself recursively
  else
    &#34;base&#34;
  end
end

recursive_regex(5)
# Evaluating regex for n=5
# Evaluating regex for n=4
# Evaluating regex for n=3
# Evaluating regex for n=2
# Evaluating regex for n=1
# Evaluating regex for n=0

recursive_regex(5)
# Evaluating regex for n=5

# Call it with whatever value you want, it&#39;s never running the method recursively again.
recursive_regex(500)
# Evaluating regex for n=500
</code></pre>
<p>I promise it hurt me more to write that than it did for you to read it.</p>
<p>This example does bring up an interesting point though! Our examples so far have been simple values interpolated into the regex. In this case, we’re calling a method and it is still only being evaluated once. The operation you run in the interpolation is irrelevant - whatever is interpolated will never be run again with the <code>/o</code> modifier.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>If none of the other conditions are met, it means the interpolation is being evaluated by a different thread. All we can do here is wait to see what the value is.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the same concept as the threading example, but this is about the threads that lose the race. The most interesting part here is that it means this interpolation is guaranteed to be thread safe in CRuby (at least in the sense that other threads are locked out of it, not that you get a deterministic result). That will actually matter a little later, if you can believe it.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-it-exist">Why does it exist?</h3>
<p>I didn’t find a clear origin of this modifier. But it’s been around for 20+ years. It’s likely been around almost as long as Ruby itself. Matz, you scoundrel, you.</p>
<p>Shockingly, every other forum or blog post I found in relation to the <code>/o</code> modifier exclusively spoke about the performance benefits of it. I didn’t find any warnings at all. But mostly I found it used in a scripting context. In a single, simple script run, <em>maybe</em> you’re safe. But the downside seems way worse than any potential upside. If you really need a speed boost - just cache the regex yourself?</p>

</code></pre></div><p>The earliest reference I could find to the existence of a <code>/o</code> modifier in regex was in a <a href="https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=256053">2003 post on a <strong>Perl</strong> forum</a>. Based on this, I’m guessing Ruby borrowed it from Perl. Even in 2003, the prevailing wisdom was already clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best heuristic is: Never use <code>/o</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with that 2003 Perl person. You don’t need it. You should not use it. Step away from the modifier, and no one has to get hurt.</p>
<h3 id="ill-take-your-once-and-raise-you">I’ll take your <code>once</code>, and raise you…</h3>
<p>We’re all having fun here, right? Should we take this confounding modifier, and muddy things a bit more?</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> actually a way to force the <code>/o</code> modifier to re-evaluate.</p>
<p><em>hushed whispers!</em></p>
<p><em>someone in the back of the room faints!</em></p>
<p>I stumbled upon it because I was testing this code in a Rails console. I found that every time I called <code>reload!</code>, I was able to test my method from scratch again. Why would that be?</p>
<p>It’s because when you <code>reload!</code>, all of your code is re-evaluated by Ruby. And when it gets re-evaluated, you get new bytecode, and a new cache! Take this for instance:</p>
<pre><code>def one_time(input)
  /#{input}/o
end

p one_time(&#34;hi there!&#34;)

def one_time(input)
  /#{input}/o
end

p one_time(&#34;how are you?&#34;)
# /hi there!/
# /how are you?/
</code></pre>
<p>Even though we used the <code>/o</code> modifier, we were able to re-evaluate it. That’s because we overrode our <code>one_time</code> implementation, which gave us a new <code>once</code> cache.</p>
<p>This matters because it means you can’t even <em>truly</em> guarantee your <code>/o</code> regex will only be run once. If a piece of monkey patch code gets loaded and overrides your method, you will get even <em>more</em> non-deterministic behavior.</p>
<h3 id="the-inmates-are-running-the-asylum">The inmates are running the asylum</h3>
<p>In a moment of pure serendipity, the day after I started writing this post I happened to read Jared Norman’s <a href="https://jardo.dev/code-reloading-for-rack-apps">Code Reloading for Rack Apps</a>. The article teaches you how to build the same kind of code reloading Rails has, but in a standalone Rack application. You should give it a read.</p>
<p>In it, he creates a class called <code>Once</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This class let’s you create an object that encapsulates a bit of code and only ever lets it run once, even if it’s called across multiple threads.</p>

Makes sense!</p>
<p>As if I was destined to read this by some kind of trickster regex god, what did I see at the end of the article? A reimplementation of his <code>Once</code> class using the <code>/o</code> modifier!</p>
<p>A veritable devil on Jared’s shoulder, <a href="https://www.johnhawthorn.com/">John Hawthorne</a> gave him the idea. It would make sense that John, a Ruby internals wizard, would suggest such a thing. Then Jared, author of <a href="https://jardo.dev/advent-of-criminally-bad-ruby-code">Advent of Criminally Bad Ruby Code</a>, would actually decide to include it.</p>
<p>Here is their ingenious abomination.</p>
<pre><code>class Once
  def initialize(&amp;block)
    @block = block
  end

  def call
    /#{@block.call}/o # THE HORROR
  end
end

o = Once.new do
  puts &#34;I should only happen once&#34;
end

100.times.map { Thread.new { o.call } }.each(&amp;:join)
# =&gt; I should only happen once
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>/o</code>, the code examples still behave correctly and only run once despite the many threads attempting to run it.</p>
<p>It does, however, have a fatal flaw in comparison to the original code. Can you guess it?</p>
<p>Let’s demonstrate by creating multiple instances:</p>
<pre><code>o1 = Once.new { puts &#34;I should only happen once 1&#34; }
o2 = Once.new { puts &#34;I should only happen once 2&#34; }
o3 = Once.new { puts &#34;I should only happen once 3&#34; }

100.times.map { Thread.new { o1.call } }.each(&amp;:join)
100.times.map { Thread.new { o2.call } }.each(&amp;:join)
100.times.map { Thread.new { o3.call } }.each(&amp;:join)
</code></pre>
<p>In the original, mutex based implementation, we’d see the following:</p>
<pre><code># =&gt; I should only happen once 1
# =&gt; I should only happen once 2
# =&gt; I should only happen once 3
</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>/o</code> based implementation, we see this:</p>
<pre><code># =&gt; I should only happen once 1
</code></pre>
<p>Because of the instruction-level caching, we can only have <em>one</em> result from <code>Once#call</code>, <strong>ever</strong>. A class that literally can only be run reliably a <em>single</em> time. “Once”, indeed.</p>
<p>It’s probably more efficient than the mutex approach and <strong>maybe</strong> in some bizarro world where you truly needed a piece of code to be thread safe and lazy evaluated and as efficient up front as possible and only ever run once… maybe…</p>
<p>No… I cannot condone it - <strong><em>don’t do it!</em></strong></p>
<p>Side note: Jared also has an excellent podcast called <a href="https://shows.acast.com/dead-code">Dead Code</a>, with loads of episodes with fantastic guests. I went on to <a href="https://shows.acast.com/dead-code/episodes/violent-sleep-of-concurrency">speak about concurrency - give it a listen!</a></p>
<h3 id="this-is-the-end">This is the <code>END</code></h3>
<p>Earlier, I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is <code>once</code>? It can’t exist almost solely for the purposes of this extremely strange regex modifier, can it? Surely this modifier is not built into the very <em>bones</em> of Ruby?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the truth is, <code>/o</code> is not the <em>only</em> reason the <code>once</code> instruction exists. It took a little digging, but I found another piece of Ruby code that uses <code>once</code> - the <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/syntax/miscellaneous_rdoc.html#label-BEGIN+and+END"><code>END</code> language sytax</a>. I was surprised to find that <code>END</code> existed! I had never heard of it or used it before.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with the <code>end</code> keyword that closes out blocks, <code>END</code> defines a block that is run at the end of the Ruby program. For instance:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby"><span>END</span> { puts <span>&#34;do this last please&#34;</span> }
puts <span>&#34;1&#34;</span>
puts <span>&#34;2&#34;</span>
	
<span># =&gt; 1</span>
<span># =&gt; 2</span>
<span># =&gt; do this last please</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note that if you run this code in <code>irb</code>, the <code>END</code> block will not run until you exit. <code>irb</code> is just a Ruby program, and it doesn’t <code>END</code> until <code>irb</code> is exited.</p>
<p>If you disassemble this code, we’ll see a familiar instruction:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby">puts <span>RubyVM</span><span>::</span><span>InstructionSequence</span><span>.</span>compile(<span>DATA</span><span>.</span>read)<span>.</span>disassemble
	
<span>__END__
</span><span>END { puts &#34;do this last please&#34; }
</span><span>puts &#34;1&#34;
</span><span>puts &#34;2&#34;
</span><span>	
</span><span># == disasm: #&lt;ISeq:&lt;compiled&gt;@&lt;compiled&gt;:1 (1,0)-(4,8)&gt;
</span><span># 0000 once          block in &lt;compiled&gt;, &lt;is:0&gt;(   2)
</span></code></pre></div><p>So the <code>END</code> block, but not the <code>end</code> of a block, uses the <code>once</code> instruction, an instruction that is used twice in Ruby. An appropriately confusing close to an article about a fascinating feature I think you should never use - the <code>/o</code> modifier.</p>
