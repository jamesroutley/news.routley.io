  <li>really enjoyed chatting with @<strong>Jesse</strong> this morning. added some subreddits to my RSS feed (really love <a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/">Unread</a>, thank you so much for the rec @<strong>Daniel</strong>  – this is exactly what I’ve been looking for)</li>
  <li>caught up on more of the January Leetles (just 1 more I need to catch up on). it’s actually making leetcode kind of fun??</li>
  <li>got a really nice review on openwhen from @<strong>Marc Anthony</strong> and nice chats with @<strong>Kevin</strong> @<strong>Maura</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>generally took today slow because I had been grinding the past few days to publish v1 of <a href="https://www.openwhen.site/">openwhen</a>. also because this afternoon, i got rejected from the summer internship i was interviewing for and am bummed from that, was hoping i could be done with recruiting but i guess it wasn’t meant to be. perhaps something better will come along (“sometimes good things fall apart so that better things can come together” :vomit: hahaha). it’s also a bit destabilizing because i felt somewhat confident i’d get the role but i was wrong – and now, for grad school admissions I also feel somewhat confident i’ll get into at least one school and i might be wrong. and i know, i know, life is all about pivoting and making your next best move (“god laughs at plans” and “a tree that can never bend will break”) but like, i try <em>so</em> hard to go get the things i really want and i’m so tired of the universe saying nope nope nope :smiling_face_with_tear: but that’s not fair, it does say yes sometimes and that’s what i have to focus on otherwise i end up writing check-ins like this haha</p>
