    <h1>Hundreds of suicidal teens sleep in emergency rooms</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>On a rainy Thursday evening last spring, a 15-year-old girl was rushed by her parents to the emergency department at Boston Children’s Hospital. She had marks on both wrists from self-harm and a recent suicide attempt, and earlier that day she confided to her pediatrician that she planned to try again.</p><p>At the E.R., a doctor examined her and explained to her parents that she was not safe to go home.</p><p>“But I need to be honest with you about what’s likely to unfold,” the doctor added. The best place for adolescents in distress was not a hospital but an inpatient treatment center, where individual and group therapy would be provided in a calmer, communal setting, to stabilize the teens and ease them back to real life. But there were no openings in any of the treatment centers in the region, the doctor said.</p><p>Indeed, 15 other adolescents — all in precarious mental condition — were already housed in the hospital’s emergency department, sleeping in exam rooms night after night, waiting for an opening. The average wait for a spot in a treatment program was 10 days.</p></div></div><div><p>The girl and her family resigned themselves to a stay in the emergency room while she waited. But nearly a month went by before an inpatient bed opened up.</p></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/20/autossell/MIlly_CVR_FINAL_COLOR_v1/MIlly_CVR_FINAL_COLOR_v1-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span>Why are so many American teenagers feeling anxious, depressed and even suicidal?

Any equipment that might be used for harm had been removed. She was forbidden to use electronics — to keep her from searching the internet for ways to commit suicide or asking a friend to smuggle in a sharp object, as teens before her had done. Her door was kept open night and day so she could be monitored.</p><p>It was “padded, insane-asylum-like,” she recalled recently in an interview. “Just walls — all you see is walls.”</p><p>She grew “catatonic,” her mother recalled. “In this process of boarding we broke her worse than ever.”</p><p>Mental health disorders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/health/mental-health-crisis-teens.html" title="">are surging among adolescents</a>: <a href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/mchb/data-research/nsch-data-brief-2019-mental-bh.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In 2019, 13 percent of adolescents reported having a major depressive episode</a>, a 60 percent increase from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/12/a-growing-number-of-american-teenagers-particularly-girls-are-facing-depression/#:~:text=In%202017%2C%2013%25%20of%20U.S.,on%20Drug%20Use%20and%20Health." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2007</a>.

Across the country, hospital emergency departments have become boarding wards for teenagers who pose too great a risk to themselves or others to go home. They have nowhere else to go; even as the crisis has intensified, the medical system has failed to keep up, and options for inpatient and intensive outpatient psychiatric treatment have eroded sharply.</p><p>Nationally, the number of residential treatment facilities for people under the age of 18 fell to 592 in 2020 from 848 in 2012, a 30 percent decline, <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt35336/2020_NMHSS_final.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the most recent federal government survey.</a> The decline is partly a result of well-intentioned policy changes that did not foresee a surge in mental-health cases. Social-distancing rules and labor shortages during the pandemic have eliminated additional treatment centers and beds, experts say.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Dr. Kevin Carney, a pediatric emergency-room doctor at Childen’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora. “Frankly speaking, the E.D. is one of the worst places for a kid in mental health crisis to be,” he said.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">An exam room at Children’s Hospital Colorado, where fixtures and other items had been removed to prevent harm.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>Absent that option, emergency rooms have taken up the slack. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2786569" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A recent study </a>of 88 pediatric hospitals around the country found that 87 of them regularly board children and adolescents overnight in the E.R. On average, any given hospital saw four boarders per day, with an average stay of 48 hours.</p><p>“There is a pediatric pandemic of mental health boarding,” said Dr. JoAnna K. Leyenaar, a pediatrician at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and the study’s lead author. In an interview, she extrapolated from her research and other data to estimate that at least 1,000 young people, and perhaps as many as 5,000, board each night in the nation’s 4,000 emergency departments.</p><p>“We have a national crisis,” Dr. Leyenaar said.</p><p>This trend runs far afoul of the recommended best practices established by the Joint Commission, a nonprofit organization that helps set national health care policy. According to the standard, adolescents who come to the E.R. for mental health reasons should stay there no longer than four hours, as an extended stay can risk patient safety, delay treatment and divert resources from other emergencies.</p><p>Yet in 2021, the average adolescent boarding in the E.R. at Boston Children’s Hospital spent nine days waiting for an inpatient bed, up from three and a half days in 2019; at Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora in 2021, the average wait was eight days, and at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center in Hartford, it was six.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong><em>Read below about how Matt Richtel </em></strong><strong><a href="#23adolescents-methodology-box" title=""><em>reported this series</em></a></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p>Emergency-department boarding has risen at small, rural hospitals, too, with “no pediatric or mental health<strong> </strong>specialists,” said Dr. Christian Pulcini, a pediatrician in Vermont who has <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acem.14509" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studied</a> the trend in the state. “There is one clear conclusion,” he told the Vermont legislature recently. “The E.D. is not the appropriate setting for children to get comprehensive, acute mental health services.”</p><p>Doctors and hospital officials emphasize that adolescents should absolutely continue to come to the E.R. in a psychiatric emergency. Still, many emergency-room doctors and nurses, trained to treat broken bones, pneumonia and other corporeal challenges, said aid the ideal solution was more preventive care and community treatment programs.</p><p>“Frankly speaking, the E.D. is one of the worst places for a kid in mental health crisis to be,” said Dr. Kevin Carney, a pediatric emergency room doctor at Children’s Hospital Colorado. “I feel at a loss for how to help these kids.”</p><h2 id="link-61039d5a">‘Actually a good day’</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/02/science/00ADOLESCENT-EMERGENCY-carney1/00ADOLESCENT-EMERGENCY-carney1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/02/science/00ADOLESCENT-EMERGENCY-carney1/00ADOLESCENT-EMERGENCY-carney1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/02/science/00ADOLESCENT-EMERGENCY-carney1/00ADOLESCENT-EMERGENCY-carney1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Dr. Carney on his rounds at Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora last month." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/02/science/00ADOLESCENT-EMERGENCY-carney1/merlin_206240934_08fb39c3-ddd3-477b-838d-2a83bbc807d5-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/02/science/00ADOLESCENT-EMERGENCY-carney1/merlin_206240934_08fb39c3-ddd3-477b-838d-2a83bbc807d5-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/02/science/00ADOLESCENT-EMERGENCY-carney1/merlin_206240934_08fb39c3-ddd3-477b-838d-2a83bbc807d5-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/02/science/00ADOLESCENT-EMERGENCY-carney1/merlin_206240934_08fb39c3-ddd3-477b-838d-2a83bbc807d5-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Dr. Carney on his rounds at Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora last month.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>The challenge was evident one day in late February when Dr. Carney arrived for his shift at 3 p.m. The children’s hospital has 50 exam rooms in its emergency department, which fill with patients who have gone through an initial screening and need further evaluation. By midafternoon, 43 of the rooms were full, 17 of them with mental health cases.</p><p>“It’s breathtaking,” Dr. Carney said as he stood in the hallway. “Forty percent.”</p><p>On clocking in, Dr. Carney had inherited a block of 10 exam rooms from a doctor who was clocking out. “Seven are mental health issues,” Dr. Carney said. “Six are suicidal. Three of them made attempts.”</p><p>The adolescents who were deemed to be at physical risk to themselves or others could be readily identified: Their exam room doors were open so they could be monitored, and they wore maroon-colored scrubs instead of their own clothes. No shoelaces, belts or zippers.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Throughout the day, staff members at the hospital had called eight inpatient facilities in the region, looking for available slots in treatment centers where the 10 young boarders, as well as 17 other adolescents boarding at three smaller Colorado Children’s Hospital campuses around the state, could be placed.</p><p>One of the adolescents waiting in Aurora, a Denver suburb, was a 16-year-old who had been stabilized after attempting suicide and who needed a residential treatment spot. “But there are no beds,” Jessica Friedman, a social worker, said she had told the family.</p><p>“I have eight or nine conversations like this a day,” Ms. Friedman, standing in the hallway, told a reporter; so far that day she had had only two. “This is actually a good day.”</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Jessica Friedman, a social worker at Children’s Hospital Colorado.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">A room at the Gary Pavilion Pediatric Mental Health Institute at Children’s Hospital in Aurora, Colo., one of eight inpatient facilities in the area.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>Standing nearby, Travis Justilian, a nurse and the interim clinic manager in the emergency department, said the flood of boarders “is crushing our staff.” He added, “We’re fixers and we’re sitting here doing nothing but watching them watch TV.”</p><p>Colorado is struggling with the same shortage of services that has hit hospitals nationwide. The state has lost 1,000 residential beds serving various adolescent populations since 2012, according to Heidi Baskfield, vice president of population health and advocacy for Children’s Hospital Colorado. The state closed one 500-bed facility, Ridgeview, which served at-risk young people, in 2021 <a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/06/30/ridge-view-youth-services-closes-violations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">because of instances of poor quality and abuse</a>. Another facility, <a href="http://www.excelsiorcares.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Excelsior</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/8c4d9f0749ecc1d17ad7ed00b9a2e594" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed its 200 beds in 2017</a> because reimbursement rates were not high enough to support ongoing operations, the chief executive officer said at the time of the closing.</p><p>A major cause, Ms. Baskfield said, was the low reimbursement rates paid by Medicaid, the state insurance program. From 2006 to 2021, the daily Medicaid rate in Colorado allotted roughly $400 for a therapeutic residential bed — “less than some families spend to send their kids for a night to sleepaway camp,” Ms. Baskfield said.</p></div></div><div><p>The low rates also accounted for some of the quality issues, she said; it was hard to hire experienced staff. (In the past year, Colorado has raised its reimbursement to $750 per day by using money from the American Rescue Plan, but new beds have yet to open, and that source of money is temporary).</p></div><div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Travis Justilian, a nurse and interim clinic manager in the emergency department. “We’re fixers and we’re sitting here doing nothing but watching them watch TV,” he said.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Lyndsay Gaffey, the hospital’s director of patient care services.

But the intended substitutes — more nimble and specialized treatment options — were never funded and remain largely unavailable, she said.</p><p>Then came the pandemic, amplifying labor shortages and introducing social-distancing and quarantine guidelines that reduced the capacity for patients. “Demand went up, supply went down,” Ms. Burton said. “Now we’re in full-blown crisis.”</p><p>On that February day in Colorado, one inpatient bed finally opened up. It happened to be in the 12-bed inpatient ward of Children’s Hospital Colorado,just a few minutes’ walk from the E.R.</p><p>The ward’s hallways are wide, the walls painted light green and the lighting bright, to instill a feeling of comfort and calm. Each bedroom has windows looking outside and, next to the door, a glass panel enabling hospital staff to discreetly peer inside.</p><p>In a small communal room, four adolescent girls in maroon scrubs sat on blue chairs and couches. One listened to headphones and sang aloud to the soundtrack to “Encanto.” Another worked on a jigsaw puzzle of the sea. Two others chatted with a counselor.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The emergency department “is just a collection of rooms where patients are expected to stay in their rooms and comply with rules,” said Lyndsay Gaffey, director of patient care services at Children’s Hospital Colorado. In the inpatient ward, she said, the aim instead was to stabilize patients by having them work through trauma, receive therapy and interact with peers.</p><p>But they must be closely watched here, too. When a reporter rested a pen on a countertop, a staff member swept it up. “You cannot have this here unless it is on your person,” she said. “If a patient walks over and grabs it, it can basically be used as a weapon.”</p><h2 id="link-7f746993">Is it safe to go home?</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">J on a neighborhood street in Denver last month.

Often, parents opt to return home with their child, to try to manage there while waiting for a treatment opening. But that option requires family and doctors alike to work through a difficult question: Is the adolescent safe to go home?</p><p>In early February, a 12-year-old boy, J, was struggling toward an answer at the emergency room of the Highlands Ranch campus of Children’s Hospital Colorado. (He is being identified by his first initial for privacy reasons.)</p><p>He had arrived that morning with his mother, after she discovered that he had been searching the internet for ways to commit suicide. Over the course of his day in the E.R., he was asked several times how safe he felt to go home. The mother recounted one exchange:</p><p>“Do you think you can go home?” the doctor asked.</p><p>“What’s the other option?” J asked.</p><p>“You’d be in the emergency room.”</p><p>“I can go home with my mom,” J said. “But if I feel like I’m going to kill myself, what do I do?’”</p><p>“You’ll come back to the emergency room,” the doctor replied.</p></div></div><div><div><p>J’s mother took him home and “hid every medicine and every knife,” she said. J wanted to get help and asked her that first night: “So can I start tomorrow?”</p><section role="complementary" aria-label="How to Help Teens Struggling With Mental Health"><h2>How to Help Teens Struggling With Mental Health</h2><hr/><div id="storyline-context-container" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><p><span>Card 1 of 6</span></p><div data-scrolled-index="0"><div aria-hidden="false"><p><strong>Recognize the signs.<!-- --> </strong><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/well/family/teen-anxiety-myths.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-mental-health-package&amp;variant=show&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc">Anxiety</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/magazine/mental-health-crisis-kids.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-mental-health-package&amp;variant=show&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc">depression</a> are different issues but they do share some indicators.

The family has a history of anxiety and depression, the mother said, but G had been a happy and adventurous child. In middle school she started talking back and acting somewhat obsessively, behavior that her mother figured was typical for a teenager.</p><p>What G’s mother did not know was that her daughter had been cutting herself for two years, since seventh grade, before the pandemic began. “I cut with literally anything I could find — hockey cards, pipe cleaners, paper clips, anything,” G said. She described the self-harm as a “coping mechanism” to deal with inner pain. She hid the activity “with sweaters, hoodies, foundation.”</p><p>As the pandemic set in, G withdrew, and her grades fell. “Then came April 29,” her mother said. “We had a life before April 29 and a life after April 29.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>That day, she picked up G at school for a routine visit to the pediatrician. As G got into the car, her mother saw the marks on her wrists.</p><p>At the emergency room, G told the medical team she had tried to overdose a few weeks earlier and had regretted the next morning that she was still alive. In the exam room, she noticed a container of hand sanitizer. “I told them, ‘I’m thinking about drinking this,’” G recalled.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Boston Children’s Hospital.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>Admitting to her pain and self-harm provided her “with kind of a little bit of relief,” she said. “After two years of cutting and trying to kill myself, I was finally going to get some help. But I didn’t really get help.”</p><p>That first night, she was moved for safety reasons to a room that contained just a bed and, for her mother, a rollaway. With the door open, sleeping was difficult. “A sitter was literally staring at my kid,” G’s mother said. “It felt demoralizing.”</p><p>Mother and daughter played Uno, Go Fish, checkers and Connect Four.

	<span data-id="1"><strong>How Matt Richtel spoke to adolescents and their parents for this series</strong></span>
</h2>
<p>
	In mid-April, I was speaking to the mother of a suicidal teenager whose struggles I’ve been closely following. I asked how her daughter was doing.
</p>
<p>
	Not well, the mother said: “If we can’t find something drastic to help this kid, this kid will not be here long term.” She started to cry. “It’s out of our hands, it’s out of our control,” she said. “We’re trying everything.”
</p>
<p>
	She added: “It’s like waiting for the end.”
</p>
<p>
	Over nearly 18 months of reporting, I got to know many adolescents and their families and interviewed dozens of doctors, therapists and experts in the science of adolescence. I heard wrenching stories of pain and uncertainty. From the outset, my editors and I discussed how best to handle the identities of people in crisis.
</p>
<p>
	The Times sets a high bar for granting sources anonymity; our stylebook calls it “a last resort” for situations where important information can’t be published any other way. Often, the sources might face a threat to their career or even their safety, whether from a vindictive boss or a hostile government.
</p>
<p>
	In this case, the need for anonymity had a different imperative: to protect the privacy of young, vulnerable adolescents. They have harmed themselves and attempted suicide, and some have threatened to try again. In recounting their stories, we had to be mindful that our first duty was to their safety.
</p>
<p>
	If The Times published the names of these adolescents, they could be easily identified years later. Would that harm their employment opportunities? Would a teen — a legal minor — later regret having exposed his or her identity during a period of pain and struggle? Would seeing the story published amplify ongoing crises?
</p>
<p>
	As a result, some teenagers are identified by first initial only; some of their parents are identified by first name or initial. Over months, I got to know M, J and C, and in Kentucky, I came to know struggling adolescents I identified only by their ages, 12, 13 and 15. In some stories, we did not publish precisely where the families lived.
</p>
<p>
	Everyone I interviewed gave their own consent, and parents were typically present for the interviews with their adolescents. On a few occasions, a parent offered to leave the room, or an adolescent asked for privacy and the parent agreed.
</p>
<p>
	In these articles, I heard grief, confusion and a desperate search for answers. The voices of adolescents and their parents, while shielded by anonymity, deepen an understanding of this mental health crisis.
