    <h1>Keeping your data from Apple is harder than expected</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
                    <div><h2><strong>Participants weren’t able to stop data sharing in any of the apps</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">In practice, protecting privacy on an Apple device requires persistent and expert clicking on each app individually. Apple&#39;s help falls short.</p>
<p dir="ltr">‘The online instructions for restricting data access are very complex and confusing, and the steps required are scattered in different places. There’s no clear direction on whether to go to the app settings, the central settings – or even both,’ says <strong>Amel Bourdoucen</strong>, a doctoral researcher at Aalto.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition, the instructions didn’t list all the necessary steps or explain how collected data is processed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The researchers also demonstrated these problems experimentally. They interviewed users and asked them to try changing the settings. </p>
<p dir="ltr">‘It turned out that the participants weren’t able to prevent any of the apps from sharing their data with other applications or the service provider,’ Bourdoucen says. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Finding and adjusting privacy settings also took a lot of time. ‘When making adjustments, users don&#39;t get feedback on whether they’ve succeeded. They then get lost along the way, go backwards in the process and scroll randomly, not knowing if they&#39;ve done enough,’ Bourdoucen says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the end, Bourdoucen explains, the participants were able to take one or two steps in the right direction, but none succeeded in following the whole procedure to protect their privacy.</p>
<h2><strong>Running out of options</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">If preventing data sharing is difficult, what does Apple do with all that data? </p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s not possible to be sure based on public documents, but Lindqvist says it’s possible to conclude that the data will be used to train the artificial intelligence system behind Siri and to provide personalised user experiences, among other things. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Many users are used to seamless multi-device interaction, which makes it difficult to move back to a time of more limited data sharing. However, Apple could inform users much more clearly than it does today, says Lindqvist. The study lists a number of detailed suggestions to clarify privacy settings and improve guidelines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For individual apps, Lindqvist says that the problem can be solved to some extent by opting for a third-party service. For example, some participants in the study had switched from Safari to Firefox.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lindqvist can’t comment directly on how Google&#39;s Android works in similar respects, as no one has yet done a similar mapping of its apps. But past research on third-party apps does not suggest that Google is any more privacy-conscious than Apple.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So what can be learned from all this – are users ultimately facing an almost impossible task?</p>
<p dir="ltr">‘Unfortunately, that&#39;s one lesson,’ says Lindqvist.</p></div>
