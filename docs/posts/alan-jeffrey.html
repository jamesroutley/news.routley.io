        <p>I want to wrap up 2024 by talking about my friend <a href="https://asaj.org/">Alan Jeffrey</a>, who we lost this year.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure I met Alan at the first academic conference I ever attended, which was <a href="https://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2010/">ICFP 2010</a>, but he was a regular in that community for decades before that. Other people of course knew him far longer, and far better, than I did. <a href="https://patternsinfp.wordpress.com/2024/11/05/alan-jeffrey-1967-2024/">Jeremy Gibbons’ lovely eulogy</a>, which he gave at Alan’s Celebration of Life in November, highlights the incredible breadth and depth of Alan’s career and makes me wish I had another twenty years to talk shop with him. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SojRIt_oljE&amp;t=916s">Robby Findler’s</a> remembrance of Alan, which he shared at ICFP 2024 a few months after Alan passed away in July, also touched me deeply.</p>

<p>Robby and Jeremy represent a community for which Alan’s passing is a tremendous loss.  But one thing that has really amazed me over the last year has been to see <em>how many</em> communities Alan was part of, and the incredible number and variety of lives he touched.  When his health took a turn for the worse this spring, I exchanged emails and Signal messages about Alan with people who I know in completely different contexts – people who don’t know each other, but who had in common a connection to Alan, and who thought fondly of him. Academics; open source software folks; people considerably older or younger than me – he was part of all of their worlds.</p>

<p>While I was never fortunate enough to collaborate on research with Alan, a project we did do together was organizing captioning of all the <a href="https://icfp20.sigplan.org/">ICFP 2020</a> and <a href="https://icfp21.sigplan.org/">2021</a> talks – the main thing I’m proud of from my time on the ICFP organizing committee in those years. Captions make conference talks better for everyone. They’re crucial to accessibility for Deaf and hard of hearing people (as well as people who might have some degree of hearing loss but don’t identify as hard of hearing or deaf), non-native speakers of the language being used (a large fraction of the ICFP community), and folks with auditory processing issues or ADHD. Last but not least, they provide a useful <a href="https://github.com/lkuper/icfp2020-captions">searchable text record</a> of talk content.</p>

<p>In 2020, we were able to hire a professional to caption all the talks, but the professional captions we were able to get were often wrong.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Alan then personally went through a large number of the talks and made corrections in places where the professional captioner got a piece of jargon wrong, lacked context for what was going on, or didn’t understand a speaker’s accent.  I corrected some of the talks myself as well, but Alan did many more of them. You need only look at a few of <a href="https://github.com/lkuper/icfp2020-captions/commits/master/?author=ajeffrey@mozilla.com">Alan’s commits</a> to witness his painstaking attention to detail and vast domain expertise at work. After our correction pass, we also organized a process by which the speakers themselves could submit corrections to their captions, which caught further issues that Alan and I missed. I’m happy to say that in the end, the 2020 captions were high quality, and we did it again in 2021. Automatic speech-to-text tools just weren’t good enough.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Last fall, as Alan’s health began to fail, he began <a href="https://mastodon.scot/@asaj/111137243172893329">having trouble understanding spoken language</a>, although reading wasn’t a problem. This would of course be terrifying for most of us. But Alan had a typically laid-back attitude about it and he mentioned that <a href="https://types.pl/@asaj/111148776556744244">he himself could now unexpectedly benefit from the work he’d done a few years earlier</a> on captions.</p>

<p>(Am I politicizing Alan’s illness and death right now to argue for better accessibility affordances at conferences, more empathy for our colleagues who need them, and less dependence on unreliable AI tools?  You’re goddamn fucking right I am.)</p>

<p>In general, whatever life threw at Alan, whether it was serious health issues (he also had MS) or ill-conceived corporate layoffs (he was part of the amazing <a href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a> team that Mozilla gave the boot to in 2020), he somehow always handled it with serenity<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and found the positive side of every situation.  He seemed to enjoy every day he was alive. He posted frequent smiling <a href="https://mastodon.scot/@asaj/111750522249618195">selfies</a> and was <a href="https://mastodon.scot/@asaj/111499708398124664">happy to have outlived Henry Kissinger</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SojRIt_oljE&amp;t=1415s">Robby said</a> that Alan had not only “syntactic serenity” – the shallow kind that has become a meme – but “semantic serenity, a deep sense of joy and acceptance of whatever it was that was there in front of him” – and I can’t think of a more fitting way to describe Alan.</p>

<p>In 2025 and beyond, may we all remember Alan fondly and try to live up to his example.</p>
