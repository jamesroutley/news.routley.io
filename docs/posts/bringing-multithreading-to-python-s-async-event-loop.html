    <h1>Show HN: Bringing multithreading to Python&#39;s async event loop</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">This is an attempt at building an asyncio compatible event loop that is multithreaded. I.e. you will finally be able to use asyncio and actually have it be multithreaded !
I&#39;ve written a <a href="https://www.neilbotelho.com/blog/multithreaded-async.html" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> explaining more about the why and how of this project.</p>

<p dir="auto">The goal here isnâ€™t to create a production-ready or high-performance multithreaded alternative to asyncio. This is just a chance to explore the idea, share what I learn, and get a basic FastAPI server running with this multithreaded async setup.</p>

<p dir="auto">The only thing you&#39;ll need is the free threaded Python 3.13 release. I recommend using pyenv to get it.</p>

<p dir="auto">Then you can just install this package by running the following from the top level of the git repo:</p>


<p dir="auto">I have a couple of scripts in the tests folder that you can use to test out basic functionality as well as a basic fastapi server.
Feel free to submit more interesting tests as PR&#39;s and open issues that you come across. I won&#39;t commit to fixing them, but it&#39;ll be useful to others looking at this.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>tests/basic.py</code> : contains a simple async function, with sleeping and <code>asyncio.gather</code></li>
<li><code>tests/get_request.py</code> : contains an example async GET request with <code>httpx</code></li>
<li><code>tests/listen.py</code> : contains sample code for listening for incoming connections in an async manner</li>
</ul>
