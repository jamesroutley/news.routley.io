This is a museum of accidental art, an enthusiastic embrace of mistakes, a celebration of emergent beauty. <a href="https://glitchgallery.org/about/">Learn more?</a></p>
<p>Below you can browse the exhibits in our collection. Keep scrolling down to see them in more detail! If you have ever encountered such an accidental artwork yourself, we <strong>invite you to <a href="https://glitchgallery.org/submit/">submit it to us</a>!</strong></p>
</div><div><div><div><div><p>Because of the pandemic, the exam for the course Realtime Computer Graphics was transformed into a large assignment that had to be done at home. For this assignment we had to implement multiple typical shaders in vulkan. One of those was the cubemap, for pointlight shadows.</p>

<p>When calculating shadows, you typically calculate the nearest object to a lightsource and map this onto a shadowmap. When calculating the real image you check the distance from the rendered object to the light and then check with the shadowmap, whether your distance is larger. If yes, your object is in shadow.</p>

<p>When creating a cubemap you have to create six images and put them into an array and then define that array as a cubemap via some imageview. The problem here was, that the documentation for vulkan didnt clearly say, which part of the array was responsible for which part of the cube. Therefore I had to manually try out all the different possibilities. To make this easier on me I mapped the location of the object that was seen onto my cubemap and then used this position as the color, that was rendered. With this it was easier to find out which part of the cube was mapped where.</p>

Photoshop, the program crashed and generated this corrupted file. I’m
unable to open it back up in Adobe, but the results are really
exciting and fractalized.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/itch/itch.jpg"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/itch/itch.jpg"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>I was trying to make a game with isometric graphics. While working on the
engine, I accidentally mixed the loading and update functions. This made the
game create a new group of tiles every time a rotation event was triggered,
resulting in this 3D perspective.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>I tried to create packed circles chart, but neglected to summarize the data first. I forgot I had orange labeling turned on for some points, so all 4300+ dots are shown with the same size and and 700 colliding labels. This happened when using the <a href="https://jmp.com" target="_blank">JMP</a> statistical visualization software on a data table of Mastodon instance domain names.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/orange-shift/orange-shift.png"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/orange-shift/orange-shift.png"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>I was trying to code a 10PRINT program but I ended up with this weird thing.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/1print/1print.gif"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/1print/1print.gif"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>I was experimenting with digital TV reception with a cheap DVB-T stick if I remember correctly, and EyeTV. At some point I managed to detune and wiggle the antenna just right to get some great glitches. This one stuck out to me especially because the image quality itself is very soft but the glitch artifacts are sharp. Paired with the warm colors this looked so intentional to me that I had to save the capture.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/behind-bars/behind-bars.jpg"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/behind-bars/behind-bars.jpg"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>Through a yet unknown mechanism during loading data iOS’s photos app decided to replace all photo thumbnails in year view with either light grey or black squares. The distribution paired with the number of pictures in each year of my photo library from 2007 to 2014 made it appear like a digital void infecting the past and slowly devouring the future, ever growing in the process.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/void-of-the-future/void-of-the-future.png"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/void-of-the-future/void-of-the-future.png"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>After teaching myself the Go programming language in the year prior, I thought
it would be cool to make something with OpenGL. I started out with a nice
sphere by tessellating an icosahedron. That worked well. An then I wanted to
make it better by using vertex indices… Which produced this furry ball.</p>

<p>What went wrong? I pondered and tried a few things for a whole day. And then I
remembered that one time I read the Go language spec, specifically the part
where it states that <code>int</code>, the data type that I was using for my indices was
either 32 or 64 bits wide depending on the target architecture. Of course I had
assumed it was 32 bits the whole time. This caused OpenGL to treat a single
index of 64 bits as two 32 bit indices.</p>

<p>This incident was also used in an
<a href="https://polyfloyd.net/post/golang-subtle-pitfalls/" target="_blank">article</a> about Go I wrote.</p>
</div></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/how-big-is-an-int/how-big-is-an-int.png"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/how-big-is-an-int/how-big-is-an-int.png"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>This happened when I was experimenting with a combination of 3D rendering and Slit Scanning. My goal was to create smooth surreally warping shapes by re-mapping the x-axis to the time axis and the time axis to the x-axis. Unfortunately I found out the hard way that when you do not randomize everything properly Blender animations rendered in Cycles will have nearly the same image noise in subsequent frames. Since time is represented on the x-axis in my video result this ended up having very long horizontal stripes of noise.</p>

<p>For this experiment I rendered a scene in Blender and used a Processing Sketch I previously created that takes each frame of a video, cuts the same column of pixels out of each of the frames and combines all the pixel columns into a new image that is as many pixels wide as the original video had frames. Multiply that times as many pixel columns as the original video has to create a new set of frames for the resulting animation.</p>
</div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>It was supposed to become a text editor or something, but primarily I
just wanted to make the smallest bitmap font I could manage and draw it
on screen. After the simple solution (<code>glDrawPixels()</code>) exposed a driver
bug (underused code path), this was supposed to be the “proper” version
using textured quads. Obviously, the vertices got scrambled somehow.</p>

<p>The project ended up on the <em>infinite shelf</em> shortly after I had fixed
the issue, so this glitch piece remains its only notable result. :)</p>

<p>Materials used: Haskell, OpenGL</p>

</div></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/fontgedoens/salat.png"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/fontgedoens/salat.png"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>I was attempting to create a node that would repeatedly save the last 100 positions of a given function, traced out in green dots here. Unfortunately, instead of saving into the very last spot in the array, it saved into the second-to-last spot in the array, creating an interesting gap and teleporting lines whenever a new position was saved. It’s always a shame when your creations accidentally learn to artistically teleport.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>While animating a transition in some animation software (After Effects or Apple Motion) I accidentally deleted my asset which was a transparent pixel graphic of a red letter “x”. All instances of my “x” got immediately replaced by black squares. Unfortunately I forgot why my background was a tilted checkerboard pattern in this screenshot. In any event, the mistake resulted in something I found deeply pleasing on a visual level, which is why I snapped a screenshot of the scene before undoing my mistake and continuing the actual animation.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/crumbling-giant/crumbling-giant.png"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/crumbling-giant/crumbling-giant.png"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>We wrote a raytracer in university and I made a mistake when calculating the angle between the ray and the object that got hit.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/hard-steps/raytracer.png"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/hard-steps/raytracer.png"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>I wanted to test the creation of random Béziercurves and accidentally drew the control points of all curves instead of only the last one. This resulted in a picture that kinda looks like a Jackson Pollock painting.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/bezier-pollock/pollock.png"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/bezier-pollock/pollock.png"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>While playing around with a fractal generator that generates Flames I stumbled across this beautiful pattern by randomizing certain parameters.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/dishes/dishes.jpg"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/dishes/dishes.jpg"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>I was writing some custom voronoi shaders in glsl where I can dynamically change the number of moving cells and their colors. I’m actually still not sure what caused this bug but it had to do with going over the max number of cells that my shader allowed.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>An unexpected error was encountered during an experiment with OpenCV and Python while looking for new
ways to create algorithmic artwork.  A collection of randomly selected historical artworks was provided
as input, and the objective was to merge these images and apply a visual effect to make the output look
more like an oil painting. While the function for creating the oil painting effect was running, some type
of memory error was encountered, therefore causing only a small part of the input image set to be
processed, leaving a fraction of what would have been the final product.  The green and black colors
present a palette like a shard from a broken motherboard, which seems appropriate given the context for
this failed trial run.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/empty-set/empty-set.jpg"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/empty-set/empty-set.jpg"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>The artist was trying to hack together a simple solution for a programming exercise: Making a Sierpinski triangle in Python with the Turtle Module. They missed one line of code, and it took some time to find the problem. The exact problem is a missing turn at the end of each cycle.</p>

<p>You can find the exercise (all in German), as well as other recursion exercises, <a href="https://www.inf-schule.de/algorithmen/rekursivealgorithmen/selbstaehnlichkeit/uebungen" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

called <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sHfRn5Y0YKYKi1k-ifUSBFRNJ8_1sa39" target="_blank">Disco Diffusion</a>,
I tried to get rid of some elements, which I thought were wind turbines.
Using a negative weight turned out to have a very large, unintended effect.</p>

<p>The full text prompt was: “A windy coast on a cloudy day, by Caspar
Friedrich and Albert Bierstadt, featured on ArtStation:5”, “turbines,
towers:-10”</p>

<p>I enabled the RN50x16 model - everything else used the 4.1
default settings.</p>

While processing the images, the app crashed and left me this wonderful piece on my phone.</p>

<p>I have no idea what exactly happened here, but it seems to have combined two of the images during the compression process.</p>

Instead, this little face appeared to mock his attempts.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>I was trying to render font tests: “SPHINX OF BLACK QUARTZ HEED MY VOW” and “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”. The characters are all positioned correctly, but due to swapping rows and columns, they’re all mirrored and rotated 90 degrees and kind of squished together.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/glyphs/glyphs.png"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/glyphs/glyphs.png"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>This glitch happened to me in the class “recreating the past” by Zach Lieberman at the School for Poetic Computation in 2019. We were supposed to recreate one of John Maeda’s posters of the Morisawa 10 series. I tried to implement it in poststcript but could not figure out where the word was landing on the paper as</p>

<ul>
  <li>all the measurements were relative and</li>
  <li>in an unknown scale and</li>
  <li>postscript is stack based and</li>
  <li>the order of operators is really peculiar, so I tried to mark the boundary box in red.</li>
</ul>
</div></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/morisawa-error/morisawa-error.svg"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/morisawa-error/morisawa-error.svg"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>I am currently implementing a simple OpenGL renderer in Rust as a hobby project to get more familiar with graphics and the language. Somehow my specular lighting didn’t seem to work properly and in debugging I decided to visualize the view-vector, using it as the fragment color.</p>

<p>The expected result was seeing the same colors no matter where I moved, as the vector is location dependent… turns out I completely forgot to set the uniform variable of the camera position, so my shader was reading zeroed out memory and I effectively colored my scene with the fragment positions. Turns out this looks a lot prettier than the (by now…) working shading :) Gives me a bit of a dreamy-trippy feeling.</p>
</div></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/viewscape/viewscape.png"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/viewscape/viewscape.png"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>The default GNOME desktop background (Adwaita theme, Jakub Steiner, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>) got corrupted somehow – initially with abstract blocky patterns; later, snippets of other things that had been shown on my screen and (apparently) other random graphics-related memory (some font tables?) started to be included, too.</p>

<p>The glitch is, when it happens, remarkably stable. The background does not flicker, and switching to a different background and then back to the default preserves all the artifacts as well. Sometimes GNOME switches from the “day” to the “night” variant of the background, creating a new variant of the glitch in the process (the “night” variant seems to leave more of the artifacts visible) – compare images 1 &amp; 2 or 4 &amp; 5.</p>

<p>Since this bug reappears a few times a month, this is a series which will continue to receive updates – until the GNOME bug that presumably causes it is fixed, I suppose.</p>

Unfortunately, the global voxelization data structure could only be used by a single camera, required recomputation upon camera movement, resulted in flickering artefacts due to realigning the regular grid with the camera’s changing coordinate system, and resulted in cracks and empty voxels at some camera angles due to the difficulty of conservative voxelization using a non-conservative rasterization pipeline.</p>

<p>The video marked the end of camera space computations and data structures in <a href="https://github.com/matt77hias/MAGE" target="_blank">MAGE</a>, which now uses the more convenient, stable and camera-invariant <a href="https://matt77hias.github.io/res/Publications/Moulin2019-1/Publication.html" target="_blank">world-space</a>.</p>
</div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>I accidentally dragged a material used for drawing text into the slot for the leaf material on this tree.
That caused the flat planes that were supposed to be used for leaves to have letters instead. Because this is an LOD group (multiple meshes are drawn on top of each other, with varying level of detail), leaves are still visible from the other trees in the group.</p>

<p>Additionally, the leaf meshes have vertex color – there is color information kept in the actual mesh itself independent of any material. That color is not meant to be seen as a color, it is actually used as an xyz value for determining wind animation, but the text material applies vertex color on the assumption that it is attached to actual text and vertex color is text color set by the user. This is what caused the text to have the nice gradient seen here.</p>

One of the first tasks was to load glTF files with 3d models. Actually, this image should display a yellow rubber duck. Instead, it turned out to be a colorful gem. I am not completely sure what went wrong but my guess is that I accidentally interpreted the normal buffer as the position buffer. With increasing complexity of the loaded model, the displayed object looked more and more like a sphere.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/gemstone/gemstone.png"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/gemstone/gemstone.png"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>During the development of a visualizer tool for an academic paper I was writing at the time (<a href="http://graphics.cs.kuleuven.be/publications/BLD13OCCSVO/" target="_blank"><em>Out Of Core Construction Of Sparse Voxel Octrees</em> by J. Baert, A. Lagae &amp; P. Dutré</a>), I made an error in the code that descends into the hierarchical voxel structure we saved our models in, resulting in a render that not only omitted 80% of the voxelized triangle faces, but also did a hard cutoff of the normal information that was stored with them, resulting in this weird glitchy noir-ish classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_bunny" target="_blank">Stanford Bunny</a>. You’re seeing triangles which are actually built up from tiny voxels, in a 1024 x 1024 x 1024 voxel grid.</p>

<p>The renderer was a CPU-based raytracer that used OpenGL to display the final result in a screen-filling quad at a resolution of 512 x 512. Thanks to the inherently parallelizable nature of the raytracing algorithm I could slap OpenMP on it and get it to run at interactive speeds, whilst loading all university-provided cores at 100%, naturally.</p>

The function is calculated in part by multiplying the 4x1 error vector e(t) and 4x4 matrix P together as e(t)’<em>P</em>e(t) (apostrophe is the transpose), which produces a scalar. In addition to some other problems, instead of assigning e(t) to the error vector at time t, I assigned error at <em>every timestep</em> to e, resulting in a 4x4000 matrix. As a result, plotting v(t) shows 4000 different signals that result from mixing error values from different timesteps. Since e at consecutive timesteps are relatively evenly spaced, the curves plotted are also evenly spaced aesthetically in a way that reminds me of glassblowing or squids swimming mid-stroke.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/squid/squid.png"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/squid/squid.png"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>During <a href="http://charstiles.com/learn-livecoding-shaders/" target="_blank">Char’s shaders workshop</a>, I accidentally left an infinite loop in my vertex shader. Since KodeLife is constantly recompiling and running your program, infinite loops can cause the entire IDE to crash. The resulting canvas visualizes whatever data happened to be in the GPU registers from KodeLife’s final moment.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/moment-before-the-infinite-loop/moment-before-the-infinite-loop.jpg"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/moment-before-the-infinite-loop/moment-before-the-infinite-loop.jpg"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>Writing an OpenGL game for a game jam, this was our first attempt to render to an offscreen framebuffer object. However, we had forgotten to re-bind the textures in our main loop, and now the active texture contained the framebuffer data. This meant that every textured object was showing the previous frame’s rendered data, creating an interesting hall-of-mirrors effect.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/texture-recursion/texture-recursion.png"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/texture-recursion/texture-recursion.png"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>I was attempting to create an efficient approximation for a line-of-sight

got further apart This was the visualization which showed me I had not
coded what I was envisioning. You can see the darker blue box which was the

<p>I did not keep the code that produced this wonderful catastrophe. But if I
remember correctly, the faulty blurring operation produced a value that was way
larger than it should have been which was subsequently wrapped to cram it into
8 bits, producing these colorful waves.</p>

software <em>tracey</em> as part of a university course. When building a 
volumetric light effect (rays of sunlight reflecting on dust particles 
in the air), there were various parameters to tweak for making the dust 
look like intended. Beginning with large amounts of opaque white dust,

What’s happenning here is simple to explain: you <em>should</em> be seeing a few hundred spheres, most of which are connected to each other with cylinders. For atoms A and B, the way I was programming those connective cylinders was:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make a cylinder whose length is the distance between A and B</li>
  <li>Align it to be parallel to the line segment connecting A and B</li>
  <li>Reposition the cylinder so that one of its ends is touching A (therefore, implicitly, its other end should touch B)</li>
</ol>

<p>Buuuuut, step 3 wasn’t working - this meant that all of the cylinders were sitting with their one end at the origin :)</p>

</div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>When performing finite element statics analysis, one aspect of interest is how components of an object are deformed under load, each vertex of the model has a corresponding displacement in the x-, y- and z-direction. The displacements are added to the actual vertex coordinates and one displacement component is being used to color the model. This is were the bug comes in: the nodes are being stored in a particular order, with subsequent nodes being kinda close to each other on the model. Now if there is an off-by-one error in the code that stores the displacements in the vertex buffers, the color of the nodes will be somewhat correct, while the displacements are being applied in the wrong places.</p></div><p><a href="https://glitchgallery.org/displacement-chaos/displacement-chaos.png"><img src="https://glitchgallery.org/displacement-chaos/displacement-chaos.png"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>I was simulating waves with a bounding box by shoting particles in all directions, and I forgot to convert milliseconds to second, making the simulation time steps 1000 times too big, explaining the behavior.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>This was the result of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing" target="_blank">force directed graph drawing</a> algorithm.
