    <h1>Show HN: Trigger.dev V2 – a Temporal alternative for TypeScript devs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Back in February, we posted a Show HN about building a “developer-first open source Zapier alternative” (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34610686). This was v1 of Trigger.dev.</p><p>During the months since, we’ve gathered a lot of feedback from early users and realized that what developers actually wanted was more like an easier-to-use Temporal with integrations.</p><p>Here’s what we’ve learned so far:</p><p>- Serverless timeouts make it hard for anyone to write reliable background jobs. So our current product makes that easy for Next.js and other full-stack React frameworks. Long-running server support is coming soon.</p><p>- We simplified the architecture to make it far easier to self-host. This was the most common comment in our previous Show HN.</p><p>- We made it much easier to contribute to. You can now add new API integrations for any service we don’t already support. Either publicly (we appreciate PRs) or privately in your existing codebase.</p><p>We’re open about what we’re building (https://trigger.dev/changelog) and what we’re planning on doing next (https://trigger.dev#roadmap) as we believe community feedback ensures that we’re solving real problems.</p><p>So here’s where we’re at, and where we’re headed:</p><pre><code>  [x] Easy self-hosting.
  
  [x] Serverless. Long-running Jobs on your serverless backend.
  
  [x] Integration kit. Build your own integrations, or use ours.
  
  [x] Bring-Your-Own-Auth. You can now authenticate integrations as your users.
  
  [x] Dashboard. View every Task in every Run.
  
  [x] Cloud service. No deployment required.
  
  [x] React hooks. Easily update your UI with Job progress.
  
  [x] React frameworks. Support for Next.js, Astro, Remix, Express.
  
  [ ] More frameworks. Support for SvelteKit, Nuxt.js, Fastify, Redwood.
  
  [ ] Background functions. Offload long or intense tasks to our infrastructure.
  
  [ ] Long-running servers. Use Trigger.dev from your long-running backend.
  
  [ ] Polling Triggers. Subscribe to changes without webhooks.
  
  [ ] And lots more…

I’d love to hear your thoughts on background jobs. Have we missed anything off the list? What should we be building next?</p><p>https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev</p></div></div></div>
