    <h1>2023: The Year of AI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>AI has undoubtedly made waves in 2023 and here we spotlight the most significant stories of the year poised to shape the future of this groundbreaking industry:</p>



<p><em>Correction: In the original blog post published on December 22, 2023, the title “AI Releases” caused confusion as the content encompassed announcements and updates in addition to releases. We clarified the title of the text and infographic. The mention of Stability AI open-sourcing its LLM was excluded from the infographic but left in the article, underscoring its significance in promoting accessibility rather than focusing on tech improvement. The infographic initially featured the establishment of the xAI startup, now removed because of irrelevance. Additionally, the mention of Apple Vision Pro was excluded as the article focuses on software. We also included Midjourney V.6 in the list as it is a very recent release.</em> <em>These adjustments aim to improve accuracy and coherence. We apologize for any confusion and appreciate your understanding!</em></p>



<h4><strong>AI Advancements</strong></h4>



<p>In the landscape of AI advancements this year, notable progress was made, refining existing technologies rather than introducing groundbreaking innovations akin to the <a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/ai-highlights-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">ChatGPT or image generators of the previous year</a>. While there was no wow effect and the real Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is still far away, this year marked an intermediate stage between prior breakthroughs and something even more powerful to come. To showcase this evolution, we crafted a visual timeline, highlighting the most remarkable AI advancements that have shaped this year of AI:</p>

<h4><strong>Legal Landscape</strong></h4>



<p>In the ever-evolving legal realm of AI, 2023 finds itself amidst a landscape filled with uncertainties and ongoing debates. As new challenges emerge, discussions surrounding copyright, corporate policies, and the broader regulatory framework continue, shaping the contours of AI’s legal landscape. Here are the most important legal issues of the year 2023:</p>



<p><strong>European AI Act</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="">European Union introduced the AI Act</a>, the world’s first comprehensive law, to regulate the use of AI. The act classifies AI systems based on the risk they pose and sets forth regulations accordingly. Although the AI Act has been provisionally agreed upon, its implementation faces delays, and the enforcement won’t commence until 2025.</p>



<p><strong>U.S. Copyright Office Stance on Registration of AI-Generated Content</strong></p>



<p>The U.S. Copyright Office took a decisive stance, <a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/top-ai-news-february-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">denying copyright</a> registration for images created by the AI algorithm Midjourney. The rejection set a precedent, asserting that AI artworks solely created by AI, without human involvement, are ineligible for copyright protection. In the same vein, the <a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/top-ai-news-march-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">U.S. Copyright Office issued guidance</a> on AI-assisted works, clarifying that works created by humans using AI tools may be eligible for copyright protection. The guidance confirmed that works created by humans using AI tools should be evaluated based on whether the human role in the creation of those works was determinative.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“Currently, the existing legal system is not prepared to acknowledge copyright for works created with AI, given that AI learns from existing data, the rights to which belong to other people, challenging the attribution of ownership. The practice for addressing this issue is expected to develop next year, facilitated by public participation through <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/policy/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="state-conducted surveys">state-conducted surveys</a>. Resolving this matter independently is now difficult without broader public engagement.” </em></p>
<cite>Daria Kuznetsova, Corporate Lawyer of Everypixel</cite></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/2023-year-in-review/2023-the-year-in-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="">McKinsey</a> also released a comprehensive graph capturing the most important AI governance-related policy and regulatory efforts in 2023. The visual representation highlights the significant contributions of 2023 in shaping the legal landscape of AI.</p>

Here are some of the most noteworthy debates that defined the year:</p>



<p><strong>Corporate Restrictions on ChatGPT</strong></p>



<p>Major financial institutions, including JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo &amp; Co, <a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/top-ai-news-february-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">have restricted ChatGPT usage</a> due to security and privacy concerns. This reflected a broader trend where companies were issuing warnings to employees about the legal considerations associated with AI applications in corporate environments.</p>



<p><strong>OpenAI’s Use of Low-Paid Workers</strong></p>



<p>Time’s investigation exposed OpenAI’s collaboration with Sama, <a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/top-ai-news-january-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">employing low-paid workers in Kenya</a> to sift through sensitive content for ChatGPT. The revelation raised ethical questions about the treatment of workers and the impact of content moderation on mental well-being.</p>



<p><strong>Leadership Transition at OpenAI</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/top-ai-news-november-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Sam Altman’s departure</a> and quick return made headlines last month. A leadership transition unfolded at OpenAI as Sam Altman stepped down amid communication inconsistencies with the board. Interim CEO Mira Murati, along with a majority of staff, advocated for Altman’s return. This unprecedented situation attracted widespread attention, leaving questions about the true reasons behind the transition and future implications.</p>



<p><strong>Adobe and Figma</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2022/Adobe-to-Acquire-Figma/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="">Adobe’s $20 billion acquisition plan for Figma</a> encountered regulatory hurdles, prompting investigations by the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority over potential antitrust issues. The proposed deal’s impact also extended beyond design considerations, as Adobe’s dominance in customer data platforms raised concerns among Chief Information Officers (CIOs) about its potential influence on cloud software spending. However, <a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2023/Adobe-and-Figma-Mutually-Agree-to-Terminate-Merger-Agreement/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="">Adobe abandoned the deal</a> due to challenges in securing antitrust approvals in Europe and the UK, resulting in a termination fee of $1 billion to Figma.</p>



<p><strong>Photographer Hacked the World Photography Awards</strong></p>



<p>Photographer Boris Eldagsen <a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/top-ai-news-april-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">disrupted the Sony World Photography Awards</a> by submitting AI-generated artwork. Eldagsen’s refusal to accept the prize sparked a debate on the place of AI-generated images in traditional photography competitions, challenging perceptions of authenticity and creativity.</p>
