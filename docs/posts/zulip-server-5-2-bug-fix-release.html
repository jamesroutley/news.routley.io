            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We released Zulip Server 5.2 today! This is a bugfix release, containing cherry-picked changes since Zulip Server 5.1.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2>
<p>We recommend that all installations upgrade to this new release. See the <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release">upgrade instructions</a> in the Zulip documentation. If you need help, best-effort support is available on <a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">chat.zulip.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="notable-changes">Notable changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a performance regression in the UI, introduced in 5.0, when opening the compose box.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which could intermittently cause URL previews to fail, if Zulip was being run in Docker or in low-memory environments.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which would cause PostgreSQL 10 and PostgreSQL 11 to attempt to write each WAL log to S3, even if S3 WAL backups/replication were not configured.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which prevented the SCIM integration from deactivating users.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that resulted in an “You unsubscribed” notice incorrectly appearing when new messages arrived in a topic being viewed via a “near” link.</li>
<li>Fixed digest emails being incorrectly sent if a user was deactivated after the digest was enqueued but before it was processed.</li>
<li>Fixed warning about <code>EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD</code> being unset when explicitly set to empty.</li>
<li>Fixed incomplete tracebacks when timeouts happen during Markdown rendering.</li>
<li>Fixed some older versions of Zulip Server not being considered when <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#updating-settings-py-inline-documentation">comparing for the likely original version of <code>settings.py</code></a>.</li>
<li>Stopped using the <code>database_password</code> if it is set but <code>database_user</code> is not.</li>
<li>Stopped trying to fix LetsEncrypt certificate configuration if they were not currently in use.</li>
<li>Sorted and prettified the output of the <code>check-database-compatibility</code> tool.</li>
<li>Split the large <code>zerver/lib/actions.py</code> file into many files under <code>zerver/actions/</code>. This non-functional change was backported to ensure it remains easy to backport other changes.</li>
<li>Updated documentation to reflect that current mobile apps are only guaranteed to be compatible with Zulip Server 3.0 and later; they may also work with earlier versions, with a degraded experience.</li>
</ul>
