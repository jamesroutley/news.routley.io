<p>Accessibility: It&#39;s about people</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><em>How do people who cannot move their arms use your website? What about people who cannot see well or at all? Or people who have difficulty hearing, or understanding, or have other disabilities?</em></p>

<p>This resource introduces how disabled people use the web, including people with age-related impairments. It helps developers, designers, content creators, and others understand the reasons behind creating accessible digital products — including websites, apps, browsers, and other web tools.</p>
