       is my latest most-used iPhone app. It is a simple, free RSS reader.

      RSS is an old technology that it seems most people have forgotten about. Here&#39;s how it works: you enter a link to an RSS &#34;feed&#34;, and your app pulls data from this feed every few minutes or so. When there is a new post from your feed, that post is pulled directly to your app.

      RSS is really simple, so it is still very well supported. Notably, all substack publications automatically have an RSS feed included at

      .

      Blogs are great but I don&#39;t enjoy reading posts in my email, having to remember the websites each one is hosted at, or reading from each publications&#39; different typesetting opinions with varying pop-ups and advertisements. An RSS reader centralizes all content from your blogs into a single place for reading.

      Since I started using this app I spend much more of my &#34;mindless phone time&#34; reading blog posts, which I think is somewhere between marginally good and good.
