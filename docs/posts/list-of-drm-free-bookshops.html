<p>Speculative works that look at our world (or other worlds) in new ways, whether that be peering into the future, a look sideways at an alternative or fantastic past or present, or a hard stare into the face of horror or madness (does that sound like old eps of <em>The Twilight Zone</em>? Well, if that&#39;s the comparison, I&#39;m fine with that)</p>

<p>A diversity of viewpoints, representing not only multiple cultures but subcultures, exploring issues of race, ethnicity, gender, orientation, and many things I haven&#39;t thought of.</p>

<p>Archive of the Odd is always looking for ways to expand how stories are shared, as well as storytelling itself. One way it does this is through Found Fiction. Found fiction is a catchall term for found document, found footage, epistolary, neo-epistolary, and (in some cases) ergodic literature. These are stories told in a “non-fiction” format, such as letters, transcripts, websites, “lost media,” etc.</p>

<p>&#34;We love stories in our family and sometimes we’ll sit around making them up with each other. On one of these occasions I started to tell a story about a toy robot who came alive and escaped out of a window. The story got retold a few times and changed along the way. Eventually it became the beginnings of a book - <em>Sugar the Robot and the race to save the Earth</em>. With some encouragement from the rest of the family, I decided to turn the story into a “proper” book and make it available online.</p>

<p>A second novel <em>Do Not Feed The Troll!</em> was followed by ebooks and short-stories. But this is not about books, it’s about stories and sharing. I decided to make the stories downloadable for free and encourage others to share them.</p>

<p>So that’s what this is about - stories and sharing. I hope you enjoy it.&#34;</p>

<p>Space opera is a pulp genre of science fiction, known for grand, epic adventures, interstellar empires, and complex character relationships. Set against a vast cosmic backdrop, space operas explore themes of heroism, warfare and militarism, political intrigue, and occasionally elements of cosmic horror, as seen in the <em>Aliens</em> movies or fictional universes such as <em>Warhammer 40k</em>. Classic authors include C.L. Moore (Northwest of Earth stories) Isaac Asimov (<em>Foundation </em>series), E.E. &#39;Doc&#39; Smith (<em>Lensman</em> series), Frank Herbert (<em>Dune</em> series), and Joe Haldeman (<em>Forever War</em>). These works captivate readers with thrilling journeys through the numberless stars, weaving human drama into the sublime vastness of the cosmos. Published by Spiral Tower Press.</p>

<p>Writers in this tradition include (but are not limited to) the following: Robert E. Howard, Fritz Leiber, Jack Vance, Michael Moorcock, Karl Edward Wagner, David C. Smith, and many more. “Pulp sword and sorcery” emphasizes active protagonists, supernatural menaces, and preindustrial (mostly ancient and medieval) settings. Some “pulp sword and sorcery” straddles the line between historical and fantasy fiction; at Whetstone, however, we emphatically prefer “secondary world settings,” other worlds liberated from the necessity of historical accuracy.

						<p><strong>Splice is a small press - Splice is an online review - Splice is an anthology</strong></p>

<p>Every two years, UK small press, Splice, publish three collections of short stories to showcase the work of three outstanding writers. Each collection stands on its own, but with a shared aesthetic. Once the three collections have been released, the work of the three authors will be brought together in an anthology. We also publish a novel during this period.</p>

<p>The review is the steady pulse underlying the occasional output of the small press. New material usually goes live online every Monday and Wednesday, including at least one in-depth book review (around 2,000 words) and either another review or an interview with an author, translator, or editor.</p>

<p>At the end of each two-year period, the three authors showcased via the small press come together in anthology in which they “splice” their work with the work of another writer.</p>

<p>Splice exists to attract adventurous readers to the innovative and unconventional works of literature that exist outside the publishing mainstream — works that usually come into being from writers and publishers involved in Britain’s community of small presses.</p>

						<p><strong>Based in Glasgow, Dockyard Press publishes fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and political broadsides.</strong></p>

<p>Dockyard Press publishes books, not authors. We’re about literature, not celebrities or sycophants. Established in 2019, with the publication of <em>Wrecked</em>, the latest in Scottish author Tony Black’s Gus Dury series, and <em>Whoop! Whoop!</em>, a juggalo noir by American author Icy Thug Nutz, and a reprint of the back catalogues of Scottish author Barry Graham and American author Bart Lessard, and the work of American poet and artist daishin stephenson.</p>

<p>Dockyard Press’s political publications favour socialism, Scottish Independence, and not destroying the planet. And they boycott Amazon, and think you should too.</p>

<p>Their mission is to change the way we all think about African writing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#34;We think that contemporary African prose should be rooted in African experience in all its diversity, whether set in filthy-yet-sexy megacities such as Lagos or Kinshasa, in little-known communities outside of Bahia, in the recent past or indeed the near future.</p>

<p>We also think the time has come to build a new body of African writing that links writers and readers from Benin to Bahia. It’s therefore the right time to ask challenging questions of African writing – where have we come from, where are we now, where are we going?  Our role is to facilitate and participate in addressing these questions, as our list grows.  We are still just beginning.&#34;</p>

She hasn’t stopped writing since, and she credits writing as the outlet that allowed her to recover from the nervous breakdown she had after her parents died.</p>

<p>No, you can’t read the novel she scrawled as a teen – she burned it long ago because it was awful.</p>

						<p><strong>The Anthology is a regularly released collection of African speculative fiction stories from Will This Be A Problem.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Will This Be A Problem Anthology is about telling our stories, our way and on our terms. It is a space for Kenyans, and Africans in general, to tell the story as they please. A space with none of the rules for what Africans are supposed to write about. A space for our stories, as diverse and sometimes as ordinary as they may be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An essential addition to the speculative fiction scene, and an important part of decolonising the genre.</p>

						<p><strong>Apex is a small press that publishes works of science fiction, horror, fantasy and non-fiction.</strong></p>

<p>In 2004, publisher Jason Sizemore suffered an early mid-life crisis at the age of 30. Stuck in a go-nowhere city job supporting risk management software, the needed a creative outlet to offset the relentless actuarial numbers and policies he read at work everyday.</p>

<p>Some friends of his ran a nifty DIY saddle-stitch fantasy zine! Why not do that, he thought, except bigger. He set to work learning the basics of editing, typesetting, layout, and printing.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2005, he released issue one of <em>Apex Science Fiction &amp; Horror Digest</em>.</p>

<p>Apex Publications is a publisher of exceptional works of genre fiction. Its editors have a reputation an eye for talent and publishing early works of many outstanding young writers flying under the radar: Tade Thompson, Maurice Broaddus, Lavie Tidhar, Chesya Burke, Erica Satifka, Francesco Verso, and many others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wholly original, always brilliant, and just as wild and weird as the genres it publishes, Apex Magazine is an absolute gem.</p>

						<p><strong>Boss Fight Books, founded in Los Angeles in June 2013, publishes nonfiction documentary-style books about classic video games. Each of our books takes a critical, historical, and personal look at a single game.</strong></p>

<p>Some books focus on the history of the game’s creation, some focus on particular elements like level design, story, and music, some investigate the subculture that has formed around a game, and some reflect on the game&#39;s role in the author&#39;s own life.</p>

<p>Each book is written by a different author from in or out of the video game industry. We work with game designers, game journalists, novelists, voice actors, film critics, musicians, and artists. Most of the time, a book&#39;s subject is chosen by the author because they are passionate and curious about the game.</p>

<blockquote>

						<p><strong>In 1999, Elizabeth Neff Walker embarked on an exciting adventure—publishing ebooks.</strong></p>

<p>An author, in her own right, she was interested in converting her existing published novels into the ebook format. When the publishing houses were slow to adopt the new reading format, she learned everything about transporting the printed word into the digital realm and Belgrave House was born. She used her knowledge to help other authors get the rights to their books back, so they could continue to share their work with readers.</p>

<p>Think of Belgrave House as your online corner bookstore. You’ll find ebooks in various genres including contemporary fiction, fantasy, romance, young adult, time travel, historical fiction, and thrillers. There is also a large selection of mystery series. In addition to publishing new titles, Belgrave House offers an extensive catalog of previously (paper) published fiction in the form of ebooks.</p>

<p>In 2007, Neff launched <a href="https://regencyreads.com">Regency Reads</a>, a Belgrave House imprint specializing in Regency and Georgian era romances.</p>

						<p><strong>Weightless Books is an independent ebooksite devoted to DRM-free ebooks from independent presses.</strong></p>

<p>Weightless Books opened (a soft opening) in March 2010 and has been growing organically ever since.</p>

<p>Weightless are excited by ereaders which allow the printed pages which publishers spend so long making pretty, clear, and readable, to be read onscreen—one reason why whenever possible they will always sell PDFs, particularly from design- or art-heavy publishers, though EPUB now seems to have gained dominance as the format of choice.</p>

<p>Weightless led off with books and zines from Small Beer Press and Blind Eye Books; now we carry lots of indie presses, many of them publishers of science fiction, fantasy, and horror.</p>
