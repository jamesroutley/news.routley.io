<h2><b>Sitting and Standing at Work</b></h2>

 <p><strong>The Perils of Sitting</strong></p>
 <p>Sitting for more than 1 hour has been shown to induce biochemical changes in lipoprotein
 lipase activity (an enzyme involved in fat metabolism) and in glucose 
 metabolism that leads to the deposit of fats in adipose tissue rather than 
 these being metabolized by muscle, and extensive sitting also relates to heart 
 disease risks, so people are advocating standing to work because this use more 
 muscle activity (burns about 20% more calories). These changes happen in both 
 fit people who regularly aerobically work out and also unfit and obese people, 
 and regular exercise doesnâ€™t necessarily address this. Recent 
 studies have indicated a possible increase in the risks of coronary heart 
 disease and kidney disease from excessive sitting. However, the data are 
 correlational and what is unclear from these studies is whether it is sitting 
 that causes these health problems or whether because people have these health 
 problems they sit more than do healthy people.</p>
 <p>Sitting uses less energy than standing and it helps to stabilize the body, 
 so we sit to perform fine motor tasks like driving, computer work, creating 
 detailed drawings or fine micro-surgery. However, for many years ergonomists 
 have recommended that sitting is broken up by periodic standing and moving 
 during the day, preferably 1-2 minutes every 20 to 30 minutes. A large body of research has 
 shown that frequent microbreaks improves levels of comfort, work performance, 
 and reduces the risks of musculoskeletal injuries.</p>
