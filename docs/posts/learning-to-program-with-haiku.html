Haiku, aimed at people who want to be able to write simple
programs to get stuff done, but never had anyone around teach them. Years ago,
I started teaching myself and am an active developer. It&#39;s my turn to give back.</p><p>All of these lessons are distributed under a Creative Commons license which

A hard copy of all of these lessons, compiled and further polished, can be found at the link below. Enjoy!</p><p><a href="https://www.lulu.com/search/?adult_audience_rating=00&amp;contributor=Jon+Yoder">Learning to Program with Haiku at Lulu.com</a></p><h2>Lesson 1</h2><p>Have you ever wanted to learn to program for Haiku (or something else) but
never had the money or the chance? Has something else gotten in the way?
This is quite an opportunity for someone who wants to learn to code. To
kick things off, here&#39;s the first one.</p><div><a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/files/learning_to_program/Learning_to_Program_With_Haiku_Lesson_1.pdf"><img src="https://www.haiku-os.org/images/pdf_32.png" title="Download PDF" alt="Download PDF"/></a></div><div><a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/darkwyrm/2010-01-20_calling_all_haiku_developer_wannabes#comments"><img src="https://www.haiku-os.org/images/App_Chat_32.png" title="Comments" alt="Comments"/></a></div></div></div></div></div>
