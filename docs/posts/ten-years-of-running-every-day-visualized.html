    <h1>Show HN: Ten years of running every day, visualized</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I didn&#39;t start running until I was in my late twenties, and even so I would end up in a pattern where I&#39;d get motivated and go on a couple of runs, take a few days off, go on another run the following week, and next thing you know it&#39;s been a month since I last run. Rinse and repeat.</p><p>In July 2015, something changed. I headed out on a run on a Tuesday, then did another one the next day, and the day after, andâ€¦ I took the Friday off. When I woke up on July 11, 2015 I remember thinking <em>I could have done 4 days in a row</em>, so I set out to try and do that. 4 days turned into a week, then a month, then two, then six, then a year, and here I am, ten years later.</p><p>I&#39;ve had the privilege to run in some amazing places, from the streets of my hometown to the trails of national parks, on all seven continents. I&#39;ve run solo and I&#39;ve run with friends, I&#39;ve run with music and I&#39;ve run with my own thoughts. I&#39;ve run through stress fractures, heart procedures, flus and other physical ailments. I&#39;ve run in frigid sub zero weather and in sweltering heat. Each run has been a new adventure, and I&#39;ve learned something different from every experience.</p><p>Running has changed my life, and I hope I&#39;ll still keep this going in another decade. I&#39;ve been extremely lucky to have had the support of my wonderful wife Molly throughout this journey, and I couldn&#39;t have done it without her patience, how many times has she heard me say<!-- --> <em>I&#39;ll be back in a few!</em> in the mornings.</p></div></div></div>
