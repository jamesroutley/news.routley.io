    <h1>Ask HN: Have you used SQLite as a primary database?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I periodically hear about projects that use/have used sqlite as their sole datastore. The theory seems to be is that you can test out an idea with fewer dependencies (and cost) and that it scales surprisingly far.<p>There are even distributed versions being built for reliability in the cloud: dqlite by canonical (of Ubuntu fame) and rqlite</p><p>Given the complexity it seems like there are use cases or needs here that I&#39;m not seeing and I&#39;d be very interested to know more from those who&#39;ve tried.</p><p><i>Have you tried this?</i>
<i>Did it go well? Or blow up?</i>
<i>Were there big surprises along the way?</i></p><p>- https://sqlite.org
