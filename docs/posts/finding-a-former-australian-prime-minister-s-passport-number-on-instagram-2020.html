<em>A nice message from my friend, with a photo of a boarding pass 🙂 A good thing about messages from your friends is that they do not have any rippling consequences 🙂🙂🙂</em></p><p>The man in question is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott">Tony Abbott</a>, one of Australia’s <em>many</em> former Prime Ministers.</p><p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/tony_abbott_wikipedia.png" alt="if u google tony abbott u get this|small"/>
<em>That’s him, officer</em></p><p>For security reasons, we try to change our Prime Minister every six months, and to never use the same Prime Minister on multiple websites.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><h4 id="the-boarding-pass-photo">The boarding pass photo</h4><p>This particular former PM had just posted a picture of his boarding pass on Instagram (Instagram, in case you don’t know it, is an app you can open up on your phone any time to look at ads).</p><p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/instagrampost.PNG" alt="Instagram post showing boarding pass|large"/>
<em>The since-deleted Instagram post showing the boarding pass and baggage receipt. The caption reads “coming back home from japan 😍😍 looking forward to seeing everyone! climate change isn’t real 😌 ok byeee”</em></p><h4 id="can-you-hack-this-man">“Can you hack this man?”</h4><p>My friend<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> (who we will refer to by their group chat name, 𝖍𝖔𝖌𝖌𝖊 𝖒𝖔𝖆𝖉𝖊) is asking<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> whether I can “hack this man” not because I am the kind of person who regularly commits 𝒄𝒚𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒐𝒏 on a whim, but because we’d recently been talking about boarding passes.</p><p>I’d said that people post pictures of their boarding passes all the time, not knowing that it can sometimes be used to get their passport number and stuff. They just post it being like “omg going on holidayyyy 😍😍😍”, unaware that they’re posting cringe.</p><p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/instagramboardingpasses.png" alt="screenshot of #boardingpass on instagram|medium"/>
<em>People post their boarding passes all the time, because it’s not clear that they’re meant to be secret</em></p><p>Meanwhile, some hacker is rubbing their hands together, being all “yumyum identity fraud 👀” in their dark web Discord, because this happens a <em>lot</em>.</p><p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/boardingpassposts.png" alt="screenshot of #boardingpass on instagram"/></p><hr/><p>So there I was, making intense and meaningful eye contact with this chat bubble, asking me if I could “hack this man”.</p><h3 id="surely-you-wouldnt">Surely you wouldn’t</h3><p>Of course, my friend wasn’t <em>actually</em> asking me to hack the former Prime Minister.</p></div></article></div></div></div>
