    <h1>Base44 sells to Wix for $80M cash</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">There’s a lot of talk in the startup world about how AI makes individuals so productive that it could give rise to a generation of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Single-Handed-Unicorn-Billion-Dollar-Solopreneurs-Business/dp/B0DWSRS62N" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“solo unicorns”</a> — one-person companies worth over $1 billion.</p>

<p>While an actual solo unicorn remains a mythical creature, Israeli developer Maor Shlomo provided compelling evidence Wednesday that the concept might not be impossible. </p>







<p>Shlomo sold his 6-month-old, bootstrapped vibe-coding startup Base44 to Wix for $80 million, Wix <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/06/18/3101508/0/en/Wix-Further-Expands-into-Vibe-Coding-with-Acquisition-of-Base44-a-Hyper-Growth-Startup-that-Simplifies-Web-and-App-Creation-with-AI.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> Wednesday. And the deal was cash, Wix confirmed to TechCrunch. </p>

<p>Admittedly, this wasn’t a billion dollars or close to it. And Shlomo wasn’t truly solo — he had eight employees, Wix confirmed. They will collectively receive $25 million of the $80 million as a “retention” bonus. Wix declined to give details on that part of the deal, like how long they have to stay in their jobs to get full payouts.</p>

<p>Still, Base44’s rapid rise and impressive sale price have been the talk of the <a href="https://x.com/benln/status/1935327374079574427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">vibe-coding community</a>. </p>

<p>In its six months as a stand-alone company, Base44 reportedly grew to 250,000 users, hitting 10,000 users within its first three weeks. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7336025796509077504/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shlomo’s posts</a> on X and LinkedIn, the company was profitable, generating $189,000 in profit in May even after covering high LLM token costs, which he also documented publicly.</p>

<p>Base44 spread mostly through word of mouth as Shlomo, a 31-year-old programmer, shared his building journey on LinkedIn and Twitter. The project began as a side venture, he told <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/s1iflnlelx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Israeli tech news site CTech</a>.  </p>


<p>“Base44 is a moonshot experiment — helping everyone, technical or not, build software without coding at all,” he <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maor-shlomo-1088b4144_excited-to-share-a-project-ive-been-working-activity-7297302969652277252-vcj8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAEjzLUBg333G2D9H7FJaye0FUkOP4V2yos">explained on LinkedIn</a> when he launched it to the public.</p>

<p>It’s one of the newer crop of vibe-coding products designed for non-programmers. Users enter text prompts, and the platform builds complete applications, with database, storage, authentication, analytics, and integration. It also supports email, texting, and maps, with a roadmap for more enterprise-grade security support.</p>

<p>Base44 isn’t unique in this area. Other vibe coders like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/adaptive-computer-wants-to-reinvent-the-pc-with-vibe-coding-for-non-programmers/">Adaptive Computer</a> handle similar infrastructure work. But Base44’s fast rise was astounding all the same.</p>







<p>Shlomo was already known in the Israeli startup community through his previous startup, the Insight Partners-backed data analytics company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/explorium-scores-75m-series-c-just-10-months-after-b-round/">Explorium</a>. His brother is also a co-founder of an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/hackers-are-targeting-machine-identities-token-security-just-raised-20m-to-stop-them/">AI security startup, Token Security,</a> which just raised $20 million led by Notable Capital (formerly GGV Capital) and a bunch of Israeli tech angels.</p>

<p>He quickly gained partnership agreements  for Base44 with big Israeli tech companies like eToro and Similarweb.</p>

<p>After posting about his decision to use Anthropic’s Claude LLM through AWS instead of models by OpenAI — mostly for cost-per-performance reasons — Amazon invited Base44 to demo at a Tel Aviv AWS event last month, which <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maor-shlomo-1088b4144_it-was-an-honor-to-present-base44-on-the-activity-7333519004138942464-EVoB/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAEjzLUBg333G2D9H7FJaye0FUkOP4V2yos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shlomo documented.</a></p>

<p>“Crazy f***ing journey so far,” Shlomo <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341088575049891840/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on LinkedIn</a> when announcing the news of the acquisition. Despite the growth and the profits — or really because of it — he sold his still-bootstrapped company because “the scale and volume we need is not something we can organically grow into … If we were able to get so far organically, bootstrapped, I’m excited to see our new pace now that we have all the resources in place,” he wrote.</p>

<p>For its part, Wix picked up a proven, fast-growing, local vibe-coding platform for a relative song because of its youth. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/why-openai-wanted-to-buy-cursor-but-opted-for-the-fast-growing-windsurf/">OpenAI paid $3 billion for Windsurf,</a> which was founded in 2021. </p>

<p>Wix, of course, offers no-code website building that look professionally designed. Adding a profitable LLM vibe-coding product to its offerings is a logical move.</p>

<p>Shlomo could not be immediately reached for additional comment.</p>
