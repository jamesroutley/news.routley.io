<p>This micro-book is about parsers, memory allocations and arenas.</p>
<ul>
<li>The parser is written in Rust, it parses code in Ruby. You don&#39;t need to know both though.</li>
<li>The change that I&#39;m describing here made a parser that I created in the past to go from 37MB/s to 80MB/s (which is roughly a 2x improvement)</li>
<li>I was able to completely eliminate all heap allocations (the parser is written in Rust, so it runs in <code>#[no_std]</code> mode)</li>
<li>Result of the parsing is located exclusively on arena, so the whole blob of underlying memory can be written on disk and later <code>mmap</code>-ed to quickly get it back if needed, so AST caching is significantly easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>The code is a bit &#34;experimental&#34; but it&#39;s available in the <a href="https://github.com/lib-ruby-parser/lib-ruby-parser/tree/arena-fixes"><code>arena-fixes</code> branch</a> (make sure to enable <code>--features=development</code> if you run it from a Git repo).</p>
<p><strong>I am not going to release it. If you need a Ruby parser better try <a href="https://github.com/ruby/prism"><code>prism</code></a> (it has Rust bindings that are available on crates.io). This whole story is more like an experiment to see if it&#39;s worth doing this type of work.</strong></p>
