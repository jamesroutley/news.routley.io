  <p>I do a lot of electronics projects in my spare time, and I tend to try to make
reusable parts to save myself effort in the future. Because I have to order
ingredients in certain quantities, I often wind up with more than I need for my
project.</p>
<p>So I’ve opened a Tindie store, called Overengineered Widget
Laboratories. Right now there’s one product in the store, called
<a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/owl/keypad-go/">Keypad:GO</a>. See, I built a
sculpture last summer that needed to interact with people through a
phone-style keypad. The keypad interface part of it seemed like something other
people could use, so I made a few extras. This is a very easy way to interface a
keypad or small keyboard to an embedded electronics project, because it handles
all the basics for you — matrix scanning, debouncing, key matrix collisions,
etc.</p>
<p>It will also <em>help you reverse engineer the keypad’s circuit,</em> because often
cheap keypads arrive without good documentation. In the tiny flash of the
embedded microcontroller, I’ve packed a setup wizard that will walk you through
the process of setting up the keypad of your choice. All you need is a terminal
program. This is honestly my favorite part, and I demonstrate it in the video
below.</p>
<p>Here’s Keypad:GO on the back of a cheap keypad from the internet, being wired up
by my tiny dinosaur assistant, Gargantua.</p>
<p><img src="https://cliffle.com/widget/keypad-go-1/step3-a.webp" alt="Keypad:GO being attached to a keypad by a small green dinosaur"/></p>
<p>And here’s the demonstration video:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j0GVO8WBtp8" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After that process is done, it just produces key characters over serial or I2C
— so it can interface with basically any embedded platform.</p>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://cliffle.com/widget/keypad-go-1/">detailed user manual with
more dinosaurs</a> if you’d like to know more.</p>
<p>I’ve published the schematic (linked in the manual) and <a href="https://github.com/cbiffle/keypad-go-firmware">the firmware</a>.
(It’s written in Rust on top of <code>lilos</code>, like most of my personal projects
these days.)</p>
<p>If this looks useful to you and you want to help fund my electronics habit, <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/owl/keypad-go/">I
still have a few of them in stock as of this writing!</a></p>
