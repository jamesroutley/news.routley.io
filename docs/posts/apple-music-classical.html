Beginners can begin their exploration with amazing content from Apple Music Classical editors, including <i>The Story of Classical</i> audio companion guide, and <i>Essentials</i> playlists for classical subgenres, composers, instruments and more. Classical experts can use Apple Music Classical’s powerful search to find any desired recording with just a few keywords.</p> </accordion-item> <accordion-item> <span slot="accordion-title-text">Why a separate classical app?</span> <p>Classical music often involves multiple musicians recording works that have been recorded many times before and are referred to by different names. For example, from the formal Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 14 to the popular byname of Moonlight Sonata, or in multiple languages, such as Mondschein Sonata in German. Such complexities mean that classical music fans have been ill-served by streaming platforms. Until now. A distinct app, included with an Apple Music subscription, gives these classical music lovers the editorial and catalog content they’ve been missing.</p> </accordion-item> <accordion-item> <span slot="accordion-title-text">How can I listen to Apple Music Classical?</span> <p>Start by checking that Apple Music is installed on your smartphone, and that you have an active Apple Music subscription. Then simply download and install the Apple Music Classical app on the same device and you’re all set.</p> </accordion-item> <accordion-item> <span slot="accordion-title-text">Does Apple Music Classical feature other types of music?</span> <p>No. Apple Music Classical is completely focused on classical music.</p> </accordion-item> <accordion-item> <span slot="accordion-title-text">Can I still listen to classical music in Apple Music?</span> <p>Yes. Apple Music Classical is the new way to explore and enjoy classical music. But Apple Music will also offer the world’s largest classical audio catalog along with hundreds of handpicked classical playlists.</p> </accordion-item> <accordion-item> <span slot="accordion-title-text">Can Apple Music Classical play music I saved in Apple Music?</span> <p>Yes. Your classical collection is synced between the two apps because they share the same music library. So any classical tracks, albums, and playlists saved in Apple Music will also be available in Apple Music Classical - and vice versa.</p> </accordion-item> <accordion-item> <span slot="accordion-title-text">Which devices is Apple Music Classical available on?</span> <p>Apple Music Classical was built exclusively for mobile and is available on iOS with Android coming soon.</p> </accordion-item> <accordion-item> <span slot="accordion-title-text">What kind of subscription do I need?</span> <p>There’s no separate subscription for Apple Music Classical. It’s included at no extra cost with all Apple Music subscriptions except the Apple Music Voice Plan. So one subscription gives listeners access to two extraordinary music apps featuring more than 100 million tracks spanning every genre.</p> </accordion-item> <accordion-item> <span slot="accordion-title-text">In which countries is Apple Music Classical available?</span> <p>Available worldwide, wherever Apple Music is offered, excluding China, Japan, Korea, Russia, Taiwan, and Turkey.</p> </accordion-item> </accordion> </div> </div>
