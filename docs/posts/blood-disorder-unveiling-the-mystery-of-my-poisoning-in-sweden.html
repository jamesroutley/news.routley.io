    <h1>Blood Disorder: Unveiling the Mystery of My Poisoning in Sweden</h1>

<h3 id="ed3a">Part 1</h3>



<p id="9c8c">I was sound asleep, in a hazy state, when suddenly I heard the door to the bedroom being opened.</p>



<p id="1a16">My heart skipped a beat: Could she know that the situation had been exposed and was about to kill me? Does she have a knife in her hand? What should I do now?…</p>



<p id="1f98">Before I could come up with a plan, there was a “click,” and the light turned on. I saw a muscular man standing at the door: “I am police.”</p>



<p id="7d31">I rubbed my eyes and looked closely. It was the muscular male police officer who had taken my statement a few hours ago. I checked my watch, and it was July 24, 2021, Saturday, 00:15 AM.</p>



<p id="b768">I hastily put on some clothes and went out of the room. I saw that the light in my children’s room was also on, with only my son sleeping. My daughter and my wife, <strong>Kim</strong>, were not in bed. At that moment, I heard my daughter’s voice downstairs. Following the sound, the police officer behind me said, “Don’t talk to her (referring to <strong>Kim</strong>).”</p>



<p id="3a61">On the stairs, I saw Kim standing helplessly in front of the TV in the living room, wearing only a tank top and underwear. Another muscular man stood beside her, and she seemed to be under some sort of restraint. Although they were both in plain clothes, they were undoubtedly police officers. My three-and-a-half-year-old daughter was murmuring something beside them. She must have sensed the tense atmosphere. When she saw me, she hurried over and took my hand. I took the opportunity to pick her up and take her back to her room to sleep.</p>



<p id="bd89">After a while, the muscular man at the door told me: “She wants her pants.” I found the shorts she had worn the day before on a chair. As I grabbed the clothes, I felt a small bottle. I flipped it out from the clothes and told the police officer, “I found it.” Immediately, the police officer told me, “Don’t touch it with your hands.” I told him, “I didn’t touch it,” and then handed it over to the police.</p>



<p id="4096">I returned to the children’s room to comfort my daughter to sleep. I didn’t know when the police left. All the lights downstairs were on, but I didn’t see anyone. Obviously, <strong>Kim</strong> had been taken away by the police.</p>



<h3>2) 2021-July-17, I discovered the truth</h3>



<p id="863a">Fast forward to the weekend a week ago.</p>



<p id="b995">Less than 2 minutes after I left my water bottle and returned to the table, I noticed that the cap of my water bottle was not in its original position. Our kitchen and living room are connected, and only Kim and our two kids were at home. The kids were in the living room, one playing a Switch game, and the other watching an iPad. They wouldn’t touch my water bottle. Could it be Kim? Why would she tamper with my water bottle? A negative thought crossed my mind, but I instantly dismissed it. It couldn’t be; I must have been mistaken earlier!</p>



<p id="928f">Due to my hypercalcemia for over a year, I underwent numerous tests including PET CT scans, MRI scans, ultrasounds, genetic sequencing, and more, but no cause could be found. My blood calcium levels remained high. Blood samples were sent to research institutions in Denmark, Finland, Gothenburg, and others, but no cause was identified. With no root cause found, all they could do was alleviate the symptoms and reduce the damage to my heart and kidneys. The doctor arranged home care for me, with blood tests and saline drips administered three times a week. Meanwhile, I was instructed to drink as much water as possible every day. I usually drank over 6 liters, sometimes up to 10 liters. So, I constantly had to drink water and use the restroom.</p>



<p id="3866">The second time I felt something was amiss with my water bottle was when I noticed the water level had slightly risen. Again, it was less than 2 minutes after I had left the kitchen to use the restroom. When I returned, the water level had unmistakably increased. A chill ran down my spine, and I felt a hint of suspicion creeping up.</p>



<p id="cae8">From then on, whenever I left my water bottle, I made a tiny mark on the cap with a knife and took a photo of the cap and the water level using my phone camera.</p>

<p id="7b35">Indeed, when I returned from the restroom and checked, the position of the cap had changed again, and the water level had risen slightly. At that moment, I felt like a thunderbolt had struck, my mind went blank. Yet, I still didn’t want to believe it was true.</p>



<p id="a309">I installed monitoring software on an old Android phone at home and placed it in the room where I usually work. I used to work from home everyday due to COVID epidemic.</p>



<p id="5675">I took out my phone and opened the monitoring app. I saw Kim take out a small brown glass bottle from her pocket, then pick up an Coke can from the table, put it back down. Next, she picked up another 1.5-liter water bottle , took a few sips, and then poured the brown liquid from the small bottle into the water bottle. She then left the room. The entire process took less than 20 seconds.</p>

<p>Before, it was just suspicion, but when I witnessed this scene for real, I was truly shocked. I couldn’t hear my son talking beside me, my hands were trembling as I held the phone, and the phone almost slipped from my grasp. Before I could gather my thoughts, Kim entered the room again and continued pouring the remaining liquid from the brown bottle into another water bottle.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1677" data-permalink="https://rattvisan.blog/2024/07/28/yes-i-was-poisoned-by-my-wife-a-software-engineer-of-top3-us-company/20210722-2/" data-orig-file="https://rattvisan.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20210722-2.gif" data-orig-size="428,240" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}" data-image-title="20210722-2" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://rattvisan.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20210722-2.gif?w=300" data-large-file="https://rattvisan.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20210722-2.gif?w=428" tabindex="0" role="button" width="428" height="240" src="https://rattvisan.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20210722-2.gif?w=428" alt=""/></figure>



<p id="874f">I slumped onto the sofa, feeling dizzy and disoriented.</p>



<p id="5979">I couldn’t sleep at all that night because I knew that our family was finished. Our beloved son and daughter were about to lose their intact family. I stayed awake the whole night, not knowing how I managed to get through it.</p>



<p id="2f92">Early the next morning, I sent a text message to my doctor and arranged to meet in the doctor’s office that afternoon.</p>



<p id="251c">As usual on Friday mornings, the nurse came to our apartment to take blood and administer the drip. In the brief two minutes it took me to get up and use the bathroom, Kim completed the poisoning operation within 30 seconds again:</p>

<p id="73a6">In the afternoon, during a break in the doctor’s consultations, I finally met with the doctor. I told her everything I had discovered. I had been holding back my emotions, but when I showed the doctor the video, I couldn’t help but break down in tears. I also gave the doctor the water bottle I had brought with me.</p>



<p id="f18d">About half an hour later, the doctor called me again. She said that after discussing with another one of my primary doctors, they both agreed that we should immediately contact the police. A police man would call me shortly. I found a secluded place to wait for the call.</p>



<p id="f672">Ten minutes later, I received a call from the police, asking me to come to the station for questioning. The interrogation lasted until late at night, around nine o’clock. The police informed me that they wouldn’t take any immediate action and advised me to return home and carry on as if nothing had happened while taking precautions to protect myself.</p>



<p id="1ebf">Due to the lack of sleep the previous night, I was extremely tired that night and drifted off to sleep in a daze, not knowing when exactly I fell asleep.</p>



<p id="878b">Within less than an hour of falling asleep, the scene described at the beginning of this narrative unfolded.</p>



<h3 id="3a9b">Part 2</h3>



<p id="2d2d">At the end of 2018, I was diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Following the doctor’s advice, I started taking prednisone orally in March 2019, even though I had no symptoms at that time, except for elevated ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) levels was a little bit high. In the subsequent three months of follow-up, my ACE levels had returned to normal, and CT scans showed that the granuloma in my lungs were improving. If all went well, the sarcoidosis would have cleared up in six months, and I could stop taking the medication.</p>



<p id="58bc">However, things often don’t go as planned.</p>



<p id="0a82">On September 14, 2019, there was a Chinese food festival at Kungsträdgården. I bought my favorite spicy braised beef there, but it tasted strange, nothing like the familiar taste it used to have. Even though it was a small portion, I couldn’t finish it.</p>



<p id="f831">In September, I contacted my doctor, suspecting that the prednisone were causing diabetes. The doctor asked me to have a blood test.</p>



<p id="ca6c">The blood test results showed a eGFR was of 56 mL/min and a blood calcium level of 3.97 mmol/L.</p>

<p id="0ffc">After seeing the blood test results, the doctor immediately called me and informed me that my blood calcium level was too hight, and hypercalcemia had already hurted my kidneys, with a eGFR of 56 (normal range should be &gt;80), and my blood creatinine level was 131 (normal range 60–100). The doctor instructed me to go to hospital immediately.</p>



<p id="3875">On September 26th, I was admitted to Capio Saint Göran’s Hospital. They immediately fitted me with electrocardiogram equipment, checked my blood oxygen saturation, and I was covered in devices and various tubes.</p>

<p id="fa5b">On the first night, the heart rate monitoring alarmed a lot, and my heart rate dropped to as low as 30 beats per minute. Nurses repeatedly came in, asking, “Are you OK?” to confirm that I was still alive.</p>



<p id="167d">Due to the limited facilities at this hospital, I was transferred to Karolinska huddinge specializing in heart disease by ambulance in early October.</p>



<p id="b239">It was my first time taking ambulance. During the transfer, my body trembled uncontrollably the whole way, and upon arrival at the hospital, my blood pressure was measured at 160/190.</p>



<p id="da9f">During my hospital stay, one blood test revealed a severe overdose of vitamin D in my body. The level of <strong>25-OH Vitamin D</strong> was 938 nmol/L (normal range 75–125), exceeding the limit by 8 times, and the level of <strong>1,25-OH Vitamin D</strong> was 2510 pmol/L (normal range 20–208), exceeding the limit by 12 times.</p>

<p id="6f17">The following day, after a collective consultation involving cardiologists, endocrinologists, and pulmonologists, I was informed that I had hypercalcemia and vitamin D toxicity.</p>



<p id="40a1">The long-term severe hypercalcemia had already hurted my heart and kidneys, leading to kidney failure and AV block I/II/III. The doctors recommended immediate implantation of a pacemaker.</p>



<p id="77d3">In that moment, I felt like the whole world had dimmed.</p>



<p id="ab2a">There was nothing I could do but comply with the treatment. Fortunately, the subsequent treatment went relatively smoothly. After about two weeks of hospitalization, the hypercalcemia was corrected, and there was slight improvement in my creatinine levels. However, it would likely take more than six months for the massive amount of vitamin D in my body to be gradually metabolized, according to the doctor.</p>

<p id="ad41">I was quite health before, I was not mentally prepared to have a pacemaker implanted. I requested further observation and suggested that the pacemaker should only be implanted if absolutely necessary.</p>



<p id="cf09">After one month of discharge from hospital, all blood indicators remained stable, and there was considerable improvement in the heart AV block. Subsequent check-ups showed that my heart condition was improving.</p>



<p id="82be">However, in the following two check-ups, there were signs of further elevation in vitamin <strong>25-OH Vitamin D</strong> levels. I asked the doctor about this, expressing concern that there might be an underlying issue in my body that had not been detected. The doctor suggested that it could be due to measurement errors, didn’t have to worry about it.</p>

<p id="4ff8">It seemed like I thought this ordeal was over.</p>



<p id="2d23">Little did I know, this was just the beginning of my misfortune.</p>



<h3>4) 2020-April, fatigue</h3>



<p id="5ff7">In April 2020, the same symptoms reappeared: fatigue, increased thirst, frequent urination, and sluggish muscle reactions.</p>



<p id="6e4d">As I remember, once I accompanied Kim and children to Skansen, where I felt very low in energy. I struggled to keep up with the children and spent most of the time finding a place to rest my head on the table and sleep. I also constantly felt thirsty.</p>



<p id="584b">By the end of May, blood tests revealed continued hypercalcemia: ionized calcium at 2.12 (normal range 1.15–1.33), total calcium at 4.11 (normal range 2.15–2.50), a eGFR of 35 (normal range should be &gt;80), and a creatinine level of 180 (normal range should be &lt;100). Furthermore, the vitamin <strong>25-OH Vitamin D</strong> level was at a staggering 1500 nmol/L, even higher than the 938 nmol/L measured in October 2019.</p>



<p id="cf35">Overall, the situation was worse than the episode in September 2019.</p>

<h3>5) 2020-June, Hypercalcemia again</h3>



<p id="2c63">I called nurse for help, finally had a blood test on June 1st.</p>

<p>During my hospital stay, there were multiple instances of my heart rate dropping sharply to 30 bmp, triggering alarms throughout the hallway. In the middle of the night, around 3 o’clock, a group of nurses and doctors surrounded me. Ultimately, they had to resort to administering Bricanyl(Epinephrine medicine) to raise my heart rate.<br/></p>

<p>In the following days, I underwent continuous IV fluid therapy for 24 hours a day. This rapid intervention quickly corrected the hypercalcemia, and there was some relief in my heart rate issues as well.</p>

<p id="1323">On the weekend I was discharged from the hospital, I cooked some beef for myself and ate half of it. When I returned from the bathroom, I noticed a bitter taste in the beef and a spicy sensation in the half-bottle of cola. Given my previous experience with changes in taste related to high blood calcium levels, I immediately suspected that my blood calcium levels had risen again. Since the taste was unpleasant, I poured out the remaining beef and cola.</p>



<p id="0e36">Sure enough, in the afternoon, I felt very tired and fatigued. I didn’t even have the energy to hang out with the children on the sofa. Kim, being considerate, suggested that I go sleep in the bedroom while she took care of the children.</p>



<p id="473a">We had arranged to have a follow-up appointment a week later, and as expected, my blood calcium levels had returned to the same levels as before my previous hospitalization. I was readmitted immediately. After around the clock of continuous IV fluid therapy, my blood calcium levels were corrected after 4 days, and I was discharged again.</p>



<p id="6218">However, a few days after returning home, I started feeling unwell again, leading to another hospitalization after a follow-up check-up.</p>



<p id="9c0a">This cycle continued repeatedly, and between June and August, I was admitted to the hospital more than 10 times.</p>

<p>The peak of my blood calcium levels marked the beginning of each hospitalization, and each time it reached its lowest point, it signaled my discharge from the hospital.</p>

<p>The doctors also found it confused. Despite drinking 5.5 to 7 liters of water every day, my calcium levels couldn’t be maintained within the normal reference range. Once IV fluid therapy was initiated, the calcium levels would decrease again.</p>

<p id="c268">The doctor wrote in the my medical journal: “During his hospitalization, he took medication on time, and even without IV fluid therapy, his blood calcium levels were normal. However, once he returned home, his blood calcium levels became elevated. It is evident that he did not adhere to the medication schedule at home as instructed.”</p>



<p id="492f">This statement is obviously not true. I set alarms on my phone to remind me to take medication. When it’s time, I take the stomach-protecting medicine first, then set a timer for 30 minutes before having breakfast. After breakfast, I set another timer for 30 minutes and then take medications such as prednisone, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, vitamin B12, and folic acid. These medications have been with me for over a year, and I have not skipped taking them even one day.</p>



<p id="7821">Why drinking plenty of water didnt work, but IV fluid therapy worked for hypercalcemia very well?</p>

<p>The doctor mentioned “dramatic course of care.” in my journal where blood calcium levels spike after discharge, leading to readmission to the hospital.<br/></p>

<p>Why was it that everything was normal in the hospital even without I fluid therapy, but once I return home, hypercalcemia came again?<br/></p>

<p>Till 2021-August, I’d been in and out of the hospital more than ten times. While in the hospital, the treatment mainly involves simple IV fluid therapy to lower calcium levels. However, I was occupying a whole room, which seemed like a waste of medical resources.</p>

<p id="4ebd">For the following year, I received IV therapy at home. Despite the treatment alleviating symptoms, there was not even the slightest improvement in the issues of elevated blood calcium and excessive vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>Every doctor believes that the excessive amount of vitamin D in my body must have been acquired from external sources (food or water), as it’s unlikely that my body could produce such a large amount of vitamin D on its own.</p>

<p>Despite receiving IV therapy 3–7 times a week, my blood calcium levels remained consistently high. I often complained to the doctor about how hypercalcemia affects my sense of taste, as I frequently perceive water to taste strange. Is this a viable clue, and is there a medical explanation for it? However, the doctor also mentioned that they had never heard of hypercalcemia affecting taste sensation.</p>

<p id="a088"><strong>Why strange taste</strong>? Nobody knew.</p>



<p id="19f3">I am immensely grateful to the two endocrinologists <strong>Martin Larsson</strong> and <strong>Sigridur Björnsdottir</strong>, whose expertise and compassionate care saved my life during my illness. Their dedication to their profession and unwavering commitment to my well-being were truly remarkable. Without their skillful intervention and support, I might not be here today. Their expertise, coupled with their empathetic approach, made all the difference during a challenging time in my life. I cannot thank them enough for their exceptional care and support.</p>



<h3>6) 2021-Jan, I almost died</h3>



<p id="bc9c">On January 8, 2021, a Friday night, a “allergic” reaction during IV fluid therapy almost took me my life.</p>



<p id="19af">I immediately shouted for her to stop pushing the syringe and call the doctor. She hesitated abnormally, claiming she had no doctor’s phone number.</p>

<p id="66dd">On next Monday January 11th, as usual, a nurse came to my home in the morning around 9 o’clock to take blood samples and put IV fluid on me.</p>



<p id="2c66">Following the usual procedure, he began flushing the PICC line on my arm with a low-concentration saline solution. As soon as he pushed in a bit, I immediately felt the same sensations as the previous Friday: my blood vessels heating up, my heart rate accelerating. I promptly asked him to stop. He was alarmed and asked me to calm down while he called the doctor again for further instructions.</p>

<p>However, the cause of that incident has not been determined.<br/></p>



<h3>7) Where are Vitamin D and calcium from?</h3>



<p id="9a42">I had been asking the doctor where the excessive vitamin D and persistently high calcium levels in my body was coming from.</p>



<p id="d3f4">The doctor conducted tests on the seasoning packet used for the braised beef, but found no abnormalities. They also analyzed the electrolyte content of the tap water in my area but found no issues.</p>



<p id="aaf4">There was suspicion of tumors in my body, so I underwent three PET-CT scans, multiple MRI scans, ultrasounds, bone density tests, and genetic sequencing, but no abnormalities were found.</p>



<p id="dd34">The doctor suspected a dietary issue and prescribed protein nutritional drinks for me. I consumed only three bottles of these drinks daily, along with small amounts of staple foods and no vegetables, for 6 consecutive months, but there was no improvement in the high calcium levels.</p>



<p id="723d">I even conducted a fasting test, abstaining from food for three days and only consuming water, yet my blood calcium remained high.</p>



<p id="6092">During a one-week fasting period, I monitored my blood glucose levels regularly and ate a piece of fruit when my blood sugar was low. However, there was no sign of a decrease in blood calcium levels during or after the fasting period.</p>



<p id="8148">For a period of time, I spent over three thousand kronor buying bottled mineral water from the ICA MAXI, with a calcium content of only 10.7 mg/L. I drank it continuously for two months, but there was no improvement in my blood calcium levels at all.</p>



<p id="7a7f">If blood calcium didn’t come from the body, food, or water, then where did it come from? I firmly believe that my tests were accurate, so could there be something undetected in my body?</p>



<p id="30c2">Although IV fluid therapy can alleviate symptoms, the deterioration of renal function can be observed from the creatinine levels.</p>



<p id="1da3">I couldn’t sit idly by and wait for the worst. I must go to hospitals in China for a second opinion.</p>



<p id="6d17">I think she couldn’t wait any longer. Because once I go to China, the hypercalcemia will immediately resolve on its own, and she will be at risk of exposure.</p>







<h3>8) What I had experienced</h3>



<p id="dd21">The past two years for I have been filled with numerous medical procedures and treatments.</p>



<p id="2774">Here are the statistics:</p>



<ul>
<li>3 times: Full-body MRI scans and echocardiograms</li>



<li>3 times: Full-body PET-CT scans</li>



<li>3 times: Full-body bone density tests</li>



<li>3 times: Ambulance transport to the hospital</li>



<li>11 times: Hospitalizations for treatment</li>



<li>182 times: Home nursing visits for care</li>



<li>321 days: Duration of PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) in your body</li>



<li>336 times: IV blood draws for testing</li>



<li>1200 hours: Total duration of IV therapy, spent sitting at the table working despite illness</li>



<li>3720 milliliters: Equivalent to 75% of my blood volume has been taken out for testing</li>



<li>6000 milliliters: Minimum daily water intake required</li>



<li>600,000 milliliters: Amount of saline solution infused into your body for treatment</li>
</ul>

<p>In the past two years, despite numerous tests, the underlying cause of my condition remained elusive. Doctors resorted to daily IV therapy to lower your blood calcium levels. They also advised me to consume fewer calcium-rich foods and avoid excessive sunlight exposure.</p>



<p id="9dd3">Breakfast could only be breads, no butter, no eggs, because they are all rich in vitamin D. I dared not drink fruit juice because of long-term use of prednisone, which leads to diabetes, and drinking fruit juice will further increase blood sugar.</p>



<p id="1b1f">Almost every day, I stayed at home for IV infusion, and couldn’t exercise because a PICC catheter was implanted in my body. I couldn’t engage in strenuous exercise or carry heavy objects normally, so my physical condition was getting worse. If I only needed 2 liters of IV infusion, and it is completed around 8:00 in the evening, I could go out for a walk, often returning around 10:00 in the night. If unfortunately I need 3 liters of saline, then I basically couldn’t go out all day.</p>



<p id="ac6e">Taking a shower at night was also a problem. To avoid infection, I needed to put a plastic bag on my arm and tie it with rubber bands at both ends before taking a shower. I hade to raise my right hand and wash with the other hand.</p>



<p id="0bdd">In the summer of 2020, despite taking double doses of prednisone, high blood calcium levels could not be controlled. In August of the same year, I started taking methotrexate. A month later, severe oral ulcers appeared, and both the upper and lower lips were rotten, making it impossible to eat normally for several weeks. And severe hair loss, there were handfuls of hair next to the chair where I often sat. Kim often came to my room to help me clean up the hair. At that time, I was really moved. I thought she didn’t complain at all when I was sick, and even helped clean up my room. What a good wife!</p>



<p id="74db">As early as the summer of 2020, the doctor asked me if Kim and I usually shared a meal and how my relationship with Kim was. The doctor also talked to Kim. Now it seems that these questions all had deeper implications, but I was naive at the time and ignored these questions.</p>



<p id="d3d4">I never thought of the word “poisoning” because I really couldn’t connect the “elite” who graduated from a prestigious university in China and worked for one of the top three companies in the world with “criminals”. I deeply understand the cost of crime.</p>



<p id="3044">Over the past few years, my blood calcium levels have fluctuated widely, often exceeding the upper limit of the normal range, which is 1.33 mmol/L. However, since Kim was arrested by the police on July 24rd, my blood calcium levels have consistently remained within the normal range of 1.15–1.33 mmol/L.</p>
