            <p>¡Hola mi gente! It&#39;s your Bolivian girl here, ready to spill the beans on my wild ride through week 4 at Recurse Center. I&#39;ve been dancing through code, tangoing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Graham">Martha Graham</a>, and cha-cha-cha-ing with AI - it&#39;s been a fiesta of learning and emotions! Let&#39;s salsa our way through the highlights, challenges, and takeaways. 💃🕺</p>

  The Accomplishments: ¡Look at Me Go! 🚀
</h2>

<p><strong>Martha Graham Chats</strong>: I deployed a <a href="https://choreo-chatbot.vercel.app/">webapp chat with Martha Graham</a> herself! And guess what? She told me I can call myself a dancer.</p>

<p><strong>NextJS Mastery</strong>: I learned NextJS like a boss, thanks to <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/">their live tutorial</a>. Who said coding can&#39;t be a dance? 💻💃</p>

  Challenges: When the Rhythm Stumbles 😅

<p><strong>Time Tango</strong>: Dancing with time can be a struggle. It&#39;s hard to start coding at 10 am when the goal is unclear. But hey, even dance steps can be tricky to get right sometimes! ⌛💃</p>

<p><strong>Cumbia Towards Clear Goals</strong>: Clear goals make you move forward, even if you end up doing the Electric Slide instead of the Cha-Cha Slide. Keep moving! 🚀💃</p>

<p><strong>Awesome Rumba</strong>: The presentation about generative AI for artists stole the show! A standing ovation, please! 🎉👏🎨</p>

<p>My heart&#39;s pounding like the beat of a bombo 🥁! I&#39;m ecstatic about creating Choreo AI, busting moves and generating new dances. Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll add some AI-generated music for the ultimate dance party? It&#39;s not just about the app, but the dance of discovery and learning! 🎶🕺💃</p>

  The Flow-State: When Time Danced Away 🕰️💃
</h2>

<p>When I&#39;m in the flow, the rhythm takes over! Finishing my app with specific next steps had me flowing with ease. Maybe it&#39;s time for more planning with my code sessions! 💻💃</p>

<p>I realized I have a thing for patterns, like the steps in a salsa. Structured weeks and timely meals made everything click, even when the dance floor got a little bumpy. I&#39;m proud of myself for moving, even if it&#39;s just baby steps! 👣💃</p>

<p>Next week, I&#39;ll help fellow dancers with their projects, perfecting my understanding of their moves for the coming performance. And you bet, I&#39;ll take care of myself better - earlier bedtime and a digital detox to keep those dance moves groovy! 💤💃📵</p>
