    <h1>Ask HN: My family business runs on a 1993-era text-based-UI (TUI). Anybody else?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Is anybody still using TUI applications for business?</p><p>My family company is a wholesale distribution firm (with lightweight manufacturing) and has been using the same TUI application (on prem unix box) since 1993. We use it for customer management, ordering, invoicing, kit management/build tickets, financials - everything. We&#39;ve transitioned from green screen terminals to modern emulators, but the core system remains. I spent many summers running serial and ethernet cables.</p><p>I left the business years ago to become a full time software engineer, but I got my start as a script kiddie writing automations for this system with Microsoft Access, VBA, and SendKeys to automate data entry. Amazingly, they still have a Windows XP machine running many of those tasks I wrote back in 2004! It&#39;s brittle, but cumulatively has probably saved years of time. That XP machine could survive a nuclear winter lol.</p><p>I recently stepped back in to help my parents and spent a day converting many of those old scripts to a more modern system (with actual error-handling instead of strategic sleep()s and prayers) using Python and telnetlib3. I had a blast and still love this application. I can fly around in it. Training new people was always a pain, but for those that got it—they had super powers.</p><p>This got me thinking: Are other companies still using this type of interface to drive their core operations? I’m reflecting on whether the only reason my family&#39;s business still uses this system is because of the efficiency hacks I put in place 20+ years ago. Without them, would they have been forced to switch to a modern cloud/GUI system? I’m not sure if I’m blinded by nostalgia or if this application is truly as wonderful as I remember it.</p><p>I’d love to hear if and how these are still being utilized in the real world.</p><p>P.S. The system we use was originally sold by ADP and has had different names (D2K, Prophet21). I believe Epicor owns it now (Activant before).</p><p>P.P.S. Is anybody migrating their old TUI automation scripts to a more modern framework or creating new ones? I’m super curious to compare notes and see what other people are doing.</p></div></div></div>
