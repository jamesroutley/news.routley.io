    <h1>Modeling my Grandpa with 3D Photogrammetry (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today I released a video about how—and why—I 3D Printed my Grandpa and put him on my bottle of ketchup. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-om1dxKbN4">Watch it here</a>.</p>

<p>I sculpted a bust of my Grandpa in high school, gave it to my grandparents, got it back after he died and my Grandma moved out of her house (I wrote a <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2014/grandpa-charlie">tribute to my &#39;Grandpa Charlie&#39;</a>), and I kept on moving it around my office because I didn&#39;t have room for it:</p>

<p>I decided it had to go, but asked my extended family if anyone wanted the statue (thinking it would be sad to destroy it). One enterprising cousin suggested he could &#39;copy&#39; the statue in smaller form using <strong>photogrammetry</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;d take many pictures of the statue</li>
<li>He&#39;d convert it into a 3D model using software algorithms</li>
<li>He&#39;d print a smaller (and <em>much lighter</em>) copy of the bust for any takers</li>
</ul>

<p>The video above goes into more detail about the entire journey, but in this blog post I wanted to give some detail about the photogrammetry process itself.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/jeff-looks-at-3d-printed-grandpa-ketchup-bottle.jpg" alt="Jeff Geerling looks at Grandpa 3D Printed Ketchup Bottle Topper" width="578" height="325"/></p>

<p>Coming into it, it seemed like some form of magic. And after generating a highly-detailed 3D model from a physical object with nothing but my camera and my laptop, it still feels like magic. But at least it&#39;s highly deterministic magic that can be grasped.</p>

<h2>Taking Pictures</h2>

<p>Any Photogrammetry adventure begins with capturing photographs of a 3D object.</p>

<p>In my case, the object was a bust of my Grandpa, which weighed 16 lbs (7.26 kg) and was about 1 foot (30 cm) wide.</p>

<p>I could&#39;ve set the bust on a surface and walked around taking pictures of it, relying on software to &#39;clean things up&#39; for me.</p>

<p>But as a programmer, I know <em>garbage in equals garbage out</em>, and the cleaner the images, and the more precisely they are taken, the less work I&#39;ll have to do later cleaning up artifacts or touching up an imprecise model—at least that&#39;s my theory.</p>

<p>So I built a rotating turntable out of two round pieces of wood and a <a href="https://amzn.to/34c5Be1">lazy susan bearing</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/turntable-assemble.gif" alt="Assembling turntable or lazy susan using drill" width="347" height="220"/></p>

<p>I set it up with a pure white background (a sheet of posterboard), and measured out 10° increments on a piece of tape I put on the DIY lazy susan, so I could rotate it precisely.</p>

<p>Finally, I took a series of 148 pictures, from four elevations:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/grandpa-bust-spinning.gif" alt="Grandpa bust spinning - photogrammetry" width="480" height="320"/></p>

<p>I pulled those pictures into the computer, tweaked the exposure a bit so the white background was blown out a tiny bit (pure white), and had a set of 24 megapixel JPEGs ready for the photogrammetry process—over 3.5 billion pixels of data to work with!</p>

<h2>First Attempts (Failures)</h2>

<p>Since I have a Mac (a 2019 16&#34; Macbook Pro with an i9 processor at the time), I don&#39;t have any Nvidia CUDA cores at my disposal (locally, at least). And it seems some of the more GUI-driven photogrammetry programs (which often require CUDA cores) are Windows-only.</p>

<p>But I eventually found the free and cross-platform app <a href="http://www.regard3d.org">Regard3D</a>, and I followed the official <a href="http://www.regard3d.org/index.php/documentation/tutorial">tutorial</a>. I was able to get a result, but the resulting 3D mesh was really messy:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/regard3d-grandpa-spin.gif" alt="Grandpa Regard3D blobby goo model" width="415" height="325"/></p>

<p>You could see my Grandpa, but he seemed to be frozen in a bed of goo. It would&#39;ve required a lot of work in Meshmixer to get a faithful reproduction of the original bust.</p>

<p>I sent my cousin the same set of pictures, but was also having trouble getting a good initial model.</p>

<h2>Second Attempt: COLMAP + OpenMVS</h2>

<p>Finally, I found <a href="https://peterfalkingham.com/2018/04/01/colmap-openmvs-scripts-updated/">this blog post on COLMAP + OpenMVS</a> from Dr. Peter L. Falkingham. He wrote a <code>.bat</code> script that uses the two open source tools (on Windows, at least) to generate a 3D model from a set of images.</p>

<p>I needed to install COLMAP and OpenMVS, and luckily, I <em>also</em> found an excellent Instructable by joecooning, <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Free-Photogrammetry-on-Mac-OS-From-Photos-to-3D-Mo/">Free Photogrammetry on Mac OS: From Photos to 3D Models</a>, and followed his instructions to install them:</p>

<h3>Install COLMAP</h3>

<p>Download the latest <code>COLMAP-dev-mac-no-cuda.zip</code> file from the <a href="https://github.com/colmap/colmap/releases">COLMAP GitHub releases page</a>, expand it, and place COLMAP in the Applications folder.</p>

<h3>Install OpenMVS</h3>

<ol>
<li>Install OpenMVS&#39; dependencies <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation">with Homebrew</a>: <code>brew install boost eigen opencv cgal ceres-solver</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://cmake.org/install/">Install CMake</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Install XCode</a>.</li>
<li>Clone the VCG Library: <code>git clone https://github.com/cdcseacave/VCG.git vcglib</code></li>
<li>Clone OpenMVS: <code>git clone https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS.git</code></li>
<li>Create a separate build directory to build OpenMVS: <code>mkdir openMVS_build &amp;&amp; cd openMVS_build</code></li>
<li>Build OpenMVS: <code>cmake . ../openMVS -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DVCG_ROOT=&#34;</code>pwd<code>/vcglib&#34; -G &#34;Xcode&#34;</code></li>
<li>Use xcodebuild to compile the app: <code>xcodebuild -configuration Release</code></li>
</ol>

<h3>Run <code>photogrammetry.sh</code></h3>

<p>Use <a href="https://gist.github.com/geerlingguy/7049523be6bbd3e7af3e9251a14b052b">this shell script</a> (embedded below) to run the photogrammetry process inside a directory full of images of the object you wish to turn into a 3D model:</p>



<p>After running the script, the new &#39;model&#39; directory should contain a <code>.jpg</code> texture map image, a <code>.mtl</code> (material settings) file, and an <code>.obj</code> (3D object) file.</p>

<p>I imported the <code>.obj</code> file in the free <a href="https://www.meshmixer.com">Meshmixer</a> app, and WOW, it was pretty much dead-on... besides the fact that the object was upside-down:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/colmap-openmvs-grandpa-spin.gif" alt="COLMAP OpenMVS grandpa object imported into MeshMixer" width="415" height="325"/></p>

<h2>The Final Result</h2>

<p>So I spent a bit of time cleaning up the bottom edges in Meshmixer, and doing a &#39;plane cut&#39; to slice off the bottom and discard all the artifacts from the lazy susan/turntable. Then I made the object a solid (this isn&#39;t <em>strictly</em> necessary for 3D printing, but it&#39;s easier to work with in my case) and exported it.</p>

<p>It looks pretty amazing, even capturing some of the tiny details that the naked eye would likely miss at a glance!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one brief clip of a 3D print I made of this model (generated with <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/3d-printing#octolapse-and-nikon-d700">Octolapse and my Nikon D700</a>):</p>
