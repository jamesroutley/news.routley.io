        The People
      </h3>
      <p>In a typical weekday, 425,000 people enter a station along the red, orange, or blue lines.  On weekends and holidays, that number drops to 200,000.  The busiest day was Friday February 7 when 470,187 people entered the system.</p>
      <p>
        This heatmap shows the average number of people that
        <a href="#" data-dim="exits">enter</a>
        and
        <a href="#" data-dim="entrances">exit</a>
        stations along the red, orange, and blue line for every hour over the entire month based on records from turnstiles at each station.  Each row represents one week. You can see weekends and weekdays with daily peaks at rush hour, as well as
        <a href="#" data-highlight="holidays">a holiday</a>,
        and
        <a href="#" data-highlight="snow">two snow storms</a>.
        Our exit data is less reliable since not all stations require that people exit through a turnstile.
