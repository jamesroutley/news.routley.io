    <h1>Google Web Environment Integrity Is the New Microsoft Trusted Computing</h1>

        <p>Disclaimer: I work at Microsoft but not on Windows or Edge. I also don’t have
a full understanding about Web Environment Integrity, but am basing this off
what I understand. This article states my opinions, as opposed to that of my
employer.</p>
<p>If you haven’t been under a rock, you may have heard about Google’s evil
<a href="https://stackdiary.com/web-environment-integrity/">Web Environment Integrity</a>
“proposal”. Supposedly, this is to make sure a browser environemnt can be
“trusted”, but it seems Google wants this so they can kill ad blockers.</p>
<p>This looks a lot like Microsoft’s ill-fated “Palladium” they wanted to ship
with Vista. Palladium was an attempt to improve Windows security by adding
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc723472.aspx">attestation and integrity</a>,
but could also be abused to enforce DRM everywhere on your PC, block competing
but “untrusted” applications such as Firefox. The only saving grace was Vista’s
very painful and long development period where
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/whatever-happened-to-microsofts-drm-plan/">Palladium was eventually killed</a>
so Vista could actually ship.</p>
<p>Palladium was renamed “Next-Generation Secure Computing Base” but it’s easier
to call it by the former name so I’ll just use that. Also, some features such
as BitLocker, UEFI Secure Boot (Windows 8), and TPM requirements (Windows 11)
did make their way, but they can be disabled or bypassed.</p>
<p>While I was only a young child during the development of Windows Vista, I am
pretty good at reading up on tech history.</p>
<p>Going back, Google takes
<a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md">“inspiration”</a>
from their infamous Play Integrity API (also known as
SafetyNet) used on Android, which is often used to block rooted phones from
using certain apps such as Netflix, Google Pay, and banking apps.</p>
<p>Well, guess what? People who root their devices and use custom ROMs like
LineageOS (myself included) nowadays hide root from bad apps and can pass these
checks anyways. I use Google Pay all the time on my OnePlus 11 running an
unofficial LineageOS build, thanks to root hiding. Does Google not realize how
commonly bypassed Play Integrity is? In fact, it is easy even on Google’s very
own Pixel devices, as someone who previously used multiple generations of Pixel
devices, including the Pixel 7.</p>
<p>Unless you can only use an official signed Google Chrome binary, what’s
stopping people from modifying Chromium and faking these checks? Unless that’s
the strategy.</p>
<p>Even on the web today, there are bad actors like Chase Bank who claims to
<a href="https://www.chase.com/digital/resources/privacy-security/security/system-requirements">“require” only Windows or Mac</a>
(like it’s still 2003)
and uses this as justification to block BSD and Linux-on-ARM without user agent
switchers. The only reason why this isn’t in the media is because Chase allows
Linux-on-x86 and Chrome OS, due to both having &gt;2-3% market share each. In fact,
I can log into Chase.com on my Fedora laptop fine without modifications.</p>
<p>If Chase was equipped with Web Environment Integrity, they could impose the
worst of the early 2000s web on their customers, maybe only making “exceptions”
for Chromebooks and common Linux distros to avoid the obvious uproar. Or worse,
Chase could mandate your PC has Secure Boot and no ad blocker in order to pay
your credit card or mortgage. And not just Chase, but any bank. It would be
even worse for certain fintechs which require their app for customer service
and bill payments: look at the X1 credit card.</p>
<p>In many ways, if we get Web Environment Integrity, we’ll need every government
to regulate Google, Apple, Microsoft, and adtech in every way possible, and
also add unbundling requirements so any browser can attest as long as it’s not
obvious malware.</p>
<p>After all, going back to the Windows 8 era, UEFI Secure Boot couldn’t lock out
Linux since we put pressure on Microsoft to sign Linux distros. There was also
an antitrust fear if desktop Linux went extinct, which helped. We could force
Google to bless small browsers like Vivaldi and Tor Browser the same way.</p>
<p>Better off Web Environment Integrity API becomes Palladium and dies in a
long-abandoned Chromium branch. After all, Windows Longhorn pre-reset, compete
with Palladium probably still exists in source, but is full of cobwebs rotting
away on some long-forgotten-about Azure DevOps server.</p>
<p>It’s not impossible to win this fight, we won the fight against Palladium, even
with a well-resourced Microsoft combined with the PC industry, if not the NSA
and MPAA. If we fight hard, we can win against Google’s anti-user Web Integrity
attempts also.</p>
<p>So, get the EFF and FSF involved: we need to be loud.</p>
