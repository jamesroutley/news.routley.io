    <h1>Unbundling Airbnb</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>“Go to Airbnb, pick a niche and execute it 10x better.”</p><p>This was the opening to my recent social media post.</p><p>So far, it has gained 2 million views on Linkedin and Twitter—Nuts!</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0a220dad6bad8773c0c707/624351e4a4f785516832a0d5_c3NeKqTAOxrhRh0YBYt5DW0VbysarAsVvy39gqfY-gwHPG8uarCPYYT8wM-qny5sCeCAvt7qqDddK2wnQ8rVVK7ONbVuA5A0pehAsFJGjPbDhdSRwhjqmQTrTDj93M3eqARusqgH.png" alt=""/></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>I promised to dive deeper, so let&#39;s do it!</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Unbundling, huh? </strong>‍</h3><p>There are only two ways to make money in business: One is to <em>bundle</em>; the other is to <em>unbundle</em>. </p><p>Those are not my words. That statement was <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling" target="_blank">popularized</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca" target="_blank">Marc Andreessen</a>, co-creator of the hugely influential Mosaic Internet browser, co-founder of Netscape, and a famous VC.</p><p>So the idea behind unbundling of Airbnb is simple: Pick a niche use case with passionate but unsatisfied guests and then build a business around it. We will soon go into specific examples.</p><p>Craiglist can help us understand unbundling. Many popular startups &#34;just&#34; picked a category on Craigslist, “unbundled it” and made it 10x better.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0a220dad6bad8773c0c707/624351e551505ea397e61d41_TxiGg2XECUSJYmP84wC2dczc78d4a5qRz9Jv_JdN7evKOHRDC2Uy_TKoHP-s4F6zamyF0TVTBZMHHhS40rcaFV4-gb7eZn87fAlzMUogQ6oM1KTZNXZHDPSydTZK5vnWEgSxhJL1.png" alt=""/></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Airbnb picked vacation rentals, and Zillow gobbled up everything else related to real estate. Unbundling Craigslist is a great concept that helps explain the growth of internet marketplaces in the last decade. </p><p>Would these marketplaces exist without Craigslist? Probably. But that’s a different story.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Unbundling Airbnb - the wrong way</strong></h3><p>After my post went viral, startup founders started pinging me with messages. </p><p>Many saw it as confirmation of their own business approach:</p><ol role="list"><li>Pick a niche on Airbnb </li><li>Create a niche marketplace that looks like Airbnb</li><li>Collect $$$</li></ol><p>‍</p><p>So easy! But they all kind of struggle with the last step.</p><p>I&#39;m a big fan of Airbnb, I believe in the long-term vision of the company and I wouldn&#39;t bet against Brian Chesky!</p><p>Airbnb created an amazing business with a massive inventory, strong brand, security, simple payments, and a comprehensive user experience. Their support is not in the best shape right now but that&#39;s definitely fixable mid-term. </p><p>But don&#39;t think you can create a significant business simply by copying Airbnb in a niche market. </p><p>At least once a week someone pitches me an idea for the “Airbnb for digital nomads” marketplace and they are totally convinced that it’s going to work. </p><p>Bad news to share here: nobody is going to book a trip on some no-name platform instead of Airbnb unless that platform is doing something <em>10x better</em>. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0a220dad6bad8773c0c707/624351e5d331b162c2c8b32a_UoEkvTz4FIrD2rExMFIscAh6tE-FlBdXVPgnUj49vey3uFn0vS4NeNvlfzHNu8H3u6YUnvbjxT5kxtVX_DRk1QnM3D5TiC0xCbAkw5wTvSGC4Lez23j6ZZIAhrXkdYhBKVl3O0aN.jpeg" alt=""/></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>One approach would be to build a unique inventory that fits your target niche but isn’t available on Airbnb. </p><p>Airbnb is already unbundling itself, and this trend is probably going to continue.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/work" target="_blank">Airbnb for Work</a> - accommodation for business travel</li><li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/luxury" target="_blank">Airbnb Luxe</a> - luxury villas </li><li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/plus" target="_blank">Airbnb Plus</a> - standardized high-quality homes</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Unbundling done right</strong></h3><p>Some projects are finding success, and I see a pattern emerging: build a unique inventory (by buying or leasing assets long term) and perfect the user experience:</p><ul role="list"><li>Upscale villas for remote workers: <a href="https://www.wander.com/" target="_blank">Wander</a></li><li>Tiny houses for a digital detox: <a href="https://unplugged.rest/" target="_blank">Unplugged</a></li><li>City apartments for business travelers: <a href="https://www.sonder.com/" target="_blank">Sonder</a></li><li>Mid-term room rentals in large cities: <a href="https://www.common.com/" target="_blank">Common</a></li><li>Affordable weekly rentals: <a href="https://www.padsplit.com/" target="_blank">Padsplit</a></li><li>Villas for creators: <a href="https://www.launchhouse.com/" target="_blank">Launch House</a>, <a href="https://www.creatorcabins.com/" target="_blank">Creator Cabins</a></li><li>Airstreams in national parks: <a href="https://autocamp.com/" target="_blank">Autocamp</a> </li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>So what are some new opportunities in unbundling Airbnb?</strong></p><p>Well, you can take any of these projects mentioned above and replicate them in different locations, make them in a different niche or add some twist. </p><ul role="list"><li>📍 Different location: They have only a few properties across California and Oregon but this concept can exist near any larger city with enough wealthy people </li><li>🔎 Different niche: Remove the Tesla, move from top locations, keep some amenities people love (e.g. Herman Miller chairs) and make it way more affordable</li><li>✨ Twist: Same as Wander but add only locations where you can do water sports</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>And of course, there are other niches that are not unbundled yet. I might go deeper into this topic in the next newsletters, but no promises.</p><p>If you liked Wander&#39;s concept, you might want to read about new <a href="https://www.peterfabor.com/posts/remote-work-hospitality" target="_blank">business opportunities in hospitality</a> that are emerging because of remote work.</p></div></div></div></div>
