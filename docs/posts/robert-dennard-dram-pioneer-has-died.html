    <h1>Robert Dennard, DRAM Pioneer, has died</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Robert Dennard, DRAM Pioneer, Dies at 91"><div><p><strong>Robert Dennard </strong></p><p>Inventor of Dynamic RAM </p><p>Fellow, 91; died 23 April</p><p>In 1967 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/thanks-for-the-memories" target="_self">Dennard</a> invented what is known as DRAM—a type of random-access semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data in a memory cell consisting of a tiny capacitor and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a>. </p><p>Before his invention, RAM required bulky, power-hungry components that were expensive to produce. His breakthrough paved the way for inexpensive, high-density, and commercially available memory.</p><p>The computing pioneer received the 2009 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-medal-of-honor/" target="_blank">IEEE Medal of Honor</a> for his innovation.</p><p>Dennard began his career as a staff engineer at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM</a>’s New York City research lab. He worked on new devices and circuits for logic and memory applications and developed advanced data communication techniques. </p><p>He was transferred in 1961 to IBM’s newly opened <a href="https://research.ibm.com/labs/watson/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Watson Research Center</a>, in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., where he worked on field-effect transistors and integrated circuits, using a six-transistor memory cell for each bit of data, the standard at the time. In 1968 Dennard successfully reduced a RAM cell to a small capacitor and a single field-effect transistor—the device that became known as DRAM. He was granted a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3387286A/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. patent</a> for his invention in 1968. </p><p>By the early 1970s, DRAM was standard in virtually all computers. A decade later, the device powered the first PCs—including the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ibm">IBM</a> 5150—allowing them to perform more complex operations.</p><p>After DRAM’s success, Dennard turned his attention to transistors. In 1972 he developed principles for scaling metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) devices, the main building block in low-power and high-performance very-large-scale integration (VLSI) chips. IEEE Fellow <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/50-years-of-moores-law/" target="_self">Gordon Moore</a> had predicted that the number of transistors on a chip would double every two years, but Dennard proposed that as transistors got smaller, their power consumption would remain nearly constant. He published his theory, now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dennard scaling</a>, with a set of supporting principles in the 1974 paper “<a href="http://stanford.edu/class/cs114/readings/dennard.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Design of Ion-Implanted MOSFETs With Very Small Physical Dimensions</a>.”</p><p>Dennard was named an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/ideasfromibm/us/ibm_fellows/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM Fellow</a> in 1979. For the next several decades at the company, he worked on metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, refining RAM and developing low-voltage, high-performance circuits. </p><p>During his career, he was honored with dozens of awards including the 2019 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-robert-n-noyce-medal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Robert N. Noyce Medal</a> and the 2001 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-edison-medal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Edison Medal</a>. In 1997 Dennard was inducted into the <a href="https://www.invent.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Inventors Hall of Fame</a>.</p><p>He received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering in 1954 and 1956 from <a href="https://www.smu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Southern Methodist University</a>, in Dallas. Two years later he earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now part of <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon</a>).</p><p><strong>Richard P. Schulz</strong></p><p>Power systems engineer</p><p>Life Fellow, 87; died 29 May</p><p><a href="https://www.donohuefuneralhome.com/obituaries/richard-schulz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Schulz</a> began his career in 1959 as a power systems engineer at <a href="https://www.ge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">General Electric</a> in Schenectady, N.Y. He worked there until 1987, when he joined <a href="https://www.aep.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Electric Power</a> in Columbus, Ohio. He retired in 2000 and became a consultant.</p><p>He specialized in power systems analysis. </p><p>Schulz, a member of the <a href="https://ieee-pes.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Power &amp; Energy Society</a>, authored or coauthored <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285469200" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">32 papers</a> on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/power-grid">power grid</a> testing reliability that were featured in IEEE publications.</p><p>He earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical and mechanical engineering in 1959 from <a href="https://www2.lehigh.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lehigh University</a>, in Bethlehem, Pa., and a master’s degree in 1966 from <a href="https://www.union.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Union College</a>, in Schenectady. </p><p><strong>C.
