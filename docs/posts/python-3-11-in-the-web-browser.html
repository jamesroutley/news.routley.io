                                <p>Python is ubiquitous, popular and runs almost everywhere – even on Mars. But there is one place that Python has not yet conquered: the browser. Python 3.11 may finally lay the foundation to make an old dream come true and have Python in the web browser.</p>
<p>In my talk I will explain how to cross-compile CPython 3.11 to Web Assembly and demonstrate how to run CPython in JavaScript engines. 
The talk will cover</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are some core developers and contributors working on Web Assembly port?</li>
<li>What is WASM and how do builds for browser, node, and WASI differ? What are the features and limitations of different WASM targets?</li>
<li>A short introduction to Python’s build system and how cross compiling works.</li>
<li>What problems did we run into and how did we have to modify CPython’s sources for WASM?</li>
<li>What is missing to make web browser support stable and usable in production?</li>
<li>A comparison to existing solutions like Pyodide.</li>
<li>What does WASM support mean for the community and PyPI packages?</li>
</ul>
