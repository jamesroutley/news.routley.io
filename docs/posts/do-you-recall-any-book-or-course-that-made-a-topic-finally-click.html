    <h1>Ask HN: Do you recall any book or course that made a topic finally click?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Sometimes it takes a book or a course (or explanation from a mentor) for a topic to finally click for you that you were struggling with for a long time.</p><p>For me, it was Stanford&#39;s EE261 course that made Fourier Transform click for me. Here is the link: <a href="https://see.stanford.edu/course/ee261" rel="nofollow">https://see.stanford.edu/course/ee261</a></p><p>Similarly for deep learning it was fast.ai courses.</p><p>For programming it was How to Design Programs at www.htdp.org.</p><p>Your topic of choice may be anything, not necessarily CS.</p></div></div></div>
