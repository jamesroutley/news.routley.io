	<div data-css="tve-u-16bd4337186"><div id="What-is-a-logline?" data-tag="h2"><h2>logline definition</h2><h3 spellcheck="false">1. What is a logline?</h3><p>A logline, or log line, is a brief (one to two sentence) summary of a movie, tv show, etc. that hooks the reader in and describes the central conflict of the story.</p><p>If someone asks you what your screenplay is about, respond with a logline. While we’ll get into what makes the best loglines pop and get our attention, it’s important to note that <strong>movie</strong> <strong>loglines are concise</strong>.</p><p>It&#39;s the most important part of a logline definition.</p><h5>LOGLINE VS SYNOPSIS</h5><p>While your logline is a short summary of what your movie is about, your synopsis is a beat for beat retelling of your story&#39;s plot.</p><p>Whether you&#39;re crafting a documentary logline or tinkering with loglines for short films, your logline is never the same as your synopsis.</p><h5>LOGLINE VS TAGLINE</h5><p>While your logline tells us what we&#39;re getting into, the tagline gets us excited and most always a play on words. <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/best-movie-taglines/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal" data-darkreader-inline-outline="">What&#39;s a tagline?</a></p><p>Using tv logline example, <em>Silicon Valley</em>, we&#39;d see that the logline is &#34;A shy silicon valley engineer tries to build his own company.&#34; While the tagline is &#34;He&#39;s got called company.&#34;</p></div><div data-tag="h2"><h2>Logline formula</h2><h3>Insert logline formula in your story</h3><p>While no two movie loglines are alike, inserting your story into logline template can give your project shape and keep you on track. Use the following formula to get you started:</p><p>When <strong>[INCITING INCIDENT]</strong> happens, <strong>[OUR PROTAGONIST]</strong> decides <strong>[TO DO ACTION]</strong> against <strong>[ANTAGONIST]</strong>.</p></div><div id="Strong-protagonists-make-strong-loglines" data-tag="h5"><h2>how to write a logline</h2><h3 spellcheck="false">2. Create strong protagonists</h3><p>A beautiful assassin. A hot-headed anchor. A culinary-gifted rat.</p><p>The first part of your logline should give us insight into <strong>who</strong> your movie is about.</p><p>While you have a great sense of your main character, it&#39;s important to focus on the key elements that make your character unique. Usually two conflicting adjectives can grab our attention as to who the protagonist is. </p><h5>DON&#39;T USE CHARACTER NAMES</h5><p>People didn&#39;t know who Ron Burgundy was before <em>Anchorman</em>...</p><p>The original logline for that project most likely read “A vain, super cool anchorman who is the epitome of 1970&#39;s American culture...etc.&#34; </p><p>Since your characters only exist in your mind&#39;s eye, it&#39;s important to really describe who your characters are.</p><h5>Napoleon Dynamite Example</h5><p><em>A listless and alienated teenager decides to help his new friend win the class presidency in their small western high school, all while he must deal with his bizarre family life back home.</em></p></div><div id="The-best-loglines-are-goals" data-tag="h5"><h2>writing loglines</h2><h3 spellcheck="false">3. The best loglines are goals</h3><p>Character studies are fun, but characters are only defined by the actions they take. A great logline sets up what the character wants--we’ll have to see if he or she achieves it. The best logline examples pose questions that we&#39;ll have to watch play out. </p><p>If you wrote a movie logline that stated, &#34;a man sets out to build a robot,&#34; it may be a goal, but it is a bit too bland, and possibly too broad.</p><p>That same logline can be strengthened by adding a specific, testable goal. &#34;A man sets out to build a robot to win a competition.&#34; Immediately, we can visualize a competition and a clear way to benchmark the protagonist&#39;s success.</p><h5 spellcheck="false">USE THE ACTIVE VOICE</h5><p>It’s no fun when something happens to us out of our control. That’s why we use the active voice.</p><p>While passive events can happen as inciting incident, the characters reaction can never be something s/he just has to do.</p><p>In the next logline, we see that there&#39;s a very clear goal for our main character and it&#39;s very easy to see whether or not he achieves it.</p><h5>Django Unchained Example</h5><p><em>With the help of a German bounty hunter, a freed slave sets out to rescue his wife from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner.</em></p></div><div id="Irony-is-your-friend" data-tag="h2"><h2>logline examples</h2><h3 spellcheck="false">4. Irony is your friend</h3><p>An airhead blonde goes to Harvard Law School.</p><p>A Christmas Elf goes to New York City.</p><p>Peruse any great logline examples, and you&#39;ll be sure to find irony. While irony is the bedrock of any comedy movie loglines, it also makes the protagonist&#39;s journey the hardest possible.</p><p>By pairing opposite personalities together and placing fish out of water, your story begins to take shape.</p><p>In <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, irony comes through as a serial killer is recruited to capture other serial killers.</p><h5 spellcheck="false"><strong>The Silence of the Lambs</strong></h5><p><em>A young F.B.I. cadet must confide in an incarcerated and manipulative killer to receive his help on catching another serial killer who skins his victims.</em></p></div><div id="Movie-loglines-should-have-stakes" data-tag="h2"><h2>heighten the stakes</h2><h3 spellcheck="false">5. Movie loglines should have stakes</h3><p>Is it the end of the world? Will a bomb explode? Is there a dastardly villain? <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/essential-principles-for-creating-the-ultimate-antagonist/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">How to create the ultimate villain</a> is no easy feat, but it&#39;s easier if you have strong stakes. </p><p>Stakes are great when coupled with a goal–when stakes are increased, it makes our desire to see the whole thing play out even greater.</p><p>Having stakes is the basis of how to write a logline. Consider the movie logline for the 1994 film, Speed.</p><p><em>A young police officer must prevent a bomb exploding aboard a city bus by keeping its speed above 50 mph.</em></p><p>Without &#34;by keeping its speed above 50 mph,&#34; this logline loses not only its stakes but also what keeps us invested in the plot.</p><h5>TRY USING A LOGLINE GENERATOR</h5><p>Maybe you’re stuck for ideas, either way, a generator is a cool way to brainstorm, but not end up with a final product. A logline generator can give direction for a character you want to write about, but any generator or formula will leave you with something lackluster.</p><h5>Star Wars: A New Hope</h5><p><em>Luke Skywalker, a spirited farm boy, joins rebel forces to save Princess Leia from the evil Darth Vader, and the galaxy from the Empire’s Death Star.</em></p></div><p><span><img alt="How to Write a Compelling Logline (with a Logline Examples) - Star Wars A New Hope" height="998" title="How to Write a Compelling Logline (with a Logline Examples) - Star Wars A New Hope" width="2114" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-lazy-type="image" data-lazy-src="https://s.studiobinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/How-to-Write-a-Compelling-Logline-with-a-Logline-Examples-Star-Wars-A-New-Hope.jpg.webp?resolution=1366,1&amp;resolution=2560,2" data-adaptive-images="true"/></span></p><p data-tag="h4"><h4>Write a Compelling Logline: Star Wars A New Hope</h4></p><div><p>Before we get to the next tip, what about TV show loglines? </p><p>Are they different? </p><p>Find out in this <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/tv-show-logline-examples/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">free masterclass on how to write a T.V. show logline.</a></p></div><div id="The-best-loglines-break-the-rules" data-tag="h2"><h2>more logline examples</h2><h3 spellcheck="false">6. The best loglines break the rules</h3><p>A producer&#39;s assistant will pore over loglines all day long to the point where they&#39;ll all read exactly the same.</p><p>While the tips we&#39;ve outlined should give you structure and direction, what makes movie loglines truly great is riffing on the conventional.</p><p>This Pirates of the Caribbean logline does just that. Although it states character names, it gets across character with careful placed quotation marks around the word &#34;Captain.&#34; It shifts the inciting incident half way through the logline. And most importantly, it delivers a twist right at the end of the sentence. </p><h5>HOW TO FIND THE ESSENCE OF MOVIE LOGLINES</h5><p>While getting across all the information we expect, your logline has to have the flavor of your film. To find the flavor, visualize what your film or show will look like. Knowing <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/shot-list-storyboard/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal" data-darkreader-inline-outline="">how to use storyboards</a>
will make this process much easier. </p><h5 spellcheck="false">Pirates of the Caribbean</h5><p><em>Blacksmith Will Turner teams up with eccentric pirate “Captain” Jack Sparrow to save his love, the governor’s daughter, from Jack’s former pirate allies, who are now undead.</em></p></div><div id="How-to-write-a-logline-that-kills" data-tag="h2"><h2>the best logline</h2><h3 spellcheck="false">7.
