    <h1>Airbnb removed my negative review</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I recently had a bad airbnb experience. During check in the host requested a cash deposit. this wasn&#39;t explained in the listing or prior to arrival. i couldn&#39;t check in and went elsewhere. Then i posted a review* giving these details.</p><p>Airbnb removed my below review because &#34;The review didnâ€™t have enough relevant information to help the Airbnb community make informed booking or hosting decisions.&#34;</p><p>The rating of the place went back up after removal. The host still have &#34;superhost&#34; status.</p><p>Needless to say, i no longer trust airbnb reviews.</p><p>*my full review was:</p><p>I wasn&#39;t able to check in because [Host] requested 300 USD security deposit during check in. I told her - I don&#39;t have that much cash on me. - That is against AirBnB rules. - This should have been explained in airbnb listing. She can&#39;t just surprise guests with this at the last minute. She didn&#39;t listen. She said: &#34;my house my rules&#34;, &#34;you can&#39;t tell me how to run my business&#34;, &#34;if you don&#39;t like it, you can cancel&#34;. I told her if i cancel, i don&#39;t get full refund so she should cancel. she said she won&#39;t cancel and me not getting refund is not her problem. I think she counts on the fact that guests typically wouldn&#39;t want to cancel in the last minute. you can see in some other reviews people had to agree to paying her this deposit. But i didn&#39;t want to cave in and called AirBnB. Thankfully, airbnb fully refunded the payment and i was able to find another accomodation in the last minute. I don&#39;t recommend this host unless you want a stressful start for your vacation.</p></div></div></div>
