    <h1>Ask HN: Why doesn&#39;t YC list compensation for their own open positions?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>HN, being a rather progressive forum, tends to trend in support of including compensation details for job posts, open positions, recruiter reach-outs, etc. This position [1] was just posted today and has been on the front page all day. Does anyone have any insider information or generally good theory as to why YC&#39;s own job posts include none of that information?<p>[1] <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/y-combinator/jobs/1x2BVnj-product-engineer-admissions" rel="nofollow">https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/y-combinator/jobs/1x2B...</a></p></td></div></div>
