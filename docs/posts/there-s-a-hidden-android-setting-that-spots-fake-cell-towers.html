<div><p>Most people never give a second thought to how their phone connects to a cell tower. It’s something that constantly happens in the background without our input, and therein lies the potential for trouble. What if that tower isn&#39;t what it seems? Android can tell you about it—maybe.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><h2 id="how-quot-stingrays-quot-hijack-your-connection">
                        How &#34;Stingrays&#34; hijack your connection
               </h2><p>Let’s get the scary stuff out of the way first. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_phone_tracker" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Stingrays</a>,” technically known as IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity) catchers, are devices primarily used for surveillance. They mimic cell towers and act as a middleman between your phone and the network. Once your device is tricked into connecting to what it believes to be a real cell tower, the attacker can harvest device information and force your phone onto an older, unencrypted protocol.</p>    <p>This is what allows them to listen to your calls or read your texts without you ever knowing something is wrong. It’s also possible for the attacker to harvest information from the phones of people nearby when this happens. While Stingrays have been used by law enforcement agencies for years to track suspects, it’s now much easier for malicious individuals to get their hands on them and skim data from innocent people.</p>

                									<p>You might think that switching from Facebook Messenger to old-fashioned text messages would help protect your privacy. But standard SMS text messages aren&#39;t very private or secure. SMS is like fax---an old, outdated standard that refuses to go away.</p>

                        Android’s line of defense
               </h2><p>The good news is that Google has been slowly building a wall against these attacks—emphasis on “slowly.” In 2021, Google released Android 12 with the ability to disable 2G connectivity. Stringrays like this network for its weak security. Two years later, it announced that Android 14 would support disabling an old form of encryption that makes it easy to intercept SMS and calls. Then Android 15 addressed Stingrays with the ability to notify the OS when a network requests your identifiers or forces you onto a less secure encryption method.</p>    <p>That brings us up to Android 16—the <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/345250/whats-the-latest-version-of-android/" target="_blank">latest version</a>. While all of those aforementioned features sounded great at the time, only one was actually available before last year: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/google-encourages-users-to-disable-2g-connectivity/" target="_blank">disabling 2G connectivity</a>. The hold-up is due to the fact that software can only do so much. For these security features to work, your phone&#39;s modem has to be able to communicate with the Android OS in a very specific way, and that’s just not something many Android phones have right now.</p>

<p>Because of this hardware requirement, the full suite of these network security tools is currently exclusive to the Pixel 10 series. They can be found under the “Mobile Network Security” section in the system settings. Even if you have a brand new Galaxy S25 running One UI 8/Android 16, you probably only have access to the 2G toggle (shown above). It’s better than nothing, but it’s not the complete picture.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><h2 id="how-to-enable-unencrypted-network-notifications">
                        How to enable unencrypted network notifications
               </h2><p>If you do happen to use a Pixel 10, it’s very easy to enable the extra network security. Google doesn’t enable them by default. Open the Settings and navigate to Security &amp; privacy &gt; More security &amp; privacy &gt; Mobile network security. Inside, you’ll see two toggles:</p>        <ul>
                    <li>
                                        <strong>Network notifications:</strong> When enabled, you’ll be notified when your phone connects to an unencrypted network, or when a network records your device information or SIM ID. This is the setting that would alert you when connecting to a Stingray.
                        </li>
                    <li>
                                        <strong>2G network protection: </strong>Enabling this toggle simply blocks your phone from connecting to a 2G network.
                        </li>
            </ul>


                            
            
    
<p>Should one of the scenarios mentioned in “Network notifications” occur, you’ll <a href="https://hear-me.social/@Jerry/115132142737818365" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">get an alert</a> that says you’ve connected to an unencrypted network and your data is vulnerable. Alerts can also tell you if your device’s information was recorded, including the time it happened and how often it’s been happening.</p>    
                
    
    
    
                
    
                
                
                
        
                                                            
                                                                                                                        
                            
    
    

    
    
<p>These notifications can be invaluable in protecting yourself, and enabling them is more important than ever. It’s unfortunate that the vast majority of Android devices still only have the 2G toggle. The Pixel 10 series was released late last year, so hopefully 2026 brings more Android phones that ship with the required hardware for the Mobile Network Security suite. Fake cell towers may sound like something from a spy movie, but it’s the reality we live in.</p>
