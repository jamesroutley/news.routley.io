        <p>September  2, 2022 at 11:03 AM by Dr. Drang</p>
        <p>I was listening to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2022/08/31/ep-356">the most recent episode</a> of <em>The Talk Show</em> this morning, and my extremely important contribution to Markdown came up. Sort of.</p>

<p>Rosemary Orchard is the guest, and she does a great job with the single most important task of a <em>Talk Show</em> guest: staying engaged and making relevant contributions while Gruber is on a long digression. Lots of guests find it hard to balance letting Gruber go while also making sure the audience knows you’re still there. Rosemary does this perfectly.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was during a digression—actually a digression within a digression— that Gruber talks about code blocks in Markdown and how one of his favorite features is that you don’t have to escape anything in a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#precode">code block</a>. You can paste source code directly into your Markdown document without any changes, and it will appear as expected in the rendered HTML.<sup id="fnref:block"><a href="#fn:block" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> That’s my doing.</p>

<p>In 2004, any code that contained backslashes (<code>\</code>) was likely to need some editing when placed in a Markdown code block. Backslashes weren’t treated literally within a code block; they acted as escape characters and made the output look different from the input. Very un-Markdown-ish.</p>

<p>I pointed this out in the Markdown mailing list, and Gruber agreed that it should be changed. In the next Markdown release—which was, I believe, his last—he made the change, and all the text in code blocks has been treated literally ever since.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, as Markdown became more popular, someone else would have pointed out this problem. Gruber himself would have been annoyed by it if he ever needed to write a code block with backslashes in it. But I was there first. And you’re welcome.</p>
