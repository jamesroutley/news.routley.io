                <div><p>Arguably one of the biggest challenges for desktop security is how to handle those overly complex PDFs, DOCs, and similar files, that are so often exchanged by people, or downloaded from the Web, and that often provide a way for the attacker to <a href="http://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/analyzing-the-first-rop-only-sandbox-escaping-pdf-exploit">compromise</a> the user&#39;s desktop system.</p></div><p>Today I would like to discuss a recent innovation we created for Qubes OS that allows to securely convert those pesky PDFs (as well as essentially any graphics files) into <i>trusted</i><span> PDFs. Here by a “trusted PDF” I mean a file that should be </span><i>harmless</i><span>to the user&#39;s system, so, a non-malicious PDF.</span></p><p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dno9bFVAjPk/USY0jfl3-WI/AAAAAAAAAKE/4WzqMREkWSc/s1600/r2b2-converting-pdf-2.png" imageanchor="1"><img height="180" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dno9bFVAjPk/USY0jfl3-WI/AAAAAAAAAKE/4WzqMREkWSc/s320/r2b2-converting-pdf-2.png" width="320"/></a></p><span>A few years ago, we have already introduced a mechanism in Qubes OS called <a href="http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2010/06/disposable-vms.html">Disposable VMs</a>, that can be used to </span><i>safely</i><span>open any file, including PDFs, DOCs, etc. The file is being opened in a... well a dedicated disposable VM that is created within seconds (typically below 5 seconds) and all the file processing and rendering happens inside this VM. Once the document is closed, the disposable VM is automatically destroyed, and any changes to the file (e.g. if the was an editable DOC file) are automatically propagated back into the original file. This mechanism is very powerful, and I often use it for my daily work. However, it surely is a bit cumbersome – who wants to wait 5 seconds for the PDF to open, especially if I have a dozen of invoices to look through! So, today I present an alternative approach...</span></article>
