You might call a friend or family member who was handy in the kitchen, or hope that a cookbook at home had some instructions. Or, unsure of where to look for the answer at all, you’d just grab a kitchen knife and do your best.</p><p data-block-key="dia2d">Twenty-five years ago we launched Google Search to help you find answers to questions big and small. Since then, billions of people have turned to our products to do just that — to satisfy their curiosity. To start a business. To start a journey. To cut a pineapple.</p></div>

We may be a technology company, but Google is what it is today because of people: Our employees, our partners, and most importantly, all the people who use our products.</p><p data-block-key="5m1bn">So as we celebrate our 25th birthday today, we’re also celebrating 25 years of your curiosity. After all, your curiosity is what has fueled us — and our progress. Consider that in 2000 so many people rushed to Google seeking photos of Jennifer Lopez’s daring Grammy’s dress that it became the most popular search query. That search returned 10 blue links, but no green dress. So our engineers went to work, brainstorming new ways to index images alongside webpages and <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/25-biggest-google-search-updates/">Google Images was born</a>, enabling you to find that one photo you’re in search of faster than ever before.</p></div>
