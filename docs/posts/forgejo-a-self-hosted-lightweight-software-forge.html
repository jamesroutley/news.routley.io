        <p>I just realized that I haven’t blogged in four years, so it will be a while before my blog catches up with me. I feel like I am a different person now… Okay, I’ll get to the topic I was excited to write about.</p>
<h3 id="first-look">First look</h3>
<p>The first time I saw AI-assisted software development was a demo of a project called <a href="https://www.all-hands.dev">all hands</a> . I was amazed that LLMs (large language models) could read bug reports from screenshots, fix and test code, and then deploy the changes too. It looked so voodoo to me. Soon I found out that this was becoming commonplace with most of the popular LLMs.</p>
<h3 id="enter-sundai-and-more">Enter SunDAI, and more</h3>
<p>Then I happened to find out about the <a href="https://www.sundai.club">SunDAI club</a> which builds and launches web apps using AI tools, almost every Sunday. This coincided with my resignation from my job - I was planning to take a career break in order to start my own company. I put myself on the club’s waitlist, and after a couple of months I was invited.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I had quit my job and had started playing with <a href="https://www.cursor.com">Cursor</a>, the leading AI code editor. I liked it. Before I used it a lot, I heard about <a href="https://codeium.com/windsurf">Windsurf</a> from the SunDAI folks and gave it a shot. The experience was so good I never stopped using it. In fact, I am typing this blog in Windsurf now. I even made changes to the blog’s appearance using it.</p>
<h3 id="four-weeks-of-ai-assisted-coding">Four weeks of AI-assisted coding</h3>
<p>In the last four weeks, I have</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed the appearance of one of my websites on mobile screens</li>
<li>developed three nextjs apps without any experience with React or nextjs</li>
<li>wrote a python web app for classifying my Gmail messages</li>
<li>tried out in-browser 2-d and 3-d game development</li>
<li>experimented with multiple AI models available on <a href="https://www.replicate.com">replicate</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have only used AI for coding - okay maybe 99.9% of the time. There were times when I had to correct the code manually. But it was rare. Most of the times, AI can write fresh code, understand existing code, try out code changes, iterate over different approaches.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-of-programming">The future of programming</h3>
<p>In short, an AI coding agent is like a junior or mid-level engineer you have employed. I know it sounds futuristic and maybe foolish. But I have two decades of software engineering experience and today I believe nobody should be required to write code by hand. Just like compilers and high-level programming languages removed the need for writing machine code using a processor’s native instruction set.</p>
<p>Mind you, programming languages will be there and will continue to evolve. We just invented a higher-level abstraction, called an AI prompt. The history of programming languages is full of examples of a higher-level abstraction helping us ‘move up the ladder’. I think most of the software engineers tomorrow will become prompt engineers.</p>
