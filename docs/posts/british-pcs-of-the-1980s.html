<p>If you grew up in America, the early history of home computers in the UK might not be familiar to you. But Great Britain produced innovative personal computers that were as equally successful and influential as their counterparts from Atari, Commodore, and Radio Shack in the United States.</p>

<p>To gain insight into the 1980s British PC landscape, we consulted veteran British game developer <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/15966/kevin-edwards/">Kevin Edwards</a>, who helped us identify the top seven most significant platforms.</p>
<p>Having worked on over 40 games released between <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/48469/atomic-protector/">1983</a> and 2022, Edwards developed titles such as <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/36086/wolverine/"><em>Wolverine</em></a> for the NES, <em>Ken Griffy Jr. Baseball</em> for the Super Nintendo, and many games in the Lego Star Wars series. In fact, his first game, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/48469/atomic-protector/"><em>Atomic Protector</em></a>, debuted for the BBC Micro 40 years ago.</p>
<h2>Sinclair ZX81 (1981)</h2>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zx81.jpg" data-height="902" data-width="1297" alt="A Sinclair ZX81 computer advertisement."><img alt="A Sinclair ZX81 computer advertisement." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zx81-640x445.jpg" width="640" height="445" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zx81-1280x890.jpg 2x"/></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zx81.jpg" data-height="902" data-width="1297">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> A Sinclair ZX81 computer advertisement.</p><p>Sinclair Research</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a follow-up to the pioneering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX80">ZX80</a>, the Sinclair ZX81 continued Sinclair&#39;s trend of making computing accessible to the masses with its low price and simple design. Developed by a firm founded by British inventor <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/rip-sir-clive-sinclair-creator-of-uks-famed-zx-spectrum-gaming-computer/">Sir Clive Sinclair</a>, the ZX81 sold in kit or pre-assembled form. It featured a 3.25 MHz Z80 CPU, 1KB of RAM, and a built-in BASIC programming language.</p>
<p>Despite its black and white graphics and flat membrane keyboard, the ZX81 sold over 1.5 million units. Notable software for the ZX81 includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Monster_Maze"><em>3D Monster Maze</em></a>, a pioneering first-person 3D game, and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Simulation_(Psion_software)">Flight Simulation</a></em>, one of the earliest flight simulators. &#34;The ZX81 was one of the first and most popular home computers,&#34; Kevin Edwards said. &#34;Very affordable, and they gave many people their first taste of using a real computer.&#34;</p>
<p>In 1982, after a brief stint under its original name in the &#39;States, the ZX81 re-emerged in the US as the <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/477/retro-scan-of-the-week-wheres-the-bits">Timex-Sinclair 1000</a>, which the company marketed as &#34;the first personal computer under $100.&#34;</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>BBC Micro (1981)</h2>

<p>Acorn Computers, in partnership with the British Broadcasting Corporation, developed the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/07/uk-museum-seeks-bbc-micro-experts-to-help-maintain-its-classic-80s-pcs/">BBC Micro</a> with the goal of promoting computer literacy and programming skills in the UK. With over 1.5 million units sold, it was a great success. &#34;The BBC Micro was massive in schools, colleges, and universities,&#34; Edwards said.</p>

<p>The BBC Micro featured a 2 MHz 6502 CPU and a range of configurations from 16KB to 128KB of RAM. Over the years, developers such as Edwards created a rich software library for the platform, including educational software and the highly influential space trading game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)"><em>Elite</em></a>, which introduced 3D graphics and liberating open-ended gameplay to a generation of British gamers.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Fourth Dimension Systems launched a limited release of the BBC Micro <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/657/retro-scan-of-the-week-the-bbc-microcomputer">in the US</a> in 1983, but it failed to impact the heavily competitive American PC marketplace.</p>
<h2>Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K (1982)</h2>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zx_spectrum.jpg" data-height="1408" data-width="2048" alt="An advertisement for the Sinclair Spectrum 48K personal computer."><img alt="An advertisement for the Sinclair Spectrum 48K personal computer." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zx_spectrum-640x440.jpg" width="640" height="440" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zx_spectrum-1280x880.jpg 2x"/></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zx_spectrum.jpg" data-height="1408" data-width="2048">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> An advertisement for the Sinclair Spectrum 48K personal computer.</p><p>Sinclair Research</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Following the success of the ZX81, Sinclair Research released the ZX Spectrum, which represented an even bigger UK blockbuster for Sinclair with over 5 million units sold. It featured a 3.5 MHz Zilog Z80A CPU, 48KB of RAM, and color graphics, making it an excellent and enduring platform for games and educational software. The &#34;Speccy,&#34; as it&#39;s often nicknamed, inspired both a series of official follow-up machines and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ZX_Spectrum_clones">unauthorized clones</a> released all over the world.</p>

<p>&#34;The Spectrum was popular because of the great selection of games that were written for it,&#34; said Edwards. Notable games—almost all of which shipped on cassette tape—include the iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Willy"><em>Jet Set Willy</em></a> and <em>Manic Miner</em>, both of which helped define the genre in the UK. And always remember, Americans: it&#39;s pronounced &#34;zed-ex Spectrum,&#34; owing to how Britons <a href="https://proofed.com/writing-tips/is-the-letter-z-pronounced-zee-or-zed/">pronounce</a> the letter Z.</p>
<p>In 1983, the ZX Spectrum came to the US in heavily modified form as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_2068">Timex-Sinclair 2068</a>, although it fared very poorly in the market.</p>
