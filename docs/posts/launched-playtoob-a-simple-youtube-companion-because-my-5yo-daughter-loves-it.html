                                <p>No algorithms. No suggestions. You&#39;re in command.</p>
                                <p>Sort by Date, Most Liked, Most Viewed.</p>
                                <p>Filter by channel, by recency, and more, soon.</p>
                                <p>What you love. What you choose.</p>
                                <p>Also: Shorts, out. Restricted, out. Live, out.</p>
                                <p>You already have Youtube for those.</p>
                                <hr/>
                                <p>Now <b>you have something ready to watch</b> while you eat.</p>
                                <p>Now <b>you can leave your kid to watch</b> whatever <em>you</em> choose.</p>
                                <hr/>
                                <p>Just, try out yourself, <b>membership is free</b>.</p>
                                <p>Only if you want more, you pay a small fee.</p>
