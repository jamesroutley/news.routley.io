    <h1>Video game workers in North America now have an industry-wide union</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s now an industry-wide union for video game workers in the US and Canada. The United Videogame Workers-CWA (UVW-CWA) has a mission to bring together &#34;artists, writers, designers, QA testers, programmers, freelancers and beyond to build worker power irrespective of studio and current job status.&#34;</p><p>The union <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/video-game-labor-at-a-crossroads-new-pathways-to-industry-wide-organizing-presented-by-communications-workers-of-america/911830" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:makes its official debut;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">makes its official debut</a> at the &#34;Video Game Labor at a Crossroads: New Pathways to Industry-Wide Organizing&#34; panel at GDC.

As a matter of fact, the first major issue the union seeks to address is layoffs, given that <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.aol.com/one-10-video-game-developers-170000293.html" data-ylk="slk:one in ten developers;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">one in ten developers</a> were shown the door in 2024.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="A pamphlet." data-src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/N1yMtw876Xr8uTArJ2lUrw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTk1Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/17c0f890-00f7-11f0-adfb-edb00754b7dd" height="490" width="492"/></p></div></div><p><figcaption><span> UVW-CWA</span></figcaption></p></figure><p>Workers will also be passing around a zine that includes the organization’s mission statement, FAQs and an op-ed. This is a direct-join union, meaning that workers can sign up on their own. This allows folks to bypass traditional unionization processes like elections and employer consent.</p><p>We aren’t sure if this will catch on throughout the industry or if major publishers will recognize the union. However, it’s just the latest salvo in the ongoing battle between industry workers and corporate bigwigs.
