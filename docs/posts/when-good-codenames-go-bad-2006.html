	<h2><a href="https://aarongiles.com/old/?p=186">When Good Codenames Go Bad</a></h2>
		
		<p>
		I&#39;ll admit it: I&#39;ve never been good at coming up with codenames for projects. 
		Sure, I&#39;ve worked on projects with good codenames (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Game_Station">Virtual 
		Game Station</a> was codenamed <b>Bonestorm</b>, but you can thank <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Traut" target="blank">Eric</a> for that one). But they&#39;re usually not of my invention.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Except once.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		When we were starting work on the first Windows version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_PC">Virtual 
		PC</a>, we were brainstorming codenames. Nothing was really clicking. Finally, 
		someone suggested, &#34;Well Aaron&#39;s the lead, he should pick the name.&#34; Great. 
		Off the top of my head I scrambled and threw out <b>Hedgehog</b>. Not a 
		particularly exciting or descriptive codename, but not an entirely terrible 
		one, either. It stuck. In fact, we even used Hedgehog as the root directory 
		name of our source control tree (this was before we really realized what 
		a bad idea this is, since you&#39;re generally stuck with it at that point 
		without some major reshuffling).
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Over time, the name grew on me, and on the rest of the team. Turned out 
		to be a pretty good codename after all. As we went through our planning 
		phase for Virtual PC for Windows, we decided to rearchitect the core Virtual 
		PC code so that we could share as much code as possible between the Mac 
		and Windows versions. Furthermore, planning ahead, we realized that we 
		were going to want to consider developing a version of Virtual PC to run 
		on Linux platforms. And we were going to want to craft a new Mac version 
		that ran on MacOS X, which hadn&#39;t been released yet.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		All of these projects needed codenames. And so, with a bit of cleverness, 
		Hedgehog begat <b>Warthog</b> (VPC for Linux) and <b>Groundhog</b> (VPC 
		for MacOS X). Of course, we still needed to produce a &#34;classic&#34; MacOS 9 
		version as well. Since that one had been around since the beginning, it 
		was dubbed <b>Boss Hogg</b>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Conveniently, referring to the whole collection, we could just talk about 
		the <b>whole hog</b>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		After we had produced Virtual PC for Windows, we hooked up with Microsoft 
		to produce a variant of Virtual PC for Windows that would serve as the 
		emulation platform for Windows CE development. This was sort of a stripped-down, 
		mini version of VPC Windows. It was given the codename <b>Piglet</b>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		By now, we had pretty much achieved a state of doneness with the whole 
		hog theme. Or so I thought.<!--more--></p>
		
		<p>
		Okay, at this point, all the developers were really done. A moratorium 
		was placed on pork-related codenames. We would come up with a new theme. 
		We began to start talking about what our future products might be. We began 
		development on Virtual Server, and studiously avoided using codenames at 
		all.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Sadly, our project managers did not get the memo. Looking forward, we thought 
		about supporting multiple processors in a virtual PC, and maybe even developing 
		an Itanium-based version. The codenames for these two projects?
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>Snowball</b> and <b>Napoleon</b>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Strangely, nobody has ever asked me to come up with a codename since then. 
		I wonder why?
