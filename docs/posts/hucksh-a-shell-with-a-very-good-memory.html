    <h1>Show HN: Hucksh â€“ A shell with a very good memory</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>In the deep mists of time (circa 2012), I was playing with the Go standard library, and saw how easy it was to stand up a webserver that let you navigate a remote file system, and I thought it was pretty neat.</p><p>I took a look at my shell history and a frequent pattern of commands was &#34;cd, ls, cd, ls, ...&#34;. And I thought &#34;I love my keyboard, but you know, point and click might be nice in this context.&#34;</p><p>And then I thought, &#34;It&#39;d be even cooler if you could run commands there.&#34;</p><p>Skip forward several years, a few earlier implementations, a name change, and now there&#39;s Hucksh(ell), a bash-like shell that makes it easy to do all that.</p><p>There&#39;s a directory navigation tab, where you can click around to navigate, use forward and back buttons (like a browser), and also a &#34;navigate&#34; mode where you can select the directory to change to with a single keystroke.</p><p>The system remembers every directory you do anything in and lets you choose them from a list, which you can order by name, time last used, or frequency of use.</p><p>And finally, of course, there are shell tabs where you can run individual commands.</p><p>Each command gets its own widget in the UI, separate from the others, in its own tty, with no overlap.</p><p>The system saves each command you run, along with its start &amp; stop times, the directory you were in, the result code when it finishes, and (this is the fun part) the command output, all in a sqlite database, on disk. (Disk is cheap, yeah? Might as well do something with it.)</p><p>This allows you to do some neat things with history and context.</p><p>* Keep the same tab open forever, maintaining months or years of context and history</p><p>* Pick up where you left off a month or a year ago</p><p>* Pick up where you left off after a system restart (like when you restart your browser and it reopens all your windows and tabs)</p><p>* Review everything you&#39;ve done in a project directory</p><p>* Review everything you did yesterday, or a month ago</p><p>I hope in the future to make it easy to share history, which could help with new employee onboarding, teaching, asking or answering questions on StackOverflow, documenting a penetration test, or anywhere else you want to easily share your work or consume someone else&#39;s work.</p><p>Everything is in Go.</p><p>* The front-end uses Gio UI, a cross-platform GUI for Go</p><p>* The shell itself is <a href="https://github.com/mvdan/sh">https://github.com/mvdan/sh</a>, a bash-like command interpreter</p><p>* The terminal emulator is a fork of Darktile (<a href="https://github.com/liamg/darktile">https://github.com/liamg/darktile</a>) with very few changes.</p><p>This is not a SaaS. You download code and run the front- and back-end yourself, like ssh/sshd. (Except it doesn&#39;t run as root.)</p><p>This is a commercial product. Without a license, the app limits you to a single top-level window, with two shell tabs. (Similar to a single iTerm window with two tabs.) With a license, as many windows and tabs as you like.</p><p>I&#39;m looking for any kind of feedback whatsoever, positive or negative, from the app itself, to the documentation and other online information, to this very post.</p><p>hucksh is currently available for macOS and Linux.</p><p>Learn more: <a href="https://huckridge.notion.site/Hucksh-overview-2fdcaf7d639145c0b192d0e19d7c25e4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://huckridge.notion.site/Hucksh-overview-2fdcaf7d639145...</a></p><p>Download, etc: <a href="https://huckridge.notion.site/Hucksh-online-download-purchase-newsletter-Discord-etc-fb2f61b44e8e47ebaf011065937f9454" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://huckridge.notion.site/Hucksh-online-download-purchas...</a></p></div></td></div></div>
