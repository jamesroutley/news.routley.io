    <h1>Integers in C quiz</h1>

        A long time ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/johnregehr">John Regehr</a> wrote a very nice quiz about C integers. He&#39;s a pretty awesome expert on undefined behavior and this quiz highlights the type of stuff you need to know when auditing C code. A lot of times youâ€™ll run into really strange scenarios which end up causing exploitable bugs later in the code.

        The original version was taken down long ago for reasons of WordPress compatability. I&#39;ve taken an archival version and wrapped it in simple JavaScript that should work on all browsers.
        </p>
		<p>A few clarification that came up from Twitter threads and reddit.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>All other things being equal, assume GCC/LLVM x86/x64 implementation-defined behaviors.</li>
		</ul>
