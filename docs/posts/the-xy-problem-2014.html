    <h1>The XY Problem (2014)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>The XY problem is asking about your attempted <i>solution</i> rather than your actual <i>problem</i>. This leads to enormous amounts of wasted time and energy, both on the part of people asking for help, and on the part of those providing help.</p>
<ul>
<li>User wants to do X.</li>
<li>User doesn&#39;t know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y.</li>
<li>User doesn&#39;t know how to do Y either.</li>
<li>User asks for help with Y.</li>
<li>Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.</li>
<li>After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn&#39;t even a suitable solution for X.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem occurs when people get stuck on what they believe is the solution and are unable step back and explain the issue in full.</p>
<h2>What to do about it?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Always include information about a broader picture along with any attempted solution.</li>
<li>If someone asks for more information, do provide details.</li>
<li>If there are other solutions you&#39;ve already ruled out, share why you&#39;ve ruled them out. This gives more information about your requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that if your diagnostic theories were accurate, you wouldn&#39;t be asking for help right?</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>
n00b doesn&#39;t actually want the last 3 chracters in a filename, he wants the file extensions, so why ask for the last 3 characters?
</p>
<p>
&lt;n00b&gt; How can I echo the last three characters in a filename?</p>
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>
If Angela had just started by explaining she wants to prevent others from detecting her OS, this could have been a much shorter and more productive discussion.
</p>
<p>
Angela: &#39;nmap -O -A 127.0.0.1&#39; returns some lines starting with &#39;OS:&#39;. How to change it?</p>
