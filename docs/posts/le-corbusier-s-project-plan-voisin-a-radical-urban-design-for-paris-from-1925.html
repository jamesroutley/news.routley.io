Instead of narrow streets and the city’s fragmented, additive and varied structure, uniform high-rises at the business districts, big apartment blocks in the residential areas and a motor highway network would dominate the skyline of Paris today.</p><p>The rows of giant housing blocks, the Unités, would be surrounded by large parks, the dominant office towers would rise tall behind the trees.</p><p>Even though Le Corbusier&#39;s proposal seems completely wrong and devastating from today&#39;s perspective, it has indescribable strength.</p><p>exhibited at Sagmeister &amp; Walsh: Beauty </p><p>Film Stills:</p>
