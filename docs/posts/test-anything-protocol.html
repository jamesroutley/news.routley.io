<p>TAP, the Test Anything Protocol, is a simple text-based interface between testing modules in a test harness. It decouples the reporting of errors from the presentation of the reports.</p>

<p>One of its major uses is for noise reduction; when you have a suite of many tests, making them TAP producers and using a TAP consumer to view them helps ensures that you will see everything you need to notice and diagnose breakage without being distracted by a flood of irrelevant success messages. It can assist other forms of analysis and statistics-gathering as well.</p>

<p>TAP started life as part of the test harness for Perl but now has implementations in C, C++, Python, PHP, Perl, Java, JavaScript, Go, Rust, and others.  Consumers and producers do not have to be written in the same language to interoperate.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what a TAP test stream looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1..4
ok 1 - Input file opened
not ok 2 - First line of the input valid
ok 3 - Read the rest of the file
not ok 4 - Summarized correctly # TODO Not written yet
</code></pre></div></div>
