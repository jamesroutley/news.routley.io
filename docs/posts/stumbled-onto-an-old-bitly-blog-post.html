    <h1>Stumbled onto an old Bitly blog post</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>I had forgotten that I wrote this 10 years ago while I worked at Bitly.
Looks like the old Bitly tech blog isn&#39;t much maintained, but there&#39;s still
some gems there:</p>
<p><a href="https://word.bitly.com/post/69080588278/logging-locals" rel="nofollow">Getting more clues from Pythonâ€™s logging module</a></p>
<p>Not a bad little article.
Nowadays we tend to rely more on third-party tools like Datadog
which sometimes offer similar functionality out of the box,
but sometimes you might end up rolling your own.</p>
<h2>Other fun Bitly posts</h2>
<p>While there I ran into some other old goodies:</p>
<p><a href="https://word.bitly.com/post/74069870671/optimizing-text-processing" rel="nofollow">Adventures in Optimizing Text Processing</a>
- by my old tech lead Michael Richman. I remember working on some of those
Hadoop jobs!</p>
<p><a href="https://word.bitly.com/post/28558800777/dablooms-an-open-source-scalable-counting" rel="nofollow">dablooms</a> -
a cool approach to solving spam at scale.</p>
<p><a href="https://word.bitly.com/post/21721687297/clickatron" rel="nofollow">Metrics - Building
Clickatron</a>
and <a href="https://word.bitly.com/post/20350137230/sortdb" rel="nofollow">sortdb - static key value database</a>
- I can tell you that clickatron was a bit weird to work with as a developer
writing queries against it, but it&#39;s really
impressive how Bitly was able to build a metrics system that scaled to 100
billion data points (as of 2012) with such a small dev and infrastructure team. There really was nothing
suitable off the shelf at the time, so they had to invent it. Some of the choices made were things I
found really shocking at the time... what do you mean, you built a timeseries
database that large out of plain text files? And you rebuild the entire database from
scratch every night? Wat? But it worked well!</p>
