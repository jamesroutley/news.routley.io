<ul>
<li>i was about to say last week feels like 50 years ago, writing this wise at least, but i forgot that i did <a href="https://olu.online/25-hopes-for-2025/">25 hopes for 2025</a> last week! so never mind, time is moving at the usual pace.</li>
<li>i posted my first short video! i want to record video replies to some of the comments, short video is hard, but in such a different way to long! other inane comments! but yeah, getting used to it!</li>
<li>went to longsword; it was hard and i nearly cried but i rallied and many of my friends made the good points that i have:
a. done nothing like it before,
b. am completely new to the sport and,
c. (through z) can just do things for fun even if i&#39;m not amazing at them, it&#39;s not like i want to become a sword professional.
good points friends!</li>
<li>i went to see <a href="http://parktheatre.co.uk/event/cyrano/">cyrano</a>, cried a bit. it was very good; queer silly sexy romantic fun.</li>
<li>trying to get a bit more into tarot; a friend reminded me of <a href="https://moonlight.world">moonlight</a> so if you want to do some collaborative reading or you feel more confident with reading than me, <a href="https://olu.online/contact">hit me up</a>!</li>
<li>i am reading too many books at once and need to prioritise but i want to finish everything lol! i am reading blood in the machine (about luddites), tech agnostic (about how big tech is a religion), the power of ritual (secular rituals), no bad parts (ifs therapy book) and survival is a promise (audre lorde biography).</li>
<li>online i&#39;m reading about <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup">facebook and genocide</a>; heavy trigger warnings for death, as well as physical and sexual violence.</li>
<li>watching videos about internet in Cuba, and realising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paquete_Semanal">el paquete</a> is probably not as much of a thing any more? correct me if i&#39;m wrong.</li>
<li>eating the last of the christmas cake, mixed shwarma wraps, bbq beef hula hoops, and mentos.</li>
<li>been really focused on work and applying for things &#34;content creator&#34;-focused opportunities, so maybe a bit of a sedate weeknotes! thank you all for reading and hope you&#39;re having a great 2025 so far.</li>
