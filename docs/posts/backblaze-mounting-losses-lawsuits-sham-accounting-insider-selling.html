    <h1>Backblaze: Mounting Losses, Lawsuits, Sham Accounting, Insider Selling</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ul><li>Backblaze (NASDAQ:BLZE) is a $250 million cloud storage and backup solution provider based in California that operates through two business segments: B2 Cloud Storage allowing “customers to store data” and “developers to build applications,” and Computer Backup that “automatically backs up data” from devices for “virtually unlimited” storage. </li><li>Since its November 2021 IPO, Backblaze has reported losses every quarter, its outstanding share count has grown by 80%, and its share price has declined by 71%.</li><li>In October 2024, two former senior employees filed suit against Backblaze, alleging accounting fraud, inflated projections, and whistleblower retaliation. One lawsuit was filed by Backblaze’s former Vice President (“VP”) of Investor Relations, James Kisner, while the other was filed by former Senior Director of Financial Planning &amp; Analysis (“FP&amp;A”), Huey Hall.</li><li>As soon as Backblaze’s IPO lock-up expired in April 2022, its founders engaged in an aggressive trading plan to sell 10,000 shares a day, along with other potential sales from early employee holders, against “all external capital markets advice” related to the downward pressure that these sales would put on Backblaze’s thinly-traded shares, according to the complaints from the 2 former senior employees.</li><li>A capital markets consultant warned Backblaze management that the trading plan was “likely breaching its fiduciary duties,” while Backblaze’s VP of Investors Relations warned that the plan could have a “meaningful negative impact on the business,” according to one of the lawsuits. The founders proceeded anyway, driving the stock down to $3.82 by the end of November 2022— 76% lower than its IPO price.</li><li>4 months into selling his shares, Backblaze co-founder &amp; CTO Brian Wilson wrote in an internal email, “if BLZE goes straight down to zero, each day I sold was beyond totally justified and I won’t regret it” shortly before resigning amidst continued share sales, according to Backblaze’s former VP of Investor Relations. </li><li>To keep its stock price afloat, Backblaze pressured employees to certify &#34;inaccurate&#34; financial statements, according to former Director of FP&amp;A Hall.</li><li>Backblaze’s former Senior Director of FP&amp;A, Huey Hall, claims he refused to sign off on the company’s financial reports on “at least three separate written occasions,” including its 2022 annual report, because he knew there were “misstatements regarding the Fixed Assets, Capitalized R&amp;D, Cash Flow statements, and Equity accounting,” per his lawsuit.</li><li>The claims of inaccurate financials were corroborated by Backblaze’s former VP of Investor Relations, James Kisner, in his complaint. According to Kisner, in 2023 Backblaze’s CFO sent “highly inflated cash flow forecasts to auditors” so that Backblaze could “pass the ‘going concern’ opinion provided by auditors.” </li><li>Kisner alerted the board to the allegedly “fraudulent” forecast, which resulted in an internal investigation that was never disclosed to shareholders. His lawsuit states: “Kisner reasonably believes that the fraudulent, inflated cash flow forecasts if presented to BDO and the SEC would be a violation of law.” Certain founders continued selling shares when these allegations were made, and while the internal investigation allegedly took place.</li><li>Against the backdrop of this alleged financial manipulation, multiple senior leaders from Backblaze resigned and concocted a plan to “obscure the sales” of their shares by waiting 61 days from resignation to avoid having to file their sales publicly, per Kisner, the former VP of Investor Relations. Backblaze’s General Counsel, Tom MacMitchell, expressed concern that the obscured sales could have a “very dramatic impact” on Backblaze’s stock price due to the “large pent up demand to liquidate.”</li><li>Backblaze CEO Gleb Budman has repeatedly stressed “transparency,” and in Q2 2023 he cancelled his personal trading plan in an apparent display of confidence in the business. Yet, 6 months after this announcement, he sold $1.6 million of stock while in possession of material non-public information related to the imminent resignation of Backblaze’s CFO, per the former VP of Investor Relations complaint. The stock tumbled 26% after the resignation announcement, allowing Budman to perfectly time his sale to avoid significant losses.</li><li>Throughout our investigation, we found Backblaze’s track record reveals a management team lacking in transparency and willing to take aggressive and possibly illegal steps to create an illusion of financial performance to support their own exit liquidity.</li><li>Improper capitalization of expenses, like software development or Research and Development (“R&amp;D”) costs, is an age-old accounting shenanigan. When Backblaze’s former senior director of financial planning sued the company in October 2024, he claimed that Backblaze had “misstatements” related to capitalized R&amp;D assets in its 2022 report.</li><li>We checked Backblaze’s financial statements, and noticed that it has capitalized significant software costs equivalent to 9.8% - 14.4% of revenue every year since 2022. Backblaze’s capitalization rate of software development costs is the highest of 42 SaaS peers we reviewed, and almost 5x higher than the average of those 42 peers. </li><li>In Q3 2024, Backblaze introduced a new metric, “adjusted free cash flow”, and claimed it would be “adjusted free cash flow” positive by Q4 2025. Yet, in less than a quarter Backblaze changed its definition, specifically backing out “settlement costs” related to litigation and excluding “restructuring costs” from the new metric.</li><li>Backblaze fails to consistently disclose key metrics that are critical to understanding its success in moving “up market,” such as the number of customers spending more than $50,000 annually. A former Backblaze executive told us, “they were very cautious about having a duty to report that number out of concern of, is that number always going to be good?  Is it always going to be growing? What happens [if] that number ever went backwards? … And how do we continue to message the move up market as successful.”</li><li>After the exit of CFO Frank Patchel, in August 2024, one might have expected Backblaze to bring in a CFO with a track-record of turning around poorly performing companies. Instead, Backblaze’s new CFO, Marc Suidan, joined from Beachbody (NYSE: BODI), a multi-level marketing company, where he was CFO from May 2022 to August 2024. During his tenure, BeachBody missed earnings estimates in 6 out of 9 quarters and the stock fell 91%.</li><li>Backblaze touts a differentiated solution and success with “AI” clients, yet it appears to offer a commoditized storage solution that primarily competes on cost. In January 2025, Backblaze’s former CTO stated on a public forum, “I chalk it up to companies like Backblaze wanting to be associated with the hot new thing (AI) right now. But honestly, some things just aren’t AI.” </li><li>Backblaze is being beaten by close competitors such as Wasabi, which offers the same services. One former Backblaze executive told us: “[Backblaze] let Wasabi blow right past them. The Wasabi brand is way better known. Their growth rate is higher. Their global presence is better. Their channel presence is better … They just won and Backblaze lost.”</li><li>Meanwhile, a current executive from Wasabi confirmed, “We have at least half a dozen customers who have left [Backblaze] and come to us in the last month and a half, all AI … the reason they went there is because of all the AI messaging [Backblaze was] doing, and then they realized that it’s actually not as true as what they’ve been saying. And now they’ve come to us.” </li><li>Backblaze noted a large customer loss during its Q4 2024 earnings call. We interviewed a Wasabi sales executive who confirmed that they took a large customer from Backblaze, saying, “I was actually surprised when I had heard that [the customer] had come over [to Wasabi] because I knew that they were such a big partner for Backblaze.” </li><li>Backblaze, in our view, is the archetype of a failed growth business and its latest “restructuring” will do little to resurrect the company’s woeful capital market performance or transform its undifferentiated storage offering. Its capital markets story has been kept alive by allegedly inflated cash flow forecasts, hidden internal investigations and accounting tricks, which appear to fuel exit liquidity for insiders.</li><li>If Backblaze’s leadership truly holds transparency as one of its “most cherished values”, then management should have no issue answering the 12 questions we have included at the bottom of this report.</li></ul><p><em>Initial Disclosure: After extensive research, we believe the evidence justifies a short position in shares of Backblaze (NASDAQ: BLZE).

<p>We asked a former executive at closest peer <a href="https://wasabi.com/company?ref=morpheus-research.com"><u>Wasabi</u></a>, an American cloud storage provider that competes with Backblaze, how they approached capitalization of internal development costs. The former executive insisted that they “don’t capitalize that” and confirmed that no costs related to software development were capitalized.</p><p>In 2024, with appropriate capitalization, Backblaze’s loss would have been 20% higher, from a $48.5 million loss before tax to a $58.3 million loss before tax, per our calculations.</p>


<p>This excessive capitalization may be related to what whistleblower Hall outlined in his lawsuit against Backblaze when he stated that he could not sign off on the company’s financial reports due to “misstatements” in “Capitalized R&amp;D.” [<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/secret/1mLNrHGolRm2sL?ref=morpheus-research.com#5"><u>Pgs. 5-6</u></a>]</p><p>All told, we believe Backblaze has resorted to aggressive accounting to inflate the results of an already loss-making business.

So how do we talk about the value of things? But when it came to Backblaze and the enterprise or mid-market sales teams at Backblaze, there was just no room for that ... you are always competing against, with pricing, essentially.” </em></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, a former senior leader from direct competitor <a href="https://www.storj.io/company/about?ref=morpheus-research.com"><u>Storj</u></a> told us that Backblaze brings little to the table in terms of differentiated performance, and had little to offer the market in AI. </p><blockquote><em>“Listen, there&#39;s $2.2 trillion being spent in net new infrastructure spend over the next three years on AI alone.

The Wasabi brand is way better known. Their growth rate is higher. Their global presence is better. Their channel presence is better … <strong>They just won and Backblaze lost.&#34; </strong></em></blockquote><p>Further highlighting issues with Backblaze’s channel program, the former Backblaze executive said:</p><blockquote><em>“Wasabi was killing us in the channel … Backblaze [had a] lame ass channel program and Wasabi [had a] killer channel program.&#34; </em></blockquote><p>We spoke to another former sales employee at Backblaze, who specifically said Backblaze’s channel strategy was losing out to Wasabi.</p><blockquote><em>“When Gleb’s up there and talking about the channel and this, like Gleb has no idea which is, it&#39;s just interesting … Wasabi is just eating their lunch.”  </em></blockquote><p>We also interviewed an executive from Wasabi, who told us that they are rapidly taking business from Backblaze. </p><blockquote><em>“We have at least half a dozen customers who have left [Backblaze] and come to us in the last month and a half, all AI … The reason they went there is because of all the AI messaging [Backblaze was] doing, and then they realized that it’s actually not as true as what they’ve been saying.

During its lifetime as a public company, Backblaze has never turned a profit, nor delivered value for its original IPO investors. All the while, key insiders have cashed out millions by selling large quantities of stock in a thinly traded market despite advice against it, per testimony from former executives in undisclosed litigation. </p><p>Management continues to insist that it has an “<a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/backblaze-at-jmp-technology-conference-strategic-growth-and-ai-opportunities-93CH-3912246?ref=morpheus-research.com#:~:text=innovative%20and%20disruptive%20solution"><u>innovative and disruptive solution</u></a>” in what appears to us to be a competitive and commoditized storage business, dominated by deep-pocketed tech companies and smaller, faster-growing peers. </p><p>After its woeful capital market performance and undifferentiated storage offering, Backblaze’s response has simply been to double-down, believing that throwing money at new sales staff and chasing bigger customers can solve its issues.</p><p>To keep its capital markets story alive, Backblaze has fed its auditor fraudulent projections, hidden internal investigations from shareholders, and engaged in accounting tricks to inflate profitability metrics, per allegations in lawsuits and our own research.</p><p>As with many beleaguered tech companies, investors may hang on with the hope of a buy-out, but in reality, we believe Backblaze has no back-up plan and its reported numbers deserve major scrutiny. </p><h3 id="questions-for-management">Questions for Management</h3><p>Backblaze states on its <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/allow-us-to-introduce-ourselves/?ref=morpheus-research.com#:~:text=Transparency%20is%20one%20of%20our,our%20designs%2C%20statistics%2C%20and%20calculations"><u>website</u></a> that “transparency is one of our most cherished values—if not <em>the</em> most important value of our business.” If this truly is the case, we believe Backblaze’s management team will have no issue responding to our 12 questions below:</p><p>1) Backblaze is facing two lawsuits from former senior employees, including the company’s former VP of Investor Relations and Senior Director of FP&amp;A. The lawsuits make extremely serious allegations of accounting and insider trading improprieties. Why has Backblaze not disclosed these lawsuits to shareholders? </p><p>2) According to lawsuits from former employees, Backblaze founders implemented an aggressive 10b5-1 trading plan after the IPO that went against the advice of Backblaze’s General Counsel, CFO, VP of Investor Relations, and a third-party capital markets advisor. Is it true that these individuals warned against the trading plan due to the risk of “crushing” Backblaze’s stock price? If so, why did you disregard the warnings of key advisors?</p><p>3) A former employee claimed that co-founder Brian Wilson wrote an email to management stating that if the stock goes to zero, he would feel “beyond” justified regarding his share sales. Why would a Backblaze co-founder feel “justified” for sending the stock to zero? </p><p>4) These former employees claim that CEO Gleb Budman sold $1.6 million in stock while in possession of knowledge related to the CFO’s imminent resignation, which had not yet been announced to shareholders. If true, this allowed Budman to avoid substantial losses. Was Gleb Budman aware of Frank Patchel’s imminent retirement when he sold $1.6 million in stock?  </p><p>5) A former employee claimed that he brought evidence of inflated cash flow forecasts to the board of directors that resulted in an internal investigation. Is this true? If so, which firm conducted the investigation and why was this not disclosed to shareholders?</p><p>6) When did this investigation begin and end, and what were its findings? Did the founders continue to sell shares during this investigation?</p><p>7) Another former employee alleged there were misstatements in Backblaze’s 2022 10-K related to fixed assets, capitalized R&amp;D, cash flow, and equity accounting. What has management done to investigate these claims? </p><p>8) Backblaze’s definition of “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” changed in Q4 2024 to exclude costs related to legal settlements, even though Backblaze has not disclosed any ongoing litigation, or a provision for costs related to litigation. Since Backblaze is facing two lawsuits from former employees, what contingent provision has Backblaze established for potential settlements and other legal costs? </p><p>9) Retail investors have been asking pointed questions to management since Backblaze’s IPO. In Q2 2024, Backblaze suddenly stopped taking questions from retail investors. Why? </p><p>10) As a percentage of revenue, Backblaze capitalizes more internal-use software costs than 42 SaaS peers, and is ~5x higher than the average capitalization rate of these peers. This significantly boosts reported net income. How does management justify this accounting treatment? </p><p>11) Backblaze hired a new CFO, whose last company, Beachbody, missed earnings estimates 6 out of 9 quarters during his tenure, whose share price declined by 91% over the same time period, and the company is now facing risk of continuing as a going concern. Why did Backblaze choose to hire him?12) A Wasabi executive told us they had “half a dozen” AI customers leave Backblaze and come to Wasabi in the last month and a half. Why did they leave? Will Backblaze share metrics around customer additions and losses? Will Backblaze also share the number of customers deemed “AI customers” and how that number has changed over time?</p><p><strong>Disclosure: We are short shares of Backblaze (NASDAQ: BLZE)</strong></p><p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong></p><p><em>Use of Morpheus Research LLC’s (“Morpheus Research”) research is at your own risk.
