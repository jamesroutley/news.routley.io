    <h1>Futurehome smart hub owners must pay new $117 subscription or lose access</h1>

          <p>Smart home device maker Futurehome is forcing its customers’ hands by suddenly requiring a subscription for basic functionality of its products.</p>
<p>Launched in 2016, Futurehome’s Smarthub is marketed as a central hub for controlling Internet-connected devices in smart homes. For years, the Norwegian company sold its products, which also include smart thermostats, smart lighting, and smart fire and carbon monoxide alarms, for a one-time fee that included access to its companion app and cloud platform for control and automation. As of June 26, though, those core features require a 1,188 NOK (about $116.56) annual subscription fee, turning the smart home devices into dumb ones if users don&#39;t pay up.</p>
<p>“You lose access to controlling devices, configuring; automations, modes, shortcuts, and energy services,” a company <a href="https://support.futurehome.no/hc/en-no/articles/28158944965277-FAQ-Subscription">FAQ page</a> says.</p>
<p>You also can’t get support from Futurehome without a subscription. “Most” paid features are inaccessible without a subscription, too, the FAQ from Futurehome, which claims to be in 38,000 households, says.</p>
<p>After June 26, customers had four weeks to continue using their devices as normal without a subscription. That grace period recently ended, and users now need a subscription for their smart devices to work properly.</p>
<p>Some users are understandably disheartened about suddenly having to pay a monthly fee to use devices they already purchased. More advanced users have also expressed frustration with Futurehome potentially killing its devices’ ability to work by connecting to a local device instead of the cloud. In its FAQ, Futurehome says it “cannot guarantee that there will not be changes in the future” around local API access.</p>
<p>In response, a Reddit user, according to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/norge/comments/1lek0p7/futurehome_tvinger_eksisterende_kunder_over_til/?tl=en">Reddit-provided translation</a> of the Norwegian post, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can understand to some extent that they have to do it for services that have ongoing expenses, like servers (even though I actually think it&#39;s their problem, not mine, that they didn&#39;t realize this was a bad idea when they sold me the solution), but a local function that only works internally in the equipment I&#39;ve already paid for shouldn&#39;t be blocked behind a paywall.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Futurehome, subscription-less customers can still create, delete, and switch between households, edit household users and owners, and update and factory reset their Futurehome Smarthubs.</p>
