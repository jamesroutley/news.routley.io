    <h1>Why I&#39;m still using Python</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p>I‚Äôve been using Python since 2006, and every year I ask myself if it‚Äôs still the right language for me. I don‚Äôt want to get stuck using a language just because it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôve become comfortable using. Languages are constantly evolving, and if there‚Äôs a language that better suits my needs I‚Äôll happily invest the time needed to make a change. In the end, though, Python is still right for me, for the same reasons it was right in 2006: it lets me get the work done that I want to do, enjoyably and efficiently. There‚Äôs also the added bonus of getting to be part of one of the best communities I‚Äôve ever been involved in.</p><p>I grew up in the 70s and 80s, and my father was a software engineer at the time. We had a kit computer in our basement before most people had even thought of having a computer at home. I learned the fundamentals of programming when I was nine or ten years old; the first programs I wrote were in BASIC. Over the next twenty years I dabbled in a variety of languages: LOGO, Pascal, C, Fortran, Perl, Javascript, Java, and PHP. I was a hobbyist programmer, and I enjoyed learning a new language every few years. In 2006 I was working on a larger (for me) project in Java, and a friend told me I should check out Python. ‚ÄúYour programs will do the same things, they‚Äôll just be one third as long as they were in Java.‚Äù That was a bold claim, but as I looked at a thousand-line file, it seemed like a pretty good idea to find out if he was right.</p><p>Rewriting that first project in Python was magical. As I reimplemented sections of the project, I watched my files grow shorter, and they looked cleaner as well. I‚Äôd always enjoyed programming, but writing Python felt different. Ideas that were newer at the time such as semantic whitespace, and not needing to declare variable types, went from strange new patterns to ideas that made perfect sense in retrospect. My files looked consistent and well-structured, and they were much easier to read, review, and debug. Also, they were just plain fun to write. When the project was finished the files were, in fact, less than half the length of the corresponding Java files.</p><p>My programming efforts shifted from hobbyist to professional over the next ten years, and as my projects grew more significant Python continued to serve me well. The code ‚Äúgot out of my way‚Äù much more than it had in the other languages I‚Äôd been using. I was still doing programming work, but I found myself spending more of my time thinking about the real-world problems I cared to solve and less time thinking about syntax and language-specific constructs.</p><p>I went to my first Python conference in 2012. I was intimidated about going because I was a teacher first and a programmer second, and I assumed everyone there would be a professional programmer. When I showed up I found an entirely welcoming community. Half the people there were clearly better programmers than I‚Äôd ever be, because it‚Äôs what they focused on. But half the people there were just like me; they had real-world problems they wanted to solve, and they were finding that Python could help them work more effectively and more efficiently. My life got better the moment I stepped into the Python community, and it‚Äôs been one of the best parts of my life ever since.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8f6ea1-2d0c-4abb-84db-054ff4c03bb1_1224x1632.jpeg" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8f6ea1-2d0c-4abb-84db-054ff4c03bb1_1224x1632.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8f6ea1-2d0c-4abb-84db-054ff4c03bb1_1224x1632.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8f6ea1-2d0c-4abb-84db-054ff4c03bb1_1224x1632.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8f6ea1-2d0c-4abb-84db-054ff4c03bb1_1224x1632.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8f6ea1-2d0c-4abb-84db-054ff4c03bb1_1224x1632.jpeg" width="452" height="602.6666666666666" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3f8f6ea1-2d0c-4abb-84db-054ff4c03bb1_1224x1632.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:false,&#34;imageSize&#34;:&#34;normal&#34;,&#34;height&#34;:1632,&#34;width&#34;:1224,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:452,&#34;bytes&#34;:978254,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Me standing inside a burned-out redwood trunk.&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="Me standing inside a burned-out redwood trunk." title="Me standing inside a burned-out redwood trunk." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8f6ea1-2d0c-4abb-84db-054ff4c03bb1_1224x1632.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8f6ea1-2d0c-4abb-84db-054ff4c03bb1_1224x1632.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8f6ea1-2d0c-4abb-84db-054ff4c03bb1_1224x1632.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8f6ea1-2d0c-4abb-84db-054ff4c03bb1_1224x1632.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>In 2012, PyCon was held in Santa Clara, CA.
