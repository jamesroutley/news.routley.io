Y Combinator says that Apple&#39;s &#34;anti-steering restraints&#34; have long inhibited the growth and development of technology companies that monetize goods and services through apps.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-anti-steering-injunction-violation/">Back in April</a>, Apple was found to be violating a 2021 injunction that required it to let developers direct customers to third-party purchase options on the web using in-app links. Apple had implemented a system for developers to link to external websites in their apps, but it charged an up to 27 percent fee to do so.</p>
<p>Apple was found to be in &#34;willful violation&#34; of the anti-steering injunction, and it was ordered to allow developers to freely link to purchase options outside of the ‌App Store‌ with no fees or restrictions on link format. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-updates-u-s-app-review-guidelines-epic/">implemented those changes</a>, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/apple-appeals-app-store-payment-rule-changes/">also filed an appeal</a>, so there is potential for the decision to be walked back. ‌Epic Games‌ and now Y Combinator are aiming to prevent Apple from being able to revert to its old ‌App Store‌ rules around linking.</p>
<p>Y Combinator says that it has &#34;long been hesitant&#34; to support app-based businesses subject to &#34;the Apple Tax&#34; because they were poor investments.<br/>
</p>
<blockquote><p>A 30% revenue share can easily be the difference between a company that can afford to scale, hire new employees, and reinvest in its product, and one that is perpetually struggling to stay afloat. Understood in this light, the 30% Apple Tax protected from erosion by Apple&#39;s anti-steering restraints is not merely a cost of doing business, it is a profound and often insurmountable barrier to entry that stifles competition and innovation at its source.</p></blockquote>
<p>The enforcement order that&#39;s currently in place has already created renewed investor interest in app-based business models that were previously not feasible, according to Y Combinator. The company believes that Apple adds minimal value for the fees that it collects.</p>
<p>Y Combinator suggests that the court end Apple&#39;s anti-steering restraints permanently to promote innovation and to allow tech startups to freely compete.</p>
