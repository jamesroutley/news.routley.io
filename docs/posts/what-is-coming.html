    <h1>what is coming</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>it feels like the old era of technology is coming to an end. computers (and phones) used to be mostly tools where we did our work.</p>
<p>user interfaces was all about clicks and buttons. last 20 years software was like Adobe Photoshop(or Figma) or GMail - you needed to click around, press some buttons, type few things or draw, find context menus etc.</p>
<p>most of it coming rapidly to the end. user interfaces are going to be timeline/conversation based.</p>
<p>the medium is less important (text or audio is not a dramatic change here). but going from wide screens where we did things to the conversational timelines where we tell computers what to do is a huge change.</p>
<p>before we would write a blog post or draw an image. now we will tell computer to do that for us. we will state what we want and will get that.</p>
<p>implications are so profound that it&#39;s hard to imagine how things will look in few years.</p>
<p>computers used to be a tool to help us and speed up our main work. now we will have like a swarm of background virtual assistants. we will tell them what we want and they will make it happen: do research on some topic (what is a good kinder garden for my child and how to get there), find a buy guitar produced in Poland, research and make a best personal plan for getting in shape for a marathon etc.</p>
<p>i don&#39;t want to write that more on this topic. if you saw what is happening- you already know it, if you didn&#39;t experience yet the magic of the latest tech - it sounds like a crazy talk.</p>
<p>new operating system is coming. before it was &#34;operating system for our work&#34; and now we will see &#34;operating system for our lives&#34;.</p>
