                    <p>It has been one and a half years since <a target="_blank" href="https://aeroxplorer.com/articles/ukrainian-civil-airspace-closed.php">the Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>. Since the onset of the war, many sanctions have been placed on Russia, including on the country&#39;s aviation industry. Many parts in (western made) Russian passenger aircraft that would normally be easily replaced are rapidly wearing out with no replacement parts in sight due to the import of spare aircraft parts from Boeing and Airbus being banned since March 2022. </p><p>Due to the aforementioned sanctions, Russian flag carrier Aeroflot is experiencing problems replacing worn-out brakes on &#34;foreign&#34; (non-Russian-made) aircraft.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.aeroxplorer.com/large/TEB-PMqbC8cGnKGcbaCJVqhy.jpg"/><figcaption>Photo: A T | AeroXplorer</figcaption></figure><p>An aircraft can land without brakes, as during landing most of the work of stopping a commercial aircraft is done through the use of thrust reversers. However, landing without the aid of brakes will significantly increase the amount of runway an aircraft uses on landing. Brakes are also necessary for aborting takeoffs, through the use of Auto Brakes, which automatically activate should pilots decide to abort a takeoff for whatever reason. </p><p>Despite the airline requesting pilots turn off brakes on affected aircraft, mechanics and technicians in Aeroflot&#39;s flight operations department are actively warning pilots of the increased risk of runway overruns. When pilots land an affected Aeroflot aircraft (without brakes), &#34;...The aircraft will tend to turn to the side...especially when landing on a wet runway with a side [side] wind...&#34; </p><p>According to The Moscow Times, Russian Airlines are allowed to refuse the repair of aircraft brakes for up to 10 days, after which they must either be replaced or turned off, with a notification of the Federal Agency for Air Transport (FATA) required. </p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.aeroxplorer.com/large/TEB-OkB9TGwo6uOx0i6j4tjr.jpg"/><figcaption>Photo: AeroXplorer | Lukasz S.</figcaption></figure><!--END BODY-->
