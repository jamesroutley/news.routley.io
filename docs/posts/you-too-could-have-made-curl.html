<p>This is the video recording of my talk with this title, done at February 4, 2024 10:00 in the K1.105 room at FOSDEM 2024. The room can hold some 800 people but there were a few hundred seats still unoccupied. Several people I met up with later have insisted that 10 am on a Sunday is way too early for attending talks…</p>



<p>When I was about to start my talk, the slides would not show on the projector. Yeah, sigh. Nothing surprising maybe, but you always hope you can avoid these problems – in particular in the last moment with a huge audience waiting.</p>



<p>There was this separate video monitor laptop that clearly showed that my laptop would output the correct thing – in a proper resolution (1280 x 720 as per auto-negotiation), but the projector refused to play ball. The live stream could also see my output, so the problem was somehow from the video box to the projector.</p>



<p>Several people eventually got involved, things were rebooted multiple times, cables were yanked and replugged in again. First after I installed <a href="https://christian.amsuess.com/tools/arandr/">arandr</a> and forced-updated the resolution of my HDMI output to 1920×1080  the projector would suddenly show my presentation. (Later on I was told that people had <em>the same</em> problem in this room the day before…)</p>



<p>That was about nine minutes of technical difficulties that is cut out from the recording. Nine minutes to test my nerves and presentation finesse as I had to adapt.</p>
