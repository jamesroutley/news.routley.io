    <h1>Raspberry Pi Pico Hack Unlocks Two Extra ‚ÄúHidden‚Äù GPIO Pins</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p>Pseudonymous maker &#34;HealthyCabinet,&#34; hereafter Cabinet, has come up with a neat hack for anyone running out of general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico: a bypass to gain an extra two pins, potentially expandable to four.</p><p><span>The RP2040-powered Raspberry Pi Pico </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/hands-on-with-the-rp2040-and-pico-the-first-in-house-silicon-and-microcontroller-from-raspberry-pi-effc452fc25d" rel="nofollow">launched in January last year</a><span> as a $4 feature-packed microcontroller board, and received the addition of a radio module last month with </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/low-cost-connectivity-for-the-iot-hands-on-with-the-raspberry-pi-pico-w-696b9f42011e" rel="nofollow">the release of the $6 Raspberry Pi Pico W</a><span>. In both cases, the low-cost development boards offer 26 externally-accessible GPIO pins across two castellated breadboard-friendly headers ‚Äî which, for some projects, may not be enough.</span></p><div><div><p><span>A soldering iron and a steady hand can increase the number of GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi Pico. (üì∑: HealthyCabinet)</span></p></div></div><p>&#34;I want to use a [Raspberry Pi] Pico to replace the MCU [Microcontroller Unit] on a mechanical keyboard,&#34; Cabinet explains of their needs, &#34;but the keyboard matrix is 7√ó16 and it has two SPI LED controllers. This means I will need 27 GPIO pins. I don&#39;t care about the onboard LED and I plan to power it from USB at all times. I don&#39;t need the VBUS sense (GP24) or onboard LED (GP25) connected anymore, and with the extra pins liberated I should be able to use a Pico for this project.&#34;</p><p>Turning to the official datasheet for the Raspberry Pi Pico, Cabinet was able to find where the GPIO lines were exposed on the circuit board ‚Äî using a CircuitPython program to toggle them on and off while tracing the signal to ensure they could be easily software-controlled. By removing two resistors and soldering wires in their place, the two &#34;hidden&#34; GPIO pins were released for use with external hardware.</p><div><div><p><span>By replacing parts with jumper wires, the &#34;hidden&#34; GPIOs are unlocked. (üì∑: HealthyCabinet)</span></p></div></div><p>There&#39;s the potential to uncover another two hidden pins, bringing the total accessible to users to 30, as well. &#34;I could potentially free up two more GPIOs since I don&#39;t really need the SMPS [Switched-Mode Power Supply] mode switch (I could wire it to GND or 3v3 permanently depending on my power requirements) or knowledge of VSYS voltage (since I&#39;ll always power from USB), but that&#39;s an exercise for the reader if they need 30 GPIO pins and don&#39;t want to design their own board.&#34;</p><p><span>More details are available </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/w37gx2/i_freed_up_two_gpios_on_the_raspberry_pi_pico/" rel="nofollow">in Cabinet&#39;s Reddit thread</a><span>, with images of the modified board posted </span><a href="https://imgur.com/a/e8Ccs2o" rel="nofollow">to Imgur</a><span>.</span></p></div></section></div>
