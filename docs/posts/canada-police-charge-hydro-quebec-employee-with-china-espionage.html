police said in a statement.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He will appear in court in Longueuil, Quebec, on Tuesday to face four criminal charges. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The resident of Candiac, a suburb south of Montreal, is accused of obtaining trade secrets, unauthorised use of a computer, breach of trust by a public officer and fraud for obtaining trade secrets.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The crimes allegedly occurred between February 2018 and October 2022.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A company statement said that Mr Wang worked on batteries for the utility&#39;s Center of Excellence in Transportation Electrification and Energy Storage (CETEES), which develops technology for electric vehicles.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>RCMP Inspector David Beaudoin said that Mr Wang used his position at Hydro-Quebec to conduct research for a Chinese university and other researcher centres. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He allegedly published scientific articles and submitted patents in &#34;association [with] this foreign actor rather than with Hydro-Quebec&#34;, he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>An investigation was launched into Mr Wang in August 2022 after the company&#39;s internal security branch filed a complaint.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Our detection and intervention mechanisms allowed our investigators to bring this matter to the attention of the RCMP, with whom we have worked closely ever since,&#34;a security official at Hydro-Quebec said in a statement, adding that &#34;no organisation is safe from a situation like this one&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The public utility company handles electricity generation, transmission and storage for the Canadian province, and exports power to parts of the US as well. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is the largest power utility in Canada, according to a company website.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The RCMP statement called it a priority for them and other law enforcement and intelligence agencies worldwide to &#34;detect and disrupt foreign interference attempts&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Hydro-Quebec is considered a critical infrastructure and a strategic interest to be protected,&#34; investigators said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The RCMP and its partners are working together with at-risk sectors to improve Canada&#39;s response and resiliency to this threat.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In the coming weeks, Canada is expected to announce a new Indo-Pacific strategy. Earlier this month, Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly said the country would seek to deepen ties with other partners in Asia. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;China is an increasingly disruptive global power,&#34; she said in a speech warning Canadian companies not to be become too entangled with Chinese businesses. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;What I would like to say to Canadians doing business in and with China: you need to be clear-eyed,&#34; Ms Joly said.</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
