    <h1>Cerebras-GPT vs. LLaMA AI Model Performance Comparison</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>On March 28th, Cerebras released on <a href="https://huggingface.co/cerebras/Cerebras-GPT-13B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HuggingFace</a> a new Open
Source model trained on <a href="https://pile.eleuther.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pile</a> dataset called &#34;Cerebras-GPT&#34; with GPT-3-like
performance. (
<a href="https://www.cerebras.net/blog/cerebras-gpt-a-family-of-open-compute-efficient-large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link to press release</a>)</p><h2 id="what-makes-cerebras-interesting">What makes Cerebras interesting?<a href="#what-makes-cerebras-interesting" aria-label="Direct link to What makes Cerebras interesting?" title="Direct link to What makes Cerebras interesting?">​</a></h2><p>While Cerebras isn&#39;t as capable of a model for performing tasks when compared directly to models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLaMA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LLaMA</a>,
ChatGPT, or GPT-4, it has one important quality that sets it apart: It&#39;s been released under the Apache 2.0 licence,
a fully
permissive Open Source license, and the weights are available for anybody to download and try out.</p><p>This is different from other models like LLaMA that, while their weights are freely available, their <a href="https://huggingface.co/decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">license</a>
restricts LLaMAs usage to only &#34;Non-Commercial&#34; use cases like academic research or personal tinkering.</p><p>That means if you&#39;d like to check out LLaMA you&#39;ll have to get access to a powerful GPU to run it or use a
volunteer-run service like <a href="https://lite.koboldai.net/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KoboldAI</a>. You can&#39;t just go to a website like you can with
ChatGPT and expect to start feeding it prompts. (At least without running the risk of Meta sending you a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35287733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DMCA takedown
request</a>.)</p><h2 id="proof-of-concept-to-demonstrate-cerebras-training-hardware">Proof-of-Concept to demonstrate Cerebras Training Hardware<a href="#proof-of-concept-to-demonstrate-cerebras-training-hardware" aria-label="Direct link to Proof-of-Concept to demonstrate Cerebras Training Hardware" title="Direct link to Proof-of-Concept to demonstrate Cerebras Training Hardware">​</a></h2><p>The real reason that this model is being released is showcase the crazy silicon that Cerebras has been spending years
building.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cerebras vs NVIDIA silicon die show" src="https://www.lunasec.io/docs/assets/images/cerebras-wse-nvidia-v100-featured-image-dbd3d784176680c4a096354e72f425f9.jpg" width="1423" height="799"/></p><figcaption>A comparison of &#34;one&#34; Cerebras chip compared to an NVIDIA V100 chip.</figcaption></div></div>
