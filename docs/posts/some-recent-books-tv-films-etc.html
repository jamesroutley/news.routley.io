<p data-block-key="e1im7">Some things I&#39;ve been enjoying reading, listening to, watching, etc.</p><p data-block-key="a6l4e">Leonard <a href="https://www.crummy.com/nb/nb.cgi/category/nycb/film">reviews the movies we watch</a>. We recently enjoyed the <i>Bill &amp; Ted&#39;s Excellent Adventure</i> trilogy, and subsequently listened to <a href="https://www.filmreroll.com/?p=153">the Film Reroll adaptation</a>.</p><p data-block-key="enpvp">I deeply enjoyed <i>The Lost City</i>, a fast-paced, funny wish-fulfillment fantasy about a guy supporting the woman he loves. We then watched <i>Romancing the Stone</i>, a kind of inspiration for <i>The Lost City</i>, and I found that I did not particularly like <i>Romancing the Stone</i>, which has a lot more &#34;jerk with a heart of gold&#34; characterization and &#34;I know you&#39;re supposed to be sheltered but COME ON&#34; disbelief. Heads-up that <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/lost-city-of-d"><i>The Lost City</i> is streaming on Paramount+ in the US</a>, in case you have subscribed to Paramount+ for its approximately fifteen current <i>Star Trek</i> shows (<i>Discovery, Lower Decks, Picard, Prodigy, Strange New Worlds, Enterprise But Phlox Is the Captain, Peter David&#39;s USS Camelot, Milky Way Mayhem, Batman With A Bat&#39;leth, Kira, Sickbay, (The) Morn The Lurian, We Deepfaked Majel Barrett And She Plays All The Characters, Salamander Babies</i>, and the <i>Freaky Fridays for Sarek</i> miniseries).</p><p data-block-key="bkbrt"><i>Strange New Worlds</i> just wrapped up its first season -- one of the strongest first seasons I&#39;ve seen for a <i>Star Trek</i> show that&#39;s in the &#34;fly around and have episodic adventures&#34; mold. It&#39;s up there with <i>Lower Decks</i> as one of my favorite current <i>Trek</i> shows. <i>Prodigy</i> is about the kinds of teens who often make impulsive bad decisions, which is the opposite of what I want in <i>Trek</i> (a team of skilled adults smoothly cooperating to creatively solve problems). There are things I like about <i>Discovery</i>, and I&#39;ll keep watching it, but there&#39;s so much arc stuff to keep track of and the Fate Of The Galaxy is at stake too often for my taste. <i>Lower Decks</i> is sometimes very funny but also I wish Mariner&#39;s character growth wouldn&#39;t keep resetting; at her worst she is a bully and I don&#39;t root for a bully character. And <i>Picard</i> can be fun but also I want my scifi to explore new stuff, not just try to pander to who it thinks I am with &#34;hey, these people are related to the folks you already care about from when you watched this franchise decades ago!&#34; I think <i>Strange New Worlds</i> hits this balance better, although this might be because I have watched nearly none of the original series so I am probably missing some pandering that would be clangingly obvious to a more comprehensive fan.</p><p data-block-key="eh0se">And I&#39;ve been rewatching various individual episodes of <i>Leverage</i>, aided by <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16o0BCndTdWTLIU_8uIk-9T28CYbSaFNdwYI01GxClKE/edit#gid=0">the spreadsheet</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/elysdir/status/1403755268870049792">Jed Hartman made</a> to catalog <a href="https://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/search/label/leverage">John Rogers&#39;s blog posts answering questions about them</a>. (Back in 2008 I started watching <i>Leverage</i> mainly because I was already reading Rogers&#39;s blog for the political posts, and wanted to understand his shoptalk posts better.)</p><p data-block-key="87t2k"><a href="https://www.thehugoawards.org/2022/05/2022-hugo-voting-open-and-voter-packet-released/">The deadline for ballots for the Hugo Award is August 11th</a>, and Ada Palmer&#39;s Terra Ignota series is on the Best Series ballot, so I am making my way through those (I read the first book, <i>Too Like the Lightning</i>, ages ago, but am only now reading the other books; I&#39;ve just finished <i>The Will to Battle</i> and am starting the final book, <i>Perhaps the Stars,</i> soon). I&#39;m having a mixed time. There are several very unpleasant people in these books and I took a break in the middle to read a few Celia Lake romances where kind, considerate people treat each other well. The narrator is pretty unreliable, and I know Palmer is writing a big giant epic and I&#39;ve heard things get even weirder in book 4, so I&#39;m waiting till I finish the last book to mark down complaints of the &#34;but why is [aspect of how large scale societies and historical changes work] completely absent from this story?&#34; type. I do want to know how the plot resolves, and enjoy many bits of the dialogue and the worldbuilding details (the kitchen trees! the Utopian oath!) and the mystery investigations.</p><p data-block-key="4jeav"><i>Everything Everywhere All At Once</i> is a sublime film and I loved how generous and surprising it was. I <a href="https://fanfare.metafilter.com/19499/Everything-Everywhere-All-at-Once#288384">wrote about it some on FanFare</a> but in summary: hurray for movies where I do not know what is going to happen next but I can trust that the filmmakers are interested in viewer pleasure and in characters courageously being vulnerable to each other and to themselves!</p>
