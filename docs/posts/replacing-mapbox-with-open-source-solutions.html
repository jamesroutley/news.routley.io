  <p>Last week I published <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2023/all-cash-buyers-housing-market/">a story</a> for The Washington Post that required an interactive slippy map. Lookup maps like this are a common pattern to show a geographic trend and let readers explore the data for their areas.</p>
<p>For about five years, my instinct when working on these stories is to reach for Mapbox, which has continually pushed the field ahead with innovations like <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec">vector tiles</a>, a <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/">style specification</a> and tools like <a href="https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe">tippecanoe</a>. For some projects, I’m sure we’ll continue using Mapbox. But for most of our use cases, we don’t need the latest and greatest. And Mapbox has gotten expensive.</p>
<p>Here’s what we used instead:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#openamptiles">OpenMapTiles for building tiles</a></li>
<li><a href="#maputnik">Maputnik for style editing</a></li>
<li><a href="#pmtiles">PMTiles for tile hosting</a></li>
<li><a href="#maplibre">Maplibre-gl-js for client-side rendering</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="openmaptiles"><a href="https://github.com/openmaptiles/openmaptiles">OpenMapTiles</a> for building tiles</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> is an incredible open, community-driven dataset of the world, but it’s tricky to work with. The project includes tons of data that is unnecessary for a basemap to put data visualizations over. The <a href="https://github.com/openmaptiles/openmaptiles">OpenMapTiles project</a> is a set of scripts and tools that download data from OSM and NaturalEarth, load the parts you care about into a database and generate tilesets. It also has the most bonkers <a href="https://github.com/openmaptiles/openmaptiles/blob/624cf7a8a30e5c9625da0194eafdcf88d9c104b4/Makefile">Makefile</a> I have ever seen.</p>
<p>We used this project to generate a rough U.S. base tileset, and then combined that with other geo data to build a solid — if not barebones — basemap tileset.</p>
<h2 id="maputnik"><a href="https://github.com/maputnik/editor">Maputnik</a> for style editing</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.kschaul.com/post/2023/02/16/how-the-post-is-replacing-mapbox-with-open-source-solutions/maputnik.png" alt="Screenshot of Maputnik editor, showing map layers and controls on the left, and a preview of the map on the right."/></p>
<p>Maputnik is an OSS editor for vector tiles, similar to Mapbox Studio. This tool lets you build out a <code>style.json</code> file that contains data sources, layers and style rules.</p>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://github.com/maputnik/desktop">CLI</a> you can install that boots up a local version of the editor. It can even synchronize style edits with a local <code>style.json</code> file.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="{bash}"># Install via Homebrew
$ brew install kevinschaul/homebrew-core/maputnik

# Start up the editor at http://localhost:8000/
$ maputnik

# Or, start the editor at http://localhost:8000/ while syncing changes
# to your style.json file
$ maputnik --file style.json
</code></pre><h2 id="pmtiles"><a href="https://protomaps.com/">PMTiles</a> for tile hosting</h2>
<p>PMTiles are an exciting new concept for serving map tiles. Typically tiles are baked out into millions of individual files, organized into directories for zoom level, x and y. A PMTiles file is a single archive containing all of that tile data that’s optimized for tile lookups. Client-side maps can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests">HTTP Range Requests</a> to download specific tiles directly from the PMTiles file — no intermediary necessary.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.kschaul.com/post/2023/02/16/how-the-post-is-replacing-mapbox-with-open-source-solutions/pmtiles.png" alt="A screenshot of the PMTiles website, showing that three tiles were loaded using HTTP Range Requests"/></p>
<p>PMTiles are an impressive and elegant solution to tile hosting. Deploying a new tileset to a service like Amazon S3 requires uploading just one big file rather than millions — saving a ton of time. And we don’t need to run a tileserver to fetch tiles. It’s so smart.</p>
<p>For The Post, I set up an AWS Lambda behind Cloudfront that, given an z/x/y URL, returns a tile from a PMtiles file. The mapping frontend thinks the tiles are regular tiles. I generated PMTiles using <a href="https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe">Felt’s version of Tippecanoe</a>, but you can also use the <a href="https://github.com/protomaps/go-pmtiles">pmtiles CLI</a>.</p>
<p>Big thanks <a href="https://moriartynaps.org/">Dylan Moriarty</a> for sending me a link to PMTiles, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bdon">Brandon Liu</a> for pushing the tech forward!</p>
<h2 id="maplibre"><a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/">maplibre-gl-js</a> for client-side rendering</h2>
<p>Maplibre is JavaScript library that can render vector tiles. It’s a fork of mapbox-gl-js from before they moved to a non-OSS license. It works great.</p>
<p>For this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2023/all-cash-buyers-housing-market/">story</a> I implemented a new approach for touch devices: Users can interact with the map either by panning/zooming with two fingers, or by entering fullscreen mode. I think it works pretty well!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.kschaul.com/post/2023/02/16/how-the-post-is-replacing-mapbox-with-open-source-solutions/allcash-demo.gif" alt="A demo of the map in the all cash story, showing the user entering an exiting fullscreen mode"/></p>
<p>All of these projects depend on the open source community to stay relevant. I’m lucky to have gotten to spend work hours contributing back. Hopefully in the near future I can share more about some custom tooling that strings these projects together.</p>
