    <h1>PyPy has moved to Git, GitHub</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody text">
      <p>PyPy has moved its canonical repo and issue tracker from
<a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy">https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy</a> to <a href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy">https://github.com/pypy/pypy</a>. Obviously,
this means development will now be tracked in Git rather than Mercurial.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation<a href="#motivation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We still feel Mercurial is a better version control system. The named branch
model and user interface are superior. But</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>foss.heptapod.net is not well indexed in google/bing/duckduckgo
  search, so people find it harder to search for issues in the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since Heptapod has tightened its spam control, we get reports that
  users create issues only to have them flagged as spam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Source has become synonymous with GitHub, and we are too small to
  change that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much of the current development comes as a reaction to fixing issues.
  Tracking interlocking issues is easier if all the code is on the same
  platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/faq.html#why-doesn-t-pypy-use-git-and-move-to-github">FAQ</a>
  presents two arguments against the move. <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes">Github notes</a>
  solves much of point (1): the difficulty of discovering provenance of
  commits, although not entirely. But the main problem is point (2), it turns
  out that <strong>not</strong> moving to GitHub is an impediment to contribution and issue
  reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who wish to continue to use Mercurial can use the same method below to
  push to GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub is more resource rich than foss.heptapod.net. We could add CI
  jobs to replace some of our aging <a href="https://buildbot.pypy.org">buildbot
  infrastructure</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method<a href="#method" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The migration required two parts: migrating the code and then migrating the
issues and merge requests.</p>
<h4 id="code-migration-1-code-and-notes">Code migration 1: code and notes<a href="#code-migration-1-code-and-notes" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>I used a <a href="https://github.com/mnauw/git-remote-hg">fork of git-remote-hg</a> to
create a local Git repo with all the changesets. Then I wanted to add a Git
note to each commit with the branch it came from. So I prepared a file with two
columns: the Git commit hash, and the corresponding branch from Mercurial.
Mercurial can describe each commit in two ways: either the commit hash or by a
number index. I used <code>hg log</code> to convert an index <code>i</code> to the Mercurial hash,
and then <code>git-hg-helper</code> from <code>git-remote-hg</code> to convert the Mercurial hash to
a Git hash:</p>
<div><pre>$(cd pypy-git; git-hg-helper git-rev $(cd ../pypy-hg; hg log -r $i -T&#34;{node}\n&#34;))
</pre></div>

<p>Then I used <code>hg log</code> again to print the Mercurial branch for the index <code>i</code>:</p>
<div><pre>$(cd pypy-hg; hg log -r $i -T&#39;{branch}\n&#39;)
</pre></div>

<p>Putting these two together, I could loop over all the commits by their
numerical index to prepare the file. Then I iterated over each line in the
file, and added the Git note. Since the <code>git note add</code> command works on the
current HEAD, I needed to checkout each commit in turn and then add the note:</p>
<div><pre>git checkout -q &lt;hash&gt; &amp;&amp; git notes --ref refs/notes/branch add -m branch:&lt;branch&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>I could then use <code>git push --all</code> to push to GitHub.</p>
<h4 id="code-migration-2-prepare-the-branches">Code migration 2: prepare the branches<a href="#code-migration-2-prepare-the-branches" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>PyPy has almost 500 open branches. The code migration created all the branch
HEADs, but <code>git push --all</code> did not push them. I needed to check them out and
push each one. So I created a file with all the branch names</p>
<div><pre>cd pypy-hg; hg branches | cut -f1 -d&#34; &#34; &gt; branches.txt
</pre></div>

<p>and then push each one to the GitHub repo</p>
<div><pre><span>while</span><span> </span><span>read</span><span> </span><span>branch</span><span>; do git checkout branches/$branch &amp;&amp; git push origin branches/$branch; done &lt; branches.txt</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the branches were named <code>branches/XXX</code> by the migration, not <code>branch/XXX</code>. This confuses the merge request migration, more about that later.</p>
<h4 id="issue-and-merge-request-migration">Issue and merge request migration<a href="#issue-and-merge-request-migration" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>I used the solution from
<a href="https://github.com/piceaTech/node-gitlab-2-github">node-gitlab-2-github</a> which
worked almost perfectly. It is important to do the conversion on a <strong>private
repo</strong> otherwise every mention of a sucessfully mapped user name notifies
the user about the transfer. This can be quite annoying for a repo the size of
PyPy with 600 merge requests and over 4000 issues. Issues transfered without a
problem: the script properly retained the issue numbers. However the script
does not convert the Mercurial hashes to Git hashes, so the bare hashes in
comments show up without a link to the commit. Merge requests are more of a problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mercurial named branch &#34;disappears&#34; once it is merged, so a merge request
  to a merged branch does not find the target branch name in Git. The
  conversion creates an issue instead with the label <code>gitlab merge request</code>.</li>
<li>For some reason, the branches created by <code>git-remote-hg</code> are called
  <code>branches/XXX</code> and not <code>branch/XXX</code> as expected by GitLab. This messes up the
  merge request/PR conversion. For some of the branches (open PRs and main
  target branches) I manually created additional branches without the <code>es</code>. The
  net result is that open merge requests became open PRs, merged merge requests
  became issues, and closed-not-merged merge requests were not migrated.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="layered-conversions">Layered conversions<a href="#layered-conversions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>PyPy already migrated once from Bitbucket to Heptapod. Many of the issues
reflect the multiple transitions: they have lines like &#34;Created originally on
Bitbucket by XXX&#34; from the first transition, and an additional line &#34;In
Heptapod&#34; from this transition.</p>
<h3 id="credits">Credits<a href="#credits" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude to the <a href="https://octobus.net/">Octobus</a>
team who support Heptapod. The transition from Bitbucket was quite an effort,
and they have generously hosted our developement since then. We wish them all
the best, and still believe that Mercurial should have &#34;won&#34;.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps<a href="#next-steps" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>While the repo at GitHub is live, there are still a few more things we need to
do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation needs an update for the new repo and the build automation from
  readthedocs must be adjusted.</li>
<li>The wiki should be copied from Heptapod.</li>
<li>buildbot.pypy.org should also look at the new repo. I hope the code is up to
  the task of interacting with a Git repo.</li>
<li>speed.pypy.org tracks changes, it too needs to reference the new location</li>
<li>To keep tracking branches with Git notes on new commits, I activated a
  <a href="https://github.com/Julian/named-branch-action">github action</a> by Julian to
  add a Git branch note to each commit. Please see the README there for
  directions on using Git notes.</li>
<li>Some of the merge requests were not migrated. If someone wants to, they could
  migrate those once they figure out the branch naming problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, now is the time for all of you to prove the move is worthwhile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Star the repo, let others know how to find it,</li>
<li>Help fix some of the open issues or file new ones,</li>
<li>Take advantage of the more familiar workflow to get involved in the project,</li>
<li>Suggest ways to improve the migration: are there things I missed or could
  have done better?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-will-development-change">How will development change?<a href="#how-will-development-change" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Heptapod did not allow personal forks, so we were generous with a commit bit to
the main repo. Additionally, we (well, me) have been using a
commit-directly-to-main workflow. We will now be adopting a more structured
workflow. Please fork the repo and submit a pull request for any changes. We
can now add some pre-merge CI to check that the PR at least passes the first
stage of translation. The live and active branches will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>main</code>: what was &#34;default&#34; in Mercurial, it is the Python2.7 interpreter and
  the base of the RPython interpreter,</li>
<li>
<code>py3.9</code>: the Python3.9 interpreter, which also includes all RPython changes
  from <code>main</code>. This is exactly like on Mercurial, and</li>
<li>
<code>py3.10</code>: the Python3.10 interpreter, which also includes all RPython changes
  from <code>main</code> and all bugfixes from <code>py3.9</code>. This is exactly like on Mercurial.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="finding-commits">Finding commits<a href="#finding-commits" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>If you want to figure out how a Mercurial commit relates to a Git commit, you
can use <code>git-hg-helper</code>. You run it in the Git repo. It takes the full long
hash from one repo and gives you the corresponding hash of the other repo:</p>
<div><pre>$<span> </span>git-hg-helper<span> </span>git-rev<span> </span>d64027c4c2b903403ceeef2c301f5132454491df

d64027c4c2b903403ceeef2c301f5132454491df
</pre></div>

<h5 id="finding-branches">Finding branches<a href="#finding-branches" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>Branches migrated from Mercurial will have a <code>branches</code> prefix, not <code>branch</code>.
While GitLab uses <code>branch</code> for its prefix, the <code>git-remote-hg</code> script uses
<code>branches</code>. New work should be in a PR targeting <code>main</code>, <code>py3.9</code> or <code>py3.10</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks for helping to make PyPy better.</p>
