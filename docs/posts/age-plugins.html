            <p><a href="https://age-encryption.org/?ref=words.filippo.io">age</a> is a file encryption tool, library, and format. It lets you encrypt files to “recipients” and decrypt them with “identities”.</p>
<pre><code>$ age-keygen -o key.txt
Public key: age1ql3z7hjy54pw3hyww5ayyfg7zqgvc7w3j2elw8zmrj2kg5sfn9aqmcac8p
$ tar cvz ~/data | age -r age1ql3z7hjy54pw3hyww5ayyfg7zqgvc7w3j2elw8zmrj2kg5sfn9aqmcac8p &gt; data.tar.gz.age
$ age --decrypt -i key.txt data.tar.gz.age &gt; data.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<p>You can encrypt a file to multiple recipients and decrypt it with any of the corresponding identities. There are built-in recipients for public keys and for password encryption, but age supports third-party recipient types at the format, library, and tool levels. These recipient implementations can offer alternative algorithms, support for specific hardware, or even make use of remote APIs such as cloud KMS.</p>
<p>That’s the one “<a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2016/05/16/agility.html?ref=words.filippo.io">joint</a>” in age, which otherwise aims for having no configurability.</p>
<p>At the format level, an age file starts with a header that includes “stanzas” each encrypting the file key to different recipients. The <a href="https://c2sp.org/age?ref=words.filippo.io">specification</a> requires ignoring unrecognized stanzas, so third-party ones can coexist with native ones.</p>
<p>Here’s for example the header of a file encrypted to both a native public key recipient, and to a YubiKey. Note the two stanzas, introduced by <code>-&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>At the library level, there are two fundamental interfaces that provide this abstraction: <code>Recipient</code> and <code>Interface</code>.</p>
<pre><code>// A Recipient is passed to Encrypt to wrap an opaque file key to one or more
// recipient stanza(s). It can be for example a public key like X25519Recipient,
// a plugin, or a custom implementation.
type Recipient interface {
	Wrap(fileKey []byte) ([]*Stanza, error)
}

// Encrypt encrypts a file to one or more recipients.
func Encrypt(dst io.Writer, recipients ...Recipient) (io.WriteCloser, error)

// An Identity is passed to Decrypt to unwrap an opaque file key from a
// recipient stanza. It can be for example a secret key like X25519Identity, a
// plugin, or a custom implementation.
//
// Unwrap must return an error wrapping ErrIncorrectIdentity if none of the
// recipient stanzas match the identity, any other error will be considered
// fatal.
type Identity interface {
	Unwrap(stanzas []*Stanza) (fileKey []byte, err error)
}

// Decrypt decrypts a file with one or more identities.
func Decrypt(src io.Reader, identities ...Identity) (io.Reader, error)
</code></pre>
<p>Any Go package can provide a type that implements a <code>Wrap</code> or <code>Unwrap</code> method, and pass it to <code>age.Encrypt</code> or <code>age.Decrypt</code> respectively.</p>
<p>That allows Go applications to use third-party recipients with the Go age library, but age is also a command-line tool. At the tool level, the <a href="https://c2sp.org/age-plugin?ref=words.filippo.io">age plugin system</a> exposes the Recipient and Identity interfaces over a language-agnostic stdin/stdout protocol.</p>
<p>Plugins are selected based on the name of the recipient or identity encoding. For example if you use <code>-r age1</code><strong><code>yubikey</code></strong><code>1qwt50d05nh5vutpdzmlg5wn80xq5negm4uj9ghv0snvdd3yysf5yw3rhl3t</code> the age CLI will invoke <code>age-plugin-yubikey</code> from <code>$PATH</code> to wrap the file key. This means they can be mixed and matched with other plugins and native recipients.</p>
<p>Here’s an example transcript of decrypting the file from earlier with the YubiKey plugin, complete of the plugin asking the CLI to prompt the user for the PIN and of “grease” making sure the protocol doesn’t ossify. Note that <a href="https://github.com/str4d/age-plugin-yubikey?ref=words.filippo.io">age-plugin-yubikey</a> is developed by <a href="https://github.com/str4d?ref=words.filippo.io">str4d</a> in Rust, while the age CLI is developed by me in Go.</p>

<p>The protocol only covers encryption and decryption. Plugins are expected to handle key generation in whatever way suits them best, usually by having users invoke the plugin binary directly.</p>
<p>The plugin architecture is now a few years old, and there are <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/awesome-age?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;ref=words.filippo.io#plugins">some amazing plugins</a> out there, including stable <a href="https://github.com/str4d/age-plugin-yubikey?ref=words.filippo.io">YubiKey</a> and <a href="https://github.com/remko/age-plugin-se?ref=words.filippo.io">Apple Secure Enclave</a> ones, and experimental <a href="https://github.com/Foxboron/age-plugin-tpm?ref=words.filippo.io">TPM 2.0</a>, <a href="https://github.com/olastor/age-plugin-fido2-hmac?ref=words.filippo.io">symmetric FIDO2</a>, and even <a href="https://github.com/olastor/age-plugin-sss?ref=words.filippo.io">Shamir&#39;s Secret Sharing</a> ones.</p>
<p>If a Go program wishes to use a plugin with the age library, we provide <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/age/plugin?ref=words.filippo.io#Recipient">Recipient</a> and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/age/plugin?ref=words.filippo.io#Identity">Identity</a> implementations that automatically execute plugins to implement Wrap and Unwrap. Thanks to the careful mapping of the interface and plugin abstractions, the two are effectively interchangeable.</p>
<p>To complete the picture, last month Yolan Romailler and I designed an experimental Go framework to do the opposite: turn Recipient and Identity implementations into plugins, abstracting away the plugin protocol.</p>
<p>Assuming a library already implements <code>NewRecipient</code> and <code>NewIdentity</code> functions, building a plugin boils down to just a few lines in a <code>main()</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>func main() {
	p, err := plugin.New(&#34;example&#34;)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	p.HandleRecipient(func(data []byte) (age.Recipient, error) {
		return NewRecipient(data)
	})
	p.HandleIdentity(func(data []byte) (age.Identity, error) {
		return NewIdentity(data)
	})
	os.Exit(p.Main())
}
</code></pre>
<p>The framework lets applications define their own CLI flags, for example for key generation, and supports the interactive features of the protocol such as displaying message or prompting the user.</p>
<p>It’s ready to try by <code>go get</code>-ing <code>filippo.io/age@filippo/plugin</code>, and was already <a href="https://github.com/Foxboron/age-plugin-tpm/pull/24?ref=words.filippo.io">adopted by age-plugin-tpm</a>. <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/age@v1.2.1-0.20240618131852-7eedd929a6cf/plugin?ref=words.filippo.io#Plugin">Docs are on pkg.go.dev.</a> Provide feedback in the <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/pull/580?ref=words.filippo.io">pull request</a>.</p>
<p>The Rust ecosystem already has its equivalents in the <a href="https://docs.rs/age/0.10.0/age/plugin/index.html?ref=words.filippo.io">age::plugin</a> module and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/age-plugin?ref=words.filippo.io">age-plugin crate</a>.</p>
<p>In related news, the <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/releases/tag/v1.2.0?ref=words.filippo.io">recent v1.2.0 release of age</a> introduced an extension to the Recipient interface—<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/age?ref=words.filippo.io#RecipientWithLabels">RecipientWithLabels</a>—which lets the recipient communicate to the age implementation its preferences on being mixed with other recipients, as a set of labels. For example, a recipient that returns <code>[postquantum]</code> could only be mixed with other <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/post-quantum-age/">post-quantum</a> recipients, to avoid downgrade attacks, and a recipient that returns a random string could not be mixed with any others, allowing it to uphold its users’ expectations of <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/age-authentication/">authentication</a>. This is exciting because it removes the last special case for native recipients in age, which was ensuring <em>scrypt</em> recipients could only be used alone. This extension is already supported in the Go plugin client and framework implementations, and we have a <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/pull/37?ref=words.filippo.io">pull request</a> to add it to the spec.</p>
<p>Open more thing! Speaking of plugins and specs, many hardware plugins had to redefine their own version of P-256 recipients with a tag (to avoid asking for useless PINs). We’re <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/pull/31?ref=words.filippo.io#issuecomment-2183194401">talking about</a> defining a standard one, and supporting it on the recipient side natively in age, so that users can encrypt to various hardware-based recipients without installing the plugin.</p>
