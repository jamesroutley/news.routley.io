    <h1>Tech only has one strategy: Embrace, Extend, Extinguish</h1>

<p>Most of the largest venture funded technology companies all have exactly the same marketing plan to get big. </p>



<p>Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish.</p>



<p>From wikipedia:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Embrace:</strong> Development of software substantially compatible with a competing product, or implementing a public standard.</li><li><strong>Extend:</strong> Addition and promotion of features not supported by the competing product or part of the standard, creating interoperability problems for customers who try to use the “simple” standard.</li><li><strong>Extinguish:</strong> When extensions become a de facto standard because of their dominant market share, they marginalize competitors that do not or cannot support the new extensions.</li></ol>



<p>Microsoft popularized it in their internal strategy meetings and it was only released to the public by the U.S. Department of Justice during one of their anti-trust suits.</p>



<p>The plan is effective and genius. </p>



<h2>Embrace</h2>



<p>Embrace is where you get good will and your initial customers. </p>



<p>Implement a public standard. Offer something at no cost. Offer something for a cost at no profit if it’s a physical item or service.</p>



<p>Amazon and Uber won’t make any profit on their “main” service for years and years. Maybe ever. </p>



<p>Intuit does your taxes online. Github manages your Git.</p>



<h2>Extend</h2>



<p>The more you extend, the better. Just keep extending and offering features so the free versions and your competitors can’t keep up.</p>



<p>Free email? How about 100 times more storage than any other free email with Gmail.</p>



<p>Amazon Prime will give you free returns, 24/7 customer support, and same day delivery. You’re hooked now, why would you ever go back?</p>



<h2>Extinguish</h2>



<p>Lock the customer in enough so that when you charge, they have no alternative.</p>



<p>Your Gmail storage is full but you can buy more. </p>



<p>Your business hit 1,000,000 Google maps API calls this months. </p>



<p>Your entire organization is on Slack by the time it costs money.</p>



<p>What are you going to do, go back to 5 day delivery?</p>
