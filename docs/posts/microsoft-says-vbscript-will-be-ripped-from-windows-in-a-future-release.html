    <h1>Microsoft says VBScript will be ripped from Windows in a future release</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Microsoft has stopped developing VBScript after a 27-year relationship and plans to remove the scripting language entirely in a future Windows release.</p>
<p>The IT giant said on Monday that <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/t0aew7h6(v=vs.85)">VBScript</a>, short for Visual Basic Scripting Edition, has been deprecated in an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features">update</a> to its list of &#34;Deprecated features for Windows client.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;VBScript is being deprecated,&#34; Microsoft said. &#34;In future releases of Windows, VBScript will be available as a feature on demand before its removal from the operating system.&#34;</p>

    

<p>Only a month ago, Microsoft announced the pending retirement of another software elder, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/04/microsoft_deprecates_wordpad/">WordPad</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>VBScript debuted in 1996 and its most recent release, version 5.8, dates back <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/ms10-022-description-of-the-security-update-for-visual-basic-scripting-vbscript-5-8-april-13-2010-f612b95c-7681-98db-f1fd-9862084f861e">to 2010</a>. It is a scripting language, and was for a while widely used among system administrators to automate tasks until it was eclipsed by PowerShell, which debuted in 2006.</p>
<p>&#34;Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition brings active scripting to a wide variety of environments, including Web client scripting in Microsoft Internet Explorer and Web server scripting in Microsoft Internet Information Service,&#34; Redmond explains in its help documentation.</p>

        

<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft never managed to get other browser makers to support VBScript, so outside of Microsoft-exclusive environments, web developers tended to favor JavaScript for client-side tasks.</p>

</ul>
<p>It&#39;s not as if anyone didn&#39;t see this coming. At least as far back as 2016, Microsoft said VBScript was <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/compatibility/dn384057%28v=vs.85%29">deprecated</a> in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>In 2017, Zhihua Lai, a Microsoft software engineer based in the UK, launched a website called <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://isvbscriptdead.com/">IsVBScriptDead.com</a> that argues all&#39;s well with the scripting language. VBScript, he <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/zhihualai/">says</a>, &#34;My favorite programming language…&#34;</p>
<p>The claim that VBScript is alive and well became harder to sustain two years later when, in August 2019, Microsoft disabled VBScript in Internet Explorer, before <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/06/15/internet-explorer-11-has-retired-and-is-officially-out-of-support-what-you-need-to-know/">retiring Internet Explorer</a> in June 2022.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the VBScript website, last updated December 31, 2020, insists, &#34;VBScript may seem outdated, and the support for VBScript is discontinued, but it is still being used in many places. Windows administrators may find it easier to learn/write than Powershell scripts.&#34;</p>

        

<p>VBScript&#39;s pending demise also means the end for Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, which depends on VBScript. MDT is already on notice now that it&#39;s <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/mdt/known-issues">not supported</a> with Windows 11.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#39;s planned discontinuation of VBScript may be in part motivated by security concerns, given that VBScript can be <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=TrojanDropper:VBS/RevengeRAT&amp;threatId=0">a malware vector</a>. ®</p>
