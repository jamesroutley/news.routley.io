We had to crawl and, the moment we entered, bats started flying out hysterically. We thought, okay, this is a really good sign. Then we started seeing cave crickets,&#34; says Davranoglou. Cave crickets, he explains, are peculiar looking insects. They have extremely long legs and antennae, and tiny eyes. &#34;They feel their way through the dark,&#34; he says. &#34;Cave crickets are a telltale sign that there&#39;s a rich cave ecosystem inside.&#34;<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0k0yqv8.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0k0yqv8.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0k0yqv8.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0k0yqv8.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0k0yqv8.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0k0yqv8.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0k0yqv8.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0k0yqv8.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0k0yqv8.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0k0yqv8.jpg.webp" alt="Fran Gomez de Villaboa The unusual geological formation found in Wookey Hole’s Chamber 20 is usually only seen on the surface (Credit: Fran Gomez de Villaboa)"/><span>Fran Gomez de Villaboa</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>The unusual geological formation found in Wookey Hole’s Chamber 20 is usually only seen on the surface (Credit: Fran Gomez de Villaboa)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>Davranoglou and expedition leader, <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/james-kempton">James Kempton<!-- --></a> returned to the cave numerous times and on the third occasion, Kempton was alone underground scouting out routes for further exploration when the Earth began to shake.

You&#39;d see massive boulders tumbling down [the mountainside]. Then there was this massive earthquake, and [Kempton] was being shaken within an extremely narrow cavern that was full of boulders. Our students were waiting outside the cave with extreme fear to see if he would come out – they cried with happiness when he was safe.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>The team discovered <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.expeditioncyclops.org/biodiversity">a &#34;treasure trove&#34; of underground species<!-- --></a>, including blind spiders, blind harvestman and a whip scorpion – all new to science. &#34;We were absolutely elated because we discovered a hidden ecosystem that has so much potential.

Within just a couple of meters from the entrance, however, Short found himself abseiling 70m (230ft), carrying 40kg (88lbs) of diving equipment on his back. &#34;Down, and again, and again, and again. Eventually, after about 700m (2,300ft) of descent, we ended up at a small chamber where [previous team members] had hung hammocks. There was a stove and some supplies,&#34; says Short.<!-- --></p><p>At camp two, a tent had been prepared, and at camp three was the dive base.

Of a <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.usdct.org/j2_personnel_2013.php">team of 44 people from 15 different countries<!-- --></a>, now there were just two – Short and fellow explorer, Marcine Gala – alone, for nine days.<!-- --></p><p>After a further 600m (1,969ft) dive into the unknown, Short and Gala surfaced to hear the roar of a waterfall. &#34;We found this giant, beautiful multicoloured calcite curtain.
