<p id="speakable-summary">A court in India has ordered the blocking of encrypted email provider Proton Mail across the country.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Karnataka High Court directed the Indian government to block Proton Mail, a popular email service known for its enhanced security, following a legal complaint filed by New Delhi-based M Moser Design Associates. The local firm alleged that its employees had received emails containing obscene and vulgar content sent via Proton Mail.</p>







<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cnCfjfWGo_E?si=IP6J6aP31eX7EDkJ&amp;t=10419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tuesday hearing streamed on YouTube</a>, Justice M Nagaprasanna ordered the Indian government to “block Proton Mail, bearing in mind the observations made in the course of the order,” under the Information Technology Act 2008.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://karnatakajudiciary.kar.nic.in/newwebsite/casestatushck.php?params=UFdkQmZjM3lKOGY2TFZkZjkvNkVUdDJwWnVUZTFyOW9sSEgzYjdNcDNOZ0ZKY1JidGxnendDeUwxUWdmdlI2ZWpWbjFiWnpoNlNidEViaE5QS1NnK3c9PQ==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">complaint</a> filed in January, the New Delhi-based firm called for the regulation or blocking of Proton Mail in India, as the email service reportedly refused to share details about the sender of the allegedly offensive emails, despite a police complaint.</p>

<p>Additional solicitor general Aravind Kamath, representing the Indian government, had earlier told the high court that the government might have a limited role in addressing the petitioner’s concerns and suggested criminal courts could seek the required information from Swiss authorities since the petitioner had made a complaint.</p>

<p>The block of Proton Mail has yet to take effect, based on TechCrunch’s checks of Proton Mail’s website in India. TechCrunch contacted Proton Mail for comment and will update this story if we hear back.</p>

<p>This is the latest legal tussle facing Proton Mail in India, its second ruling in as many years aimed at blocking the encrypted email service from operating in the country.</p>

<p>Last year, the police department of the southern state of Tamil Nadu had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/india-may-block-proton-mail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sought to block</a> Proton Mail after the email service was found to have been used for sending hoax bomb threats to local schools. The Indian government’s IT ministry reportedly notified internet providers to block Proton Mail at the request of law enforcement. However, the Swiss federal authorities <a href="https://proton.me/blog/india-block-proton-mail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">intervened to prevent</a> the blocking of Proton Mail taking effect.</p>

<p>“Blocking access to Proton Mail simply prevents law-abiding citizens from communicating securely and does not prevent cybercriminals from sending threats with another email service, especially if the perpetrators are located outside of India,” Proton said at the time.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, in October 2024, the Delhi High Court <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-hc-questions-proton-mail-india-directs-mha-police-9660111/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">asked</a> state police and the Indian government’s home ministry to investigate the alleged use of Proton Mail across the country. Kamath, the additional solicitor general, had assured the Karnataka High Court that he would examine the Delhi High Court’s observations on Proton Mail’s use in India.</p>
