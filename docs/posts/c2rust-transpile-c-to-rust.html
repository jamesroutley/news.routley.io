    <h1>C2rust: Transpile C to Rust</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maintext">


<p>The C2Rust project is being developed by
<a href="https://galois.com">Galois</a> and
<a href="https://immunant.com">Immunant</a>. This tool is able to
translate most C modules into semantically equivalent
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> code. These
modules are intended to be compiled in isolation in order to produce
compatible object files. We are developing several tools that help
transform the initial Rust sources into idiomatic Rust.

</p><p>The translator focuses on supporting the C99 standard. C source code
is parsed and typechecked using
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org">clang</a> before being translated by our
tool.

</p><p>This project is available under the
<a href="https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/blob/master/LICENSE">BSD-3 license</a>.

</p><h2 id="Downloads">Downloads</h2>
<p>Source code and instructions are available in our
<a href="https://github.com/immunant/c2rust">git repository</a>.

</p><h2 id="Documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://c2rust.com/manual">C2Rust manual</a> is available online and is our
comprehensive documentation for using and developing C2Rust.

blog post:

</p><p>Per Larsen recently presented a talk on C2Rust at RustConf detailing
both our approach to translation as well as our <em>cross-checking</em>
approach to testing the resulting translations.

</p><p>Eric Mertens wrote a blog post describing some of the challenges
we encountered during translation of C to Rust and how C2Rust tackles
them.

  <dt>Host environment</dt>
  <dd>The translator is running on
      <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/">Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS</a> with
      x86_64 architecture.  With this approach to translation details of
      the host system&#39;s libraries can be embedded in the translation. The
      generated C code might not link correctly on other platforms.

<h2 id="FAQ">FAQ</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Why isn&#39;t my type definition translated?</dt>
  <dd>Types that aren&#39;t used to generate code are pruned away. Try using your
      type in a function declaration.</dd>
  <dt>Why isn&#39;t <em>printf</em> available?</dt>
  <dd>You&#39;ll need to include headers to use functions from external libraries.</dd>
  <dt>Why was my function omitted?</dt>
  <dd>When the translator can&#39;t handle a translating a function for some reason
      it omits the implementation and prints the reason. This is configurable
      and visible when you&#39;re running the tool locally. Currently this web
      interface doesn&#39;t show warning messages generated during translation.</dd>
  <dt>What are the known limitations?</dt>
  <dd>We&#39;ve captured many of the features we don&#39;t support on the
      <a href="https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/wiki/Known-Limitations-of-Translation">
      Known Limitations of Translation</a> wiki page.</dd>
