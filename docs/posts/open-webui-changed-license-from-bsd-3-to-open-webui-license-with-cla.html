    <h1>Open WebUI changed license from BSD-3 to Open WebUI license with CLA</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header></header><h2 id="keeping-open-webui-free-fair-and-sustainable">Keeping Open WebUI Free, Fair, and Sustainable<a href="#keeping-open-webui-free-fair-and-sustainable" aria-label="Direct link to Keeping Open WebUI Free, Fair, and Sustainable" title="Direct link to Keeping Open WebUI Free, Fair, and Sustainable">​</a></h2>
<p>If you&#39;ve been following Open WebUI’s journey, you know our mission has always been: empower everyone with cutting-edge AI, no strings attached. Open WebUI is an independent project, built and maintained by a small, dedicated core team. Over the last year, we’ve poured <strong>countless hours, late nights, and real financial resources</strong> into making this tool world-class—<strong>and we trust our users enough to keep it free and open</strong>.</p>
<p>But with Open WebUI’s rapid growth and success, we started seeing a pattern we couldn’t ignore: <strong>bad actors taking our work, stripping the branding, selling it as their own, and giving nothing back.</strong> That’s not open source—that’s exploitation. When organizations profit off our efforts, misrepresent our work, and box out the real community, it threatens the very spirit of what we’re trying to build.</p>
<p>That’s why we’ve acted: <strong>with Open WebUI v0.6.6+ (April 2025), our license remains permissive, BSD-3-based, but now adds a fair-use branding protection clause</strong>. This update does <strong>not</strong> impact genuine users, contributors, or anyone who simply wants to use the software in good faith. If you’re a real contributor, a small team, or an organization adopting Open WebUI for internal use—<strong>nothing changes for you</strong>. This change <strong>only affects those who intend to exploit the project’s goodwill</strong>: stripping away its identity, falsely representing it, and never giving back.</p>
<p>In plain terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open WebUI is still free, open source, and permissively licensed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You can still use, modify, and redistribute it for any purpose—just don’t remove or alter our branding unless you meet one of three clear criteria (see below).</strong></li>
<li><strong>The original BSD-3 license continues to apply for all contributions made to the codebase up to and including release v0.6.5.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We remain committed to transparency, openness, and supporting everyone—from hobbyists to enterprise. This is a “semi-copyleft” measure: we protect just the branding, to keep the project honest and sustainable; everything else is as free as you expect from open-source BSD.</p>
<p>We take your trust seriously. We want Open WebUI to stay <strong>empowering and accessible</strong>, <strong>driven by real community spirit</strong>—not gated, not locked-in, not co-opted by bad actors. We’re a small, lean team—but we care deeply about giving all our users the best experience and keeping our ecosystem clean and fair. <strong>Thank you for supporting us, and for caring about the future of open AI.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Effective with v0.6.6 (April 19, 2025):</strong></p>
<p>Open WebUI’s license is now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>BSD-3-Clause based</strong>, with an additional branding restriction clause:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You may NOT alter, remove, or obscure any “Open WebUI” branding</strong> (name, logo, UI marks, etc.) in any deployment or distribution, except in the circumstances below.</li>
<li>Branding must remain clearly visible, unless:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li><strong>You have 50 or fewer users</strong> in a 30-day period;</li>
<li><strong>You are a contributor</strong>, and have gotten written permission from us;</li>
<li><strong>You’ve secured an enterprise license</strong> from us which explicitly allows branding changes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All code submitted/merged to the codebase up to and including release v0.6.5 remains BSD-3 licensed</strong> (no branding requirement applies for that legacy code).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CLA required for new contributions</strong> after v0.6.5 (v0.6.6+) under the updated license.</p>
</li>

<h3 id="1-can-i-still-use-open-webui-freely-for-personal-projects-businesses-or-teaching"><strong>1. Can I still use Open WebUI freely for personal projects, businesses, or teaching?</strong><a href="#1-can-i-still-use-open-webui-freely-for-personal-projects-businesses-or-teaching" aria-label="Direct link to 1-can-i-still-use-open-webui-freely-for-personal-projects-businesses-or-teaching" title="Direct link to 1-can-i-still-use-open-webui-freely-for-personal-projects-businesses-or-teaching">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Yes!</strong> Just don’t remove or alter the “Open WebUI” branding, and you’re covered by the very permissive BSD-3-Clause plus our light branding protection. Just don’t pretend your distribution is “official” from us if it isn’t.</p>
<h3 id="2-i-want-to-fork-open-webui-and-change-the-ui-to-fit-my-use-case-is-that-allowed"><strong>2. I want to fork Open WebUI and change the UI to fit my use case.

<p><strong>Absolutely.</strong> You can change, extend, and customize the code or the user interface for your organization’s needs—but you’re required to keep “Open WebUI” branding visible <em>unless</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your deployment is for <strong>50 or fewer users in any 30-day window</strong>; or</li>
<li>You’re a recognized project contributor <strong>and</strong> have received written permission to adjust branding; or</li>
<li>You’ve secured an <strong>enterprise license</strong> with us that explicitly allows branding changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you remove or modify branding without meeting these criteria, that’s a material breach of the license.</p>
<h3 id="3-arent-these-clauses-contradictory-bsd-3-says-you-cant-use-your-name-to-promote-forks-but-also-requires-branding"><strong>3. Aren’t these clauses contradictory?

<p><strong>Good question!</strong> Our branding requirement means you <strong>mayn’t falsely promote</strong> your fork as “endorsed by” or “officially part of” Open WebUI (BSD-3-Clause, section 3)—but it <em>must</em> still acknowledge its origins for transparency.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You must keep “Open WebUI” branding visible (unless you qualify as detailed above).</strong></li>
<li><strong>You must clarify (in your documentation/about/landing) that it’s a fork, not the official version.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You may not imply endorsement by us</strong> for your derivative.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t contradictory—think of it as “must acknowledge, but not misrepresent.”<!-- --></p>
<h3 id="4-why-did-you-add-this-clause-isnt-open-source-supposed-to-be-fully-free"><strong>4. Why did you add this clause? Isn’t open source supposed to be fully free?</strong><a href="#4-why-did-you-add-this-clause-isnt-open-source-supposed-to-be-fully-free" aria-label="Direct link to 4-why-did-you-add-this-clause-isnt-open-source-supposed-to-be-fully-free" title="Direct link to 4-why-did-you-add-this-clause-isnt-open-source-supposed-to-be-fully-free">​</a></h3>
<p>We believe <strong>open source thrives on trust, transparency, and mutual respect</strong>. Open source is about sharing knowledge, empowering others, and building together—but it’s not about letting a handful of bad actors mislead and exploit the community for pure personal gain.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’ve actually seen, and why we had to act:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entities take the entire work of Open WebUI, quietly strip out all signs of our branding, then present the platform as if it&#39;s <strong>their own invention</strong>.</li>
<li>They market these rebranded solutions in commercial offerings to customers and organizations, sometimes at a massive markup.</li>
<li>Some go so far as to misleadingly imply their users are dealing with the people behind the original Open WebUI, creating confusion and false expectations about who maintains the software, where it comes from, and what kind of support is available.</li>
<li>When things break or customers need feature updates, these same groups turn around and <em>demand support from us—the original developers—<strong>while never having contributed a line of code, a helpful bug report, documentation, or any resources back to the project.</strong></em></li>
<li><strong>In effect, they extract value from the collective effort of independent contributors, misrepresent their role in the project, and give nothing back to the ecosystem or its sustainability.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s be clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not everyone who doesn’t contribute is a bad actor.</strong> Using Open WebUI “as is,” for internal or not-for-profit ways, is absolutely fine. We expect most users will never contribute code, and that’s totally fair—that’s how permissive open source works!</li>
<li><strong>But there is a line:</strong> When you start misleading your users about what you’re offering, exploiting the goodwill and energy of independent maintainers, and taking more than you give (especially when making money and actively denying credit), <strong>that’s not collaboration—that’s extraction and misrepresentation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This is especially demoralizing for us as a small, fully independent and self-funded team</strong>, working incredibly hard to keep Open WebUI both free and at the leading edge of AI. The reality is that open source isn’t “free” for the people building it: it takes huge time investments, personal sacrifice, ongoing infrastructure costs, and dedication. When our goodwill is taken advantage of, it directly threatens our ability to keep this project alive and thriving for everyone else.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>That’s why</strong> the new branding clause exists. It is a minimal, carefully scoped, and entirely rational measure:</p>
<ul>
<li>It preserves openness for genuine users and contributors—anyone can use, deploy, and even build commercial offerings as long as they respect transparency and our community’s work.</li>
<li>It prevents bad-faith actors from concealing our contributions or misleading users—protecting the project’s identity, trust, and reputation.</li>
<li><strong>Importantly, it also incentivizes individuals and organizations to actively contribute back to Open WebUI.</strong> When companies are required to credit and retain the original branding, it creates a virtuous cycle: they’re far more likely to participate in the project, propose improvements, submit bug fixes, contribute features, or start a conversation about open collaboration for everyone’s benefit.</li>
<li>This collective approach <strong>ensures that enhancements, security fixes, and new features are shared more openly, accelerating progress for the entire ecosystem—rather than being siloed in closed forks nobody else benefits from.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We want Open WebUI to remain <strong>free, empowering, and driven by honest spirit—protecting the project so it can serve everyone, not just those looking to exploit others’ effort for unearned gain.</strong> The <strong>branding protection clause targets only those edge-case exploiters</strong>—no one else’s experience is affected. It is our genuine attempt to keep our open-source community healthy, sustainable, and welcoming, while holding the project’s identity safe from predatory appropriation.</p>
<p>We’re not interested in “locking down” Open WebUI. If we have to revisit the license again, we’ll do it only if truly forced by an escalation of abuse—something we hope won’t happen, because our commitment remains with the wider community.</p>
<p>We remain as open, reasonable, and fair as ever—and we trust the community to do the right thing.</p>
<h3 id="5-im-a-real-contributor-do-these-restrictions-limit-my-rights"><strong>5. I’m a real contributor. Do these restrictions limit my rights?</strong><a href="#5-im-a-real-contributor-do-these-restrictions-limit-my-rights" aria-label="Direct link to 5-im-a-real-contributor-do-these-restrictions-limit-my-rights" title="Direct link to 5-im-a-real-contributor-do-these-restrictions-limit-my-rights">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>No.</strong> If your code was merged/included before v0.6.6, your rights/freedoms under BSD-3 are unchanged. If you want to contribute today, the BSD-3 basis remains, but you agree (via our CLA) to follow the fair-use branding provision (with more flexibility as a contributor).</p>
<p>If you contributed legacy code and now want it out (don’t want it covered by new branding requirement), we’ll <strong>promptly remove it at your request</strong> per the license.</p>
<h3 id="6-does-this-mean-open-webui-is-no-longer-open-source"><strong>6. Does this mean Open WebUI is “no longer open source”?</strong><a href="#6-does-this-mean-open-webui-is-no-longer-open-source" aria-label="Direct link to 6-does-this-mean-open-webui-is-no-longer-open-source" title="Direct link to 6-does-this-mean-open-webui-is-no-longer-open-source">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>No, not at all.</strong> Our code is fully public, the BSD-3-Clause freedom remains, and forks/contributions are always welcome. Our branding clause is a limited, semi-copyleft protection that only restricts misleading stripping of project identity. <strong>It’s still vastly more open (and less restrictive) than most commercial “open core” models.</strong></p>
<h3 id="7-what-if-i-want-to-white-label-or-deeply-customize-open-webui-for-my-enterprise"><strong>7.

<p>Anything pre-0.6.6 is pure BSD-3—<strong>these branding limits didn’t exist</strong>. The new branding clause applies only to future versions/releases; retroactive enforcement is not possible.</p>
