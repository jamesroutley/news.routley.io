    <h1>Show HN: DeepSeek My User Agent</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1">DeepSeek R1</a> is a new model and service that exposes
chain-of-thought to the user. You can use it live for free at
<a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/">chat.deepseek.com</a>, or via an API at
<a href="https://platform.deepseek.com/">platform.deepseek.com</a> that is currently significantly less
expensive than OpenAI o1. OR, simply click <code>Judge Me</code> to see what the model thinks about your user
agent, browser capabilities, and IP location headers. If you dare.</p>

<p>Well it was good while it lasted. Shortly after this article was published, the DeepSeek API started
having issues. Here‚Äôs the time since this article released: grey means the user got judged, red
means failure.</p>

<p>And now, <a href="https://platform.deepseek.com/">platform.deepseek.com</a> is returning 404, and
<a href="https://status.deepseek.com/">status.deepseek.com</a> shows a red banner. Only one conclusion can be
drawn: DeepSeek My User Agent has brought down DeepSeek üíÄ.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42834648">best judgements</a> on Hacker News. They
are prioritizing chat, so I‚Äôve displayed the prompt below when you click ‚ÄúJudge Me‚Äù so you can just
copy/paste it to <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/">chat.deepseek.com</a>, a true DIY roast approach.</p>
