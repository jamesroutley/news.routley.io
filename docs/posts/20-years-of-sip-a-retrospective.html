				<p>June of 2022 marks the twentieth anniversary – yes – TWENTIETH – of the publication of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), documented in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261" target="_blank">RFC 3261</a>. When it was published in June of 2002, it set records for the longest specification produced by the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/" target="_blank">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a>, at 269 pages. The IETF produces the technology standards that make the Internet work. Protocols like IP, TCP and HTTP – all now part of mainstream vernacular – came out of the IETF. It was a monumental effort to produce, involving a dedicated author team (shown below) that worked full time for months to ensure that the specifications were correct, consistent and complete. I had the great fortune to be the lead author of this document, an accomplishment which was the defining moment for my career.</p>  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.jdrosen.net/uploads/1/5/0/0/15008848/sip-authors_orig.jpg" alt="Picture"/> </a></p><p>The RFC3261 author team – left to right, top to bottom: Robert Sparks, Jon Peterson, Alan Johnston, Allison Mankin, Jonathan Rosenberg, Gonzalo Camarillo, and Henning Schulzrinne. </p> </div></div>  <div><p>In the 20 years (and almost countless extensions to SIP) that followed, it is hard to dispute that SIP has been a major success. At its core, SIP enabled the transformation of the telecommunications industry from one based on hardware, to one based on software – colloquially known as Voice over IP (VoIP). A 20th anniversary is the ideal time for a retrospective, to consider both its positives and negatives. On the plus side, this transformation resulted in the re-engineering of the phone network, the creation of new markets and market categories, and the creation of jobs and livelihoods. On the negative side, it has exacerbated the scourge of robocalling.  </p></div>
