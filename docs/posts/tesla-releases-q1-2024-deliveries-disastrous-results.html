<p>Tesla has released its Q1 2024 delivery and production numbers: confirming the suspicion that it is not growing anymore.</p>



<p>It’s even worse than most people anticipated.</p>



<h2 id="h-tesla-q1-2024-expectations">Tesla Q1 2024 Expectations</h2>



<p>As we have been reporting in the last few weeks,<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/03/28/tesla-tsla-delivery-estimates-all-over-the-place/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the expectations for Tesla’s Q1 2024 deliveries are all over the place</a>.</p>



<p>Last month, the Wall Street consensus was around 470,000 deliveries, but it has been consistently revised down over the last few weeks as many of them now expect quite a disastrous quarter compared to the previous one.</p>



<p>As of today, the consensus is 431,000 deliveries.</p>



<p>In comparison, Tesla had record deliveries of 484,507 vehicles last quarter for a 20% year-over-year growth rate, and it delivered 422,875 in Q1 2023.</p>



<p>431,000 deliveries would still be a small growth year-over-ear, but it would be a massive quarter-to-quarter drop.</p>



<h2 id="h-tesla-q1-2024-delivery-and-production-results">Tesla Q1 2024 Delivery and Production Results</h2>



<p>Today, Tesla released its official Q1 2024 delivery and production results – confirming 386,810 deliveries for the first quarter of the year.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td> </td><td><strong>Production</strong></td><td><strong>Deliveries</strong></td><td><strong>Subject to operating lease accounting</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Model 3/Y</td><td>412,376</td><td>369,783</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Other Models</td><td>20,995</td><td>17,027</td><td>1%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td>433,371</td><td>386,810</td><td><strong>2%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Tesla listed several excuses for the big delivery miss:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Decline in volumes was partially due to the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory and factory shutdowns resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin.</p>
</blockquote>




	<p>Tesla’s stock dropped by as much as 7% in pre-market trading following the release.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>This is next-level bad. Even the most pessimistic analysts didn’t come close to predicting this level of deliveries.</p>



<p>All these excuses that Tesla is listing are good excuses, but they are good for the lower production levels. They don’t explain the ~50,000-vehicle discrepancy between production and deliveries. That’s a demand problem. As clear as it gets.</p>



<p>I think this should be a wake-up call. This is Tesla going back about two years in terms of demand.</p>
