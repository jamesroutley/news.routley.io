    <h1>My lazy Wordle strategy: same words every time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p><em>TL;DR: After the analysis in this post, I started using <code>SLANT</code> <code>PRICE</code> <code>DOUGH</code> <code>BALMY</code>, but it may not be the best sequence for you.</em></p>
<p>There are lots of great videos and articles on the optimal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wordle</a> strategy. I particularly enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this YouTube video</a> by 3Blue1Brown on using the information theory to come up with the best guesses.</p>
<p>But I can‚Äôt play like that. First, I‚Äôm lazy, and second, my slow human brain can‚Äôt do information theory calculations or depth-first searches.</p>
<p>Instead, every time I play Wordle, I enter the same sequence of words until it feels like there aren‚Äôt many solutions left, at which point I try to make more tailored guesses.</p>
<p>Here are a couple examples of my recent games:</p>


<p>Until today, my go-to words were <code>STALE</code>, <code>CHIRP</code>, <code>MOUND</code>, and <code>GAWKY</code>, picked mostly by gut feel while trying to check as many frequently used letters as possible. So far I‚Äôve been doing alright with them.</p>
<h2 id="But-can-we-do-better"><a href="#But-can-we-do-better" title="But can we do better?"></a>But can we do better?</h2><p>Yes! Let‚Äôs use math and programming to do better.</p>
<p>Though to do computer science, we‚Äôll need a more precise algorithm than ‚Äúplay these words until it feels like there aren‚Äôt many solutions left‚Äù. Let‚Äôs go with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick four words.</li>
<li>In every game, keep guessing these words in order.</li>
<li>If there are 3 or fewer possible solutions left, make tailored guesses that minimize the number of turns to victory. </li>
</ol>
<p>Oh, and let‚Äôs use only the list of 2309 valid solution words (heplfully provided in Wordle‚Äôs JavaScript source code), and ignore the larger list of valid guesses. In part, that‚Äôs to make the calculations simpler, and in part because you‚Äôll forget that <code>THEWY</code> is an acceptable guess by the time you‚Äôll finish reading this sentence.</p>
<h2 id="Pick-words-that-produce-fewest-remaining-possible-solutions"><a href="#Pick-words-that-produce-fewest-remaining-possible-solutions" title="Pick words that produce fewest remaining possible solutions?"></a>Pick words that produce fewest remaining possible solutions?</h2><p>That was the first thing I tried. </p>
<p>For the first word, I picked one that resulted in the lowest remaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information entropy</a> (basically, fewest remaining options) on average across any of the 2309 valid solutions. That turned out to be <code>RAISE</code>.</p>
<p>Then, I picked the next word that gave me (on average, across all solutions) the most information after guessing <code>RAISE</code>. That turned out to be <code>CLOTH</code>. And so on, getting <code>DUMPY</code> and <code>BEGAN</code> as the best third and fourth words.</p>
<p>(Along the way, I had to keep in mind that I had to switch to ‚Äúsmart‚Äù guesses if I had 3 or fewer valid solutions left.)</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what each word contributed:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Guess</th>
<th>Ave. remaining entropy (bits)</th>
<th>Ave. options remaining</th>
<th>Worst case options remaining</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>RAISE</code></td>
<td>5.2</td>
<td>17.5</td>
<td>167</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>CLOTH</code></td>
<td>1.8</td>
<td>2.38</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>DUMPY</code></td>
<td>0.8</td>
<td>1.53</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>BEGAN</code></td>
<td>0.4</td>
<td>1.28</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>But how does it compare to the original <code>STALE</code>&gt;<code>CHIRP</code>&gt;<code>MOUND</code>&gt;<code>GAWKY</code>? If we simulate all 2309 possible games we see that:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>RAISE</code> <code>CLOTH</code> <code>DUMPY</code> <code>BEGAN</code> wins all games and uses 3.89 guesses on average.</li>
<li>My original <code>STALE</code> <code>CHIRP</code> <code>MOUND</code> <code>GAWKY</code> wins all games and uses 3.84 (!) guesses on average.</li>
</ul>
<p>üò≤ ‚ÅâÔ∏è My original gut-feel word choices did better? </p>
<h2 id="Because-each-word-being-optimal-‚â†-the-full-set-is-optimal"><a href="#Because-each-word-being-optimal-‚â†-the-full-set-is-optimal" title="Because each word being optimal ‚â† the full set is optimal"></a>Because each word being optimal ‚â† the full set is optimal</h2><p>So it turns out it‚Äôs not enough to optimize each word; instead, we have to jointly optimize the entire sequence <code>WORD1</code> <code>WORD2</code> <code>WORD3</code> <code>WORD4</code> across all possible word sequences.</p>
<p>But that‚Äôs a lot of sequences! I‚Äôm not sure how much exactly 2309<sup>4</sup> is, but it‚Äôs definitely more than my computer can handle. Even doing some intelligent pruning (e.g. ‚Äòa letter must not repeat in the first 3 words‚Äô) still leaves a lot of options to evaluate. What else can we do to cut it down?</p>
<p>What I ended up doing was ranking all words by the number of bits of information that they provide, picking the top 10-100 words at each position for a total of ~160,000 four-word combinations, and then simulating all possible games for each sequence.</p>
<p>After two days at 100% CPU, my computer gave me the answer:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SLANT</code> <code>PRICE</code> <code>DOUGH</code> <code>BALMY</code>: 3.79991 average guesses to win.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there were a lot of other sequences that produced similar results. For example #2 sequence was <code>CRANE</code> <code>SPILT</code> <code>DOUGH</code> <code>BALMY</code> that took on average 3.8008 guesses to win. </p>
<h2 id="But-what-if-I‚Äôm-a-smart-and-tailor-my-guesses-sooner"><a href="#But-what-if-I‚Äôm-a-smart-and-tailor-my-guesses-sooner" title="But what if I‚Äôm a smart and tailor my guesses sooner?"></a>But what if I‚Äôm a smart and tailor my guesses sooner?</h2><p>Or, to be less flippant, you can often get into situations where there are more than three guesses left, but you can easily enumerate them. The simplest example is if your first guess <code>SHARE</code> results in something like <span>S</span><span>H</span><span>A</span><span>R</span><span>E</span>.</p>
<p>So let‚Äôs say that we start making tailored guesses when there are five possible solutions left instead of three. How does this change our optimal sequence?</p>
<p>After another day at 100% CPU, I ended up with <code>TRICE</code> <code>SALON</code> <code>DUMPY</code> <code>GLOBE</code>, which solved the puzzle in  3.72 steps on average. </p>
<p>But <code>SLANT</code> <code>PRICE</code> <code>DOUGH</code> <code>BALMY</code> wasn‚Äôt far behind, at 3.74 average guesses, and even the original <code>STALE</code> <code>CHIRP</code> <code>MOUND</code> <code>GAWKY</code> clocked in at respectable 3.79 guesses.</p>
<h2 id="But-what-if-the-word-list-changes"><a href="#But-what-if-the-word-list-changes" title="But what if the word list changes?"></a>But what if the word list changes?</h2><p>That‚Äôs a good question. It wouldn‚Äôt do to have a set of words that‚Äôs hyper-optimized for Wordle but not other similar puzzles.</p>
<p>So I took the list of <a href="https://github.com/possibly-wrong/word-frequency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">words ranked by their occurrence in Google Books</a>, and selected top 3000 five-letter words.</p>
<p>Redoing the same analysis here gives us a new winner: <code>SAINT</code> <code>BORED</code> <code>CLUMP</code> <code>FIGHT</code> at 3.91 guesses to win, though again, <code>SLANT</code> <code>PRICE</code> <code>DOUGH</code> <code>BALMY</code> is not far behind with 3.96 guesses (athough with 99.93% win rate), and even my original <code>STALE</code> <code>CHIRP</code> <code>MOUND</code> <code>GAWKY</code> comes in at a not-terrible 3.98 average guesses and 99.90% win rate.</p>
<h2 id="So-what‚Äôs-the-lesson"><a href="#So-what‚Äôs-the-lesson" title="So what‚Äôs the lesson?"></a>So what‚Äôs the lesson?</h2><p>So it turns out that the <em>most</em> optimal sequence really depends on how you play the game and which Worlde-like game you play. </p>
<p>But if you want a good-enough sequence, it looks like you can pick any three words that cover the most frequently used letters, and then a fourth word that complements the other three well.</p>
<p>Personally, I think I‚Äôll try <code>SLANT</code> <code>PRICE</code> <code>DOUGH</code> <code>BALMY</code> for the next while.</p>
