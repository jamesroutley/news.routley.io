    <h1>I recorded user behaviour on my competitor’s websites (2018)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
<p>Google’s team has tracked down my test site, most likely using the source code I shared and de-indexed the whole domain.</p>
<h2>My wish list:</h2>
<p>a) Manipulating the back button in Chrome shouldn’t be possible in 2018</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Here’s what I did:</h2>
<ol>
<li>User lands on my page (referrer: google)</li>
<li>When they hit “back” button in Chrome, JS sends them to my copy of SERP</li>
<li>Click on any competitor takes them to my mirror of competitor’s site (noindex)</li>
<li>Now I generate heatmaps, scrollmaps, records screen interactions and typing.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Generate heatmaps (clicks, moves, scroll depth)</li>
<li>Record actual sessions (mouse movement, clicks, typing)</li>
</ul>
<p>I gasped when I realised I can actually <strong>capture all form submissions and send them to my own email</strong>.</p>
<h2>Wouldn’t a website doing this be penalised?</h2>
<p>You would think so.</p>
<h2>Alternative Technique</h2>
<p>You don’t have to spoof Google SERPs to generate competitor’s heatmaps, you can simply A/B test your landing page VS your clone of theirs through paid traffic (e.g. social media). Is the A/B testing version of this ethically OK? I don’t know, but it may get you in legal trouble depending on where you live.</p>
<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
<p>Users seldom read home page “fluff” and often look for things like testimonials, case studies, pricing levels and staff profiles / company information in search for credibility and trust. One of my upcoming tests will be to combine home page with “about us”, “testimonials”, “case studies” and “packages”. This would give users all they really want on a single page.</p>
<h2>Reader Suggestions</h2>
<p>“I would’ve thrown in an exit pop-up to let users know what they’d just been subjected to.”</p>
