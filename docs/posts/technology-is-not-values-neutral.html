<p>We fail to take tech seriously when we do not grasp its full impact on humans.</p>
<p ;="">The undeniable impact of “Big Tech” on humanity in recent decades should lead us to ask fundamental questions about technology<sup id="textref-1"><a href="#fn-1" title="go to footnote">[1]</a></sup>. Exponential rates of technological change have brought the cutting edge of advanced technology into the heart of everyday experience. Rather than serving primarily in the background for labor or infrastructure, technological advances are in the immediate foreground—in the palm of our hands—central to the most intimate and consequential aspects of our lives, including education, communication, relationships, and politics. In recent decades, societies have been fundamentally transformed by the innovations of a relatively small number of technologists. The products and services of the modern digital economy continue to bring technology ever closer to the core of the human experience—and “the digital age” is just getting started.</p>
<h4>Values are Baked Into Technologies</h4>
<p ;="">Consider the smartphone and all the technologies that have interfaced and co-evolved with it. In 2022, the smartphone requires at least the basic capabilities of a personal computer, as well as the Internet, server farms, microchip supply chains, Wi-Fi, cameras, lenses, microphones, speakers, software apps, and communications satellites. Most phones are augmented with wearable biometric sensors, headsets, and may be linked to everything from your car to your washing machine. An ever-growing assortment of related innovations increase the smartphone’s power and presence in our lives.</p>
<p>A GPS device on your phone is designed to get you where you need to go, and it does that. It was not designed to weaken your sense of direction and make you dependent upon it to feel safe in urban or rural areas. Yet it also does that.</p>
<p ;="">In fact, the changes to human psychology and social reality resulting from smartphone technology ecosystems are intrinsic to the possibilities built into them from the start. Technologies always create the potential for new forms of behavior, values, and thought, even when the technology is not explicitly made to do so. Smartphones were designed with the values of communication and access to information in mind. The smartphone has become central to human existence because humans highly value communication and information. But an inevitable result of enabling communication at a distance is a change in how humans value face-to-face interaction. Instant messaging and “Facetime” have come to replace in-person contact as the default modalities of communication. Easy access to nearly unlimited information also inevitably changes the value we place on skills such as memorization, information recall, and the ability to study and learn from books. A GPS device on your phone is designed to get you where you need to go, and it does that. It was not designed to weaken your sense of direction and make you dependent upon it to feel safe in urban or rural areas. Yet it also does that. What value is there now in having a good sense of direction or in being able to give and remember directions and locations? This may seem trivial, but it is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Technologies are created with both values and material outcomes in mind. When technologies are brought into the world they create a future: material, social, psychological, and cultural.</p>
<p ;="">Technologies are created with both values and material outcomes in mind. When technologies are brought into the world they create a future: material, social, psychological, and cultural. This future inevitably escapes the control of the early inventors, implementers, and adopters. Even a technology as simple as the plow is created with values in mind, such as ease of labor, speed of work, and a desire for food surpluses that create a feeling of safety. It serves these values by affecting material outcomes, such as preparing fields for agriculture. The plow would also lead to urban fortifications for storing and protecting food surpluses, and thus change the nature of human habitats, warfare, and architecture. The plow favors men as farmers due to the upper body strength needed to use it, which changed ideologies about the respective value of the sexes. The plow led eventually to certain forms of animal domestication, in the long run altering the relationship between humans and the natural world, and thus moving religious beliefs from animistic to theocentric. Normalization of animal-drawn plowing as the basis of agriculture made it difficult for humans to value animals as sacred and as equal or surpassing humans in worth. It is hard to worship the sacred spirit of an animal that must be beaten all day to pull a plow. Dominion over animals in this way justified the spread of a cultural narrative that humanity’s role is to control nature, rather than to be a part of nature, which laid the foundations for a mindset that eventually resulted in the industrial revolution. These and countless other changes to human minds, behaviors, and culture followed from the invention of the plow.</p>

<h4>Technology, Ideology, and the Shape of Civilizations</h4>
<p ;="">Ideologies supporting the proliferation (and goodness) of technology began to drown out conservative (mostly religious) moral resistance by the 19th century. Instead, the zeitgeist shifted toward a faith in technology as either positive or neutral with regards to human nature. Contemporary techno-optimists<sup id="textref-6"><a href="#fn-6" title="go to footnote">[6]</a></sup> have continued with the ideology of the inherent positivity of technology, which is now further supported with a postmodern perspective that may be summarized as “skeptical of universal values in general.” The argument is that technologies are only as bad or good as the people who use them. Moreover, cross-cultural standards of value (good versus bad) are suspect in postmodernism—therefore considering technology in terms of values is itself questionable. According to this view, technology is about what works for everyone—universal <em>functionality</em>—rather than what is good for everyone—universal <em>morality</em>.</p>
<p>Techno-optimists largely maintain that technology is about what works for everyone—universal functionality—rather than what is good for everyone—universal morality.</p>
<p ;="">It may be reasonable to summarize Facebook’s approach as: “our technology connects people; what they do after that is up to them.”<sup id="textref-7"><a href="#fn-7" title="go to footnote">[7]</a></sup> This is an abnegation of responsibility for the impacts of technology. It is an ideology that places the onus of right action on “users&#39;&#39; rather than on designers. But this kind of thinking is understandable and can be powerfully convincing under certain circumstances. When a technology is designed to solve a real and urgent problem, and it works as intended, it can result in widespread uptake among the population. This leads people to the understandable conclusion that it is a <em>good thing</em>. The goodness of the technology feels obvious, particularly when the second- and third-order effects that some users may experience only become evident later or in other domains. To many, it appears that the technology itself is not an issue—it is simply up to people to use it responsibly.</p><figure><img src="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Layers-of-the-Civilizational-Tech-Stack_1.jpg" alt="a graphic discussing the Layers of the Civilizational Tech Stack   Consider the categories below as overlapping; this overall model is only a heuristic. There are a variety of comparable stacks proposed in the academic literature, many of which have influenced the model presented here. This is not proposed as definitive, but as a useful set of orienting generalizations.    Tools: Human-scale artifacts, found or made, which augment individual and social practices: rocks, axes, forks, writing implements, etc.   Technologies: The application of complex (scientific) knowledge to solving problems, embedded in intentionally designed artifacts that are complicated enough to require engineering: waterwheel; steam engine; light bulb; refrigerator.    Ecologies of technologies: Sets of technologies that are symbiotically related and co-evolving as nested functional units: e.g., light bulb/lamp/power lines/transformers/power station; and microchip/hard drive/screen/mouse/modem/broadband/server banks.       Infrastructures: Multiple different ecologies of technology embedded together to form a basic part of social coordination and material reproduction within a society: supply chains, transportation systems, markets, communication systems.   Technological epochs: A duration of historical time characterized by a specific suite of infrastructures that are interrelated as the foundation of a social system. Epochs are marked by discontinuous breaks from prior infrastructures, and the emergent social dynamics resulting from new ones: e.g. pre-industrial; industrial; post-industrial." loading="lazy" width="2000" height="3580" srcset="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Layers-of-the-Civilizational-Tech-Stack_1.jpg 600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Layers-of-the-Civilizational-Tech-Stack_1.jpg 1000w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1600/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Layers-of-the-Civilizational-Tech-Stack_1.jpg 1600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Layers-of-the-Civilizational-Tech-Stack_1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Box 1</figcaption></figure><h4>Evolutions of Design Thinking</h4>
<p ;="">As the development of modern technologies began to accelerate, there was an accompanying evolution of thought regarding the process of innovation—particularly in terms of how technology should be made, its impacts, and the overall goals and dynamics of its creation. Below, we suggest a few broad categories of the various positions and worldviews that have been adopted throughout the evolution of the modern world system. These categories are not mutually exclusive and should not be understood as empirically grounded sociological constructs—they are offered simply as a means to clarify the complex dynamics of contemporary culture. </p>
<figure><img src="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Tenets-of-Winner-s--Technological-Orthodoxy-_1.jpg" alt="a graphic discussion Tenets of Winner’s “Technological Orthodoxy” Comprehension: Humans fully understand the technologies they create. Control: Our tools are firmly under our control. Neutrality: Technologies themselves are neutral. Technological benefits and harms depend on how humans use them. Progress: Technological infrastructures require complex, large-scale, high-energy, highly resource-demanding systems; to continue building and perfecting such systems is itself a definition of ‘progress.’" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1859" srcset="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Tenets-of-Winner-s--Technological-Orthodoxy-_1.jpg 600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Tenets-of-Winner-s--Technological-Orthodoxy-_1.jpg 1000w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1600/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Tenets-of-Winner-s--Technological-Orthodoxy-_1.jpg 1600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w2400/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Tenets-of-Winner-s--Technological-Orthodoxy-_1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>*please see footnote 9 for references</figcaption></figure><p ;="">“Technological orthodoxy” entails a strict separation of values from technology. In part, this is related to understanding value itself as primarily socially constructed. This idea began with modernist scientific materialism. The assumption that physical matter constitutes all that exists leaves no room for “subjective qualities” such as value. This idea—that value is purely subjective—reached its climax with postmodernist expressions of skepticism towards all universal frameworks of value. The result has been a progressive deepening of the separation of technology design from considerations of value. Thinking about design in this way leads innovators to “move fast and break things” and focus effort on “disruptive” technologies. Whereas naively optimistic design made the assumption that technology could advance sacrosanct values, nihilistic design decoupled technological innovation from any serious considerations about value at all. The consequences of this approach are likely to be both far-reaching and difficult to understand completely.</p>
<p>As a way forward, we propose here a form of axiological design: design that factors and leverages the intrinsic values inevitably encoded in all technology-human interfaces.</p>
<p ;="">As a way forward, we propose here a form of <strong><em>axiological design</em></strong>: design that factors and leverages the intrinsic values inevitably encoded in all technology-human interfaces. This is design that acknowledges that in addition to whatever its physical impacts, it is also affecting the behaviors and thus the psychology of the people using it (and with proliferation, the society as a whole). As such, technological innovations must have design goals and constraints related to the psychological and sociological effects as core elements of the design process.</p>
<p>Instead of assuming technology is either good or bad by definition (as with naive and luddite design respectively), technology should be understood as intrinsically value laden and value creating.</p>
<figure><img src="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Approaches-to-Design_1.jpg" alt="Approaches to Design   Naively Optimistic Design — Emerging during early modernism, this is design that assumes positive values are intrinsically encoded in all technology-human interfaces.   Luddite Design — Reacting against the “machine age,” this form of design seeks to undo or roll back technological advancements, based on the assumption that negative values are intrinsically encoded into all technology-human interfaces.   Nihilistic Design — Resulting from the conditions of postmodernism, this is design that ignores or down-plays value as an aspect of technology-human interfaces.   Axiological Design  — Responding to the multiple crises and challenging planetary conditions of late modernity—including existential risk—this is design that factors and leverages the intrinsic value inevitably encoded in all technology-human interfaces." loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2562" srcset="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Approaches-to-Design_1.jpg 600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Approaches-to-Design_1.jpg 1000w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1600/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Approaches-to-Design_1.jpg 1600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/06/Tech-Neutral_Approaches-to-Design_1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Box 2</figcaption></figure><h4>Insights From Design Science</h4>
<p ;="">Of course, we are not the first to suggest this direction for design science. Design ethics has been a relevant topic since the modern world began to look towards technology as formative and essential, and design approaches factoring values, psychology and ethics have had a resurgence in recent years. Technologists have promoted a range of overlapping approaches including (but not limited to) user-centered design, usable design, human-centered design, value-sensitive design, worth-centered design, ontological design, and more.<sup id="textref-10"><a href="#fn-10" title="go to footnote">[10]</a></sup> Some of the insights and conclusions from these fields are summarized in the following five propositions about technology:</p>
<ol type="“1”">
<li>Technology is created in pursuit of values, and results in the creation and transformation of values.</li>
<li>Technology requires the creation of more and different technology; multiple new technologies evolve together as functionally bound sets, forming evolving ecologies of technologies.</li>
<li>Technology shapes our bodies and movements as a human-created habitat, and thus is deeply habit forming, both for individuals and societies.</li>
<li>Technology changes the nature of power dynamics in unpredictable ways, creating an environment that advantages some humans over others, setting up selection pressures that force personal adaptation to and adoption of new technologies.</li>
<li>Technology impacts the kinds of ideas we value, the quality of attention we pay, and our conceptions of self and world.</li>
</ol>
<p ;="">The <strong>first proposition</strong> above explains that values are built into technologies, while also following from their use. Technology is value-loaded: it comes with values built in. It is also values altering: technologies change and augment existing value systems. These two dynamics are related but not deterministic. We saw this above with the example of the smartphone and the plow. It is quite common that the values guiding the design of a technology are different from the value system changes that result from its widespread use. For example, the intention behind social media (aside from making money) is to bring people closer together. Yet research shows that heavy users of social media feel more isolated and disconnected from others, and that they value human relationships less than lighter users. Recall that the smartphone technology ecosystem appears to be in many ways undermining individual psyches, families, governments, markets, and cultures—all mediated through effects on human minds and behavior. None of this was intended.</p>
<p>Sometimes, adopting a new technology becomes basically obligatory. Technology creates a need for itself; it makes itself valuable.</p>
<p ;="">At first the smartphone technology ecosystem was primarily for communication between small numbers of people. It was not that different from a previously normal phone, familiar to humans for a century. You could therefore take it or leave it without disadvantage. However, as this technology saturated social reality and the scope and impact of the technology became exponentially greater, it became massively disadvantageous not to have a smartphone. This is a slippery slope of self-reinforcing technology adoption, and this is a feature that characterizes almost all technologies. As technology spreads there is a cascade of new social pressures that reconfigure existing personalities, worldviews, and value systems. Sometimes, adopting a new technology becomes basically obligatory. Technology creates a need for itself; it makes itself valuable.</p><figure><img src="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/06/Tech-Values-Neutral_3.jpg" alt="a keyboard stylized in the shape of an x against a backdrop of green grass" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/Tech-Values-Neutral_3.jpg 600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/Tech-Values-Neutral_3.jpg 1000w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1600/2022/06/Tech-Values-Neutral_3.jpg 1600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w2400/2022/06/Tech-Values-Neutral_3.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>copyright: Adaptive Cultures</figcaption></figure><h4>The Future of Axiological Design</h4>
<p ;="">If we are to design a humane future beyond our current technology stack, we must begin to create technologies with these five propositions as core design principles. Second- and third-order effects on values, culture, power, and personality must be given due consideration. We can no longer limit ourselves to thinking only about the impacts across material economies, finance, and ecology. The question of how this might work at scale is still being explored.</p>
<p>Technology is intrinsic to our being and becoming as individuals and social systems.</p>
<p ;="">An awareness that the five propositions above are true should result in the realization that humanity is currently in a dangerous place. Technology is intrinsic to our being and becoming as individuals and social systems. The rapid emergence and saturation of digital technologies—largely based upon fast-paced nihilistic design—has resulted in what might be called an <em>accidental planetary computational stack.</em><sup id="textref-15"><a href="#fn-15" title="go to footnote">[15]</a></sup> This means that the technological environments we find ourselves in, with their visible and invisible effects on our bodies, minds, cultures, societies, and ecosystems, did not result from design. They were not even significantly influenced by holistic considerations. Instead, the habitats and environments in which we live now emerged as the result of many varied local developments, driven largely by near-term market forces, with little consideration for the longer-term consequences. Technological innovation by the state has decreased in favor of private industry, alongside financial deregulation and the emergence of venture capital as the driving force for new technology development. </p>
<p>Future technologies must be designed according to methods that take human value and experience seriously enough to be constrained by their limits—such as sanity, dignity, and justice.</p>
<p ;="">If we are to establish this approach to the multi-domain impacts of ecologies of technologies, we must consider the design of technologies at all scales. Ecologies of technologies emerge in the context of existing social dynamics, such as inequality, conflict, and the usual games of power, money, and status. At one level certain technologies seem to favor the distribution of power and the freedom of users, yet at another these same technologies prove disproportionately useful for those who already have the resources and intelligence to take further advantage. While in principle everyone may have access to supercomputing via the cloud, in reality this “decentralized service” tends to further advantage those already most advantaged. Multinational corporations and governments can use cloud capabilities to accomplish massive outcomes—such as ubiquitous surveillance and the processing of big data—whereas everyday people use it to store their photos and music.</p>
