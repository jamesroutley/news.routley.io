    <h1>Apache ECharts 6</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----> <div><article> <p>Twelve years ago, ECharts was first released on GitHub, planting the seed for an open-source journey.</p> <p>From a simple charting tool to a visualization powerhouse supporting millions of developers; from a single front-end charting library to a comprehensive technology system covering mobile, large screens, and server-side rendering—over these 12 years, we&#39;ve witnessed ECharts&#39; continuous technical breakthroughs and have been delighted to see developers worldwide create countless stunning data stories with ECharts.</p> <p>Now, Apache ECharts 6.0 is officially released, bringing 12 major upgrades to take your data visualization to the next level.</p> <h2 id="feature-overview" tabindex="-1">Feature Overview</h2> <p>Twelve years of accumulation, all for more ultimate visual expression. The core strength of Apache ECharts has always come from a deep understanding of developers&#39; real challenges. When defining the direction for 6.0, the question was clear: <strong>How can we make complex data presentation both powerful and elegant?</strong></p> <p>This drove us to evolve deeply around three core dimensions:</p> <ul><li><strong>More professional visual presentation</strong>: From a meticulously crafted default theme to intelligent dark mode switching, ensuring charts have a professional look and seamlessly integrate into modern applications.</li> <li><strong>Expanding the boundaries of data expression</strong>: New chart types and features to handle complex scenarios and enable intuitive expression of deep data.</li> <li><strong>Unleashing freedom of composition</strong>: From the revolutionary matrix coordinate system to reusable custom series and optimized axis labels—empowering developers to freely compose and turn creativity into unconstrained visual works.</li></ul> <p>We have made 12 upgrades across these three core dimensions. These are not just simple feature additions, but a solid foundation for building the next generation of data-driven applications. They all point to one goal: <strong>to make ECharts powerful, reliable, and stable in the background, leaving the stage and spotlight for your creative expression.</strong></p> <p>Below, we introduce these twelve upgrades in detail:</p> <ul><li><strong>More professional visual presentation</strong> <ul><li><strong>1. Brand New Default Theme</strong>: Modern design language for professional data expression</li> <li><strong>2. Dynamic Theme Switching</strong>: Seamless runtime theme switching for multi-theme scenarios</li> <li><strong>3. Dark Mode Support</strong>: Automatically adapts to system dark/light mode for better UX</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Expanding the boundaries of data expression</strong> <ul><li><strong>4. New Chord Chart</strong>: Visualize complex relationships and distributions</li> <li><strong>5. New Beeswarm Chart</strong>: Smartly expand overlapping data points into a honeycomb layout</li> <li><strong>6. New Scatter Jittering</strong>: Add jitter to scatter plots for better readability of dense data</li> <li><strong>7. New Broken Axis</strong>: Easily present data with large magnitude differences</li> <li><strong>8. Enhanced Stock Trading Charts</strong>: Improved label capabilities and more out-of-the-box trading charts</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Unleashing freedom of composition</strong> <ul><li><strong>9.

New Custom Charts</strong>: Violin, contour, stage, bar range, and line range charts</li> <li><strong>12. Axis Label Optimization</strong>: Smarter default axis label layout to prevent overflow and overlap</li></ul></li></ul> <p>With these upgrades, Apache ECharts 6.0 helps users create more charts more flexibly and conveniently, truly achieving &#34;unlimited possibilities in charting&#34;!</p> <h2 id="feature-details" tabindex="-1">Feature Details</h2> <h3 id="1.-brand-new-default-theme" tabindex="-1">1. Brand New Default Theme</h3> <p>During the development of ECharts 6.0, we analyzed real user scenarios and found that over 70% of developers use the default theme. This made us realize: an excellent default theme should not only be aesthetically pleasing but also meet the general needs of various business scenarios.</p> <p>The new theme system uses design tokens to reconstruct colors, spacing, and other design elements, <strong>making different chart types and components more harmonious and consistent</strong>.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/1-default-theme.png" width="600px"/> <p>Although the 6.0 theme has significant changes from 5.x, we provide a <a href="https://github.com/apache/echarts/blob/master/theme/v5.js">v5.js</a> theme file for developers who want to use new features but keep the old style for quick migration.</p> <h3 id="2.-dynamic-theme-switching" tabindex="-1">2. Dynamic Theme Switching</h3> <p>In previous versions, changing a chart&#39;s theme required disposing of the chart instance and re-initializing, which could negatively impact user experience due to repeated animations. In the new version, we implemented <strong>dynamic theme switching</strong> (see documentation), significantly improving the user experience.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/2-switch-themes.gif" width="600px"/> <h3 id="3.-dark-mode-support" tabindex="-1">3. Dark Mode Support</h3> <p>With dynamic theme registration and switching, a typical scenario is <strong>listening to the system&#39;s dark mode and dynamically adjusting the chart&#39;s theme</strong>.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/3-responsive-themes.gif" width="600px"/> <p>This is crucial for business scenarios supporting dark mode, ensuring the application interface matches the system theme and greatly enhancing user experience.</p> <p>Here&#39;s how to listen for system dark mode and change the chart theme:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> darkModeMediaQuery <span>=</span> window<span>.</span><span>matchMedia</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&#39;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div> <!----> </div> <h3 id="4.-new-chord-chart" tabindex="-1">4. New Chord Chart</h3> <p>Chord charts intuitively show flows and weights in complex relationship networks, ideal for scenarios like financial transactions and social networks. ECharts innovatively supports <strong>using gradient colors from source and target nodes for edges, creating unique visual effects</strong>. See <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#series-chord">series-chord</a>.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/4-chord.gif" width="600px"/> <h3 id="5.-new-beeswarm-chart" tabindex="-1">5. New Beeswarm Chart</h3> <p>Traditional scatter plots can become overcrowded on category axes. Beeswarm charts use non-numeric axis offsets to <strong>distribute points without overlap while preserving value axis accuracy</strong>. Set <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#xAxis.jitter">jitter</a> to a non-zero value and <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#xAxis.jitterOverlap">jitterOverlap</a> to <code>false</code> to enable beeswarm charts.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/5-beeswarm.png" width="600px"/> <h3 id="6.-new-scatter-jittering" tabindex="-1">6. New Scatter Jittering</h3> <p>Scatter jittering adds random offsets to non-data dimensions, <strong>solving the problem of overly dense data points</strong>.</p> <p>Without jittering, it&#39;s hard to see the distribution when data is dense:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/6-jittering-off.png" width="600px"/> <p>With jittering enabled, the densest range (6-8) becomes clear. Compared to beeswarm, scatter jittering offers better performance.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/6-jittering-on.png" width="600px"/> <p>Set <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#xAxis.jitter">jitter</a> to a non-zero value and <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#xAxis.jitterOverlap">jitterOverlap</a> to <code>true</code> to enable scatter jittering.</p> <h3 id="7.-new-broken-axis" tabindex="-1">7. New Broken Axis</h3> <p>Broken axis is a visualization technique for showing data with large magnitude differences. In ECharts 6.0, we innovatively implemented a <strong>torn-paper effect for broken axes</strong>, making the meaning more intuitive, and supporting click-to-expand to restore the real data ratio.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/7-break-axis.gif" width="600px"/> <h3 id="8.-enhanced-stock-trading-charts" tabindex="-1">8. Enhanced Stock Trading Charts</h3> <p>ECharts 6.0 deeply optimizes for financial trading scenarios, enhancing label positioning relative to coordinate systems to help developers quickly build professional-grade trading analysis tools.</p> <p>Below is a comprehensive stock trading chart using ECharts, combining <strong>time-sharing, MACD, volume, order book, and depth chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/8-stock.png" width="600px"/> <p>These examples help developers quickly meet financial trading needs. For example, displaying numbers in the four corners of the chart can be achieved with <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/en/basics/release-note/v6-feature/$%7BoptionPathseries-line.markPoint.data.relativeTo">relativeTo</a>.</p> <h3 id="9.-new-matrix-coordinate-system" tabindex="-1">9. New Matrix Coordinate System</h3> <p>The above example also uses the new matrix coordinate system in ECharts 6.0, which is very powerful. It can be used for covariance matrix charts:</p>  <p>Periodic table:</p>  <p>As a layout, it also allows developers to combine various chart types and components to create flexible and complex visualizations:</p>  <h3 id="10.-enhanced-custom-series" tabindex="-1">10. Enhanced Custom Series</h3> <p>Previously, using ECharts custom series meant developers had to write complex <code>renderItem</code> logic from scratch, and code reuse was limited to copy-pasting. Now, ECharts 6.0 brings a standardized, reusable solution:</p> <ul><li><strong>Custom series registration</strong>: Like theme registration, custom series can be dynamically registered and used as easily as built-in series. See <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#series-custom.renderItem">series-custom.renderItem</a></li> <li><strong>Official custom series project</strong>: The official project at <a href="https://github.com/apache/echarts-custom-series">https://github.com/apache/echarts-custom-series</a> provides multiple custom series, available via npm after the official release</li> <li><strong>Publish your own custom series</strong>: Submit a pull request to the above project or publish to your own repo for code reuse</li></ul> <h3 id="11.-new-custom-charts" tabindex="-1">11. New Custom Charts</h3> <p>This release provides 6 practical custom charts in the custom series project. See <a href="https://github.com/apache/echarts-custom-series">echarts-custom-series</a> for usage and documentation. Including <strong>violin chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-violin.png" width="600px"/> <p><strong>Contour chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-contour.png" width="600px"/> <p><strong>Sleep stage chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-stage.png" width="600px"/> <p><strong>Segmented doughnut chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-segmentedDoughnut.png" width="600px"/> <p><strong>Bar range chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-barRange.png" width="600px"/> <p><strong>Line range chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-lineRange.png" width="600px"/> <p>Unleash your creativity and join us in creating more custom charts!</p> <h3 id="12.-axis-label-optimization" tabindex="-1">12. Axis Label Optimization</h3> <p>In previous versions, axis labels and names in rectangular coordinate systems could easily overflow or overlap when data was long. Users couldn&#39;t always predict space needs as data changed. In this version, we&#39;ve optimized the default strategies to prevent overflow and overlap.</p> <h2 id="upgrade-guide" tabindex="-1">Upgrade Guide</h2> <p>See the full <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/changelog.html#v6-0-0">changelog</a> and <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/en/basics/release-note/v6-feature/v6-upgrade-guide">upgrade guide</a>.</p></article></div></div></div>
