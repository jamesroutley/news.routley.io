  <p>Last month I was invited to talk at the Second <a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2023/">Interdisciplinary Workshop on Reimagining Democracy (IWORD 2023)</a> at the Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation. </p><p>I’m trying to think of how to describe this gathering… I had fun and met many lovely people with interesting ideas around governance, representation, voice, power. I shared some new work and research around privacy-preserving data governance, covering:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>emerging privacy and cryptography tools and frameworks</p></li><li><p>models for data collectives, e.g. data trusts, data coops, data commons </p></li><li><p>interfaces for data consent and collective consent</p></li><li><p>models beyond “ownership” and “control”  </p></li><li><p>community research and co-design </p></li></ul><p>A summary and detailed notes of the workshop can be found on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/01/second-interdisciplinary-workshop-on-reimagining-democracy.html">Bruce Schneier’s blog</a> as well. </p><p>My personal highlights include meeting and befriending more sci-fi and speculative fiction writers, learning about community efforts to amend the constitution (which I didn’t consider as a possibility!), chatting with a privacy lawyer, discussing possible models for collective consent, thinking about new frameworks for data governance, and, as always, being in community with others excited to build and collaborate together.</p><p>I’ve also been thinking about: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>the Creative Commons as a model for the digital commons</p></li><li><p>open source as digital public infrastructure </p></li><li><p>cryptography enabling data sharing in a way that can be <em>both open and private</em> </p></li><li><p>governance archaeology and ethnographic approaches to collective governance </p></li><li><p>consent as relational, networked consent </p></li><li><p>“What do we collectively want, and how do we build this shared future?” </p></li></ul><p>Below are the slides from my talk, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HR97wf0DxBaYI8TaEQi-EBYrdAr9aqvUFyoPeC6oKUM/edit?usp=sharing">here’s a link to them</a> as well if you’d like to see my notes.</p>
