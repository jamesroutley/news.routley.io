    <h1>Writing Javascript without a build system</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>Hello! I’ve been writing some Javascript this week, and as always when I start
a new frontend project, I was faced with the question: should I use a build
system?</p>

<p>I want to talk about what’s appealing to me about build systems, why I
(usually) still don’t use them, and why I find it frustrating that some
frontend Javascript libraries require that you use a build system.</p>

<p>I’m writing this because most of the writing I see about JS assumes that
you’re using a build system, and it can be hard to navigate for folks like me
who write very simple small Javascript projects that don’t require a build
system.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-a-build-system">what’s a build system?</h3>

<p>The idea is that you have a bunch of Javascript or Typescript code, and you
want to translate it into different Javascript code before you put it on your
website.</p>

<p>Build systems can do lots of useful things, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>combining 100s of JS files into one big bundle (for efficiency reasons)</li>
<li>translating Typescript into Javascript</li>
<li>typechecking Typescript</li>
<li>minification</li>
<li>adding polyfills to support older browsers</li>
<li>compiling JSX</li>
<li>treeshaking (remove unused JS code to reduce file sizes)</li>
<li>building CSS (like <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">tailwind</a> does)</li>
<li>and probably lots of other important things</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this, if you’re building a complex frontend project today, probably you’re using a build system like webpack, rollup, esbuild, parcel, or vite.</p>

<p>Lots of those features are appealing to me, and I’ve used build systems in the past for some of these reasons: <a href="https://messwithdns.net/">Mess With DNS</a> uses <code>esbuild</code> to translate Typescript and combine lots of files into one big file, for example.</p>

<h3 id="the-goal-easily-make-changes-to-old-tiny-websites">the goal: easily make changes to old tiny websites</h3>

<p>I make a lot <a href="https://css-examples.wizardzines.com/">of</a> <a href="https://questions.wizardzines.com">small</a> <a href="https://sql-playground.wizardzines.com/">simple</a> <a href="https://nginx-playground.wizardzines.com/">websites</a>, I have approximately 0 maintenance energy for any of them, and I change them very infrequently.</p>

<p>My goal is that if I have a site that I made 3 or 5 years ago, I’d like to be able to, in 20 minutes:</p>

<ul>
<li>get the source from github on a new computer</li>
<li>make some changes</li>
<li>put it on the internet</li>
</ul>

<p>But my experience with build systems (not just Javascript build systems!), is
that if you have a 5-year-old site, often it’s a huge pain to get the site
built again.</p>

<p>And because most of my websites are pretty small, the <em>advantage</em> of using a
build system is pretty small – I don’t really need Typescript or JSX. I can
just have one 400-line <code>script.js</code> file and call it a day.</p>

<h3 id="example-trying-to-build-the-sql-playground">example: trying to build the SQL playground</h3>

<p>One of my sites (the <a href="https://sql-playground.wizardzines.com/">sql playground</a>) uses a build system (it’s using Vue). I last edited that project 2 years ago, on a different machine.</p>

<p>Let’s see if I can still easily build it today on my machine. To start out, we have to run <code>npm install</code>. Here’s the output I get.</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install

</code></pre>

<p>There’s some kind of error building <code>grpc</code>. No problem. I don’t
really need that dependency anyway, so I can just take 5 minutes to tear it out
and rebuild. Now I can <code>npm install</code> and everything works.</p>

<p>Now let’s try to build the project:</p>

<pre><code>$ npm run build

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69692842/error-message-error0308010cdigital-envelope-routinesunsupported">This stack overflow answer</a> suggests running <code>export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider</code> to fix this error.</p>

<p>That works, and finally I can <code>npm run build</code> to build the project.</p>

<p>This isn’t really that bad (I only had to remove a dependency and pass a slightly mysterious node option!),
but I would rather not be derailed by those build errors.</p>

<h3 id="for-me-a-build-system-isn-t-worth-it-for-small-projects">for me, a build system isn’t worth it for small projects</h3>

<p>For me, a complicated Javascript build system just doesn’t seem worth it for
small 500-line projects – it means giving up being able to easily update the
project in the future in exchange for some pretty marginal benefits.</p>

<h3 id="esbuild-seems-a-little-more-stable">esbuild seems a little more stable</h3>

<p>I want to give a quick shoutout to esbuild: I <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/11/15/esbuild-vue/">learned about esbuild in 2021</a> and used for a project, and
so far it does seem a more reliable way to build JS projects.</p>

<p>I just tried to build an <code>esbuild</code> project that I last touched 8 months ago on
a new computer, and it worked. But I can’t say for sure if I’ll be able to
easily build that project in 2 years. Maybe it will, I hope so!</p>

<h3 id="not-using-a-build-system-is-usually-pretty-easy">not using a build system is usually pretty easy</h3>

<p>Here’s what the part of <a href="https://nginx-playground.wizardzines.com/">nginx playground</a> code that imports all the libraries looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=&#34;js/vue.global.prod.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;codemirror-5.63.0/lib/codemirror.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;codemirror-5.63.0/mode/nginx/nginx.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;codemirror-5.63.0/mode/shell/shell.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;codemirror-5.63.0/mode/javascript/javascript.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; href=&#34;codemirror-5.63.0/lib/codemirror.css&#34;&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;script.js &#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This project is also using Vue, but it just uses a <code>&lt;script src</code> to load Vue –
there’s no build process for the frontend.</p>

<h3 id="a-no-build-system-template-for-using-vue">a no-build-system template for using Vue</h3>

<p>A couple of people asked how to get started writing Javascript without a build
system. Of course you can write vanilla JS if you want, but my usual framework
is Vue 3.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jvns/vue3-tiny-template">Here’s a tiny template I built</a>
for starting a Vue 3 project with no build system. It’s just 2 files and ~30 lines of HTML/JS.</p>

<h3 id="some-libraries-require-you-to-use-a-build-system">some libraries require you to use a build system</h3>

<p>This build system stuff is on my mind recently because I’m using CodeMirror 5
for a new project this week, and I saw there was a new version, CodeMirror 6.</p>

<p>So I thought – cool, maybe I should use CodeMirror 6 instead of CodeMirror 5.
But – it seems like you can’t use CodeMirror 6 without a build system (according to <a href="https://codemirror.net/docs/migration/">the migration guide</a>). So I’m going to stick with CodeMirror 5.</p>

<p>Similarly, you used to be able to just download Tailwind as a giant CSS file,
but <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation">Tailwind 3</a> doesn’t seem to be available as a
big CSS file at all anymore, you need to run Javascript to build it. So I’m
going to keep using Tailwind 2 for now. (I know, I know, you’re not supposed to use the big CSS file, but it’s only 300KB gzipped and I really don’t want a build step)</p>

<p>(edit: it looks like Tailwind released a <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli">standalone CLI</a> in 2021 which seems like a nice option)</p>

<p>I’m not totally sure why some libraries don’t provide a no-build-system version
– maybe distributing a no-build-system version would add a lot of additional
complexity to the library, and the maintainer doesn’t think it’s worth it. Or
maybe the library’s design means that it’s not possible to distribute a
no-build-system version for some reason.</p>

<h3 id="i-d-love-more-tips-for-no-build-system-javascript">I’d love more tips for no-build-system javascript</h3>

<p>My main strategies so far are:</p>

<ul>
<li>search for “CDN” on a library’s website to find a standalone javascript file</li>
<li>use <a href="https://unpkg.com">https://unpkg.com</a> to see if the library has a built version I can use</li>
<li>host my own version of libraries instead of relying on a CDN that might go down</li>
<li>write my own simple integrations instead of pulling in another dependency (for example I wrote my own CodeMirror component for Vue the other day)</li>
<li>if I want a build system, use esbuild</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of other things that look interesting but that I haven’t looked into:</p>

<ul>
<li>this <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/a-proposal-for-type-syntax-in-javascript/">typescript proposal for type syntax in Javascript comments</a></li>
<li>ES modules generally</li>
</ul>
