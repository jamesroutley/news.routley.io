	<p>Commercial and industrial applications like lighting require large-scale, low-power device networks where thousands of devices need to communicate with one another efficiently, reliably and securely. Commissioning and maintenance of such networks must also be easy and efficient in order to reduce the total cost of ownership. Bluetooth mesh 1.1 is the latest edition on the Bluetooth SIGâ€™s mesh networking standard and it introduces a plethora of new features addressing the needs and challenges of large commercial networks including for example: standardized OTA updates, remote provisioning, certificate-based provisioning and directed forwarding. Silicon Labs is one of the key contributors to the development and implementation of Bluetooth mesh standard.</p>
