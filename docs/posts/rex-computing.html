                            <hr/>
                            <p>Software development is an important part of the Neo architecture roadmap. The REX software team is working hard to build an easy-to-use modern toolchain to simplify writing new Neo applications and porting existing software to our platform.<br/></p>
                            <p>A fundamentally new hardware environment brings about several exciting</p>
                            <h5>Memory Management</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Neo’s impressive power efficiency relies on many simplifications at the hardware level. As a result, our runtime environment must meet unique requirements to ensure the task of memory management is abstracted away from users without needing complicated garbage collection or language restrictions.</li>
                                <li>The primary space for storing program code and data on Neo is made up of Scratchpad Memory. In other words, our chip does not need all of the logic required for hardware managed caching and coherency that you might find in existing processors and accelerators. Instead, we place a local memory space inside each of our cores that is lower power and lower latency (faster) than traditional caches, giving the REX Neo architecture a significant power and performance advantage over other architectures.</li>
                                <li>Our team shared an update on new techniques at the MEMSYS 2015 conference. You can access our paper 
                                    <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2818966">here</a>.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>General Programmability</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Architectures that try to achieve goals similar to the Neo chip often rely on application-specific simplifications. For example, GPUs (graphics processing units) are great for tasks like video rendering and machine learning, but are not nearly as competent at running a web browser or operating system as a CPU (central processing unit). Similarly, DSP (digital signal processor) chips are often challenging to program and may rely on hardware accelerators to achieve efficient performance in many applications.  We are not immune from these challenges, but are instead taking a different approach.</li>
                                <li>Our hardware simplifications are focused on exposing low level functionality. Rather than designing to provide higher level interfaces to programmers, which would require making many assumptions about workload characteristics, we strip away abstractions and implement them in software. Once a feature exists in software, it can easily be enabled or disabled at will, or even modified as application requirements change. Our hardware and software development teams work together very closely to strike a balance between extreme efficiency and reconfigurability.</li>
                                <li>Neo does not force software to adhere to any one programming model. Flexibility of execution modes and access to time-predictable atomic core-to-core messaging can support a variety of higher level models.
                                    </li>

                                    <p dir="ltr"><span><span>SAN</span> <span>FRANCISCO</span> – July 21, 2015 – REX Computing, a <span>San</span> <span>Francisco</span> fabless semiconductor startup developing high performance energy-efficient computer processors, announced today that it has raised $1.25 million in seed funding led by FF Science, a vehicle of Founders Fund that invests in companies pushing the boundaries of difficult scientific and engineering challenges. The new capital will support continued development and deployment of REX’s new, hyper-efficient and general purpose processor aiming to deliver</span><span> </span><span>a 10 to 25x increase in energy efficiency compared to the current state-of-the-art.</span></p>
                                    
                                    <p dir="ltr"><span>“It has been decades since the industry that gave Silicon Valley its name - the business of semiconductors and microprocessors - has managed to produce anything beyond incremental innovation, myopically chasing the Moore&#39;s law curve.” said Aaron VanDevender, Chief Scientist at Founders Fund. “REX is rethinking the integrated the computing stack---hardware and software---to produce dramatic improvements in energy efficiency. If we want ubiquitous supercomputing, we can&#39;t wait for Moore. We need REX.”</span></p>
                                    
                                    <p dir="ltr"><span>REX Computing was founded in 2013 by Thomas Sohmers and Paul Sebexen following their selection as Thiel Fellows by Silicon Valley investor and philanthropist Peter Thiel. Sohmers started REX to break through barriers in power efficiency and programmability of large-scale computer systems. REX’s Neo architecture is the first solution solving these problems plaguing all areas of computing by targeting the key area contributing to power usage in processors: the memory system. Processors typically require 40 times more energy to exchange data with local memory than performing useful computational work with that data; over 60% of this energy usage is dissipated in the processor’s hardware-managed cache hierarchy. The Neo architecture addresses these problems by removing unnecessary complexity from hardware, resulting in smaller chip area and less power consumption, instead providing similar functionality more efficiently in a rich software toolchain. </span></p>
                                    
                                    <p dir="ltr"><span>“We’ve discovered a major flaw in processor design that has persisted for 20 years. Memory movement is the largest consumer of power and the biggest bottleneck in a modern processor, but the industry has primarily focused on improving raw performance, ignoring the efficiency of data movement.” said Sohmers. “Simply tweaking and patching longstanding chip architectures as industry incumbents have already done will not give us the kind of energy efficiency or performance increases needed to effectively continue Moore’s law. We have rethought computing architecture from the ground up to design our Neo chip, featuring a completely new core design including software managed scratchpad memory, 256 cores per chip, a mesh network-on-chip and a high bandwidth chip-to-chip interconnect.”</span></p>
                                    
                                    <p dir="ltr"><span>The REX Neo processor is targeting 256 GFLOPs of double precision floating point performance with the package and power budget of a smartphone-class processor. The 64 double precision GFLOPs per watt efficiency metric is over 10 times more efficient than the best processors available today. REX is working with early customers in fields related to digital signal processing, image processing, computer vision, machine learning, and other computationally-intensive application spaces, and expects first silicon shipping to customers in 2016.</span></p>
