    <h1>Ask HN: How do you safely give LLMs SSH/DB access?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have been using Claude Code for DevOps style tasks like SSHing into servers, grepping logs, inspecting files, and querying databases</p><p>Overall it&#39;s been great. However, I find myself having to review every single command, a lot of which are repetitive. It still saves me a ton of time, but it&#39;s quickly becoming a bit tedious</p><p>I wish I could give the agent some more autonomy. Like giving it a list of pre-approved commands or actions that it is allowed to run over ssh</p><p>For example:</p><pre><code>    OK: ls, grep, cat, tail
    Not OK: rm, mv, chmod, etc
    OK: SELECT queries
    Not OK: INSERT, DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE
</code></pre><p>
Has anyone successfully or satisfactorily solved this?</p><p>What setups have actually worked for you, and where do you draw the line between autonomy and risk?</p></div></div></div>
