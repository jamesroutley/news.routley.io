    <h1>Ukraine accepted to NATO cyber defence centre</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-v-301db0d5=""><div data-v-301db0d5=""><p><strong>This week, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) held its 30th Steering Committee. With a unanimous vote, the 27 Sponsoring Nations in the Steering Committee of the CCDCOE agreed to Ukraine’s membership in the NATO CCDCOE as a Contributing Participant.</strong></p>
<p>“Ukraine’s presence in the Centre will enhance the exchange of cyber expertise, between Ukraine and CCDCOE member nations. Ukraine could bring valuable first-hand knowledge of several adversaries within the cyber domain to be used for research, exercises and training,” emphasized Col Jaak Tarien, Director of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.</p>
<p>“Capability and knowledge comes from experience, and Ukraine definitely has valuable experience from previous cyber-attacks to provide significant value to the NATO CCDCOE. Estonia as a Host Nation of the CCDCOE has been a long-term partner for Ukraine in enhancing its cyber security capacity and cyber resilience and we welcome the decision of the members of CCDCOE agreeing to Ukraine’s membership,” commented Minister of Defence of Estonia Kalle Laanet.</p>
<p>After Ukraine sent a letter to confirm its remaining interest in joining NATO CCDCOE as a Contributing Participant, their membership was put on the vote in the Steering Committee of the CCDCOE. The Centre has already expanded its memberships outside the NATO-nations.</p>
<p>The CCDCOE is a NATO-accredited cyber knowledge hub, research institution, and training and exercise facility. The Tallinn-based international military organisation focuses on interdisciplinary applied research, as well as consultations, training and exercises in the field of cyber security.</p>
