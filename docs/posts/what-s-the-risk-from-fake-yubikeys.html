    <h1>What&#39;s the risk from fake Yubikeys?</h1>

<p>I found this on a security-related Slack (shared with permission).</p><p><img src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Fake.png" alt="" width="703" height="134"/></p><p>It launched an entertaining discussion about the risks of taking a <em>potentially</em> fake FIDO token.</p><p>We all know the risks of taking a free USB drive and shoving it in our computer, right?</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/free-usb-stick.png" alt="Meme in the style of &#34;You Wouldn&#39;t Download A Car&#34; saying &#34;You wouldn&#39;t take a free USB stick." width="975" height="418"/></p><p>USB sticks can install software, act as a <a href="https://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/usb-hardware-keyloggers-1-keycarbon">keylogger</a>, transmit <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/02/18/wifi-hides-inside-a-usb-cable/">data over WiFi</a>, and even <a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/usb-killer-how-to-protect-your-devices/">physically damage the electronics</a>!</p><p>So a USB Yubikey could do all those things - but could it do anything malicious as an MFA token?</p><p>And - at the risk of invoking Cunningham&#39;s law - I think the answer is a cautious &#34;<strong>no</strong>&#34;.</p><p>Other than the risks inherent in any USB device, what&#39;s the worst that could happen? A cloned device <em>might</em> let an attacker have a duplicate key. But that&#39;s useless unless they also have your username and password.</p><p>A device with a built in transmitter <em>might</em> send an OTP to an attacker but, again, useless without the other authentication factors.</p><p>The devices could be set up to deliberately fail - or be revoked. That could work as a denial of service attack against users. But most services allow you to have a backup authentication method.</p><p>There may be some sites which <em>only</em> use a token for login - eschewing passwords - but that&#39;s rare, I would hope.</p><p>A Yubikey can be <a href="https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/how-to-weaponize-the-yubikey/">hacked to send arbitrary keystrokes</a> - but that&#39;s of limited usefulness. I guess an attacker could force open a browser window to download malicious software, but that would be fairly obvious to a user.</p><p>So, go on then, prove me wrong. What&#39;s the worst thing that can be done with a compromised Yubikey?</p></div></div>
