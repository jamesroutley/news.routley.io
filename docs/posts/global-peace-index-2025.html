                    <p>Produced by the <a href="https://www.economicsandpeace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Institute for Economics and Peace</a> (IEP), the Global Peace Index (GPI) is the world’s leading measure of global peacefulness. This report presents the most comprehensive data-driven analysis to-date on trends in peace, its economic value, and how to develop peaceful societies. The Global Peace Index covers 99.7% of the world’s population, and is calculated using <a href="https://www.visionofhumanity.org/chart-of-the-week-indicators-of-peace/">23 qualitative and quantitative indicators</a> from highly respected sources, and measures the state of peace across three domains:</p>
<p>– the level of Societal Safety and Security,</p>
<p>– the extent of Ongoing Domestic and International Conflict,</p>
<p>– and the degree of Militarisation.</p>

                    <h3>Key Findings from the the Global Peace Index 2025</h3>                </p>

                <div>
                    <p>The 2025 Global Peace Index (GPI) reveals a continuing decline in global peacefulness, with many key indicators that precede major conflicts higher than at any time since World War II. Rising conflict deaths, accelerating geopolitical tensions, and middle power assertiveness are driving ‘The Great Fragmentation’ – a fundamental reshaping of the global order and marking the emergence of a new geopolitical era. When combined with major power competition, asymmetric warfare technologies, and mounting debt in fragile economies, the prospect for further conflict is high.</p>
<p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>● Global peace is at its lowest level since the inception of the Index, while the conditions that precede conflict are the worst since WWII.</li>
<li>● Global peacefulness has deteriorated every year since 2014, with 100 countries deteriorating over the last decade.</li>
<li>● There are currently 59 active state-based conflicts – the most since the end of WWII, with 152,000 conflict-related deaths recorded in 2024.</li>
<li>● There were 17 countries with over 1,000 internal conflict deaths in 2024, the highest since 1999, and a further 18 countries that recorded over 100 deaths.</li>
<li>● The world is at an inflection point, with global influence and power fragmenting.</li>
<li>● The number of globally influential countries has nearly tripled since the end of the Cold War, rising from 13 to 34 by 2023.</li>
<li>● Conflicts are becoming more internationalised, with 78 countries involved in conflicts beyond their borders in 2024.</li>
<li>● The global economic impact of violence reached $19.97 trillion in 2024, equivalent to 11.6% of global GDP, with military expenditure alone accounting for $2.7 trillion.</li>
<li>● Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Austria and Switzerland are the top 5 <a href="https://www.visionofhumanity.org/10-most-peaceful-countries-in-the-world-in-2025/">most peaceful countries in the world in 2025</a>.</li>
</ul>

                    <h3>Key Trends in the Global Peace Index 2024</h3>                </p>

                    <p>The Global Peace Index 2024 reveals that the world is at a crossroads. Without concerted effort, there is a risk of a surge in major conflicts. There are currently 56 conflicts, the most since World War II. They have become more international with 92 countries involved in conflicts outside their borders, the most since the GPI’s inception. The rising number of minor conflicts increases the likelihood of more major conflicts in the future. For example, in 2019, Ethiopia, Ukraine, and Gaza were all identified as minor conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Key results<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>• 97 countries deteriorated in peacefulness, more than any year since the inception of the Global Peace Index in 2008.</p>
<p>Last year recorded 162,000 conflict related deaths. This was the second highest toll in the past 30 years, with the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza accounting for nearly three-quarters of deaths. Ukraine represented more than half, recording 83,000 conflict deaths, with estimates of at least 33,000 for Palestine up to April 2024. In the first four months of 2024, conflict related deaths globally amounted to 47,000. If the same rate continues for the rest of this year, it would be the highest number of conflict deaths since the Rwandan genocide in 1994.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Global Peace Index 2022 results show that the average level of global peacefulness deteriorated by 0.03%. Although slight, this is the eleventh deterioration in peacefulness in the last fourteen years, with 90 countries improving, 71 deteriorating and two remaining stable in peacefulness, highlighting that countries tend to deteriorate much faster than they improve.</p>
<p>• Deaths from external conflict recorded a sharp deterioration driven by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>
