    <h1>Paper mills: the &#39;cartel-like&#39; companies behind fraudulent scientific journals</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds"><em>Science</em></a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03464-x"><em>Nature</em></a>, two leading science journals, have revealed a growing problem: an alarming rise in fraudulent research papers produced by shady <a href="https://blog.mdpi.com/2022/05/09/paper-mills/">paper mill companies</a>. This  wave of fake studies is creating a major headache for the academic world, putting the integrity of global academic research at risk.</p>

<p><a href="https://publicationethics.org/publishers-perspective-paper-mills">Paper mill companies</a> offer authorship services to researchers, academics, and students who want their names listed as an author of a scientific article published in reputable scientific journals.</p>

<p>By paying around <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1574">€180 to €5000</a> (approximately US$197 - $5472), a person can have their name listed as the author of research paper, without having to painstakingly do research and write the results. No doubt, some experts refer to these paper mills as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514363/">illegal and criminal organizations</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1574">A 2023 research highlights</a> a dramatic increase in fraudulent scientific artiles traced back to paper mills. In just five years, the numbers of retractions soared <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1574">jumped</a> from 10 in 2019 to 2,099 in 2023.</p>

<p>Paper mills have also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00159-9">extremely overwhelmed</a> major scientific journal publishers. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">Hindawi and Wiley, publishers of open access journals in the UK</a>, for example, retracted around 1,200 paper mill articles in 2023. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/15/journal-retracts-122-papers-at-once/">SAGE, a global publisher of books, journals and academic library resources</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/28/exclusive-elsevier-retracting-500-papers-for-shoddy-peer-review/">Elsevier, a scholarly publisher in the Netherlands</a> also retracted hundreds of paper mill articles in 2022.</p>

<p>Paper mills are found operating in countries whose research policies incentivise researchers to produce as many scientific articles as possible, such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5">China</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1574">Russia</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/03/the-situation-has-become-appalling-fake-scientific-papers-push-research-credibility-to-crisis-point">India</a> and <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/04/02/karimipour-saga-i-setting-boundaries/">Iran</a>.</p>

<p>However, their customer profile is quite diverse, from both developed and developing countries, including <a href="https://majalah.tempo.co/read/nasional/171351/academic-misconduct-guru-besar">Indonesia</a>, <a href="https://cen.acs.org/policy/publishing/Malaysia-wont-pay-researchers-publish/101/i35">Malaysia</a>, <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/12/14/german-authorities-on-papermills-and-whistleblowing/">Germany</a>, and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/meeting/house/115022/documents/HHRG-117-SY21-20220720-SD002.pdf">the United States (US)</a>.</p>

<p>Based on research data and investigative journalist reports from the last five years, I summarise how these paper mills operate and how to detect them.</p>

<h2>The paper mill playbook: tactics and oddities</h2>

<p><strong>1. Problematic articles</strong></p>

<p>Paper mills generally manipulate <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-022-06198-9">the process of publishing scientific articles</a>. These articles usually <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9759E2D516E7F26C9064ACF2CD3E6D#1">plagiarise other published articles</a>, contain <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C289EF83FBEC1823EACF837A600198#4">false</a> and stolen data, or include engineered and duplicated images.</p>

<p>They also offer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1DAA212C13697D91953FC9835DEB61">to rewrite scientific articles</a> using generative artificial intelligence tools, such as <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://quillbot.com">Quillbot</a>, or to translate published articles from other languages into English.</p>

<p><strong>2. A promised path to publication</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9703783/">some cases</a>, paper mills  offer authorship slots before an article is accepted for publication. </p>

<p>In other cases, they offer authorship slots after the article is ready to be published by the journal.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is not uncommon for paper mills to sell authorship slots <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1574">with a guarantee</a> that the article will definitely be published. In fact, according to the conventions generally accepted in the academic community, no well-run journal can <a href="https://www.editage.com/insights/how-can-i-get-an-acceptance-letter-for-my-paper">give such a guarantee</a>.</p>

<p>Publishing decisions are normally made only after editors have considered the feedback from peer reviewers. This means, there is no possibility for a manuscript to secure acceptance before passing the peer review process.</p>

<p><strong>3. Fake reviews and corrupt deals</strong></p>

<p>Paper mills also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9703783/">offer a wide range of additional services</a>. For example, they offer <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ddns/2023/9784576/">fake peer review</a> services to convince potential buyers that the offered articles have passed rigorous review.</p>

<p>To smooth the way for their operations, some paper mills even operate like a cartel, bribing rogue journal editors to ensure publication. <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">A 2024 investigation by a <em>Science</em> journalist</a> revealed that some scientific journal editors were offered as much as $20,000 to cooperate with these schemes. This investigation resulted in <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">more than 30 editors of reputable international journals</a> identified as involved in paper mill activities.</p>

<p><strong>4. Unusual collaboration patterns</strong></p>

<p>One of the peculiarities of paper mill articles is its strange mix of authors. <a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/bjb/a/PDxQbGtKWvNw8Y9vdn78TrD/#">An article on the activity of ground beetles attacking crops in Kazakhstan</a>, for example, is written by authors who are neither affiliated with institutions in Kazakhstan nor experts in insects or agriculture. The authors’ backgrounds are suspiciously heterogeneous, ranging from anaesthesia, dentistry, to biomedical engineering.</p>

<p><strong>5. Anonymous co-authors</strong></p>

<p>Prospective customers of paper mill services usually have to agree to the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1574">rules of confidentiality</a>. By agreeing to this rule, buyers have no idea which journal their article will target or who their co-authors will be. Often, the authors listed on the same paper don’t even know each other.</p>

<h2>Spotting the red flags: how to detect paper mills articles</h2>

<p>Detecting scientific articles produced by paper mills often begins with analyzing retraction patterns carried out by journals. </p>

<p>This can be done in two ways: by tracking post-publication peer reviews on platforms like <a href="https://pubpeer.com/">PubPeer</a>, or by checking the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">Retraction Watch database</a>, a website that documents retractions of problematic scientific articles.</p>

<p>However, journals rarely state outright that a retraction is due to paper mill fraud. Instead, articles are typically pulled for reasons like <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1285126/full">improper inclusion of the name and order of authors</a>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08927022.2023.2267407">inclusion of many irrelevant citations or references</a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/275AA93D2422B4E8B30B74DA0310FE#4">plagiarism</a>, or <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/12/26/one-image-duplicated-eight-papers-yes-eight/">inclusion of manipulated or duplicated images</a>.</p>

<p>The proportion of scientific articles retracted for being associated with paper mills is much smaller than the estimated total number of paper mill articles currently in circulation. </p>

<p>Retraction Watch data, as of May 2024, <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx">only recorded</a> 7,275 retractions of articles related to the <em>paper mill</em> out of a total of 44,000 retractions recorded. In fact, it is estimated that up to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03464-x">400,000 <em>paper mill</em> articles</a> have infiltrated scientific literature over the past two decades. </p>

<p>Despite significant efforts from <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/paper-mills-see-the-wood-for-the-trees-part-3">publishers</a> and the academic community through organizations such as <a href="https://united2act.org/signatories/">United2Act</a>, a <a href="https://united2act.org/about/">global alliance</a> initiated by <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a> and <a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/">STM</a>, these attempts are barely enough.</p>

<h2>How paper mills hurt the public</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">UK Research Integrity Office</a>—an independent UK charity that offers support to the public, researchers and organisations to promote good academic research practice—estimates that the paper mill industry has gained around $10 million globally.  </p>

<p>For example, a Russian paper mill could earn <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/russian-website-peddles-authorships-linked-reputable-journals">$6.5 million</a> if they sold all the authorship of scientific articles it produced from 2019 to 2021. </p>

<p>In Indonesia, this financial loss directly impacts the public. Public universities rely on the state budget, funded largely by taxpayers, and tuition fees from students to cover operational expenses, including research grants and publication incentives. </p>

<p>Though the exact financial toll of these paper mills is hard to pin down, it is clear that the public <a href="https://theconversation.com/pelanggaran-akademis-di-indonesia-masih-marak-merusak-ekosistem-riset-dan-menyalahgunakan-uang-rakyat-224516">are footing the bill</a> for fraudulent research practices, siphoning resources away from enuin academic advancements.</p>
