    <h1>OS/2 Warp, PowerPC Edition</h1>

<p>After unexpectedly long development (but is that really
unexpected?), in December 1995 IBM finally &#34;shipped&#34; OS/2 Warp,
PowerPC edition. For convenience, from now on I will refer to the
product as OS/2 PPC. Following years of hype and high expectation, the
release was very low key and in fact marked the end of development of
OS/2 for PowerPC. The product was only available to limited number of
IBM customers and was never actively marketed. As far as I know, OS/2
PPC didn&#39;t even
have a box, although I do have the nice looking original CDs.</p>
<h4>The Hardware<br/>
</h4>
OS/2 PPC only supported extremely limited range of hardware -- IBM
Personal Power Series machines. Those were desktop models 830 and 850,
and OS/2 PPC probably also supported the Power Series ThinkPads 820 and
850, though I can only guess from the fact that the graphics chipset
employed by these ThinkPads is part of the very short list of supported
devices in OS/2 PPC.</div>
