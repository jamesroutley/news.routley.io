    <h1>At Recurse center! And, blogging again!</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>Blogging again. A lot has happened in four years.</p>
<p>One recent slice of it: I got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/how-shopify-bungled-its-latest-layoffs-and-made-employees-feel-like-npcs/">laid off from
Shopify</a>
in May 2023. It was an emotional gut-punch beyond what I could
have imagined. If you&#39;ve been through it, you know.</p>
<p>One of the best things I did to pick myself up (in parallel with a few weeks of
crying a lot, hiding at home with my girlfriend, and then going on a road trip with her to Myrtle Beach)
was when I thought &#34;Hey, maybe now that I
have time and severance pay, I could finally go to <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse!</a></p>
<p>Nervously, I applied, I was accepted to the Summer 2 23 batch, and here I am.</p>
<p>I&#39;m doing a 6-week batch and as of this writing am already in week 5. It&#39;s
going far too fast! This is the best thing I have
done as a programmer in years. I have met so many interesting people doing so
many cool things. Things I am doing so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying to finally wrap my head around functional programming</li>
<li>So far, this largely meant working through <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262560993/the-little-schemer/">The Little Schemer</a>, which I
    have never finished, despite it being one of my favorite programming books.
    <a href="https://slinkp.com/little-schemer-recursive-fun-20230710.html">Blog post about this here</a></li>
<li>Side quest: Fixing this blog!</li>
<li>Attacking my fear of writing user interfaces by writing a game (or actually,
  something more like an audio toy / chaotic &#34;instrument&#34;).</li>
<li>Deciding not to do &#34;impressive&#34; things that don&#39;t actually spark much innate
  excitement, as per the Recurse directive about <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives#volitional-muscles">Building your Volitional
  Muscles</a>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[G]rowing your ability to make decisions about your work and learning based on your own curiosity and joy, rather than external pressures and fears</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m still not sure I&#39;m going to pull off this game-thing.
It feels like a good example of <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives#work-at-the-edge">working at the edge of
my abilities</a>.
It&#39;s been very slow going and I&#39;m scared to try to hit my goals, which is a good sign.</p>
<h2>Side quest: fix the blog</h2>
<p>As for fixing this blog ... The blog toolchain was built some years ago on
<a href="https://getpelican.com">pelican</a>,
which worked fine for me at the time, but my installation was using ancient Python 2 and
old versions of everything. I couldn&#39;t even get that running on my current
personal laptop. Trying to install it on Python 3 led to a laundry list of errors
and warnings and it wouldn&#39;t get as far as generating actual content.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t want to throw away Pelican and start over, because that would probably
have meant a lot of hand-munging the content files to port them to something
new and maybe breaking my nav structure too. And I didn&#39;t want it to be a time
sink. I liked the low friction of the workflow... write markdown, preview by
running <code>make devserver</code>, push live by running <code>make rsync_upload</code>, that&#39;s it.</p>
<p>To make a long story short:</p>
<ul>
<li>I installed Pelican 4.8.0, using Python 3.</li>
<li>I removed as much of my config file as possible, eg turning off the theme and all plugins.</li>
<li>I threw away some problematic junk content that probably nobody but me ever
knew was there, and was drowning me in warnings.</li>
<li>I tried versions of the packages I needed until I found a set that ran
without error, and then froze those versions with <code>pip</code>.</li>
<li>I found out that the Bootstrap 3 theme I&#39;d been using was broken and
unmaintained on recent Pelican versions, so I ditched it and tried a bunch
until I landed on the new one (called <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/gum">Gum</a>).</li>
<li>Then I started gradually re-adding bits of my config.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s good enough to push live and start writing again!
Lots of old redirects are currently not working because my hand-made
<a href="https://github.com/slinkp/pelican-redirect">pelican-redirect</a> plugin still
isn&#39;t working with this setup, and I haven&#39;t had time to explore why.</p>
