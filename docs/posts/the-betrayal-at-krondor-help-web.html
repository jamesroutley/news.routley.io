This site was archived by <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/krondor_series/betrayal_at_krondor_help_web_1">Links</a> in 2011 before it disappeared from the web
when the author&#39;s university web server closed the account it was hosted on. As this site has been gone for years, and there is no way of contacting the 
original author for permission, it is being hosted here until such a day that the author can claim it or provide explicit permission for it being re-hosted.
Don&#39;t bother trying to e-mail the author via the links on these pages, as that e-mail address is long gone!</b></SPAN></td></tr>

The Webmaster thanks various contacts at SIERRA, who like this Website,
and do not object to any text or graphic contained herein.<p>
The Webmaster has also been contacted by various people who were instrumental
in creating the game, including the producer, the writer, and one of the main
programmers. They all like the BAK Help Web, and have no objections to the 
Webmaster&#39;s use of any material, textual or graphic, copied from the game and 
used in these pages.</p></b></SPAN></div>

applies to his manipulations of the game&#39;s graphics. If you intend to use the
contents of this Website for some other purpose than viewing them directly
via your browser, please observe the following:<p>

1. You are quite welcome to download any or all parts of the Website on to
your personal computer, for private use.</p><p>

2. You are more than welcome to place a link to the BAK Help Web on your own
Website, but only to the Front Page (krondor.html), not to any other pages in
the Web. The Webmaster would be glad to learn of any such links. If your Website is
BAK-related, contains material not already contained in the BAK Help Web, and
conforms to standards acceptable to the Webmaster, it will be included in the
LINKS page, if you wish.</p><p>

3. If you copy material from this Website, be it text, html-code or graphics, and
redistribute it in any manner without permission from the Webmaster, this will be
considered a copyright infringement. Should the Webmaster become aware of any such
infringement, a warning will be issued. If the warning is disregarded, a complaint
will be made to your provider.</p><p>
Please take this seriously. Only one such warning has been issued to date. It
was ignored, so the provider had to be contacted. The website in question was 
subsequently deleted by the provider. While the Webmaster does not like drastic 
measures, they are (unfortunately) necessary in such cases. Plagiarism is equivalent to Theft.</p></b></SPAN></div></p></div></div>
