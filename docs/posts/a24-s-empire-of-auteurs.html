    <h1>A24&#39;s Empire of Auteurs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Zoe Beyer, A24’s creative director, started out as the voice of its freewheeling social-media feeds. She now introduces its podcast, which borrows the format of <em>Interview</em> magazine: two artists, no intermediary. When she realized how intensely moviegoers felt about A24—acolytes were tattooing its logo on their bodies—she and a colleague proposed making branded merchandise. A test run of sweatshirts emblazoned with “<em>A TWENTY-FOUR</em>,” to clarify the pronunciation, sold out, confirming a hunger for more. Today, for a monthly fee, roughly a hundred thousand “AAA24 members” get first dibs on A24 products, free film tickets, and access to special events, which attendees inevitably post about online. The program is far from a profit center, but it generates highly effective advertising. An executive called the members “evangelicals for the movies.”</p><p>A24’s founding employees have largely stuck around, and partnerships with talent tend to be lasting, too: when the company backs a movie or a series—it also has a TV division—the implicit intent is to keep working with the creator. Executives are in constant conversation with their roster, and pride themselves on the intimacy of the operation. Decisions on new filmmakers are made democratically by a core group: Katz, Fenkel, Sacco, and Nicolette Aizenberg, the head of distribution. (Aizenberg is another veteran: in 2012, she and Sacco celebrated their first film festival together with tequila shots.) Katz, who has dark hair and narrow features, leads by asking questions; he responds to assessments he approves of with an emphatic “Correct!” Fenkel, taller and broader, is affably punctilious. He’s transparent in a business of bullshitters.</p><p>Discussions about green-lighting a project, Sacco told me, have “a creative component” and “an economic component.” When introducing prospects that his team is eager to cultivate, he offers the group a précis. The moment a deal is made, staffers in the marketing division read the script and begin strategizing. But the process of shaping and releasing a movie varies from director to director. “It’s personality-driven,” Sacco said. He considers it essential to get to know artists as individuals. (This goes beyond mere meetings—he recently attended a Charli XCX concert with Aster and Reijn.) Sacco explained, “If you spend time with these people and really understand why this feels important to them, then you understand the DNA of the movie better. If you understand the DNA of the movie better, you understand how to bring it into the world.”</p><p>In a landscape crowded by reboots and sequels, A24 executives pursue the unfamiliar. “Taste has to evolve with the times,” Sacco said. “We’re all collectively most interested in what is absent in culture—and what is absent is always changing.” He noted, “When ‘Spring Breakers’ came out, it felt new. In the wake of that movie, things with neon colors and that sort of attitude instantly felt a little borrowed, a little late.” In A24’s early years, it often picked up films that bigger companies had shied away from. Jonathan Glazer’s captivatingly hypnotic, half-improvised “Under the Skin,” which stars Scarlett Johansson as an alien who hunts lonely human men, had no other offers for a U.S. theatrical release; Garland’s wily “Ex Machina,” about an erratic tech billionaire who summons an employee to perform the Turing test on a beautiful android, had been dropped by its distributor. “We were ever so slightly ahead of the rest of the world in our perception of those movies,” Sacco said. Today, A24’s animating principle is “What else does the world not think should live on three thousand screens?”</p><p>Sacco had talked with me long enough that he was running late for a preview screening of Aster’s latest film, “Eddington,” at <em>MOMA</em>, ahead of its première, in Cannes, the following week. He invited me along for the ride. “I’m anxious to make our movies successful,” he continued, once we’d settled in a taxi. “If we fail in this thesis, something is reinforced that’s bad.” He’d been heartened by the recent triumph of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/05/05/ryan-coogler-profile">Ryan Coogler’s</a> “Sinners”—a Warner Bros. release, and the rare blockbuster with no basis in preëxisting I.P. “It’s great for anybody who’s doing anything original,” he said. By the same token, if A24’s big-budget swings go awry, there could be ramifications across Hollywood. Sacco mused, “If we’re another casualty in the struggle to make something quality mainstream, that would suck.”</p><p>Shortly before the première of “Eddington,” I arrived at the Palais des Festivals—a towering, half-glass structure with a red carpet flowing down an outside staircase—to find a crowd of young people holding signs, each with a variation on the same request: “<em>EDDINGTON Billet S.V.P.</em>” Liv, a twenty-four-year-old Berliner, had been drawn to “Eddington,” in part, by her love for A24. She first started paying attention to the company after watching “Midsommar”—another Aster film, though she seemed unaware of this fact. (One V.C. firm invested in the studio after finding that sixty per cent of people who go to A24 films do so <em>because</em> they’re A24 films; many know the brand better than the directors.) “I’ve never been disappointed with any A24 movie,” Liv told me. She said, of Gen Z’s particular affection for the studio, “Whenever something is kinda gory but aesthetically pleasing, everyone eats it up. We’re looking for weird movies. We feel seen.”</p><p>Anyone attending a gala première in Cannes, famous or not, must walk the red carpet. Civilians who overstay their welcome get hustled along by security. A24 executives, by contrast, speed through discreetly, declining to give interviews or pose for photos. (A representative <em>Variety</em> headline: “Secretive Founders Shun the Spotlight.”) Generally, the talent does the talking. The crowd that evening boasted several A24 alumni, including Harris Dickinson, Kidman’s youthful dom in “Babygirl.”</p><p>When “Eddington” started, the appearance of A24’s logo onscreen prompted a burst of applause. Reactions to the film, however, were sharply divided. The story is set in New Mexico in May, 2020, and plays on the real-life tensions stoked by the onset of <em>COVID</em>, the murder of George Floyd, and the rise of QAnon. The conflict between a conservative sheriff (Joaquin Phoenix) and a tech-friendly liberal mayor (Pedro Pascal) is inflamed by a mask mandate. Then come racial-justice protests, noxious conspiracy theories, and, in the final act, exploding bodies. When the lights went up, Aster addressed the audience with a nervous laugh: “Thank you so much for having me. I dunno—sorry?”</p><p>At the beachfront after-party, I found Sacco, dressed in a black suit and a black shirt. Seated behind Pascal at the première, he’d looked pleased and poised; now he was gnawing on a toothpick and worrying about reactions online. “I’m debating whether to go on Twitter,” he said.</p><p>A European buyer told me that he was impressed by the film. He’d been doing business with A24 since 2018, and felt that the studio had bridged a long-standing divide: “I’ve been coming to Cannes for many years, and there was a big difference between the super commercial and the art house. They weren’t really talking to each other. Now they do—there are big, artistic, commercial ventures. A24 really understood that. They were the first.”</p><p>In recent years, the indie distributor Neon, which has borrowed A24’s marketing tactics but focusses more on international titles, has become the dominant force at Cannes. By the festival’s end, it would pick up its sixth consecutive Palme d’Or—and its voluble C.E.O., Tom Quinn, would give half a dozen interviews. Still, A24’s festival parties have undeniable cachet. Though Aster initially looked trepidatious amid the red-tinged lighting and the potted palm trees, he was soon surrounded by admirers. Coralie Fargeat, the director of “The Substance”—the kind of stylized horror film that A24 made fashionable—hugged him. So did Reijn, who’d flown in to show support.</p><p>The party was stacked with stars—Austin Butler, who plays a cult leader in “Eddington,” huddled with Robert Pattinson—but Sacco slipped out early, citing a big day ahead. A24 had four movies at Cannes, a slate that neatly encapsulated its range. In addition to “Eddington,” there were two small-budget débuts, including “Pillion,” Harry Lighton’s funny, tender portrait of a shy gay man’s induction into B.D.S.M. Then, there was the studio’s first Spike Lee joint: “Highest 2 Lowest,” a riff on Akira Kurosawa’s classic crime drama “High and Low.” (Lee’s movie features a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it homage to the new partnership—a fateful apartment numbered A-24.) Premières aside, the company had deals to make: execs were meeting with prospective filmmakers and presenting international buyers with Benny Safdie’s “The Smashing Machine,” in which the Rock plays an M.M.A. fighter. By 1 <em>A</em>.<em>M</em>., the party was still going, but the champagne on A24’s table was untouched.</p><p>Conventional Hollywood wisdom dictates that the safest bet is a “four-quadrant” movie: one that attracts both men and women, and audiences both over and under twenty-five. Family-friendliness is ideal; inoffensiveness is essential. The major studios tend to develop projects internally—increasingly relying on decades-old I.P.—and then attach a director, reserving the right to order changes if the resulting picture tests poorly. When confronted with an original idea, executives’ first impulse is to make it more conventional. Celine Song recalls shopping around “Past Lives,” a quiet drama about an immigrant caught between her American husband and her Korean childhood sweetheart, and being asked if she could turn it into a romantic comedy in which everyone speaks English.</p><p>A24 made no such demands, in part because its business model doesn’t rely on mass appeal. “I talk to Sacco and Fenkel about this all the time—there is, in the film industry, a missing middle class,” Song told me. “There are either movies that have no expectation to make money, or there are movies that have nothing <em>but</em> expectations of making money.” Though A24’s box-office returns are often modest—the industry newsletter <em>The Ankler</em> observed that, in 2024, Warner Bros.’ “Beetlejuice” reboot had a bigger take than the entire year’s worth of A24 releases—the films have an outsized cultural impact. In June, the <em>Times</em> polled readers on the hundred best films of the twenty-first century; eleven were A24 titles.</p><p>“Moonlight” was No. 18. When its director, Barry Jenkins, met Sacco, in late 2014, A24 had yet to make a movie in-house. Producing films, rather than just acquiring them, would be a significant and difficult shift. Getting involved early in the process would allow A24 to give more creative input, and to avoid the frenzy of a bidding war—but fronting the cost, and betting on a filmmaker rather than on a finished product, entailed major financial risks. “Moonlight,” an affecting story about a Black boy growing up in Miami and coming to terms with his sexuality, had already been rejected by three financiers, despite a meagre budget of seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. But Sacco told Jenkins that the company had long hoped to start “building films from the ground up,” and had been searching for the right project. “Moonlight,” he said, was the one. Jenkins leapt: “Literally, it was, like, ‘Before they change their minds, let’s sign on the dotted line.’ ”</p></div></div></div></div></div>
