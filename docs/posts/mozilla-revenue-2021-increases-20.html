  <h2>Why I joined Mozilla</h2>

  

  <p>
    Carlos Torres joined the team in August as Chief Legal Officer. Carlos is
    responsible for leading the company’s global legal and public policy teams
    that develop the legal, regulatory and policy strategy to support the company’s
    mission to create a healthy internet. Carlos also serves as Corporate Secretary.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I was drawn to Mozilla because of its unique voice in technology,” Torres said.
    “There is no other organization that combines community, product, technology and
    advocacy to produce trusted innovative products that people love. I&#39;ve always
    admired Mozilla for its principled, people-focused approach.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Most recently, Carlos was general counsel of several venture-backed companies in
    the proptech, supply chain and crypto industries. Prior to that he spent over a
    decade at Salesforce in a variety of leadership roles. He also served as senior
    counsel of a biotech company and started his legal career at Orrick, Herrington
    &amp; Sutcliffe.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I&#39;ve been fortunate to have worked in a variety of companies and industries,
    including B2B SaaS, proptech, crypto, and biotech,” Torres said. “As Mozilla
    looks to the next 25 years this background will help me serve as a strategic
    business partner helping the company accelerate its growth and evolution. It&#39;s
    hard to predict what the Internet will look like and how people will use it in
    the future, but I do know that Mozilla will be at the forefront of ensuring
    the Internet remains a positive public resource applying a mission-driven and
    principled approach.”

  <h2>Why I Joined Mozilla</h2>

  <p>Leigh Felton – VP, Chief of Staff</p>

  <p>
    Leigh Felton joined the team in September as VP and Chief of Staff. In this
    role Leigh is responsible for the operational rhythm of the business, building
    continuity and strategic planning across teams, and partnering closely with each
    Steering Committee member.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I have been in the technology industry for over 20 years, with 15 of those
    concentrated in the Chief of Staff role,” Felton said. “This is a very nuanced
    position and can mean many things to different people and organizations. To me,
    the Chief of Staff position is about putting the company first, above politics and
    above individual goals. It is about helping leaders answer the question of ‘how do
    I step out of my defined line of business, to be a leader for the entire organization
    and deliver those results as part of the business I lead.’ The Chief of Staff role
    is to help drive consistency and predictability to chaos, and to help individuals
    feel they are really part of a community and their work and contributions
    significantly contribute to the success of that community.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Leigh is a seasoned leader, business strategist, and communications expert. Most
    recently, Leigh served as chief of staff for Microsoft’s Worldwide Public Sector
    (WWPS) organization, supporting public sector clients in their cloud adoption and
    digital transformation journey. She joined Microsoft’s Public Sector team from the
    Microsoft Office of Responsible AI. In this role she drove implementation of
    responsible AI across the company. This included companywide implementation strategy
    and planning for engineering and in-country teams and the Worldwide Responsible AI
    Champs program. Prior to her time at Microsoft, Leigh was appointed Assistant
    Director of the Business Services Division of Washington State, by then Governor
    Christine Gregoire.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Over the last few years, I have really concentrated my work and life on how technology
    can be a benefit to people and society,” Felton said. “My vision is exactly aligned to
    the reason I joined Mozilla. To make the internet available and accessible to all, to
    enable technology to benefit all communities across society, without creating significant
    discriminatory engines that perpetuate harm in already marginalized communities. Mozilla
    stands for so many things, but most of all, it is supporting a technological future that
    exists with a mindset of people first rather than revenue first. I am all on board for
    that and want to assist in that mission any way I can.”

  <h2>Mozilla Ventures Highlight: </h2>

  <p>
    SAIL has received funding from Mozilla Ventures, our impact venture fund.

  </p>

  <p>
    If you’ve ever dreamed of writing a graduate thesis that would spawn a multi-million dollar
    company to save countless lives, then you need to ask Anne Kim how she did it.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a perfect world, it would be easy to share and analyze critical data in healthcare.
    This would make collaboration and innovation across the medical sector swift and secure.
    It would mean that the best minds in the world would have quick access to the research they
    need to discover new ways to save and prolong life. “It would be beneficial to researchers
    and ultimately patients themselves,” Kim explains.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the world is not (yet) perfect. Often researchers are restricted to data gathered at
    specific hospitals, which leads to non-representative samples, and limited or biased insight.
    Worse, that data gets clogged up in months-long anonymization processes.
  </p>

  <p>
    “It’s difficult to balance the personal privacy of patients,” Kim elaborates. “If patients
    have a truly rare disease subtype or are from an underrepresented demographic, then they
    have potential risks for exposure and reidentification.”
  </p>

  <p>
    It makes sense—privacy absolutely cannot be compromised. So what can possibly be done?
  </p>

  <p>
    “There are many different ways people try to balance sharing data but also protecting data,”
    Kim explains, listing approaches like polymorphic encryption, anonymization, and synthetic
    data. But Kim uses a different approach. While studying bioinformatics at MIT with her
    professor, Sandy Pentland, Anne Kim invented a way to leverage Federated Learning and
    Blockchain solutions to enable the sharing of sensitive data without sacrificing patient’s
    privacy.
  </p>

  <p>
    By this method, researchers could learn what they needed from data collected from a real,
    diverse, global population, and never actually see the data themselves. The patient is
    respected, while the science is liberated. “Federated learning allows you to access data
    without ever having to move it or expose it in a raw form,” Kim explains.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, Kim and Pentland took her method and created Secure AI Labs (SAIL), a start-up
    on a mission to transform medical innovation.
  </p>

  <p>
    SAIL’s platform will revolutionize the discovery of life-changing drugs by uniting
    researchers around the world. Researchers used to have to wait for months for small amounts
    of data; now they can have instant access to anonymous data from all the hospitals on SAIL’s
    network.
  </p>

  <p>
    SAIL can also have a major impact on health equity. “By having data available, you are able
    to better represent and include different patients,” Kim explains. For example, clinical
    trial data can sometimes be overwhelmingly white and/or male, “and that doesn’t necessarily
    represent the whole patient population,” Kim says. In her graduate thesis, Kim wrote about a
    treatment for juvenile asthma — a treatment that was approved as a first-line therapy and
    deemed highly effective, despite being significantly <em>less</em> effective for African
    American and Puerto Rican children, as discovered in the post-market analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
    SAIL and federated learning can help address this, by federating minority data from across
    clinical trials to create “more statistical power and signal,” Kim notes.
  </p>

  <p>
    SAIL also has patient agency top of mind. “Generally we want to make patient data available
    for research,” Kim says. “But more specifically, we want to work with patients themselves and
    patient advocacy groups.” Kim wants patients to be “active participants” in the process,
    collectively negotiating the rights to their data for research usage.
  </p>

  <p>
    SAIL is everything Mozilla is looking for in a Mozilla Venture’s project. Its innovative
    approach to disrupting a hugely important field is breathtaking, while the company itself
    embodies the values we hold nearest to our hearts: privacy, transparency, and collaboration.

  <h2>Mozilla Fellows Highlight: </h2>

  <p>Crystal Lee – Senior Fellow, Responsible Computer Science</p>

  <p>
    “I have always thought of Mozilla as an organization that takes a critical approach to
    building a better internet,” says Crystal Lee, a Senior Fellow in Mozilla’s Responsible
    Computer Science Challenge, which brings interdisciplinary, critical perspectives to
    technology in undergraduate computer science curricula. “The research that Mozilla
    produces — alongside its privacy conscious products — represent the best in the business
    in a world that often fetishizes tech as an unqualified good. I’m really proud to be part
    of an organization that thinks really carefully about technology as a fundamentally
    sociotechnical system.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Lee is also an incoming Assistant Professor in Computational Media and Design at MIT where
    she works on topics related to the social and political dimensions of computing, data
    visualization, and disability. Lee says, “I spent a great deal of time during my PhD at
    MIT thinking about how to change tech culture within the context of teaching, and my
    Mozilla projects have helped me sharpen those ideas while thinking about other connections
    to industry and civil society.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “It can sometimes be difficult to imagine a positive future of the internet when we’re mired
    in so much systemic inequality,” says Lee, “but I’m hopeful that there can be a place where
    people can meaningfully connect with one another with safeguards against abuse and exploitation.”

  <h2>Mozilla Ventures Highlight: </h2>

  <p>
    Block Party has received funding from Mozilla Ventures, our impact venture fund. Learn more about
    Mozilla Ventures <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/mozilla/mozilla-ventures-investing-in-responsible-tech/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener" title="This link opens in a new tab">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Imagine being a regular target for misogynistic and racist abuse, and sincerely saying, “The one
    place that actually felt safe was Twitter.” That’s what Tracy Chou said after she invented
    <a href="https://www.blockpartyapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener" title="This link opens in a new tab">Block Party</a>, an app designed to
    automatically protect Twitter users from online harassment.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a woman software engineer and an outspoken diversity advocate, Chou was a frequent target of
    online attacks. Sometimes these attacks went from offline to the real world, such as the time a troll
    followed her all the way from London to San Francisco to harass her. Meanwhile, Chou — and other
    victims of online harassment — also have to contend with major misconceptions about the phenomenon.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Often those who don’t experience online harassment trivialize the harms as ‘not real’ because they’re
    ‘only’ online. They assume that it’s straightforward for people to just sign off and ignore the trolls,”
    Chou explains. “But vicious and vile comments take a real psychological toll, especially at volume, and
    being online isn’t optional for many of us, it’s an integral part of our professional and social lives.
    Harassment today forces many to make difficult tradeoffs between our mental health and ability to
    participate in digital spaces.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Chou understood that social media sites could be doing more to protect her and other victims of
    coordinated and ceaseless online harassment — victims who are frequently women of color and members of
    marginalized communities. Social media companies could, for example, automatically mute accounts that
    displayed bot-like behavior. Yet Chou also understood that social media companies are structured to put
    their bottom line first, and their user protections second. So, she built her own protections. Block
    Party is an app that Chou deems “<a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-future-of-platform-power-making-middleware-work/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener" title="This link opens in a new tab">Middleware</a>,”
    a third-party piece of software that improves upon a social media site’s user experience in ways the
    platform can’t — or won’t.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Block Party’s focus is on the end user and their experience of safety and control online,” Chou explains.
    “Although platforms have their role to play in ensuring safety, their business incentives of growth and
    engagement mean their product priorities lie elsewhere. Structurally, there are things we can do as a
    third party — more customization, more power tools, cross-platform support — that would never make sense
    within platforms.”
  </p>

  <p>
    With Block Party, accounts that are likely to be trolls won’t even appear in your mentions. You know these
    accounts: very few followers, names with certain keywords, often just eggs for profile photos.
  </p>

  <p>
    Block Party doesn’t delete their tweets; instead, it hides them from the user. They’re not deleted because
    they may be needed to show the police — something Chou has had to do — and in the past, that meant needing
    to re-sift through the abusive messages. Block Party can also automatically block accounts that have liked
    or retweeted other offending tweets. All in all, it makes everyday life online much more manageable for
    anyone frequently targeted by harassment campaigns.
  </p>

  <p>
    The need for these protections has never been greater, as evidenced by Block Party’s meteoric start. It’s
    already raised $4.8 million in seed money, and in 2022 Chou landed on Time’s &#34;<a href="https://time.com/collection/women-of-the-year/6150549/tracy-chou/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener" title="This link opens in a new tab">Women of the Year</a>&#34; list.
  </p>

  <p>
    “What stays with me are the stories of the people we&#39;ve helped: activists and journalists and people from
    marginalized communities who feel safer on Twitter after using Block Party,” Chou notes. “Around 1 in every
    10 Block Party users have tweeted about it, sharing the ways the product has given them more control and
    helped them protect their mental health despite an onslaught of vitriol. That&#39;s why we do what we do, and
    I&#39;m so grateful to get to play a role in keeping them safe.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Mozilla couldn’t be more proud to be working with pioneers like Block Party. When security and privacy are
    not taken seriously by the platforms, it takes people like Chou stepping in to do the work. Currently, Block
    Party functions only on Twitter, but Chou plans to bring the same protection to Instagram and other platforms.
    We are honored to help her get there.

  <h2>Why I Joined Mozilla</h2>

  <p>Brandon Borrman – VP of Global Communications</p>

  <p>
    For more than 20 years, Mozilla’s VP of Global Communications Brandon Borrman has helped
    some of the world&#39;s most recognized organizations use communications to advance their
    business, policy, and social goals. Borrman has built and run communications teams for
    companies including Twitter, Ancestry, United Airlines, and Starbucks, and has consulted
    for dozens more, including Dropbox, Airbnb, Facebook, Ford, and Cisco.
  </p>

  <p>
    On his position as Mozilla’s VP of Global Communications, Borrman says, “As the head of
    Mozilla&#39;s global communications team, my job is to help Mozilla present itself to the
    outside world and engage with like minded communities who want to ensure an open internet
    for every citizen going forward. I bring 20+ years of experience, having helped numerous
    global organizations use strategic communications to drive change and reshape industries.”
  </p>

  <p>
    On Mozilla and the future of the internet, Borrman says, “I care deeply about the internet
    and protecting it as an open, free utility for people around the world. The last 10 years
    have obviously shown how fragile that vision of the internet is as a handful of companies
    have consolidated their power and influence of the internet at large. Mozilla is uniquely
    able to push against this trend and to fight for the users of the internet. That ability
    grows from its mission and principles, and is made truly powerful through its history of
    turning policy theory into product reality. There&#39;s no better organization to work at
    today if you care about the future of the internet.”

  <h2>Why I Joined Mozilla</h2>

  <p>KeyAnna Schmiedl – VP of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Sustainability (DEIS)</p>

  <p>
    KeyAnna Schmiedl joined the team in September as VP of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and
    Sustainability (DEIS). In this new role, KeyAnna oversees Mozilla’s DEIS strategy,
    initiatives, and goals.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Mozilla is about being a guide to a safe and joyful internet. The principles for how to
    best go about that hold the tenets of diversity, equity, inclusion, access, and
    sustainability at their core,” Schmiedl says on her decision to join Mozilla. “The spirit
    of how the organization has come to be informs every aspect of its decision-making and
    prioritizing, and the fact that inherent to those priorities are principles of diversity,
    equity, access, inclusion, and sustainability is truly remarkable, unfortunately rare,
    and exceedingly critical for our time.”
  </p>

  <p>
    KeyAnna has extensive experience developing global strategies that interlace inclusivity
    across organizations from organizational design, competency modeling, safety and wellness,
    talent acquisition, and learning and development. Most recently, Schmiedl was global head
    of Culture &amp; Inclusion at Wayfair; previously, she worked with top organizations such as
    Harvard University, Santander Bank, and IBISConsulting. KeyAnna received the industry’s
    esteemed Diversity Leader Award granted by the Diversity Journal due to her stand-out work
    in creating an open, equitable, and inclusive workplace culture which also saw her featured
    on the Boston Business Journal and Fortune’s 40 Under 40 list and was named a DEI Trailblazer
    by Business Insider in 2021.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across her body of work she has seen the role the internet plays in shaping conversations
    around diversity. “Over the last several years we&#39;ve seen more communities that were historically
    &#34;othered&#34; come together through connections on the internet to demand that spaces be safer for
    them to experience joy, reap the financial and social rewards of their savvy and creativity,
    and acknowledge their contributions,” Schmiedl said. “We&#39;ve seen what happens when people
    harness the power of the internet to shine a light on local challenges and convert that energy
    to global movements for change.”

  <h2>Why I Joined Mozilla</h2>

  <p>Mohamed Nanabhay leads Mozilla Ventures</p>

  <p>
    He has spent his career in technology, media, and investing where a key theme has been building
    bridges, connecting people, and amplifying voices.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Al Jazeera he was deeply focused on using social technologies to not only distribute news but
    also discover and amplify the voices of people being most impacted by power. With Creative Commons
    he worked to launch a repository of broadcast quality video footage under the most permissive license.
    At Global Voices, bridge building and providing a nuanced understanding through a local lens was key
    to what they did. And at the Media Development Investment Fund (MDIF), where he served on the board
    before becoming Deputy CEO, they were deeply committed to investing in independent media around the
    world providing the news, information and debate that people need to build free, thriving societies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to his work with Mozilla Ventures, Nanabhay spent time serving on Mozilla’s board of directors.
    His work with Mozilla ties into his passion for thinking about how we better use technology in a
    meaningful way. “Mozilla is this unique place where everyone uses different tools to work toward the

    think about adding a new tool, venture capital, was an exciting opportunity. It will allow us to go
    out and find others who are values aligned and scale our work and impact.”

  <h2>Why I Joined Mozilla</h2>

  <p>Zhilun Pang – Director, Finance and Admin</p>

  <p>
    Meet Zhilun Pang, Mozilla Foundation’s Director of Finance &amp; Administration. Zhilun, who goes by “Z,”
    came to Mozilla Foundation with 17 years of experience in finance and operations. Z started his career
    in the investment industry, spending 14 years in business management, strategy, and risk management
    roles in the global asset and wealth management divisions at J.P. Morgan.
  </p>

  <p>
    These days, serving a good cause is what motivates Z the most. The Brooklyn-native last worked as the
    Director of Finance for a community-based non-profit in NYC and two other non-profits (a social
    enterprise incubator and an anti-hunger advocacy organization) prior. Z took a three-year career
    break to raise his daughter, which gave him time to think about pursuing his values and “what I want
    to be when I grow up again.” This led him to mission-driven work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here at Mozilla Foundation, Z hopes to enhance our financial tools to help the organization gain better
    insight and make more data-informed decisions on how Mozilla uses its money. “Being a fiduciary is
    something I deeply value and was ingrained in me during much of my career at J.P. Morgan. I want to
    do my best to safeguard the Foundation’s assets so that we can continue to build on our work,” says Z.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, it’s about the mission. “I think about how important the internet is now and how important
    the internet will be for my daughter. I’m here to do what I can to help Mozilla build a healthier one.”
