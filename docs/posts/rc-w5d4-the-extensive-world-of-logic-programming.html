      <div><p>Events at RC usually start a few minutes past the hour, and it’s always more fun to spend the time in between with ice breaker questions. This week we had “What’s your favorite programming language mascot?”. I was going to go for Rust’s Ferris, but given this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computing_mascots">list</a>, my vote has to go to the wonderfully-apt Docker whale (which I learned is called Moby Dock).</p><p>The topic for the functional programming study group this week was logic programming. We started with a quick demo of Prolog. The idea of declarative programming - tell the program what you want, rather than what to do - impressed our group; it certainly <a href="https://twitter.com/joeerl/status/1008701954317570049">impressed</a> Joe Armstrong.</p><p>What I was impressed by was the extensive uses of Datalog. Datalog is a subset of Prolog, and since Alain Colmerauer created Prolog to solve problems in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220629012248/http://www.let.rug.nl/bos/lpn/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&amp;pageid=lpn-htmlse28" title="Link: https://web.archive.org/web/20220629012248/http://www.let.rug.nl/bos/lpn/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&amp;pageid=lpn-htmlse28">computational linguistics</a>, it’s less of a surprise it’s extends nicely to <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/notes/Languages/datalog/#adts">ADTs</a>. Recursive rules are easy to do, ditto <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/notes/Languages/datalog/#graph-algorithms">graph algorithms</a>. <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/notes/Languages/datalog/#program-analysis" title="Link: https://www.philipzucker.com/notes/Languages/datalog/#program-analysis">Program analysis</a> involves reducing programs to a graph-like form so we also get this for free. Now there’s <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/notes/Languages/datalog/#theorem-proving">theorem-proving</a>, <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/notes/Languages/datalog/#incremental--differential-datalog" title="Link: https://www.philipzucker.com/notes/Languages/datalog/#incremental--differential-datalog">incremental computing</a> and <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/notes/Languages/datalog/#crdts" title="Link: https://www.philipzucker.com/notes/Languages/datalog/#crdts">CRDTs</a>. If you haven’t noticed the pattern, all the links point to the excellent <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/notes/Languages/datalog/">resource</a> by Philip Zucker.</p><p>This <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow">excerpt</a> on Frank McSherry&#39;s differential dataflow is a sign post for future reading. In particular, he <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2016-06-21.md">notes</a> how Datalog programs map very nicely onto these primitives.</p><blockquote><p>Differential dataflow is a data-parallel programming framework designed to efficiently process large volumes of data and to quickly respond to arbitrary changes in input collections.</p></blockquote><p>Thematically-related is <a href="https://flix.dev/">Flix</a>, a general-purpose programming language which is distinctive for its first-class Datalog support.</p><p>My take away from the week is, having spent a lot of time writing SQL, it would be nice to try out Datalog as a query language. Writing recursive queries is a lot more ergonomic in Datalog. What I also learned was SQL is closer to natural language <a href="https://logica.dev">by design</a>, which perhaps explains hard-to-read SQL queries that correspond to simple logic programs.</p></div>
