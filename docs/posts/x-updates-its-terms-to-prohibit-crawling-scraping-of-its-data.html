    <h1>X updates its Terms to prohibit crawling/scraping of its data</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
							
<p>We just covered an update to X&#39;s terms of service a week ago about <a href="https://stackdiary.com/x-can-now-use-posts-for-ai-training-as-per-terms-of-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X letting itself use Posts</a> (public data) for training its AI models. Today, a new update has entered <a href="https://twitter.com/en/tos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official policy</a>, which outlines that X doesn&#39;t want anyone scraping or crawling its data unless there is mutual consent.</p>



<p>Under the <em>Misuse of the Services</em> clause, it now says,</p>



<p>NOTE: crawling or scraping the Services in any form, for any purpose without our prior written consent is expressly prohibited</p>



<p>The <em>mutual consent</em> part I am talking about is in relation to Google, which, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/07/03/twitter-google-search/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for a brief moment back in June</a>, was unable to show Posts/Profiles because X took the drastic measure of blocking any kind of unauthenticated access to the site. This limitation was eventually lifted, with a caveat:</p>



<ul>
<li>You cannot see the entire Posts thread. You can only see the original Post.</li>
</ul>



<p>It also appears that X has updated its <a href="https://twitter.com/robots.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">robots.txt</a> file:</p>



<pre><code># Every bot that might possibly read and respect this file
# ========================================================
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
</code></pre>



<p>This blocks every single Bot and search engine that there is, as long as they respect robots.txt. Thankfully, you can use a service like the <a href="https://stackdiary.com/brave-selling-copyrighted-data-for-ai-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brave Search API</a> to circumvent this problem, as they don&#39;t care about copyright and don&#39;t have a User-Agent to block. </p>



<p><em>Thank god!</em></p>



<p>It&#39;ll be interesting to see if Elon (X) monitors this closely and actually ends up taking someone to court if they find a third party has used Posts (or any other X &#34;Services&#34; data) for training AI models that aren&#39;t part of the X family.</p>
