    <h1>5G Skeptic</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">When I was working at AWS, around 2017 we started getting excited pitches from companies who wanted to be part of the 5G build-out, saying
    that obviously there’d be lots of opportunities for public-cloud providers. But I never walked away convinced. Either I didn’t
    believe the supposed customers really needed what 5G offered, or I didn’t believe the opportunity was anywhere near big enough
    to justify the trillion-dollar build-out investment. Six years later, I still don’t.  This is a report on a little online survey
    I ran, looking
    for actual real-world 5G impact to see if I was wrong.</p>

<p><i>[Note: When I say “G” or “M” I’m talking about Gbits or Mbits/second.]</i></p>

<p id="p-1"><span>Why 5G?</span> · 
Here’s why the 5G vendors say we need their product:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Faster connections<span> —</span> there is talk of 10G!</p>
</li>
<li><p>More bandwidth, so you can provide data in crowded places like sports stadiums.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lower latency, because you can put servers in base stations, which in particular could be useful for self-driven
      vehicles. AWS offers infrastructure: see
      <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/">AWS Wavelength</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p-3"><span>Why not?</span> · 
Disclosure: I’m affected by my personal experience. My home office is on our boat, anchored in central Vancouver. I pay my
    mobile provider more for extra data and do all my work via a hotspot on my aging Pixel 4. The phone calls
    what it sees “LTE+” (I don’t claim to understand what that means) which de facto gives me lots of tens of Mbits/sec, plenty
    enough for heavy Internet geeking with streamed background music, and watching ball games (remember, I’m semi-retired).
    Interestingly, the Marina also provides a WiFi signal which is pathetically slow and unreliable compared to the 4G data; the
    notion that WiFi is the gold standard for wireless Internet is pretty well over.</p>

<p>Our family has a cabin an hour’s boat-ride from Vancouver on the shores of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howe_Sound">Howe Sound</a>.  We have
    <a href="https://www.telus.com/en/internet/smart-hub">“Smart Hub Rural Internet”</a>, which delivers a solid 15-25M down and
    10+ up. Plenty enough for four people.</p>

<p>So, I’m having trouble seeing what problem I have that 5G will solve.</p>

<p id="p-4"><span>Speed?</span> · 
Granteed: Like many people, at home we have “fiber” Internet which offers hundreds of M so that our family of four can all
    stream and game at the same time, no problem.</p>

<p>Question: How often do you need more than the 50M or so LTE offers in a situation where it’s cheaper to provide it with 5G
    than with a wired connection?</p>

<p id="p-5"><span>Bandwidth</span> · 
This is one that I can sort of believe in. In a football stadium or a big conference keynote, it is possible to provide
    decent WiFi coverage (I’ve experienced it). Is 5G a cheaper or better way to do that?  I don’t know, but it doesn’t sound
    crazy.</p>

<p id="p-6"><span>Latency</span> · 
Obviously, this would be a big deal for online PvP gaming, although
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GGPO">rollback netcode</a> is producing remarkably good results these days.  And then
    there’s the autonomous-vehicle space. So, once
    again, doesn’t sound crazy.</p>

<p>The gaming angle sounds more plausible than self-driving, which (I think) would need reliable 5G along the whole
    route<span> —</span> nobody wants a self-driving feature that randomly cuts in and out as you zip down the
    road.</p>

<p>The whole low-latency thing is based on co-locating compute in the (many,
    many) 5G base stations.   Note the reference to AWS Wavelength above; having a public-cloud provider run the
    compute makes all sorts of sense to me. But still, I do wonder about the economics; all that compute is going to add up.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>The real question</span> · 
5G started rolling out in the spring of 2019, so it’s had three years to make a difference. I don’t personally know anyone
    whose life has been changed by 5G. Yes, family members with newer phones occasionally report that the status bar says “5G”, but
    I don’t hear that they’re having a different experience.</p>

<p>But I don’t know <em>that</em> many people. So I asked the Internet.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/03/26/-big/question.jpg.html"><img alt="Asking Twitter about 5G" title="Asking Twitter about 5G" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/03/26/question.png"/></a></p>
<p>Last time I checked that tweet  had around 44,000 impressions, people who had a chance to pipe up and relate
    their personal or professional experience of 5G.  Lots did, so I’ll use a few of the more clueful responses to support
    this narrative.</p>

<p>Also, note that my readership includes a whole lot of professional software developers. So, let’s see what they say
    about new kinds of applications and services that 5G has brought to the table.</p>

<p id="p-13"><span>Theme: 5G vs wired</span> · 
Does it make sense to replace your existing wired Internet with 5G?  As always, the answer is “it depends” but one common
    theme emerges: If your wired connection is lousy, 5G might be a win.</p>

<p>Or maybe 5G is just better?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/03/26/-big/better-than-fiber.jpg.html"><img alt="On/Off on 5G" title="On/Off on 5G" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/03/26/better-than-fiber.png"/></a></p>
<p>Others disagree, but point out that fiber may not be an option.</p>

<p>I wonder about the economics of deploying 5G vs fiber. It’s worth considering that 5G replaces the last mile and reduces the
    on-prem installation work to zero.</p>

Some report generally better coverage on 5G. Seems a little strange given the early stage of the build-out, but here they
    are.</p>

<p>I’m dubious too, probably because I live (and wrote this essay, including gathering and editing all the screenshots) on a 4G hotspot.</p>

<p id="p-10"><span>Theme: Rural coverage</span> · 
As a special case, I got multiple reports of better rural coverage. Which, once again, is
    surprising<span> —</span> I thought 5G’s sweet spot was short-range applications.</p>

<p id="p-17"><span>Now the developers</span> · 
My online following isn’t huge, but it contains quite a few senior software developers, people who build high-impact
    applications and services for Big Tech corporations and who work on foundational open-source projects.  So, let’s hear about
    what they’re building that’s enabled by 5G technology.</p>

<p>Exactly one such developer weighed in on the subject.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/03/26/-big/atsss.jpg.html"><img alt="5G ATSSS" title="5G ATSSS" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/03/26/atsss.png"/></a></p>
<p>I had to go look up what “ATSSS” is.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_data_offloading#ATSSS">Here you go</a>: “3GPP has started to standardize the
    Access Traffic Steering, Switching &amp; Splitting (ATSSS) function to enable 5G devices to use different types of access networks,
    including Wi-Fi. The ATSSS service leverages the Multipath TCP protocol to enable 5G devices to simultaneously utilize different
    access networks.”</p>

<p>Doesn’t sound terrible. Life-changing? Your call. Um, any other developers out there working on things that will move the needle?</p>

<p id="p-19"><span>Then there’s this</span> · 
John Gruber
    <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/23/5g-battery-life">links to and expands</a> on a <cite>WSJ</cite> report on
    how 5G burns your mobile’s battery faster than LTE, and offers advice for how to disable it, because:
    <i>There is nothing I do with my iPhone — nothing — where I find LTE even just a little bit “too slow”.</i></p>

<p>Me too.</p>

<p id="p-18"><span>What I think</span> · 
Well, they built 4G and it worked pretty well. So they had to build 5G, didn’t they?  It’s perfectly possible that, ten years
    from now, we’ll look in the rear-view and say “That was a good investment.”  I wouldn’t bet on it, but it’s possible.</p>
