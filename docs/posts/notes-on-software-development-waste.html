<tr>
<td>Definition</td>
<td>The cost of building a feature or product that does not address user or business needs.</td>
<td>The cost of duplicating work, expediting lower value user features, or delaying necessary bug fixes.</td>
<td>The cost of altering delivered work that should have been done correctly but was not.</td>
<td>The cost of creating a more complicated solution than necessary, a missed opportunity to simplify features, user interface, or code.</td>
<td>The costs of unneeded expenditure of mental energy.</td>
<td>The costs of burdening the team with unhelpful stress.</td>
<td>The cost of idle time, often hidden by multi-tasking.</td>
<td>The cost of re-acquiring information that the team once knew.</td>
<td>The cost of incomplete, incorrect, misleading, inefficient, or absent communication.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Causes</td>
<td>1. User desiderata (not doing user research, validation, or testing; ignoring user feedback; working on low user value)</td>
<td>1. Backlog inversion</td>
<td>1. Technical debt</td>
<td>1. Unnecessary feature complexity from the user’s perspective</td>
<td>1. Suffering from technical debt</td>
<td>1. Low team morale</td>
<td>1. Slow tests or unreliable tests</td>
<td>1. Team churn</td>
<td>1. Team size is too large</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> </td>
<td>2. Business desiderata (not involving a business stakeholder; slow stakeholder feedback; unclear product priorities)</td>
<td>2. Working on too many features simultaneously</td>
<td>2. Rejected stories (e.g. product manager rejects story implementation)</td>
<td>2. Unnecessary technical complexity (duplicating code, lack of interaction design reuse, overly complex technical design created up-front)</td>
<td>2. Complex or large stories</td>
<td>2. Rush mode</td>
<td>2. Unreliable acceptance environment</td>
<td>2. Knowledge silos</td>
<td>2. Asynchronous communication (distributed teams; distributed stakeholders; dependency on another team; opaque processes outside team)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> </td>
<td> </td>
<td>3. Duplicated work</td>
<td>3. No clear definition of done (ambiguous stories; second guessing design mocks)</td>
<td> </td>
<td>3. Inefficient tools and problematic APIs, libraries, and frameworks</td>
<td>3. Interpersonal or team conflict</td>
<td>3. Missing information, people, or equipment</td>
<td> </td>
<td>3. Imbalance (dominating the conversation; not listening)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> </td>
<td> </td>
<td>4. Not enough ready stories</td>
<td>4. Defects (poor testing strategy; no root-cause analysis on bugs)</td>
<td> </td>
<td>4. Unnecessary context switching</td>
<td> </td>
<td>4. Context switching from delayed feedback</td>
<td> </td>
<td>4. Inefficient meetings (lack of focus; skipping retros; not discussing blockers each day; meetings running over (e.g. long stand-ups)</td>
