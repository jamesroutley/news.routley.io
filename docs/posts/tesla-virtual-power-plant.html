<h2>Benefits of Participation</h2>

<ul><li><strong>Stabilize California’s Grid</strong>: The extra capacity your Powerwall provides could help avoid or reduce blackouts in a severe emergency. This way, Powerwall can keep the lights on for both you and your community.</li>
	<li><strong>Clean the Grid</strong>: Tesla will dispatch your Powerwall when the grid is in critical need of additional power. That is when the least efficient generators would typically come online.</li>
	<li><strong>Unite as a Tesla Community</strong>: Team up with other Powerwall owners who are accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy and help form the largest distributed battery in the world – potentially over 50,000 Powerwalls. As part of the VPP, your Powerwall will have an outsized positive impact on the grid over traditional demand response programs.</li>
	<li><strong>Maintain Your Energy Security</strong>: Powerwall will discharge during VPP events but won’t discharge below your Backup Reserve. Adjust your Backup Reserve to control your contribution while maintaining backup energy for outages.</li>
	<li><strong>Earn Compensation</strong>: Through the ELRP pilot, you will receive $2 for every additional kWh your Powerwall provides during an event. You don’t have to change your energy usage behavior to participate.</li>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Tesla and PG&amp;E will call upon the Virtual Power Plant when the California grid operator, CAISO, declares an alert, warning or emergency in response to challenging grid conditions. Tesla and PG&amp;E may also call events at other times to meet the program minimum of 20 hours of events. These additional events may include responses to CAISO Flex Alerts.</p>

<h3>What to Expect</h3>

<h4>Before the Event</h4>

<p>When an event is scheduled, you will receive a push notification informing you of event times. You can expect your Powerwall system to prioritize charging and preparing for an event after the event is scheduled. An event may be scheduled a day ahead, but circumstances may require much less notice.</p>

<h4>During the Event</h4>

<p>When the event begins, you will receive a push notification reminding you of the event end time, and your Powerwall will begin discharging to support the grid. Your Powerwall will discharge until the event ends, or when it discharges to your selected Backup Reserve level. Powerwall will export a safe amount of power, which may be similar to onsite solar export. This may not be the full power capacity of your Powerwall.</p>

<h4>After the Event</h4>

<p>At completion of the event, Powerwall will resume normal operation.</p>



<h3><a name="controlling-participation" id="controlling-participation">Controlling Your Participation</a></h3>

<p><a name="controlling-participation" id="controlling-participation">Powerwall gives you three options for controlling your participation in VPP events:</a></p>

<h4><a name="controlling-participation" id="controlling-participation">Set your Backup Reserve</a></h4>

<p><a name="controlling-participation" id="controlling-participation">Powerwall will not dispatch to an energy level below your Backup Reserve. Setting your Backup Reserve is the best way to control how much energy you elect for participation and how much you maintain in case of an outage.</a></p>

<h4><a name="controlling-participation" id="controlling-participation">Opt-out of a Single Event</a></h4>

<p><a name="controlling-participation" id="controlling-participation">When an event is scheduled or active, Powerwall gives you the option to opt-out of the event through the Tesla app. When you opt-out, Powerwall will stop reacting to the event, and resume normal operation.</a></p>

<h4><a name="controlling-participation" id="controlling-participation">Suspend Participation</a></h4>

<p><a name="controlling-participation" id="controlling-participation">You have a VPP participation toggle in the ‘Settings’ menu of the Tesla app. If you turn this off, your Powerwall system will not react to events when they are scheduled, and you will not be notified of the events. You are still enrolled in the program, however, and can resume your participation at any time by toggling your participation back on.</a></p>

<h2>Unenrollment</h2>

<p>Unenrolling from the program takes away your opportunity to earn money supporting the grid and is not necessary to stop unwanted use of your Powerwall. The <a data-icon-name="null" data-tesla-link-styles="" href="#controlling-participation" link_icon_name="null" link_styles="[object Object]" data-tesla_locale_processed="1">Controlling Your Participation</a> section above can help you achieve a level of participation that works for you.</p>

<p>Should you want to unenroll from the program, contact PG&amp;E or <a data-icon-name="null" data-tesla-link-styles="" href="https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/more/additional-support/contact-us" link_icon_name="null" link_styles="[object Object]" data-tesla_locale_processed="1">Tesla Customer Support</a>.</p>

<h2>Compensation</h2>

<p>The Tesla and PG&amp;E ELRP pilot will compensate you $2 for every additional kWh that your Powerwall delivers during an event beyond typical behavior.</p>

<p>Your compensation depends on:</p>

<ul><li>The participating energy capacity of your system, which depends on the number of Powerwalls and your Backup Reserve. Lower your Backup Reserve to earn more.</li>
	<li>How fully charged your Powerwall is for the event. There may not be enough solar energy or time to fully charge the Powerwall before an event.</li>
	<li>How much your Powerwall would typically charge or discharge during the event time.</li>
	<li>Whether the Powerwall can export all available energy during the event. Powerwall may not have time to safely discharge all participating energy during the event. Powerwall may need to limit exports to safe levels, typically similar to solar export levels.</li>
</ul>

<section data-gtm-key="tesla-rich-text-46421" id="tesla-rich-text-46421">
    <h4>Example One:</h4>

<p>A one-Powerwall system with a Backup Reserve of 20% that is fully charged at the start of an event has 13.5 kWh * (100%-20%) = 10.8 kWh to contribute during that event.</p>

<p>If this system would typically serve 3 kWh of energy during the event hours, fully dispatching the Powerwall down to the Backup Reserve would deliver 7.8 kWh of additional kWh.</p>

<p>At $2 per kWh, this could be worth $15.60 for this event.</p>

<h4>Example Two:</h4>

<p>A two-Powerwall system with a Backup Reserve of 40% that is fully charged at the start of an event has 2*13.5 kWh * (100%-40%) = 16.2 kWh to contribute during that event.</p>

<p>If this system would typically serve 5 kWh of load during the event hours, fully dispatching the Powerwalls down to the Backup Reserve would deliver 11.2 kWh of additional kWh.</p>

<p>At $2 per kWh, this could be worth $22.40 for this event.</p>

<h2>Payment</h2>

<p>At the end of the season, which is typically towards the end of the year, PG&amp;E will calculate your contribution and incentive payment from your Powerwall data. Your payment will come from Tesla and you can expect payment before the end of March 2023.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>



<h3>What information is needed to successfully enroll?</h3>

<p>Many customers will be asked to provide some information so that PG&amp;E can identify the right utility account and determine eligibility.</p>

<p>Where we have information, we will pre-populate the forms, but it is important that the information you provide is the same as the information in your PG&amp;E account.</p>

<p>If you don’t know the right information, the best place to check is your PG&amp;E bill. See the below example to locate information quickly on your bill:</p>

<ol><li>Account number</li>
	<li>Meter number</li>
</ol>

<section data-gtm-key="tesla-rich-text-46477" id="tesla-rich-text-46477">
    <h3>How do I ensure that I will have enough energy for backup power?</h3>

<p>A push notification will inform you that there will be an ELRP event. You can adjust your Backup Reserve level then or at any time, based on your own risk of outage.</p>

<p>If <a data-icon-name="null" data-tesla-link-styles="" href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/published/News_release/7066.htm" link_icon_name="null" link_styles="[object Object]" data-tesla_locale_processed="1">rotating outages</a> occur due to grid emergencies, and your home is in a curtailed block, an outage can last about one to one and a half hours. Other grid blackouts or <a data-icon-name="null" data-tesla-link-styles="" href="https://prepareforpowerdown.com/" link_icon_name="null" link_styles="[object Object]" data-tesla_locale_processed="1">Public Safety Power Shutoff</a> (PSPS) events may be longer in duration. If outages are planned, check with your utility for the expected duration.</p>

<p>If an outage occurs during the event, your Powerwall will still provide you with energy security using its stored energy.</p>

<h3>Will participation in this program impact my electric bill?</h3>

<p>Tesla expects most events this summer to occur during typical peak hours for many Time-of-Use rate plans. Participating in the event will shift energy exports to periods that are later in the day compared to typical exports. If you are eligible for compensation under a Net Energy Metering (NEM) program, you may earn different credit for exporting at different times.</p>
