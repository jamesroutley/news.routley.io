    <h1>J&amp;J Can’t Use Bankruptcy to Resolve Talc-Injury Lawsuits, Appeals Court Rules</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
         <p>A federal appeals court rejected  Johnson &amp; Johnson ‘s plan to use a legal strategy to push about 38,000 talc lawsuits into bankruptcy court, hampering the controversial tactic the company and a handful of other profitable businesses have used to move mass personal-injury cases to chapter 11.</p>
         <p>The Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday dismissed the chapter 11 case of J&amp;J subsidiary LTL Management LLC, which the consumer-health-goods giant created in 2021 to move to bankruptcy court the mass lawsuits alleging its talc-based baby powder products caused cancer.</p>
