  <p>A personal routine scheduler with flexible timing. If something goes wrong, the scheduler should be able to adjust the rest of the task durations to accomodate. Written in Rust with <a href="https://ratatui.rs/">Ratatui</a>. A TUI was chosen to keep things distraction-free and hopefully low-latency, as these are essential features.</p>
<p>I am to the point where I am using this daily myself. It&#39;s really helpful to offload the getting-ready part of my brain when I&#39;m groggy in the morning. By the time I&#39;m done with the program guiding me through getting ready for the day, I feel much more awake. Right now I use the app <a href="https://termius.com/">terminus</a> on my phone to SSH into my computer to run it. Eventually there will probably be a webapp version, especially once I&#39;m ready to share with other users!</p>
<p>Routines are be stored as portable, human-editable CSV files. Log files are generated for every time a routine is run. The goal of that is to set things up in the future for additional UNIX-philosophy-style tools that can adjust the times budgeted for each task with whatever method the user desires.</p>
