    <p>My &gt;10 year old programming habits have changed since <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code">Claude Code</a> launched. Python is less likely to be my go-to language for new projects anymore. I am managing projects in languages I am not fluent in—TypeScript, Rust and Go—and seem to be doing pretty well.</p>

<p>It seems that typed, compiled, etc. languages are better suited for vibecoding, because of the safety guarantees. This is unsurprising in hindsight, but it was counterintuitive because by default I “vibed” projects into existence in Python since forever.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, after a certain size of project, I can move faster and safer with e.g. Claude Code + Rust, compared to Claude Code + Python, despite the low-levelness of the code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This is possible purely because of AI tools.</p>

<p>For example, I refactored large chunks of our TypeScript frontend code at TextCortex. Claude Code runs <code>tsc</code> after finishing each task and ensures that the code compiles before committing. This let me move much faster compared to how I would have done it in Python, which does not provide compile-time guarantees. I am amazed every time how my 3-5k line diffs created in a few hours don’t end up breaking anything, and instead even increase stability.</p>

<p>LLMs are <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">leaky abstractions</a>, sure. But they now work well enough so that they solve the problem Python solved for me (fast prototyping), without the disadvantages of Python (lower safety guarantees, slowness, ambiguity<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>).</p>

<p>Because of this, I predict a decrease in Python adoption in companies, specifically for production deployments, even though I like it so much.</p>
