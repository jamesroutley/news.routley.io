			<p>Animation brings video games alive. We believe creating great 2D animation requires not only powerful software, but a powerful workflow. Spine is dedicated to 2D skeletal animation, providing an efficient workflow both for creating amazing animation and for integrating it into your games.</p>

			<p>Animating is an iterative process. Spine provides numerous tools to shape and refine your 2D animations. Bend and deform images with mesh skinning/weights, adjust timing with the dopesheet, visualize motion with ghosting, pose your characters with inverse kinematics, create pseudo 3D effects, and much more.</p>

		<div>
			
			<p>Spine doesn&#39;t stop at designing beautiful animations. Export your 2D skeletal animation data, then use our runtime libraries to load and display your animations in your game, just as they do in Spine. We provide runtimes for nearly every major game toolkit and programming language.</p>
