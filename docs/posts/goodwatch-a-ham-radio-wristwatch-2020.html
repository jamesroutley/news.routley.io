        <p>The GoodWatch is my replacement circuit board for Casio’s modern
calculator watches, adding support for 70cm and 33cm amateur bands
while retaining three years of battery life and most of the watch’s
features.  It uses the CC430F6147 chip from Texas Instruments, and the
watchband forms an untuned random wire antenna.  Source code and CAD
files are available on the <a href="https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/goodwatch/">GoodWatch github
repo</a> and documentation
is available in the <a href="https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/goodwatch/wiki/">GoodWatch
wiki</a></p>
<p>Of interest to hams is the <a href="https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/goodwatch/wiki/POCSAG">POCSAG
Receiver</a>
applet, which receives 2FSK 1200baud packages from the
<a href="https://hampager.de/#/">DAPNET</a> project.</p>



    <p><img src="https://kk4vcz.com/goodwatch/pocsag.jpg" alt="POCSAG receiver in a GoodWatch"/></p><p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/goodwatch/wiki/CounterApplet">Frequency
Counter</a>,
which helps to quickly identify the frequency of a nearby transmitter
without extra equipment.  Shown in this photograph, I used my
GoodWatch to find the frequency of a walkie talkie that I imported
from China, then confirmed its guess by tuning my Kenwood TH-D74 to
the correct channel, which was just 50kHz off from the guess.</p>



    <p><img src="https://kk4vcz.com/goodwatch/counter.jpg" alt="Frequency Counter in a GoodWatch"/></p><p>CW modulation from the radio transmitter was a piece of cake, and the
watch will beep the time in Morse if you hold the + key.</p>



    <p><img src="https://kk4vcz.com/goodwatch/morse.jpg" alt="CW transmission from a GoodWatch"/></p><p>Internally, the radio is programmed in C around the RF430 chip’s
CC1100 core.  Phase shift keying and LoRa modulations are not possible
with this radio, but any 2FSK or even 4FSK modulation should be
possible to implement with a bit of clever work and the right test
equipment.  A nice guide for writing <a href="https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/goodwatch/wiki/OOK_Example">OOK
Transmitters</a> is available
to get you started.</p>
