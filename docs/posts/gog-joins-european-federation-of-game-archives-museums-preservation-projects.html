    <h1>GOG Joins European Federation of Game Archives, Museums &amp; Preservation Projects</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p><a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> made a press announcement today to note they&#39;ve joined the European Federation of Game Archives, Museums and Preservation Projects (<a href="https://efgamp.eu/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">EFGAMP</a>).</p>

<p>Nice to see a continued and expanding focus on preserving games, while some publishers continue entirely shutting their games years after release and preventing people playing them.</p>

<p>From the press release:</p>

<p>“GOG was created with video game preservation in mind”, said Maciej Gołębiewski, Managing Director at GOG. “Classic games and the mission to safeguard them for future generations have always been at the core of our work. Over the past decade, we’ve honed our expertise in this area. <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="">The GOG Preservation Program</a>, which ensures compatibility for over 100 games and delivers hundreds of enhancements, is just one example of this commitment. We were thrilled to see the Program warmly received not only by our players but also by our partners and the gaming industry as a whole”.</p>

<p>Gołębiewski further explained that GOG’s role in preservation extends beyond its platform. He highlighted, “As a European company, we feel a responsibility to lead in preserving gaming heritage. Joining EFGAMP reinforces this commitment. Our next step is to expand institutional collaboration with museums and governmental and non-governmental organizations worldwide. We hope our experience will contribute meaningfully to their efforts. We are also discussing exciting new game preservation projects, which we look forward to sharing soon”.</p>



<p>“GOG brings a unique perspective to EFGAMP as a European leader in digital game distribution”, said Andreas Lange, COO of EFGAMP. “Their experience in making classic games accessible to modern audiences complements the work of our existing members by bringing further digital expertise to our collective efforts. As GOG distributes classic games worldwide, GOG is a fantastic addition to EFGAMP, whose members are primarily rooted in the cultural heritage sector”.</p>
