It’s tightly optimized with our Gen AI SDK so it’s easier to generate apps with a simple text, image, or video prompt. The new <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/apps">Build</a> tab is now your gateway to quickly build and deploy AI-powered web apps. We’ve also launched new <a href="http://aistudio.google.com/apps?source=showcase">showcase</a> examples to experiment with new models and more.</p>

    <p data-block-key="ysb9i">Google AI Studio apps and generated code leverage a unique placeholder API key, allowing Google AI Studio to proxy all Gemini API calls. Consequently, when you share your app with Google AI Studio, all API usage by its users is attributed to their Google AI Studio free of charge usage, completely bypassing your own API key and quota. You can read more in our <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apps?source=faq">FAQ</a>.</p><p data-block-key="de0nv">This feature is experimental, so you should always check code before sharing your project externally. Our one-shot generation has been primarily optimized to work with Gemini and Imagen models, with support for more models and tool calls coming soon.</p><h2 data-block-key="cqlne" id=""><b><br/></b>Multimodal generation made easy in Google AI Studio</h2><p data-block-key="3qmu4">We&#39;ve been working hard to get Google DeepMind’s advanced multimodal models into developers’ toolboxes, faster. The new <a href="http://aistudio.google.com/gen-media">Generate Media</a> page centralizes the discovery of Imagen, Veo, Gemini with native image generation, and new native speech generation models. Plus, experience interactive music generation with Lyria RealTime with the PromptDJ apps built in Google AI Studio.</p>

We’ve also added proactive audio so the model can distinguish between the speaker and background conversations, so it knows when to respond. This makes it possible for you to build conversational AI agents and experiences that feel more intuitive and natural.</p>

We’ve included a demo <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/apps/bundled/mcp_maps_basic">app</a> that shows how you can use an MCP server within Google AI Studio that combines Google Maps and the Gemini API</p>
