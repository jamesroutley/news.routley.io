System software can then reliably know what firmware was booted on each processor by asking the root of trust.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Extending Trust Between Devices</p><p>During manufacturing, each hardware root of trust is provisioned with a private key and matching certificate signed by an Oxide Certificate Authority that uniquely identifies that root of trust and demonstrates that it was produced by Oxide.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Trust Quorum</p><p>Verifiable secret sharing protects customer data against at-rest and boot-time attacks.  When combined with remote attestation, this provides a strong guarantee.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Secure Secret Storage</p><p>Specialized storage service that avoids keeping secrets in RAM and has strict ACLs limiting access and use of secrets.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
