<p><b><u><span>Announcement<u></u><u></u></span></u></b></p>

<p><span>After careful consideration during the 3<sup>rd</sup> Round of the NIST PQC Standardization Process, NIST has identified four candidate algorithms for standardization.
</span><span>The primary algorithms NIST recommends be implemented for most use cases are</span><span>
<span>CRYSTALS-KYBER (key-establishment) and CRYSTALS-Dilithium (digital signatures).</span> 
<span>In addition, the signature schemes Falcon and SPHINCS+ will also be standardized.</span></span><span><u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p><b><span>Algorithms to be Standardized<u></u><u></u></span></b></p>
</div>
<div>

<p><u><span>Public-Key Encryption/KEMs<u></u><u></u></span></u></p>
<p><span>CRYSTALS-KYBER<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p><u><span>Digital Signatures<u></u><u></u></span></u></p>
<p><span>CRYSTALS-Dilithium<u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p><span>Falcon<u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p><span>SPHINCS+<u></u><u></u></span></p>
</div>
<div>


<p><span>CRYSTALS-KYBER
</span><span>(key-establishment)</span><span> and CRYSTALS-Dilithium
</span><span>(digital signatures)
</span><span>were both selected for their strong security and excellent performance, and NIST expects them to work well in most applications. Falcon will also be standardized by NIST since there may be use cases for
 which CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures are too large. Additionally, SPHINCS+ will be standardized to avoid only relying on the security of lattices for signatures. NIST asks for public feedback on a version of SPHINCS+ with a lower number of maximum signatures.<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p><span>Additionally, the following candidate KEM algorithms will advance to the fourth round:<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p><b><span>4<sup>th</sup> Round Candidates
<u></u><u></u></span></b></p>
</div>
<div>

<p><u><span>Public-Key Encryption/KEMs</span></u><span><u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p><span>BIKE<u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p><span>Classic McEliece<u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p><span>HQC<u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p><span>SIKE<u></u><u></u></span></p>

</div>
<div>

<p><span>Both BIKE and HQC are based on structured codes, and
</span><span>either <span>
would be suitable as a general-purpose KEM that is not based on lattices.</span> <span>
NIST expects to select at most one of these two candidates for standardization at the conclusion of the</span>
<span>fourth round. SIKE remains an attractive candidate for standardization because of its small</span>
<span>key and ciphertext sizes and will continue to study it in the fourth round. Classic</span>
<span>McEliece was a finalist but is not being standardized by NIST at this time.  Although Classic</span>
<span>McEliece is widely regarded as secure, NIST does not anticipate</span>
<span>it being widely used due to its large public key size. NIST may choose to standardize Classic McEliece at the end of the fourth round.</span><span><u></u><u></u></span></span></p>

<p><span>For the algorithms moving on to the fourth round, NIST will allow the submission teams to provide updated specifications and implementations (“tweaks”). The deadline for these tweaks will
 be <b>October 1, 2022</b>. Any submission team that feels that they may not meet the deadline should contact NIST as soon as possible. NIST will review the proposed modifications and publish the accepted submissions shortly afterwards. As a general guideline,
 NIST expects any modifications to be relatively minor. The fourth round will proceed similarly to the previous rounds. More detailed information and guidance will be provided in another message.<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p><span>A detailed description of the decision process and rationale for selection will be included in NIST Interagency or Internal Report (NISTIR) 8413,
<i>Status Report on the Third Round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process,
</i>which will soon be available at </span><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://csrc.nist.gov/publications&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1657158832450000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1gvRB_yHPO8hU48fzMdl1R"><span>https://csrc.nist.gov/publications</span></a><span>

Questions may be directed to
</span><a href="" data-email-masked="" rel="nofollow"><span>pqc-co...@nist.gov</span></a><span>.
<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p><span>NIST will create new draft standards for the algorithms to be standardized and will coordinate with the submission teams to ensure that the standards comply with the specifications. As part
 of the drafting process, NIST will seek input on specific parameter sets to include, particularly for security category 1. When finished, the standards will be posted for public comment. After the close of the comment period, NIST will revise the draft standards
 as appropriate based on the feedback received. A final review, approval, and promulgation process will then follow.<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p><span>NIST will hold a 4th NIST PQC Standardization Conference on November 29 – December 1, 2022. The conference details have not yet been finalized. The preliminary Call for Papers will be posted,
 both on the pqc-forum and the NIST PQC webpage </span><a href="http://nist.gov/pqcrypto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=http://nist.gov/pqcrypto&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1657158832450000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3tjkF3Kil6h2FT_wamnA2e"><span>http://nist.gov/pqcrypto</span></a><span>.
<u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p><span>NIST also plans to issue a new Call for Proposals for public-key (quantum-resistant) digital signature algorithms by the end of summer 2022. NIST is primarily looking to diversify its signature
 portfolio, so signature schemes that are not based on structured lattices are of greatest interest. NIST would like submissions for signature schemes that have short signatures and fast verification (e.g., UOV). Submissions in response to this call will be
 due by June 1, 2023. Submitters are encouraged to communicate with NIST ahead of time. NIST will decide which (if any) of the submitted signature algorithms to accept and will initiate a new process for evaluation. NIST expects this process to be much smaller
 in scope than the current PQC process. The signature schemes accepted to this process will need to be thoroughly analyzed, which will similarly take several years. 
<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p><span>NIST would like to thank the community and all of the submission teams for their efforts in this standardization process and hopes that the teams whose schemes were not selected to advance
 will continue to participate by evaluating and analyzing the remaining cryptosystems alongside the cryptographic community at large. These combined efforts are crucial to the development of NIST’s future post-quantum public-key standards.<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p><b><span>Guidelines for submitting tweaks for Fourth Round Candidates</span></b><span><u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p><span>Deadline: October 1, 2022<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p><span>Candidate teams must meet the same submission requirements and minimum acceptability criteria stated in the original Call for Proposals. Submissions must be submitted to NIST at
</span><a href="" data-email-masked="" rel="nofollow"><span>pqc-sub...@nist.gov</span></a><span> by October 1, 2022. Submissions should include a cover sheet, algorithm
 specifications (and other supporting documentation), and optical/digital media (e.g., implementations, known-answer test files, etc.) as described in Section 2 of the original Call For Proposals. In addition, NIST requires a short document outlining the modifications
 introduced in the new submission. This document should be included in the supporting documentation folder of the submission (see Section 2.C.4 of the CFP). NIST will review the proposed changes to determine whether they meet the submission requirements and
 minimum acceptability requirements, as well as whether they significantly affect the design of the algorithm and require a major reevaluation. As a general guideline, NIST expects any modifications to be relatively minor.
<span>It would be helpful if submission teams provided NIST with a summary of their expected changes prior to the deadline.
</span>If the deadline will pose a problem for any submission team, they should contact NIST in advance.
<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p><span>NIST does NOT need new signed IP statements unless new submission team members have<u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p><span>been added or the status of intellectual property for the submission has changed. If either of<u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p><span>these cases apply, NIST will need new signed IP statements (see Section 2.D of the CFP). These<u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p><span>statements must be actual hard copies – not digital scans – and must be provided to NIST by the 4<sup>th</sup> NIST PQC Standardization Conference (December 1, 2022).
<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p><span>NIST is aware that some submission packages may be large in size. The email system for pqc-</span><a href="" data-email-masked="" rel="nofollow"><span>submi...@nist.gov</span></a><span>
 can only accept files up to 25MB. For larger files, candidate teams may upload submission packages at a location of their choosing and send NIST the download link. If that option is not suitable, NIST has a file transfer system that can be used (please email
</span><a href="" data-email-masked="" rel="nofollow"><span>pqc-co...@nist.gov</span></a><span> for more details). NIST will review the submitted
 packages as quickly as possible and post the candidate submission packages that are complete and proper on
