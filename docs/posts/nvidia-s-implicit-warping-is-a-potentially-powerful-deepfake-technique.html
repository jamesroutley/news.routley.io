<p>Reorganizations and team changes can be a time of uncertainty for team members. Will they like their new team members and work as much? How will their roles change?</p>
<p>When you&#39;re in an office, a reorg tends to involve a sense of change as a matter of course, as people move their desks around and so on. But for full-remote teams, the transition can be more abrupt if you&#39;re not careful, simply having a different set of squares pop up in your next Zoom meeting.</p>
<p>Our team at <a href="https://trellick.work/writing/joining-wave">Wave</a> recently got to a size where we felt we had to split it to stay effective. This was going to be a sad day for many of us, and I went looking for ideas to help us process the transition. Here&#39;s the process that we ended up leading.</p>
<p>If you try this, I would love to hear about your experiences and variations, so please <a href="https://trellick.work/about">send me a note</a>!</p>
<h2>Goals &amp; Format</h2>
<p>The goal of this meeting is to help the team members mark the transition by recognizing the emotions around the change, and putting their experience in the context of a larger process. To do this, there are <strong>three rounds</strong> of asking every group member share their thoughts &amp; memories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Joining the Old Team: Each person shares a memory of how it felt to join the team originally</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Saying Goodbye: Each person shares a memory involving another team member that they&#39;ll no longer be working with</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Looking Forward: Each person shares something that they&#39;re looking forward to about their new team</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Facilitation Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One or two days before the meeting, share your prompt with the team, so they have some time to prepare their thoughts. Here&#39;s what we used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Go-around #1:</strong> Share a memory of your first impressions of Payments team as it was when you were joining it</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Go-around #2:</strong> Share a memory involving one of your Payments teammates who won’t be on your new team</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Go-around #3:</strong> Share a thought about something you’re looking forward to on your new team</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the first (joining the old team) round, go first in giving your memory, to help break the ice and set the tone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second (leaving the old team) round, try to be one of the last people to go, and keep track of who&#39;s been called out in other people&#39;s memories. That gives you a chance to share memories of anyone who might have been left out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We ran this for a group of 12 on Zoom, and it took us almost exactly an hour. Adjust your time estimates based on group size!</p>
