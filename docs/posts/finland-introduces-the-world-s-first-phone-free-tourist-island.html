Even a short digital fast can be useful and improve our wellbeing and help relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression,” said Terhi Mustonen, psychologist and programme manager of the limitless gaming and limitless social media programmes at the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://sosped.fi/">Sosped Foundation</a>, a social welfare NGO.</p><p>A study from before the pandemic found that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/digital-detox-families-summer-plans-holiday-a8389371.html">almost half of families were planning a summer “digital detox”</a> because they were concerned their children were spending too much time on gadgets.</p><p>In the UK, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://unplugged.rest/">Unplugged</a> offers short breaks in boutique cabins where <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/travel/digital-detox-retreat-uplugged-phone-b1973473.html">guests lock their phone in box for their stay</a>. The rationale is that people would be “happier and more productive if we dedicated time to going offline for a few days each year”.</p><p>Sari Castrén, psychologist and research manager at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, said: “Taking a short break from them means you have more time for new experiences. I’d like to see more initiatives like this that promote digital fasting.”</p><p>For those who fancy going off-grid on Ulko-Tammio, expect hiking trails, a birdwatching tower that offers views over the national park, and plenty of wildlife. Visitors can stay overnight on the island either in tents or in a cabin.</p></div></div>
