<li>been a little while, sorry, hi.</li>
<li>i got told i&#39;m using semicolons wrong in subediting and now i will never use them again. this is like dashes (not em dashes) all over again, it&#39;s almost like i learnt grammar through osmosis rather than being directly taught it! apparently you can use a semicolon to demarcate a list so i was doing that bit right, just not in clauses unless they could be two sentences. but don&#39;t quote me i didn&#39;t fact check them, grammar is for nerds.</li>
<li>speaking of nerdery, i often wish i loved solving puzzles a lot more than i do a lot. i felt like i would be a better developer and maybe even a better person. but then, as <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/075">a podcast</a> i was recently listening to eventually mentions, why do i care if the problem i&#39;m solving is hard in itself so long as i get where i&#39;m trying to go? what&#39;s the obsession with hard problems? there are many solved problems the implementation of the solutions has never or barely happened. maybe i can do that instead and stop trying to be a shiny brilliant star and just join the human tapestry of doing the thing. part of last year&#39;s resolutions was letting go of brilliance as a measure, but it hits me again, silly boomerang of a revelation.</li>
<li>reminding myself to finish a fucking book, as i am still reading blood in the machine, started reading designing an internet, and have many more books that are about to come out and that i have mentioned in weeknotes before that i need to get to. sort it out olu!</li>
<li>i ate easter food a little, but nowhere near as much chocolate as was allowed by the season and i&#39;m a little salty about it. gonna drink aperol spritz now its sunny, and eat fruit salad and sorbet.</li>
<li>i was going to go back through my planning notes to see what happened in my weeknotes gap but i think i&#39;ll spare you, i was a little sad but i feel much better now. thank you for asking.</li>
<li>it&#39;s good to be back, baby! see you next week maybe?</li>
