Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison.<!-- --></p><p>But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,&#34; he says. &#34;So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.&#34;<!-- --></p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2>The &#39;Time Lords&#39;<!-- --></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the &#34;Time Lords&#34; nickname by other horologists.

For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.<!-- --></p><p>The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who&#39;s Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves.<!-- --></p><p>When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,&#34; she tells BBC News.<!-- --></p><p>The NPL&#39;s immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time.<!-- --></p><p>Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. &#34;To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,&#34; says Prof Paul.<!-- --></p><p>Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. &#34;The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,&#34; he says. &#34;There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.&#34;<!-- --></p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/497d/live/033e2bf0-f511-11ef-8c03-7dfdbeeb2526.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/497d/live/033e2bf0-f511-11ef-8c03-7dfdbeeb2526.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/497d/live/033e2bf0-f511-11ef-8c03-7dfdbeeb2526.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/497d/live/033e2bf0-f511-11ef-8c03-7dfdbeeb2526.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/497d/live/033e2bf0-f511-11ef-8c03-7dfdbeeb2526.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/497d/live/033e2bf0-f511-11ef-8c03-7dfdbeeb2526.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/497d/live/033e2bf0-f511-11ef-8c03-7dfdbeeb2526.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/497d/live/033e2bf0-f511-11ef-8c03-7dfdbeeb2526.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="UK MOD Grant Shapps on a plane which experienced GPS jamming"/><span>UK MOD</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>In March 2024, the then Defence Secretary Grant Shapps experienced GPS jamming first-hand when his plane lost signal while flying near Russian territory<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>While this type of research is taking place around the world, it&#39;s being led by the UK.
