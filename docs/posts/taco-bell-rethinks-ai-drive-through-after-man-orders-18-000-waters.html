he said.</p><p>He said the firm was &#34;learning a lot&#34; - but he would now think carefully about where to use AI going forwards, including not using it at drive-throughs.</p><p>In particular, Mr Matthews said, there are times when humans are better placed to take orders, especially when the restaurants get busy. </p><p>&#34;We&#39;ll help coach teams on when to use voice AI and when it&#39;s better to monitor or step in,&#34; he said. </p><p>The issues have been building online as disgruntled customers take to social media to complain about the service - with many pointing out glitches and issues.</p><p>One clip on Instagram, which has been viewed over 21.5 million times, shows a man ordering &#34;a large Mountain Dew&#34; and the AI voice continually replying &#34;and what will you drink with that?&#34;.</p><p>It isn&#39;t the first time there has been issues with AI not getting it right when it comes to processing food and drink orders.  </p><p>Last year <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c722gne7qngo">McDonald&#39;s withdrew AI from its own drive-throughs</a> as the tech misinterpreted customer orders - resulting in one person getting bacon added to their ice cream in error, and another having hundreds of dollars worth of chicken nuggets mistakenly added to their order.</p><p>But despite some of the viral glitches facing Taco Bell, it says two million orders have been successfully processed using the voice AI since its introduction.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250828-055926-c20c0c03f5-2.28.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="A green promotional banner with black squares and rectangles forming pixels, moving in from the right.
