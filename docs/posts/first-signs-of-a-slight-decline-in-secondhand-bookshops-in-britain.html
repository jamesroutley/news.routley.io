    <h1>First signs of a slight decline in secondhand bookshops in Britain</h1>

of <a href="https://www.thebookguide.info/" target="_blank">The Book Guide</a>, which lists second-hand bookshops in Britain (and Ireland),
together with reviews by customers. </p>



<p>This invaluable resource had earlier made it possible to see
that, contrary to popular belief, the number of second-hand bookshops in the UK
had increased by about 25% over a thirty year period, not declined. The Guide had
listed around 1,187 bookshops in the UK in 2017, compared to 942 in Driff’s exhaustive
guide of 1984: and their scope was broadly similar. </p>



<p>We can now review the position after 12 months of the
relaunched guide. Sadly, about 117 bookshops have closed over the year. By contrast, I count about
47 newly opened or newly discovered shops that have been notified. The net change is
therefore minus 70. That is for the first time a significant fall, as distinct
from minor changes in the ups and downs of the total. </p>



<p>The guide depends entirely on volunteer information as
readers get out and about visiting, and reporting on, what they find. It could
be that there are more closures yet to be reported, though there may also be
newly opened shops too. </p>



<p>Even so, it is worth reminding ourselves that in historical
terms the total is still among the highest. There are still 1,021 or so
secondhand bookshops in the UK, compared to Driff’s 942 of 38 years ago. </p><p><i>Addendum</i>: I should perhaps have included a link to my first post on this subject, <a href="https://wormwoodiana.blogspot.com/2017/09/the-rise-of-secondhand-bookshops-in.html" target="_blank">The Rise of Secondhand Bookshops in Britain</a>, in which I first suggested that the story of a decline wasn&#39;t (then) supported by the facts. I also discuss there the reasons why the story persists.</p><p>(Mark Valentine)</p>
