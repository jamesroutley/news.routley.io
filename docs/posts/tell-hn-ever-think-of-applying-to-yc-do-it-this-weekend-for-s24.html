    <h1>Tell HN: Ever think of applying to YC? Do it this weekend for S24</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>(Usually I put an &#34;Apply to YC&#34; thing in the HN footer [1] but I forgot this time, so here is my pitch to make up for it.)</p><p>If you&#39;ve ever thought about applying to YC, here&#39;s a tip: just do it. It doesn&#39;t take long and could change your life, like it did for me and many others.</p><p>In particular, if you have either of these two bogus thoughts, ignore them pronto and just go to <a href="https://apply.ycombinator.com" rel="nofollow">https://apply.ycombinator.com</a> and apply:</p><p>(1) &#34;probably not good enough / won&#39;t get in&#34; - you&#39;d be surprised at how many people feel that way, whether because of impostor syndrome, lack of credentials, whatever—and often they turn out to be among the best founders. So this a terrible reason not to apply!</p><p>The nice thing is, it&#39;s YC&#39;s job to evaluate that, not yours. They&#39;re looking for aptitude which doesn&#39;t look like what most people (probably including you) assume. You needn&#39;t look impressive, and you don&#39;t have to be a competent founder—you learn that from doing YC. Just be yourself as you are, fill out the application and don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p>(2) &#34;too early&#34; - there&#39;s no such thing. YC looks for good potential founders—meaning anyone who can learn what they teach—and nothing else. You&#39;re already yourself, which is all you need.</p><p>Some of YC&#39;s big successes start off as last-minute applications on a whim; and many start with totally different ideas than what ends up succeeding. It&#39;s YC&#39;s job to teach you how to develop in the startup way, and that can start at any time.</p><p>(&#34;Too far along already&#34; is another bogus notion but I&#39;ll stick with the top 2 for today.)</p><p>If you know the game Snakes and Ladders [2], YC is a massive ladder in an area where there are no snakes. Sure it&#39;s a dice roll, but what reason do you have not to? If you&#39;re uninterested in the game, no problem—but if you have any impulse to participate, do it! If you&#39;re the &#34;out of nowhere&#34; type of founder YC loves to fund, your chances are likely a lot better than you imagine.</p><p>Apply by 8pm PT on Monday 4/22 to get a decision by May 29: <a href="https://apply.ycombinator.com" rel="nofollow">https://apply.ycombinator.com</a>.</p><p>---</p><p>[1] like last October - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231011022307/https://news.ycombinator.com/" rel="nofollow">https://web.archive.org/web/20231011022307/https://news.ycom...</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders</a></p></div></td></div></div>
