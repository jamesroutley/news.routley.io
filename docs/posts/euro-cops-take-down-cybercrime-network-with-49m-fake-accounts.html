                        <p>European police forces have arrested seven people and dismantled a large-scale cybercrime-as-a-service operation that saw almost 50 million fake online accounts created across social media and communications platforms for fraud purposes.</p>

<p>The coordinated takedown, codenamed Operation <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cybercrime-service-takedown-7-arrested" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIMCARTEL</a>, took place on October 10 in Latvia, as part of a joint investigation by police in the Baltic nation, Austria, Estonia and Finland.</p>
<p>Five Latvian nationals and two additional suspects were arrrested by police.</p>
<p>In the raid, authorities seized 1200 SIM boxes, with the devices containing 40,000 active SIM cards.</p>
<p>Five Internet servers were taken down, along with two websites that had been offering the illegal service, gogetsms.com and apisim.com.</p>

<p>The network operated as a for-hire service, providing temporary telephone numbers from more than 80 countries to criminals who needed to mask their identities whilst committing cybercrimes.</p>
<p>Fraudsters used the service to bypass two-factor authentication systems so as to create vast numbers of fake accounts.</p>
<p>Once created, the bogus accounts served as starting points for various scams including investment fraud, fake online shops, and phishing attacks.</p>
<p>The infrastructure facilitated a range of offences including fraud, extortion, migrant smuggling and the distribution of child sexual abuse material.</p>
<p>Scammers employed tactics including the &#34;daughter-son scam&#34;, where criminals persuaded victims that their child needed urgent financial help, alongside more traditional phishing and smishing attacks.</p>
<p>Some of the criminals specialised in fraud on second-hand marketplaces, whilst others set up fake investment websites and bogus online shops.</p>
<p>In other cases, criminals impersonated police officers using forged identification, personally collecting funds from victims.</p>
<p>Financial losses in Austria alone are said to be to around €4.5 million ($7.4 million), with an additional €420,000 ($693,000) lost in Latvia.</p>
<p>Around €431,000 ($711,000) was seized from the criminals&#39; bank accounts, along with approximately $516,000 worth of crypto currency.</p>
<p>Police investigators working with Europol and Eurojust, attributed over 1700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1500 in Latvia to the criminal network.</p>
<p>Europol provided analytical support, open-source intelligence analysis for mapping the online criminal service, and forensic expertise to secure digital evidence.</p>
<p>The agency worked with the not-for-profit <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/search/?q=shadowserver" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadowserver Foundation</a> security organisation to dismantle the technical infrastructure.</p>
<p>In September this year, United States law enforcement <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/us-secret-service-seizes-new-york-city-sim-farm-near-un-620522">busted another &#34;SIM farm&#34;</a>, with 300 devices and with over 100,000 subscriber identity cards found on the site near the United Nations headquarters in New York City.</p>
<p>The US Secret Service was involved in the raid in New York, and suspected nation-state threat actors were operating the SIM farm.</p>
