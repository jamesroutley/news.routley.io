    <h1>The skill of the future is not &#39;AI&#39;, but &#39;Focus&#39;</h1>

			<p>If you frequent Hacker News regurlarly, you have likely noticed the buzz around engineers using AI
(specifically Large Language Models, or LLMs) to tackle Computer Science problems.</p>
<p>I want to be clear: <strong>Iâ€™m not against LLMs</strong>.</p>
<p>A key concern with LLMs lies in their training data.</p>
<p>This reliance on readily available solutions, particularly for familiar problems, creates a real risk: engineers may inadvertently atrophy their own problem-solving skills, hindering their ability to tackle truly novel challenges.</p>
<p>This idea summarizes why I disagree with those who equate the LLM revolution to the rise of search engines, like Google in the 90s.
Search enginers offer a good choice between <em>Exploration</em> (crawl through the list and pages of results) and
<em>Exploitation</em> (click on the top result).</p>
<p>Computer Science emerged because Humans needed <strong>tools</strong> to solve problems faster and wanted to <strong>focus</strong> on the real problems, not repetitive tasks.
Humans built machines to accelerate problem-solving, but engineers remained the masters of the algorithms.</p>
<p>This is a worrying trend. If engineers become less adept at solving complex problems, what does the future hold?
Will our ability to tackle complex challenges rest solely on self-reflecting AIs, rather than human ingenuity?</p>
