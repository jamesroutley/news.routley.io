<a href="https://github.com/alphapapa">Adam Porter</a> (alphapapa) reached out to <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley">John
Wiegley</a> (johnw) to ask about his current Org Mode
workflow. John figured he&#39;d experiment with a
braindumping/brainstorming conversation about Org
Mode in the hopes of getting more thoughts out of
his head and into articles or blog posts. Instead
of waiting until someone finally gets the time to
polish it into something beautifully concise and
insightful, they decided to let me share snippets
of the transcript in case that sparks other ideas.
Enjoy!

<div id="outline-container-org-review">
<h2 id="org-review">John on meetings as a CTO and using org-review</h2>
<div id="text-org-review">
<blockquote>
<p>
Today I was playing a lot with <a href="https://github.com/brabalan/org-review">org-review</a>. I&#39;m
just trying to really incorporate a strong review
process because one of the things I started doing
recently is that this <a href="https://fireflies.ai/">[Fireflies AI]​</a> note taker
that&#39;s running in the background. Now, it produces
terrible transcripts, but it produces great
summaries. And at the bottom of every summary,
there&#39;s a list of all the action items that
everyone talked about associated with the names.
</p>

<p>
So I now have some automation, that will all I
have to do is download the Word document and then
I have a whole process in the background that uses
Pandoc to convert it to Org Mode. Then I have
Elisp code that automatically will suck it into
the file that I dedicate to that particular
meeting. It will auto-convert all of the action
items into Org-mode tasks where it&#39;s either a TODO
if it&#39;s for me, or if it&#39;s a task for somebody
else, tagged with their name.
</p>

<p>
Then, when I have a one-on-one with a person in
the future, I now have a one-on-one template that
populates that file, and part of the template is
under the agenda heading. It uses an a dynamic
block that I&#39;ve written: a new type of dynamic
block that can pull from any agenda file. And what
it does is it [takes] from all of those meetings,
all of the action items that are still open that
are tagged with their name.
</p>

<p>
This has been actually really, really effective.
Now, I don&#39;t jump into a one-on-one being like,
&#34;Well, I didn&#39;t prepare so I don&#39;t know what to
talk about.&#34; I&#39;ve usually got like 10 to 30 items
to go through with them to just see. Did you
follow up? Did you complete this? Do we need to
talk about this more?
</p>

<p>
I want to incorporate org-review. Scheduling is
not sufficient for me to see my tasks. What I need
is something that is like scheduling, but isn&#39;t
scheduling. That&#39;s where org-review comes in. I
have a report that says: show me everything that
has never been reviewed or everything that is up
for review.
</p>

<p>
Then I have a whole Org key space within agenda
for pushing the next review date to a selected
date or a fixed quantity of time. So if I hit <code>r
r</code>, it&#39;ll prompt for the date that I want to see
that again. But if I hit <code>r w</code>, it&#39;ll just push it
out a week.
</p>

<p>
Every day I try to spend 15 minutes looking at the
review list of all the tasks that are subject for
review. I don&#39;t force myself to get through the
whole list. I count it as success if I get through
20 of the tasks. Because earlier I had 730 of
them, right? I was just chewing on them day by
day.
</p>

<p>
But now I&#39;m building this into the Org agenda
population, because in the dynamic block match
query, I can actually say: only populate this
agenda with the tasks that are tagged for them
that are up for review. That way, if we&#39;re in the
one-on-one and they say, &#34;Oh I&#39;m working on that
but I won&#39;t get to it for a month,&#34; I&#39;ll say,
&#34;Let&#39;s review that in a month.&#34; Then next week&#39;s
one-on-one won&#39;t show that tasks. I don&#39;t have to
do that mental filtering each time.
</p>

<p>
This is something I&#39;ve been now using for a few
weeks. I have to say I&#39;m still streamlining, I&#39;m
still getting all the inertia out of the system by
automation as much as possible, but it&#39;s helping
me stay on top of a lot of tasks.
</p>

<p>
I&#39;m surprised by how many action items every
single meeting generates. It&#39;s like, it&#39;s like
between 5 and 12 per meeting. And I have 3 to 7
meetings a day, so you can imagine that we&#39;re
generating up to a hundred action items a week.
</p>

<p>
In the past, I think a lot of it was just subject
to the whims of people&#39;s memory. They&#39;ll say, &#34;I&#39;m
going to do that,&#34; and then… Did they remember to
do that? Nobody&#39;s following up. Three months later, somewhere,
they&#39;ll go like, &#34;Oh yeah we talked about that, didn&#39;t we?&#34;
</p>

<p>
So I&#39;m trying to now stem the the tide of lost
ideas. [My current approach] combines dynamic
blocks with <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">org-roam</a> templates to make new files
for every meeting and it combines org-review to
narrow down the candidate agendas each time
appropriately, and it combines a custom command to
show me a list of all tasks that are currently
needing review.
</p>

<p>
Reviewing isn&#39;t just about, &#34;Is the thing done?&#34;
It&#39;s also, &#34;Did I tag it with the right names? Did
I delegate? Did I associate an effort quantity to
it?&#34; (I&#39;m using efforts now as a way to quickly
flag whether a day has become unrealistically over-full.)
</p>

<p>
I only started using <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Column-View.html">column view</a> very, very
recently. I&#39;ve never used it before. But now that
I&#39;m using <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Effort-Estimates.html">effort strings</a>, it does have some nice
features to it: the ability to see your properties
laid out in a table.

<div id="outline-container-distinctions">
<h2 id="distinctions">John on making meaningful distinctions (semantic or operational)</h2>
<div id="text-distinctions">
<blockquote>
<p>
Today&#39;s agenda has 133 items on it. I need
ways to narrow that agenda down.
</p>

<p>
I&#39;ve used a lot of different tasks management
philosophies. We&#39;re always looking for more
efficiency, and we&#39;re looking for more personal
adaptation to what works for us. I&#39;ve gone
from system to system. What I&#39;m starting to realize is
that the real value in all of these
systems is that they&#39;re different
enough from whatever you&#39;re using
today, that they will force you to
think about the system you&#39;re making
for yourself, that is their value.
</p>

<p>
That&#39;s why I think there should always be a huge
variety of such systems and people should always
be exploring them. I don&#39;t believe any one one
system can work for everybody, but we all need to
be reflecting on the systems that we use. Somebody
else showing you, &#34;Hey, I do it this way&#34; is a
really nice way to juxtapose whatever system
you&#39;re using.
</p>

<p>
I discovered through reading Karl Voit&#39;s articles
that there are three
principal information activities: searching, filtering, and browsing.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Hierarchies</b> assist with browsing.</li>
<li><b>Tagging</b> assist with filtering and keywords.</li>
<li><b>Metadata</b> assist with searching.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Those are the three general ways
that we approach our data.
</p>

<p>
We have to do work to draw distinctions between
that data. The whole reason that we&#39;re drawing
distinctions between that data is to narrow our
focus to what is important.
</p>

<p>
I have over 30,000 tasks in my Org Mode
overall. 23,000 of them are TODOs. Several
thousand of them are still currently open. I&#39;m
never gonna see them all. Even if I wanted to, I&#39;m
never gonna see them all. I don&#39;t know what to
search for. I don&#39;t know what the query should be.
I have to use tagging and scheduling and
categorization and everything.
I believe that that is the work
of a knowledge worker is to introduce
these distinctions. That takes
time and it takes effort.
</p>

<p>
What&#39;s really important is to draw meaningful
distinctions. Make distinctions that matter.
</p>

<p>
I could tag things with like the next time I go to
Walmart, so that I could do a filtered query to
show me all things that I might want to do at
Walmart, but is that worth the effort or is just
tagging it as an errand enough? Because that list
will get within the size range that I can now
eyeball them all and mentally filter out the
ones that I need for Walmart.
</p>

<p>
What makes a meaningful distinction? I
believe there are two things that make a
distinction meaningful. One is semantic, and one
is operational.
</p>

<p>
A <b>semantic distinction</b> is a distinction that
changes the meaning of the task. If I have a task
that says &#34;Set up Zoom account&#34;, if that&#39;s in my
personal Org Mode, that has one level of priority
and one level of focused demand. If it&#39;s in my
work list, that has a totally different importance
and a totally different focused demand. It changes
the nature of the task from one that is low
urgency (maybe a curiosity) to high urgency that
might impact many people or affect how I can get
my work done. That distinction is meaningful or
semantic. It changes the meaning of the task.
</p>

<p>
An <b>operational distinction</b> changes how I
interact with the task. [For example, if I tag a
phone call, I can] group all of my phone calls
during a certain time of the day. That changes
my nature of interaction with the task. I&#39;m doing
it at a different time of day or doing it in
conjunction with other tasks. That helps narrow my
focus during that section of time that I have
available for making calls. It&#39;s an operational
distinction. if it&#39;s changing how you interact
with the task.
</p>

<p>
You&#39;re succeeding at all of this if on any given
day and any given time, <b>what&#39;s in front of your
eyes is what should be in front of your eyes</b>.
That&#39;s what all of this is about. If an
operational distinction is not aiding you in that
effort, it&#39;s <b>not worth doing</b>. It&#39;s not
meaningful enough to go above the bar.

<div id="outline-container-ex-distinctions">
<h2 id="ex-distinctions">John on examples of distinctions that weren&#39;t personally worth it</h2>
<div id="text-ex-distinctions">
<blockquote>
<p>
I&#39;m trying to narrow and optimize down to the
minimum distinctions necessary to remain
effective. If I can ever get rid of a distinction,
I&#39;m happy to do it.
</p>

<p>
I used to have projects and have categories,
or what <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/">PARA</a> method calls areas.
Projects are different from areas and
that they have a definition of
completion and they have a deadline,
but that&#39;s the only distinction.
I realized that distinction
doesn&#39;t do me any good because
if it has a deadline, that&#39;s the distinction, right?
</p>

<p>
Calling it an area or calling it a project… I
can just have projects without deadlines and then
that&#39;s good enough. I have a query that shows me
all projects whose deadlines are coming up within
the next month, and then I&#39;m aware of what I need
to be aware of. I don&#39;t need to make the
distinction between the ones that have and don&#39;t
have deadlines. I just need to assign a deadline
so the deadline was sufficient discrimination. I
didn&#39;t need the classification difference between
area and project.
</p>

<p>
And then [PARA&#39;s] distinction between projects,
areas, and archives. I realize that there&#39;s only
one operational benefit of an archive, and it&#39;s to
speed things up by excluding archives from the Org
ID database or from the org-roam-dbsync. That&#39;s
it. That&#39;s the only reason I would ever exclude
archives, because I want to search in archives.
org-agenda-custom-commands is already only looking
at open tasks. In a way, it&#39;s by implication
archiving anything that&#39;s done in terms of its
meaning.
</p>

<p>
This is all just an
example of me looking at the para
method and realizing that none of
their distinctions really meant something for me.
</p>

<p>
What was meaningful was:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it have a deadline?</li>
<li>Is it bounded or not bounded?</li>
<li>Do I want to included in the processing of items?</li>
<li>[Is it a habit?]</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-habits">
<h2 id="habits">John on habits</h2>
<div id="text-habits">
<blockquote>
<p>
I did decide to draw the distinction of habits. I
want them to look and feel different because I&#39;m
trying to become more habit-heavy.
</p>

<p>
I read this really brilliant book called <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic
Habits</a> that I think has changed my life more than
any other. I&#39;ve read a lot of really good time
management books but this book far and away has
made the biggest impact on my life. One of its
philosophical points that it makes that is so
profound is that goal-oriented thinking is less
successful in the long run than behavior-oriented
thinking or habit- or system-oriented thinking.
Instead of having a goal to clean your office,
have a habit to remove some piece of clutter from
your office like each time you stand up to go get
a snack. You seek habits that in the aggregate
will achieve the goals you seek to do.
</p>

<p>
I&#39;m trying now to shift a lot of things in my
to-do lists that were goals. I&#39;m trying to
identify the habits that will create systems of
behavior that will naturally lead to those goals.
I want habits to be first
class citizens, and I want to be
aware of the habits I&#39;m creating.
</p>

<p>
I think the other thing that Atomic Habits
did is it changed my conception of what a habit
is. Before, I thought of a habit as &#34;using the
exercise bike&#34; or something like that, which
always made it a big enough task that I would keep
pushing it off. Then I would realize I&#39;d pushed it
off for six months and then I would unschedule it
and give up on it because it was just it would
just be glaring at me with a look of doom from my
agenda list.
</p>

<p>
What&#39;s important is the consistency,
not the impact of any one particular
accomplishing of that habit.
It&#39;s a habit.
If I do it daily, it&#39;s doesn&#39;t matter
how much of it I do.
So even if it just means I get on the
bike and I spin the pedals for three
minutes, literally, that&#39;s successful
completion.
</p>

<p>
Any time you have a new habit, one of the
activities in mastering that habit is to keep
contracting the difficulty of the habit down,
down. You&#39;ve got to make it so stupidly small and
simple to do, that you do it just for the fun of
marking it done in the agenda, right?
</p>

<p>
I have a habit to review my vocabulary lists
for languages that I&#39;m learning. I&#39;m okay with one
word. As long as I ran the app and I studied
one word, that&#39;s success.
</p>

<p>
What you find happening is that you&#39;ll do the one
word, and now because you&#39;re there, because you&#39;re
in the flow of it, you&#39;re like, &#34;I&#39;ll do two. You know, I&#39;m already here.
What&#39;s the big difficulty in doing
two?&#34;
</p>

<p>
So you make the success bar super
low. You&#39;re trying to almost
trick yourself into getting into the
flow of whatever that activity is.
</p>

<p>
[org-habit org-ql list] So I have all of these
habits here, and every single habit on this list
is super easy to do. Five minutes is all that it
would take, or even one minute for most of them. I
use different little icons to group them. It also
keeps the title of the habit really small. I found
that when the titles were really long. I didn&#39;t
like reading it all the time. It just was a wall
of text. When it&#39;s these one word plus an icon, it
just kind of jumps out.

I took that to a bit of an extreme sort
of with my my package remote called <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/hammy.el">Hammy</a>, for
hamster. It&#39;s for timers and ideas, kind of like
being a hamster on a hamster wheel.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, one of the timers is called flywheel
mode. The idea is: just do a little bit. Like, if
I&#39;m just having a mental block, I can&#39;t stand working
on that test today, I&#39;m going to do five minutes.
I can spend five minutes doing whatever. Next
time, we do 10 minutes in 15. Pretty soon, I&#39;m
doing 45 minutes at a stretch. Maybe when I sit
down to do 5, I&#39;ll actually do 15. I&#39;m just slowly building up that
mental momentum. I&#39;ll allow myself to quit after
5 minutes, but I end up doing 20.

<div id="text-momentum">
<blockquote>
<p>
Momentum is key. There&#39;s a flip side to this whole
concept of the value of iterative improvement. The
opposite remains also true.
</p>

<p>
<b>Consistent good is your best ally, and inconsistent bad is also your ally.</b> It&#39;s when the
reverse is true that you have inconsistent good
and consistent bad, that&#39;s what leads you into
roads of doom.
</p>

<p>
That never occurred to me before. I would always
be one of those people who would set myself up
with a goal, like, I want to lose 20 pounds. I
would struggle to achieve it. I would be dismayed
because of how hard it was to get there, and then
you&#39;d have a day when you&#39;re like, you get off the
wagon and you&#39;re like, The game is lost. And then
and then you can&#39;t get back on again. Whereas now
it&#39;s like that wagon, it&#39;s not so easy to get off
of. I have to really make a concerted effort to be
consistently bad in order to make things horrible
again.
</p>

<p>
I almost want to change org-habit to have a
different kind of visualization, because streaks
are not motivators for me. Streaks punish you for
losing one day out of 200, right? I don&#39;t want a
graph that shows me streaks. I want a graph that
shows me consistency. If I have 200 days and I&#39;ve
missed five of them, I&#39;m super consistent. Maybe I
could do this with colors. Just show a bar with
that color, and don&#39;t show individual asterisks to
show when I did it or when I didn&#39;t do it, because
I find streaks anti-motivating.

[Discussion about other ways to display habits]

<h2 id="lifebalance">John on Life Balance by Llamagraphics</h2>
<div id="text-lifebalance">
<blockquote>
<p>
The whole principle around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190218084858/http://llamagraphics.com/products/life-balance">Life Balance [by Llamagraphics]​</a> was: you take all of your tasks,
you categorize them, you associate difficulty
to them and priority and everything else. Then
it tries to use heuristics to determine if
your life is being balanced, [and it percolates certain tasks to the top of your list].
</p>

<p>
If the system&#39;s doing a
good job, then your agenda list
should always be A-Z pretty much
the best order in which you ought to
do things.
It didn&#39;t just do category-based
balance, it also did difficulty-based
balance. You should only be
doing super hard stuff once in a while. You do a hard
thing, then you do lots of easy
things, then you do a hard thing.
</p>

<p>
Now, I&#39;m wondering… This idea of
momentum is very similar to the idea
of balance.
&#34;Have established momentum
with a system of behavior&#34; is similar
to &#34;Have an established balance with
all of the tasks that I do related to
different activities.&#34;
Is there a data architecture that would allow me to do both of
these things.
</p>

<p>
The whole idea of making the habits be colors and
then sorting them according to the spectrum is
literally just to achieve balance among how much
attention I&#39;m paying to different habits.

My fundamental system right now is

There&#39;s the view of tasks that are
scheduled for today or have a
deadline of today,
and then there&#39;s a view of tasks that
I&#39;ve decided that they
need to be done, but I haven&#39;t
decided when to do them yet.
</p>

<p>
[Top list]: I just pick the next task off the list
or reschedule if it&#39;s not important enough now.
But then when that&#39;s empty, if it ever gets that
way, it&#39;s the second view. I decide, okay, there&#39;s
something I need to do. I can do that on Tuesday.
Then it disappears until I need to think about it
again.
</p>

<p>
This separates deciding what to do from when to

The top view is basically tasks that have a

deadline today or in the past), or it&#39;s an item
that I&#39;ve scheduled to work on today or in the
past.
</p>

<p>
The view below, that is items that have no
planning date. I need to give them one, or maybe
they can just sit in that list of projects that
have no next task. I use a project heading to
[note] something that needs to be subdivided if I
don&#39;t have a next task for it, then that&#39;ll show
up there to remind me to give it one. Once it has
a next task, [that] task would appear instead of
the project heading until I schedule it. Anything
I&#39;ve forgotten to schedule yet will show up in
that list.
</p>

<p>
Below that I just have
a small window that shows me things.
I&#39;ve completed or clocked in the past
week.
</p>

<p>
And then, another small window shows me anything
that&#39;s a project status so I can get an overview.
</p>

<p>
In the work file itself, I have a number of links
to org-ql views, like &#34;Show me all my top level
projects,&#34; &#34;Show me tasks I need to talk to my
boss about&#34; or somebody else.

<h2 id="org-checker">John on Org and data consistency</h2>
<div id="text-org-checker">
<blockquote>
<p>
Org Mode is really a database, right?
It&#39;s a database of of highly
structured data that has a lot of
associated metadata.
</p>

<p>
The value of that data requires a certain
level of consistency which is work that we have to
do. In the same way we do work drawing
distinctions, we need to do work to keep that data
consistent. Am I using this [property]? Am I using
this tag to mean the right thing or whatever? Karl
Voit says that one of the most valuable things if
you&#39;re going to use tagging to organize your data
is a constrained tag vocabulary. Make a fixed
list. Then it&#39;s an error if you tag something and
it&#39;s not in that list, because you either need to
expand the list or you need to choose a better
tag. That&#39;s really valuable.
</p>

<p>
Even though I use <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Org-Syntax.html">org-lint</a> on all my org files, I
found serious data errors. [The newline before an
initial star had been lost], and then Org wouldn&#39;t
see the entry. I never knew that it wasn&#39;t even
being a participant in any of my queries. I just didn&#39;t know stuff like that.
</p>

<p>
I created a whole bunch of Haskell libraries that
allow me to <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/org-jw">parse Org Mode data</a>. It&#39;s a very
opinionated parser. It&#39;s a very strict parser. It
will not parse data files that do not have the
exact shape and text and taxonomy that I want.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/org-jw/blob/main/org-lint/src/Org/Lint.hs">linting module</a> that basically encodes
every single rule that I have ever wanted to apply
to my data. Like, in the title of an Org Mode
heading. I don&#39;t want two spaces. I don&#39;t want
extra excess white space. That should be a rule
right?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
[Multiple examples, including when a file had TODO
entries but didn&#39;t have a TODO filetag.]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
My linter makes sure that this rule is
consistently maintained. Being able to have an
aggressive, thorough, universal consistency
throughout all of my org data has really put my
mind at ease. I can&#39;t break my data because I just
won&#39;t be able to commit the broken data into git.
I find myself adding new linting rules on a weekly
basis. The more that I add, the more value my data
has, because the more regular it is, the more
normal, the more searchable.
