Haines, did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div><div><div><p>The N.S.A. <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/0117fa5f9ff7ae33/fe33e1ba-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made its specific disclosure under pressure</a> in a letter that its departing director, Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, sent last month to Mr. Wyden. In November, the senator <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-nsa-must-answer-whether-it-is-buying-americans-location-data-and-web-browsing-records-before-new-director-is-confirmed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">placed a hold</a> on President Biden’s nominee to be the next agency director, Lt. Gen. Timothy D. Haugh, to prevent the Senate from voting on his confirmation until the agency publicly disclosed whether it was buying the location data and web browsing records of Americans.</p><p>In the letter, General Nakasone wrote that his agency had decided to reveal that it buys and uses various types of commercially available metadata for its foreign intelligence and cybersecurity missions, including netflow data “related to wholly domestic internet communications.”</p><p>Netflow data generally means internet metadata <a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2812391&amp;seqNum=2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that shows when computers or servers have connected</a> but does not include the content of their interactions. Such records can be generated when people visit different websites or use smartphone apps, but the letter did not specify how detailed the data is that the agency buys.</p><p>Asked to clarify, an N.S.A. official provided a statement that said that the agency purchases commercially available netflow data for its cybersecurity mission of trying to detect, identify and thwart foreign hackers. It stressed that “at all stages, N.S.A. takes steps to minimize the collection of U.S. person information,” including by using technical means to filter it.</p><p>The statement added that it limited its netflow data to internet communications in which one side is a computer address inside the United States “and the other side is foreign, or where one or both communicants are foreign intelligence targets, such as a malicious cyberactor.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>While General Nakasone also acknowledged that some of the data the N.S.A. purchases is “associated with electronic devices being used outside — and, in certain cases, inside — the United States,” he said that the agency did not buy domestic location information, including from phones or internet-linked cars known to be in the country.</p><p>Mr. Wyden, a longtime privacy advocate and surveillance skeptic who has access to classified information as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has proposed legislation that would bar the government from purchasing data about Americans that it would otherwise need a court order to obtain.</p><p>In early 2021, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/us/politics/dia-surveillance-data.html" title="">obtained a memo</a> revealing that the Defense Intelligence Agency buys commercially available databases containing location data from smartphone apps and had searched it several times without a warrant for Americans’ past movements. The senator has been trying to persuade the government to publicly disclose more about its practices.</p><p>The correspondence with Mr. Wyden, a portion of which was redacted as classified, strongly suggested that other arms of the Defense Department also buy such data.</p><p>Law enforcement and intelligence agencies outside the Defense Department also purchase data about Americans in ways that have drawn mounting scrutiny. In September, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-09/OIG-23-61-Sep23-Redacted.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">faulted several of its units</a> for buying and using smartphone location data in violation of privacy policies. <a href="https://www.404media.co/customs-and-border-protection-stop-buying-location-data/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Customs and Border Protection has also indicated</a> that it would stop buying such data.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Another <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/0117fa5f9ff7ae33/fe33e1ba-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter</a> to Mr. Wyden, by Ronald S. Moultrie, the under secretary of defense for intelligence and security, said that acquiring and using such data from commercial brokers was subject to various safeguards.</p><p>He said the Pentagon used the data lawfully and responsibly to carry out its various missions, including detecting hackers and protecting American service members. There is no legal bar to buying data that was “equally available for purchase to foreign adversaries, U.S. companies and private persons as it is to the U.S. government,” he added.</p><p>But in his own letter to Ms. Haines, Mr. Wyden urged intelligence agencies to adjust their practices, pointing to the Federal Trade Commission’s recent crackdown on companies that sell personal information.</p><p>This month, the F.T.C. <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/01/ftc-order-prohibits-data-broker-x-mode-social-outlogic-selling-sensitive-location-data" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banned a data broker formerly known as X-Mode Social</a> from selling locational data as part of a first-of-its kind settlement. The agreement established that the agency considers trading location data — which was collected without the consent of consumers that it would be sold to government contractors for national security purposes — to be a violation of a provision of the Federal Trade Commission Act that bars unfair and deceptive practices.</p><p>And last week, the F.T.C. <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/01/ftc-order-will-ban-inmarket-selling-precise-consumer-location-data" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unveiled a proposed settlement</a> with another data aggregator, InMarket Media, that bars it from selling precise location data if it did not fully inform customers and obtain their consent — even if the government is not involved.</p></div></div><div><div><p>While the N.S.A. does not appear to buy data that includes location information, Mr. Wyden argued that internet metadata can also reveal sensitive things — like whether a person is visiting websites about counseling related to topics like suicide, substance abuse or sexual abuse, or other private matters, such as if someone is seeking mail-order abortion pills.</p><p>In his letter, he wrote that the action against X-Mode Social should be a warning to the intelligence community and asked that Ms. Haines “take action to ensure that U.S. intelligence agencies only purchase data on Americans that has been obtained in a lawful manner.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>22</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>In Letter, Security Agency Says It Buys Online Data Of Citizens From Brokers<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
