      <p>“Hey, Koala”, Turtle said, quietly, to the fur ball on his back.
Koala’s ears perked up, but she didn’t move, not wanting to wake the two
sleeping creatures in her arms, both flailing their arms in random
intervals to check that she was still there.</p>
<p>Turtle continued floating downstream calmly, focused on keeping his
passengers warm and dry. He took his time to continue his thought. “Are
you excited to come back home?”</p>
<p>Koala’s ears perked up more. She considered for a moment. “Very
much”, she whispered, “I’ve been ready to return for a while now.”</p>
<p>Turtle nodded slowly, making sure not to dip below the waterline. “Me
too”, he said. “I missed home.”</p>
<p>Koala padded his shell gently. “I know. But you did a much better job
this time.” She paused. “We did a much better job.” There was a question
in there somewhere.</p>
<p>“We did”, Turtle conceded. “I had a lot of fun with all of our
friends.”</p>
<p>“Me too”, Koala said, and her voice sounded so full of love that
Turtle wiggled his tail instinctively. “We saw a lot of my favorite
creatures. But now”, she pressed her nose into Turtle’s shell gently,
“now I’m happy to be coming back home and spend all my time with my very
favorite ones.”</p>
<p>Turtle sighed contentedly, and continued making his way slowly down
the stream, gliding by trees and meadows and sandy inlets, his heart
pulling him along on his way back home.</p>
