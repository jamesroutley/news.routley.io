    <h1>Google: Turn off VoLTE, Wi-Fi calling: severe Exynos modem vulnerabilities</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>Google’s Project Zero team <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2023/03/multiple-internet-to-baseband-remote-rce.html">discovered</a> severe 0-day vulnerabilities with the Samsung Exynos modems used on the Pixel 6 and 7, Samsung phones and wearables, and other devices that warrant disabling VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling until patched.</p>

<h2 id="h-exynos-modem-vulnerabilities">Exynos modem vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>Known for finding 0-days, Project Zero reported 18 vulnerabilities in Exynos modems in late 2022 and early 2023. Four of the vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-24033, involve internet-to-baseband remote code execution (emphasis ours):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tests conducted by Project Zero confirm that those four vulnerabilities allow an attacker to remotely compromise a phone at the baseband level <strong>with no user interaction, and require only that the attacker know the victim’s phone number</strong>. With limited additional research and development, we believe that skilled attackers would be able to <strong>quickly create an operational exploit to compromise affected devices silently and remotely</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the other 14 vulnerabilities are considered not as severe as they “require either a malicious mobile network operator or an attacker with local access to the device.”</p>
<p>Project Zero is making a “policy exception to delay disclosure for the four vulnerabilities that allow for internet-to-baseband remote code execution.” This is “due to a very rare combination of level of access these vulnerabilities provide and the speed with which we believe a reliable operational exploit could be crafted.”</p>
<h2 id="h-affected-devices">Affected devices </h2>
<p>According to Samsung Semiconductor (<a href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/support/quality-support/product-security-updates/">January 2023</a>), these are the affected chipsets: Exynos Modem 5123, Exynos Modem 5300, Exynos 980, Exynos 1080, and Exynos Auto T5123. Google compiled a list of likely affected products:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samsung Galaxy phones including those in the S22, M33, M13, M12, A71, A53, A33, A21, A13, A12, and A04 series</li>
<li>Vivo phones including those in the S16, S15, S6, X70, X60, and X30 series</li>
<li>Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, Pixel 6a, Pixel 7 and 7 Pro</li>
<li>Any wearables that use the Exynos W920 chipset</li>
<li>Any vehicles that use the Exynos Auto T5123 chipset</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/12/09/google-pixel-7-tensor-g2-signal-modem/">Pixel 6 (Exynos 5123) and 7 (Exynos 5300)</a>, this includes the S22, as well as the Galaxy Watch 4 and 5. On Pixel phones, the main CVE-2023-24033 vulnerability was fixed with the <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2023-03-01">March 2023 security patch</a> that <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/03/13/android-13-qpr2-pixel-feature-drop/">rolled out on Monday</a> but should have <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/03/06/march-google-pixel-update-late/">come a week earlier</a>. </p>
<h2 id="h-turn-off-volte-and-wi-fi-calling">Turn off VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling</h2>
<p>However, the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and 6a have yet to see that March update and are currently vulnerable. Project Zero’s advice for those impacted follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until security updates are available, users who wish to protect themselves from the baseband remote code execution vulnerabilities in Samsung’s Exynos chipsets can turn off Wi-Fi calling and Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) in their device settings. Turning off these settings will remove the exploitation risk of these vulnerabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>According to an older Sprint/T-Mobile <a href="https://www.sprint.com/en/shop/services/volte.html">support article</a>, “Google Pixel devices received software updates in 2021 that automatically enabled VoLTE and removed the toggle.” You can disable Wi-Fi calling on Pixel phones in Settings app &gt; Network &amp; internet &gt; SIMs &gt; Wi-Fi calling.</p>
