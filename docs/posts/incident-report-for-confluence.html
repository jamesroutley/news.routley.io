              A small number of Atlassian customers continue to experience service outages and are unable to access their sites. Our global engineering teams are working 24/7 to make progress on this incident. At this time, we have rebuilt functionality for over 35% of the users who are impacted by the service outage, with no reported data loss. The rebuild stage is particularly complex due to several steps that are required to validate sites and verify data. These steps require extra time, but are critical to ensuring the integrity of rebuilt sites. We apologize for the length and severity of this incident and have taken steps to avoid a recurrence in the future.

              We continue to work on partial restoration to a cohort of customers. The plan to take a controlled and hands-on approach as we gather feedback from customers to ensure the integrity of this first round of restorations remains the same from our last update.

              We are beginning partial restoration to a cohort of customers. The early stages of this process will be controlled and hands-on, as we work with customers live to get feedback and ensure that restoration is working well before we accelerate the process for the next cohort. We will continue to post updates here as we move along this process.

              We are continuing work in the verification stage on a subset of instances. Once reenabled, support will update accounts via opened incident tickets. Restoration of customer sites remains our first priority and we are coordinating with teams globally to ensure that work continues 24/7 until all instances are restored.

              We are continuing to move through the various stages for restoration. The team is currently in the verification stage on a subset of instances. Successful verification will then allow us to move to reenabling those sites. Once reenabled, support will update accounts via opened incident tickets. Our efforts will continue 24x7 through this process until all instances are restored.
