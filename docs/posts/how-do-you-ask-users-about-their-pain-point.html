    <h1>Ask HN: How do you ask users about their pain point?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m interested in the healthcare/medical space and trying to find a worthy problem to work on. I&#39;m applying the YC method of asking as many doctors as possible what their pain point is.</p><p>It&#39;s not going well. Just scraping LinkedIn and trying to make connections, I&#39;m getting a 25% connection rate and a 1% interview rate.</p><p>My message is super concise and trying to be as non-salesy as possible. I&#39;m pretty clear I&#39;m just looking to learn/listen and not pitch.</p><p>BTW I&#39;m also looking into other avenues than LinkedIn, just not 100% sure what that may be.</p><p>So, startup folks, how did you manage to land these early discovery interviews? Especially those in the healthcare sector.</p></div></div></div>
