So far, it has been studied only in mice, but if the compound works in humans, “it could help us dramatically”, says Sebastian Hiller, a structural biologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland who was not involved in the research. However, there is a caveat, he says: the compound’s usefulness “depends on whether bacteria will develop resistance to it in the long run”.</p><p>The study appears today in <i>Nature</i>.</p><h2>Small but deadly</h2><p>Gram-negative bacteria include public-health villains such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03668-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03668-0" data-track-category="body text link"><i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i></a>.

As a result, there are almost no antibiotics that specifically target Gram-negative bacteria. The few drugs that do also wreak havoc with the gut microbiome, allowing potentially deadly pathogens such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02487-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02487-7" data-track-category="body text link"><i>Clostridioides difficile</i></a> to take over.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>To find a way around the bacteria’s defences, the study’s authors started with compounds that don’t kill the bacteria but are known to inhibit the ‘Lol system’, a group of proteins that is exclusive to Gram-negative bacteria. Tinkering with those compounds produced one that the researchers called lolamicin, which “selectively kills pathogenic bacteria over non-pathogenic bacteria based on differences in Lol proteins between these bacteria”, says study co-author Paul Hergenrother, a chemist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p><p>Lolamicin had anti-microbial effects against more than 130 multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria growing in laboratory dishes. Mice that developed blood stream infections after exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria all survived after being given lolamicin, whereas 87% of those that didn’t receive the compound died within three days.</p><p>The team also found that common antibiotics such as amoxicillin severely disrupted the animals’ gut microbiome, which led to infections with <i>C. difficile</i>. By contrast, lolamicin treatment did not cause observable changes in the gut microbiome and spared mice from <i>C. difficile</i> infection.</p><h2>‘A long road’</h2><p>Gitai says that the study “proves the viability” of targeting the Lol system, but adds, “There is a long road from showing efficacy in mice to developing a drug for human use.”</p><p>Hiller also sounds a cautious note. The time from an antibiotic’s discovery to its approval for clinical use can be more than two decades, “and there is not much money to be made with a novel antibiotic”, he says. “Around ten to twenty new Gram-negative antibiotics have been discovered in the last ten years”, he adds, but none has gained approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>
