    <h1>AWS Code Commit Ceased Onboarding New Customers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Beginning on 06 June 2024, AWS CodeCommit ceased onboarding new customers. Going forward, only customers who have an existing repository in AWS CodeCommit will be able to create additional repositories.</p>
<p>This change should not impact your current workloads utilizing AWS CodeCommit. If you this is impacting your current workloads, please let us know. If you would like to use AWS CodeCommit in a new AWS account that is part of your AWS Organization, please let us know so that we can evaluate the request for allowlisting the new account. If you would like to use an alternative to AWS CodeCommit given this news, we recommend using GitLab, GitHub, or another third party source provider of your choice. We have written a blog  which describes how to migrate your repository to one of these other solutions.</p>
<p>AWS continues to invest in security, availability, and performance improvements for AWS CodeCommit. You can rely on AWS Support to continue assisting you with any questions you may have about AWS CodeCommit. However, we do not plan to introduce new features to AWS CodeCommit, except for security and availability updates.</p>
