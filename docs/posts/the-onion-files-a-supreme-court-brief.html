He has sought help from an unlikely source, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Monday.</p><p>“Americans can be put in jail for poking fun at the government?” the brief asked. “This was a surprise to America’s Finest News Source and an uncomfortable learning experience for its editorial team.”</p><p>The source is, of course, The Onion.</p><p>Or, as the satirical website described itself <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-293/242292/20221003125252896_35295545_1-22.10.03%20-%20Novak-Parma%20-%20Onion%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in the brief,</a> “the single most powerful and influential organization in human history.”</p><p>The Parma, Ohio, area man in question, Anthony Novak, spent four days in jail over a Facebook page he created in 2016 that mocked his local police department. He was charged with using a computer to disrupt police functions, but a jury found him not guilty.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Novak says his civil rights were violated, and he is trying to sue the city for damages. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit earlier this year, saying that the police had qualified immunity, and an appeals court upheld that decision. Now the high court is reviewing <a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Petition-for-Writ-of-Certiorari-Novak-v.-Parma-FINAL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his request</a> to take up the matter.</p><p>One of Mr. Novak’s lawyers, Patrick Jaicomo, said in an interview Monday that last month he contacted Jordan LaFlure, the managing editor of The Onion, which is based in Chicago, to make him aware of the case and see if he would be interested in helping raise attention.</p><p>“They heard the story, and they were like, ‘Oh my god, this is something that could really put all of our people in the cross hairs if we rub someone the wrong way with one of our stories,’” Mr. Jaicomo said.</p><div><section role="complementary" aria-label="Understand the Supreme Court’s New Term"><p><h2>Understand the Supreme Court’s New Term</h2></p><div id="storyline-context-container" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><p><span>Card 1 of 6</span></p><div data-scrolled-index="0"><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><p><strong>Affirmative action.<!-- --> </strong><span>The marquee cases of the new term are challenges to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/24/us/politics/supreme-court-affirmative-action-harvard-unc.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-scotus&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc">race-conscious admissions programs</a> at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. While the court has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/us/politics/supreme-court-affirmative-action-university-of-texas.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-scotus&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc">repeatedly upheld</a> affirmative-action programs, a six-justice conservative supermajority may put more than 40 years of precedents at risk.</span></p></div></div></div><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><p><strong>Discrimination against gay couples.<!-- --> </strong><span>The justices will hear an appeal from a web designer who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/us/colorado-supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-scotus&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc">objects to providing services for same-sex marriages</a> in a case that pits claims of religious freedom against laws banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. The court last considered the issue in 2018 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/us/politics/supreme-court-sides-with-baker-who-turned-away-gay-couple.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-scotus&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc">in a similar dispute</a>, but failed to yield a definitive ruling.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><p>In a filing that read in places like one of its articles, The Onion laid out why it believes the authorities in Ohio had acted unconstitutionally, sprinkling in sincere arguments in defense of parody while riddling the rest of the text with moments of jest and hubris — claiming, for example, a readership of 4.3 trillion, and also boasting that it “owns and operates the majority of the world’s transoceanic shipping lanes.”</p><p>Chapter headings included: “Parody Functions By Tricking People Into Thinking That It Is Real” and “It Should Be Obvious That Parodists Cannot Be Prosecuted For Telling A Joke With A Straight Face.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>In page 15 of its 18-page filing, the brief accepted that “the reader’s attention is almost certainly wandering.”</p><p>“So here is a paragraph of gripping legal analysis to ensure that every jurist who reads this brief is appropriately impressed by the logic of its argument and the lucidity of its prose,” it says, before dishing out a series of phrases it said was for the “Latin dorks” in the federal judiciary: “<em>Bona vacantia. De bonis asportatis. Writ of certiorari.</em>”</p><p>Mr. Novak’s fake Facebook page for the police department was modeled after the real page, but it contained a satirical slogan: “We no crime.”</p><p>One post, according to The Onion, claimed that the department would ban city residents from feeding homeless people in “an attempt to have the homeless population eventually leave our City due to starvation.” Other posts joked about abortion and pedophilia. (The Onion argued that the “quality and taste of the parody is irrelevant.”)</p><p>The police, as well as some residents who called them to complain about the site, did not find the page funny, Mr. Jaicomo said.</p><p>On Tuesday, a lawyer representing Parma, Richard Rezie, said that the courts had dismissed Mr. Novak’s lawsuit as groundless and agreed that his rights had not been violated.</p><p>The judges “did not base their opinions on parody, freedom of speech, or the need for a disclaimer,” Mr. Rezie said, adding that Mr. Novak “went beyond mimicry” when he reproduced a police warning about his fake page, but claimed that the Parma site was the fake and his was the “official” page.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Falsely copying an official warning along with a claim to be the authentic Facebook page is not parody,” Mr. Rezie said, adding that Mr. Novak also deleted comments from readers who realized his page was fake.</p><p>In Mr. Jaicomo’s view, The Onion’s brief used parody itself to make the point that parody is important and protected speech.</p><p>“The Onion cannot stand idly by in the face of a ruling that threatens to disembowel a form of rhetoric that has existed for millennia, that is particularly potent in the realm of political debate, and that, purely incidentally, forms the basis of The Onion’s writers’ paychecks,” the brief said.</p><p>It pointed to The Onion’s history of blatantly ridiculous headlines: “<a href="https://www.theonion.com/fall-canceled-after-3-billion-seasons-1819569446" title="(opens new window)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fall Canceled After 3 Billion Seasons</a>.” “<a href="https://www.theonion.com/children-creepy-middle-aged-weirdos-swept-up-in-harry-1819566246" title="(opens new window)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Children, Creepy Middle-Aged Weirdos Swept Up in Harry Potter Craze</a>.” “<a href="https://www.theonion.com/kitten-thinks-of-nothing-but-murder-all-day-1819588260" title="(opens new window)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kitten Thinks of Nothing but Murder All Day</a>.” A footnote reads “See <a href="https://www.theonion.com/mar-a-lago-assistant-manager-wondering-if-anyone-coming-1819579801" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mar-a-Lago Assistant Manager Wondering if Anyone Coming to Collect Nuclear Briefcase from Lost and Found</a>, The Onion, Mar. 27, 2017.”</p><p>Sometimes, of course, discerning which headlines are parody is not always easy. It has become customary for people on social media to attach the disclaimer <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nottheonion&amp;src=typed_query" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#NotTheOnion </a>when a news item seems too strange to be true. (“Indeed, ‘Ohio Police Officers Arrest, Prosecute Man Who Made Fun of Them on Facebook’ might sound like a headline ripped from the front pages of The Onion,” the brief said.)</p><p>To prepare the filing, The Onion consulted lawyers in Grand Rapids, Mich., who had previously worked with Mr. Jaicomo. One of them, D. Andrew Portinga, said Monday that writers at The Onion had helped his team flesh out the text and legal citations with quips.</p><p>“One of the points they wanted to make is that if you’re a comedy writer, you can’t tell people you’re going to tell them a joke before you tell them a joke,” Mr. Portinga said.</p><p>The brief also said that the case posed a threat to The Onion’s business model.</p><p>“This was only the latest occasion on which the absurdity of actual events managed to eclipse what The Onion’s staff could make up,” it said. “Much more of this, and the front page of The Onion would be indistinguishable from The New York Times.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
