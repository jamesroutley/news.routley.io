    <h1>FedEx launches new e-commerce platform</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>FedEx <a href="https://newsroom.fedex.com/newsroom/global-english/fedex-announces-first-of-its-kind-data-driven-commerce-platform">announced</a> today that it will launch a new “data-driven commerce platform” this fall <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fedex.com%2Fen-us%2Fdigital-transformation.html">called fdx</a> that it says will give online merchants “end-to-end e-commerce solutions.” The company’s new platform is aimed at helping businesses manage their supply chain, sell to customers, and manage deliveries. </p><p>The company wrote in its announcement that fdx will combine existing FedEx commerce tools, like access to members of ShopRunner, an e-commerce marketplace FedEx <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/retailwire/2020/12/14/why-fedexs-shoprunner-deal-wont-help-much-with-its-amazon-problem/">acquired in 2020</a>, with features debuting in the fall like the ability to create a “custom post-purchase experience” so brands can give customers more accurate shipment information or use insight from FedEx’s shipment network data for order management.</p><p>Christina Meek, FedEx’s global relations manager, told <em>The Verge</em> in an email that FedEx isn’t in the marketplace business, and that it’s offering businesses “digital capabilities and insights” while they control their customer experience.</p><p>The new platform comes as the company competes in logistics with Amazon, a company FedEx has seen as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/18/fedex-now-calls-amazon-a-competitor.html">a threat to its business</a> for years. In 2019, FedEx <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656813/amazon-prime-fedex-express-delivery-logistics-network-contract-termination-usps-ups">declined to renew</a> a contract to fly Amazon cargo through FedEx Express. Later that year, Amazon <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2019/12/18/amazon-blocked-sellers-from-using-fedex-and-now-we-know-why/?sh=c009ae32da13">forbade its sellers from using FedEx</a> for Prime deliveries during the holidays, blaming declining performance — a ban it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065900/amazon-ban-fedex-ground-shipping-lifted-holiday-season">lifted the next year</a>. </p><p>FedEx has been losing ground to Amazon, as has UPS, so much so that Amazon <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/amazon-vans-outnumber-ups-fedex-750f3c04">made more home package deliveries</a> in the US in 2022 than either of them. That’s just a few years after the online retail giant built up a logistics operation that largely uses tightly controlled third-party contractors that Amazon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/18/23765330/amazon-delivery-drivers-union-teamsters">insists aren’t its employees</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Update January 14th, 2024, 3:43PM ET: </strong>Updated to add clarity.</em></p><p><em><strong>Update January 14th, 2024, 11:50PM ET: </strong>Updated with clarification on the tools FedEx is offering businesses and a statement from FedEx.</em></p></div></div></div>
