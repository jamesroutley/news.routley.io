    <h1>EFF and EU should respond to Google taking FairEmail off the Play store</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p><span><a href="https://social.network.europa.eu/@EU_Commission">@<span>EU_Commission</span></a></span> please do something about this. And <span><a href="https://mastodon.social/@eff">@<span>eff</span></a></span> please intervene and support the open-source developers who are victims of Google&#39;s abuses.</p><p><a href="https://social.platypush.tech/tags/FairEmail" rel="tag">#<span>FairEmail</span></a>, an open-source email client for <a href="https://social.platypush.tech/tags/Android" rel="tag">#<span>Android</span></a> that allows you to manage multiple accounts, has been taken down from the Play Store.</p><p>Even if its source code is freely available, and both the code and the app&#39;s activities have been inspected and audited before being submitted to F-Droid, Google keeps harassing the developer as it considers the app as &#34;spyware&#34;, but it refuses to provide ANY details about their findings, or inform the developer on what they are supposed to change to get the app approved again. An appeal request from the developer only resulted in an automatic response from Google.</p><p>The developer was advised to appeal to the EU, but (maybe rightfully) he said &#34;what&#39;s the point? it&#39;s going to take them five years anyway just to come with a decision, and in the meantime my app won&#39;t be distributed on the major Android channel, and I&#39;ll have no incentive to keep working on it&#34;. We, as open-source developers, should NOT end up in this situation. We should NOT have the feeling that the institutions are not protecting  us because they&#39;re just too slow to intervene or even to understand an issue.</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time that <a href="https://social.platypush.tech/tags/Google" rel="tag">#<span>Google</span></a> harasses open-source developers and gets away with it. Email clients alternative to Gmail, as well as any app that accesses what Google deems &#34;sensitive user data&#34; (including emails, calendar, fit data etc.) will now require an expensive (talking of at least $4500 a year) and intentionally cumbersome certification process, and such a certification needs to be renewed on a yearly basis: <a href="http://www.pmail.com/newsflash.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span>http://www.</span><span>pmail.com/newsflash.htm</span><span></span></a>. This will mean the end for most of the alternative apps that support Google services.</p><p>This isn&#39;t about users&#39; security. Most of these apps are open-source, owned by the community, and regularly audited by F-Droid - a store with far higher security standards than the Play Store.</p><p>This is just Google declaring their final war against those who dare to access their email, calendar or maps without using Google&#39;s apps. This is Google showing the middle finger to the world and saying &#34;the only way to interact with your email and calendar must be through my apps&#34;.</p><p>More and more open-source developers are being so discouraged by Google&#39;s efforts, requests for money and the Kafkaesque labyrinth that they&#39;ve set up for appeals that they are pulling their apps and services for good.</p><p>This shouldn&#39;t happen, and the EU has a duty to defend us against this evil corp, because we can&#39;t keep defending ourselves. Enough with all the talk about new EU unicorns: if the EU really wants to battle Google, they should do so by defending an enthusiastic community that is already building the alternatives - often without being paid a single dime, while being regularly harassed by big tech.</p><p><a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-5-0-fairemail-fully-featured-open-source-privacy-oriented-email-app.3824168/page-1087" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span>https://</span><span>forum.xda-developers.com/t/app</span><span>-5-0-fairemail-fully-featured-open-source-privacy-oriented-email-app.3824168/page-1087</span></a></p>
