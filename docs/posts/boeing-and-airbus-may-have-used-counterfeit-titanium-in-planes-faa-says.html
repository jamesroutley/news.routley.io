But the news also brings its fierce rival, France-headquartered Airbus, into the wider scrutiny the aviation industry is facing.</p><figure><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-06/240614-airbus-factory-mn-0915-8d5173.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240614-airbus-factory-mn-0915-8d5173.jpg 1x"/><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-06/240614-airbus-factory-mn-0915-8d5173.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240614-airbus-factory-mn-0915-8d5173.jpg 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240614-airbus-factory-mn-0915-8d5173.jpg" alt="A plane under construction at an Airbus assembly site" height="1667" width="2500"/></picture><figcaption data-testid="caption"><span data-testid="caption__container">An Airbus assembly site in Colomiers, France, in 2022. </span><span data-testid="caption__source">Valentine Chapuis / AFP via Getty Images file</span></figcaption></figure><p>Spirit Aerosystems, based in Wichita, Kansas, which raised the alarm on the titanium issue, said it acted fast to remove all the suspect titanium from the supply chain.</p><p>“This is about titanium that has entered the supply system via documents that have been counterfeited. When this was identified, all suspect parts were quarantined and removed from Spirit production,” the company said in a statement.</p><p>Spirit added that “more than 1,000 tests have been completed to confirm the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the affected material to ensure continued airworthiness.”</p><p>&#34;Boeing reported a voluntary disclosure to the FAA regarding procurement of material through a distributor who may have falsified or provided incorrect records,&#34; the FAA said in a statement confirming yet another investigation into Boeing.</p><p>&#34;Boeing issued a bulletin outlining ways suppliers should remain alert to the potential of falsified records,&#34; the statement added.</p><p>Airbus controls about 60% of the commercial airline market with Boeing taking the remaining 40% — the companies&#39; grip on the industry has been called a <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mje/2024/05/08/comacs-impact-on-the-future-of-the-airbus-boeing-duopoly/#:~:text=Boeing%20currently%20maintains%20a%2040.6,oversight%20bodies%20like%20the%20FAA." target="_blank">duopoly</a>. </p><p>Boeing said in an emailed statement: &#34;This industry-wide issue affects some shipments of titanium received by a limited set of suppliers, and tests performed to date have indicated that the correct titanium alloy was used.&#34;</p><p>Boeing added that it was &#34;removing any affected parts on airplanes prior to delivery. Our analysis shows the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely.&#34;</p><p>Airbus released a statement saying the company &#34;is aware of the situation.&#34; </p><p>&#34;Numerous tests have been performed on parts coming from the same source of supply,&#34; the statement said. &#34;They show that (aircraft) airworthiness remains intact.
