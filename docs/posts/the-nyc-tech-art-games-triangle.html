    <h1>The NYC tech art games triangle</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I’m regularly asked questions like:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey. I just moved to New York. I want to find cool people doing tech/art/games stuff.</p><p>Where should I go?</p></blockquote>
<p>The exact details vary. Sometimes someone is just visiting; sometimes someone is focused on tech, or on games. But my answer is always the same. Here it is.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 id="toc:the-techartgames-triangle">The tech/art/games triangle</h2>
<p>The way I see it, there’s a triangle with art, tech, and games on the points. And most places that I spend time at in New York exist somewhere on that triangle.</p>
<div><p><img alt="A triangle with art, tech, and games on the points." loading="lazy" width="2676" height="1840" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://eieio.games/images/game-and-tech-resources-in-new-york/triangle-no-items.png"/></p><p>the triangle</p></div>
<p>Please don’t read into my placement on this triangle too much. It is largely me trying to describe what the average person in each of these spaces is focusing on. I love all of these places! But I think it is clearly true that NYU’s Game Center is more focused on games than ITP (also a branch of NYU), even though I’ve brought my games to both of them.</p>
<p>This is also far from complete! I’m only including places that I have visited or interacted with in some capacity.</p>
<div><p><img alt="A triangle with art, tech, and games on the points. Tech-aligned items include fractal tech, south park commons, the recurse center, and hex house. art-aligned items include NYU ITP, society for poetic computation, and hex house. Game-aligned items include wonderville, NYU gamecenter, and GUMBO. Wordhack is located in the center and is aligned with all three." loading="lazy" width="2942" height="1991" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://eieio.games/images/game-and-tech-resources-in-new-york/triangle-with-items.png"/></p><p>I&#39;m so scared I forgot something important, sorry if I did</p></div>
<p>So there you go! Here’s a brief description of each item, grouped by the area I think the item is most aligned with.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 id="toc:tech">Tech</h2>
<h4 id="toc:recurse">Recurse</h4>
<p><a href="https://recurse.com">The Recurse Center</a> is a writers retreat, but for programming. I love it a lot - I’m at Recurse as I write this! You go there to write code in a self-directed way and become a better programmer; it’s a free 6 or 12 week program. I have improved at my craft a lot while there and met lots of cool people through it. Plenty of people at Recurse are focused on improving as programmers, but lots of folks are doing art or game aligned work while there!</p>
<p>For the most part you can’t visit Recurse until you <a href="https://www.recurse.com/apply">apply</a> and do a batch there, but it occasionally hosts <a href="https://www.recurse.com/events/localhost-january-2025-omcb">events that are open to the public</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this post there’s a good chance that you should apply to Recurse (do note that it’s a full-time commitment).</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="toc:spc">SPC</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.southparkcommons.com/">South Park Commons</a> is a community that aims to get founder-type people from “-1 to 0.” I haven’t gone through the program so I can’t really speak to what its like (although it seems neat). They semi-regularly host <a href="https://lu.ma/southparkcommons-events">public events</a> in the evenings. Some of the demos I’ve seen there are artsy or games-y, but I’d say they’re almost always tech-focused more than anything.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="toc:betaworks">Betaworks</h4>
<p><a href="https://https://www.betaworks.com/">Betaworks</a> is a startup accelerator with an attached coworking space that hosts lots of cool events. While the “startup accelerator” part of it is definitely tech-focused, the events that I’ve been to have been all over the place (in a good way) - from demos of funded companies to a <a href="https://lu.ma/rmbha83x">fun artsy demo night</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="toc:fractal-tech">Fractal Tech</h4>
<p><a href="https://linktr.ee/nyctech">Fractal Tech</a> is a coworking space / tech hub / coding bootcamp. They run <a href="https://lu.ma/nyc-tech">events and hackathons</a> and have a <a href="https://fractalbootcamp.com/">3-month coding bootcamp</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="toc:hex-house">Hex House</h4>
<p><a href="https://hexhouse.studio/">Hex House</a> is a big old warehouse in Williamsburg with a bunch of studios that house cool techy artsy projects. The project at Hex that I am the most familiar with is <a href="https://folk.computer/">folk computer</a>, which is very cool. If you see an event happening at Hex House (for example, a Folk Computer open night!) you should check it out!!</p>
<p>Also this might belong in the “art” category and not the tech category and I’ve mis-sorted it because I’m most familiar with the tech side of the space.</p>
<h2 id="toc:art">Art</h2>
<h4 id="toc:itp">ITP</h4>
<p><a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/itp/">ITP</a> bills itself as “the center for the recently possible” and is about as close as you can get to the meme “the intersection of art and technology.” It’s a school with a bunch of different programs - from a multi-year masters program (which several of my friends have attended) to a <a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/camp/2025/">3-week summer camp</a> which I attended and enjoyed in 2024!</p>
<p>I see ITP as a place that artsy people go to learn tech stuff and techy people go to learn art stuff. One particularly cool thing about ITP is how <em>physical</em> it is; I’d say the majority of the projects that I see at ITP shows have a hardware component.</p>
<p>ITP has <a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/itp/#events">lots of shows and events</a> and you should go check out some of the shows :)</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="toc:sfpc">SFPC</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://sfpc.study/">Society for Poetic Computation</a> is an experimental school with a focus on “art, code, hardware, and critical theory.” I’ve never gone to an SFPC class (although I know and really like some of their instructors) but my impression is that the classes are hyper-specific in a way that a typical university isn’t; you learn about, say, <a href="https://sfpc.study/sessions/fall-23/data-by-hand">Drawing Data by Hand</a> instead of “data visualization” broadly.</p>
<p>Maybe that impression is wrong! I haven’t taken a class!! Sorry Todd!!</p>
<p>SFPC occasionally hosts events; I’ve attended their “software for artists” day in the past and enjoyed it. I don’t know where to find their events page but they have a <a href="https://sfpc.study/newsletter">newsletter here</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="toc:games">Games</h2>
<h4 id="toc:nyu-gamecenter">NYU Gamecenter</h4>
<p><a href="https://gamecenter.nyu.edu/">NYU Gamecenter</a> is a school at NYU about…games! It’s got a masters program and an undergrand program as well as an <a href="https://gamecenter.nyu.edu/about/incubator/">incubator</a>; it’s in the same building as ITP (but on different floors. It’s a big building). The people I know who attended have had a good time there, and I quite like the various folks I know that teach there in some capacity.</p>
<p>Maybe more importantly for the purposes of this list, the gamecenter <a href="https://gamecenter.nyu.edu/events/">runs lots of events!</a> It has a weekly playtest during the schoolyear, lectures that are open to the public, and once a year it puts on a very neat event called <a href="https://gamecenter.nyu.edu/events/no-quarter/no-quarter-2024/">No Quarter</a> that you should check out.</p>
<p>The audience for the playtest at NYU definitely skews towards “other people making games,” which may or may not be what you want. You’ll definitely get playtesters who want to give advice! But I’ve found it to be a nice place to showcase work and meet folks, and it’s open to a variety of formats (videogames and board games both fit right in).</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="toc:wonderville">Wonderville</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/">Wonderville</a> is an indie arcade bar - that is, the arcade cabinets at Wonderville are made by people in the NYC games community and many of them are one of a kind. It’s a very very cool space that you should go check out.</p>
<p>It also has a <a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/events">whole bunch of great events</a>. Some of my favorites are a <a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/events/playtest-night-january-2025">monthly playtest</a> that’s great because you often get an audience of kinda-drunk people that didn’t realize there was a playtest, and a <a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/events/game-jam-february-2024">2 hour gamejam club</a> where you make a full game in 2 hours! I met my <a href="https://jontopielski.com/">first gamedev friend</a> at the 2-hour gamejam club :)</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="toc:boshis-place">Boshi’s Place</h4>
<p>I do not know that much about <a href="https://boshis.place/">Boshi’s Place</a>! I have only been there once, and their about page says “under construction.” But my impression is that it is a fun artsy gamesy collective of people that often put on <a href="https://boshis.place/events">fun events</a>. And I’m a fan of the people that I know who are at Boshi’s :)</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="toc:gumbo">GUMBO</h4>
<p><a href="https://gumbonyc.org/">GUMBO</a> is a gamedev coworking space in Dumbo (get it?). By day it is a lovely coworking space full of people working on games - either solo or for larger companies. The people there are really great (GUMBO friends, I’m so sorry I haven’t visited in several months I swear I will be back soon).</p>
<p>GUMBO also hosts <a href="https://gumbonyc.org/events">lots of events</a>. Plenty are open to the public; you might want to check out their show and tell series, their monthly playtests, or their open happy hour. Others are member-specific; you can <a href="https://gumbonyc.org/membership">send in an application</a> to join the space if you’re interested in those.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="toc:wordhack">Wordhack</h2>
<p>So I put this think called “Wordhack” right in the center of the triangle. Why is that?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://toddwords.com/wordhack/">Wordhack</a> is a monthly event at Wonderville that I think is as close as you can get to the synthesis of all of these things. Wordhack has two different components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few “featured” talks that are 15-20 minutes long and tend to focus on technology, the arts, silliness, and sometimes games. They’re hard to categorize, but if you’re reading this list I think you’d like them.</li>
<li>An “open mic” that is really an “open HDMI cord” where folks come up and show…anything (?). I sometimes show my games there or tell a cool story about something I’ve made.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some things I have seen on the Wordhack open mic:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Teenage Dirtbag” sung only using Magic the Gathering card titles</li>
<li><a href="https://www.couples.game/">couples.game</a></li>
<li><a href="https://websim.ai/">websim</a></li>
<li><a href="https://eieio.games/blog/talk-paper-scissors/">talk paper scissors</a> (this one was me)</li>
<li><a href="https://greg.technology/">greg technology</a> showing like 30 different projects in 5 minutes</li>
<li><a href="https://toddwords.com/">todd anderson</a> typing out a poem using a keyboard strapped around his neck while using an NBA Jam soundboard</li>
<li><a href="https://lav.io/notes/infinite-video-showcase/#:~:text=Mr.%20Beast%20Saying%20Increasingly%20Large%20Amounts%20of%20Money%2C%20by%20WTTDOTM%20(Morry%20Kolman)%2C%20Mr.%20Beast%20(Jimmy%20Donaldson)">Mr. Beast saying increasingly large amounts of money</a></li>
<li>so many more things this list is too long already sorry</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, the point is if you’re reading this post I think that you should go to wordhack. I will probably be there; I may be on the open mic; you should say hi.</p>
<h2 id="toc:a-few-notes">A few notes</h2>
<p>Here are a few quick things that I think you should know.</p>
<p>“Babycastles” used to be a space where people hosted games and events (and where Wordhack used to be hosted). It doesn’t exist anymore and I don’t really know much about the history. But if you see old comments about it online, maybe check whether the event they’re referencing is at Wonderville now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.verci.com/">Verci</a> is a coworking space and community that should probably be on this list, but I don’t know much about it. They did let my friends and I host a fun artsy salon last summer; that was cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brooklan.com/">Brooklan</a> is some kind of gaming cafe thing? I’ve only been once for a playtest. If you’re looking for more playtests you might want to check it out!</p>
<p><a href="https://playcrafting.com/">Playcrafting</a> is a gaming…thing? Community? Company? I don’t really understand what they do, to be honest. They put on a thing called “play NYC” that I went to once but I didn’t get too much out of it - I think conventions just aren’t really for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.are.na/">are.na</a> is an image-gathering website that is kinda like hipster pinterest. Lots of people in the “scene” here love it. I don’t really use it!</p>
<p>Also: the vast majority of the things I’ve listed are in Brooklyn. Do with that what you will.</p>
<h2 id="toc:wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>I’m positive that I’ve forgotten a place that is important to me on this list. I’m so sorry if I did.</p>
<p>Otherwise, uh, I hope this was helpful!</p></article></div>
