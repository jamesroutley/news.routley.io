<p>Pitching new ideas by prefacing them with quotes like “Data scientist: the sexiest job of the 21st century” <span>(Harvard Business Review <a href="#ref-sexy-job" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>
or “Data is the new oil” <span>(The Economist <a href="#ref-new-oil" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> has become such a cliché that any audience (in business and academia alike) will
collectively roll their eyes in exasperation. And for good reason. Likewise, we do not believe radiologists or lorry
drivers will be replaced by artificial intelligence and out of a job for the foreseeable future, and we are not alone in
realising the limits of machine learning <span>(The Economist <a href="#ref-ailimits" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Even so, it is difficult to understate the impact that machine learning is having on many aspects of our lives. It has
taken the pre-existing trends of using data and analytics (under the banner of “data mining”, “big data” and similar
buzzwords) to inform business decisions and drive scientific discovery, and made them ubiquitous. Machine learning
has combined the mathematical rigour of information theory and statistics, the computational aspects of computer
science and the goal-driven flexibility of optimisation theory, redefining how we work with data.</p>
<p>The flip side of trying to distil parts of so many different disciplines has been the clash between their respective
cultures, which has been well summarised by Leo Breiman in “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” <span>(Breiman <a href="#ref-two-cultures" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a><a href="#ref-two-cultures" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>. On
top of that, there is a tension between machine learning practice in the industry and academia: the latter strongly
values producing novel models and theoretical results, while the former is driven by the need to produce practical
results that have business value. With so many different perspectives, it is a wonder that a rough consensus on what
machine learning is has actually evolved! (Personally, our red line is conflating deep learning with machine learning.
There is life beyond deep neural networks!)</p>
<p>In this melting pot of ideas, we feel that software engineering has played a remarkably small role compared to other
disciplines. Machine learning, after all, is “a technique that allows computer systems to improve with experience and
data” <span>(Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville <a href="#ref-goodfellow" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. Therefore, there is a presumption that one will interact with a computer system, which in turn
happens by engineering a piece of software that communicates to the computer system what it is supposed to do. The
quality of this engineering is crucial in both academia and industry. In academia, software quality issues are one of
the underlying causes of the “reproducibility crisis” <span>(Nature <a href="#ref-repro1" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>; Tatman, VanderPlas, and Dane <a href="#ref-repro2" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. In industry, poor engineering leads to lower
practical and computational performance <span>(Kang et al. <a href="#ref-kenett-paper" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, to a quick accumulation of technical debt <span>(Sculley et al. <a href="#ref-hidden-debt" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> and
sometimes to catastrophic failures with costs in the millions <span>(.Seven <a href="#ref-knights-capital" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>; The Register <a href="#ref-twilio-breach" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>; VPNOverview <a href="#ref-switch-breach" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>; Sherman <a href="#ref-zillow" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>.
There is, of course, a sizeable body of accumulated wisdom on how to architect and write software in foundational books
like <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> <span>(Thomas and Hunt <a href="#ref-pragpro" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> and <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> <span>(Ousterhout <a href="#ref-philo" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. However, these books are
written with business software in mind, and we find that they do not capture or touch only tangentially on key practices
that go a long way towards successfully implementing and deploying machine learning models. Analysis of algorithms;
matching data and algorithms with appropriate hardware; embracing data as part of the software; testing and documenting
algorithms and their implementations; modularising and building pipelines; and, last but not least, naming variables.
From our experience in academia and in the industry, engineering software and teaching software engineering to students
and new staff alike, these topics are often not given the importance they deserve. We hope to convince the readers of
this book that the viability of any software that analyses data, whether you call it machine learning, data science or
business analytics, depends crucially on putting careful thought into these engineering practices. We do not aim to be
prescriptive: the individual practices that we discuss will be more or less relevant in different settings, and can be
implemented with a variety of software tools. On the contrary, we want our readers to think about what we wrote in the
context of their own experience and to figure out which parts apply and which do not!</p>
<p>The book starts with a brief introduction to machine learning and software engineering, to set out how we view them and
how we think that they should interact in practical applications. The remainder is structured in four parts, from
foundational to practical:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Foundations of Scientific Computing:</strong> covering key topics that are foundational for the <em>planning</em>, <em>analysis</em> and
<em>design</em> of machine learning software, such as: the trade-offs of using different hardware configurations; the
characteristics of different data types and of suitable data structures; and the analysis of algorithms to determine
their computational complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Best Practices for Machine Learning and Data Science:</strong> revisiting best practices in software engineering from the
point of view of a machine learning engineer, from <em>writing</em>, <em>troubleshooting</em> and <em>deploying code</em> to production
(that is, serving models) to <em>writing technical documentation</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Tools and Technologies:</strong> discussing <em>broad classes of tools</em> that shape how we think about what is feasible to do
with machine learning pipelines, with examples from the state of the art and the trade-offs they make.
</li>
<li><strong>A Case Study:</strong> putting the recommendations in the previous chapters into practice by <em>discussing and prototyping
a machine learning pipeline</em> for natural language understanding from the work of Lipizzi et al. <span>(Lipizzi et al. <a href="#ref-recommendations" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>All the material in this book, including the book itself, is available online at</p>

<p>and will be updated to fix assorted typos and code problems as they become known to us.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to thank all the people who supported us and made this book possible. First of all, our families
who put up with our long working hours. The colleagues who gave us feedback on early drafts of the book: Vincenzo
Manzoni, Fabio Stella and Ron Kenett. And, last but not least, our editor Randi Cohen who bore with us through the many
delays this book suffered during the Covid pandemic.</p>
