    <h1>WWDC25: macOS Tahoe Breaks Decades of Finder History</h1>

		<p>Something jumped out at me in the macOS Tahoe segment of the WWDC keynote today: the Finder icon is reversed.</p>
<p>You can see that in the image below. On the left is macOS Sequoia, and on the right is macOS Tahoe:</p>

<p>I know I am going to sound old and fussy, but Apple needs to roll this back.</p>
<h2>Some History</h2>
<p>The Finder logo has changed over the years, but the dark side has been on the left <em>forever</em>. Here it is on the boot screen on System 7.5.3, which shipped in 1996, an early version of the logo in color:</p>

<p>And in the About This Computer screen in Mac OS 8:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Finder-About-8-0.png" alt="Finder in 8.0"/></p>
<p>This same basic design survived the move to Mac OS X, as can be seen here in the Public Beta from 2000. The only real change was the addition of a little sheen to make it fit in better with the Aqua user interface:</p>

<p>Here you can see it in Mac OS X Panther which shipped three years later:</p>

<p>The Finder then transitioned to the Retina era in 2012 with OS X Lion:</p>

<p>The logo was updated with the redesign that was ushered in with OS X Yosemite in 2014, then tweaked again for macOS Big Sur in 2020:</p>

<h2>A Solution</h2>
<p>The Big Sur Finder icon has been with us ever since,<sup id="fnref-32553-fn-car"><a href="#fn-32553-fn-car" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup> and I hope Apple reverses course here. I understand that the new icon is meant to be in sync with <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/">the new Liquid Glass user interface</a>, but some things are just tradition.</p>
<p>For kicks, I ran the current Finder icon through Appleâ€™s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/icon-composer/">new Icon Composer app,</a> and I think it looks pretty good with Liquid Glass, even in the clear and tinted modes:</p>
