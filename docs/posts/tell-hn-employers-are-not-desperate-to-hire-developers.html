    <h1>Tell HN: Employers are not desperate to hire developers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m in the middle of a job search and wanted to share my impression after discussions like https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33563083.</p><p>I&#39;m an unemployed mid/senior-level developer in the U.S. with a mediocre but solid portfolio and passable social skills. I&#39;ve applied for many jobs at normal non-FAANG places, almost all of which were a decent match for my background, and employers don&#39;t seem desperate. Lots of no responses or form rejections, several places where I was rejected after either the initial or tech screen. I haven&#39;t gotten to the negotiation phase yet anywhere. When I asked, most seemed serious about hiring: they just got a new round of funding, there was a backlog of work, something, but still no hire. Also almost no response from external recruiters, and very little inbound LinkedIn messaging from anyone.</p><p>I&#39;m not complaining, it&#39;s just how the grind is. I&#39;m getting enough traction that I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a numbers game. But the employers are not desperate.</p><p>If you are a candidate without a golden resume or big network and need a job, then definitely don&#39;t get complacent because of HNers telling you that $100k-150k jobs are falling off trees. Put together a decent portfolio and then get those applications numbers up from day one. My personal goal is at least 100 applications before seriously considering pivoting to something else.</p></div></div></div>
