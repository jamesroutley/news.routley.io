This short writeup is to introduce a convenience script for anyone who wants to 
build arbitrary Linux kernels and bootable Debian images for testing, debugging,
or whatev. It&#39;s called easylkb and we will be maintaining it here:

<a href="https://github.com/deepseagirl/easylkb">https://github.com/deepseagirl/easylkb</a>

///: What are we trying to do?

Write a simple script to make Linux kernel debugging easier and more accessible.

When you&#39;re building the kernel, there are only a few steps you need to do:

- Download the kernel source
- Configure the kernel source with the options you want
- Compile the kernel

To run this kernel, you can build it into a Debian image that can be booted
with qemu. We are adapting syzkaller&#39;s create-image.sh for this.

Once you run the kernel, you can debug it using gdb!

///: How do you install easylkb?

Install prerequisites:

  sudo apt install make gcc flex bison libncurses-dev libelf-dev libssl-dev
  sudo apt install debootstrap

Then clone the repo and run easylkb.py with Python

///: How do you use easylkb?

Build a specific mainline kernel version, use the -k option:

  $ easylkb -k 6.2

Build some other kernel in a directory, use the -p option:

  $ easylkb -p path/to/linux/

Command line flags are tied to specific parts of the build process.

To (d)ownload, (c)onfigure, and co(m)pile a kernel

  $ easylkb -k 6.2 -dcm

To build a Debian (i)mage from this kernel

  $ easylkb -k 6.2 -i

To (r)un the generated image:

  $ easylkb -k 6.2 -r

Combine all of these steps into one:

  $ easylkb -k 6.2 -a

Once this finishes, it will run the built image with qemu, and expose ssh and 
GDB debugging features accessible via localhost.

///: How Does It Work?

Under the hood this is how the script works:

- Download Linux kernel tarball from the kernel source repository on kernel.org
- Apply KConfig options that make it bootable with QEMU and debuggable with GDB
- Compile the kernel using make
- Create a bootable Debian image using create-image.sh

With the -r option, the script runs the bootable image using QEMU, with ssh and
remote debugging with gdb enabled.

///: How Do I Interact With The Image?

The image, keys, and run script are stored in the img/ directory within the 
kernel source.

You can ssh into your image like so:

  $ ssh root@localhost -p 10021 -i ~/kernel/linux-6.2/img/bullseye.id_rsa

The default login for the resulting image is the user &#34;root&#34; with no password.

This is an example ssh config entry for the resulting image, which you can 
add to your ~/.ssh/config file.

Host linux62
  HostName localhost
  User root
  Port 10021
  IdentityFile ~/kernel/linux-6.2/img/bullseye.id_rsa
  StrictHostKeyChecking no

Now you can ssh into your kernel by doing:

  $ ssh linux62

You can scp files by doing

  $ scp myfile.bin linux62:

You can use gdb to debug like this:

  $ gdb ./vmlinux some other args

///: Kernel Debugging

/!\ NOTE: If you are using kernel 5.18 or higher, you may need to add 
          `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_DWARF4=y` to the end of your kconfig! A 
          recent change affects what options enable kernel debugging.

To debug the kernel, you need $KERNEL_DIR/scripts/gdb/vmlinux-gdb.py

Add this to your ~/.gdbinit file if you want to debug this kernel, changing
the path to the kernel source you&#39;re working with.

add-auto-load-safe-path /home/user/kernel/linux-6.2/scripts/gdb/vmlinux-gdb.py

Now to debug just do

  $ cd /path/to/your/kernel/
  $ gdb ./vmlinux

Once you&#39;re in gdb just do this:

  (gdb) lx-symbols
  (gdb) target remote :1234

Wow! You&#39;re debugging the kernel you just built, pretty neat.

Try setting a breakpoint on load_elf_binary and then running &#34;whoami&#34; in the
running Linux image.

  (gdb) break load_elf_binary
  (gdb) continue

When the breakpoint is hit, inspect the bprm structure that represents the
binary program.

  (gdb) p *bprm

Then you can use the &#34;step&#34; command to step through the kernel&#39;s ELF loader!
