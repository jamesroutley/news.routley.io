      <div><p>In my previous <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/rc-w1d5-haskell">post</a>, I shared snippets from my RC application and how my plans have changed over the first week. This was inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/cindywu">Cindy Wu</a> sharing her own RC application, amusingly when she had trouble writing about RC.<br/></p><p>I share this sentiment. My Week 1 <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/rc-w1d5-think-clearly-from-first-principles">recap</a> from my first batch in Fall 2020:</p><blockquote><p>What can I say? Week 1 of RC has been a blast! It’s affirming seeing the diversity of backgrounds and knowledge. As a self-taught programmer, this week helped illuminate how the path towards mastery is not linear. It’s multi-dimensional.</p></blockquote><p>The prior recap, however, also had a quote by Paulo Coelho, a recording of Glenn Gould’s Goldberg Variations, the Jiro Dreams of Sushi trailer, and an FT Weekend article on the École Nationale d&#39;Administration moving from Paris to Alsace (now permanently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/world/europe/france-macron-ena-closing.html">closed</a>). These were snippets collected over the years, waiting to be shared with the world.</p><p>It’s true what Naval Ravikant says about <a href="https://tim.blog/2020/10/15/naval-transcript/">sequels</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Maybe the first run, they took an idea they’ve had for a decade or three decades and they expounded on it and it sounded great. And then in the sequel, whether it’s a book or a movie, they have to come up with something equally good, but they only have two years to do it. And it’s just really difficult to do.</p></blockquote></div>
