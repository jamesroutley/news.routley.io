<p>We have some really exciting news to share. Atlassian is acquiring Loom!</p>



<p>Loom is an asynchronous (async) video messaging tool that helps users communicate through instantly shareable videos. Today, almost 5 million Loom videos are created every month by their 200,000 passionate customers.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are over 1 billion knowledge workers looking for better ways to plan, track and execute work each day. The rise of distributed work has meant a greater reliance on tools to help teams work asynchronously, across different geographies and timezones.</p>



<p>This is where async video comes in, a tool increasingly sitting side-by-side other modes of communication like text, presentations, and spreadsheets. Loom’s leadership in async video combined with Atlassian’s deep understanding of team collaboration means we can bring innovation to the market and empower our customers to collaborate in richer, more human ways.</p>



<p>As Atlassian consolidates Loom into its platform, engineers will soon be able to visually log issues in Jira, leaders will use videos to connect with employees at scale, sales teams will send tailored video updates to clients, and HR teams will onboard new employees with personalized welcome videos. By integrating Atlassian’s and Loom’s investments in AI, customers will be able to seamlessly transition between video, transcripts, summaries, documents, and the workflows derived from them.</p>



<p>Loom will remain available as a standalone product, and once the acquisition is complete, we’ll be integrating it across our suite of tools so customers will be able to add context to the work they are doing everywhere. For customers looking to purchase Loom now, see <a href="https://www.loom.com/pricing">here</a>.</p>



<p>We are incredibly excited about the opportunity this presents for both Atlassian and Loom customers. Through the power of the Atlassian platform, we can create seamless experiences between every tool our customers use to get work done, with async video being the latest in the toolbelt to help unleash the potential of every team.</p>



<p>We can’t wait to welcome the entire Loom team to Atlassian, and with them create an even better work experience for every one of our customers.</p>
