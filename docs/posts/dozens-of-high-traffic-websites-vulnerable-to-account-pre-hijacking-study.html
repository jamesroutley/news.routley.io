After the victim signs up, the attacker takes advantage of security holes in the service’s authentication mechanisms to access or take ownership of the newly-created account.</p><p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10174" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10174.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> (PDF) found dozens of high-traffic services to be vulnerable to at least one type of pre-hijacking attack. The research sheds light on the security issues surrounding account creation, a seldom scrutinised issue.</p><h3>More than one way to pre-hijack an account</h3><p>The <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/research" target="_blank">research</a> was supported by one of the Identity Project Research Grants awarded by the MSRC in early 2020.</p><p>“In this project, we explored several topics, but soon noticed a pattern emerging around the ‘pre-hijacking’ threat model,” Andrew Paverd, a senior researcher at MSRC, and independent researcher Avinash Sudhodanan told <span>The Daily Swig</span>.</p><p>Account pre-hijacking assumes that the victim doesn’t yet have an account on the target service and the attacker knows the <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/email-security" target="_blank">email</a> and other basic details of the victim. The researchers discovered five types of pre-hijacking attack scenarios.</p><p>Some take advantage of multiple account creation modes supported by many online services. On many websites, users can directly provide an email address and <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/passwords" target="_blank">password</a> to create their account or use federated authentication by using a consumer-focused single sign-on (SSO) service, as provided by the likes of Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.</p><!-- Article End -->
