We started this service in 1998 as the first smart whois that would
automatically query the correct server(s) to get the data you need.
A lot has changed since then and it&#39;s time to move on. Most modern
command line clients on *nix-like systems will select the appropriate
whois server. Check your system&#39;s man page (&#34;man whois&#34; for those of
you who don&#39;t know what a man page is). If you prefer to use a browser
interface there are many sites that perform the same function and
they&#39;re easy to find with your favorite search engine.</p><p>

It&#39;s been a good run, and thanks for using this service over the
years.</p></div></div>
