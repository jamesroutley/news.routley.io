<h2>This is minimalist computing taken to the extreme!</h2> 
<p>
The new &#34;XS&#34; platform allows an even smaller computer design. Compared to the
original <a href="http://mynor.org/my4th.htm">My4TH computer board</a>, the new XS platform has a much
<a href="http://mynor.org/downloads/my4th-xs-light-microcode.zip">more compact microcode</a>.
I reduced the width of the microcode counter from 8 bits to 4 bits, so I could remove
one of the two 74HC161 counter ICs from the design. I also removed the two 74HC574 ICs
used for parallel I/O and the 74HC541 tri-state driver. The new
My4TH XS uses only 13.75 ICs! Why 13.75? Because a NOR gate in the 74HC02 remains
unused. So the My4TH XS computer consists of two memory ICs and only 11.75 logic ICs.
</p><p>
By the way, &#34;XS&#34; stands for extremely small in terms of mechanical size,
the number of logic gates or transistors used, and computing power.
That&#39;s why &#34;XS&#34; could also mean &#34;extremely slow&#34; ;-) .
Its speed is about 85% of that of the original My4TH when both are clocked at 8 MHz,
and 8 MHz is the highest frequency My4TH XS can run at.

In addition to the My4TH XS, I also built a more useful computer based on the XS platform.
I took the My4TH XS and added another IC (a 74HC74). With these two additional flip flops
I was able to add an I2C interface to the computer. I call this computer the
&#34;My4TH light&#34;, because it is a My4TH in a lighter version, and it also
has a light (a yellow LED) on the PCB!

Here is a size comparison between the three My4TH variants.
The <a href="http://mynor.org/my4th.htm">original My4TH board</a> is 100 x 100 mm, but the My4TH XS
is only 90 x 70 mm. This is only 39% of the size of a Eurocard!
