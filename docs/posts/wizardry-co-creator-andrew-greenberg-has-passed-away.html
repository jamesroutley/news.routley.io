<p>Released in 1981, Wizardry was one of the first RPGs for personal computers and would prove to be a huge influence on the development of the genre. It was also a massive success in Japan and continues to receive new installments in that market.</p>
<p>More recently, the original game was <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/09/games/switch-eshop/wizardry_proving_grounds_of_the_mad_overlord">remastered</a> by Digital Eclipse for modern systems.</p>

<p>Greenberg – who lent his name to the antagonist of the first Wizardry game (Werdna is Andrew spelt backwards) – would later work as a patent attorney and general counsel for a renewable energy company.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are with Greenberg&#39;s family and friends at this difficult time.</p>
