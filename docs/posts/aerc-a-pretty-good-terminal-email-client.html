  <h2>A pretty good email client</h2>
  <p>
    aerc is an email client that runs in your terminal. It&#39;s highly efficient
    and extensible, perfect for the discerning hacker. Check out the screencast
    above to get an idea of how it&#39;s used.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Notice</strong>: aerc is a work in progress. All of the features
    below are working, but expect to find bugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of its more interesting features include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Editing emails in an embedded terminal tmux-style, allowing you to check
      on incoming emails and reference other threads while you compose your
      replies
    </li>
    <li>
      Render HTML emails with an interactive terminal web browser, highlight
      patches with diffs, and browse with an embedded <code>less</code> session
    </li>
    <li>
      Vim-style keybindings and ex-command system, allowing for powerful
      automation at a single keystroke
    </li>
    <li>
      First-class support for <a href="https://git-send-email.io">working
        with git &amp; email</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Open a new tab with a terminal emulator and a shell running for easy
      access to nearby git repos for parallel work
    </li>
    <li>
      Support for multiple accounts, with support for IMAP, Maildir, SMTP, and
      sendmail transfer protocols
    </li>
    <li>
      Asynchronous IMAP support ensures the UI never gets locked up by a flaky
      network, as mutt often does
    </li>
    <li>
      Efficient network usage - aerc only downloads the information which is
      necessary to present the UI, making for a snappy and bandwidth-efficient
      experience
    </li>
    <li>
      100% free and open source software!
    </li>
  </ul>
