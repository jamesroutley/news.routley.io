    <h1>Delhi sizzles at 49C (120F) as heatwave sweeps India</h1>

Farmers say the unexpected temperature spikes have affected their wheat harvest, a development that could potentially <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61138859">have global consequences</a> given supply disruptions due to the Ukraine war. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The heat has also triggered an increase in power demand, leading to outages in many states and fears of a coal shortage.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Modi also flagged the increased risk of fires due to rising temperatures.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Summers have always been gruelling in many parts of India - especially in the northern and central regions. Even before air-conditioners and water coolers started selling in the millions, people had devised their own ways of coping with the heat - from keeping water cool in earthen jugs to rubbing raw mangoes on their bodies to ward off heat strokes.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But many experts say India is now recording more intense, frequent heatwaves that are also longer in duration.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, agrees that several atmospheric factors have led to the current heatwave. But adding to all that, he says, is global warming.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;That&#39;s the root cause for the increase in heatwaves,&#34; he says, adding that more research is needed to link climate change to other, less extreme weather fluctuations.   </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>D Sivananda Pai, director of the Institute for Climate Change Studies, points to other challenges apart from climate change - such as increasing population and the resulting strain on resources.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This, in turn, leads to factors that worsen the situation, such as deforestation and increasing use of transport. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;When you have more concrete roads and buildings, heat is trapped inside without being able to rise to the surface. This warms the air further,&#34; Mr Pai says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And the cost of such extreme weather events is disproportionately borne by the poor.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Poor people have fewer resources to cool down as well as fewer options to stay inside, away from the heat,&#34; says Dr Chandni Singh, senior researcher at Indian Institute for Human Settlements and a lead author at Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>While more attention is paid to mortality due to heatwaves, Ms Singh says policymakers should also focus on how extreme weather affects the quality of people&#39;s lives.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Heatwaves can have serious health consequences. If temperatures are high even at night, the body doesn&#39;t get a chance to recuperate, increasing the possibility of illnesses and higher medical bills,&#34; she says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A &#34;long-term vision&#34;, Mr Koll says, is essential when planning for the future.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;There are places in India where the temperature itself may not be that high, but when combined with high humidity, life can be very difficult,&#34; he says, referring to the need to take into account the wet-bulb temperature - a scientific measure of when heat and humidity combine.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Most Indians have no choice but to work with little protection against the heat</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He also emphasises on paying attention to areas away from the spotlight.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Many children in rural areas attend schools in sheds with tin roofs, which would be unbearable in the heat,&#34; he says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Since 2015, both the federal and state governments have issued a number of measures to mitigate the effects of heatwaves, such as banning working outside during the hottest hours and issuing timely advisories.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But these can only be completely effective if accompanied by big-picture changes such as an overhaul of labour laws and greening cities, Ms Singh says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Our buildings are made in such a way that they trap heat instead of ensuring ventilation. There is so much innovation internationally that we can learn from,&#34; she says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We are doing some things right but it&#39;s time to up our game - because we have to live with the heat.&#34;</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="You-may-also-be-interested-in"><span role="text">You may also be interested in:</span></h2></p><div data-component="media-block"><figure><div></div><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>India heatwave: Scorching temperatures affecting Indiaâ€™s poor the most</p></figcaption></figure></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
