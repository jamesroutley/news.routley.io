    <h1>VW is putting buttons back in cars</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks" id="incArticle"><p>Whether you&#39;ve driven a new <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/volkswagen-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Volkswagen</a> or not, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ve heard about its interiors. People who care about the German everyman brand have been extremely opinionated about the cars&#39; lack of physical buttons. Customers&#39; cries have even reached VW CEO Thomas Schäfer&#39;s ears, as <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/vw-ceo-admits-frustrating-golf-id-4-interiors-did-a-lot-of-damage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he said</a> the &#34;frustrating&#34; <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/vw-already-talking-about-dumping-touchscreen-controls-in-future-evs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">touchscreen controls</a> &#34;definitely did a lot of damage.&#34; Now, VW interior designer Darius Watola is reported as saying that the brand is going back to buttons on all new cars.</p><p>The news comes from <em>Autocar</em>, which quotes Watola as saying the ID.2All concept and its buttons &#34;showed a new approach for all models.&#34; Like Schäfer, he referenced the public&#39;s feedback. There are still touchscreens, to be sure—the infotainment display is large and in charge, and there&#39;s also a digital gauge cluster. But instead of all the controls being hidden behind menus in these displays, they&#39;re toggled via switches on the center stack.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"><div><div></div></div><span data-rawhtml="1">The ID.2All Concept still looks pretty sparse inside, but at least it has physical controls for the HVAC and all four windows. The production ID.4 can&#39;t even say that. <em>VW</em></span></figure><p>This is reassuring for the simple fact that actual buttons just work. The <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/vw-brings-back-steering-wheel-buttons-after-many-customers-complain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">touch sliders and whatnot</a> in the Mk8 Golf and ID.4 are finicky, only operating like they should some of the time. They also aren&#39;t backlit, making them difficult to find and use in the dark. Owners and professional critics alike have been tough on modern VWs for these exact reasons; <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/43809/2021-volkswagen-id-4-review-a-practical-ev-ruined-by-frustrating-tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my co-worker Jerry Perez went as far as saying</a> the ID.4&#39;s tech &#34;ruined&#34; what was an otherwise practical and livable EV.</p><p>Speaking on the car&#39;s infotainment, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/43809/2021-volkswagen-id-4-review-a-practical-ev-ruined-by-frustrating-tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jerry said</a>:</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s awful, likely the worst I&#39;ve ever come across. I was never able to find a channel list for the XM satellite radio because there isn&#39;t an option to do such a thing—at least not one you can find in under 30 minutes of poking around. Then there&#39;s a climate system on/off icon on the screen that you must click to turn the AC or heater on. You can&#39;t just push the fan speed icon and expect it to turn on. No, you must tap the &#34;on&#34; button and then adjust the temperature or fan speed separately. This extra step makes no sense—and to add insult to injury, I couldn&#39;t turn the heater on countless times because the climate portion of the OS was unresponsive. Other times, it would simply say that the function couldn&#39;t be performed at the time. Why? No idea.&#34;</p><p>As you can tell based on that blurb, actual buttons will be welcomed back with open arms.</p><p><em>Got a tip or question for the author?
