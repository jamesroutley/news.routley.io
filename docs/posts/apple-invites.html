                 <div><strong><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> </strong>Apple today introduced Apple Invites, a new app for iPhone that helps users create custom invitations to gather friends and family for any occasion. With Apple Invites, users can create and easily share invitations, RSVP, contribute to Shared Albums, and engage with Apple Music playlists. Starting today, users can download Apple Invites from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/invites/id6472498645" target="_blank">App Store</a>, or access it on the web through <a href="https://www.icloud.com/invites/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">icloud.com/invites</a>. iCloud+ subscribers can create invitations, and anyone can RSVP, regardless of whether they have an Apple Account or Apple device.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“With Apple Invites, an event comes to life from the moment the invitation is created, and users can share lasting memories even after they get together,” said Brent Chiu-Watson, Apple’s senior director of Worldwide Product Marketing for Apps and iCloud. “Apple Invites brings together capabilities our users already know and love across iPhone, iCloud, and Apple Music, making it easy to plan special events.”
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2><strong>Beautiful Invitations That Create and Capture Shared Moments</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>To get started with Apple Invites, users can choose an image from their photo library or from the app’s gallery of backgrounds — a curated collection of images representing different occasions and event themes. Integrations with Maps and Weather give guests directions to the event and the forecast for that day.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Additionally, participants can easily contribute photos and videos to a dedicated Shared Album within each invite to help preserve memories and relive the event. And collaborative playlists allow Apple Music subscribers to create a curated event soundtrack that guests can access right from Apple Invites.
