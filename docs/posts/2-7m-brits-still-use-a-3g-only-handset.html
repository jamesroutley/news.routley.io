        <p>A study carried out by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.opinium.com/">Opinium</a> on behalf of Uswitch, has revealed 2.7 million Britons (around 5% of mobile phone users) still use a 3G handset without 4G or 5G capabilities, despite the ongoing 3G switch off expected to be completed by 2024/2025.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the study also reveals 21% of those with a 3G handset aren’t willing to upgrade, and will simply continue to use their phone without internet connectivity.</p>
<p>However, calls and texts will continue to work despite the 3G switch off, as 2G won’t be fully switched off until 2033 the latest. This is because 2G is still used for critical infrastructure, including legacy connectivity solutions that typically have a longer product life. 3G, on the other hand, is generally used for data only, which can easily be replaced by 4G and <a href="https://schollz.com/phones/5g">5G</a>.</p>
<p>The results are particularly concerning as more and more people rely on mobile data as their primary internet connectivity, without a fixed broadband line at home. In addition, the number of those with a 3G only handset increases to 7% for those over 75. 32% of respondents say they are concerned for their elderly relatives, as they may be left without mobile phone access.</p>
<p>The survey also reveals 13% of people are unaware if their phone actually supports 4G or <a href="https://schollz.com/sim-only/5g">5G</a>, meaning the actual number of those with a 3G only handset may be higher than reported. This extends to 24% for people aged 75 and over.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, despite several PR campaigns by the major UK networks and increasing news coverage, 43% of the general public are unaware the 3G switch off is taking place.</p>
<p>EE, Three and Vodafone expect to completely switch off 3G access by the end of 2024, with O2 taking a little longer due to some of their smart home devices supporting 3G only.</p>
