    <h1>I learned Snobol and then wrote a toy Forth</h1>

<p>Here’s my conclusions about the Snobol4 language itself, which get their own
pages:</p>

<p>In short, I think Snobol is fascinating. The singular focus on pattern matching
kind of reminds me of Awk. Except Awk doesn’t do nearly as much with patterns,
it devolves into a C-like script to do things with pattern matches.  Snobol
uses no such crutches, just pattern matching statements for all logic and
control flow.  Its purity is impressive.</p>
<p>No kidding: <em>Every single line</em> in a Snobol program consists of five parts:
label, subject, pattern, replacement, goto. All of those parts are optional.</p>
<p>That certainly makes it a Weird Language to the modern developer, but once you
get the hang of it, it’s easy to see why Snobol was once popular and
well-regarded by computer users of all stripes.</p>
<p>It’s extremely easy for seasoned developers to forget that even a simple loop
construct is a conceptual leap for beginners. I remember being that beginner.
By contrast, I think conditional GOTO-style control flow is easy for beginners
to follow because you can &#34;see&#34; it. You can trace the logic with your finger.</p>
<p>Of course, simplicity of language is good for programming in the small, but
maybe not so good for programming in the large.  Snobol4 is basically
1960s-style &#34;unstructured programming&#34;, which is generally understood to
rapidly break down in large programs.</p>

<p>Still, Snobol proves that programming using &#34;this one weird trick&#34; can be surprisingly effective.</p>
