In the event that such redemption right was triggered, we would be required to issue a notice within five calendar days informing the holders of the notes of their redemption rights,&#34; Yandex said in a statement.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">&#34;The Yandex group as a whole does not currently have sufficient resources to redeem the notes in full.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">SUPPLY CONCERNS</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Yandex has avoided sanctions, but like all Russian companies it has suffered reputational damage. Lithuania asked tech companies to remove the app for Yandex&#39;s ride-hailing service from their stores this week. <a href="https://macwright.com/world/europe/lithuania-asks-google-apple-remove-yandex-ride-hailing-app-transport-ministry-2022-02-28/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">&#34;None of Yandex N.V., any of our subsidiaries, any of the members of our board of directors or management or any of our principal shareholders is a target of these sanctions,&#34; Yandex said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">However, the company said the suspension of supplies and services to Russia by a number of foreign companies could adversely affect some of its operations over time.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">&#34;We believe that our current data centre capacity and other technology critical to operations will allow us to operate normally for at least the next 12 to 18 months,&#34; it said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Companies ceasing shipments of consumer goods to Russia could also reduce its e-commerce offering, Yandex said. <a href="https://macwright.com/technology/russias-yandex-eyes-65-bln-annual-revenue-2022-after-fy-profit-slip-2022-02-15/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">The company said it is aware of speculation that the Russian government may try to take control of companies or assets in Russia in response to sanctions. Yandex competitor VK <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/VKCOq.L" target="_blank">(VKCOq.L)</a> became state-controlled late last year. </p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">&#34;Although we are not aware of any plans in this regard, the majority of our operations and assets are located in Russia and therefore any such action would have a material adverse impact on the value of the Yandex group as a whole.&#34;</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Reuters in Moscow
