    <h1>Racket branch of Chez Scheme merging with mainline Chez Scheme</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div jsname="yjbGtf" aria-labelledby="i4" role="region"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I have been working with long-term Chez Scheme maintainers to bring the <a href="https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1699355487878000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jdHutcVyNVmOoq8NeA7tI">https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme</a> and <a href="https://github.com/racket/ChezScheme" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://github.com/racket/ChezScheme&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1699355487878000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2fv8PZDjUk8n03MxfzXmEu">https://github.com/racket/ChezScheme</a> branches together. We are just about ready to merge! Merging will change the code in cisco/ChezScheme to v9.9.9-pre-release.20, which is a step toward a v10.0 release.<br/></p><p>After the merge, the content of the main branch at cisco/ChezScheme will be almost the same as the current content of the racket/ChezScheme branch. In other words, we&#39;re merging all of the racket/ChezScheme functionality to cisco/ChezScheme. We&#39;ve worked to ensure that the changes in racket/ChezScheme are not Racket-specific and that the changes preserve Chez Scheme&#39;s coherence, character, and quality.</p><p>By &#34;content&#34; of the branch being the same as racket/ChezScheme, I mean the content of a checkout using the most recent commit of cisco/ChezScheme after the merge, but the history from both branches will be preserved. Tip: Clone the cisco/ChezScheme repo with `git clone 
--filter=blob:none` to avoid eagerly downloading large boot files for 
older versions. (That&#39;s a useful approach already, even before the merge,
 and this tip will appear at the top of the new &#34;README&#34;.)<br/></p><p>The only substantial difference from the current racket/ChezScheme content is that the merged cisco/ChezScheme will not refer to a Git submodule for pb (portable bytecode) boot files. Instead, pb boot files will be part of the cisco/ChezScheme repo, continuing the way some platform-specific boot files have historically been checked into the cisco/ChezScheme.<br/></p></div></div>
