    <h1>Ask HN: How can we open-source a 7 year old SaaS codebase and build a community?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello HN! We’re currently open-sourcing our core code (backend and frontend) and pivoting to adding value with LLMs on top. With this, we need some advice.</p><p>I&#39;m Kirill Markin, and my co-founder is Nikolay Amiantov. We&#39;ve been working on our CRM/ERP product since 2017 and even have paying customers. But our growth is slow, and that&#39;s not exciting. We want to create something bigger for more people to use, and open-sourcing is something that both resonates with us and is a way to attract a community.</p><p>Our codebase is 38k LoC of F# (including a compiler for our own query language) and 35k LoC of TypeScript + Vue.js. While we prepare the code we have been reaching out to Zoho and ODOO integrators/developers (as they’re our closest competitors), from whom we got a lot of positive feedback.</p><p>Our biggest hurdle is figuring out the best way to take the next steps. Does anyone have any ideas on how to launch such a large codebase on GitHub to get maximum visibility? Suggestions on building a community around our open-source product, organizing further work, or any other pieces of advice are welcome.</p></div></div></div>
