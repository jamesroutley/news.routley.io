          <blockquote>
            <p>In 2011, I became curious about nicotine gum/patches as a possible alternative stimulant to <a href="https://jvns.ca/modafinil" id="gwern-modafinil" title="&#39;Modafinil&#39;, Gwern 2009">modafinil</a>: its much shorter half-life makes it more useful for evenings or scenarios like needing a quick alert on a long drive. I looked briefly into the nicotine/tobacco research to see whether there was convincing evidence that nicotine on its own, without any tobacco or smoke-related delivery mechanism, is either more harmful than most stimulants or likely to lead to severe addiction to tobacco as a ‘gateway drug’.</p>
            <p>The psychological effects of nicotine as a stimulant are long established by a scattershot literature, so there are possible benefits.</p>
            <p>Cost-wise, much of the nicotine/tobacco literature willfully conflates the two, leading to misleading attribution of the harm of tobacco to nicotine; many associations with harm are confounded by past or present tobacco use (eg. <a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/2020-kenkel.pdf" id="kenkel-et-al-2020" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="E-Cigarettes and Respiratory Disease: A Replication, Extension, and Future Directions"><span><span> <span>et al</span> <span>2020</span></span></span></a>), but when pure nicotine is examined, as in patch/GUM NRT, the harms appeared minimal: like all stimulants, nicotine may raise blood pressure somewhat, and is addictive to some degree, but the risks do not appear much more strikingly harmful than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#bodyContent">caffeine</a> or modafinil (and certainly appear less than the many commonly-used amphetamines). Animal experiments are, like usual, highly ambiguous, of low quality, and of doubtful relevance to humans. There is little evidence from the NRT literature that ‘never-smokers’ like myself are all that likely to become highly addicted, and minimal epidemiological evidence of harm from NRT use over the past 3 decades it has been available.</p>
            <p>‘Vaping’ is another story: few experiments have been done, and its popularity is recent enough that any harms are poorly understood other than it can’t possibly be remotely as harmful as tobacco smoking, and its delivery mechanism plausibly is much more addictive than gum/patch delivery would be.</p>
            <p>Overall, I am personally comfortable using nicotine gum (but not vaping) once in a while, and have done so since 2011 without any noticeable problems or escalation in usage frequency.</p>

        <p>One of the reasons tobacco became so popular in the 1600s, along with tea &amp; coffee (for their caffeine), was that nicotine is a powerful stimulant. Obvious enough; it affects <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Central_nervous_system" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#bodyContent">tons of systems</a>. Less obvious is that nicotine has many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Medical" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#bodyContent">beneficial effects</a> (and these benefits may be related to <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/animal-smoking-studieshtml" data-link-icon="OB" data-link-icon-type="text">anomalous</a> <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/smoking-followuphtml" data-link-icon="OB" data-link-icon-type="text">smoking</a> <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/what-anti-smoking-evidencehtml" data-link-icon="OB" data-link-icon-type="text">results</a><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>); the infamous deadliness of smoking would seem to be almost solely from the smoke, not the nicotine. Even less obvious is that nicotine itself may not be especially addictive, and its addictiveness is genetically modulated<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. (If nicotine was all that was going on, why do smokers struggle so much with their transition to NRT en route to quitting entirely? And why do so many people use nicotine gum or patches occasionally for long periods without being addicted, or quitting easily?)</p>
        <p>All of the harm seems to stem from tobacco, and tobacco smoking in particular; this is not necessarily obvious because almost everyone casually conflates tobacco with nicotine (especially public education programs<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>), treating them as a single synonymous evil I dub “nicbacco”. When someone or something says that “nicotine” is harmful and you drill down to the original references for their claims, the references often turn out to actually be talking about tobacco rather than nicotine gums or patches<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Other methodological issues include comparing to current smokers rather than former smokers or failing to control for the subjects being the sort of people who would begin such a societally-disapproved activity like smoking; the studies typically aren’t designed properly even for showing an effect: you need a study which finds deficits in smokers but not in non-smokers <em>or</em> former smokers (eg. <a href="https://www.medlive.cn/uploadfile/2011/1013/20111013114126307.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Smoking-related prospective memory deficits in a real-world task"><span><span><span title="et al">Heffernan</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2011</span></span></span></a> or <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/414283" data-link-icon="JAMA" data-link-icon-type="text,sans,quad" title="Smoking History and Cognitive Function in Middle Age From the Whitehall II Study"><span><span><span title="et al">Sabia</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2008</span></span></span></a>/<a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/2012-sabia.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Impact of smoking on cognitive decline in early old age: the Whitehall II cohort study"><span><span><span title="et al">Sabia</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2012</span></span></span></a> although neither enables nicotine inferences since there was no nicotine-only control group). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_vaping_lung_illness_outbreak" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_vaping_lung_illness_outbreak#bodyContent">2019 United States outbreak of lung illness linked to vaping products</a> offers a case in point of this prejudice: despite every sign pointing to adulterants added to illegal THC/marijuana vaping fluids by fly-by-night operators rather than nicotine (such as the decades of nicotine vaping by millions of people not causing them to land overnight in hospital ICUs), the outbreak has been used as an excuse to ban <em>legal nicotine</em> vaping fluids instead—which is like banning aspirin as a response to the opiate crisis because they’re both used for pain relief and they both come in pill form, and some OD victims also used aspirin recently, so that makes them pretty much the same thing, right?</p>

But on the other hand, as Le Foll et al comment:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Surprisingly, reinforcing effects of nicotine alone have often been difficult to demonstrate directly in controlled laboratory studies with both animals and humans as experimental subjects. Consequently, there has been continuing controversy in the literature about the validity of previous findings of reinforcing effects of nicotine in experimental animals and human subjects <a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/1992-robinson.pdf" id="robinson-pritchard-1992" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;The Role of Nicotine in Tobacco Use&#39;, Robinson &amp; Pritchard 1992">[3]</a>, <a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/1992-west.pdf" id="west-1992" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Nicotine addiction: a re-analysis of the arguments&#39;, West 1992">[4]</a>, <a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/2002-dar.pdf" id="dar-frenk-2002" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Nicotine Self-Administration in Animals: A Reevaluation&#39;, Dar &amp; Frenk 2002">[5]</a>, <a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/2004-dar.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Do smokers self-administer pure nicotine?

          <p>Or “Brain science, addiction and drugs” 2008:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The results showed that 40% of smokers receiving the [anti-nicotine] vaccine gave up smoking for nearly six months of follow-up; the highest smoking cessation rate (57%) was associated with the highest antibody response. These results are better than those seen in most nicotine replacement trials, but it is interesting that an unusually high proportion (31%) of the smokers receiving placebo also quit smoking for up to six months [Holman J (2005). “Helping patients kick the habit”. American Diabetes Association, DOC News 2, 1-2].</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>My take away is that there is addiction but it’s drastically overestimated by almost everyone and may been conflated with the habit-formation capability; the latter makes nicotine doubly valuable, but the former means we will want to be more careful with the nicotine than with modafinil or caffeine, where the main consequence of carelessness is tolerance rendering the stimulant useless or messing up our sleep for a few days.</p>
          <p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus#Health_effects" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus#bodyContent">snus</a>, a sort of chewing tobacco, has been studied extensively in Sweden where it is very popular and has been credited with large reductions in the smoking rate<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, and with little hard evidence of harm from snus use<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. Smokeless tobacco in general is hugely more safe than smoking (<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/nov/12/20051112-102753-2328r/">“Smokeout: Not as easy as ABC”</a>, <em>Washington Times</em>):</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Modern smokeless tobacco products contain nicotine in addictive doses to satisfy smokers’ cravings. University research has documented that smokers who switch to smokeless tobacco reduce their risk for all smoking-related illnesses, including oral cancer. On average, smokers live 8 years less than those who never used tobacco; smokeless users lose just 15 days. Statistically, smokeless users have about the same risk of dying as automobile users.</p>

            <p>“People are unreasonably afraid of nicotine”, Dr. Shiffman said. “The majority of smokers believe that nicotine causes cancer and is a big player in the harm caused by cigarettes.” In fact, carbon monoxide, tar and the countless toxic particles in cigarette smoke are what promote illness. Although smokers may become dependent on nicotine, it does not appear to raise the risk of cancer, lung disease or heart disease. Early reports that people who smoked cigarettes while wearing a patch stood an increased risk of heart attack proved unfounded years ago.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Dr. Siegel, whose graduate school manuscripts Dr. Glantz used to read, says e-cigarette pessimists are stuck on the idea that anything that looks like smoking is bad. “They are so blinded by this ideology that they are not able to see e-cigarettes objectively,” he said. Dr. Glantz disagrees. “E-cigarettes seem like a good idea,” he said, “but they aren’t.”…Public health experts like to say that people smoke for the nicotine but die from the tar. And the reason e-cigarettes have caused such a stir is that they take the deadly tar out of the equation while offering the nicotine fix and the sensation of smoking. For all that is unknown about the new devices - they have been on the American market for only seven years - most researchers agree that puffing on one is far less harmful than smoking a traditional cigarette…E-cigarette skeptics have also raised concerns about nicotine addiction. But many researchers say that the nicotine by itself is not a serious health hazard. Nicotine-replacement therapies like lozenges and patches have been used for years. Some even argue that nicotine is a lot like caffeine: an addictive substance that stimulates the mind. “Nicotine may have some adverse health effects, but they are relatively minor,” said Dr. Neal L. Benowitz, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who has spent his career studying the pharmacology of nicotine…“Part of the furniture for us is that the tobacco industry is evil and everything they do has to be opposed,” said John Britton, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham in England, and the director for the U.K. Center for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies. “But one doesn’t want that to get in the way of public health.”</p>

          <p>Which would seem to suggest the following line of thought: if the research on actual smoking is equivocal, and then the demonstrated harm of non-smoking tobacco is so minimal (even if we ignore equivocalness), then how much safer would be just nicotine on its own as a patch/pill?

                  <blockquote>
                    <p><span>Dozens of studies have assessed the effects of nicotine on cognition in healthy, nicotine-naïve samples including studies of memory (<span><span title="et al">McClernon</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2003</span></span>), attention (<span><span title="et al">Froeliger</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2009</span></span>) and inhibitory control (Potter and Newhouse, 2004). In a recent meta-analysis of 48 studies in which nicotine was administered to non-smokers or only minimally deprived smokers (<span><span title="et al">Heishman</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2010</span></span>), nicotine was shown to have positive effects on multiple domains including attention and working memory. Twenty-nine studies specifically assessed non-smokers and among those, positive effects were observed for reaction time on tests of sustained (or alerting) attention and working memory.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Studies of the effects of nicotine on inhibitory control were not included in the meta-analysis, but a handful of studies suggest potential positive effects of nicotine on this domain.

Moreover, nicotine has been shown to reduce CPT commission errors in nonsmokers with schizophrenia (<span><span title="et al">Barr</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2007</span></span>), non-smokers low in attentiveness (Poltavski and Petros, 2006); and decrease stop signal reaction time in adolescents nonsmokers with ADHD (Potter and Newhouse, 2004). Despite these findings, nicotine was not shown to improve response inhibition in adults with ADHD as measured with a CPT task (<span><span title="et al">Levin</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2001</span></span>).</span></p>

                <p>“Our brains normally make these associations between things that support our existence and environmental cues so that we conduct behaviors leading to successful lives. The brain sends a reward signal when we act in a way that contributes to our well being,” said Dr. John A. Dani, professor of neuroscience at BCM and co-author of the study. “However, nicotine commandeers this subconscious learning process in the brain so we begin to behave as though smoking is a positive action.” Dani said that environmental events linked with smoking can become cues that prompt the smoking urge. Those cues could include alcohol, a meal with friends, or even the drive home from work. To understand why these associations are so strong, Dani and Dr. Jianrong Tang, instructor of neuroscience at BCM and co-author of the report, decided to record brain activity of mice as they were exposed to nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco.</p>
                <p>…“The brain activity change was just amazing,” Dani said. “Compared to injections of saline, nicotine strengthened neuronal connections-sometimes up to 200 percent. This strengthening of connections underlies new memory formation.”…“We found that nicotine could strengthen neuronal synaptic connections only when the so called reward centers sent a dopamine signal. That was a critical process in creating the memory associations even with bad behavior like smoking.”</p>

                <p>I have had success working around ‘Ugh’ reactions to various activities. I took the direct approach. I (intermittently) use nicotine lozenges as a stimulant while exercising. Apart from boosting physical performance and motivation it also happens to be the most potent substance I am aware of for increasing habit formation in the brain…</p>
                <p>And I do use nicotine for studying at times (usually patches that I have cut into the desired dose). Partly for learning mental habits and partly for enhanced focus and motivation without the agitation that comes (with methamphetamine (at least, for me)). Again, I don’t swear by it but it works…<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
                <p>I have never smoked a cigarette. Nor have I ever had a remote tendency towards addiction to any substance. That is even one of the reasons I gave when describing why this is an effective technique for me personally. I am more at risk of becoming addicted to discussing substances on the Internet than the substances themselves….</p>
                <p>I should note that the role nicotine lozenges are taking here is not primarily as a training reward, like giving the rat electronically stimulated orgasms when it presses the lever. Nicotine isn’t particularly strong in that role compared to alternatives (such as abusing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate#bodyContent">Ritalin</a>), at least when it is not administered by a massive hit straight into the brain via the lungs. No, the particular potency of nicotine is that it potentates the formation of habits for activities undertaken while under the influence by means more fundamental than a ‘mere’ stimulus-reward mechanism. Habits that are found to be harder to extinct than an impulse to take a drug. This is what makes smoking so notoriously hard to quit even with patches and makes the use of fake cigarettes to suck on useful.<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

            <p>The price is not an issue. Nicotine in the US is not as expensive as one might intuitively guess from sky-high cigarette prices &amp; widespread tobacco smuggling; perhaps due to the intrinsic low cost of nicotine or because it is politically unpalatable to tax products which are largely used by people quitting smoking, prices for a 2mg dose of nicotine is easily in the 15-20 cents range:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>2mg may be too much for a non-smoker like me, in which case prices per dose drop further. Nor have I looked hard<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> for low prices; just grabbed random hits on Amazon. You could probably drive it down to the 5-10 cents range with canny shopping and buying in bulk (nicotine is an insecticide, not a perishable foodstuff, so you could buy years’ worth - just like with <a href="https://jvns.ca/melatonin" id="gwern-melatonin" title="&#39;Melatonin&#39;, Gwern 2008">melatonin</a>). One difficulty with gum, however, is that it’s hard to subdivide: nicotine evaporates from gum and so cutting up a 4mg piece of gum into 4 1mg pieces forces you to either use them all within a few hours, waste some pieces, or store them in some sort of air-tight wrapper for later use.</p>
            <p>Further, the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette#bodyContent">e-cigarettes</a> which use nicotine dissolved in water means that if you are willing to have the nicotine absorbed quickly (which would seem to slightly increase addiction risks), the price for a 2mg dose plummets even further; consider <a href="https://www.nicvape.com/store/p/48-1-liter-of-100-mg-ml.aspx">one liter</a> of fluid for e-cigarettes (<span data-year-original="2012" data-amount-original="232" data-year-current="2023" data-amount-current="306.11" title="CPI inflation-adjusted US dollar: from nominal $232 in 2012 → real $306.11 in 2023">$306.11<span><sup>$232</sup><sub>2012</sub></span></span> as of 2012, but down to <span data-year-original="2013" data-amount-original="160" data-year-current="2023" data-amount-current="207.99" title="CPI inflation-adjusted US dollar: from nominal $160 in 2013 → real $207.99 in 2023">$207.99<span><sup>$160</sup><sub>2013</sub></span></span> as of October 2013).

                <p>You could become addicted despite everything. Hypothetically, this could then lead to tobacco use with all the attendant ills.</p>
                <p>This is a truly subjective one. Former smokers probably should not be monkeying about with nicotine. Some people are scared this might happen; others aren’t worried at all. Given what I’ve read about nicotine not being addictive but strengthening habits (see previous quotes from Wedrifid), I think this fear might be overblown.</p>

            <p>Nicotine gum or patch use seems to be extremely rare among people who have not previously smoked (“never smokers”), which makes it hard to judge the risk of developing dependence, or the risk of developing dependence and then moving on to tobacco.</p>
            <p>An example of the rarity comes from <a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/2008-gerlach.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Use of nicotine replacement therapy among never smokers in the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys"><span><span><span title="et al">Gerlach</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2008</span></span></span></a>: the authors examined a survey of <em>n</em> = 28,000; 8 never-smokers claimed use of nicotine-replacement therapy, but 6 self-reported tobacco use or had blood-levels too high or low - leaving just 2 (probably) valid examples.</p>

              <p>People who were addicted to the nicotine gum could easily find our questionnaire, because it was listed on top of the list in Google. In spite of this effective enrolment strategy, we identified only two never-users of tobacco among daily gum users, which suggests that NRT use in never-users of tobacco is a rare phenomenon. Similarly, a previous survey in people who responded to a newspaper ad that read: “Are you addicted to nicotine gum?” could not enrol any never smoker <a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/2004-hughes.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Misuse of and dependence on over-the-counter nicotine gum in a volunteer sample&#39;, Hughes et al 2004">[5]</a>.

In a previous survey, 0.3% of adolescent never smokers reported past daily use of NRT, but none was reported as being addicted to NRT [<a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/2003-klesges.pdf" id="klesges-et-al-2003" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Use of Nicotine Replacement Therapy in Adolescent Smokers and Nonsmokers&#39;, Klesges et al 2003">25</a>]. However, some adolescents will endorse using any product when a list is presented to them, eg. 0.4% said they used a fictitious nicotine “Nic-T” product [<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-7-159" data-link-icon="springerlink" data-link-icon-type="svg">26</a>]. In two surveys in the USA, 2.7% and 4.6% of school drug counsellors indicated that nicotine patches and gums were abused by adolescents, but these “NRT abusers” were mainly smokers who used NRT while smoking, and only 7% to 16% of these “NRT abusers” were never smokers [<a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/2005-hyland.pdf" id="hyland-et-al-2005" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Drug Counselor Report of Adolescents Abuse of Nicotine Replacement Therapy&#39;, Hyland et al 2006">27</a>]. The latter study did not report any case of NRT dependence in adolescent never smokers [27]. Similarly, studies in representative samples of the UK and Swedish general populations found no never-user of tobacco among users of NRT [<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-7-159#B28" data-link-icon="springerlink" data-link-icon-type="svg">28</a>]. A review of post-marketing surveillance data in the USA found no report of primary dependence to the nicotine gum and patch,[<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-7-159#B29" data-link-icon="springerlink" data-link-icon-type="svg">29</a>] and only 39 cases of dependence on the nicotine gum were reported per million prescriptions to smokers, in surveillance data [<a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/1996-spyker.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Post-marketing adverse events associated with the nicotine patch and polacrilex resin in the United States&#39;, Spyker et al 1996">30</a>]. Therefore, addiction to nicotine gum in never smokers is probably very rare. Furthermore, there may be few adverse consequences of being addicted to the nicotine gum, except for the financial cost and the inconvenience of permanent chewing. In particular, NRT products are safe even in patients with heart disease, [<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199612123352402" id="joseph-et-al-1996" data-link-icon="NEJM" data-link-icon-type="text,quad" title="&#39;The safety of transdermal nicotine as an aid to smoking cessation in patients with cardiac disease&#39;, Joseph et al 1996">31</a>,<a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/1997-mahmarian.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Nicotine Patch Therapy in Smoking Cessation Reduces the Extent of Exercise-Induced Myocardial Ischemia&#39;, Mahmarian et al 1997">32</a>] and there was no untoward effect of 5 years of nicotine gum use in the Lung Health Study [<a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/1996-murray.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Safety of nicotine polacrilex gum used by 3,094 participants in the Lung Health Study&#39;, Murray et al 1996">33</a>].

Thus, even if only 1% of users became dependent on the gum, this would still represent tens of thousands of people…Even though some users may be dependent on the gum, it must be emphasized that there is no known adverse consequence of long-term use of NRT, except for the financial cost, and that the potential benefits (ie. prevent late relapse) far outweigh the drawbacks. This is probably why dependence on the nicotine gum has been generally downplayed in the literature (<a href="https://www.hri.global/files/2011/07/13/West_-_Abuse_Liability_-_copyright_refused.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-archive="/doc/www/www.hri.global/b972f9499e9e5d8846a6c1d9e487d829eff52c5c.pdf" title="A comparison of the abuse liability and dependence potential of nicotine patch, gum, spray and inhaler"><span><span><span title="et al">West</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2000</span></span></span></a> [see also <a href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/14/1/49.full" data-link-icon="bmj" data-link-icon-type="text,tri,sans" title="A prospective study of off-label use of, abuse of, and dependence on nicotine inhaler"><span><span><span title="et al">Hughes</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2005</span></span></span></a>]).</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>About 35% of users reported becoming addicted, but this was heavily dependent upon variety of nicotine. Among users who smoked normal tobacco cigarettes, 65% reported addiction. Among those who smoked e-cigarettes, only 25% reported addiction (and again, since there’s no time data, it’s possible these people switched to e-cigarettes because they were addicted and not vice versa). Among users of nicotine gum and lozenges, only 7% reported addiction, and only 1% reported major addiction. Although cigarettes are a known gigantic health/addiction risk, the nootropic community’s use of isolated nicotine as a stimulant seems from this survey (subject to the above caveat) to be comparatively but not completely safe.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>One approach to estimating addictiveness of nicotine gum or patches is to borrow a strategy from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3611984/" id="fagerström-eissenberg-2012" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Dependence on Tobacco and Nicotine Products: a case for product-specific assessment"><span><span><span>Fagerstrom &amp; Eissenberg</span><span>2012</span></span></span></a> in looking at the success of various studies’ control groups (using nicotine gums or patches) in quitting during those studies:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The intention here was not to estimate the effect of the treatment but rather its placebo to determine how difficult it is to stop using a certain form of tobacco/nicotine product. Therefore, the success rate in the placebo group is used as indicators for difficulty abstaining. Table 2 shows that cigarette smokers, independent of treatment, show a success rate of roughly 10% with little variation (range 9.8-11.2). Those seeking to stop ST use have roughly more than double the success rate of cigarette smokers (range 19.1-33.0). In the study (<a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/2013-tonnesen.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Varenicline to Stop Long-term Nicotine Replacement Use: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial">Tønnesen &amp; Mikkelsen, 2012</a>), where 69 long-term users of pure nicotine mostly in the form of gum, in average seven years, a success rate of 36% was observed. Those who become long-term users of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are recognized as heavy dependent smokers (<a href="https://jvns.ca/doc/nicotine/1988-hajek.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Long-term use of nicotine chewing gum. Occurrence, determinants, and effect on weight gain">Hajek, Jackson, &amp; Belcher, 1988</a>), which also seemed to be true in this study. Their cigarette consumption before quitting was 24.5 per day and their recalled FTCD score from when they were smoking was a high 6.7. It can be hypothesized that this type of smoker would have had no better success rate in stopping than the 10% seen normally but when coming off long-term NRT, it was 36%. The 36% was obtained from a 1-year follow-up. Several of the smokeless studies reported success rates from 6 months. It is of interest to note that the authors excluded long-term patch users since it would have been unlikely to see a difference between active and placebo treatment due to the ease by which they normally can stop. Moreover, it is much more infrequent to observe long-term patch use (Shiffman, Hughes, Pillitteri, &amp; Burton, 2003). It seems as a patch is not very likely to be able to support a compulsive use pattern due to its little behavioral involvement and or pharmacokinetic nicotine uptake pattern. The data in Table 2 lead us to conclude that quitting cigarette smoking is more difficult than quitting ST (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2997603/" id="fagerström-et-al-2010" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Stopping smokeless tobacco with varenicline: randomized double blind placebo controlled trial">Fagerström, Gilljam, Metcalfe, Tonstad, &amp; Messig, 2010</a>) and, although there is only one study from the NR category, that quitting these products may be easiest (Tønnesen &amp; Mikkelsen, 2012).</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>What does this imply for any never-smoker (not predisposed to tobacco use) using nicotine gum/patches judiciously and self-monitoring for signs of dependence, well aware of the dangers of tobacco use? Given the lack of observations despite large datasets, the low rates of dependence in smokers, the ease of quitting nicotine gum, and so on, my personal opinion is that the risk of dependency should be much lower than the smoker risks of 1-20% and then the risk even lower of then progressing to tobacco use. (In considering cost-benefit, it’s worth remembering that tobacco use has been quit successfully by many millions despite the notorious difficulty, and that the health outcomes of quitters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation#Health_benefits" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation#bodyContent">gradually heal</a> to the baseline of non-smokers.)</p>

          <p>So what’s the upshot? My reading has convinced me to at least give it a try and it has been useful (see the nicotine section of <a href="https://jvns.ca/nootropic/nootropics#nicotine" id="gwern-nootropic-nootropics-nicotine">Nootropics</a>). The negatives universally seem to be long-term negatives, and even if nicotine turns out to be something I haul out only in a crisis or every few weeks, it would still have been worth investigating.</p>

Are they right? I don’t know. As deliciously contrarian as it would be to go around shocking people by seriously advocating tobacco use, it’s not a subject I’m interested in tackling. In philosophy, one is taught to not “try to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_too_much" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_too_much#bodyContent">prove too much</a>” (inviting people to <a href="https://jvns.ca/modus" id="gwern-modus" title="&#39;One Man’s Modus Ponens&#39;, Branwen 2012"><em>modus tollens</em> your <em>modus ponens</em></a>), to not do more philosophy than one <em>has</em> to; in programming, you learn to not become an “architecture astronaut” solving some hugely abstract version of your actual problem - such overreach invites disaster.</p>
          <p>It’s much easier for me to defend use of nicotine, so that’s all I try to do: nicotine is pretty much harmless, the studies are clear, the relevant areas &amp; studies comprehensible with not <em>too</em> much work, and I feel I can discuss it with a clean conscience. Really, about the worst you can say about pure nicotine use is that it might be a gateway to tobacco or that one’s blood pressure might increase, which are issues that can be easily addressed empirically via additional studies/surveys or by eg. measuring one’s own blood pressure after taking nicotine, respectively.</p>
          <p>But if I wanted to defend tobacco itself, I have abruptly expanded my task by <em>orders of magnitude</em>: now I need to deal with all the anti-smoking correlational studies, I need to defend an idiosyncratic interpretation of how the tobacco industry’s products have evolved over the last century, I need to defend not just nicotine but all the other substances in tobacco which might override its benefits, I need to explain why the nigh-universal consensus against tobacco is wrong and to give a historical account of how such an error could come into exist and then expand to be universal. This is an <em>incredible</em> amount of work; any one of these points represents more work than this entire article and plausibly more work than this entire site. One could (and men have) spent entire careers working on small parts of the puzzle just outlined.</p>
          <p>It’s also bad from the rhetorical point of view: defending tobacco requires me to engage in what looks like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer" data-link-icon="LW" data-link-icon-type="text" data-url-html="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer?format=preview&amp;theme=classic">partisan</a> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics" data-link-icon="LW" data-link-icon-type="text" data-url-html="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics?format=preview&amp;theme=classic">politics</a> &amp; revisionist history. It is challenging beliefs that are, rightly or wrongly, deeply entrenched. Many people have enough flexibility to think, even if a relative died horribly of lung cancer, that nicotine was only the addictive stimulating agent and the <em>real</em> killer was the smoke or the tar or something, and so are willing to consider that nicotine - on its own - might be useful. They are not willing to consider the whole package.</p>
          <p>You can see the difference in the tasks by comparing this one page to the multiple threads in Imminst alone with <em>scores</em> of pages in each. One is short and clear and easily evaluated on its own terms (I hope), and has met with neutral or positive reactions from everyone I’ve asked to read it; the other comes off as a crank laying out an entire worldview, filled with ad hominems, bad faith, and clearly has not changed anyone’s minds.</p>
          <p>Remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution#bodyContent">Pareto’s observation</a> about where most of the value in a subject comes from, and the value of your time!
