<p><b>The Japanese <i>Fifth Generation Project</i> in computer technology was an 
attempt to leapfrog Western computer expertise and create an entirely new 
computer technology. Although the generation terminology is a bit murky, there 
was the general perception that there had been a a number of <i>generations</i> 
of computer design and the accompanying operating methods. 
</b></p><p><b>The first generation 
was the mainframe computers created by Sperry Rand and IBM during and after World 
War II. They were hard-wired to carry out the desired sequence of computations. 
John Von Neumann and Herman Goldstine showed how hard wiring could be replaced by an 
internally stored program. Machine language program was feasible but oh so 
tedious. Assembly language programming was a great advance in its day. Mnemonic 
commands could be <i>assembled</i> and <i>compiled</i> into the machine language 
coding required by the computers. But assembly language programming was still 
almost unbearably tedious so when John Bachus and his group created Fortran 
(short for Formula Translation) and John McCarthy created LISP (short for List 
Processing) it was a whole new day in computer technology, a new generation. 
Fortran became the language for routine number crunching and still is to some 
extent despite the development of other more sophisticated computer languages. 
McCarthy&#39;s LISP had an entirely different career. It was founded upon a bit of 
esoteric mathematics called the <a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/lambda.htm">Lambda Calculus</a>. LISP 
had a value at the fringes of computer technology, in particular for what became 
known as <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> or AI. AI researchers in the U.S. made 
<a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/lisp.htm">LISP</a> their standard. While was LISP was mathematically sophisticated it was 
almost terminally <i>klutzy</i> in its terminology. Standard operations 
such as finding the head of a list and the tail of a list were known as CAR and 
CDR, for cumulative additive register and cumulative decrement register. 
Outsiders could easily mistake the klutziness of LISP for primitiveness.
 In 
Europe a new computer language was developed called <a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/prolog.htm">PROLOG</a> (short for logic 
programming) that was slicker than LISP and had potential for AI.
 
</b></p><p><b>The Japanese Fifth Generation project was a collaborative effort of the 
Japanese computer industry coordinated by the Japanese Government that intended 
not only to update the hardware technology of computers but alleviate the 
problems of programming by creating AI operating systems that would ferret out 
what the user wanted and then do it. The Project chose to use PROLOG as the 
computer language for the AI programming instead of the LISP-based programming 
of the American AI researchers. 
</b></p><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i>&#39; story on the demise of the Fifth Generation Project ran 
with a picture carrying the following caption: 
</b></p><blockquote><b>&#34;Ten years ago we faced criticism of being too reckless,&#34; said 
Kazuhiro Fuchi, Fifth Generation&#39;s head. &#34;Now we see criticism from inside and 
outside the country because we have failed to achieve such grand goals.&#34; 
</b></blockquote><b>
<p>The story itself was as follows: 
</p><p>Tokyo June 4.--A bold 10-year effort by Japan to seize the lead in computer 
technology is fizzling to a close having failed to meet many of its ambitious 
goals or to produce technology that Japan&#39;s computer industry wanted. After 
spending $400 million on its widely heralded Fifth Generation computer project, 
the Japanese Government said this week that it was willing to give away the 
software developed by the project to anyone who wanted it, even foreigners. 
</p><p>Machines That Would Think 
</p></b><p><b>That attitude is a sharp contrast to the project&#39;s inception, when it spread 
fear in the United States that the Japanese were going to leapfrog the American 
computer industry. In response, a group of American companies formed the 
Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, a consortium in Austin, 
Texas, to cooperate on research. And the Defense Department, in part to meet the 
Japanese challenge, began a huge long-term program to develop intelligent 
systems, including tanks that could navigate on their own. Now, with a debate in 
the United States about whether the Government should help American companies 
compete, the Fifth Generation venture is a reminder that even Japan&#39;s highly 
regarded Ministry of International Trade and Industry can make mistakes in 
predicting what technologies will be important in the future. The problem for 
Japan is that the computer industry shifted so rapidly that the technological 
path the Fifth Generation took-- which seemed a wise choice in 1982-- turned out 
to be at odds with the computer industry&#39;s direction by 1992. In a sense, 
Japan&#39;s ability to stay the course in pursuit of a long-term payoff-- usually 
considered one of the country&#39;s strongest assets-- turned into a liability. A 
similar challenge for Japan may now be arising in high-definition television. 
Japan&#39;s HDTV system, which has been in development for two decades, is now 
coming to market just as some engineers believe that major shift to digital 
television technology will make the Japanese analog approach obsolete. Yet 
interest in joining government-industry projects continues in Japan. Another 
computer technology program, called the Real World Computing project, is getting 
underway. Executives here said that such programs could lead to valuable results 
even if no useful products emerge from the pipeline. A benefit of the Fifth 
Generation project, for instance, is that it trained hundreds , perhaps 
thousands, of engineers in advanced computer science. </b>
