    <h1>How I think about writing quality code fast with AI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DISCLOSURE: If you buy through affiliate links, I may earn a small commission. <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/disclosures">(disclosures)</a></p><div><p>I recently did a small tech talk at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=afef2b4f097974aa990e8c4e8ae42a60">Recurse Center</a>&#39;s weekly presentation day on software engineering with AI so thought I&#39;d share the key ideas here.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also recorded the presentation slides with a lot more detail (RC presentations are only 5 mins!).</p>

<p>I think of AI as an eager, book-smart junior engineer that doesn&#39;t eat, sleep, or get bored. It&#39;s a super fast reader, typer, and researcher. It&#39;s a decent coder in most mainstream languages and has read tons of books and articles. But it has little hands-on experience, low taste and judgment for choosing what to apply when, and low discipline for sticking to rules.</p>

<p>There are three approaches to building with AI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vibe Coding:</strong> Very fast, hands-off, produces &#34;slop&#34;</li>
<li><strong>Vibe Engineering:</strong> Fast, human-in-the-loop, production-ready</li>
<li><strong>Traditional Engineering:</strong> Slow, hands-on, craftsmanship</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the future is vibe engineering - take the principles of traditional engineering and leverage the super fast speed of AI LLMs.</p>
<p>Different work calls for different approaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tree nodes (critical infrastructure, core value, new frontiers) still need Traditional Engineering.</li>
<li>Branch nodes (CRUD features, N+1 work) benefit from Vibe Engineering.</li>
<li>Leaf nodes (prototypes, internal tools, non-load-bearing code) can tolerate Vibe Coding.</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard agentic AI loop is: <strong>Plan -&gt; Build -&gt; Review</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> You with AI feedback</li>
<li><strong>Build:</strong> AI with you tweaking</li>
<li><strong>Review:</strong> You with AI feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>This is very similar to a normal software engineering cycle. The difference is that you now play the role of the Tech Lead / Manager and AI is the implementer.</p>
<h2 id="going-further">Going Further</h2>
<p>You can enhance each phase:</p>
<p><strong>Better Planning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use layered specs: Product PRD (what exists) -&gt; Change PRD (what we&#39;re building) -&gt; Tech Spec (how to implement)</li>
<li>Define explicit success criteria upfront</li>
<li>Have AI critique your plan and interview you about clarifications</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Better Building:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have AI follow checklists and update progress</li>
<li>Automatically run tests, linters, and builds after changes</li>
<li>Use fresh agents for clear context on each task</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Better Reviews:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Define what &#34;good&#34; looks like in AGENTS files and PRDs</li>
<li>Enforce deterministic guardrails: types, tests, linters, e2e tests</li>
<li>Spin up parallel AI reviewers with different perspectives (correctness, simplicity, performance, security)</li>
</ul>
<p>And once you&#39;ve gotten those loops nice and reliable, you can move onto chains where AI auto passes from one loop to the next.</p>
