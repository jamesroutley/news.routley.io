    <h1>A new system for organizing my writing and projects</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Keeping up with regular blog posts is a challenge.
To do it, I&#39;ve churned through a few different organizational systems.
Sometimes I have to change them due to actual life circumstances changing; other times, due to the old one just wearing off<sup id="fr-self-help-1"><a href="#fn-self-help">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Well, my life circumstances have changed again.
I&#39;m on medical leave right now recovering from surgery<sup id="fr-yay-surgery-1"><a href="#fn-yay-surgery">[2]</a></sup>, and I have been writing less this year anyway.
So it&#39;s that time again: new system, baby.</p>
<p>This post isn&#39;t a how-to.
It&#39;s not a prescription for your own organizational system.
Rather, let it be an invitation to examine your own systems, and decide whether they&#39;re serving you or not.</p>

<p>So what am I replacing?</p>
<p>Before this change, my system involved Obsidian and LunaTask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obsidian for recording ideas</li>
<li>LunaTask for keeping track of works in progress and things that have a due date</li>
</ul>
<p>When I get an intrusive thought about how I definitely need to try to make a transistor at home in my garage<sup id="fr-hubris-1"><a href="#fn-hubris">[3]</a></sup>, I put that in my list of ideas.
This list of ideas contains some ridiculously bad ideas, and some very good ideas.
But the thing is, I can&#39;t tell which is which when I have the idea!
The ideas have to sit and marinate, and then eventually one sticks in my head long enough that it turns itself into a blog post.
With most of the already completed ideas removed, that file is over 150 lines long right now.</p>
<p>LunaTask is used to get these ideas from my brain over the finish line.
I have a project called &#34;Writing&#34; which is kanban style.
Each blog post I earnestly intend to write gets added into it, and then I keep track of which ones are waiting, in progress, and completed.
This is mostly useful for posts which require code to go along with them, or which require research<sup id="fr-lyme-disease-1"><a href="#fn-lyme-disease">[4]</a></sup>.
Posts like this one that are all prose without research go pretty fast and never enter LunaTask.</p>
<p>The thing is, this has been showing cracks.
I&#39;ve stopped recording blog post ideas all that much this year, because I&#39;ve been stressed from &#34;global events&#34; (I&#39;m a trans woman, my wife is an immigrant, etc.) and preparing for multiple surgeries.
And tracking things in LunaTask is just not working for me at all, because it&#39;s disconnected from idea tracking but ends up being its <em>own</em> idea tracking, since I just really want to write <em>all</em> the posts.</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#39;m not 100% sure why LunaTask isn&#39;t working for me right now for this.
It might just be that I need to perturb the system a bit to make a change.
But no matter what the cause, it&#39;s time to change it.</p>

<p>The new system is simpler than the old, because I&#39;m removing a tool.
I&#39;m taking LunaTask out of my blog toolkit, and switching to tracking <em>everything</em> in Obsidian.</p>
<p>The new system is going to be smaller:</p>
<ul>
<li>an ideas page in Obsidian</li>
<li>a works-in-progress page</li>
<li>a task tracker for recurring blog tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m using a task tracking plugin in Obsidian for the recurring tasks, because there are some things I need to do on a regular schedule.
If I want to publish on Monday, that means that the post needs to be written before the weekend and edited before Monday.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not using task tracking for actual <em>posts</em> because I know from personal experience that it ends up similar to my ideas page but with structure.
I&#39;m also not using Obsidian&#39;s Bases for this, because a raw text file is just the lowest friction way I&#39;ve found to do what I need.
A raw text file lets me move things around freely, add notes however and wherever I want, and do freeform brain dumps.
Structure is a little tyrant that kills my motivation at certain phases, so bye bye structure, we&#39;re doing a coup here.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>So far, so good with the new system.
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be onto another one eventually.
The most important thing, I&#39;ve found, is to remain mindful of whether or not the systems are working for you.
Change them once they stop working.</p>

<li id="fn-self-help">
<p>There&#39;s this phenomenon where self-help productivity books almost always help you when you adopt a new system.
But the help doesn&#39;t last forever!
It seems that <em>changing</em> your system helps in some way, perhaps from the increased awareness and mindfulness, or maybe from new dopamine. <a href="#fr-self-help-1">↩</a></p>

<p>It was a planned gender affirming surgery.
The recovery is long and challenging, but I&#39;m recovering very well.
I&#39;m very thankful for the support I have from my friends, family, and community. <a href="#fr-yay-surgery-1">↩</a></p>

<li id="fn-hubris">
<p>How hard can it be?
The hubris of a software engineer knows no bounds, except for that refactor you know you should do but that you think is just a little too hard.
(And yes, making a transistor would be <em>very</em> hard, and no, I&#39;m not going to do it.
Probably.
The thoughts are still here.) <a href="#fr-hubris-1">↩</a></p>

<li id="fn-lyme-disease">
<p>I have a partially written post on Lyme disease which I do intend to complete, but it&#39;s a topic that I really want to be careful around.
And so it languishes. <a href="#fr-lyme-disease-1">↩</a></p>
