                     For each pair of points <em>x,y</em> on the surface, the tangent-point energy considers the radius <em>r</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) of the smallest sphere tangent to <em>x</em> and passing through <em>y</em>, penalizing 1/<em>r</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>).  Hence, the contribution will be very large for points <em>y</em> close in space but distant along the surface—and small for points <em>z</em> nearby along the surface, where the radius is huge.

                     Ad-hoc schemes such as vertex-vertex Coulomb forces do not correspond to a meaningful smooth energy and can be numerically unstable.  Here we minimize Coulomb and tangent-point energies subject to a fixed area constraint.

                     Willmore energy does nothing to prevent intersections (in red), and can have minimizers that asymmetrically distribute curvature over the surface.  <span>Right:</span> tangent-point energy avoids intersections and tends to provide a more uniform curvature distribution.

                     Unlike other numerical schemes, our fractional preconditioner does not suffer from a mesh-dependent time step restriction.  Here for example we take 300 optimization steps of maximum size (determined by line search) for each scheme.  As resolution increases, all methods but <em>H<sup>s</sup></em> make slower and slower progress.  Note also that schemes based on <em>H<sup>1</sup></em> preconditioning (<em>H<sup>1</sup></em>, <em>H<sup>1</sup></em> L-BFGS, AQP, BCQN) quickly eliminate high-frequency details but are slower to smooth the bulk shape; conversely, <em>H<sup>2</sup></em> quickly smooths out the bulk shape but fine details remain.  Using <em>H<sup>s</sup></em> for 1 &lt; <em>s</em> &lt; 2 nicely handles both local and global features.

                     Gallery of isotopies obtained by minimizing tangent-point energy—notice that highly knotted surfaces, as well as surfaces with thin sheets and handles, successfully flow to their canonical embeddings. Surfaces are grouped by their isotopy equivalence classes, which are extremely difficult to determine via visual inspection (and also not simply determined by Euler characteristic—see table of knotted embeddings below).

                     Global minimizers of geometric energies provide canonical domains that can be used to map between surfaces of the same topology, or simply help visualize a topological space.  Here we show conjectured minimizers of the tangent-point energy for unknotted surfaces of genus <em>g</em>; adjacent figures illustrate symmetries (when present).

                     Geometric functionals provide a bridge between topology and geometry by enabling one to construct canonical geometric representatives of a given topological space.  Here, minimizers of tangent point energy are used to visualize nontrivial isotopy classes of a genus-2 surface.

                     Minimizing the tangent-point energy of a punctured torus while pushing signed volume toward zero yields a surface with reflection symmetry. Applying a reflection and reversing the flow hence yields an eversion that turns the surface ``inside-out&#39;&#39; while avoiding self-intersections.

                     The tangent-point energy can be used to make variational surface modeling responsive to proximity, rather than just collisions.  Here for instance we pin a sparse or dense set of points and modify volume and surface area to adjust the appearance of some text (in some cases enclosed in a box).  Like Willmore energy <span>(top right)</span>, we get smooth behavior near point constraints (see magnified portion), but avoid overlap.

                     Here we perform a simple ``shrink wrapping&#39;&#39; to obtain a manifold, intersection-free reconstruction <span>(top</span>), which works well even for points or polygon soup with severe holes and missing data.

                     We can also ``shrink wrap&#39;&#39; a model to get a sequence of progressively coarser approximating envelopes that exhibit a strict containment property, and are free of self-intersection.  Here we aim for a 1.15x increase in volume at each level.

                     We can also use tangent-point energy for generative modeling by ``growing&#39;&#39; a surface subject to constraints.  <span>Top:</span> confining to a sphere while increasing area leads to a wrinkled shape reminiscent of a walnut. <span>Bottom:</span> growing many small spheres inside a slab yields a tileable cobblestone pattern.

                     Fast positional constraints enable Dirichlet boundary conditions.  Here, minimizing tangent-point energy on a cylinder yields a nearly spherical geometry <span>(left)</span>.  Using tangent-point energy to regularize area minimization avoids the usual pinch-off singularities in minimal surfaces <span>(center)</span>.  We can also compute (near-)minimal surfaces with obstacles, in the spirit of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-10970-6_3">[Giusti 1973]</a> <span>(right)</span>.
