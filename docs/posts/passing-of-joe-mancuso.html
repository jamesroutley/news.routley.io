        <p dir="auto">Good morning Masonite community,</p>
<p dir="auto">I regret to inform you all that <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/josephmancuso/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/josephmancuso">@josephmancuso</a> has passed away due to health complications. Please keep his family in your thoughts during this time.</p>
<p dir="auto">I had the privilege of working alongside Joe for many years, and it was clear as day how much Masonite meant to him. Even when fighting for his life, he continued doing everything he could to maintain and support this project.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the beautiful things about open source is that we build <strong>together</strong>. While Joe is no longer with us, Masonite can continue to grow and evolve through the contributions of this community. I hope we all continue working toward the vision he poured so much of himself into.</p>
