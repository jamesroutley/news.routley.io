</div><p>Titanium is the ninth most abundant element in the Earth&#39;s crust, yet products based on pure titanium are uncommon because it&#39;s expensive to remove the oxygen from titanium ore. Reducing costs would encourage manufacturers to take advantage of the highly useful properties of titanium in their products.</p>


		

                                    <p>Now, in a study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49085-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> in <i>Nature Communications</i>, researchers from the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, have developed a procedure that reduces the cost of producing titanium that&#39;s almost entirely free of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/oxygen/" rel="tag">oxygen</a>. This oxygen removal protocol might benefit <a href="https://phys.org/tags/technological+development/" rel="tag">technological development</a> and environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Titanium is an incredibly versatile material because not only does it typically resist chemical damage, it&#39;s strong yet light. For example, its light weight compared with other metals is why the base frame of modern iPhones consists of titanium alloy, despite the increased cost.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, producing ultrapure titanium is significantly more expensive than manufacturing steel (an iron alloy) and aluminum, owing to the substantial use of energy and resources in preparing high-purity titanium. Developing a cheap, easy way to prepare it—and facilitate product development for industry and common consumers—is the problem the researchers aimed to address.</p>
<p>&#34;Industry mass-produces iron and aluminum <a href="https://phys.org/tags/metal/" rel="tag">metal</a>—but not titanium metal, because of the expense of removing the oxygen from the ore,&#34; explains Toru H. Okabe, lead author of the study. &#34;We use an innovative technology based on <a href="https://phys.org/tags/rare-earth+metals/" rel="tag">rare-earth metals</a> that removes oxygen from titanium to 0.02% on a per-mass basis.&#34;</p>

                                            <p>A critical step in the researchers&#39; protocol is reacting molten titanium with yttrium metal and yttrium trifluoride or a similar substance. The end result is a low-cost, solid, de-oxygenated titanium alloy. The reacted yttrium can be recycled for further use. A highlight of the researchers&#39; work is that even titanium scrap that contains large amounts of oxygen can be processed in this manner.</p>
<p>&#34;We&#39;re excited by the versatility of our protocol,&#34; says Toru H. Okabe. &#34;The lack of intermediate compounds and straightforward procedures will facilitate adoption in industry.&#34;</p>
<p>This work is an important step forward in making more efficient use of high-purity titanium than at present. A limitation of this work is that the resulting de-oxygenated titanium contains yttrium, up to 1% by mass; yttrium can influence the mechanical and chemical properties of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/titanium/" rel="tag">titanium</a> alloy. After solving the yttrium contamination problem, applications to industrial manufacturing will be straightforward.</p>
