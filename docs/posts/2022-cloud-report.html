          <p>When we paid explicitly for a resource we got the promised performance out of that resource.</p>

          <p>However, in cases where the cloud provider advertised a performance range (e.g. “up to 10 Gbps”) and did not explicitly charge for a specific level of performance, the results varied between cloud providers and between runs.</p>

          <p>We saw a wide range in performance for non-network optimized instance types, including some apparent throttling.</p>
