<p>For nearly a month now, Backblaze has been fixated on a particular file of mine, that happens to be over 1 TB in size.  Backblaze seemingly uploads it completely, but then on the next backup it uploads it again, even though it has not changed (in eight years!).  Ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Using their <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/computer-backup/docs/use-explainfile-to-diagnose-backup-issues-mac" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Explainfile</a> tool to dig into the log files, the clue seems to be:</p>
<pre>  - line 288 - 2024-12-16 16:16:17 0000000646 - ERROR: UpdateBzDoneRegardingFlsToBeExp - Z_B_TOO_MANY_CHUNKS bz_done_ line chunk related, numBytesInLargeFile=1099512156951, totNumChunks=104858, bz_done_line_is: 5	! …</pre>
<p>Admittedly I’m guessing somewhat, since that’s a rather reader-hostile log message, but the combination of the <code><strong>Z_B_TOO_MANY_CHUNKS</strong></code> error mnemonic and <code><strong>chunkSeq=100001</strong></code> (because of its proximity to the arbitrary round number 100,000) strongly suggests that Backblaze is imposing a 100,000 chunk limit.  Since chunks are 10 MB each, that’s exactly 1 TB.</p>
<p>This is unequivocally at odds with what they claim repeatedly on their website, on pages like <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/features/what-gets-backed-up" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">What Backblaze Backs Up</a> and <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/computer-backup/docs/file-sizes" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">File Sizes</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not clear to me why this is suddenly a problem; is this a newly-imposed limit?  It’s possible that a month ago I removed some exclusion on the file, but I don’t remembering doing that and I can see no reason why I would have excluded it to begin with.  If it is newly imposed, that would imply it’s also <em>retroactive</em> – that Backblaze actually <em>deleted</em> the existing backup of the file from their servers, thus causing the client app to try uploading it again.</p>
<p>I reached out to their technical support, of course, but thus far have only received mindless responses – restart your computer, reinstall Backblaze, etc.</p>
