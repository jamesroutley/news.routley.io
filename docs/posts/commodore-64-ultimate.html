<h3>Is this a Kickstarter?</h3>
<p>Not quite - this is an official Commodore® preorder with a money-back guarantee. Similar to crowdfunding, every penny goes into manufacturing first, and then to the mission to reboot Commodore itself. By skipping Kickstarter, we avoid big platform fees and pass the savings on to you - just like our founder Jack Tramiel would’ve wanted. </p>

<h3>Am I charged now or at shipping, and what currency?</h3>
<p>You’re charged now, in USD (your local currency shows until checkout). Like Kickstarter and others, your preorder funds production at the factory. The rest helps reboot the Commodore brand.</p>

<h3>Can I get a refund?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. You’re in control. Cancel anytime before shipping with our <strong>no quibble money-back guarantee</strong> for a full refund - no questions asked. Have an account? <a href="https://www.commodore.net/my-orders" target="_blank"><u>Cancel there</u></a> with one click. No account? Use our <a href="https://www.commodore.net/contact-us" target="_blank"><u>support form</u></a> and we’ll sort it fast.</p>

<h3>How does shipping work?</h3>
<p>We deliver from Commodore &amp; Commodore partner hubs in the USA, UK, and EU (including our original 1980s Corby building). If you’re farther out, we ship via trusted couriers like DHL, FedEx, UPS, or Chickenlips Express.</p>

<h3>Will I pay sales tax?</h3>
<p>USA: Sales tax is added at checkout where required.</p>
<p>UK &amp; Europe: VAT/IVA/MwSt is added at checkout.</p>

<h3>What about tariffs?</h3>
<p>If your country charges import tariffs (e.g. the USA), you’ll see a “Tariff Tax” at checkout. This covers everything upfront, so there’s nothing more to pay later. We don’t control these fees, but we avoid surprises. If tariffs drop after you pay, we’ll refund you at shipping. If they rise a lot before shipping, we may adjust- but only if truly needed to protect Commodore’s future. </p>

<h3>What about customs duties?</h3>
<p>We aim to prepay duties (DDP) where possible. In some places (e.g. Norway, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore), you might get a tax refund before shipping. Some countries may still charge customs fees on arrival - these aren’t included and as is commonplace, these are your responsibility.</p>

<h3>Isn&#39;t this just an emulator or rebadged something-or-other?</h3>
<p>The Commodore 64 Ultimate from the only original Commodore® brand (est. 1958) is brand new hardware-based Commodore 64 technology. It features SID chip-reactive LEDs (case, keyboard, power light*), the world&#39;s first transparent keyboard PCB*, original and modern creators’ autographs etched in copper, and an updated FPGA that replicates the original C64 motherboard (not emulation). All customisable via a new, easy main menu. It’s a fully authentic new build from Commodore - who else?</p>
<p><em>*except beige version</em></p>

<h3>Will Commodore 64 Ultimate units still ship if the acquisition doesn’t complete?</h3>
<p>Good news - as of 31st July 2025 we paid the sellers in full, ahead of schedule, and signed the final contracts to complete the acquisition. Even before that, we had a contract guaranteeing these machines would be made no matter what.</p>

<h3>So what are the risks?</h3>
<p>All launches have some risk, whether you&#39;re Apple or Commodore. But this preorder is unusually safe. Most parts are already in production. The motherboard is a proven design. Cases shipped in January 2025. Keycaps shipped in 2024. Just a few parts remain, like the keyboard base, made by a trusted partner since the Apple II era. All components are pro-designed to fit together. Add the box, manual, and power supply, and we’re set.</p>

<h3>Is there a warranty?</h3>
<p>Yes. Our products include a 1-year limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. For customers in the EU or UK, your purchase also complies with local consumer protection laws, including the EU Consumer Rights Directive and UK Consumer Rights Act, which provide additional rights. You can also add an extended warranty <a href="https://www.commodore.net/product-page/commodore-warranty" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</p>

<h3>Can I email/DM you to suggest a feature change?</h3>
<p>We’re not planning hardware changes right now. Chances are we already debated it over chickenlips snacks. We’re reviewing ideas from our launch form and will reach out if your Commodore 256 Ultra-Turbo-CD-Lightgun-Keyring makes the cut.</p>
