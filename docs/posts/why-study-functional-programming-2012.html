<h2>...or, &#34;why make programming even harder?&#34;</h2>

<p>Learning functional programming is an opportunity to discover a new way to represent programs, to approach
problems, and to think about languages. While programming with a functional language is still fundamentally 
similar to programming with any other type of language (examples of others being imperative or logic), it
represents programs and algorithms through distinct forms of abstraction and gives you a new toolset with which to
solve programming problems. Additionally, many of the techniques of functional programming are beginning
to permeate new mainstream languages, so taking the time now to develop a thorough understanding of them
is an investment which will pay great dividends.</p>

For more information, it is best to search the internet for pages arguing why it is worth your time to learn specific functional languages. Many such pages are linked below in the relevant sections.
