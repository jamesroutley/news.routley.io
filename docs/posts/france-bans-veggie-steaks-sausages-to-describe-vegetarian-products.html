    <h1>France bans veggie ′steaks,′ ′sausages′ to describe vegetarian products</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Plant-based meat alternatives will have to come up with new terminology in France. The country adopted a measure banning plant-based products from using the same names as food from dead animals.</p><div>
<div>
<p>France will become the first European Union country to ban the use of words like &#34;steak&#34; and &#34;sausage&#34; from being applied to <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/from-funky-lollipops-to-vegan-cheese-food-startups-flock-to-paris/a-58764579">plant-based food,</a> according to an official decree published on Thursday. The ban, which was originally agreed to in 2020, will go into effect in October.</p> <p>&#34;It will not be possible to use sector-specific terminology traditionally associated with meat and fish to designate products that do not belong to the animal world and which, in essence, are not comparable,&#34; the official decree reads.</p> <p>The regulation only applies to products made in France, and the country&#39;s largest farm lobby FNSEA said it did not go far enough as it left the door open to imports. It said that similar laws should be enacted &#34;at the European level,&#34; but the EU rejected a similar proposal in 2020.</p>  <p>Some terms, such as &#34;butter,&#34; &#34;milk,&#34; and &#34;cheese&#34; are already protected on the European level and cannot be applied to plant-based products. Words like &#34;burger&#34; are, however, allowed to be used on meat alternatives.</p> <p>The market for vegetarian and vegan meat-like food has surged in recent years as more people concerned about climate change, animal welfare, and nutrition <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-universities-almost-banish-meat-from-canteens/a-59084960">turns to plant-based diets</a>. This has in turn attracted major investment from global agrifood groups hoping to capitalize on <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-produced-less-meat-more-vegan-alternatives-in-2020/a-57527678">a trend towards healthy eating.</a></p> <p>Angel investors, venture capitalists, as well as increased investments from agrifood giants such as Cargill, Danone and Nestle, have helped boost growth to 19% per year.</p> <p>es/sms (AFP, Reuters)</p>
