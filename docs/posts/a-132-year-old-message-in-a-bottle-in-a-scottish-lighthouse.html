That’s when he saw it: an old glass bottle with something curled up inside.</p><p>He and his colleagues fished the bottle out of its hiding place, called the lighthouse keeper and congregated at the bottom of the structure to inspect their discovery. Inside the bottle, which was stoppered with rusted wire wrapped around an old cork, was a note handwritten in cursive.</p><p>How old, exactly, became clear when they drilled away the cork and pulled the note through the bottleneck using two cables. The date on the header: Sept. 4, 1892.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We were shaking, especially me,” said Barry Miller, the lighthouse keeper for Corsewall Lighthouse who raced over last month when the workers told him what they had found. “I couldn’t keep my hands still, and I read the note out to the other guys.”</p><p>Was it a love letter, a disgruntled complaint or someone’s final goodbye? “We all swore ourselves to silence if it was a treasure map,” he joked.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Northern Lighthouse Board</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Northern Lighthouse Board</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>If not as lucrative as a treasure map, the note turned out to be more relevant to their work, at least: It was a 132-year-old missive, written in ink, from former engineers and lighthouse keepers who were installing a new Fresnel lens and lantern at the top of the tower. </p><p>“This lantern was erected by James Wells Engineer, John Westwood Millwright, James Brodie Engineer and David Scott Labourer, of the firm of James Milne &amp; Son Engineers, Milton House Works, Edinburgh,<em> </em>during the months from May to September and relighted on Thursday night 15th Sept 1892,” it said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Other engineers who had worked on the lens were also named, along with the Corsewall Lighthouse keepers at the time: John Wilson, John B. Henderson and John Lockhart.</p><p>“By great coincidence, we were working on the very lens which they had installed,” Dr. Miller said, adding: “It was a direct communication from them to us.”</p><p>When the note was written, Queen Victoria was Britain’s monarch and Grover Cleveland would soon return for a second presidential term in the United States. Mr. Russell, 36, the engineer, said the bottled message gave him a sense of being connected to the past: “It almost sent shivers up your spine, because you knew that what he was reading out had been written 132 years ago.”</p><p>“To find a bottle and a note on the beach would be incredible enough, never mind in the wall of a lighthouse,” he said, calling it a “right-good time capsule.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Four lighthouse workers at the Corsewall Lighthouse.

But it’s a temporary home. Once the refurbishment is complete, the group said, the note and bottle will be returned to the hiding place in Corsewall Lighthouse where it had sat for more than 130 years.</p><p>Beside it will be one addition: another bottle, this time with a note from the engineers and keepers from this age describing their work and signing their names.</p><p>“Sometime in the future, perhaps, we will be able to communicate to someone else,” Dr. Miller said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>4</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>132 Years Later, Lighthouse Crew Finds Helpful Message in Bottle<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
