    <h1>Recurse Center Week 2</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="week-2-recap">Week 2 Recap<a href="#week-2-recap" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>Ok, this post is a few days late and it’s technically the start of week 3 now, but late is better than never!
This post will likely be a bit shorter than <a href="https://blog.luxatweb.dev/posts/recurse-center-week-1/">the first one</a>, mostly because I want to get back to working on my character creator.
Last week I shared that I had three goals I decided to focus on:</p><ol><li>A 5e character creator TUI</li><li>Learning Rust</li><li>Learning Wails &amp; Svelte</li></ol><p>I also shared that these were all subject to change, and sure enough they already have!
I’ve decided that while there’s a lot I find compelling about Rust (especially when it comes to enums &amp; pattern matching), I ultimately don’t enjoy actually reading or writing it, and if I’m going to learn something for “learning’s sake”, I’d like to enjoy what I’m learning!
I also think I underestimated how much goes into a character creator.
It’s for these reasons that I’ve decided to drop Rust from the list.
Maybe I’ll come back to it in the future, maybe I won’t, we’ll just have to see!</p><h2 id="character-creator">Character Creator<a href="#character-creator" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>So I’ve mentioned this character creator several times now but haven’t really said much about what it actually is.
Right now, it’s not much - just a listing of all 12 classes with the option to select one. You can see a short <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/VEwPcLqigzde130HjaWB5m9qM">demo on asciinema</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
I’m using the <a href="https://github.com/5e-bits/5e-srd-api">5e-srd-api</a> as the data source and <a href="https://github.com/Khan/genqlient/tree/main/docs">genqlient</a> to interact with the GraphQL API.
For the UI, I’m currently using a combination of <a href="https://charm.sh/">charm.sh</a> libraries, including <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/huh">huh</a> and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea">bubbletea</a>.
I may end up ditching <code>huh</code> and leaning more directly on <code>bubbletea</code>, as <code>huh</code> seems to be a little more limited than I realized; for example, there doesn’t seem to be a clear way to grab the current item the cursor is “hovering” over without manually keeping track of which group &amp; input the form is at.</p><p>The biggest challenge, however, is figuring out how to model the character data. I knew going in this would be a bit complicated, but I figured I have plenty of experience manually creating characters so it couldn’t be <em>that</em> hard.
I was wrong!
There’s a lot of moving pieces to 5e characters that affect each other in a lot of ways, and figuring out how those pieces all fit together programmatically is a bit of a puzzle.
Luckily for me, another Recurser (Eric Allen, check him out at <a href="https://interwebalchemy.com/">Interweb Alchemy</a>) had looked into this previously and gave me a few helpful resources to check out:</p><ul><li>a <a href="https://github.com/RobinKuiper/Roll20APIScripts/blob/master/BeyondImporter_5eOGL/BeyondImporter.js">Roll20 script</a> that imports characters from D&amp;D Beyond, which looks like it will be helpful in getting a grasp on how other’s have solved this problem before</li><li>a <a href="https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/72139/oop-architecture-for-hero-with-many-attributes">stack overflow post about character architecture</a></li></ul><p>He also shared his <a href="https://github.com/DVDAGames/js-die-roller/tree/main">D20 roller library</a> which I may end up taking some inspiration from when it comes to ability score rolling<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p><h2 id="plan-for-this-week">Plan for This Week<a href="#plan-for-this-week" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>I want to have something a little more demo-able by the end of the week. I’m going to spend a lot of heads down time hacking away at this and see where I get, but I’m trying to not stress out too much about it.
I’m also hoping the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1717-2024-core-rulebooks-to-expand-the-srd">5.2 SRD</a> comes out soon, as I really like a lot of the changes in the 2024 rules update, and I’d like to use them for this project.</p></div></div></div>
