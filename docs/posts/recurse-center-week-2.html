        <p>Orientation is done! We’re in the batch for real now.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>A few folks in my batch were interested in the <a href="https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/sqlite/overview">CodeCrafters SQLite course</a>, so I gave that a try. It didn’t end up meeting our expectations. Rather than giving any sort of step-by-step explanation of what you should do, the course just sort of links to the SQLite docs. I attempted to forge ahead regardless; after much frustration I some tangible progress. <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/sqlite/">My implementation</a> can count the number of the tables in the a SQLite database, and tell you their names. I now feel confident that I <em>could</em> write code that queries the data in a SQLite database, but I’m not sure I want to spend the rest of my batch down this rabbit hole. For now I’ll be putting it to the side.</p>
<p>I tried to improve <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaac/hindsight">Hindsight</a> (my app to remind me to take breaks while coding) by detecting if the camera is on, rather than if Zoom is open. At first I tried using a library but <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-camera-on/issues/4">it doesn’t work on my model of macbook</a>, so for now Hindsight will remain un-improved. Someone did link to the apparent <a href="https://github.com/wouterdebie/onair/issues/3">source of the issue</a>, so maybe I’ll take some time in the future to dig in and fix the problem?</p>
<p>For my still-unnamed programming language I spent some time on <a href="https://ryanisaacg.com/code/recurse-week-2/programming-language-for-fun">a blog post</a> and made some progress on understanding language servers. I didn’t ship any major new features, but I did lay the foundation for supporting hover information and error highlighting<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-highlighting" id="user-content-fnref-highlighting" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This week I also started two new projects: <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/iceload">Iceload</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/wasmtime-dl"><code>wasmtime-dl</code></a>.</p>
<p>Iceload is my toy clone of <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">Firestore</a>, a document database with built-in pub/sub capabilities. My goal is to be able to get the developer experience of Firestore (easy setup, easy subscriptions to values, no need for a separate application server) in a local-first, “handmade” dev environment. I’m using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sled"><code>sled</code></a> for the key/value store and persistence<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-couldwant" id="user-content-fnref-couldwant" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>, and a websocket to communicate with clients. Currently basic document operations (get, insert, update, remove) all work! The next major steps are supporting subscriptions, creating the schema, and access control.</p>
<p><code>wasmtime-dl</code> is a truly cursed Rust crate. Given a shared library (<code>dll</code> on Windows, <code>dylib</code> on macOS, <code>so</code> on Linux), I want to be able to expose that library’s exports to a wasmtime instance. Importantly I want to do this without needing to hand-write bindings that tell the wasmtime linker about the library; I want to drive the process with data instead. This is important for my programming language project; if I want my package to include some native functionality (say SDL2 bindings) I don’t want to have to drop down to Rust. Instead I should be able to describe the exported functions from the shared library and then bind it into the WASM VM. I’m excited to put <code>wasmtime-dl</code> into “production” in week 3 as I build out functionality for programs to bind to their host environments.</p>
<p>The curse of <code>wasmtime-dl</code> is how it goes about this binding: 16,000 lines of generated Rust code to pattern match over possible shapes of functions. For every combination of <code>i32</code>/<code>f32</code>/<code>i64</code>/<code>f64</code> parameters (up to 4) and return values (including <code>void</code> returns), there’s a match case generated. Then for every function with just <code>i32</code> parameters (up to 16) and either a returned <code>i32</code> or <code>void</code> has its own case. Originally I wanted to support any primitive for up to 16 arguments, but the combinatorial explosion is real. That would have taken millions of lines of generated code, I think?</p>
<p>At the very tail end of the week I started on the <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">Raytracing in One Weekend</a> with a pair of other Recursers in my batch. We got through all the setup and are poised to actually start tracing some rays, which should be fun!</p>
<p>Week 2 was significantly more social than Week 1, because I spent a lot more time in-person at the hub. I find it hard to avoid going heads-down on my remote days, and end up wiling away the hours working without much interaction. As a result I find myself planning to spend as much time in the hub as possible, even though I’m a staunch remote-work fan. Something for me to think about over the next ten weeks, I guess!</p>
