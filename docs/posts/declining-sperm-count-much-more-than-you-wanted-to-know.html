Either the sperm count distribution isn’t wide enough to push a substantial number of people below the 30 million bar, or something else is wrong with the theory.</span></p><p>Levine et al model the sperm decline as linear. If they’re right, we have about 10 - 20 more years before the median reaches the plateau’s edge where fertility decreases, and about 10 years after that before it reaches zero. Developing countries might have a little longer.</p><p>It feels wrong to me to model this linearly, although I can’t explain exactly why besides “it means sperm will reach precisely 0 in thirty years, which is surely false”. The authors don’t seem to be too attached to linearity, saying that “Adding a quadratic or cubic function of year to meta-regression model did not substantially change the association between year and SC or improve the model fit”.</p><p><span>Still, the 2022 meta-analysis found that the trend was, if anything, </span><em>speeding up</em><span> with time, so it doesn’t seem to be obviously sublinear.</span></p><p><span>The first recorded claim about declining sperm counts was in </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028216404541?via%3Dihub" rel="">Nelson &amp; Bunge, 1974</a><span>.

There were some previous small unreliable studies before 1951 (the earliest was 1929) that seemed to get vaguely similar numbers to the 1951 study.

Some studies from 2005 show higher sperm counts than most studies from the 1970s. The biggest pre-1980 study shows sperm counts very similar to today’s.</p></li></ol><p><span>It looks like a lot depends on why these sperm count studies are so noisy, and how much we can trust their methodology. Here the best source is Auger et al, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41585-022-00626-w" rel="">Spatiotemporal Trends In Human Semen Quality</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Human sperm production is widely believed to be declining over time, but evidence from the scientific literature is less clear. Studies based on repeated cross-sectional data from a single centre have shown mixed results. Among the numerous retrospective studies conducted in a single centre, only some included homogeneous groups of men and appropriate methods, and most of them suggest a temporal decrease in human sperm production in the geographical areas considered. </p><p>Conclusions reporting temporal trends in sperm production that came from existing retrospective multicentre studies based on individual semen data and those using means, medians or estimates of sperm production are questionable, owing to intrinsic limitations in the studies performed. Regardless of study design, studies on the percentage of motile or morphologically normal spermatozoa are still limited by the inherent variability in assessment. </p><p>Overall, available data do not enable us to conclude that human semen quality is deteriorating worldwide or in the Western world, but that a trend is observed in some specific areas.</p></blockquote><p>Instead of comparing studies from all over the world, it might be safer to look at single-center studies, ie where a single hospital or lab has been recording sperm counts for decades, presumably using the same methods for the same population. The authors were able to find about seventy such studies. Unfortunately, they were pretty contradictory:</p><blockquote><p>With respect to trends in sperm concentration (or total sperm count when concentration was not determined), 57% of studies reported a decrease in sperm production over time . . . 29% of all studies reported no change and 12% indicated an increasing trend.</p></blockquote><p>Why such variable results? Here are some common confounders:</p><ul><li><p>Where are sperm samples coming from? Some people give samples because they are sperm donors, others because they are infertile and want to figure out why. Infertile men may be infertile because they have unusually low-quality sperm. If something changes the fertile/infertile balance among sperm sample givers, or changes when people start worrying about fertility enough to give sperm samples, then data will be confounded. Especially the rise of IVF during the period under study has increased the degree to which infertile men might give sperm samples.</p></li><li><p>In the old days, when this was groundbreaking research, most studies were done in cutting-edge research centers in wealthy regions of advanced countries. These places tend to be healthier and have higher sperm counts. Now that this line of research has caught on, everyone is doing it, and that means more underdeveloped areas with worse health and lower sperm counts are in the dataset.</p></li><li><p>Sperm count is affected by age -  if your area’s population is aging, that will change its average sperm count from year to year. </p></li><li><p>Different countries (and, in the US, different races) seem to have different sperm counts. If your community’s demographics are changing (eg immigration), that might change its average sperm count. </p></li><li><p>After ejaculation, sperm count decreases and takes a while to build back up again; if your community’s ejaculation frequency is changing (eg people have gained access to online porn), that will change its average sperm count.</p></li></ul><p>But beyond all of this, collecting sperm is hard. Here’s Auger et al:</p><blockquote><p>At the beginning of the 1980s, the WHO recommended standardized approaches for assessing human semen, which have evolved and been updated over time. However, some of the discussed studies began before the 1980s, when the WHO guidelines were implemented. In addition, many studies did not describe their methods precisely or did not follow the WHO guidelines at all. Furthermore, several studies stated that the WHO recommended procedures were followed, but the description of the procedures used suggests noticeable deviations from the recommended procedures. </p><p>Others even reported changing methods during the study period, for example, for sperm count analysis. Changing a procedure can be a notable confounding factor if the periods before and after the change are not analysed separately. For example, counting spermatozoa in a haemocytometer, a single-use calibrated chamber or a Makler chamber does not produce the same count. Similarly, changing the procedure for assessing normal sperm morphology from old WHO guidelines to the more recent WHO recommendations, which are based on stricter criteria, results in markedly different percentages of morphologically normal spermatozoa</p><p>Finally, fewer than half of the discussed studies considered inter-observer variability, including both occasional and intrinsic variability within the same pool of technicians and the changes in these pools over the years. In addition, few studies mention the existence of concomitant internal quality controls that are necessary to maintain satisfactory intra-individual and inter-individual homogeneity in semen assessment over time.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094014308000025" rel="">Fisch (2008)</a><span> has some colorful commentary:</span></p><blockquote><p>Obtaining human semen for scientific analysis is logistically difficult. As many authors have pointed out, the fact that semen is almost universally obtained by masturbation has placed profound limits on the ability of researchers to adequately study this issue. If collection of semen samples were as straightforward as obtaining blood samples, the nature of semen quality changes over time (if any) would have been determined decisively decades ago. A prospective, longitudinal study of semen parameters in a large, multicenter, randomized study of community-dwelling men, although time-consuming and expensive, would provide highly reliable data. Of nearly equal quality would be an analysis of a suitably sized population of randomly selected community-dwelling men analyzed by birth cohort. Unfortunately, neither of these high-quality observational tools has been used to investigate the phenomenon of semen quality because of the logistical and emotional obstacles posed by the means of obtaining semen in a timely and well-controlled manner.</p></blockquote><p>However, Auger identify six (of their original seventy) studies that they say are extremely well done and suffer from none of these potential confounders. They say five of the six still show declining sperm counts, and believe that the effect might be real (they say there is no evidence it is global rather than limited to these five regions but I think if an effect happens in five regions, and there is only one region where it is not happening, it is fair to wonder whether it represents a broader trend). I interpret their conclusions as very cautiously pro-decline-hypothesis (Fisch remains against).</p><p><span>There is also a </span><a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14647273.2021.1917778?src=&amp;journalCode=ihuf20" rel="">Harvard Gender Science Laboratory paper</a><span> that the </span><a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/05/fears-over-falling-human-sperm-count-may-be-overblown/" rel="">media has</a><span> played up as attacking the sperm count decline hypothesis. But it is mostly written by Gender Studies professors, anthropologists, and philosophers, and mostly just says that it sounds sexist to say something bad might be happening to men (it also adds that since some studies have found the decline is higher in Europe, it’s racist for saying something bad is happening to </span><em>white</em><span> men). It makes a few of the points above about how science is hard and measurement error is common, but overall doesn’t make any points that Auger and Fisch don’t make better, and the authors seem very likely to be politically biased.</span></p><p>One interesting corollary of these studies being so noisy: as far as I can tell, basically every person who proposed this hypothesis before Levine et al was mistaken, and had no right to conclude this from their small samples.

I can’t tell whether the difference is significant, and the decline in the developing world is either just above or just below traditional statistical significance depending on how you measure it.</p><p>Auger et al report that they found declining sperm count in:</p><ul><li><p>83% of South American studies</p></li><li><p>64% of European studies</p></li><li><p>50% of Asian studies</p></li><li><p>40% of Australia/New Zealand studies</p></li><li><p>33% of US studies</p></li></ul><p>Just eyeballing it, Scandinavian countries have less sperm decline than Central European, and Japan/Korea have less sperm decline than China.

Auger et al </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41585-022-00626-w" rel="">also found</a><span> that Middle Easterners had some of the lowest sperm counts in their sample, with Egyptians having the lowest count measured.

If I applied the same hyper-skeptical eye to these studies that I apply to the ivermectin studies, they fail.
