    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite"><article id="timeline"><div><div><div><h2><a id="teaxyz-spam"><span>tea.xyz causes a flood of spam pull requests to open source projects</span></a></h2><p><span>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger" target="_blank">crypto skeptic I&#39;ve heard of</a> once said &#34;Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.&#34;<p>A project called tea.xyz promised people they could &#34;get rewards for [their] open-source contributions&#34;, complete with a flashy website describing how it would &#34;enhance the sustainability of open-source software&#34;.</p><p>So far, it&#39;s achieved the exact opposite. Promising to reward open source contributors with crypto tokens, the project asked users to verify their access to open source projects by merging in a YAML file containing their crypto wallet address. This kicked off a flood of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control#Pull_requests" target="_blank">pull requests</a> to prominent, often non-crypto-related open source projects by people who had never contributed to the project (or, often, <i>any</i> open source project), but who wished to merge in a file describing them as a &#34;code owner&#34;.</p><p>Particularly impacted by this project was the open source blogging platform Ghost, which was used as an example in the demo video released by tea.xyz, and which received several PRs of this kind. A somewhat flummoxed maintainer of the repository replied to one PR: &#34;[I]n practice the TEA project is not helping to support the Ghost project, but is instead causing a rush of self-serving PRs to be submitted to cash-in on other people&#39;s work. ... This why people hate on crypto.&#34; A maintainer of another unrelated open source project called &#34;ghost&#34; also reported receiving an influx of spam PRs.</p><p>This is not the first time crypto has generated massive Github spam, although <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=airdrop-hunters-spam-github-projects" target="_blank">another recent incident</a> was (blessedly) mostly limited to open-source crypto projects and didn&#39;t waste the time of non-crypto-related projects as this one has.</p></span></p><ul><li><a href="https://connortumbleson.com/2024/02/26/the-disappointing-tea-xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>&#34;The disappointing tea.xyz&#34;</span></a><span>, Connor Tumbleson</span><span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240227000819/https://connortumbleson.com/2024/02/26/the-disappointing-tea-xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[archive]</a></span></li><li><a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/19743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Github pull request</span></a><span> for Ghost</span><span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240226163916/https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/19743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[archive]</a></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><p><img src="https://primary-cdn.web3isgoinggreat.com/icons/robber.png" alt="" aria-hidden="true"/></p></div><div><div><h2><a id="microstrategy-twitter-hack"><span>$440,000 stolen as MicroStrategy&#39;s Twitter account is hacked</span></a></h2><p><span>MicroStrategy, the company founded and chaired by Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor, suffered a Twitter account compromise on February 26. Although MicroStrategy ostensibly develops software, it&#39;s better known for its massive Bitcoin holdings, driven by Saylor.<p>Although Saylor has been publicly critical of Ethereum, that didn&#39;t seem to raise flags among those eager to receive an <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary#airdrop" target="_blank">airdrop</a> of the Ethereum-based &#34;MSTR&#34; token that the company&#39;s Twitter account claimed they had just launched. Those who fell for the phishing link were redirected to a website that spoofed the real MicroStrategy website, with malicious code that drained funds.</p><p>Around $440,000 was stolen thanks to the fake announcement, with the majority of it coming from one wallet that was drained of a variety of tokens notionally worth around $425,000.</p></span></p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/hackers-exploit-microstrategy-social-media-to-orchestrate-440000-phishing-heist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>&#34;Hackers exploit MicroStrategy social media to orchestrate $440,000 phishing heist&#34;</span></a><span>, <i>CryptoSlate</i></span><span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240226175859/https://cryptoslate.com/hackers-exploit-microstrategy-social-media-to-orchestrate-440000-phishing-heist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[archive]</a></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><p><img src="https://primary-cdn.web3isgoinggreat.com/icons/wtf.png" alt="" aria-hidden="true"/></p></div><div><div><h2><a id="dechat-token-launch-error"><span>Dechat announces its token launch with a link to the wrong token</span></a></h2><p><span>The user experience in crypto is apparently so bad that platforms can&#39;t even keep their <i>own tokens</i> straight. A web3 messaging project, Dechat, announced with some fanfare that the Dechat token would begin trading. In their social media post, however, they erroneously linked to the wrong token on the PancakeSwap cryptocurrency exchange. Instead of linking to the token they had developed, they included a link to a honeypot: that is, a malicious smart contract that aims to entice people to deposit funds that can then be stolen.<p>&#34;You clowns literally linked a honeypot for your own token launch,&#34; wrote crypto sleuth zachxbt. Some users replied that they had lost money to the erroneous link.</p><p>Dechat quickly removed the post and created a new one with a corrected link. They also promised to reimburse users who had lost money to the honeypot.</p></span></p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1762064972966986150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Tweet by zachxbt</span></a><span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/archive/2024-02-26-1/0">[archive]</a></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><p><img src="https://primary-cdn.web3isgoinggreat.com/icons/robber.png" alt="" aria-hidden="true"/></p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="https://primary-cdn.web3isgoinggreat.com/icons/wtf.png" alt="" aria-hidden="true"/></p></div><div><div><h2><a id="aleo-privacy-error"><span>&#34;Fully private&#34; Aleo blockchain accidentally sends out copies of users&#39; identification documents</span></a></h2><p><span>Aleo, a blockchain project that advertises it&#39;s a place for &#34;fully private applications&#34; with &#34;built-in privacy&#34; has just emailed private identification documents — including selfies and photographs of government identification cards — to the wrong users.<p>A user posted on Twitter that they had received an email with someone else&#39;s identification. &#34;That makes me wonder, if I have someone else&#39;s <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary#kyc" target="_blank">KYC</a> document, who else have you sent mine to?&#34; Another person replied to the thread that they had experienced the same thing.</p><p>Aleo acknowledged their screw-up on social media, claiming that only ten individuals were impacted, and that it had happened thanks to a &#34;copy/paste error in email metadata&#34;.</p></span></p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/zero-knowledge-chain-aleo-privacy-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>&#34;Zero-knowledge chain Aleo faces privacy leak issues&#34;</span></a><span>, <i>CryptoBriefing</i></span><span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240225150945/https://cryptobriefing.com/zero-knowledge-chain-aleo-privacy-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[archive]</a></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><p><img src="https://primary-cdn.web3isgoinggreat.com/icons/robber.png" alt="" aria-hidden="true"/></p></div><div><div><h2><a id="tornado-cash-exploit"><span>Crypto tumbler Tornado Cash suffers code exploit, putting funds at risk</span></a></h2><p><span>A community member of the Tornado Cash cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary#tumbler" target="_blank">tumbler</a> project has reported that malicious code was added to the Tornado Cash project on January 1, which has put at risk funds deposited into the service. According to the community member, a successful governance proposal two months ago resulted in a code change, but malicious JavaScript included in the change went unnoticed.<p>The code leaks private notes associated with deposits to a &#34;private malicious server&#34; owned by the person who initiated the code change.

Blast was created by the developers of the Blur NFT platform, and received funding from the Paradigm crypto VC.<p>The team behind Blast had even helped to promote the RiskOnBlast platform, tweeting from its official account that Blast was &#34;a new challenger&#34; in the ecosystem with &#34;undeniable&#34; potential.</p><p>On February 25, the platform drained more than 420 ETH (~$1.3 million) from more than 750 user wallets on their platform.
