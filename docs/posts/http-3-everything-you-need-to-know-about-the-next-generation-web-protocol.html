The protocol utilizes space congestion control over User Datagram Protocol (UDP).</p><h3>What is the relationship between HTTP, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3?</h3><p>While HTTP is really ‘HTTP-over-TCP’ and HTTP/2 might be described as ‘HTTP-over-TCP’ then HTTP/3 might be best described as ‘HTTP/2-over-QUIC’.</p><p>During the <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/black-hat" target="_blank">Black Hat</a> Asia 2020 virtual conference, Google engineer Nick Harper explained in some depth how QUIC and HTTP/3 compare to HTTP/2.</p><!-- Article End -->
