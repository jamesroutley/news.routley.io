            <span>Abstract:</span>This is a book about large language models. As indicated by the title, it primarily focuses on foundational concepts rather than comprehensive coverage of all cutting-edge technologies. The book is structured into four main chapters, each exploring a key area: pre-training, generative models, prompting techniques, and alignment methods. It is intended for college students, professionals, and practitioners in natural language processing and related fields, and can serve as a reference for anyone interested in large language models.
