<p>Hi!
This is my blog.</p>
<p>I am interested in alternative education, computing and the nervous system, healing and creativity.</p>
<p>I am presently working on a book about COVID, grief, and psychedelics. The temporary project name is &#34;My Love Song is My Battle Song.&#34;</p>
<p>I started two educational non-profits in the Boston area in my 20s (Camp Kaleidoscope / Kaleidoscope Education, and sprout.)</p>
<p>I worked a variety of jobs in tech - engineering, researcher at the Communications Group / Y Combinator Research and then led research at Coda.</p>
<p>I put out a series of papers and articles in places like Education Week, Psychology of Programming Interest Group, Technology Review, etc.</p>
<p>And lately I have been spending a lot of time with art making and diffusion models and trying to expand their use from ML enthuiast community to wide spread expression of art and the unconscious.</p>
<p>But really I&#39;m interested in the new paradigm of individual and collective possibility and hopefully I can interest you in that too.</p>
