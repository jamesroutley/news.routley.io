    <h1>I am drowning in mutes: The current Threads experience</h1>

While Instagram Reels has an uncanny ability to focus in on what you enjoy (to the point where staring at a tractor meme for too long has caused my feed to orbit farming Reels), Threads shares none of this ability. A blast of whatever content the platform has, with little thought.</p><p>It seemed that you could batter it into submission by mass muting anything unfunny - but then a new wave of celebrities and brands appears. Keeping up becomes an impossible challenge.</p><p>And thus, unless this situation resolves itself in another way, I will eventually grow tired of muting people, and leave the platform.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
