    <h1>RC Popup, Project I: A Ring II</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>This post is going to be quite short, just a little update on the ring project I talked about <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/RC_Popup,_Project_I:_A_Ring.html">yesterday</a> and a quick note on some other tinkerings. I’ve not been able to make much headway today, because I still get a lot of e-mails after my blog post on <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Carp.html">Carp</a> was on Hackernews and r/programming. I enjoy these messages, but they are taking a toll on my productivity at the moment.</p>
<p>I changed the torus form to be more ring-like, i.e. a band form. Now I’m experimenting with different thicknesses and sizes. For this I had to change the rendering from lines to curved vertices, which was fun, but didn’t feel very productive.</p>

Fig. 1: Now that looks like a ring!
</p>
<p>I then updated my <a href="http://veitheller.de/art/">art site</a> with some small projects, and prepared the next blog post on Carp, which will hopefully clear up some confusions that people had reading the first installment. I plan on getting it done by the end of this week. Similarly, the ring will hopefully be ready to be 3D printed in a few days, so I can actually see what it looks like in the real world and know whether I’ve painted myself into a corner.</p>
<p>I will keep you posted!</p>
