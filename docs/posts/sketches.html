    <h1>Sketches</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I&#39;ve been sticking to a sketching routine recently: every day I draw at least once face.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/img/bpY9hV60hE-1280.webp 1280w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Faces" height="985" src="https://macwright.com/img/bpY9hV60hE-1280.jpeg" width="1280"/></picture></p><p>Faces are different for me than any other kind of drawing. Somewhere in the process the face looks real enough for me to recognize it as a human being, if it&#39;s a good drawing. About 30% of what I draw looks like a face to me. Facial recognition does seem to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_perception#Neuroanatomy">a pretty innate, brain-region specific thing</a>, though I&#39;m not one to guess about neuroscience.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/img/dUtUTzyX9l-1280.webp 1280w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Faces" height="706" src="https://macwright.com/img/dUtUTzyX9l-1280.jpeg" width="1280"/></picture></p><p>Faces are an unforgiving subject. If I&#39;m drawing <a href="https://macwright.com/2025/09/11/dependencies-ship">a boat</a> or <a href="https://macwright.com/2023/10/01/seaplane">a seaplane</a> or <a href="https://macwright.com/2025/07/04/plants-set">some plants</a>, there&#39;s room for whimsy. A quirky rendering might be intentional or impressionistic. A poorly rendered face though just looks bad to me.</p><p>I&#39;ve been following <a href="https://www.21-draw.com/loomis-method/">the Loomis Method</a> for a lot of this. Facial proportions are pretty unintuitive: the eyes are <em>really, that low?</em> The method is very paint-by-numbers, but has helped with some beginner mistakes.</p><p><a href="https://rockynook.com/morpho/">Morpho books</a> have also been helpful for understanding how to draw an ear and a hand. I need to put more time into following those: they can be pretty intimidating at first.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/img/p5YqUrSZlS-1280.webp 1280w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Faces" height="986" src="https://macwright.com/img/p5YqUrSZlS-1280.jpeg" width="1280"/></picture></p><p>I&#39;m amazed by how changing small details dramatically shifts the personality of faces. Adding a single line under one eye can make a person look really tired, tilting an eye can change their expression dramatically. It&#39;s definitely some emotional sensitivity wiring that&#39;s on most of the time (and mine, I suspect, is weaker than most people&#39;s, my ability to read emotions is very bad) but being able to dial in different settings and see how I react to my own drawing is pretty interesting.</p><p>Going to attempt to stick with this for another few months, or maybe a year. It&#39;s not great so far, but fun to work on.</p></div></div>
