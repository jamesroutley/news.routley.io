It raised the credit to $7,500 on Wednesday. It also recently started offering free supercharging for 10,000 miles (16,093 kms) for vehicles delivered in December.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">The rare discounts follow a series of price hikes over the past couple of years by Tesla, which blamed supply chain disruption and inflation.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">Shares of Tesla ended down 8.9%, heading for <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-shares-tumble-track-worst-month-ever-2022-12-22/">their worst month ever</a> as worries grow over softening demand for electric cars and Chief Executive Elon Musk&#39;s distraction with Twitter, which he purchased in October.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">Tesla underperformed the broader market, which fell as data showing a resilient economy fueled worries over the Federal Reserve&#39;s path on hiking interest rates.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Musk said on Thursday that <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/elon-musk-says-he-will-not-sell-more-tesla-stock-another-two-years-2022-12-22/">he foresees the economy</a> will be in a &#34;serious recession&#34; in 2023 and demand for big-ticket items will be lower.</p><figure data-testid="image-0"><div data-testid="StatefulImage"><div data-testid="Image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="Body">A Tesla Model 3 is seen in a showroom in Los Angeles, California U.S. January 12, 2018.
