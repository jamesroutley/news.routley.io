    <h1>The best browser bookmarking system is files</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Along the years I have tested various browser bookmarking systems. </p>
<p>And for 10 years, I&#39;ve realised that the best bookmarking system is already built-in to most browsers (Firefox, Chrome), and that is:</p>
<p>files!</p>
<p>See the video, the drag-and-drop creates a <code>.url</code> shortcut file:</p>
<video controls="" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" width="60%"><source src="/files/browserbookmark.mp4"/></video>
<p>Just that. You drag and drop the URL to the Desktop or any folder.</p>
<p>No browser extension needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Want to delete/copy/move/rename a bookmark? Just delete/copy/move/rename the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to organize your bookmarks? Use directories in your filesystem, as usual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to join the bookmark to a work-in-progress in its dedicated directory? Just copy the file there, you&#39;ll have the bookmarks grouped with your other files:</p>
<p><img src="https://afewthingz.com/files/browserbookmark2.png" alt=""/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to backup all your bookmarks? They are just <code>.url</code> files in folders, so you can do a backup with all your other documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to sync them with other devices? Use the same sync system as your other documents (Syncthing is great)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to use your bookmarks in <em>multiple browsers</em>? No problem, you just drag and drop the bookmark file into the browser, and it opens automatically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to change your main browser? No need to do anything, you just keep the bookmark files (no need to &#34;export&#34; anything, no need to install a browser extension to save the bookmarks and/or convert them to another format...)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to search among your thousands of bookmarks? Just use your OS&#39;s search among all .url files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to add tags to your bookmarks? Just rename the file <code>Super bookmarking system.url</code> into <code>Super bookmarking system #productivity.url</code> and later you can search your bookmarks with tags, example query in your favorite OS&#39;s file search tool: &#34;bookmarking #productivity&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to do some data mining on your thousands of bookmarks? You can do it with any programming language, since a <code>.url</code> file is just that:</p>
<pre><code>[InternetShortcut]
URL=https://www.afewthingz.com/browserbookmark</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s it!</p>
<p>This has worked for decades with Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, and probably others, at least on Windows.</p>
<p>Remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>sadly, it doesn&#39;t work out of the box on Ubuntu + Firefox. Mozilla, please fix this :)</p>
</li>
<li>There has been a regression about this in recent versions of Firefox on Windows, you now have to modify your default Firefox shorcut to <code>firefox.exe -no-deelevate</code>. Please Mozilla, don&#39;t let this awesome feature die, this should work out of the box. It works on Chrome.</li>
