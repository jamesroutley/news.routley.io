    <h1>Harvard&#39;s response to federal government letter demanding changes</h1>

<p>Dear Members of the Harvard Community,</p>



<ul>
<li>nurture a thriving culture of open inquiry on our campus; develop the tools, skills, and practices needed to engage constructively with one another; and broaden the intellectual and viewpoint diversity within our community; </li>



<li>affirm the rights and responsibilities we share; respect free speech and dissent while also ensuring that protest occurs in a time, place, and manner that does not interfere with teaching, learning, and research; and enhance the consistency and fairness of disciplinary processes; and </li>



<li>work together to find ways, consistent with law, to foster and support a vibrant community that exemplifies, respects, and embraces difference. As we do, we will also continue to comply with <em>Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard</em>, which ruled that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act makes it unlawful for universities to make decisions “on the basis of race.” </li>
</ul>



<p>These ends will not be achieved by assertions of power, unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how we operate. The work of addressing our shortcomings, fulfilling our commitments, and embodying our values is ours to define and undertake as a community. Freedom of thought and inquiry, along with the government’s longstanding commitment to respect and protect it, has enabled universities to contribute in vital ways to a free society and to healthier, more prosperous lives for people everywhere. All of us share a stake in safeguarding that freedom. We proceed now, as always, with the conviction that the fearless and unfettered pursuit of truth liberates humanity—and with faith in the <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/">enduring promise that America’s colleges and universities</a> hold for our country and our world.</p>
