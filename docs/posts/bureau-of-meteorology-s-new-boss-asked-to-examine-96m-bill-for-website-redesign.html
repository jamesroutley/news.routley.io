after the revelations about the true cost of the website.</p><p>&#34;It is unbelievable a private consultancy was paid $78 million to redesign the website,&#34; Mr Littleproud said.</p><p>&#34;But then security and system testing meant that Australian taxpayers actually paid $96 million for what was nothing more than another Labor disaster,.</p><p>&#34;The seriousness of this cannot be understated. This isn&#39;t just about a clunky website, the changes actually put lives and safety at risk.</p><p>&#34;The new platform did not allow people to enter GPS coordinates for their specific property locations, restricting searches to towns or postcodes.</p><p>&#34;Families and farmers could not access vital, localised data such as river heights and rainfall information and this missing data created panic and fear across communities.</p><p>&#34;But now, the fact the BOM has been hiding the true cost of its white elephant and initially lying about the total figure is deeply concerning, considering that the BOM should be all about trust.&#34;</p></div></div>
