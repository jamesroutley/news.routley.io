      <p>Beth Benike, the owner of Busy Baby products in Minnesota, who has been speaking to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct88h1">the BBC World Business Express</a>, has said that “Oh my gosh, I feel that like a thousand-pound weight has been lifted off my chest.&#34;</p><p>“It&#39;s been devastating, to be honest.

So, I was forced to abandon my products in China for eight weeks, which led to an out-of-stock situation with loss of revenue.”</p><p>She says that she had let some of her employees go in the last year, and “I had to cash in my retirement. I have not been able to plan anything for my business.”</p><p>“If I had to add up the potential revenue lost and the revenue lost while we were out of stock because of the tariffs, it&#39;s probably close to a million dollars in revenue,” she told the BBC World Business Express.</p>

      <p>We just heard Trump speak in the wake of the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to strike down his sweeping tariffs plan. </p><p>Here&#39;s a recap of what he told reporters at the White House: </p><ul><li spacing="rich-text">
      Some of the first words we heard from Trump after he came to the podium were that the decision was <b>&#34;deeply disappointing&#34; </b>and that he was ashamed of &#34;certain members of the court for not having the courage to do what&#39;s right for our country&#34;
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      He thanked the justices who dissented - justices Thomas, Alito and Kavanaugh - for their &#34;strength and wisdom&#34; and criticised those who went against his tariff plan
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      The president accused the Supreme Court of being &#34;swayed by foreign interests&#34;, without providing any evidence
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      Trump said he&#39;s signing an executive order to<b> impose a 10% global tariff using Section 122</b>, which was created by the 1974 Trade Act
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      The president also said he would <b>use Section 301</b> as a means to impose tariffs
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
       He offered a glimpse into how he was reading the ruling saying it struck down a specific use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which according to the Supreme Court did not grant him the power to impose tariffs in the way he had claimed
    </li></ul>

      <p> Many businesses were already bracing themselves for a fight over
refunds.</p><p>And Trump just signalled that they will have one, warning that he expected the issue to be tied up in court for years.</p><p>Trade attorneys have said the government could simply set up
a process for firms to claim back their money – some $130bn so far, according
to the most recent government data.  Electronic
payments and receipts mean the procedure would not necessarily have to be
complicated.</p><p>But Trump’s comments suggest the White House does not intend
to give up the money quickly.</p><p>Since the majority’s decision was silent on the question of refunds, this matter is expected to go to the Court of International Trade. While courts
have authorised refunds before, those were much smaller in scale.  </p><p>The costs involved with litigating the issue mean many
smaller firms could get left out. </p>

      <p>Businesses don’t like paying tariffs. But for many
firms, an equally unnerving aspect of Trump’s tariff announcements last year were their
unpredictability. </p><p>That’s why even though Trump has made clear that tariffs
will remain in place, the Supreme Court decision will remain important.</p><p>He has said he will impose a 10% tariff using a different law, which gives him the power to put tariffs in place for 150 days, at which point Congress must step in. </p><p>But many of the other tariff tools at Trump&#39;s disposal have more established
processes – requiring investigations, notice and comment periods before going into effect.</p><p>That
gives firms time to plan - a silver lining that should stand.</p>

      <p>President Trump said the US will generate more money from his new 10% global tariff.</p><p>The White House plans to replace tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) - which the Supreme Court struck down - with new duties.</p><p>Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act allows the President to impose levies up to 15% for up to 150 days on imports from all countries before needing approval from Congress.</p><p>In anticipation of today, Erica York, Vice President of Federal Tax Policy at the Tax Foundation has crunched the numbers. By her calculations, the 10% tariffs on the same goods that faced the now illegal IEEPA tariffs would replace 56% of the revenue raised over 150 days. </p><p>Although she points out that if it is applied across the board with no exceptions, the new tariffs would raise more than IEEPA.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump started this press conference with an extended diatribe against the court, calling the justices who ruled against him a “disgrace” and “fools and lapdogs”.</p><p>The president had appointed two of the justices in the majority, and it’s clear that their decision cut particularly deep.</p><p>The president isn’t abandoning the fight, however. As expected, he said that he would attempt to reimpose tariffs using presidential authority available under other laws. He has not, however, spelt out the details as of yet. </p><p>Whatever those alternatives may be, they will likely take time to implement. In the meantime, the president is left licking his wounds as a key pillar of his economic and diplomatic policy has been eroded.</p>
