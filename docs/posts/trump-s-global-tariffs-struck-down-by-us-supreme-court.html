      <p>Businesses don’t like paying tariffs. But for many
firms, an equally unnerving aspect of Trump’s tariff announcements last year were their
unpredictability. </p><p>That’s why even though Trump has made clear that tariffs
will remain in place, the Supreme Court decision will remain important.</p><p>He has said he will impose a 10% tariff using a different law, which gives him the power to put tariffs in place for 150 days, at which point Congress must step in. </p><p>But many of the other tariff tools at Trump&#39;s disposal have more established
processes – requiring investigations, notice and comment periods before going into effect. That
gives firms time to plan - a silver lining that should stand. </p>

      <p>Shortly before ending the news conference, President Trump renewed his earlier attacks on the Supreme Court judges who ruled against him. </p><p>He is asked if he was surprised Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, who he nominated in his first term, ruled against his tariff powers and if he regrets nominating them.</p><p>&#34;I am,&#34; he says referring to being surprised by their ruling.</p><p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to say whether I regret. I think their decision was terrible. I think it is an embarrassment to their families, you want to know the truth, the two of them.&#34;</p>

      <p>President Trump said the US will generate more money from his new 10% global tariff.</p><p>The White House plans to replace tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) – which the Supreme Court today struck down –  with new duties.</p><p>Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act allows the president to impose levies up to 15% for up to 150 days on imports from all countries before needing approval from Congress.</p><p>In anticipation of today, Erica York of the Tax Foundation has crunched the numbers. By her estimation, the 10% tariffs announced today would replace around 56% of the revenue generated by tariffs under IEEPA.</p>

      <p>Trump is asked whether he was surprised by the Supreme Court ruling. </p><p>He says he was, and that he believed he could not lose, adding that he read the case law –  &#34;everything there is to read&#34; –  prior to the decision. </p><p>He calls the justices who made the decision &#34;political&#34; and wanting to be &#34;politically correct&#34;. He also accuses them of &#34;catering to a group of people in DC, maybe&#34;.</p><p>And with that, the US president wraps up his briefing. We&#39;ll bring you a recap of the key lines shortly. </p>

      <p>Trump is asked whether the Supreme Court judges who ruled against him are still invited to his State of the Union address next week, where he is expected to lay out his plans for the year to come.</p><p>He says the three justices who voted in favour of his tariffs are &#34;happily invited&#34; and the rest are &#34;barely invited&#34;. </p><p>&#34;Honestly, I couldn&#39;t care less if they come,&#34; he adds. </p>

      <p>Donald Trump started this press conference with an extended diatribe against the court, calling the justices who ruled against him a “disgrace” and “fools and lapdogs”.</p><p>The president had appointed two of the justices in the majority, and it’s clear that their decision cut particularly deep.</p><p>The president isn’t abandoning the fight, however. As expected, he said that he would attempt to reimpose tariffs using presidential authority available under other laws. He has not, however, spelt out the details as of yet. </p><p>Whatever those alternatives may be, they will likely take time to implement. In the meantime, the president is left licking his wounds as a key pillar of his economic and diplomatic policy has been eroded.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump began his surprise White House briefing by saying he finds the Supreme Court decision &#34;deeply disappointing&#34; and that foreign countries are celebrating – but won&#39;t be for long.</p><p>He has not backed away from tariffs and vows that he will use other mechanisms to get his way. Trump is clearly digging in, repeating his often-cited assertions that they are both good for the US economy and as a foreign policy tool. </p><p>I spend most of my professional life listening to Trump, often in the room. His tone today is different from usual, largely soft spoken.

      <p>It was a fairly quiet morning at the White House, even despite the news, with reporters wondering aloud when official reaction would come, and in what form. </p><p>We found out when we suddenly received word that Trump would be coming to the briefing room. </p><p>Within minutes, the White House was a hub of activity, with reporters rushing in, setting up cameras, and watching over their seats. It&#39;s already crowded. </p><p>When I came up to grab the BBC&#39;s seat, a White House staffer was affixing a presidential seal to the podium. </p><p>A last-minute presidential briefing is an extremely unusual occurrence, and shows just how significant the Supreme Court&#39;s decision is for the Trump White House. </p><p>The only other one that has taken place happened just days after Trump returned to office in January last year, when a plane collided with a helicopter over the Potomac River near Washington DC. </p>

      <p>The Supreme Court&#39;s tariff ruling today dealt Donald Trump a major setback on one of his signature economic issues. But it doesn&#39;t mean Trump&#39;s trade agenda will suddenly disappear overnight.</p><p>The Court ruled that the US president does not have the authority to levy sweeping global tariffs on any country, for any reason. Under the Constitution, that sort of power falls to Congress. But the ruling left in place some tariffs the US levied on specific goods from specific countries – offering the administration a roadmap to try to retool its tariffs policy.</p><p>In the past, Congress and the courts have given presidents leeway to impose tariffs on targeted goods, or for brief periods of time. For example, President Richard Nixon imposed a sweeping tariff on imports in 1971 to combat a currency crisis, but kept them in place for just four months. In 2003, President George W Bush imposed tariffs on steel imports and kept them in place for approximately nine months.</p><p>Had Trump followed that model closely, more of his tariffs may have survived legal challenges. The court ruling Friday may push the administration to revisit that approach, and look for ways to impose more targeted tariffs going forward.</p><p>Either way, Trump is unlikely to give up on an issue that has animated him for decades – since long before he ran for the White House. Trump has argued for years that the US needs an aggressive tariffs regime to compete with China and other economic rivals. He won&#39;t give that argument up easily, even if the Supreme Court just reined in his power to act alone on trade.</p>
