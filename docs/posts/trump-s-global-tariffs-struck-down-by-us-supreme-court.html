      <p>Trump is now taking questions from reporters. He&#39;s asked if he will seek additional action from Congress on tariffs. </p><p>&#34;No need to, it&#39;s already approved,&#34; he says, as the authorities exist under Section 232 and Section 301. </p>

      <p>Donald Trump began his surprise White House briefing by saying he finds the Supreme Court decision &#34;deeply disappointing&#34; and that foreign countries are celebrating – but won&#39;t be for long.</p><p>He has not backed away from tariffs and vows that he will use other mechanisms to get his way. Trump is clearly digging in, repeating his often-cited assertions that they are both good for the US economy and as a foreign policy tool. </p><p>I spend most of my professional life listening to Trump, often in the room. His tone today is different from usual, largely soft spoken. Many American observers expected his anger - which is clear - in more forceful language. </p><p>We have so far not heard much in terms of a specific &#34;Plan B&#34; for the administration&#39;s path forward. </p>

      <p>The Supreme Court&#39;s tariff ruling today dealt Donald Trump a major setback on one of his signature economic issues. But it doesn&#39;t mean Trump&#39;s trade agenda will suddenly disappear overnight.</p><p>The Court ruled that the US president does not have the authority to levy sweeping global tariffs on any country, for any reason. Under the Constitution, that sort of power falls to Congress. But the ruling left in place some tariffs the US levied on specific goods from specific countries – offering the administration a roadmap to try to retool its tariffs policy.</p><p>In the past, Congress and the courts have given presidents leeway to impose tariffs on targeted goods, or for brief periods of time. For example, President Richard Nixon imposed a sweeping tariff on imports in 1971 to combat a currency crisis, but kept them in place for just four months. In 2003, President George W Bush imposed tariffs on steel imports and kept them in place for approximately nine months.</p><p>Had Trump followed that model closely, more of his tariffs may have survived legal challenges. The court ruling Friday may push the administration to revisit that approach, and look for ways to impose more targeted tariffs going forward.</p><p>Either way, Trump is unlikely to give up on an issue that has animated him for decades – since long before he ran for the White House. Trump has argued for years that the US needs an aggressive tariffs regime to compete with China and other economic rivals. He won&#39;t give that argument up easily, even if the Supreme Court just reined in his power to act alone on trade.</p>

      <p>There is still a lot of uncertainty on how or if all US importers will get a tariff refund, but if they do, the cost to the US government could be huge.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/trade">the latest official data<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a>, US customs has collected over $130bn (£96.3bn) in import taxes from the the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).</p><p>Despite the ruling, economists have raised doubts about the likelihood of the US handing all of that money back. As Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh puts it, the refund process is likely to be a &#34;mess&#34;.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump has reacted to the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to strike down his tariffs, calling it a &#34;disgrace&#34;.</p><p>He made the remark while speaking at a meeting with state governors earlier this morning, a source tells me. </p><p> We have yet to hear from Trump directly, or from White House officials. Trump has repeatedly said he views tariffs are hugely important to the US economy, and they very much form a key part of his wider agenda.</p>

      <p>Trade lawyers are
cautioning that while the Supreme Court&#39;s ruling opens the door to tariff
refunds, businesses are still confronted with big questions about what form
that process might take.</p><p>Steve Becker, head
of law firm Pillsbury&#39;s international trade practice, tells the BBC that it will be up to
the Court of International Trade to sort out the implementation of the court&#39;s
ruling against Trump&#39;s tariffs.</p><p>The best thing for
businesses, Becker says, is if the government were to announce an
&#34;orderly&#34; procedure for obtaining refunds that does not require
filing a lawsuit. &#34;I think companies can be fairly confident that they&#39;ll
get their money back eventually. But how long it will take really is up to the
government,&#34; Becker said.</p><p>&#34;There
certainly will be a high volume and a lot of work involved,&#34; he adds.</p><p>But at the same
time, Becker says it&#39;s likely the Trump administration has a contingency
plan in place to impose tariffs through other authorities. That could mean, for
example, using a law that allows the president to put tariffs of up to 15% in place
for 150 days. He could also target specific countries or sectors.</p>

      <p>Republicans have not been uniform in their support of Trump&#39;s tariffs policies, with many facing pressure from their own constituents who have been feeling their impact. </p><p>This is particularly true of farm-state Republicans, whose local economies depend heavily on agricultural exports, and whom are among the hardest hit by retaliatory tariffs.</p><p>These retaliatory tariffs can lower commodity prices, reduce farm income and increase financial state in rural states.</p><p>On several occasions, we&#39;ve even seen some Republicans – symbolically –side with Democrats to attempt to reverse tariffs. </p><p>Agriculture is far from the only sector that has led to disagreements within the party. Among those who have voiced opposition is Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, who has argued that the tariffs have harmed bourbon distillers and car manufacturers based in his state.</p><p>“Consumers are paying higher prices across the board as the true costs of trade barriers fall inevitably on them,” he said in a statement last year. </p><p>&#34;Protectionists in Washington insist that the past several months have vindicated the policy of indiscriminate trade war against both close allies and strategic adversaries.
