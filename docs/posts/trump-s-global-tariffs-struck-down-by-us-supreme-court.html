      <p>Donald Trump has reacted to the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to strike down his tariffs, calling it a &#34;disgrace&#34;.</p><p>He made the remark while speaking at a meeting with state governors earlier this morning, a source tells me. </p><p> We have yet to hear from Trump directly, or from White House officials. Trump has repeatedly said he views tariffs are hugely important to the US economy, and they very much form a key part of his wider agenda.</p>

      <p>Trade lawyers are
cautioning that while the Supreme Court&#39;s ruling opens the door to tariff
refunds, businesses are still confronted with big questions about what form
that process might take.</p><p>Steve Becker, head
of law firm Pillsbury&#39;s international trade practice, tells the BBC that it will be up to
the Court of International Trade to sort out the implementation of the court&#39;s
ruling against Trump&#39;s tariffs.</p><p>The best thing for
businesses, Becker says, is if the government were to announce an
&#34;orderly&#34; procedure for obtaining refunds that does not require
filing a lawsuit. &#34;I think companies can be fairly confident that they&#39;ll
get their money back eventually. But how long it will take really is up to the
government,&#34; Becker said.</p><p>&#34;There
certainly will be a high volume and a lot of work involved,&#34; he adds.</p><p>But at the same
time, Becker says it&#39;s likely the Trump administration has a contingency
plan in place to impose tariffs through other authorities. That could mean, for
example, using a law that allows the president to put tariffs of up to 15% in place
for 150 days. He could also target specific countries or sectors.</p>

      <p>Republicans have not been uniform in their support of Trump&#39;s tariffs policies, with many facing pressure from their own constituents who have been feeling their impact. </p><p>This is particularly true of farm-state Republicans, whose local economies depend heavily on agricultural exports, and whom are among the hardest hit by retaliatory tariffs.</p><p>These retaliatory tariffs can lower commodity prices, reduce farm income and increase financial state in rural states.</p><p>On several occasions, we&#39;ve even seen some Republicans – symbolically –side with Democrats to attempt to reverse tariffs. </p><p>Agriculture is far from the only sector that has led to disagreements within the party. Among those who have voiced opposition is Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, who has argued that the tariffs have harmed bourbon distillers and car manufacturers based in his state.</p><p>“Consumers are paying higher prices across the board as the true costs of trade barriers fall inevitably on them,” he said in a statement last year. </p><p>&#34;Protectionists in Washington insist that the past several months have vindicated the policy of indiscriminate trade war against both close allies and strategic adversaries. But Kentuckians are especially well equipped to sort the bluster from the truth.”</p>

      <p>When Trump&#39;s April tariffs were first announced, many US businesses faced a handful of choices.</p><p>They could have moved some or all of their manufacturing to the US to avoid the import taxes, which is what Trump was hoping would happen, they could have passed on the cost to US consumers by raising prices, or they could have taken the cost hit themselves. They also could have done some combination of the three.</p><p>Whatever they have chosen to do, those same businesses will now need to decide whether to unmake those choices or stick with them.</p><p>There&#39;s freedom in being able to do that, but there is also uncertainty. And there&#39;s also ongoing uncertainty around whether they will be able to claw back any import taxes they have already paid. </p><p>As a general rule, businesses don&#39;t like uncertainty, which helps to<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c0l9r67drg7t?post=asset%3Ad6f5de57-e9fa-4a33-8f17-5056aaab7346#post"> explain the stock market reaction</a> in the US.</p>

majority – has struck down the legal justification for a large portion of the
so-called reciprocal tariffs, as well as measures brought in against Canada,
Mexico and China, ostensibly in response to the influx into the US of illegal
drugs such as fentanyl.</p><p>These import taxes were introduced under the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act. But the court ruled that the Act did not
authorise measures which were “unbounded in scope, amount and duration”.</p><p>However, this is not the only legal avenue the administration
has used to impose extra tariffs since Trump took office. There are other
laws which he could use to re-impose them if he wishes. </p><p>Given the president’s
clear enthusiasm for tariffs as a negotiating tool, we are unlikely to see a
big change in policy from the White House.</p><p>That said, those other methods may require congressional
approval or investigations by the US Department of Commerce – so would probably
take longer. It’s not yet clear what will happen in terms of refunds for
tariffs that have already been paid by US importers.</p><p>So while the ruling gives certainty in one sense – the president
cannot use this particular method to impose the tariffs he wants – it creates
uncertainty in other ways.</p>

      <p>From tearing down the White House&#39;s East Wing to capturing foreign leaders, this is not a president who is used to being told &#34;no&#34;.</p><p>Today, the Supreme Court&#39;s ruling that President Trump cannot legally use emergency powers to invoke reciprocal and country-specific tariffs derails his existing trade strategy.</p><p>But are we heading back to pre-Trump business as usual? Think again.</p><p>First, this invalidates only some of the additional tariffs President Trump has ordered since taking office last year.</p><p>After intense negotiations following Liberation Day, the average tariff rate countries faced on selling into America settled at around 15%. The Supreme Court decision has – in theory more halved that typical rate. But it remains above 6% - around three times the typical rate at the start of 2025 - due to tariffs imposed under different guises.</p><p>Second, importers may not actually see much change from current tariff levels – they have been agile in switching their supply chains away from the most highly tariffed countries.</p><p>But that and a desire to keep the money flowing in - has perhaps empowered the Trump fightback. &#34;We&#39;ll figure something out&#34; said the President pre-judgement.</p><p>It remains to be seen what will happen next.</p>

And nothing in the law that the president cited in his legal defence, the Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, delegated such sweeping powers to Trump.</p><p>The court’s decision represents a rare check on this president’s broad use of executive authority. A majority of the justices over the past year have shown a willingness to allow Trump to press ahead with his agenda, particularly on immigration and reshaping the federal government, even as legal challenges work their way through the court system.</p><p>This case, considered on an expedited basis, slams the door on one such expansive use of presidential authority.</p><p>With several other major cases involving controversial uses executive power – such as efforts to end birthright citizenship and to dismiss a Federal Reserve governor based on alleged improprieties – this may not be Trump’s only setback in the coming months.</p>
