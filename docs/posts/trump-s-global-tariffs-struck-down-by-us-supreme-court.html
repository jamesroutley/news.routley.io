      <p>The BBC is learning new details about Trump&#39;s plans to impose new tariffs that could, essentially, replace those struck down by today&#39;s ruling.</p><p>In a press conference after the decision was released, Trump said he planned to impose a new 10% global tariff under a never-used law known as Section 122, which gives him the power to put in place tariffs up to 15% for 150 days (at which point Congress must step in).</p><p>That, along with the ruling, raised questions about the fate of trade deals many countries struck with the Trump administration to lower tariffs last year.</p><p>Late Friday afternoon, a White House official said countries that previously reached trade deals with the US, including the UK, India and the EU, will now face the global 10% tariff under Section 122 rather than the tariff rate they had previously negotiated. Most UK goods had been subject to<a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10240/#:~:text=The%2010%25%20baseline%20tariff%20implemented,favourable%20terms%20on%20certain%20goods."> a 10% &#34;baseline&#34; rate.<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a></p><p>The Trump administration expects those countries to keep abiding by the concessions they had agreed to grant in the trade deals, the official added.</p>

      <p>In addition to all of the economic ramifications, the Supreme Court ruling today also has a deep impact on President Trump&#39;s foreign policy agenda.</p><p>Since returning to office more than a year ago, Trump has wielded tariffs to bolster American power on the world stage.</p><p>That tool has largely been directed at trade, of course as Trump used sweeping global tariffs - the same ones struck down by the court on Friday - to force the UK, India and other key trading partners to negotiate new deals with the US.</p><p>But Trump has also used tariffs, or the threat of them, to pressure other nations in ways not directly tied to the economy. The dispute over Greenland last month, for example, is a window into Trump&#39;s broader tariffs strategy.</p><p>Trump called for the US to seize Greenland, only to face stiff resistance from the territory, Denmark (which controls it), and allies across Europe. He responded by threatening to levy taxes on goods from nations opposing his plan. The threat forced Denmark and Greenland to the negotiating table. </p><p>And while that dispute remains unresolved, it showcased how Trump used tariffs as a tool in foreign affairs.</p><p>The tariff threat-as-diplomacy tool hasn&#39;t entirely gone away with this decision. But it is greatly diminished.</p>

      <p>For Canada, this Supreme Court ruling will, at first blush, seem like good news, even vindication for many Canadians who felt unfairly targeted by their closest trading partner.</p><p>But the ruling brings more uncertainty.</p><p>Currently, the vast majority of trade have been sheltered by the USMCA, a sweeping trilateral North American trade agreement, from the fentanyl-related tariffs that Trump imposed and which were part of the ruling.</p><p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has often said Canada is among the countries in the world with the lowest tariff rate due to the USMCA, although Canada is still feeling the pain of separate tariffs on goods from sectors like steel, autos and lumber.</p><p>With the US president making clear that he will find a replacement for the tariffs struck down by the court, the question is: What’s next?</p>

      <p>Diane Swonk, the chief economist at KPMG US, offers this about the prospect of the money collected through Trump&#39;s emergency powers tariffs will be refunded: “Unfortunately, I&#39;d say curb your enthusiasm, although I understand the desire for relief.</p><p>&#34;The reality is that the administration has been anticipating this and has warned that they will pull other levers to quickly reinstate any tariffs ruled illegal,&#34; she says. </p><p>Already, Trump has said he plans to instate 10% levies through another part of US trade law.</p><p>Speaking to the BBC World Business Express about the potential refund that businesses worldwide could seek, Swonk says: “The Supreme Court itself actually noted in their brief that the logistics of refunds are a mess and it will be very difficult to prove and be able to provide all the paperwork and the time involved.”</p><p>That means small and mid-sized businesses are not likely to see refunds.</p><p>Those who do &#34;will be the ones that can literally dot all their I&#39;s and cross all their T&#39;s on the paperwork&#34; and should expect to wait a while.</p><p>She also says that the &#34;other levers&#34; could be harder to reverse later on.</p><p>“So, there&#39;s an undercurrent to this that they&#39;re going to be using more statutory tariffs with investigations that, over time, could be harder to lift after they get implemented,&#34; she says.</p>

      <p>Crucially for the UK, this ruling doesn’t impact the deals the UK government has secured for the steel, aluminium, pharmaceuticals, autos, and aerospace sectors -  which represent most of our trade with the US.

For example, he could find a workaround to re-enact the tariffs he had imposed using his emergency powers via other legal means. There is also a question of potential refunds. But its US importers who pay the cost of the tariffs to US customs, although many UK firms will have had to absorb some or all the extra costs. </p><p>It could all get very complicated.As we wait to see what comes next, we should note that the government says it expects its privileged trading position with the US to continue. </p>

      <p>We just heard Trump speak in the wake of the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to strike down his sweeping tariffs plan. </p><p>Here&#39;s a recap of what he told reporters at the White House: </p><ul><li spacing="rich-text">
      Some of the first words we heard from Trump after he came to the podium were that the decision was <b>&#34;deeply disappointing&#34; </b>and that he was ashamed of &#34;certain members of the court for not having the courage to do what&#39;s right for our country&#34;
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      He thanked the justices who dissented - justices Thomas, Alito and Kavanaugh - for their &#34;strength and wisdom&#34; and criticised those who went against his tariff plan
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      The president accused the Supreme Court of being &#34;swayed by foreign interests&#34;, without providing any evidence
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      Trump said he&#39;s signing an executive order to<b> impose a 10% global tariff using Section 122</b>, which was created by the 1974 Trade Act
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      The president also said he would <b>use Section 301</b> as a means to impose tariffs
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
       He offered a glimpse into how he was reading the ruling saying it struck down a specific use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which according to the Supreme Court did not grant him the power to impose tariffs in the way he had claimed

      <p> Many businesses were already bracing themselves for a fight over
refunds.</p><p>And Trump just signalled that they will have one, warning that he expected the issue to be tied up in court for years.</p><p>Trade attorneys have said the government could simply set up
a process for firms to claim back their money – some $130bn so far, according
to the most recent government data.  Electronic
payments and receipts mean the procedure would not necessarily have to be
complicated.</p><p>But Trump’s comments suggest the White House does not intend
to give up the money quickly.</p><p>Since the majority’s decision was silent on the question of refunds, this matter is expected to go to the Court of International Trade. While courts
have authorised refunds before, those were much smaller in scale.  </p><p>The costs involved with litigating the issue mean many
smaller firms could get left out. </p>
