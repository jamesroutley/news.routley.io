    <h1>Decentralizing Distribution</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Guardian Project has been awarded a grant from the <a href="https://www.ffdweb.org/guardian-project-annoucement">Filecoin Foundation for
the Decentralized Web
(FFDW)</a> to work on
decentralizing veracity and distribution (DVD).  FFDW‚Äôs Mission is to
‚Äúensure the permanent preservation of humanity‚Äôs most important information
by stewarding the development of open source software and open protocols for
decentralized data storage and retrieval networks.‚Äù Filecoin is built on top
of IPFS, which is ‚Äú<a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/">a distributed system for storing and accessing
files</a>‚Äù.  The distribution
component of the FFDW-DVD project is focused on improving F-Droid‚Äôs free,
open, and decentralized mobile app ecosystem.  On top of the flagship
unified experience offered by this website and the F-Droid official app,
F-Droid provides all the pieces for anyone to create, build, remix, publish,
reproduce, redistribute and review mobile apps.</p>

<p>This is important to F-Droid users because it means that they are not locked
into F-Droid as the monopoly app provider.  The F-Droid community needs to
stay responsive to its users because it is possible to fork all of F-Droid
(okay, except for the signing keys üö´Œ®üìùüîëüòâ).  Decentralization is also
important because each user has specific needs and wishes that potentially
conflict with other users.  Many want only free software, but others are
willing to compromise in key places, and still others have strong privacy
needs that conflict with other users‚Äô favorite features.  Decentralized app
repositories provide users that flexibility without having to move away from
the main F-Droid infrastructure.</p>

<p>We share the concerns about the walled garden approach to app stores. While
their design may have been driven out of concern for security and
simplicity, they have become a source of unbridled control, censorship and
surveillance.  Smartphones are the primary computer for most and apps are
the central mobile tool.  Centralized, locked down phones keep the real
power of modern computing needlessly out of reach of most of the world‚Äôs
population.  The FFDW-DVD project will push F-Droid forward towards
realizing full support for customization, curation, mirroring, censorship
circumvention, and peer-to-peer sharing.  We can provide a more free and
less fragile solution for the sharing of capability and knowledge to all.
On top of that, this project will give us focused time to work on making our
processes run more efficiently and reliably.</p>

<p>IPFS and Filecoin are central to this mission.  IPFS has the potential to
provide the plumbing for the entire F-Droid ecosystem.  It is a
decentralized filesystem where files are accessible by their
<a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/hashing/">hash</a> compiled into a <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">Content
Identifier (CID)</a>.  That
means the unique signature of each file can be used to fetch that file from
IPFS, no matter where it is actually stored.  It can be stored on some
server farm or the other smartphone next to you when on a mountain top.  If
the IPFS storage is reachable and contains the CID you need, it can be
retrieved.  Internet is not required.  Additionally, if a file is important
to you, you can ‚Äú<a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/pin-files/">pin</a>‚Äù it in your
own IPFS storage or pay someone else to do it using Filecoin.  As long as
someone is interested in having a file publicly available, it can be
maintained in IPFS, even if the original creator has taken it down.</p>

<p>IPFS is working now, and services are using it, including
<a href="https://blog.archive.org/2021/04/01/filecoin-foundation-grants-50000-fil-to-the-internet-archive/">archive.org</a>.
But there is much work to be done before it really can replace current web
hosting and file distribution methods.  That means we will integrate IPFS in
a hybrid approach, and we are already reporting our experiences upstream to
help improve IPFS.  F-Droid already supports repositories and mirrors, and
IPFS will plug right into those channels.  This gives the F-Droid ecosystem
another layer of resiliency and flexibility.</p>

<p>Since the ‚Äúdecentralized web‚Äù includes all sorts of things, it is important
to also mention things that we will
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/06/the_dark_equation_of_harm/">not</a> be
doing with this grant.  We are not looking at NFTs, blockchain, DAOs, smart
contracts or related aspects of
‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a>‚Äù.</p>

<h2 id="funded-work">Funded work</h2>

<p>This work is focused on strengthening F-Droid foundations while enabling
repositories to be hosted on decentralized storage, while spreading our
platform as a viable alternative for all kinds of users and organizations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Break out and overhaul core client logic around publishing and consuming
repositories.</li>
  <li>Make client logic into libraries to make it easy to embed repositories in
any app that needs it.</li>
  <li>Add support for mirroring repositories onto both IPFS and Filecoin.</li>
  <li>Add support in F-Droid client to use mirrors and repositories hosted on
IPFS and Filecoin.</li>
  <li>Improve F-Droid ‚Äúwhite labeling‚Äù.</li>
  <li>Enhance F-Droid client‚Äôs existing ‚Äúnearby‚Äù and ‚Äúapp swap‚Äù capabilities,
including utilizing libp2p-based communication.</li>
  <li>Improve the capability and usability of publishing and distributing
multimedia content (documents, presentations, photos, videos, map files,
and more).</li>
  <li>Update F-Droid‚Äôs RepoMaker tool (for easy ‚Äúpoint and click‚Äù curation and
publishing of app repos) and add support for IPFS publishing.</li>
  <li>Expand access to F-Droid repositories to non-Android devices and the
mobile web (progressive web apps, content).</li>
  <li>Set up a full archive of the f-droid.org repository on IPFS.</li>
  <li>Expand outreach and assistance to software developers, media organization,
tech companies and more to promote adoption of the F-Droid platform for
their software, content and devices (example: Mozilla could easily run a
Mozilla app store that includes all the Mozilla channels: releases,
nightlies, etc.  They could also include a curated collection of
reproducibly built apps that Mozilla approves of.  Someone who trusts
Mozilla can then easily choose to only have access to the Mozilla-curated
app store)</li>
</ul>

<p>Our first priority is splitting out the core client pieces as standalone
libraries. We will take this opportunity to modernize the index format and
ensure it works well with IPFS.  That effort is tracked using the <code>index-v2</code>
label on
<a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/-/issues?scope=all&amp;state=opened&amp;label_name[]=index-v2">issues</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;state=opened&amp;label_name[]=index-v2">merge
