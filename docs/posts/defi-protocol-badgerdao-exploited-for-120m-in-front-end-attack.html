<li>DeFi protocol BadgerDAO was exploited earlier today for $120 million.</li>
<li>It appears that its front end was compromised and users were tricked into making unwanted transactions.</li>

According to security researchers PeckShield, $120.3 million was stolen from users of the protocol.</p>
<p>BadgerDAO is a DeFi protocol focused on providing yield for bitcoin. The idea is that you bridge your bitcoin over onto a smart contract platform like Ethereum, as wrapped bitcoin, which you can then use within DeFi applications. BadgerDAO provides a variety of vaults where users can park their wrapped bitcoin and earn yields depending on the yield generation strategies used by the vaults.</p>
<p>&#34;<span>Badger has received reports of unauthorized withdrawals of user funds. As Badger engineers investigate this, all smart contracts have been paused to prevent further withdrawals,&#34; BadgerDAO tweeted today, confirming the exploit.</span></p>
<p>PeckShield documented the variety of assets stolen in the hack, which range from tokens like wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) and convex finance (CVX) to more complicated tokens like &#34;<span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;;font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">ibbtc/sbtcCRV-f</span>.&#34; Many of the tokens represent assets held in a vault, meaning they can be redeemed for multiple tokens with varying values — making it harder to total the amount of funds stolen.</p>
<p>One user had around 900 bitcoin ($50.8 million) worth of tokens stolen in a <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x951babdddbfbbba81bbbb7991a959d9815e80cc5d9418d10e692f41541029869">single transaction</a>. Another lost $5 million worth of tokens <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x951babdddbfbbba81bbbb7991a959d9815e80cc5d9418d10e692f41541029869">in one go</a>.</p>
<p>The front end to the BadgerDAO website was reportedly acccessed, according to comments in the project&#39;s Discord channel, and used to intercept transactions. One admin said it appears that an API key for Cloudflare was compromised.</p>
<p>While protocols like BadgerDAO are decentralized and can be interacted with directly, it requires specialized knowledge to do so. Most users will use a front end like the BadgerDAO website (although alternative front ends can be used). But this does have an element of risk: if the front end gets comprised, as in this case, then it can lead to loss of funds.</p>
