    <h1>Do judges give out tougher sentences when hungry? A study too good to be true</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How rational are human beings? Back in 2011, a now-famous study of eight Israeli judges claimed to show that the answer is: not very.</p><p>Researchers observed the daily decisions made on parole boards for prisoners who’d committed a variety of different crimes. At the start of sessions, the judges tended to give about 65 per cent of cases a positive decision – that is, they granted the prisoner’s request for parole. But as the session wore on – and, the researchers argued, as the judges got further from their last meal – the decisions became more and more negative.</p><p>Indeed, just before each of the three daily food breaks, the percentage of positive decisions dropped to effectively zero. It then jumped back up to around 65 per cent after the judges had had a break and something to eat.</p><p>The researchers claimed that it wasn’t that the judges were seeing the less hardened criminals in the earlier sessions; it really seemed to be that hunger or tiredness was leading them to become much harsher in the way they made their decisions.</p><p>It’s a nice, easily-graspable story, and a perfect example of, to use the title of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1018033108">the paper that reported the study</a>, “extraneous factors in judicial decisions”. That is, it supports the idea that, try as we might, we can’t make our rational minds immune to non-rational feelings.</p><p>That’s why it was of interest to the psychologist <a href="https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/money/relationship-health-and-wealth-complicated-debate-1711751?ico=in-line_link">Daniel Kahneman</a>, whose 2011 bestselling book on human (ir)rationality, <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, described the “disturbing” study and made it into a famous example. It’s been popular in the academic world, too: according to the Google Scholar search engine, the study has been cited by more than 1,700 other research articles.</p><p>But with all that attention has come scrutiny. Can it really be the case that judges make such wildly different decisions due to entirely irrational factors? <a href="http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2017/07/impossibly-hungry-judges.html">One critical analysis</a> made what is, on reflection, a very good point: the study has an effect that seems too big to be realistic. If it was really the case that hunger affected our brains this much, “our society would fall into minor chaos every day at 11:45”.</p><p>Another <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/judgment-and-decision-making/article/irrational-hungry-judge-effect-revisited-simulations-reveal-that-the-magnitude-of-the-effect-is-overestimated/61CE825D4DC137675BB9CAD04571AE58">clever point</a> is that the results might be due to the judges’ time management: they might not have wanted to deal with a particularly complex, difficult case just before a break, and so pushed it to begin after they came back.</p><p>More complex cases are also plausibly more likely to be given a positive decision, perhaps because they include consideration of lots of mitigating factors. That might be why it looks like so many positive decisions come just after the break.</p><p>So there are good reasons to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/german-law-journal/article/beware-the-lure-of-narratives-hungry-judges-should-not-motivate-the-use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-law/734C6F05568636FE09A26D1C4D52D627">be sceptical</a> of that original, well-publicised “hungry judges” study. But here’s something else to consider: an entirely new hungry-judges study has just appeared – and it finds the <em>opposite</em> effect.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.tse-fr.eu/sites/default/files/TSE/documents/doc/wp/2022/wp_tse_1393.pdf">new research</a> uses a huge dataset spanning decades’ worth of court decisions from thousands of judges in India and Pakistan. Instead of watching the decisions made throughout the day – which is vulnerable to the time-management problem described above – it takes advantage of the fact that, for one month each year, all the Muslim judges in those countries are fasting for Ramadan. And not just that, but because <a href="https://inews.co.uk/topic/ramadan?ico=in-line_link">Ramadan</a> lasts from dawn to sunset, because it can happen in different seasons from year to year, and because different places have slightly different day lengths due to their geographical location, some judges experienced longer fasts than others. The researchers were able to use this variation to ask whether longer fasts – and thus, presumably, greater hunger – led to any differences in judicial decisions.</p><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2500" height="1666" src="https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SEI_149883019-1.jpg?w=760" alt="" srcset="https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SEI_149883019-1.jpg 2500w, https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SEI_149883019-1.jpg?resize=140,92 140w, https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SEI_149883019-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SEI_149883019-1.jpg?resize=380,253 380w, https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SEI_149883019-1.jpg?resize=760,506 760w, https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SEI_149883019-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SEI_149883019-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px"/><figcaption>Muslim devotees pray before breaking their Ramadan fast in Peshawar (Photo: Abdul Majeed/AFP via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p>And it did… sort of. The headline finding reported in the study is that the judges were about 10 per cent more likely to acquit a defendant for every additional hour of fasting they experienced. Yes, that’s right: <em>more</em> likely to acquit. So, in direct contrast to the study from Israel, the hungrier the judge was in this study, the more lenient they were. For non-Muslim judges, there was no difference during Ramadan, probably because they were just eating as normal.</p><p>They also had data on successful appeals: that is, when a judge’s decision is later reversed by another judge. They found that the judges who fasted longer for Ramadan were less likely to have successful appeals made against their decisions. The researchers interpreted this as showing that the fasting actually made the judges <em>better</em> at reasoning – perhaps they were better able to get on top of all the facts of the case and make a decision that was less likely to be overturned.</p><p>Why would hunger make you better at making good decisions? The authors speculate that the physiological benefits of fasting, which have been looked at in <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMra1905136">a few studies</a>, might have improved the judge’s thinking abilities during Ramadan. It’s also possible that the religious significance of Ramadan changed the way they thought about the defendants they were judging.</p><div id="color-context-related-article-2259890" data-post-id="2259890"><div><h2>Related Article</h2><a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/a-huge-proportion-of-medical-trials-fail-to-report-their-results-a-new-uk-law-might-change-that-2259890?ico=related_article_inline" title="A huge proportion of medical trials fail to report their results – a new UK law might change that"><figure><img src="https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-182126875.jpg?w=640&amp;h=360&amp;crop=1" alt="A huge proportion of medical trials fail to report their results – a new UK law might change that"/></figure></a></div></div><p>However, the data – especially for the main result regarding leniency – are quite noisy: there’s a lot going on in the dataset and the effects are quite hard to discern. Statistically, this means that the statistical tests the authors used to tell apart real effects from noise tended to give quite borderline results for the Ramadan effects. Not only that, but there are some unexpected results, such as the fact that the additional leniency from Ramadan seemed, in India at least, to last for several months <em>after</em> the fasting was all done.</p><p>Whether or not the effect is real in these data, we have definitely learnt one thing: the effect of hunger on judge’s decisions is an awful lot smaller than we thought back in 2011.</p><p>If the effect had been of comparable size to that in the older study, there would have been absolutely no problems telling it apart from noise in the newer one. But there’s nothing in the Ramadan study that comes close to the dramatic effect seen in the Israeli judges study, which now looks as if its results might’ve been due to some kind of error or oversimplification.</p><p>With hindsight, it does seem far more plausible that feelings like hunger would exert a small influence, if any at all, on our decisions. Certainly, if the effect is true we’d want to know about it – and mitigate it, since judicial decisions are supposed to be made purely on the merits of the case. But if hunger was making such a big difference to our justice system, we wouldn’t need studies – we’d know about it already.</p><p>And yet, millions of people read an uncritical summary of the hungry judges study in Kahneman’s book; very many more have read about it again in his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/03/noise-by-daniel-kahneman-olivier-sibony-and-cass-sunstein-review-the-price-of-poor-judgment">more recent bestseller</a>. They “learned” that humans are so irrational that even hunger pangs can have an enormous effect on major, serious decisions made about people’s lives and liberty. But if the Ramadan study shows anything, it shows that the era of simple, eye-catching stories about people’s psychology is over. After all, how likely was it that something like human rationality was ever going to be straightforward?</p></div></div>
