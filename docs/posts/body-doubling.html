						<div><h3>“WHAT IS BODY DOUBLING?</h3>
<p>In simple terms, it’s merely being in the same room with another person who is having trouble getting things done on their own. As a body double, you don’t need to help or even say anything. All you need to do is just be there in the room, and through some invisible power, the other person is able to focus and finish their work. Buddies can do this over the phone for hours, simply keeping the line open—sometimes speaking, but mostly just silently being there.”</p>

There were times when <b>just being in proximity</b>, not advising, sorting, or strategizing, brought <b>clarity and focus</b> to the client. I <em>felt</em> it. I knew the client felt it, too. This phenomenon of <em><b>just being there</b></em>, which David first described out loud, I named <b><em>the body double</em></b>.”</span></p></div>

				<p><span>It is common for neurodivergent folks to benefit from having another person’s presence available while they work. This way we can get things done simply by being around others. Even virtually this works, and this site is meant to be a way to find a partner to body double with, so we can remain productive!</span></p>
