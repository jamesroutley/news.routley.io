Yes. Ok, but did they think it would be deals this huge and with multiple companies? NO!  In fact, if you go back and read reporting on Sam Altman’s now infamous trip to South Korea on October 1st, even just </span><strong><u><span>mere hours </span></u></strong><span>before the massive deals with Samsung and SK Hynix were </span><em><span>simultaneously </span></em><span>signed</span><strong><span> – </span></strong><span>most reporting simply mentioned vague reports about Sam talking to Samsung, SK Hynix, TSMC, and Foxconn. But the reporting at the time was soft, almost dismissive — “exploring ties,” “seeking cooperation,” “probing for partnerships.” Nobody hinted that OpenAI was about to swallow </span><strong><u><span>up to 40% of global DRAM output</span></u></strong><strong><span> </span></strong><span>– even on morning before it happened!
