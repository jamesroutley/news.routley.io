            <p>
            Right after I get admitted, I inform Professor that I also have a full-time
            job. He insists that we must start working right away. I quit as a result and
            instantly breathe a refined air. I am now a scientist! A week later I approach
            Professor and let him know I&#39;m ready for work.
            </p>

            <p>
            &#34;Ready for what?&#34; he greets me as though our previous conversation didn&#39;t
            happen. I remind him that he&#39;s my PhD supervisor and that, at his proposal, we
            are studying the effects of electromagnetic fields on patients with carotid
            stent implants. &#34;There is nothing for you to do at the University, you can
            stay home for now,&#34; he tells me. Is he really serious? Does he want me to do
            research from bed? I insist on reading materials related to our field of
            research. I want to start right away. But he can&#39;t recommend any.
            </p>

            <p>
            My first day of research is over. It&#39;s autumn 2009. I spend the following days
            of my academic life oversleeping and strolling the city parks. I actually
            enjoy this newfound freedom from the alarm clock. I think, not without a
            certain longing, of my former factory colleagues. How we used to laugh at the
            stupidest of things, how it all felt like a big family. But I have a new life
            now. An intellectual one.
            </p>

            <p>
            A few weeks go by. No word from Professor. It&#39;s exhausting to conduct research
            like this. I need some color. I approach Professor again and ask for basic
            research equipment, &#34;I need an office, Professor,&#34; I begin, and, after a short
            while, I raise my stakes, &#34;And a computer, too!&#34;  I&#39;ve gone too
            far. &#34;Everybody is happy around here, except you!!!&#34; he snaps at me. I get a
            feeling that I&#39;m going nowhere with Professor.
            </p>

            <p>
            I approach the Head of Department. The Head listens carefully for my
            complaints and kindly informs me he doesn&#39;t mingle in Professor&#39;s business. It
            is up to my advisor to decide where the resources are allocated within his
            team. A nice way of deflecting responsibility.
            </p>

            <p>
            The Faculty&#39;s Dean doesn&#39;t give a damn either but I think he wants to avoid
            even more troubles seeing that I&#39;m so stubborn. I soon receive an email from
            Professor as a result. He decides to offer me an office and a computer. Two
            months wasted. Even so, I celebrate my first academic victory.
            </p>

            <p>
            &#34;Grab a computer and follow me,&#34; Professor instructs me a few days later. I
            can barely hide my enthusiasm. We take the stairs to the first floor. Then
            ground floor. Then basement. &#34;Almost there,&#34; I hear Professor in the
            darkness. After two more turns he opens a big door and hands me over the
            keys. My office is a rather spacious but austere room in the University&#39;s
            basement. My initial enthusiasm is fading. There&#39;s a simple desk with a basic
            chair at one end and a small, too high to reach window at the other. The walls
            are immaculately white. A hospital-style metal locker where Professor keeps his
            valuables under key completes the picture. 
            </p>

            <p>
            &#34;Doctoral Studies in Engineering Sciences for Developing the Knowledge-Based
            Society&#34; is the name of our project. It pays me, and approximately one hundred
            other colleagues of mine, all PhD candidates, our €500/month scholarships, or
            about the average wage. It&#39;s one project from among the four thousand projects
            sponsored by the European Union&#39;s &#34;Operational Program for Human Resources
            Development.&#34; This grandiose program, with an available budget of €5 billion,
            aims to &#34;develop the human capital and increase competitiveness by bringing
            education and life-long learning in sync with a modern, flexible and inclusive
            labor market and increase future opportunities for 1.650.000 people.&#34; Yes,
            those are millions, 15.000 of which are to become PhD students! The Government
            says so, I it as fact.
            </p>

            <p>
            For my part, I have to publish at least three scientific papers, present my
            research at one international conference and successfully defend my thesis in
            public. I have exactly three years at my disposal. If I fail, I have to return
            my scholarship in full. It&#39;s also up to me to rejoin the labor market and take
            care of my future, possibly as a teaching assistant here, at the
            University. So I take things seriously and go to work each morning. I learn
            and labor as hard as I can.
            </p>

            <p>
            I begin with the documentation phase and I read, among others, a very detailed
            series of experiments: human subjects placed in anechoic chambers with all
            kinds of electromagnetic fields directed at them. They measure changes in
            sweat rate, breathing rate, exhaled humidity, body temperatures, blood
            pressure and everything one can imagine. They try to figure out how the body
            responds and adapts to such an external stimulus.
            </p>

            <p>
            I, for my side, have to see what happens inside the human neck artery when an
            implanted stent heats up under the influence of electromagnetic fields. How
            does the body react and compensate for such a temperature increase, if there
            is one? I have things to discover. But I also have zero lab equipment. Not
            even a digital thermometer, let alone medical equipment of the kind I would
            need. The whole medical engineering&#39;s lab, the one I took my computer from, is
            a room twice the size of my basement with ten desktop computers in it, a
            blackboard, a small window blocked by another building and an extra door for a
            special room: Professor&#39;s own office.
            </p>

            <p>
            Critically, I do not even get to see or touch a real stent. We don&#39;t have
            any. There are no interactions with patients, no collaboration with doctors
            and no conversations with other engineers from our University. I&#39;m alone in my
            office. I&#39;m not sure what people do around here. When the whole Department
            gathers around, I hear professors complaining about &#34;kids these days&#34; but zero
            technical discussions and hardly any interest in scientific topics. We are
            one-man teams, each working in their only little basements, so to speak.
            </p>

            <p>
            Professor reassures me that computer simulations are enough for our study. So
            I try to find software licenses plus realistic computer models for my stents
            and human heads. They all cost money and are hard to find. To develop them
            from scratch is outside my specialty. Ideally, I should understand a bit of
            human biology, too, but that&#39;s again outside my specialty. I wonder at this
            point if I actually have a specialty. What makes me qualified to approach
            these issues? Why would my &#34;discoveries&#34;, born out of such meager
            possibilities, have any relevance for science?
            </p>

            <p>
            I don&#39;t lack motivation, though. I try to get a license for the €20k per year
            software we&#39;re using. It proves to be another catacombic adventure. The
            company offers two free licenses per public institution. I ask Professor for a
            license, but &#34;There aren&#39;t any left,&#34; he informs me. &#34;Don&#39;t we have two?&#34; I
            insist. &#34;Well, yes, but one license is on my laptop, which I always carry with
            me, and the other is on my office computer,&#34; he replies. I ask permission to
            his office to run some simulations from time to time, but &#34;No, my office is
            closed and only I have the key.&#34; I conclude Professor has a terrible fondness
            for locks and keys. I drop it. I&#39;m not sure what he does with two
            licenses. Maybe he sells them on the black market? Maybe Professor is a
            gangster? Who knows.
            </p>

            <p>
            One of my colleagues who is pursuing his PhD in the same Department under a
            different professor and a similar area of research, with whom I only cross
            paths when our blood pressure runs too high, happens to also work for a public
            institution. He applies for the two free licenses and is generous enough to
            offer me one.
            </p>

            <p>
            Another victory. But I&#39;m fed up with these victories. It&#39;s exhausting to fight
            all these absurd battles. My time is running out. I have to write some papers
            soon. I accept my fate. I accept I&#39;m not gonna be a scientist the way I&#39;ve
            imagined more than a year ago. I don&#39;t see any future for me here at the
            University. As a result, I simplify things tremendously. I draw a big sphere
            and pretend it&#39;s a human head, I place a long metallic cylinder inside it and
            pretend it&#39;s a real stent and I place a simple antenna close by. Anything more
            complicated than this crashes my toy computer. I soon realize that I play
            scientist like kids play cop with water pistols.
            </p>

            <p>
            I get to publish my first paper in this way. I&#39;m actually quite proud of it,
            given the circumstances. I actually start to enjoy writing. I put down my
            colleague as a co-author as a thank you for lending me the license. We&#39;ve
            learned this trick from the professors who do it all the time with their
            books, papers and conferences. They are required, just as we are, to publish
            and look active in the community per their contract with the University.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Out of curiosity, I start reading our school&#39;s newspaper, as my colleague
            calls our University&#39;s scientific journal. I soon spot inconsistencies. The
            wording is in plain, boring language with long introductions repeating the
            same generalities and facts known to all. But the style changes unexpectedly
            sometimes. I search these peculiar phrases online and my intuition is
            confirmed. Unacknowledged commandeering of intellectual labor via
            indiscriminate copy and paste practices. Plagiarism, in short. I find dozens
            of such instances. I see the name of our Head in there, too. I try to raise
            awareness for a month or two. Nobody gives a damn.
            </p><p>

            I stop reading the school&#39;s newspaper and concentrate on publishing my other
            papers instead. They are nothing more than variations on the first paper with
            different titles and different pictures. I let my computer run overnight and
            invent slightly different simulation scenarios and I underline different
            aspects of my results in each paper. After this, I take a more relaxed
            approach regarding my scientific pursuits, enjoy the show around me
            instead and stop giving a damn about Professor from now on.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            I notice the Head is emphasizing the &#34;academic dress code&#34; all the time. He
            even publishes an official Department guideline on this topic pressing us all
            to read it. I notice professors are always addressing each other formally even
            in informal settings, though they&#39;ve been acquainted for years. This title
            caries great importance here. I myself make a blunder in this respect when I
            visit Professor&#39;s office one day for some official papers. I ask if he&#39;s
            around but I refer to him by his family name only. I get admonished for
            skipping the &#34;professor&#34; part. I apologies, add the missing title and address
            the question again. &#34;No, Professor is not here!&#34; comes the reply abruptly.
            </p>

            <p>
            Our Head both informs and threatens us, &#34;Per the Department guidelines, every
            PhD candidate is required to teach for one semester. Find yourselves a seminar
            or a lab or I&#39;ll pick one for you.&#34; It so happens that I get friendly with an
            electronics department&#39;s professor. He asks me to be his teaching assistant. I
            inform the Head with great pleasure about this development and he, in turn,
            informs me with great satisfaction that &#34;I do not give this position to PhD
            candidates.&#34; I insist, but in vain. I get used to insisting in vain. I get
            used to failing to figure out how this whole clusterfuck works. One colleague
            is appointed to teach C++ by the Head. &#34;You know C++?&#34; I ask enthusiastically,
            as I am looking to become a software engineer myself at this point. &#34;I don&#39;t,&#34;
            she informs me, &#34;but there&#39;s enough time until Monday to learn it.&#34; It&#39;s
            Friday, the last day of my teaching career.
            </p>

            <p>
            Professor becomes my hero for a short time during a Department meeting. He
            insists that the design of high-voltage power lines is not actually a subject
            for his medical students. He wants more biology and medical related courses,
            instead. I truly believe in his vision. My mouth is wide open. But the Head
            again masterfully defends his position insisting on the necessity of assigning
            the minimum required number of hours per semester to each member of our
            Department, per the University guidelines. Nobody backs up my hero, not even
            he himself. The next topic on the agenda is the training of all our staff in
            the arts of digital blackboards &#34;to help improve the teaching experience.&#34;
            </p>

            <p>
            I&#39;m sinfully enjoying myself. What else do they do around here? Mrs. S. is our
            Department&#39;s team assistant. She&#39;s near retirement age and lives up in the
            attic. We visit her monthly to physically sign our presence in the attendance
            register. Sometimes she scolds us for signing in the wrong place, &#34;That was a
            public holiday! You didn&#39;t work then, did you?!&#34; There is no &#34;Sir&#34; nor
            &#34;professor&#34; with her. We are inhabiting a prestigious institution of higher
            learning, otherwise she would certainly call us morons. I&#39;m wondering at the
            inefficiency on relying on handwritten notebooks for timekeeping. This
            Technical University has a Computer Science department, after all. But things
            are as they should be around here. There are many advantages to the analog
            methods. For instance, we avoid software bugs so this method is more precise,
            it fosters social interactions so it is more humane, we avoid proprietary
            software so users have complete control to modify the source code. We turn up
            once a month, sign and then we&#39;re free to do whatever. The Professor has given
            me the correct advice on that first day.
            </p>

            <p>
            The only constant human presence in the whole building during the warm summer
            days is the cleaning lady. I befriend her and we talk each morning. She
            provides me with paper towels and liquid soap for &#34;When you might need it.&#34;
            Summer is vacation for both students and teachers, after all. From time to
            time I meet a stray professor in the hallways and they tell me I do a good
            job, always working, always studying, always present. Then, they excuses
            themselves with &#34;I have to change my car&#39;s windshield&#34; and other such
            important matters and then disappear for days or weeks on end.
            </p>

            <p>
            There&#39;s a big park with a lake nearby and a small river passes just behind the
            building. I often take small brakes from my academic life and stroll
            aimlessly. I sometimes watch the little fishes from the nearby bridge
            gathering in the shade of the willow trees. A kid approaches me one day, &#34;Did
            you see the big one?&#34; We chat a little. That&#39;s how I spend my
            days.
            </p>

            <p>
            With three months left, I send Professor my thesis. Days later, he warmly
            congratulates me, &#34;You are an embarrassment to our city!&#34; I stand
            alarmed. &#34;Yes, you are ruining the prestige of our University!&#34; I move closer.
            He points out a paragraph in my thesis where &#34;almost impossible&#34; is heavily
            underlined in red. &#34;Something is either possible or impossible,&#34; he mocks me
            with a noticeable grin on his face. I update the offending sentence. I also
            fix a few typos in the following week and rephrase some paragraphs which were
            not to his liking. He eventually approves it. I present it in front of the
            whole Department, the last step before facing the official commission. It gets
            approved.
            </p>

            <p>
            My celebration is cut short a few days later. For some reason, it is of the
            utmost importance to have an actual, real-life experiment to confirm our
            theoretical results. &#34;We can&#39;t present a theoretical thesis, we&#39;re a Technical
            University,&#34; Professor accuses me. I actually agree with him, though I have no
            soul left in this endeavor. How did he come up with this idea? I don&#39;t
            know. He probably got admonished by some higher-up. It was fine without it,
            the Department approved it, the Head approved it, it was ready for
            defending. Now it isn&#39;t. I shrug and accept it as another fact I can&#39;t
            understand nor influence.
            </p>

            <p>
            Professor finds a public institution to lend us their watermelon-sized
            anechoic chamber for two hours. We visit the supermarket one morning to buy
            pork chops for the human head. I want to bring to Professor&#39;s attention that
            we&#39;re studying a dynamic system and not dead meat. But it&#39;s autumn 2012
            already and the parks are in full color. It&#39;s way too late for any dialogue. I
            pull out a small plastic bag with a few miniature temperature sensors I bought
            the other day. Professor glues them to a metallic cylinder and inserts it in
            &#34;the head.&#34; I see Professor was inspired by my way of handling the lack of
            real stents. I think it is a nail or wire of some sort but I&#39;m not
            sure. Professor handles all the &#34;sensitive equipment&#34; himself. I take pictures
            and write down the results in a notebook. For the next two hours we gather
            temperature readings. I publish a paper with our findings shortly after,
            attach his name to it, update my thesis and everything is good again. I start
            to develop a faint feeling that I sleep better at night when I play along and
            nod approvingly to things I don&#39;t actually agree with instead of being
            pigheaded.
            </p>

            The final day is approaching. Mrs. B., from the Department of Doctoral
            Studies, informs me that I personally have to prepare and bring in food,
            drinks and coffee for the commission when I defend my thesis. I refuse. She
            insists. I point out that the University charges €1000 per student for the
            final show, that each member of the commission is actually getting paid for
            their trouble and that all these expenses plus transport and accommodation are
            already sponsored by our project. She shows signs of slowly winning back her
            memory. Mrs. B. also informs me that I won&#39;t be able to hold back my tears
            upon successfully defending my thesis in front of family, friends and
            colleagues. I successfully defend my thesis a few days later and I refuse her
            that pleasure, too.

            We celebrate at a local restaurant with the whole Department and the
            commission of five professors that evening. I join out from politeness. There
            is not much science to celebrate. After dinner I shake hands with Professor
            and the Head. &#34;He did make a lot of noise around here but he did a great job
            and has very nice results,&#34; the Professor praises me in front of the Head. I
            smile without saying anything. I leave the place and begin to think about the
            years ahead of me. But Professor catches up with me. He is a changed man,
            &#34;Let&#39;s keep working together!&#34; He is brimming with enthusiasm. I refuse him
            politely but he keeps talking as though my previous answer carries no weight
            with him, as he always does. &#34;Yes, let&#39;s keep cooperating on new projects
            together,&#34; he goes on and on. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten into him. Maybe he
            likes his name on new papers too much? He begins to get on my nerves. I answer
            respectfully with simple no&#39;s to all of his questions and proposals. I
            eventually say my goodbyes to him and turn my back. I leave Professor in the
            dark alley and my basement behind for good.
