    <h1>Audioscrape: Building in Rust When Everyone Said I Shouldn&#39;t</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m excited to share my journey of bootstrapping Audioscrape, a podcast exploration platform, built entirely in Rust. Despite conventional wisdom suggesting RoR, Python, or TypeScript for rapid MVP development, I chose Rust to challenge myself technically and optimize for low operational costs. The result? A performant application running on a $7/month VM, demonstrating that you can launch lean and scale efficiently.</p><p>Why Rust for a Bootstrapped MVP?</p><p>Cost-Efficiency: Minimal resource usage translates to lower hosting costs, crucial for bootstrapping.</p><p>Performance: Efficient handling of audio processing and web serving, allowing for growth without immediate infrastructure scaling.</p><p>Learning Investment: Deepening expertise in a language with growing demand, potentially opening future opportunities.</p><p>Proving a Point: Demonstrating Rust&#39;s viability for rapid development in web applications.</p><p>Project Overview:</p><p>Audioscrape aggregates podcast RSS feeds, transcribes episodes, and provides an interactive interface for exploring and discussing podcast content. It&#39;s a full-stack Rust application, leveraging various crates from the ecosystem.</p><p>Technical Stack:</p><p>Backend: Axum (async web framework)</p><p>Database: SQLite with SQLx for type-safe queries</p><p>Authentication: OAuth2</p><p>Image Processing: For social media previews</p><p>HTML Templating: Askama</p><p>Async Runtime: Tokio</p><p>Development Approach:</p><p>4k LoC in a single main.rs file (plus HTML templates)</p><p>Rapid iteration using Neovim for navigation</p><p>Lean development: No external services beyond the VM</p><p>Key Features:</p><p>Transcription Browsing: Read along with your favorite podcasts or quickly scan for topics of interest.</p><p>Segment Highlighting: Share and discuss specific moments from episodes.</p><p>Community Interaction: Upvote, comment on, and bookmark your favorite segments.</p><p>Advanced Search: Find relevant content across multiple podcasts and episodes.</p><p>Person Profiles: Explore appearances of specific guests or hosts across different shows.</p><p>Challenges and Learnings:</p><p>Overcoming the learning curve of Rust&#39;s ownership model</p><p>Efficient transcriptions and speaker detection</p><p>Managing all aspects solo: Development, design, and operations</p><p>Future Plans:</p><p>API for third-party integrations</p><p>WebAssembly for client-side processing</p><p>Scaling strategies for larger datasets (search)</p><p>Personalized content delivery</p><p>Metrics and Goals:</p><p>Current Users: 500 (last 7 days)</p><p>MRR: $0</p><p>Cost per User: Less than $0.01 (thanks to efficient resource use)</p><p>Next Milestone: Add paid features to pay the bills + reduce cost per episode page creation</p><p>Questions for the HN Community:</p><p>Has anyone else bootstrapped using Rust? What were your experiences?</p><p>How do you balance technical debt vs. shipping features in a solo project?</p><p>What strategies have worked for you in marketing such technical products?</p><p>I&#39;m bootstrapping this project and would greatly appreciate any feedback, especially from those who&#39;ve launched similar technical products or used unconventional tech stacks for MVPs.
