    <h1>Bolt has a cool web interface and they really don&#39;t want you to use it</h1>

<p>So far, so good! I always refuse to use services that only work with an app, so this looked promising. One omission from the list of reasons was &#34;Not wanting to contribute to strenghtening Apple and Google duopoly&#34;, but ok.</p><p>I go to the web app, enter my phone number, enter the SMS code and I&#39;m immediately greeted with this beauty:</p><p>2/</p>

<p>I needed some way to get to the Airport in Riga. Everyone recommended Bolt and shared horror stories of &#34;traditional taxis&#34;. </p><p>Fortunately I expected that this web interface business would be too good to be true, so I checked it the night before the flight. </p><p>I checked various different pickup locations around the city. None worked. I tried different countries. Poland: nope.  Norway: nope. But.... it works in Nigeria?</p><p>In fact, I can order a ride without any issues</p><p>3/</p>
</div></div>

<div><div>
<p>Sooo, this got me thinking. Can I trick it into submission and let me order through the web interface? Short answer: yes!</p><p>I messed around with the Network Inspector and tried making various changes in the HTTP requests being made to the API by the web interface. After 10 minutes I found out that if you skip a certain query parameter for one of the crucial endpoints, but keep other ones unchanged, the API ignores this artificial geo-block.</p><p>4/</p>
</div></div>

</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>

<div><div>
<p>(I&#39;m not going to share the particular details on which request and which query parameter that is)</p><p>So, after some changes, this is what I see on the desktop web. I can actually order a ride!</p><p>5/</p>
</div></div>

</div>

<div><div>
<p>I quickly created a CleanLinks config that did this automatically, and now I can order rides without an app, right from my laptop. So basically I made it easier for me to give Bolt money. You&#39;re welcome, Bolt!</p><p>Now, how to make it work on mobile? Fortunately, Firefox Nightly on Android allows you to install any addon, so I added CleanLinks and copied the configuration. And voilÃ ! I can order rides from my phone, without an annoying app!</p><p>6/</p>

<div><div>
<p>In fact, I the bolt came, I arrived at the airport, paid, and made it in time. </p><p>Now. Why create this artificial barrier for your users, Bolt? The usual excuse of &#34;whaaaaa, creating a web app is additional effort and we can&#39;t afford it&#34; doesn&#39;t apply here. You already HAVE a nice, fast, functional web app. why geo-fence it?</p><p>7/</p>
</div></div>

</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>

<div><div>
<p>The answer is: because we, the users, are compliant with such abuse of monopoly. </p><p>This is a reminder to NEVER trust big companies that there&#39;s any good reason to not have a web app unless it&#39;s clearly not technically possible (which is extremely rare anyway imho).</p><p>I invite you to boycott any company that forces (or coerces) you to install an app. We deserve choice, we deserve control. We deserve better. Demand it!</p><p>8/8</p>

<div><p><span><a href="https://toot.kuba-orlik.name/@kuba" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@<span>kuba</span></a></span> personal choice doesn&#39;t work on a real world scale, because 95+% of users aren&#39;t conscious of many things. You know a lot about tech, so you can recognise this artificial barrier, most people won&#39;t. We need laws that require these things, at the very least. Unless we want to overthrow capitalism ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‡</p></div>

<div>

<div><p><span><a href="https://kolektiva.social/@Kavelach">@<span>Kavelach</span></a></span> yes to that! And first step to having laws passed is raising awareness, so this is exactly what I&#39;m doing</p></div>
