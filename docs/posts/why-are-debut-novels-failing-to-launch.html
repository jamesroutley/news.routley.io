    <p>Found via <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/4/michal-zalewski/">Simon Willison’s blog</a>. I liked this quote a lot:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don’t need to be the world’s leading expert to write about a particular topic. Experts are often busy and struggle to explain concepts in an accessible way. You should be honest with yourself and with your readers about what you know and don’t know — but otherwise, it’s OK to write about what excites you, and to do it as you learn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always have this little insecurity in the back of my head of “why write this if a zillion other people have already written about it? Are you really saying something novel and worth people’s attention?” This article gives me a little more oomph to chase that feeling away and write anyways.</p>
