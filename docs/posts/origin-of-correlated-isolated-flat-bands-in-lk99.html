            <span>Abstract:</span>  A recent report of room temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure in
Cu-substituted apatite (`LK99&#39;) has invigorated interest in the understanding
of what materials and mechanisms can allow for high-temperature
superconductivity. Here I perform density functional theory calculations on
Cu-substituted lead phosphate apatite, identifying correlated isolated flat
bands at the Fermi level, a common signature of high transition temperatures in
already established families of superconductors. I elucidate the origins of
these isolated bands as arising from a structural distortion induced by the Cu
ions and a chiral charge density wave from the Pb lone pairs. These results
suggest that a minimal two-band model can encompass much of the low-energy
physics in this system. Finally, I discuss the implications of my results on
possible superconductivity in Cu-doped apatite
