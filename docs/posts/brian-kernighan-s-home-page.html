<b><i>Unix: A History and a Memoir</i></b>.

Since its creation in a Bell Labs attic in 1969, the Unix operating
system has spread far beyond anything its creators could have imagined.
It has led to the development of a great deal of innovative software,
influenced myriad programmers, and changed the path of computer
technology.

<p> This book is part history and part memoir.  It tells the story of
the origin of Unix, explaining what Unix is, how it came about, and why
it matters.  Accessible to non-speciaists, the book is written for
anyone with an interest in computing or the history of inventions.

<b><i>Millions, Billions, Zillions: Defending Yourself
in a World of Too Many Numbers</i></b>.

With examples drawn from a rich variety of sources, including
journalism, advertising, and politics, the book demonstrates how numbers
can mislead and misrepresent.  In chapters covering big numbers, units,
dimensions, and more, it lays bare everything from deceptive graphs to
speciously precise numbers, and shows how anyone -- using a few basic
ideas and lots of shortcuts -- can easily learn to recognize common
mistakes, determine whether numbers are credible, and make their own
sensible estimates when needed.  An essential survival guide for a world
drowning in big -- and often bad -- data.
