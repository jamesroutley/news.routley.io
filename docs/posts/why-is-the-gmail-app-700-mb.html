    <h1>Why is the Gmail app 700 MB?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The Gmail app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/422689480">on the App Store</a>, is
currently 760.7 MB in size. It is in the top three <a href="https://akr.am/app-bloat/">most bloated
apps</a> out of the top 100 free apps. I don’t use it
on my phone, but I was prompted to compare it with the seemingly hefty one I
(have to) use, Outlook, while clearing up some storage space. Its measly 428 MB
size pales in comparison.</p>

<p>This isn’t new. In 2017, Axios
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/the-top-iphone-apps-are-taking-up-a-lot-more-space-1513303131">reported</a>
that the top iPhone apps had been taking up an increasing amount of space over
the period from 2013 to 2017. For most of that period, the size of the Gmail
app hovered around 12 MB, with a sudden jump to more than 200 MB near the start
of 2017. Other popular apps also saw a 10x or more increase in size over the
same period.</p>

<p>Gmail isn’t even the worst offender, it’s just a more popular one. The Tesla
and Crypto.com apps are around 1 GB each. So is Samsung’s SmartThings app.
What about Google’s other popular apps? Google Home is another hefty one, at
630 MB, that I used for its remote feature, which I replaced with Google TV at
almost a tenth the size. Their other popular apps average around <a href="https://akr.am/app-bloat/?list=popular&amp;developer=Google">250
MB</a> in size. This
seems tame in comparison to Microsoft, with an average app size of around
<a href="https://akr.am/app-bloat/?list=popular&amp;developer=Microsoft+Corporation">330MB</a>.
For reference, the average size of an app in the top 100 free apps is <a href="https://akr.am/app-bloat/?list=top">280
MB</a> or, in a more expanded set (including
games), <a href="https://akr.am/app-bloat/?list=popular">200MB</a>.</p>

<p>Just to put this into perspective, on my device, apps (excluding their data)
use up 35 GB, and the data is another 35 GB. iOS takes up another 25 GB. Let’s
say, 100 GB for apps, data and the OS. That leaves me with 20 GB (leaving a
margin of free space for updates) meant to be used for capturing 4K video and
high-quality photos (why else get an iPhone), and storing music (don’t even
think about lossless). The reality is that running out of space also slows
things down, since most of my photos need to be fetched from the cloud before
viewing them, and I need to re-download these hefty offloaded apps when I need
them again. And good luck if you have a limited data bundle.</p>

<p>Maybe this doesn’t matter. The latest iPhones start at 256 GB, and surely I’ll
have plenty of space when I get a new one (although I remember saying this when
I upgraded to 64 GB from 32 GB). It’s not really about the space though. These
apps don’t have 50x or even 10x the functionality. But now they’re 100x larger,
and probably slower. Why?</p>

<p>Also, can someone explain why Microsoft Authenticator is 150 MB to show 6-digit
codes?</p>

<p>It’s not clear if this is specifically an iOS problem. I don’t have an Android
device and I could not find a way to get that information from the Play Store
without a device. That said, I checked the size of Gmail on someone’s Android
phone, and it’s around 185 MB, which certainly seems much better.</p>

<p>And if you’re considering switching from the default apps, this is what the
installed size (which differs slightly from the App Store size) is of the
alternatives on my iPhone running iOS 26.2:</p>

<p>So, why is the Gmail app almost 80x the size of the native Mail app? My guess
is as good as yours.</p>
