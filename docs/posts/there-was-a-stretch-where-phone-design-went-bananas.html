      <p>Do you administer a Mastodon instance? Is it falling over all the time now because it&#39;s running out of disk space because everyone is joining the network? Here is a quick PSA: <code>tootctl media remove</code> <strong>does not remove all the remote media</strong>. It removes all remote media more than 7 days old. It used to be that, on the server that I run, <a href="https://recurse.social">recurse.social</a>, that would leave a handful of GB of media. Now it&#39;s more like 25GB of media. If you don&#39;t want to have to resize your server to deal with the peak of the influx of new users, consider changing your cronjob to something like <code>tootctl media remove --days=1</code>, to more aggressively delete remote media that&#39;s unlikely to be needed.</p>
