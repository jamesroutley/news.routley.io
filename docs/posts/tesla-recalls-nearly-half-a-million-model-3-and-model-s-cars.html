    <h1>Tesla recalls nearly half a million Model 3 and Model S cars</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="O7CdKE">Tesla has issued voluntary recalls for nearly half a million vehicles to address potential failures in its trunk latching systems, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-recall-models-trunk-crash-issues-51640868026?tesla=y">as first reported by <em>Barron’s</em></a>. The recalls apply to <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2019/TESLA/MODEL%2525203/4%252520DR/RWD#recalls">all Model 3 units</a> released between 2017 and 2020, as well as <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2015/TESLA/MODEL%252520S%25252070D/5%252520HB/AWD#recalls">certain Model S units</a>. </p>
<p id="TUoHyZ">For the Model 3, Tesla believes the opening and closing of the trunk could damage the cable harness attaching the rearview camera, causing the camera to unexpectedly fail. The Model S issue is more serious, potentially preventing the front trunk from fully latching.</p>
<p id="ibkiQh">According to documents submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there are 475,318 vehicles subject to the recall, comprising 356,309 Model 3 vehicles and 119,109 Model S vehicles. Tesla estimates that only 1 percent of the Model 3 vehicles will actually display the defect, compared to 14 percent of the recalled Model S vehicles.</p>
<p id="kFOGCq">The Model S recall is particularly concerning because the issue affects the front trunk, which could obstruct the driver’s view of the road if it flies open while driving. In the affected Model S cars, “the front trunk latch assembly may be misaligned, preventing the secondary hood latch from engaging,” Tesla told NHTSA in an official filing.</p>
<p id="mCXZEs">Since the Model S problem is a misalignment rather than a damaged component, Tesla believes that repositioning the latch device at a service center will resolve the issue. For affected Model 3 owners, Tesla has pledged to install a new cable harness and guide protector free of charge.</p>
