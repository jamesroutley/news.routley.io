    <h1>Ask HN: Why does HN require tiny baby fingers to operate on a phone?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A full 3rd or more of the time when i try to tap on the &#34;new&#34; link at the top of HN, i accidentally tap the &#34;jobs&#34; link with my average-sized fingers because my phone wraps HN such that &#34;jobs&#34; is directly below &#34;new&#34;, with like 3 pixels of gap between them.</p><p>Similarly, the links across each post in the list, along with the near-microscopic &#34;up&#34; arrow, require teeny tiny baby fingers to tap reliably.</p><p>Certainly no tiny babies are using HN, so... please, HN, fontSize+=2 for the links! :-D</p></div></div></div>
