    <h1>Tell HN: Cloudflare is blocking Pale Moon and other non-mainstream browsers</h1>

Their &#34;Submit feedback&#34; tool yields no results. A Cloudflare Community topic was flagged as &#34;spam&#34; by members of that community and was promptly locked with no real solution, and no official response from Cloudflare:</p><p><a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/access-denied-to-pale-moon-desktop-browser/764330" rel="nofollow">https://community.cloudflare.com/t/access-denied-to-pale-moo...</a></p><p>Partial list of other browsers that are being denied access:</p><p>Falkon, SeaMonkey, IceCat, Basilisk.</p><p>Hacker News 2022 post about the same issue, which brought attention and had Cloudflare quickly patching the issue:</p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31317886">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31317886</a></p><p>A Cloudflare product manager declared back then: &#34;...we do not want to be in the business of saying one browser is more legitimate than another.&#34;</p><p>As of now, there is no official response from Cloudflare. Internet access is still denied by their tool.</p></div></div></div>
