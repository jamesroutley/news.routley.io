</span><strong>Hotel Tonight x OpenTable x ClassPass</strong><span>. The idea was to bring live connectivity to an industry where 80% of bookings were still done using pen and paper, months ahead of time. </span></p><p><span>We </span><strong>worked on it for 3 years</strong><span> while holding down full-time jobs, burning the midnight oil on nights and weekends. The initial money came from </span><strong>wedding gifts</strong><span>, the rest from our </span><strong>house fund and paychecks</strong><span>. We moved out of a fancy high-rise and into my parents basement to plow our &#34;rent&#34; money into the third-party development.</span></p><p><span>During the tail end of COVID, </span><strong>we packed up the truck</strong><span> and </span><strong>moved our lives</strong><span> from the East Coast to Florida, where we could market to year round tourism. We decided to “go West, young man” (well, South) and chase our dreams.</span></p><blockquote><h3>Lesson #1: Differentiate technical risk from execution risk. </h3></blockquote><p>There&#39;s a reason everyone has a clever idea for a marketplace - they don&#39;t require you to actually build a standalone, unique product. And the technical barriers to entry are lower than high tech (like cybersecurity).</p><p><span>It </span><strong>appears simple to play middle man</strong><span>, connecting supply / demand in a novel way. However, it&#39;s a long road to aggregate both sides and drive network effects. There are massive execution risks. You have to solve for two sides, not just one.</span></p><blockquote><h3>Lesson #2: Don&#39;t be 100% dependent on someone else&#39;s data. </h3></blockquote><p><span>Partnering with store management systems made it easier to hack the supply side, but dictated our development efforts and unit economics. </span><strong>We had massive platform risk</strong><span>. If any of our partners cut us off, we were screwed. Data couldn’t be our competitive moat, because we didn’t own it.</span></p><blockquote><h3>Lesson #3: You don&#39;t need to build everything at once. </h3></blockquote><p><span>Building a website, Android app, and iOS app </span><strong>before proving product market fit</strong><span> was like </span><strong>burning money</strong><span>. It took us over a year to get to market, sell something, and get real feedback.</span></p><p><span>You should </span><strong>start small and get one platform right</strong><span>. Especially if you are </span><strong>paying someone else to do the coding</strong><span>. Some international developers are great value and true biz partners, while others are chop shops who will pump and dump. Speaking of that...</span></p><blockquote><h3>Lesson #4: Don&#39;t make everything reliant on code if you can&#39;t code.</h3></blockquote><p><span>There were 1,000 times I felt </span><strong>absolutely helpless</strong><span>, knowing what needed to be done, but not being able to jump in and fix it myself.</span></p><p><span>I&#39;ll never depend on a 3rd party dev as the main means of production again. We would have been better off finding a technical co-founder rather than </span><strong>outsourcing flexibility and control</strong><span>. </span></p><blockquote><h3>Lesson #5: No one is going to invest in your business if you aren&#39;t willing to quit your day job. </h3></blockquote><p><span>If you aren&#39;t crazy enough to take the plunge, </span><strong>why should they be</strong><span>? Full stop.</span></p><blockquote><h3>Lesson #6: Adding more features is an expensive distraction. </h3></blockquote><p><span>If it isn&#39;t improving your </span><strong>&#34;core job to be done&#34;</strong><span> then don&#39;t spend time on it. Especially if you&#39;ve yet to prove product market fit. Features are shiny objects that give you a false sense of accomplishment, and really pull you off track. </span><strong>Stay the course!</strong></p><blockquote><h3>Lesson #7: As a marketplace, you can be either low frequency or low price, but you can&#39;t be both. </h3></blockquote><p><span>Our average purchase was $60 per ticket x 3 tickets, or $180. However, </span><strong>people go on vacation infrequently.</strong><span> And they&#39;d have to remember us again each time. We were in the proverbial </span><strong>dead zone</strong><span>. We had what they call </span><strong>low Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition Cost</strong><span>.</span></p><blockquote><h3>Lesson #8: Constraints drive focus. </h3></blockquote><p><span>We tried to launch tours in +20 states at once, but quickly found we </span><strong>didn&#39;t have the time or budget</strong><span> to market everywhere. In addition, each market was different on the ground.</span></p><p>We honed in multiple times. </p><p><code>USA --&gt; Southern USA --&gt; Florida --&gt; South West Florida --&gt; Tampa, Florida</code></p><p><span>Nail it at the (</span><strong>hyper) local level</strong><span> and </span><strong>build a playbook</strong><span>. If you are everywhere at once, you are </span><strong>really nowhere</strong><span>.</span></p><blockquote><h3>Lesson #9: A founder&#39;s #1 job is sales. </h3></blockquote><p><strong>I hated cold calling</strong><span>. I hated walking into a scuba shop and nervously asking for the owner. I hated getting rejected. But I couldn&#39;t hide behind a screen and work on strategy. </span><strong>I had to sell.</strong></p><p><strong>A product without distribution is nothing.</strong></p><blockquote><h3>Lesson #10: Killing your baby is really hard. </h3></blockquote><p><span>It took us longer than it should have to call it quits. We put off the decision for months. Even now, it </span><strong>physically pains me</strong><span> to use the word &#34;</span><strong>quit</strong><span>&#34;. I haven&#39;t written or said it until this point.</span></p><blockquote><h3>Conclusion:</h3></blockquote><p><strong>Does losing $200K hurt?</strong><span> </span></p><p><strong>Yes. </strong><span>Absolutely</span><strong>.</strong><span> </span></p><p>But I also look at it as my &#34;real world MBA&#34;. </p><p>So what did I get out of it?</p><p><span>It led me to </span><strong>start this newsletter</strong><span>, since I was learning so many business concepts and didn’t want to forget them. And I never would have developed </span><strong>the</strong><span> </span><strong>guts to put myself</strong><span> out there if I hadn&#39;t been shot down by hundreds of tour operators, tourists, hotels (and even family members).</span></p><p><span>I also learned the level of commitment it takes to bring something from 0 to 1. It&#39;s </span><strong>really, really hard to build something from scratch</strong><span>. And it takes </span><strong>an insane amount of irrational confidence.</strong></p><p><span>And finally, I ended up </span><strong>landing my first CFO role</strong><span> at a </span><strong>venture-backed tech marketplace</strong><span>. Talk about unexpected outcomes... I finally found somewhere to apply my marketplace knowledge. </span><strong>And</strong><span> </span><strong>if I didn&#39;t have this previous entrepreneurial experience, or this newsletter, it wouldn&#39;t have been possible.</strong></p><p><strong>There are seasons to life, and if you don’t close one door, you can’t open another.</strong></p><p><span>So that&#39;s the story of how I lost $200K, but came out on the other side smarter and happier. </span><strong>And if something doesn&#39;t scare you, it&#39;s probably not worth doing at all.</strong></p><p><a href="http://bit.ly/404PPNT" rel="">Wonder Tools</a><span> is a free weekly email that helps you discover the most useful sites and apps and see out how to make the most of them.
