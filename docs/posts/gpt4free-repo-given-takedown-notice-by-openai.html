He tinkered and toyed with devtools galore,
And found himself curious, eager for more.

He copy-pasted requests, with glee and delight,
A personal project, to last him the night.
For educational purposes, and fun it was too,
This little boy&#39;s journey had just begun anew.

Now far away, in a tower so grand,
A big company stood, ruling the land.
Their software was mighty, their power supreme,
But they never expected this boy and his dream.

As he played with their code, they started to fret,
&#34;What if he breaks it? What if we&#39;re upset?&#34;
They panicked and worried, their faces turned red,
As visions of chaos danced in their head.

The CEO paced in his office so wide,
His minions all scurrying to hide.
&#34;Who is this child?&#34; he cried out in fear,
&#34;Who dares to disrupt our digital sphere?&#34;

The developers gathered, their keyboards ablaze,
To analyze the boy&#39;s mischievous ways.
They studied his project, they pored through his code,
And soon they discovered his humble abode.

&#34;We must stop him!&#34; they cried with a shiver,
&#34;This little boy&#39;s making our company quiver!&#34;
So they plotted and schemed to halt his advance,
To put an end to his digital dance.
