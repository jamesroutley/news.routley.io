    <h1>Trying out Zed after more than a decade of Vim/Neovim</h1>

<article>
    <p>I&#39;m currently drafting this blog post in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://zed.dev">Zed</a>. After using Vim/Neovim for more than 15
years, I recently decided to try out something new. I don&#39;t know if this little
experiment will work, or if I&#39;ll run back to my trusty Neovim, but hey, what I do know
is that I&#39;d like to find out.</p>
<h2 id="why-try-something-else">Why try something else?</h2>
<p>Why though? If you&#39;ve used a specific tool for that long, why (try to) switch to
something else anyway? Everyone has their own reasons. I have two.</p>
<h3 id="1-the-desire-to-use-something-that-just-works">1. The desire to use something that just works</h3>
<p>Lately, I&#39;ve been drifting towards things that &#34;just work&#34;.</p>
<p>I love (Neo)Vim. Like I wrote earlier, it&#39;s been my primary editor for the past 15
years. What I don&#39;t love is all the configuration that goes into it before I can use it
to start writing code.</p>
<p>When I first started using Vim (in 2009!), my configuration was a tiny <code>.vimrc</code> file
that was handed over to me by my internship supervisor at that time. I had no idea what
it did, but it worked. Over time, as I felt the need to customize things, my <code>.vimrc</code>
started accumulating increasingly more code copied from StackOverflow that I didn&#39;t
understand.</p>
<p>At some point Neovim came out, and with it, the ability to configure things using Lua.
This was a huge step up, because I could at least understand what I was configuring.</p>
<p>Either way, it&#39;s still configuration. What changed was just <em>how</em> that configuration was
done. The combination of configuring the base editor and installing a set of plugins
(and making sure that they play nice with each other) isn&#39;t really something that I
would like to spend my time on, going forward.</p>
<p>One recent example that highlights this problem: my work setup consists of switching
back and forth between a terminal window and an editor window. At any time, I have
multiple projects open in both. On macOS, it&#39;s been difficult to find a solution that
&#34;just works&#34;. The most popular Neovim GUI clients on macOS include <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/qvacua/vimr">Vimr</a> and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://neovide.dev/">Neovide</a>,
which are both excellent projects. Neovide though, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/neovide/neovide/issues/1332">does not support multiple windows</a>,
which is integral to my workflow and hence requires me to implement <a href="https://sgoel.dev/posts/switching-between-projects-in-neovim/">workarounds</a>, which
actually broke last week after I ran <code>:PackerUpdate</code>. And while Vimr does support
multiple windows, it is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/issues/887">not able to render icons in nvim-tree</a>, which is less than
ideal. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<h3 id="2-deeper-and-native-llm-integration">2. Deeper and native LLM integration</h3>
<p>LLMs are happening, whether we like it or not. And no, the fact that they aren&#39;t 100%
correct all the time is not a reason to discard them entirely. I understand why some
people don&#39;t want to use them. And I respect that. I personally find them useful and
would like to integrate them more into my daily workflow.</p>
<p>The Neovim ecosystem has a bunch of plugins for using LLMs. But as I wrote in the
previous section, I&#39;d like to avoid plugins when possible. Installing plugins means
updating them, which inevitably breaks things.</p>
<p>One example where I find LLMs useful when coding is handling boilerplate stuff. In my
current Neovim setup, I have the the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.nvim">Codeium extension</a> installed, which offers code
suggestions that are like an autocomplete on steroids. Often, I can write a function
name and what parameters it&#39;s expecting, and the LLM writes out the function for me.
This is particularly helpful when writing small functions or test cases.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to be able to do more of such things in my editor. I&#39;m not entirely sold on the
idea of agentic editors, as I&#39;d like to keep at least <em>some</em> agency over the code that&#39;s
going in, but that&#39;s a different topic.</p>
<p>Another example of where I find LLMs useful: I&#39;m not a native English speaker and often
struggle to find the right sentence framing that is both concise and catchy. LLMs are
excellent at this! I can scribble my initial thoughts, throw it at an LLM and ask it to
reframe the whole thing, which is great!</p>
<p>Generally, it feels like the way we&#39;re writing code is changing with the introduction of
this extremely powerful tool, and I&#39;d like to not be left behind.</p>
<h2 id="why-zed">Why Zed?</h2>
<p>So yeah, those are the two reasons why I&#39;ve been looking to try out something else
lately. What made me go for Zed?</p>
<h3 id="1-vim-mode">1. Vim mode</h3>
<p>Yep, that&#39;s literally the first reason. After using Vim for 15 years, my fingers have
built up enough muscle memory that not using Vim keybindings when writing code is
downright impossible.</p>
<p>Zed&#39;s <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://zed.dev/docs/vim">Vim mode</a> is surprisingly solid! So far, I feel right at home. Almost all Vim
keybindings that I&#39;m used to work just as expected. The one or two bindings that don&#39;t
work, are something that I can make my peace with and retrain my fingers on. Everything
else works excellent. It also looks like they&#39;re <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://zed.dev/blog/vim-2025">doubling down on their Vim mode</a>
support in 2025, which is a great sign!</p>
<h3 id="2-it-just-works">2. It just works</h3>
<p>When you fire up Zed, the editor is fully functional without having to write a single
line of configuration. That&#39;s awesome. The editor may prompt you every now and then to
install support for specific languages. But that&#39;s usually just one button click.</p>
<h3 id="3-json-configuration">3. JSON Configuration</h3>
<p>Lua is great, but one JSON file is even better. Zed uses JSON as the configuration
syntax and so far it feels a lot simpler than what I&#39;ve worked with so far.</p>
<h3 id="4-configuration-autocomplete">4. Configuration autocomplete</h3>
<p>I had no idea I needed this until I had it!</p>
<p><img src="https://sgoel.dev/posts/trying-out-zed-after-more-than-a-decade-of-vim-neovim/zed-configuration-autocomplete.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>While editing the Zed configuration file, I found it really helpful how the editor
suggests configuration keys and their potential values. This feature felt really
thoughtful when I first saw it and I could imagine that it goes a long way in getting
new users up to speed quicker.</p>
<h3 id="5-native-llm-integration">5. Native LLM integration</h3>
<p>I know some people have been turned off by this, but I actually like this feature.</p>
<p>Zed has a feature called Assistant, which is a tool to, well, assist you, using a large
language model of your choice. A few popular LLM providers are supported. Once set up,
you can open up with the Assistant panel to work together with the language model. For
instance, it&#39;s pretty easy to type in questions in the panel window and then paste text
from your open file buffers into it to give the LLM more context. There&#39;s a lot more to
this feature that I haven&#39;t used yet, but I&#39;ll probably get to it the more I use it.</p>
<p>Overall, the integration feels very native and very useful.</p>
<h3 id="6-fast">6. Fast!</h3>
<p>Last but definitely not the least is speed! Zed is <em>very</em> fast. Everything feels very
snappy, and it&#39;s clear that the team has put a lot of effort into making everything
fast.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It&#39;s only been a day since I really started using Zed instead of Neovim as my daily
driver. And so far the experience has been quite nice.</p>
<p>Like I wrote earlier, this is an experiment. We&#39;ll see how things turn out. That being
said though, the first impression looks <strong>very</strong> good.</p>
