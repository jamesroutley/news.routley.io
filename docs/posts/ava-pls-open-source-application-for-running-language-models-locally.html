        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <div>
            <h5>What is a language server?</h5>
            <p>
              A language server is a specialized program that processes language-related tasks. This includes activities like
              text generation, grammar correction, rephrasing, summarization, data extraction, and more.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>What is a language model?</h5>
            <p>
              A language model is a type of artificial intelligence that understands and generates human language. It&#39;s the
              engine behind many modern language processing tools.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>How is privacy ensured?</h5>
            <p>
              Ava processes all language tasks locally on your device. This means your data never leaves your computer and is
              not shared with any external servers, ensuring maximum privacy.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Do I need an internet connection?</h5>
            <p>
              Once Ava is downloaded and set up, you don&#39;t need an active internet connection. However, to download a
              language model, you&#39;ll need to be connected to the internet.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>How much does it cost?</h5>
            <p>
              Good news! The basic version is completely free. There will be a premium version in the future, but the core
              functionalities will always remain accessible without any cost.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>How do I get started?</h5>
            <p>It&#39;s simple! Download Ava, install it on your desktop, and you&#39;re all set to explore its capabilities.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>What languages are supported?</h5>
            <p>
              It depends on the language model you choose. Theoretically, any language can be supported. However, majority of
              models are trained on English. This will likely improve in the future but it&#39;s not something we can control.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Which operating systems are supported?</h5>
            <p>Currently, only macOS version is available. Windows is coming soon and Linux is planned for the future.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Is there a version for mobile devices?</h5>
            <p>Not at the moment. However, we&#39;re exploring the possibility of a mobile version. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
