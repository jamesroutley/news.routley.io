    <h1>First automatic JPEG-XL cloud service</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><blockquote><em><a href="https://www.gumlet.com">Gumlet</a> is bringing JPEG-XL to our customers before any other cloud service. Here is story on how we did it and why.</em></blockquote><p>We all know JPEG is king of all image formats. Even after the advent of WebP and AVIF, JPEG continues to account for over 30% of the total images delivered by Gumlet, even with the magic of automatic image conversion that we do.</p><p>For the average person, using JPEG is the safest and best option. It is compatible with all operating systems, browsers, and apps. It also has a reasonably small file size compared to PNG - another widely used image format.</p><p>JPEG&#39;s conspicuous issues like lack of transparency, animation, lossless compression and high bit depth support make it a little tough to justify it as the leading format for time to come. Various attempts like WebP and AVIF are made (and are supported on modern browsers) to overcome the problems of JPEG, but they all also suffer some shortcomings of their own. Rather than discussing it, let&#39;s see how the web will finally change with this new format - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_XL">JPEG-XL</a>.</p><h2 id="built-for-future">Built for Future</h2><p>JPEG-XL is what we believe is the next 20-year format. Why?</p><p>It&#39;s not one but multiple reasons.</p><ul><li>60-70% smaller size compared to similar quality JPEG üòÆ</li><li>Dimension of up to a billion pixels allowed (JPEG-XL exclusive)</li><li>4099 channels support (JPEG-XL exclusive)</li><li>Animation support</li><li>Tile support for large images</li><li>Progressive decoding (see low-resolution image first before full image loads - JPEG-XL and JPEG exclusive)</li><li>Lossless encoding support</li><li>Wide-color gamut support</li><li>Extremely fast for both encoding and decoding (WebP and AVIF are much slower)</li><li>Royalty-free ü§ò</li></ul><p>This basically means anything a photographer, developer or animation creator can think of, this format supports it. Everyone stays happy and gets to use one format for everything.</p><p>YAY!</p><p>Not quite there yet! As always, we have a twist. This format is currently supported by no operating system, browser or mobile apps ‚òπÔ∏è</p><p>The good news is that it will all change with the new Apple operating system.</p><h2 id="apple-to-the-rescue-%F0%9F%8D%8E">Apple to the Rescue üçé</h2><p>The format was in trial by Chrome and Firefox, but to much of everyone&#39;s disappointment, it was dropped by both in December 2022. However, to everyone&#39;s surprise, Apple added support for JPEG-XL in iOS 17, macOS Sonoma and most importantly, Safari browser.</p><p>That&#39;s huge! This means that all apps on these platforms will also have JPEG-XL support, and all websites can use JPEG-XL when a user is using Safari.</p><p>This improves workflows for artists and photographers and makes the developer&#39;s life easy by ensuring the best image quality is displayed while having the smallest size.</p><h2 id="gumlet-rollout">Gumlet Rollout</h2><p>We were super excited by Apple&#39;s announcement, and we worked hard over the last few months to add support for JPEG-XL in Gumlet image optimization product. This means any iOS 17 or macOS Sonoma user with Safari browser will automatically get a JPEG-XL image. </p><p>Our customers don&#39;t need to do a single thing! It&#39;s available to all for free, without even flipping a switch. We have already flipped it :)</p><p>If you want to try it, pass <code>format=jxl</code> in query parameters.</p><h2 id="test-image">Test Image</h2><p>There will be more browsers who will follow suit in the coming years. If you want to test browser support, here is a test image:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><picture>
