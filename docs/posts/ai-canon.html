<p><span>Research in artificial intelligence is increasing at an exponential rate. It’s difficult for AI experts to keep up with everything new being published, and even harder for beginners to know where to start.</span></p>
<p><span>So, in this post, we’re sharing a curated list of resources we’ve relied on to get smarter about modern AI. We call it the “AI Canon” because these papers, blog posts, courses, and guides have had an outsized impact on the field over the past several years.</span></p>
<p><span>We start with a gentle introduction to </span><i><span>transformer </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>latent diffusion</span></i><span> models, which are fueling the current AI wave. Next, we go deep on technical learning resources; practical guides to building with large language models (LLMs); and analysis of the AI market. Finally, we include a reference list of landmark research results, starting with “Attention is All You Need” — the 2017 paper by Google that introduced the world to transformer models and ushered in the age of generative AI.</span></p>

<p><span>These articles require no specialized background and can help you get up to speed quickly on the most important parts of the modern AI wave.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong><a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Software 2.0</a></strong></span><span>: Andrej Karpathy was one of the first to clearly explain (in 2017!) why the new AI wave really matters. His argument is that AI is a new and powerful way to program computers. As LLMs have improved rapidly, this thesis has proven prescient, and it gives a good mental model for how the AI market may progress. </span></li>
<li><span><strong><span><a href="https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/db3f4859-cd30-4445-a0cd-553c3304f8e2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of GPT</a></span></strong>: Also from Karpathy, this is a very approachable explanation of how ChatGPT / GPT models in general work, how to use them, and what directions R&amp;D may take.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span><strong><span>What is ChatGPT doing … and why does it work?</span></strong></span></span></a><span>: Computer scientist and entrepreneur Stephen Wolfram gives a long but highly readable explanation, from first principles, of how modern AI models work. He follows the timeline from early neural nets to today’s LLMs and ChatGPT.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><a href="https://daleonai.com/transformers-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transformers, explained</a></strong></span><span>: This post by Dale Markowitz is a shorter, more direct answer to the question “what is an LLM, and how does it work?” This is a great way to ease into the topic and develop intuition for the technology. It was written about GPT-3 but still applies to newer models.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><a href="https://mccormickml.com/2022/12/21/how-stable-diffusion-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Stable Diffusion works</a></strong></span><span>: This is the computer vision analogue to the last post. Chris McCormick gives a layperson’s explanation of how Stable Diffusion works and develops intuition around text-to-image models generally. For an even </span><i><span>gentler </span></i><span>introduction, check out this </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/zs5dk5/i_made_an_infographic_to_explain_how_stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>comic</span></a><span> from r/StableDiffusion.</span></li>

<li><strong><span><a href="https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The scaling hypothesis</a></span></strong><span>: One of the most surprising aspects of LLMs is that scaling — adding more data and compute — just keeps increasing accuracy.

<p><span>Most of the amazing AI products we see today are the result of no-less-amazing research, carried out by experts inside large companies and leading universities. Lately, we’ve also seen impressive work from individuals and the open source community taking popular projects into new directions, for example by creating automated agents or porting models onto smaller hardware footprints. </span></p>
<p><span>Here’s a collection of many of these papers and projects, for folks who really want to dive deep into generative AI. (For research papers and projects, we’ve also included links to the accompanying blog posts or websites, where available, which tend to explain things at a higher level.
