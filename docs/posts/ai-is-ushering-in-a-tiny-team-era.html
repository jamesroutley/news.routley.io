    <h1>AI is ushering in a &#39;tiny team&#39; era</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>I’m a note-taker and a list-maker. I have lists of books I want to read and movies I want to watch, but most of my lists are for collecting ideas. They include ideas for blog posts, websites, businesses, open-source code, video games, books, and other kinds of projects.</p>

<p>Some of these ideas, the really good ones, have been gestating for years. I find myself returning to them often to add details as I think of them, continually fleshing them out, and refining them. Some have pages of notes by this point. I tell myself that when the time is right for a new post, project, business or book, I can pick up the idea and run with it.</p>

<p>Sometimes it works pretty well. Both <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2020/09/08/gridmaster-closing-thoughts">Gridmaster</a> and <a href="https://musicbox.fun">Music Box Fun</a> were long-gestating project ideas that I built and launched when the time was right.</p>

<p>But I’ve also learned that waiting for the right time is risky.</p>

<p>For one, sometimes <strong>the world changes</strong>, and your idea no longer makes sense.</p>

<p>I once drafted a blog post about some quirky behaviors in <code>npm</code>, but by the time I came back to refine it, the behaviors had been fixed. Another time, I had an idea for a podcast, only <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2014/02/14/tldr/">to watch somebody else create it</a> (they did a <em>great</em> job). Most recently, I’ve found that several of my project ideas can be replaced by a simple AI prompt (like, <em>“Generate some lorem ipsum text in the style of Dr. Seuss”</em>).</p>

<p>But the other reason that waiting is risky, is that <strong>you</strong> change.</p>

<p>I’ve got several ideas for children’s books, but I can feel my interest in them waning as my kids get older. Several of the business ideas I added grew out of pain points that I no longer have. And when I look at some of the more ambitious projects, I wonder if I even still have the appetite to take a swing at them.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s good that I didn’t waste my time building some niche thing only to have it replaced by AI. Maybe I dodged a bullet by not committing to a business I would have grown out of.</p>

<p>But when I look at my freshest, most exciting ideas—it pains me to know that if I don’t build them now, I might never do it, because I’ll never feel as passionate about them as I do today.</p>
