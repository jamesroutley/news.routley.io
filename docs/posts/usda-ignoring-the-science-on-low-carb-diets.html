If no question is asked, no review gets done, and this would mean that the guidelines would have no chance of including a low-carbohydrate option until the 2030 guidelines or later.</span></p><p><span>The public, given a month to comment, was clearly upset. </span><a href="https://www.nutritioncoalition.us/news/2022/5/23/77-of-comments-to-usda-call-for-review-of-low-carb-science" rel="">Nearly 80% </a><span>of the total comments, or some 1,200 individuals, urged the USDA-HHS to consider the extensive scientific literature on low-carb. The public comment period closed in mid-May, and the agencies have not yet responded.</span></p><p><span>Many commenters </span><a href="https://www.nutritioncoalition.us/news/2022/5/23/77-of-comments-to-usda-call-for-review-of-low-carb-science" rel="">expressed frustration</a><span> that they had suffered from obesity and other diet-related conditions for years without being told about the availability of a low-carbohydrate approach—which subsequently resolved their health problems. As one commenter </span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/HHS-OASH-2022-0005-0611" rel="">wrote</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>“I am a retired physician who personally struggled with overweight or obesity since childhood. I counseled patients on the same issues, using nutritional &amp; exercise guidelines from government and medical experts. Those guidelines did not work for my patients or me. I would lose weight on calorie counting &amp; exercise but could not sustain this when eating carbohydrates, including so-called healthy whole grains. Only when I discovered information about low carb/ketogenic way of eating at age 69 did my struggles end. I have been following low carb eating since then, feel wonderful, have excellent exercise endurance, saw my HDL increase to 104, and suffer no more joint pains.”</p></blockquote><h3><strong>It All Goes Back to the Guidelines…</strong></h3><p>The inability to get low-carb information from most doctors, dietitians or other clinicians can be traced directly to the guidelines, which are considered the ‘gold standard’ by healthcare practitioners and are taught at every level of schooling. By law, the guidelines also determine the food served in all federal nutrition programs, such as school lunches, feeding programs for the elderly, and more.</p><p>Grains, bread, and other starches have been the foundation of the U.S. ‘food pyramid’ since the guidelines began in 1980. Ten servings of bread per day was the original recommendation. Today, the guidelines recommend six servings of grains daily (including 3 refined), plus up to 10% of calories as sugar. Altogether, the 2020 guidelines recommend eating 52%-56% of calories as carbohydrates, up a couple of percentage points from the last guidelines, in 2015.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96676856-1691-4c87-9676-db1eb3b323da_1950x2040.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96676856-1691-4c87-9676-db1eb3b323da_1950x2040.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96676856-1691-4c87-9676-db1eb3b323da_1950x2040.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96676856-1691-4c87-9676-db1eb3b323da_1950x2040.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96676856-1691-4c87-9676-db1eb3b323da_1950x2040.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96676856-1691-4c87-9676-db1eb3b323da_1950x2040.jpeg" width="554" height="579.4931318681319" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/96676856-1691-4c87-9676-db1eb3b323da_1950x2040.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1523,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:554,&#34;bytes&#34;:259574,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96676856-1691-4c87-9676-db1eb3b323da_1950x2040.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96676856-1691-4c87-9676-db1eb3b323da_1950x2040.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96676856-1691-4c87-9676-db1eb3b323da_1950x2040.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96676856-1691-4c87-9676-db1eb3b323da_1950x2040.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></a></figure></div><p>Contrast that with the &lt;25-30% of calories as carbs on a low-carb diet—clearly a very different idea. This amount of carbohydrates may seem quite low to the average person, but remember that for the most part, people turn to this way of eating because they’ve been diagnosed with a serious health problem, such as diabetes, which usually means that they can no longer tolerate high levels of sugars or starches.</p><p>A low-carbohydrate approach clearly differs sharply from the government’s guidelines—and is likely one reason why the UDSA-HHS have been unresponsive to the relevant science.</p><h3><strong>Congress is Concerned</strong></h3><p><span>Congress first aired its awareness of lapses by the USDA-HHS regarding the science on low-carbohydrate diets at </span><a href="https://republicans-agriculture.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=2731" rel="">a rare hearing</a><span> on the guidelines, in October, 2015. Quite a few members of Congress </span><a href="https://www.nutritioncoalition.us/congressional-hearing-on-october-7th-selected-excerpts" rel="">expressed concern</a><span> that the guidelines were too high in carbohydrates for many people.</span></p><p>Former Congressman Dan Benishek, a physician from Michigan, commented,</p><blockquote><p>“Fifty-two percent of Americans are pre-diabetic or diabetic, and yet, the dietary recommendations that, as I understand it, are not really appropriate for that….These people have a carbohydrate intolerance and — and there [are] more carbohydrates in the diet that you’re recommending than is really appropriate for that.”</p></blockquote><p>Vicki Hartzler from Missouri said, </p><blockquote><p>“I have heard concerns that the [USDA] has ignored a large, credible and growing body of peer-reviewed science on low-carb diets, as it contradicts the evidence from previous guidelines.”</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The National Academies’ Report on the Dietary Guidelines</strong></h3><p><span>Out of this awareness came a Congressional mandate—and a $1 million appropriation—for the first-ever peer-review of the guidelines, by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM).</span><a id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" rel="">4</a><span>  The resulting report, in 2017, was published in two parts, with a number of recommendations for the USDA to adopt. Just recently, the NASEM issued </span><a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26406/evaluating-the-process-to-develop-the-dietary-guidelines-for-americans-2020-2025" rel="">another report</a><span>, to evaluate how the USDA had done in complying with its 2017 recommendations thus far.</span></p><p>The 2022 evaluation is not rosy. The guidelines process still has a ways to go to to “be trusted by the scientific community, health professionals, and the public,” it says.</p><p>Not one of the seven recommendations made by the NASEM in 2017 has been fully adopted (or, in one case, evidence is lacking to make an assessment), says the report.</p><p>Worse, the guidelines process continues to raise “serious concerns about transparency and conflict of interest.” Among other things, it does not undergo outside peer-review (as recommended by the 2017 NASEM report) and its study-selection process is lacking to the point that it “compromise[s] the integrity, transparency, deliberative process, and leave[s] open the possibility for the introduction of bias.”</p><p>These are pretty fundamental methodological problems and probably help explain how the USDA has somehow managed to avoid the entire scientific literature on low-carbohydrate diets since at least 2014.</p><h3><strong>The 2015 guidelines: Formal Review of Low-carb Is Hidden</strong></h3><p><span>The day before Thanksgiving, 2014, USDA nutritionist Eve Essery </span><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/461105141/US-Department-of-Health-Human-Services-first-interim-response-to-my-FOIA-requests-16-0040-FOIA-16-0226-FOIA-4-28-16" rel="">brought up the subject</a><a id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" rel="">5</a><span> of low-carb diets with members of the outside expert group, called the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC), which by law is intended to direct the scientific reviews. Essery writes:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>As you all know, there has been a continued, and perhaps growing, interest in low-carbohydrate diets, and we have been asked on numerous occasions why the Dietary Guidelines do not recommend low-carbohydrate diets as the dietary pattern of choice to the general public.</span><a id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" rel="">6</a></p></blockquote><p><span>Essery mentions in passing that her USDA colleague, Julie Obbagy, had conducted </span><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/463682498/Low-CHO-Diets-Search-Plan-and-Results" rel="">a review</a><span> of this science,</span><a id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7" rel="">7</a><span> the results of which appear to have been shared with a single member of the DGAC, Anna Maria Siega-Riz, a professor of nutrition at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Essery says Siega-Riz had written up a statement on the topic, to be included in the methodology section of the scientific report.</span></p><p>DGAC member and Harvard professor Frank Hu pipes up to object:</p><blockquote><p><span>I wish that the committee has more time to summarize and update the… evidence on low-carb DIETS [sic]… In any event, </span><strong>we should not simply dismiss the role of low-carb diets</strong><span> in weight control and improving overall health outcomes. [emphases added here and below]</span><a id="footnote-anchor-8" href="#footnote-8" rel="">8</a></p></blockquote><p>Relegating the low-carb discussion to the methodology section would not allow it to be considered alongside other diets, says Hu:</p><blockquote><p><span>“Given the popularity of [a low-carb] pattern and </span><strong>enormous amount of research</strong><span> that has been generated in the past several years, I was wondering if we should have a separate section on low-carb diets rather than</span><strong> burying it in the Methodology section…” </strong></p></blockquote><p>He added:</p><blockquote><p><span>“People who are familiar with the field may complain that we gloss over recent evidence and </span><strong>don’t give low-carb diets…sufficient attention that they deserve</strong><span>.”</span></p></blockquote><p>For several days, Hu and other DGAC members continue to misunderstand that a USDA formal review on low-carb had actually been done—and that they’d just been left out of the loop.</p><p><span>Siega-Riz eventually drives home the point, saying plainly that the USDA “</span><em>did</em><span> </span><em>conduct a review for us</em><span>….” End of conversation—and the review was stuffed.</span></p><h3><strong>The 2020 Guidelines: 40 Studies Forgotten</strong></h3><p><span>The 40 studies in </span><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/463682498/Low-CHO-Diets-Search-Plan-and-Results" rel="">this review</a><span> undoubtedly undercounted the number available at the time.

These data show that a low-carb diet, plus support via a mobile app, can put a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes into remission—safely and sustainably—while eliminating the need for most medications. Only one other nutritional approach, </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1800389" rel="">the Mediterranean diet</a><span>, is supported by 5-year clinical-trial data, and that diet, while moderately reducing cardiovascular risk, has never been shown to put type 2 diabetes into remission or cause significant weight loss. (Also, the diet in this 5-year trial, conducted in Spain, had 40% of calories as fat, not the 32% in the USDA’s “Mediterranean-style” version.)</span></p><p><span>Carbohydrate restriction is currently the only whole-foods approach that can reverse a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It </span><a href="https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12933-018-0698-8" rel="">also improv</a><span>es the vast majority of cardiovascular risk factors.

Disadvantaged populations are especially in need of more choices, as they suffer disproportionately from diet-related diseases and also rely more heavily on food from federally funded programs. But the only way to create change is if the Dietary Guidelines considers low-carb as an option. </span><em>Not a prescription, just an option.</em></p><p>The USDA is at a crossroads. No doubt many of us would like to have greater faith in federal agencies that provide food, healthcare, and dietary guidance to so many people in need. To build confidence, the public needs to see that policy makers are responsive to the people—and the science.</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://unsettledscience.substack.com/p/usda-ignoring-the-science-on-low?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://unsettledscience.substack.com/p/usda-ignoring-the-science-on-low?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
