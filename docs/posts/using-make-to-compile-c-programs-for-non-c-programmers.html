    <h1>Using `make` to compile C programs (for non-C-programmers)</h1>
    
    <p>I have never been a C programmer but every so often I need to compile a C/C++
program from source. This has been kind of a struggle for me: for a
long time, my approach was basically &ldquo;install the dependencies, run <code>make</code>, if
it doesn&rsquo;t work, either try to find a binary someone has compiled or give up&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope someone else has compiled it&rdquo; worked pretty well when I was running Linux
but since I&rsquo;ve been using a Mac for the last couple of years I&rsquo;ve been running
into more situations where I have to actually compile programs myself.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what you might have to do to compile a C program! I&rsquo;ll use
a couple of examples of specific C programs I&rsquo;ve compiled and talk about a few
things that can go wrong. Here are three programs we&rsquo;ll be talking about
compiling:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mj.ucw.cz/sw/paperjam/">paperjam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">sqlite</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.causal.agency/src/tree/bin/qf.c">qf</a> (a pager you can run to quickly open files from a search with <code>rg -n THING | qf</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-install-a-c-compiler">step 1: install a C compiler</h3>
<p>This is pretty simple: on an Ubuntu system if I don&rsquo;t already have a C compiler I&rsquo;ll install one with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre>
<p>This installs <code>gcc</code>, <code>g++</code>, and <code>make</code>. The situation on a Mac is more
confusing but it&rsquo;s something like &ldquo;install xcode command line tools&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-install-the-program-s-dependencies">step 2: install the program&rsquo;s dependencies</h3>
<p>Unlike some newer programming languages, C doesn&rsquo;t have a dependency manager.
So if a program has any dependencies, you need to hunt them down yourself.
Thankfully because of this, C programmers usually keep their dependencies very
minimal and often the dependencies will be available in whatever package manager you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost always a section explaining how to get the dependencies in the
README, for example in <a href="https://mj.ucw.cz/sw/paperjam/">paperjam</a>&rsquo;s README, it
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To compile PaperJam, you need the headers for the libqpdf and libpaper libraries (usually available as libqpdf-dev and libpaper-dev packages).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You may need <code>a2x</code> (found in <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/a2x.1.html">AsciiDoc</a>) for building manual pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So on a Debian-based system you can install the dependencies like this.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install -y libqpdf-dev libpaper-dev
</code></pre>
<p>If a README gives a name for a package (like <code>libqpdf-dev</code>), I&rsquo;d basically
always assume that they mean &ldquo;in a Debian-based Linux distro&rdquo;: if you&rsquo;re on a
Mac <code>brew install libqpdf-dev</code> will not work. I still have not 100% gotten
the hang of developing on a Mac yet so I don&rsquo;t have many tips there yet. I
guess in this case it would be <code>brew install qpdf</code> if you&rsquo;re using Homebrew.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-run-configure-if-needed">step 3: run <code>./configure</code> (if needed)</h3>
<p>Some C programs come with a <code>Makefile</code> and some instead come with a script called
<code>./configure</code>. For example, if you download <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">sqlite&rsquo;s source code</a>, it has a <code>./configure</code> script in
it instead of a Makefile.</p>
<p>My understanding of this <code>./configure</code> script is:</p>
<ol>
<li>You run it, it prints out a lot of somewhat inscrutable output, and then it
either generates a <code>Makefile</code> or fails because you&rsquo;re missing some
dependency</li>
<li>The <code>./configure</code> script is part of a system called
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html">autotools</a>
that I have never needed to learn anything about beyond &ldquo;run it to generate
a <code>Makefile</code>&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think there might be some options you can pass to get the <code>./configure</code>
script to produce a different <code>Makefile</code> but I have never done that.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-run-make">step 4: run <code>make</code></h3>
<p>The next step is to run <code>make</code> to try to build a program. Some notes about
<code>make</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you can run <code>make -j8</code> to parallelize the build and make it go
faster</li>
<li>It usually prints out a million compiler warnings when compiling the program.
I always just ignore them. I didn&rsquo;t write the software! The compiler warnings
are not my problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compiler-errors-are-often-dependency-problems">compiler errors are often dependency problems</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an error I got while compiling <code>paperjam</code> on my Mac:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/homebrew/Cellar/qpdf/12.0.0/include/qpdf/InputSource.hh:85:19: error: function definition does not declare parameters
   85 |     qpdf_offset_t last_offset{0};
      |                   ^
</code></pre>
<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve learned it&rsquo;s usually best not to overthink problems like
this: if it&rsquo;s talking about <code>qpdf</code>, there&rsquo;s a good change it just means that
I&rsquo;ve done something wrong with how I&rsquo;m including the <code>qpdf</code> dependency.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about some ways to get the <code>qpdf</code> dependency included in the right way.</p>
<h3 id="the-world-s-shortest-introduction-to-the-compiler-and-linker">the world&rsquo;s shortest introduction to the compiler and linker</h3>
<p>Before we talk about how to fix dependency problems: building C programs is split into 2
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compiling</strong> the code into <strong>object files</strong> (with <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Linking</strong> those object files into a final binary (with <code>ld</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know this when building a C program because sometimes you
need to pass the right flags to the compiler and linker to tell them where to
find the dependencies for the program you&rsquo;re compiling.</p>
<h3 id="make-uses-environment-variables-to-configure-the-compiler-and-linker"><code>make</code> uses environment variables to configure the compiler and linker</h3>
<p>If I run <code>make</code> on my Mac to install <code>paperjam</code>, I get this error:</p>
<pre><code>c++ -o paperjam paperjam.o pdf-tools.o parse.o cmds.o pdf.o -lqpdf -lpaper
ld: library 'qpdf' not found
</code></pre>
<p>This is not because <code>qpdf</code> is not installed on my system (it actually is!). But
the compiler and linker don&rsquo;t know how to <em>find</em> the <code>qpdf</code> library. To fix this, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>pass <code>&quot;-I/opt/homebrew/include&quot;</code> to the compiler (to tell it where to find the header files)</li>
<li>pass <code>&quot;-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv&quot;</code> to the linker (to tell it where to find library files and to link in <code>iconv</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>And we can get <code>make</code> to pass those extra parameters to the compiler and linker using environment variables!
To see how this works: inside <code>paperjam</code>&rsquo;s Makefile you can see a bunch of environment variables, like <code>LDLIBS</code> here:</p>
<pre><code>paperjam: $(OBJS)
	$(LD) -o $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)
</code></pre>
<p>Everything you put into the <code>LDLIBS</code> environment variable gets passed to the
linker (<code>ld</code>) as a command line argument.</p>
<h3 id="secret-environment-variable-cppflags">secret environment variable: <code>CPPFLAGS</code></h3>
<p><code>Makefiles</code> sometimes define their own environment variables that they pass to
the compiler/linker, but <code>make</code> also has a bunch of &ldquo;implicit&rdquo; environment
variables which it will automatically pass to the C compiler and linker. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Variables.html#index-CFLAGS0">full list of implicit environment variables here</a>,
but one of them is <code>CPPFLAGS</code>, which gets automatically passed to the C compiler.</p>
<p>(technically it would be more normal to use <code>CXXFLAGS</code> for this, but this
particular <code>Makefile</code> hardcodes <code>CXXFLAGS</code> so setting <code>CPPFLAGS</code> was the only
way I could find to set the compiler flags without editing the <code>Makefile</code>)</p>
<small>
As an aside: it took me a long time to realize how closely tied to C/C++ `make` is -- I used
to think that `make` was just a general build system (and of course you can use it for
anything!) but it has a lot of affordances for building C/C++ programs that it
doesn't have for building any other kind of program.
</small>
<h3 id="two-ways-to-pass-environment-variables-to-make">two ways to pass environment variables to <code>make</code></h3>
<p>I learned thanks to <a href="https://www.owlfolio.org/">@zwol</a> that there are actually two ways to pass environment variables to <code>make</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>CXXFLAGS=xyz make</code> (the usual way)</li>
<li><code>make CXXFLAGS=xyz</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The difference between them is that <code>make CXXFLAGS=xyz</code> will override the
value of <code>CXXFLAGS</code> set in the <code>Makefile</code> but <code>CXXFLAGS=xyz make</code> won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which way is the norm but I&rsquo;m going to use the first way in this
post.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-cppflags-and-ldlibs-to-fix-this-compiler-error">how to use <code>CPPFLAGS</code> and <code>LDLIBS</code> to fix this compiler error</h3>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve talked about how <code>CPPFLAGS</code> and <code>LDLIBS</code> get passed to the
compiler and linker, here&rsquo;s the final incantation that I used to get the
program to build successfully!</p>
<pre><code>CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I/opt/homebrew/include&quot; LDLIBS=&quot;-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv&quot; make paperjam
</code></pre>
<p>This passes <code>-I/opt/homebrew/include</code> to the compiler and <code>-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv</code> to the linker.</p>
<p>Also I don&rsquo;t want to pretend that I &ldquo;magically&rdquo; knew that those were the right
arguments to pass, figuring them out involved a bunch of confused Googling that I
skipped over in this post. I will say that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>-I</code> compiler flag tells the compiler which directory to find header files in, like <code>/opt/homebrew/include/qpdf/QPDF.hh</code></li>
<li>the <code>-L</code> linker flag tells the linker which directory to find libraries in, like <code>/opt/homebrew/lib/libqpdf.a</code></li>
<li>the <code>-l</code> linker flag tells the linker which libraries to link in, like <code>-liconv</code> means &ldquo;link in the <code>iconv</code> library&rdquo;, or <code>-lm</code> means &ldquo;link <code>math</code>&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tip-how-to-just-build-1-specific-file-make-filename">tip: how to just build 1 specific file: <code>make $FILENAME</code></h3>
<p>Yesterday I discovered this cool tool called
<a href="https://git.causal.agency/src/tree/bin/qf.c">qf</a> which you can use to quickly
open files from the output of <code>ripgrep</code>.</p>
<p><code>qf</code> is in a big directory of various tools, but I only wanted to compile <code>qf</code>.
So I just compiled <code>qf</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>make qf
</code></pre>
<p>Basically if you know (or can guess) the output filename of the file you&rsquo;re
trying to build, you can tell <code>make</code> to just build that file by running <code>make $FILENAME</code></p>
<h3 id="tip-look-at-how-other-packaging-systems-built-the-same-c-program">tip: look at how other packaging systems built the same C program</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble building a C program, maybe other people had problems building it
too! Every Linux distribution has build files for every package that they
build, so even if you can&rsquo;t install packages from that distribution directly,
maybe you can get tips from that Linux distro for how to build the package.
Realizing this (thanks to my friend Dave) was a huge ah-ha moment for me.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/405624e81a9b65378328accb0a11c3e5369e651c/pkgs/by-name/pa/paperjam/package.nix#L35">this line from the nix package for <code>paperjam</code></a> says:</p>
<pre><code>  env.NIX_LDFLAGS = lib.optionalString stdenv.hostPlatform.isDarwin &quot;-liconv&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>This is basically saying &ldquo;pass the linker flag <code>-liconv</code> to build this on a
Mac&rdquo;, so that&rsquo;s a clue we could use to build it.</p>
<p>That same file also says <code>  env.NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE = &quot;-DPOINTERHOLDER_TRANSITION=1&quot;;</code>. I&rsquo;m not sure what this means, but when I try
to build the <code>paperjam</code> package I do get an error about something called a
<code>PointerHolder</code>, so I guess that&rsquo;s somehow related to the &ldquo;PointerHolder
transition&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-installing-the-binary">step 5: installing the binary</h3>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve managed to compile the program, probably you want to install it somewhere!
Some <code>Makefile</code>s have an <code>install</code> target that let you install the tool on your
system with <code>make install</code>. I&rsquo;m always a bit scared of this (where is it going
to put the files? what if I want to uninstall them later?), so if I&rsquo;m compiling
a pretty simple program I&rsquo;ll often just manually copy the binary to install it
instead, like this:</p>
<pre><code>cp qf ~/bin
</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-6-maybe-make-your-own-package">step 6: maybe make your own package!</h3>
<p>Once I figured out how to do all of this, I realized that I could use my new
<code>make</code> knowledge to contribute a <code>paperjam</code> package to Homebrew! Then I could
just <code>brew install paperjam</code> on future systems.</p>
<p>The good thing is that even if the details of how all of the different
packaging systems, they fundamentally all use C compilers and linkers.</p>
<h3 id="it-can-be-useful-to-understand-a-little-about-c-even-if-you-re-not-a-c-programmer">it can be useful to understand a little about C even if you&rsquo;re not a C programmer</h3>
<p>I think all of this is an interesting example of how it can useful to
understand some basics of how C programs work (like &ldquo;they have header files&rdquo;)
even if you&rsquo;re never planning to write a nontrivial C program if your life.</p>
<p>It feels good to have some ability to compile C/C++ programs myself, even
though I&rsquo;m still not totally confident about all of the compiler and linker
flags and I still plan to never learn anything about how autotools works other
than &ldquo;you run <code>./configure</code> to generate the <code>Makefile</code>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Also one important thing I left out is <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH / DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (which you
use to tell the dynamic linker at runtime where to find dynamically linked
files) because I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I ran into an <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
issue and couldn&rsquo;t find an example.</p>
