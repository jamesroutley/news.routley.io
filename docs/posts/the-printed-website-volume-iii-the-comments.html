<h2>Low-tech Magazine Volume III</h2>
<p>The newest Low-tech Magazine book <a href="https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/kris-de-decker/low-tech-magazine-2018-2021/paperback/product-q7r49d.html">collects 18 articles published between 2018 and 2021</a>. At 368 pages it’s a thin book compared to earlier volumes. When we started the book series, the challenge was to unlock an archive of almost 12 years. It made sense to pack this content into as few volumes as possible.</p>
<p>However, looking ahead, we will publish more often, once every one to three years, depending on the number of articles written. From now on, the articles will be arranged chronologically, from oldest to newest, and no longer the other way around. This volume contains 184 images in black and white.</p>
<h2>Low-tech Magazine: The Comments</h2>
<p>We also launched a book which <a href="https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/kris-de-decker/low-tech-magazine-the-comments-2008-2021/paperback/product-9457rd.html">collects almost 3,000 comments</a> on the roughly 100 articles which are published in the three other books. This volume has 688 pages and no images. We included all feedback up to November 7, 2021. <a href="solar.lowtechmagazine.com/low-tech-magazine-the-printed-comments.html">Read more about the comments book here</a>.</p>
<p>Over the years, readers have often stated that the comments on the website are (at least) as interesting as the articles themselves. We agree. Low-tech Magazine would not have been even half what it is now without the comments. You can even take this literally, because this is one of the thickest books we have published so far, despite the extra small font we use.</p>
<h2>New Edition</h2>
<p>Finally, we have published a <a href="https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/kris-de-decker/low-tech-magazine-2012-2018-second-edition/paperback/product-zvz55m.html">second edition of the first book we published</a> in 2019. This new edition has almost twice as many images and follows the same design as the other volumes. In contrast to the first edition, the images are not “dithered” and of higher quality. We use a smaller font to pack more content on fewer pages. This second edition also fixes some errors in the articles and the references.</p>

<h2>Print on Demand</h2>
<p>The books are printed on demand, meaning that there are no unsold copies (and no large upfront investment costs). Our <span class="caps">US</span> publisher Lulu.com works with printers all over the world, so that most copies are produced locally and travel relatively short distances. Note that it takes 3 to 5 work days to print the book.</p>
