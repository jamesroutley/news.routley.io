                           and characterized enzymes that degrade crystalline PET, a plastic used in single-use

                  </figure><p> 
                  What do a T-shirt, a rug, and a soda bottle have in common? Many are made from polyethylene
                  terephthalate (PET), a ubiquitous plastic that revolutionized the materials industry
                  after it was patented in the 1940s.
               </p>
               
               <p>Created from petroleum refining, PET is a material known for its durability and versatility.
                  It is easily molded into airtight containers, woven into durable carpets, or spun
                  into polyester clothing.
               </p>
               
               <p>“The reality is that most PET products—especially PET clothing and carpeting—are not
                  recycled today using conventional recycling technologies,” explained Gregg Beckham,
                  senior research fellow at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and CEO
                  of the U.S. Department of Energy BOTTLE Consortium. “The research community is developing
                  promising alternatives, including enzymes designed to depolymerize PET, but even these
                  options have tended to lean on energy-intensive and costly preprocessing steps to
                  be effective.”
               </p>
               
               <p>As a result, most PET produced today eventually finds its way into landfills or the
                  environment—even PET products that actually make it into the recycling bin.
               </p>
               
               <p>Still, Beckham said that narrative is changing quickly. Advanced methods in machine
                  learning and synthetic biology have given scientists an unprecedented look into the
                  fundamental biology of PET-deconstructing enzymes. As detailed in an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35237-x">article published in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>, Beckham and colleagues at University of Portsmouth and Montana State University
                  used these methods to discover new enzyme variants that show promise at deconstructing
                  even the toughest PET without extra preprocessing.
               </p>
               
               <p>Not only could that mean we are on the cusp of enzymatic recycling for all forms of
                  PET, including carpeting and clothing—it means it could soon be cheaper to recycle
                  PET than making it from scratch with petroleum.
               </p>
               
               <h2>Extraordinary Enzymes Hidden in the Dirt</h2>
               
               <p>The concept of enzymatic recycling of PET has been known since 2005, but it surged
                  onto the world stage in 2016 after Japanese scientists made a surprising discovery.
                  Buried in the dirt outside a recycling facility in Japan, a bacterium they dubbed
                  <em>Ideonella sakaiensis</em> was quietly secreting enzymes that were deconstructing old plastic beverage bottles
                  scattered about.
               </p>
               
               <p>Nature had provided an elegant solution for cleaving the chemical bonds of PET. Somehow,
                  nature was demonstrating how to turn PET bottles back to the basic components from
                  which they were made: terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.
               </p>
               
               <p>A flurry of research followed. Scientists sought to enhance the enzymes for use in
                  industrial technologies equipped to deal with the millions of tons of PET produced
                  every year. If improved, they hypothesized, an enzymatic recycling platform could
                  overhaul today’s underperforming recycling systems, reduce energy and greenhouse gas
                  emissions, and foster a circular economy for all PET products—even carpeting and fabrics
                  not recyclable with conventional technologies.
               </p>
               
               <p>“The scientific literature lit up with new papers from all over the world as researchers
                  realized the potential of utilizing enzymes to break down plastics,” said John McGeehan,
                  a scientist who led the contribution from the team at the University of Portsmouth
                  (UoP) in the United Kingdom. “Experts from fields as diverse as pharma and biofuels
                  were able to repurpose decades of research experience engineering enzymes.”
               </p>

                     </div><p> 
                     Indeed, Beckham, McGeehan, and colleagues were themselves core players in the global effort
                  to improve enzymatic PET recycling. In a series of frequently cited papers published
                  between 2018 and 2021, the team <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2018/research-team-engineers-a-better-plastic-degrading-enzyme.html">characterized the enzymes</a>, <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2020/nrel-uk-partner-dive-deeper-into-how-enzymes-digest-plastic.html">improved their efficiency sixfold</a>, and analyzed the <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2021/analysis-shows-enzyme-based-plastics-recycling-is-more-energy-efficient-better-for-environment.html">environmental and economic impact of industrial-scale PET recycling</a>. A corresponding 2022 paper assessed <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2GC02162E">life cycle impacts for a future enzymatic PET recycling</a> system.
               </p>
               
               <p>Those studies earned measurable results. By treating PET for 48 hours in a bioreactor,
                  they showed it was possible to transform nearly 98% of the plastic back into terephthalic
                  acid and ethylene glycol—high-quality recycled building blocks for making new PET
                  bottles or even advanced plastics designed to be more easily recyclable.
               </p>
               
               <p>“It was an incredible experience to be in a field that was expanding so quickly,” McGeehan
                  added. “We are reaching a point where collaborative science has huge potential to
                  accelerate the development and rollout of enzyme-based solutions at scale.”
               </p>
               
               <p>Despite rapid advances, though, a key barrier to industrial-scale enzymatic recycling
                  loomed.
               </p>
               
               <p>The enzymes were only effective on a small percentage of PET products—those made from
                  “amorphous” PET. They struggled to deconstruct the highly common, durable “crystalline”
                  varieties of PET without first softening them with high heat and extra energy. Crystalline
                  PET comprises nearly 90% of all PET produced, including polyester fibers in clothing
                  and parts of single-use beverage bottles.
               </p>
               
               <p>What the scientists needed were enzymes more adept at breaking down crystalline PET.
                  If only they could find other plastic-eating enzymes hidden somewhere in the dirt.
               </p>
               
               <h2>“Digging” for New Enzymes With Machine Learning</h2>
               
               <p>Fortunately, the team did not need a shovel to dig for new enzyme varieties. Advances
                  in bioinformatics and machine learning had already made it possible to prospect vast
                  databases of existing enzyme sequences for varieties active on crystalline PET.
               </p>
               
               <p>“Traditional approaches to map out new plastic-eating enzymes from databases can be
                  ineffective, since enzymes that are very similar in their chemical makeup may not
                  necessarily retain the plastic deconstruction activity,” said NREL computational scientist
                  Japheth Gado.
               </p>
               
               <p>To get around that challenge, Gado built a statistical model to learn the biological
                  rules of known plastic-deconstructing enzymes. The model assigned probabilities to
                  the unique composition of enzymes studied to date. Gado also built a companion machine-learning
                  model to predict the heat tolerance of enzymes, important for industrial applications.
               </p>

                        <figcaption>
                           <p>3D renderings by DeepMind revealed unexpected structural features, such as in enzyme
                              611, pictured here. Carefully analyzing the structural characteristics of proteins
                              like enzyme 611 could help the research team improve their performance.
                           </p>
                        </figcaption>
                     </figure>
                  </div><p> 
                  Together, the two computational models let Gado and colleagues project into the unknown.
                  In less than an hour, they screened over 250 million proteins to create a short list
                  of promising candidates. Further testing confirmed that 36 were able to deconstruct
                  PET, and 24 were previously undescribed in scientific literature.
               </p>
               
               <p>Importantly, several were even better at breaking down crystalline PET than amorphous
                  PET.
               </p>
               
               <p>“Not only are these new enzymes genetically diverse,” Gado explained. &#34;They are structurally
                  diverse with varying geometries of the active sites.”
               </p>
               
               <p>Gado can speak confidently about the structure of the 24 novel enzymes because he
                  has seen what they look like—at least in 3D renderings provided by researchers at
                  DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet. Known for mapping <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02083-2">the “entire protein universe”</a> with its deep-learning tool AlphaFold, DeepMind characterized the enzymes so the
                  team could compare the enzymes side by side and note their differences.
               </p>
               
               <p>All were capable of deconstructing PET, but several looked strikingly different from
                  one another. According to Gado, the renderings from DeepMind provide invaluable clues
                  into how plastic-deconstructing enzymes act on PET.
               </p>
               
               <p>“State-of-the-art AI methods help us find patterns in the enzyme data that will provide
                  enhanced understanding on what makes a good plastic-eating enzyme,” Gado added. “This
                  will enable us to improve the enzymes with protein engineering and to find other enzymes
                  in nature that are similar in terms of performance.”
               </p>
               
               <p>It was another advance from an already prolific research team and one step closer
                  to realizing PET recycling at scale.
               </p>
               
               <h2>Cheaper and Greener—Analysis Quantifies Advantages of Enzymatic PET Recycling</h2>
               
               <p>Cleaning, shredding, and heating—steps needed to prepare PET for deconstruction—are
                  among the most important sustainability drivers of an industrial-scale enzymatic recycling
                  facility, according to Beckham.
               </p>
               
               <p>“Minimizing these preprocessing steps is critical for making enzymatic recycling cost
                  competitive with creating PET resin from petroleum,” he explained.
               </p>

                        <figcaption>
                           <p>Scientists at NREL and UoP developed a cost-effective, environmentally friendly enzymatic
                              platform that rapidly deconstructs post-consumer PET back into its same chemical building
                              blocks, terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). <em>Figure by Elizabeth Stone, NREL</em></p>
                        </figcaption>
                     </figure>
                  </div><p> 
                  In follow-up experiments, the team noted that some of the enzymes flagged by their
                  machine learning methods were equally effective at breaking down crystalline and amorphous
                  PET. Those enzymes simply did not need preprocessing to help soften the bonds of the
                  plastic.
               </p>
               
               <p>“By cutting out preprocessing, the technology could enable industrial-scale PET recycling
                  that is actually cheaper than virgin PET production using petroleum,” Beckham added.
                  “Even better, it can lower associated energy and greenhouse gas emissions.”
               </p>
               
               <p>In an earlier article published in <em>Joule</em> in 2021, the team had already quantified the economic and environmental advantages
                  of using enzymes active on crystalline PET. At an industrial-scale facility, doing
                  so could reduce supply chain energy requirements by 45% and life-cycle greenhouse
                  gas emissions by 38% compared to systems using preprocessing.
               </p>
               
               <p>The economic advantages are equally as impressive. When deconstructing waste PET carpeting
                  and clothing—unrecyclable with conventional technologies—they could also produce terephthalic
                  acid for less than $1 per kilogram. Petroleum-derived terephthalic acid has historically
                  sold for between $1 and $1.50 per kilogram.
               </p>
               
               <p>“Our enzymatic platform creates an economic incentive for cleaning up our oceans,”
                  said Erika Erickson, a former NREL postdoctoral researcher who conducted much of the
                  experimental work behind the studies. “At such a price point, PET pollution can be
                  affordably recycled into new PET products or find a new purpose in wind turbine blades
                  or carbon fiber bumpers.”
               </p>
               
               <p>Post-consumer PET products, often a source of pollution today, can be transformed
                  into valuable resources to support a more environmentally sustainable plastics economy.
               </p>
               
               <p>It is not difficult to imagine how this might flip the narrative on the plastic: PET
                  so cheap to recycle that economics favor tossing it in the recycling bin over the
                  trash can. A T-shirt, a rug, a soda bottle—all go in and begin their circular journey
                  as building blocks to create a cleaner, greener world.
