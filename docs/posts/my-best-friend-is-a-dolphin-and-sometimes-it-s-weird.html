<div><p><i>&#34;In your first conversations with them, you’ll probably want to refer to all you’ve learned in the past year’s intensive study of dolphin history, culture, and ritual.  Maybe you want to put them at ease, or maybe you kind of want to show off.  I’m telling you not to do that, because <b>you know nothing</b>.&#34;</i> The science fiction short story <a href="https://sockdolager.net/share-your-flavor/">&#34;Share Your Flavor&#34; by Jenifer K. Leigh</a> has a fun friendship between a human and a dolphin who commiserate about their relationship issues.</p>
