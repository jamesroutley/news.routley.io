    <h1>Migrating tools as a test of data portability</h1>

    <p>My <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/2024/07/30/tool-changes-log.html">last post</a> talked about how I’ve added some process and, by proxy, resistance, to migrating around between tools that I use. I wanted to follow up on this, as there was an implication that spending time migrating between tools was lost time that I think merits more nuance.</p>

<p>The origin of this train of thought came from a migration I’ve been doing from TiddlyWiki to Obsidian as my personal note-taking software. The initial process for migrating was essentially exporting Markdown files from TiddlyWiki to Obsidian, with a touch of transformation along the way to adapt to a slightly different <code>[[wikilink]]</code> behavior. What struck me about this migration is that it only took me a day or so to get to a point where I was able to pick up where I left off with TiddlyWiki using Obsidian, links and all.</p>

<p>This smooth migration sparked a thought about data longevity: the simplicity and portability of the data format seemed to matter more than the longevity of the tool I was using to take my notes. I’d even go as far as saying that I’m happy I did this migration, if anything because it acted as a test for Markdown’s portability as a note-taking format built for the long-haul.</p>

<p>The only thing that <em>didn’t</em> translate well were dynamically generated pages in my notes, which needed to be written in a very software-specific way that didn’t directly transfer from TiddlyWiki to Obisidian. Specifically, TiddlyWiki widgets/filters are incompatible with Obsidian Dataview queries, and the former needed to be re-written in the latter. This wasn’t a huge deal given that I don’t use these dynamically generated pages too frequently, however this migration made me realize that I need to be careful when relying too heavily on features that are specific to one tool.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that these features should <em>never</em> be used, more so that their convenience needs to be properly weighed against their cost (in the form of lock-in). Plugins like Obsidian Dataview are incredibly convenient, but it’s unrealistic to expect it to be around and functional decades from now.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> At least not at the same level of stability I’d expect Markdown to be.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that you should rush out and scramble your stable tooling for note-keeping or a lifetime’s worth of photos. Rather, if you do happen to be in a position where you’re looking to make a change it could <em>also</em> serve as a way to boost (or hamper) your confidence in your data’s portability and longevity. Think of it like periodically testing your backups.</p>
