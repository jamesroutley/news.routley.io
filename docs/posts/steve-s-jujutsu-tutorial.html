<p>Hi there, I&#39;m <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/">Steve</a>. This is a tutorial for <a href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj">Jujutsuâ€”a version control
system</a>.</p>
<p>This tutorial exists because of a particular quirk of mine: I love to write
tutorials about things as I learn them. This is the backstory of
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">TRPL</a>, of which an ancient draft was
&#34;<a href="https://github.com/steveklabnik/rust_for_rubyists">Rust for Rubyists</a>.&#34; You only get to look at a problem as a beginner
once, and so I think writing this stuff down is interesting. It also helps me
clarify what I&#39;m learning to myself.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have been interested in version control for a long time. I feel like
I am the only person alive who doesn&#39;t mind <code>git</code>&#39;s CLI. That&#39;s weird. I also
heard friends rave about &#34;stacked diffs&#34; but struggled to understand what exactly
was going on there. Nothing I read or conversations I had have clicked.</p>
<p>One time I was talking with <a href="https://github.com/sunshowers">Rain</a> about this and
she mentioned <code>jj</code> being very cool. I looked at it but I didn&#39;t get it. I decided
to maybe just come back to this topic later. A very common thing people have when
learning Rust is, they&#39;ll try it, quit in frustration, and then come back months
later and it&#39;s easy and they don&#39;t know what they were struggling with. Of course,
some people never try again, and some who try don&#39;t get over the hump, but this
used to happen quite often, enough to be remarkable. So that&#39;s what I decided
with <code>jj</code>. I&#39;d figure this stuff out later.</p>
<p>Well, recently <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/essays/jj-init/">Chris Krycho wrote an article about jj</a>. I liked it. I
didn&#39;t fully grok everything, but it at least felt like I could understand this
thing finally maybe. I didn&#39;t install it, but just sat with it for a while.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if that is why, but I awoke unusually early one morning. I
couldn&#39;t get back to sleep. Okay. Fine. Let&#39;s do this. I opened up <a href="https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/v0.13.0/tutorial/">the official
jj tutorial</a>, installed <code>jj</code>, made this repository on GitHub, followed
the &#34;cloning a git repo&#34; instructions to pull it down, and started this mdBook.</p>
<p>What follows is exactly what the title says: it&#39;s to teach me <code>jj</code>. I am
publishing this just in case someone might find it interesting. I am very excited
about <code>jj</code>. I feel like I&#39;m getting it. Maybe your brain will work like mine,
and this will be useful to you. But also, it may not. I make no claim that this
tutorial is good, complete, or even accurate.</p>

issues or even send me pull requests for typos and such. Zero guarantees I will
respond in a timely fashion though.</p>
<p>Anyway, let&#39;s get on with it.</p>
