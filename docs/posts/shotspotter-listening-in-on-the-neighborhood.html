    <h1>ShotSpotter: listening in on the neighborhood</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>Last week, someone leaked a spreadsheet of SoundThinking sensors to
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/shotspotter-secret-sensor-locations-leak/">Wired</a>.
You are probably asking &#34;What is SoundThinking,&#34; because the company rebranded
last year. They used to be called ShotSpotter, and their outdoor acoustic
gunfire detection system still goes by the ShotSpotter name.</p>
<p>ShotSpotter has attracted a lot of press and plenty of criticism for the
gunfire detection service they provide to many law enforcement agencies in the
US. The system involves installing acoustic sensors throughout a city, which
use some sort of signature matching to detect gunfire and then use time of
flight to determine the likely source.</p>
<p>One of the principle topics of criticism is the immense secrecy with which they
operate: ShotSpotter protects information on the location of its sensors as if
it were state secret, and does not disclose them even to the law enforcement
agencies that are its customers. This secrecy attracts accusations that
ShotSpotter&#39;s claims of efficacy cannot be independently validated, and that
ShotSpotter is attempting to suppress research into the civil rights impacts of
its product.</p>
<p>I have encountered this topic before: the Albuquerque Police Department is a
ShotSpotter customer, and during my involvement in police oversight was evasive
in response to any questions about the system and resisted efforts to subject
its surveillance technology purchases to more outside scrutiny. Many assumed
that ShotSpotter coverage was concentrated in disadvantaged parts of the city,
an unsurprising outcome but one that could contribute to systemic overpolicing.
APD would not comment.</p>
<p>I have always assumed that it would not really be that difficult to find the
ShotSpotter sensors, at least if you have my inclination to examine telephone
poles. While the Wired article focuses heavily on sensors installed on
buildings, it seems likely that in environments like Albuquerque with
city-operated lighting and a single electrical utility, they would be installed
on street lights. That&#39;s where you find most of the technology the city fields.</p>
<p>The thing is, I didn&#39;t really know what the sensors looked like. I&#39;ve seen
pictures, but I know they were quite old, and I assumed the design had gotten
more compact over time. Indeed it has.</p>
<p><img alt="ShotSpotter sensor on light pole" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/1.jpg"/></p>
<p>An interesting thing about the Wired article is that it contains a map, but
the MapBox embed produced with Flourish Studio had a surprisingly high maximum
zoom level. That made it more or less impossible to interpret the locations of
the sensors exactly. I&#39;m concerned that this was an intentional decision by
Wired to partially obfuscate the data, because it is not an effective one. It
was a simple matter to find the JSON payload the map viewer was using for the
PoI overlay and then convert it to KML.</p>
<p>I worried that the underlying data would be obscured; it was not. The
coordinates are exact. So, I took the opportunity to enjoy a nice day and went
on an expedition.</p>
<p><img alt="ShotSpotter sensor in a neighborhood" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/2.jpg"/></p>
<p>The sensors are pretty much what I imagined, innocuous beige boxes clamped to
street light arms. There are a number of these boxes to be found in modern
cities. Some are smart meter nodes, some are base stations for municipal data
networks, others collect environmental data. Some are the police, listening in
on your activities.</p>
<p>This is not as hypothetical of a concern as it might sound. Conversations
recorded by ShotSpotter sensors have twice been introduced as evidence in
criminal trials. In <a href="https://casetext.com/case/people-v-johnson-5116">one case</a>
the court allowed it, in
<a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2018/01/08/CRIMINAL%20ESI%20DEC%202017.pdf">another</a>
the court did not.  The possibility clearly exists, and depending on
interpretation of state law, it may be permissible for ShotSpotter to record
conversations on the street for future use as evidence.</p>
<p><img alt="ShotSpotter sensor in a neighborhood" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/3.jpg"/></p>
<p>This ought to give us pause, as should the fact that ShotSpotter has been
compellingly demonstrated to
<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8xbq/police-are-telling-shotspotter-to-alter-evidence-from-gunshot-detecting-ai">manipulate</a>
their &#34;interpretation&#34; of evidence to fit a prosecutor&#39;s narrative---even when
ShotSpotter&#39;s original analysis contradicted it.</p>
<p>But pervasive surveillance of urban areas and troubling use of that evidence
is nothing new. Albuquerque already has an expansive police-operated video
surveillance network connected to the Real-Time Crime Center. APD has long
used portable automated license plate readers (ALPR) under cover of &#34;your
speed is&#34; trailers, and more recently has installed permanent ALPR at major
intersections in the city.</p>
<p>All of this occurs with virtually no public oversight or even public awareness.</p>
<p><img alt="ShotSpotter sensor in a neighborhood" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/4.jpg"/></p>
<p>What most surprised me is the density of ShotSpotter sensors. In my head, I
assumed they were fairly sparse. A Chicago report on the system says there are
20 to 25 per square mile. Density in Albuquerque is lower, probably reflecting
the wide streets and relative lack of high rises. Still, there are a lot of
them. 721 in Albuquerque, a city of about 190 square miles. At present, only
parts of the city are covered.</p>
<p><img alt="Map of ShotSpotter sensors in Albuquerque" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/map.jpg"/></p>
<p>And those coverage decisions are interesting. The valley (what of it is in city
limits) is well covered, as is the west side outside of Coors/Old Coors. The
International District, of course, is dense with sensors, as is inner NE
bounded by roughly by the freeways to Louisiana and Montgomery.</p>
<p>Conspicuously empty is the rest of the northeast, from UNM&#39;s north campus
area to the foothills. Indian School Road makes almost its entire east side
length without any sensors. </p>
<p><img alt="ShotSpotter sensor in a neighborhood" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/5.jpg"/></p>
<p>The reader can probably infer how this coverage pattern relates to race and
class in Albuquerque. It&#39;s not perfect, but the distance from your house to a
ShotSpotter sensor correlates fairly well with your household income. The
wealthier you are, the less surveilled you are.</p>
<p>The &#34;pocket of poverty&#34; south of Downtown where I live, the historically
Spanish Barelas and historically Black South Broadway, are predictably
well covered. All of the photos here were taken within a mile, and I did not
come even close to visiting all of the sensors. Within a one mile radius of
the center of Barelas, there are 31 sensors.</p>
<p><img alt="ShotSpotter sensor in a neighborhood" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/6.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some are conspicuous. Washington Middle School, where 13-year-old Bennie
Hargrove was shot by another student, has a sensor mounted at its front
entrance. Another sensor is in the cul de sac behind the Coors and I-40
Walmart, where a body was found in a burned-out car. Perhaps the deep gulch of
the freeway poses a coverage challenge, there are two more less than a thousand
feet away.</p>
<p>In the Downtown Core, buildings were preferred to light poles. The
PNM building, the Anasazi condos, and the Banque building are all feeding data
into the city&#39;s failing scheme of federal prosecutions for downtown gun crime.</p>
<p>The closest sensor to the wealthy Heights is at Embudo Canyon, and coverage
stops north of Central in the affluent Nob Hill residential area. Old Town is
almost completely uncovered, as is the isolationist Four Hills.</p>
<p>Highland High School has a sensor on its swimming pool building. The data says
there are two at the intersection of Gibson and Chavez, probably an error, it
also says there are two sensors on &#34;Null Island.&#34; Don&#39;t worry about coverage in
the south campus area, though. There are 16 in the area bounded by I-25 to Yale
and Gibson to Coal.</p>

APD PIO Gallegos saying &#34;We don&#39;t know, technically, where all the sensors are.&#34;
Well, I suppose they do now, the leak has been widely reported on. APD received
about 14,000 ShotSpotter reports last year. The accuracy of these reports, in
terms of their correctly identifying gunfire, is contested. SoundThinking
claims impressive statistics, but has actively resisted independent
evaluation. A Chicago report found that only 11.3% of ShotSpotter reports could
be confirmed as gunfire. APD, for its part, reports a few hundred suspects or
victims identified as a result of ShotSpotter reports.</p>
<p>APD has used a local firearms training business, Calibers, to fire blanks
around the city to verify detection. They say the system performed well.</p>
<p>But, if asked, they provide a form letter written by ShotSpotter. Their
contract prohibits the disclosure of any actual data.</p>
