    <h1>California halts Pony.ai&#39;s driverless testing permit after accident</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article dir="ltr"><div><p>SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 13 (Reuters) - A California regulator on Monday said it has suspended a driverless testing permit for startup technology firm Pony.ai following an accident - the first time it has issued such a suspension.</p><p>On Oct. 28, a Pony.ai vehicle operating in autonomous mode hit a road center divider and a traffic sign in Fremont after turning right, showed the technology firm’s accident report filed with the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).</p><p>“There were no injuries and no other vehicles involved,” the company, backed by Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp, said in the report.</p><p>Accidents during driverless testing are not uncommon. It was unclear what aspect of this incident prompted the suspension.</p><p>“On Nov. 19, the DMV notified Pony.ai that the department is suspending its driverless testing permit, effective immediately, following a reported solo collision in Fremont, California, on Oct. 28,” the DMV said in a statement.</p><p>The regulator said Pony.ai has 10 Hyundai Motor Co Kona electric vehicles registered under its driverless testing permit, and that the suspension does not impact Pony.ai’s permit for testing with a safety driver.</p><p>The suspension comes only six months after Pony.ai became the eighth company to receive a driverless testing permit in California, joining the likes of Alphabet Inc unit Waymo as well as Cruise, backed by General Motors Co.</p><p>“We are cooperating with the California DMV and look forward to addressing and resolving any concerns they may have,” Pony.ai said in a statement. Safety is the “foundation” of its autonomous vehicle technology, the firm said.</p><p>“The majority of Pony.ai’s testing has been, and will continue to be in the near-term, drivered autonomous testing,” said the company, which operates in the United States and China.</p><p>Pony.ai earlier this year suspended plans for a New York stock listing, sources told Reuters. The firm could not gain assurances from Chinese authorities that it would not become a target of increased regulatory action against Chinese technology companies over management and use of user data, sources said.
