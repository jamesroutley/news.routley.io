    <h1>I&#39;ve locked myself out of my digital life</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
<p>Imagine…</p><p>Last night, lightning struck our house and burned it down. I escaped wearing only my nightclothes.</p><p>In an instant, everything was vaporised. Laptop? Cinders. Phone? Ashes. Home server? A smouldering wreck. Yubikey? A charred chunk of gristle.</p><p>This presents something of a problem.</p><p>In order to recover my digital life, I need to be able to log in to things. This means I need to know my usernames (easy) and my passwords (hard). All my passwords are stored in a Password Manager. I <em>can</em> remember the password to that.  But logging in to the manager <em>also</em> requires a 2FA code.  Which is generated by my phone.</p><p>The phone which now looks like this:</p><p><img src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Melted-Phone.webp" alt="A melted phone.

I regularly exported my TOTP secrets and saved them in an encrypted file on my cloud storage - ready to be loaded onto a new phone.</p><p>But to get into my cloud, I need my password and 2FA.  And even if I could convince the cloud provider to bypass that and let me in, the backup is secured with a password which is stored in - you guessed it - my Password Manager.</p><p>I am in cyclic dependency hell.  To get my passwords, I need my 2FA. To get my 2FA, I need my passwords.</p><p>Perhaps I can use my MFA FIDO2 Key?</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/key-melted.jpg" alt="A melted security key. Photo taken from  A Side Journey To Titan: Revealing and Breaking NXP&#39;s P5x ECDSA Implementation on the Way." width="411" height="231"/></p><p>Oh.</p><p>Various services allow a user to designate an &#34;emergency contact&#34;. Someone who can access your account <i lang="la">in extremis</i>. Who do you trust enough with the keys to your digital life?</p><p>I chose my wife.</p><p>The wife who lives with me in the same house. And, obviously, has just lost all her worldly possessions in a freak lightning strike.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ShadowRidgeRoadFire.jpg" alt="Photo of a house engulfed in flames. Photo taken by Wikimedia user LukeBam06." width="512" height="384"/></p><p>Oh.</p><h2 id="recovery-codes"><a href="#recovery-codes">Recovery Codes</a></h2><p>Most online services which have Multi-Factor Authentication, also provide &#34;recovery codes&#34;. They are, in effect, one-time override passwords.  A group of random characters which will bypass any security. Each can only be used once, and then is immediately revoked.</p><p>I was clever. I hand-wrote the codes on a piece of paper (so they can&#39;t be recovered from my printer&#39;s memory!) and stored them in a fire-proof safe, secured with a key hidden under the cat&#39;s litter-box.</p><p>Sadly, the fire-proof safe wasn&#39;t lightning-strike safe and is now obliterated. Along with the cat&#39;s litter-box. The cat is fine.</p><p>I know… I know… I <em>should</em> have kept them in a lock-box in my local bank. The only problem is, <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/ask-an-expert-my-bank-isnt-providing-safe-deposit-boxes-anymore-where-can-i-get-one-aTFbh0i7nezo">virtually no banks offer safe deposit boxes in the UK</a>. The one that does charges <a href="https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/safe-deposit-boxes/">£240 per year</a>. A small price to pay, for some, to avoid irreversible loss. But it adds up to a significant ongoing cost.</p><p>But, suppose I had stored everything off-site. All I&#39;d need to do is walk up to the bank and show some ID which proved that I was the authorised user of that box.</p><p>The ID which has just been sacrificed in tribute to mighty Thor and now looks like a melted waxwork.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/swestdahl/status/1533504584328523776"><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/meltedID.png" alt="An AI generated image of a melted driver&#39;s licence." width="384" height="208"/></a></p><p>Oh.</p><h2 id="friendly-neighbourhood-storage"><a href="#friendly-neighbourhood-storage">Friendly Neighbourhood Storage</a></h2><p>Perhaps what I <em>should</em> have done is stored all my backup codes and recovery keys on a USB stick and then given them to a friend?</p><p>There are a few problems with that.</p><ol><li>Every time I sign up to a new service, I would need to add it to the USB stick. How many times can I pop round with a fresh stick before it becomes an imposition?</li><li>What if my friend (or their kid) accidentally wipes the drive?</li><li>If a freak lightning storms hits both our houses at the same time, I still lose everything.</li><li>Even if I did all that, I would have to give the USB stick a strong password to make sure my friend didn&#39;t betray me. So I either need to remember that, or I&#39;m stuck in the password-manager-paradox.</li></ol><p>Perhaps I could split the USB sticks between multiple friends using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir&#39;s Secret Sharing</a>? That solves some problems - mostly the accidental losses and remembering a strong password - but creates <em>even more</em> issues. Now I have to do a lot more admin <em>and</em> worry about all my friends conspiring against me!</p><h2 id="phone-home"><a href="#phone-home">Phone Home</a></h2><p>One of the weakest forms of identity is the humble phone number. Several of my accounts use my mobile number to text me authorisation codes. SMS isn&#39;t the most secure way to deliver passwords - it can be intercepted or the SIM can swapped to one controlled by an attacker. But, <em>if</em> I can get my phone number back, I stand a chance of getting in to my email and perhaps some other services.</p><p>That&#39;s a weakness in my security posture. But one I may need to take advantage of.</p><p>The only question is - how do I prove to the staff at my local phone shop that I am the rightful owner of a SIM card which is now little more than soot? Perhaps I can just rock up and say &#34;Don&#39;t you know who I am?!?!&#34;</p><p>I know, I&#39;ll show them my passport!</p><p><a title="Santeri Viinamäki, CC BY-SA 4.0 &lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burning_EU_passport_20180318.jpg"><img width="512" alt="Burning EU passport 20180318" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Burning_EU_passport_20180318.jpg/512px-Burning_EU_passport_20180318.jpg"/></a></p><p>Oh.</p><h2 id="bootstrapping-of-trust"><a href="#bootstrapping-of-trust">Bootstrapping of trust</a></h2><p>I am lucky. I have a nice middle-class life and know lots of professionals - doctors, lawyers, teachers - who I <em>hope</em> would be happy to vouch for me.  I could use one of my friends to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/confirm-identity-online-for-passport-application">confirm my identity for a replacement passport</a>.  Once I have a passport, I should be able to get a SIM card with my phone number. And, I hope, some online services.</p><p>I would, however, need to use a credit or debit card to apply for a replacement passport. But all of my cards are melted to slag - and I can&#39;t prove to the bank that I am who I say I am because I don&#39;t know my account number, password, or mother&#39;s maiden name.</p><p>You see, I was &#34;clever&#34; and took some idiot&#39;s advice about <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/11/why-lying-is-essential-for-privacy-herd-immunity/">setting your mother&#39;s maiden name to being a random string of characters</a>. Those details are, of course, stored in my inaccessible password manager!</p><p>Hopefully one of my friends will be prepared to lend me the £75.50 to get a new passport.</p><p>I&#39;ll just call up one of my friends. Hmmm… now, where did I store their phone number?</p><p><img src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Melted-Phone.webp" alt="A melted phone. Credit: Reddit user Crushader." width="720" height="480"/></p><p>Oh.</p><h2 id="starting-over"><a href="#starting-over">Starting over</a></h2><p>Again, I&#39;m lucky. I live relatively close to some friends and family. And I&#39;m confident that they&#39;d be gracious enough to pay an emergency cab fare if I started hammering on their door at silly o&#39;clock in the morning.</p><p>With their help, I think I could probably call up enough insurance companies to figure out which one covered the property. I would hope the insurance company would have some way of validating with the emergency services that the house is, indeed, a smoking crater.  I don&#39;t know if that would get me emergency cash, or if I&#39;d have to rely on friends until I get access to my bank account.</p><p>I assume my credit card companies can probably be convinced to send out replacement cards. But will they also be willing to change my address - or will the card go to the pile of ashes which was formerly my home?</p><p>I don&#39;t know whether my insurance policy covers me for access to digital files. Even if it did, I&#39;m not sure how they can force a company like - say - Google to give me access to my account. It isn&#39;t like Google went through a KYC (Know Your Customer) process when I signed up.</p><h2 id="code-is-law"><a href="#code-is-law">Code Is Law</a></h2><p>This is where we reach the limits of the &#34;Code Is Law&#34; movement.</p><p>In the boring analogue world - I am pretty sure that I&#39;d be able to convince a human that I am who I say I am. And, thus, get access to my accounts.  I may have to go to court to force a company to give me access back, but it is <em>possible</em>.</p><p>But when things are secured by an unassailable algorithm - I am out of luck. No amount of pleading will let me without the correct credentials.  The company which provides my password manager simply doesn&#39;t have access to my passwords. There is no-one to convince. Code is law.</p><p>Of course, if I can wangle my way past security, an evil-doer could also do so.</p><p>So which is the bigger risk:</p><ul><li>An impersonator who convinces a service provider that they are me?</li><li>A malicious insider who works for a service provider?</li><li>Me permanently losing access to all of my identifiers?</li></ul><p>I don&#39;t know the answer to that. If you have a strong opinion, please let me know in the comment section.</p><p>In the meantime, please rest assured that my home is still standing.
