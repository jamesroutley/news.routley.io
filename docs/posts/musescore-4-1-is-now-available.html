We are delighted to announce our first major update to MuseScore 4 since it launched last year.
</p>
<p>
This update includes a significant upgrade to our playback engine (making the app run more efficiently) plus new features for harp and guitar notation, the ability to customise ornaments, new auxiliary channel strips in the mixer, and hundreds of engraving improvements and bug fixes, plus much more!
</p>
<p>
A huge thank you to the dedicated MuseScore community for supporting this release with implementation, testing and translating. We hope you enjoy this latest version and are excited to hear your feedback!
</p>
<p>
All the best from,
</p>
<p>
