    <h1>RC Weeknotes 03</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/recurse-init">joining the Recurse Center (RC)</a>, I’ve been posting about the process, my projects, and what I’m learning. See all the <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/tags/weeknotes">weekly installments</a> or filter for posts with the <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/tags/recurse">Recurse tag</a>.</p><hr/><p>tldr;</p><p>This was a lighter-touch week for me on the social and meeting fronts. I also took a bit more time away to consolidate, touch grass, and sail boats.</p><p>The main highlight was the fun hedgehog game I made in the Creative Coding session. You can <a href="https://with-or-without-you.vercel.app">play it here</a> and check out <a href="https://github.com/gianlucatruda/with-or-without-you-game">the code</a>. Let me know if you beat my high score of 46.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.nongnu.org/lwip/2_1_x/images/wowy-game-demo.gif" alt="GIF of With or without you game, hedgehog jumping"/></p><hr/><h2 id="learning-rust-like-a-martial-art">Learning Rust like a martial art</h2><p>I worked through chapters 4–7 of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">the Rust book</a>. I’m impressed with the language design, but I’m still more impressed with the structure and execution of the book itself.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-03-slices.html">chapter 4 comes full circle at the end</a> and it becomes clear why string literals are just string slices — references to starting addresses in memory — excepted for locations in the binary at compile time, instead of on the heap at runtime. Beautiful!</p><p>After many recommendations, I installed Rustlings and drilled 43 exercises throughout the week. The first 25 or so were very easy, but good <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/rc-weeknotes-02/#you-gotta-do-the-reps">reps</a>. Then it started getting a little meatier.</p><p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/2hXNd6x9sZs?t=299">idea</a> is treat these straightforward exercises like martial artists treat their <em>Katas</em> — honing the “muscle memory” of foundational patterns through practice and repetition. It’s a fun and rewarding supplement to the more abstract theory of the main book and I’m thoroughly enjoying learning a new language this way.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.nongnu.org/lwip/2_1_x/images/rustlings-01-nvim.png" alt="Rustlings screenshot"/></p><h2 id="doing-the-impossible">Doing the impossible</h2><p>The RC faculty host “Impossible Stuff Day” periodically. It’s a whole day to spend on something that is well beyond the edge of your abilities and feels totally impossible.</p><p>This one didn’t really work for me. I usually bias towards having overly-ambitious and grandiose project ideas, so doubling down on that just sent me further into the same cognitive spirals as before.</p><p>Unlike most others in the batch, I didn’t have something concrete I planned to work on going into the day. I did some additional thinking and braindumping on paper, which was helpful reframing, but delayed me actually trying anything for a few hours.</p><p>I spent most of the time going deeper on <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/bottom-up-bio">my ideas about simulating entire cells in silico</a>. I looked into GPU.js, Libsoda, LatticeMicrobes, and read some papers. No meaningful headway.</p><p>I see the intuition behind the reframing of “impossible stuff day,” but upscaling ambition doesn’t seem to be the nudge I need lately. On the contrary, the explicitly-limited and borderline-ridiculous format of Creative Coding’s setup has been much more fun and productive for me.</p><h2 id="you-too-i-cant-live-with-or-without-you">You Too? I can’t live with or without you</h2><p>Creative Coding. This is one of my highlights each Wednesday and really seems to get me into writing code instead of overthinking.</p><p>This week’s prompt was the first few lines from “With or Without You” by U2. As usual, I had great fun ideating with the group and then blasted some U2 bangers while going through various game ideas.</p><pre><code>See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I&#39;ll wait for you

Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I&#39;ll wait without you

With or without you
With or without you
</code></pre><p>Guided by the “thorn” and “bed of nails” references, I finally settled on <a href="https://with-or-without-you.vercel.app/">With or without you</a>, where a hedgehog and a balloon explore their complex push-pull relationship with the help of “sleight of hand” from the player and “twist of fate” from the RNG. I whipped this up in just over an hour with <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> (using GPT-4-turbo to get quick answers about details buried in the docs).</p><p>See if you can beat my high score of 46. The experience is best on mobile. Code is at <a href="https://github.com/gianlucatruda/with-or-without-you-game">github.com/gianlucatruda/with-or-without-you-game</a>.</p><p>UPDATE: I initially tried embedding the game here, but my iFrame trick doesn’t seem to play nicely with the control inputs and screen resizing, so you’re better off playing the game at <a href="https://with-or-without-you.vercel.app/">with-or-without-you.vercel.app</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.nongnu.org/lwip/2_1_x/images/wowy-game-demo.gif" alt="GIF of With or without you game, hedgehog jumping"/></p><h3 id="build-games-people-love">Build games people love</h3><p>(I’m working on an entire standalone post on this)</p><p>Several people at RC were still posting highscores and comments about the game multiple days after I shared it. And I received the ultimate endorsement in the world of game dev:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.nongnu.org/lwip/2_1_x/images/highest-game-compliment.png" alt="His 7-year-old loves my game"/></p><p>After <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/rc-weeknotes-02/#pointy-birds">week two’s 3D swarm simulator</a> and now this reception, I’m updating massively in favour of interactive experiences that afford fun and easy sharing. It’s both a more rewarding feedback loop for me and more engaging output for everyone else.</p><h2 id="algorithms-to-live-by-return-to-anki">Algorithms to Live By: Return to Anki</h2><p>I finally got back into doing <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> again — both my technical cards and my language ones.</p><p>It started with some improvements. I enabled the more efficient <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki">FSRS algorithm</a> that Oliver recommended to me, updated some parameters, customised the retention rates per deck, and then got seriously stuck in!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.nongnu.org/lwip/2_1_x/images/anki-fsrs-settings.png" alt="Anki algorithm settings menu"/></p><p>What I need next is a better workflow (and discipline) for creating new Anki cards. I’m hoping that I can configure a good pipeline with Obsidian and that learning Rust during RC is the right catalyst for getting around to that.</p><hr/><p>I’m experimenting with format, content, and style in these <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/tags/weeknotes">weeknotes</a>. If you’ve read this whole thing, I’d love to hear from you, even if it’s just “That was &lt;good | bad | meh&gt;.” Please do reach out.</p></div></div>
