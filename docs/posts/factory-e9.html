                    <p>Of course, if it were really a GIGAfactory, it would be approximately the size of the continental united states. In point of fact, it&#39;s just a factory. But then, that is the hilarity and absurdity of an enterprise that has mostly won or lost on marketing. </p><p>And then suddenly, we&#39;re on a highway overpass. It&#39;s the A10 – part of the autobahn ring system surrounding Berlin. We something gray and low slung a few clicks down the highway.</p><p>We continue on our path, back into the woods, and we begin to see signs of industry. High-voltage, three-phase power cables, snaking along the ground of the forest, surrounded by chainlink. Every 100 meters or so there is an surveillance tower and signage which implies that we&#39;re somehow transgressors, but clearly lacks a legal tooth.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://0x539.lol/content/images/2022/07/DSCF0530-2.jpg" width="2000" height="1333" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://0x539.lol/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/DSCF0530-2.jpg 600w, https://0x539.lol/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/DSCF0530-2.jpg 1000w, https://0x539.lol/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/DSCF0530-2.jpg 1600w, https://0x539.lol/content/images/size/w2400/2022/07/DSCF0530-2.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/></p></div></div></figure><p>Finally, we roll into the parking lot. This is an american parking lot, even if it&#39;s in germany. It&#39;s 31c, but in the endless ocean of concrete, it feels five years in the future – baking, choking on ozone, nowhere to hide from the UV. Such a place can only be described as hostile to human life. The signage agrees: &#34;Danger Zone for Pedestrians!&#34;</p><p>Any direction that you look, there is rubble and refuse and waste: old tupperware, underground storage tanks with some defect, the plastic wrap from a palette of pre-poured concrete.</p><figure><img src="https://0x539.lol/content/images/2022/07/giga4-3.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="307" srcset="https://0x539.lol/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/giga4-3.jpg 600w, https://0x539.lol/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/giga4-3.jpg 1000w, https://0x539.lol/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/giga4-3.jpg 1600w, https://0x539.lol/content/images/size/w2400/2022/07/giga4-3.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/></figure><p>The low-slung grey something is a low-slung gray something, even from up close. The art on the sides is some derivative of a derivative of an ayn rand book cover, but like... piped through pytorch.</p>
