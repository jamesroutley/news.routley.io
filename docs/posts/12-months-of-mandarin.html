    <h1>12 Months of Mandarin</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Estimates for achieving intermediate fluency in Mandarin Chinese range up to spending years and around 4000 total hours (2,200h classroom hours, 1,800 outside). I did it in 1500 hours total and less than a year.</p>


<p>Over the last 365 days, I studied Mandarin for fun. With anki, tutors, and traveling accelerating my learning, I ended up getting to the level of comfortable conversational fluency. My Mandarin isn&#39;t perfect nor perfectly fluent, but I can now handle everything up to technical conversations in the area of my PhD.¬†</p><p>For serious language learners, I also jotted down a longer list of methodds: <a href="https://isaak.net/mandarinmethods/">isaak.net/mandarinmethods</a></p><h2 id="humble-beginnings-%E2%80%94-%E7%AD%9A%E8%B7%AF%E8%93%9D%E7%BC%95">Humble Beginnings ‚Äî Á≠öË∑ØËìùÁºï</h2><p><strong>Month 1:</strong> Last September, I was deep into my math undergrad. It was pretty dry. I was looking for some fun non-math side project. I flirted with French, Russian, archery, parkour, and Japanese. But those didn‚Äôt ignite my passion. I happened to watch a snippet of the anime Demon Slayer in an obscure <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VoT0TY0emM&amp;ref=isaak.net">Chinese fan dub</a>. Ironically, this caught my attention. I also had lots of Chinese friends, so why not learn a little Mandarin? Oh my, I had no idea how obsessed I&#39;d end up with this &#34;little&#34; side project.</p>
<p>Berkeley had a breakneck-speed Mandarin beginner class. I loved it. Within a week, we learned pinyin. We learned the tones. We learned to read. We learned to write. Then started talking immediately, every single day. Talking in horribly horribly broken Chinese, but nevertheless having conversations. I learned the very most important survival vocabulary, like: <em>I am Isaak</em> and <em>Yes, I live in America</em> and <em>Sorry, no, I‚Äôm not a basketball player for the Golden State Warriors</em>.</p>

But come chat anyway! (Qingyuan, China)</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>The beginning was by far the hardest time, and many tuned out or dropped out. But I had lots of fun. I played a lot. I wrote a horrible poem about humanity colonizing Mars. My Chinese was absolute crap, but I was improving <em>fast</em>. Chinese is my fifth language, and I had a few tricks up my sleeve:</p><h2 id="intense-self-study-%E2%80%94-%E8%87%AA%E5%BC%BA%E4%B8%8D%E6%81%AF">Intense Self-Study ‚Äî Ëá™Âº∫‰∏çÊÅØ</h2><p><strong>Month 3: </strong>Spaced repetition is a superweapon. The spaced repetition app Anki is the core reason why I was able to study Chinese efficiently. Alongside Anki, I adopted other methods to learn <em>faster</em>. </p><p>Frequency-based learning. Comprehensible input. Reading lots as soon as I could, especially graded readers. Buying a calligraphy pen-brush and learned how to write the 600 Chinese characters. FSRS. Creating a 100,000-card Anki megadeck. For all the nitty-gritty language learning tips, check out <a href="https://isaak.net/mandarinmethods/" rel="noreferrer">my methods post</a>. </p><p>Early on, I started watching anime dubs like Boruto or Scissor Seven. I really enjoyed myself despite barely understanding anything. Every few minutes I collected a new word to study. The content I watched in those early days felt like colorful images with funny sounds which occasionally made sense.¬†</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdkzR7VAlJdrPr9X0XuxXJFcdOB9gnxfeRHyrtUpagDZ2krk5NsaA9653_HhAGhzu1L4LmF-vgN9e_rkNWXRd6CRNZex7DUk9SFfjqcITATrrGw8Nx_BcWKjrvXo06bFKYRAtk6bLBYaLLsZ_bK-LIu2ezL?key=va-1OSyREuqkqYOZib3JNw" alt="" loading="lazy" width="379" height="213"/><figcaption><i><em>Colorful images with funny sounds which occasionally make sense</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>On day 70 I reached a vocabulary of 1050, of which 460 characters.</p>


<p>The other superweapon I implemented was personalized tutoring. My first month studying Chinese was mostly in a 20-people class. But then, I took Bloom&#39;s Two-Sigma effect to heart and got myself lots of 1-1 tutoring. The more time I spent on tutoring, the more it accelerated my studies.</p>


<p>There‚Äôs legends like <a href="https://www.chinese-forums.com/forums/topic/43939-independent-chinese-study-review/?ref=isaak.net"><u>Tamu</u></a> spending dozens of hours with tutors, but I‚Äôd mostly spend up to six hours a week. More would start to detract from my main focus, which were still my math studies. My default for working with tutors was to lead a &#34;normal&#34; conversation. I had two strict rules for conversations with tutors: 1. Only Chinese, no English. 2. Correct every single mistake I make. </p><figure><img src="https://isaak.net/content/images/2024/10/IMG_3800.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2042" srcset="https://isaak.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_3800.jpeg 600w, https://isaak.net/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_3800.jpeg 1000w, https://isaak.net/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_3800.jpeg 1600w, https://isaak.net/content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_3800.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><i><em>I definitely lost all my social anxiety after 3 days of walking around tourist-packed Hawaii beaches loudly talking broken Chinese</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>At the start, this tutoring was excruciatingly slow. But it was very worth it. After the chat, I‚Äôd ask them to send me a summary of my key mistakes and newly learned vocabulary. It‚Äôd add that to my Anki.¬†</p><p>I made lots of mistakes. I still do. Tutoring gives me a tight and fast feedback loop on fixing my mistakes.</p><h2 id="traveling-%E2%80%94-%E5%AD%A6%E4%BB%A5%E8%87%B4%E7%94%A8">Traveling ‚Äî Â≠¶‰ª•Ëá¥Áî®</h2><p><strong>Month 4:</strong> Winter break was approaching. I knew all the Chinese I needed to know to travel. (<em>No, sorry, I‚Äôm not LeBron James.</em>) I figured out tourist visas, and just went for it. After Christmas in chafing-lips-freezing-cold Austria, I found myself wandering around fogged-up-glasses-humid Taipei.</p>

I‚Äôd walk around with airpods in, sugar-shocked from eating too many sugar gourds, explaining to my tutor in great detail what tasty novel things I ate at the night market. When not on a tutoring call, I‚Äôd sit in cafes and study, wander around markets, or talk to locals. </p><p>Being a foreigner with passable Mandarin is... amusing. When meditating in a small Buddhist temple town in middle-of-nowhere rural Sichuan, I was a local celebrity. 300 primary schooler filed past me, who definitely hadn&#39;t seen an Austrian-African foreigner speaking Mandarin. They totally lost it. It was fun, but also tiring. Eventually I preferred to be in the cities, where being a foreigner wasn‚Äôt a miracle.¬†</p><p>At least, I got a good taste of why being famous must be great for exactly three minutes, and then quite frankly horrible forever after. Not again. I‚Äôm okay, thanks.</p><p>In total, I was in Mainland China three times this year, for a total of two months. It goes without saying that every journey gave me an enormous boost in my learning pace. The first time travelling got me from <em>broken</em> to <em>comfortable in all day-to-day situations</em>. Every time I travelled I learned roughly 1000 new words/characters. Every time immensely boosted my fluent expression and listening ability.</p>

Apart from the study sprints while traveling, I tried to keep up a consistently high pace back at home. Chinese wasn‚Äôt my focus then ‚Äî math and neuro were. Chinese was consistently the largest side project, clocking some 15 hours a week.</p><p>Consistency was the most important part to keep a high pace of progress.

        </figure><p>Some 7 months from start, I reached 5,000 known words/characters. The old highest level (HSK6) also required a vocabulary of 5,000 (different) words. So this was an epic goal to hit.</p>


<p>Immersion is best done while traveling. Still, I started to immerse myself as well as I could at home. My devices would be in Chinese. I started taking some notes primarily in Mandarin. I had lots of social support throughout too: I was lucky to be able to build new relationships entirely in Chinese. For example, my grad school supervisor, a Tsinghua graduate now at MIT, was more than happy to teach me neuroscience in Chinese. I had tutors. I turned older relationships fully Chinese. This had me constantly speaking Mandarin day-to-day.</p><p><strong>Month 12: </strong>Exactly 365 days after I started, I reached a vocabulary of 8000 words and characters.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdSe8Wt-7sEziRiPjp_mO0JZ6rHEK_kdZkBDlxJZ0e-7HBiN__o1wAXc8Fsdb8_Nu20BQTQWKO841-ADHl7o7VO1RB9XEtcyuQiQXyCRD5N4jYXjDtM76t_rpyLBg7dro0U04raEzKooGKAiPfYzuND38_U?key=va-1OSyREuqkqYOZib3JNw" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="63"/></figure><p>8000 words and characters makes most content I encounter relatively understandable. My vocabulary is a weird personal mix: Basics including everything up to HSK5, anime vocabulary, biology, mathematics, and random everyday stuff from travelling.</p><p>Vocabulary is only one part of fluency. It&#39;s important to keep eyes on the goal: The goal of any language is to communicate effectively. Prompted for feedback on my progress, my usually reserved tutor recently commented: ‚ÄúThis was the fastest learning pace from zero to advanced conversational fluency I have ever seen.&#34; </p><p>That&#39;s kind, but being<em> fluent </em>feels like it‚Äôll always be an overstatement. Especially for Chinese. I‚Äôm definitely not <em>Fluent‚Ñ¢</em>. I sometimes still get my tones wrong. Full-speed native speech is sometimes still tough. Local dialects remain a complete mystery to me.</p><p>I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm <em>comfortable </em>with Chinese. I can <em>comfortably</em> travel in any Mandarin-speaking place. I can <em>comfortably </em>hold long conversations. I can <em>comfortably </em>watch most content. I can <em>comfortably </em>build relationships entirely in Mandarin.¬†</p><p>The goal? I want to reach a level where the legendary Three-Body Problem will be <em>comfortably </em>readable.</p><hr/><p>Curious about more?
