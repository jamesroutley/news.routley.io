    <h1>Steam Deck reports are here</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the lucky of you already gaming on your Steam Deck and adventurous enough to plug a keyboard in with a switch to Desktop mode, you&#39;ve already authored some reports on ProtonDB. And that&#39;s excellent.</p>
<p>How about we make things easier?</p>
<p>I&#39;m happy to announce that we&#39;re officially ready for formal Steam Deck reports at ProtonDB! I&#39;m a little embarassed to share that Valve has graciously provided me with a dev unit to prepare the site for this release. I&#39;ll have to save my extended thoughts on it for another day, but for now I&#39;ll sum up: yes, this is game changing. It&#39;s a PC in a portable format and a joy to explore.</p>
<p>It does however present some unique challenges for traditional web development:</p>
<p><img alt="web-on-deck" src="https://www.protondb.com/content/news/images/webondeck.jpg"/></p>
<p>Wait. Ignore that picture, not ready yet.</p>
<p>So back to the main quest: here&#39;s the headliners for this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your preferences and devices are now persisted across anywhere you log in.</li>
<li>Along with PC devices, you can now add Steam Deck devices</li>
<li>You&#39;ll need to be on Steam Deck desktop mode to add it as a device, but thanks to user persistence you only need to do this once and can then write from your PC or wherever you prefer.</li>
<li>You can now write reports as either PC or Steam Deck reports, either on a PC or Steam Deck, from your pool of devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Valve&#39;s Deck Verified program, having just crossed 1,000 of verified + playable status, has given us an excellent foundation for officially-sanctioned Linux gaming, but there&#39;s still an important role for community reports.</p>
<p>It&#39;s to expand the list of what we know we can play. It&#39;s to keep the searchlight on games that are not yet supported, or ones that are officially supported but shipped a broken update. Tips and tinkerings to help each other out.</p>
<p>Steam Deck gaming not only benefits from general Linux compatibility advice, but has a set of other unique considerations to juggle as well. Two that come to mind are controller configuration and battery life. So I&#39;ve added a step in the report flow for these and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more we can add.</p>
<p><img alt="steam-deck-related" src="https://www.protondb.com/content/news/images/deckrelated.png"/></p>
<p>And here&#39;s what a report currently looks like from a Steam Deck device (this will certainly be iterated on):</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for now. All that&#39;s left is to make a shout: March forth your gaming, and remember to bring on your Steam Deck reports!</p>
<p>OK, one more shout: getting the site up to shape for this release has been a giant effort. Want to see more goody goodness? Consider joining as a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/protondb">Patreon</a> supporter. Thank you very much to those of you who have!</p>
<p>Epilogue: the rest of the changelist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device: Save button for name moved next to input.</li>
<li>Device: Icon for invalid system info.</li>
<li>Device: Tooltip on system info validity icon.</li>
<li>Device: Regression fix: Invalid system info accurately detected again.</li>
<li>Profile: Library information now moved to the right side of Preferences.</li>
<li>Tooltips: No longer present a pointing cursor as if they are a link.</li>
<li>Contribute: Will no longer ignore Next on &#39;Setup&#39; step when you have exactly two devices. <em>le sigh</em></li>
<li>Contribute: GE version validator updated to accept <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-1">new naming pattern</a> (thanks @Zato for identifying).</li>
<li>Mobile style fix: Padding removed that caused page to scroll unnecessarily horizontally.</li>
<li>Mobile bug fix: Routing: Scrolls to top on internal links.</li>
<li>Mobile bug fix: Reports: Reports authored before the latest variant flow now show appropriate playtime instead of NaN.</li>
</ul>
