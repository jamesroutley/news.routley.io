    <p>The function <strong><em>G</em></strong> is defined as follows:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nil">G : ℕ × ℕ → ℕ

G(n, 0) = n

G(n, 1) = G(1, n + 3)

G(4k + 0, m) = G(7k +  7, m - 2)
G(4k + 1, m) = G(7k +  8, m - 1)
G(4k + 2, m) = G(7k +  8, m - 1)
G(4k + 3, m) = G(7k + 14, m - 2)</code></pre></figure>

<p>🛃 <strong>Question</strong> 🛃 Does <em>G(1, 1)</em> terminate?</p>

<p>🛄 <strong>Answer</strong> 🛄 Yes. <em>G(1, 1) = 2533…2210 &gt; 18<sup>7003</sup></em>.</p>

<p>That was just a warmup. <em>G</em> is not the function referred to in the title of this post. What we really want to know about is <strong><em>H</em></strong>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nil">H : ℕ × ℕ → ℕ

H(n, 0) = n

H(n, 1) = H(1, n + 3)

H(4k + 0, m) = H(7k + 14, m - 2)
H(4k + 1, m) = H(7k +  8, m - 1)
H(4k + 2, m) = H(7k + 15, m - 1)
H(4k + 3, m) = H(7k + 14, m - 2)</code></pre></figure>

<p>🛃 <strong>Question</strong> 🛃 Does <em>H(1, 1)</em> terminate?</p>

<p>🛄 <strong>Answer</strong> 🛄 <strong>… ¿ 🛐 ? …</strong></p>

<p><em>G(1, 1)</em> returns its answer after <strong>28,833 iterations</strong>. <em>H(1, 1)</em> does not return an answer after any <strong>reasonable number</strong> of iterations. There are two possibilities:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>H(1, 1)</em> <strong>never</strong> returns an answer.</li>
  <li><em>H(1, 1)</em> returns an answer after an <strong>unreasonable number</strong> of iterations.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Practically speaking</strong>, there is no difference – we get no answer either way.</p>

<p>🛃 <strong>Question</strong> 🛃 Which possibility is more likely?</p>

<p><em>G</em> and <em>H</em> are examples of <strong>iterated Collatz-like functions</strong>. The first argument accumulates the answer and the second argument counts how many times to apply the transformation. The countdown argument can get reset, giving these functions an <strong>Ackermann</strong> flavor.</p>

<p>Notice that we are <em>not</em> asking about whether <em>H</em> is <strong><a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2022/04/01/total-partial-functions.html">total</a></strong>, and neither are we claiming that <em>G</em> is. Those would be <strong><em>very difficult claims to prove</em></strong>. No, we are asking the <em>severely unambitiious</em> question of whether these functions terminate on <strong><em>just this one particular argument</em></strong>. <em>G(1, 1)</em> terminates, but we can’t answer for <em>H(1, 1)</em>.</p>

<p>One way to look at this is to say: <em>G</em> and <em>H</em> have quite similar definitions – they differ at just two parameters. <strong><em>G(1, 1)</em> terminates, so why shouldn’t <em>H(1, 1)</em>?</strong> Maybe most functions similar to <em>G</em> terminate, and so we should assume that <em>H</em> does too.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <strong>why exactly <em>does</em> <em>G(1, 1)</em> terminate?</strong> There’s no obvious reason why it should work. In fact, it seems <strong>miraculous</strong> that it terminates at all. Maybe most of these functions <em>don’t</em> terminate, and <em>G</em> is a remarkable exception.</p>

<p>🛃 <strong>Question</strong> 🛃 Why are we talking about these weird functions?</p>

<p>🛄 <strong>Answer</strong> 🛄 In connection with the <strong><a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2022/02/11/latest-beeping-busy-beaver-results.html">Beeping Busy Beaver</a></strong> problem, <strong>Turing machine programs</strong> have been discovered that implement these functions. The program that implements <em>G</em> is the current 5-state 2-color BBB champion, and the program that implements <em>H</em> is a contender. Both programs are “children” of the so-called <strong><a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2022/04/03/mother-of-giants.html">Mother of Giants</a></strong> and were discovered by <strong><a href="https://github.com/sligocki/busy-beaver/">Shawn Ligocki</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Proving the true value of <em>BBB(5)</em> is at least as hard as determining the outcome of <em>H(1, 1)</em>.</strong></p>
