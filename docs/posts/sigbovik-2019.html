      <p>I always imagined my first published paper would be the work of many hours of hard Computer Science research, winding into the wee hours of the night, compiled into a piece of writing of stellar quality. Of course life got in the way, and instead my first published paper is in <a href="http://sigbovik.org/2019/proceedings.pdf">the proceedings</a> of <a href="https://sigbovik.org">SIGBOVIK 2019</a>, The Association for Computational Heresy. It’s four pages long and is titled “Eventually Consistent Partying”. It applies distributed systems research to drinking alcohol at parties. As per usual, you can find it on <a href="http://github.com/hellerve/eventually-consistent-partying">my Github</a>.</p>
<p>All things considered, I think life turned out to be better than my imagination.</p>
