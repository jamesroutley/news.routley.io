<!-- END WAYBACK TOOLBAR INSERT -->
 




<!-- Note:  Since originally publishing this commentary, I have received a fair amount of criticism for the viewpoint expressed.  Rebuttals inevitably involve at least one of the following excuses: -->


<!-- Since Windows 95 is <i>x</i> years old, you shouldn't use it. -->
<!-- Since Windows 95 is used by only <i>x</i>% of people, you shouldn't use it. -->


<!-- Both of these reasons are ridiculous.  Logic suggests that a tool from 1996 is every bit as good today as it was in 1996.  Meanwhile, it's common knowledge that "everyone else is doing it" is alone never a good reason to do anything.  In any case, my opinion remains unchanged.  If you haven't been offended yet, read on. -->

<p>(After you&#39;ve partaken of my wisdom, but sure to check out my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080220175358/http://www.andrew-turnbull.net/journal.html">blog</a>, such that it is.)

</p>

<p>The operating system I currently use on my primary computer is Windows 95 OSR2.  Furthermore, not only do I use Windows 95 extensively, but I <i>prefer</i> it to Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP, and Vista.</p>

<p>Yes, I am aware that this puts me in a position not shared by many other people today.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the proportion of people still using Windows 95 on a regular basis is ½% or less.  And, I am accustomed to getting strange or uncomplementary reactions from other people when they find out that I still do:  &#34;Are you insane?&#34; or
&#34;Why the hell are you using Windows 95?!&#34; are only typical.  I can no longer count on most of the latest software being capable of running on this configuration.  So, why do I still endorse a computer operating system more than ten years old?</p>

<p>First of all, a computer is a tool.  It is a principal of mine that if a tool works well and satisfies my wants and needs, there is no reason to replace it; regardless of mere age.  On that note, I have traditionally been the last using any given piece of computer software on occasions before:  I used Windows 3.1x semi-regularly on my Gateway 2000 486 as late as mid-2003, when I had a practical need to turn to a newer computer for regular tasks and be capable of running 32-bit programs.  Windows 95 is far more technologically sophisticated and viable than Windows 3.1x.</p>

<p>Second of all, for a variety of reasons I have a major aversion to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080220175358/http://www.andrew-turnbull.net/journal0709.html#250">Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0</a> and higher:  I do not want to use it and I do <i>not</i> want it present in any form on any computer I own.  With Windows 98, Microsoft needlessly integrated Internet Explorer 4.01 (or later 5.0) into features that were ostensibly parts of the operating system itself:  The Explorer shell interface and Windows Help both display their contents in Internet Explorer windows complete with a browser-like throbber in the corner, with the browser difficult if not impossible to completely remove.  This dubious practice has continued into all subsequent versions of Windows to date.  By contrast, it is not difficult to completely remove or circumvent the preinstallation of Internet Explorer from Windows 95 OSR2, and the earliest versions (though less stable and less capable than OSR2) didn&#39;t include IE at all.</p>

<p>Windows 95 is reasonably fast in performance, and is not compromised by the arguably frivolous animation and eye candy features in Windows 98 and newer versions:  Sliding or fading menus, gradient title bars, &#34;flat&#34; toolbars, and menus that annoyingly take on the 3D appearance of command buttons when moving the mouse over or selecting them but to name a few examples.  There are no &#34;activation&#34; schemes, and the OS installed takes up well under 500MB.</p>

<p>Currently there is no hardware or software I need or desire to use that is not capable of running on Windows 95.  I can run even Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird in a pinch.  Most of the applications I have found that <i>do</i> require Windows 98 or higher, meanwhile, tend to be incidentally plagued by having slow performance, a poor interface design (such as with the newest versions of Windows Media Player and RealPlayer), and/or no compelling functionality not present in an earlier version.  In any case, the APIs of Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 98 are virtually identical, and there is <b>no good reason</b> for any software capable of running on one not to work on the other as well.  With my browser and e-mail client, Office 97, WordPerfect 7, and a few graphic tools I can be as productive as I like with Windows 95.</p>

<p>While I freely concede that Windows NT 4.0, 2000, and XP are much more stable than Windows 95, I also maintain that Windows 95 OSR2 is the most stable DOS-based version of Windows to be released, moreso than Windows 98 and <i>especially</i> the buggy mess that was Windows ME.  It is substantially more stable and handles system resources more efficiently than Windows 3.1x as well.</p>

<p>I prefer to have as much native compatibility as possible with DOS applications such as older games I own.  While it is possible to run these from Windows 2000 or XP either natively or (as circumstances may very well require) through an emulator, I prefer to have the real thing.</p>

<p>Finally, Windows 95 has an intuitive user interface I prefer to the IE-integrated monstrosities of Windows 98 and subsequent versions.  Windows 95&#39;s Explorer uses OS-native controls and menus, has all the most essential tools—such as file-delete and individual icon-view controls—on the toolbar, does not waste space with oversized toolbar controls or needless left-hand icon-and-caption panels, <i>and</i> doesn&#39;t contain unnecessary Internet Explorer tie-ins such as awkward &#34;back&#34; and &#34;forward&#34; file navigation or a &#34;Favorites&#34; menu.  The Start menu automatically sorts folders and files alphabetically automatically, and defaults to a multi-column view instead of Windows 98&#39;s slow and inconvenient scroll arrows.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect my reasoning to be representative for everyone, of course, and I have sometimes been tempted to switch to a different version of Windows myself (specifically NT 4.0 or 2000) or even abandon Windows entirely a number of times.  However, I have justifiable reasons for my decisions, and will continue using Windows 95 OSR2 as my primary OS for the forseeable future until I can no longer run a relatively up-to-date web browser or absolutely must use a piece of hardware or software not compatible with Windows 95.</p>
