<p>Sorry if I upset any of the nice Racket folks out there.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs time for a little reality check.  First, repeat after me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coding is a tool to get stuff done.  If you let your programming language
impact your productivity, you are not in charge, the technology is calling the
shots.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-would-i-use-racket-today"><a href="#why-would-i-use-racket-today">¬ß</a><span>Why would I use Racket today?</span></h2>
<p>Do I want to iterate every 18 hours waiting for the pkgs.racket-lang.org build
server to finish building my package?  Then do it again because the build
failed (my mistake, but now my users have to wait until later that week‚Ä¶)?</p>
<p>Do I want to worry about packaging and deploying Racket code or could I simply
do the same in most other languages without any fuss?  I tried packaging Racket
in Nix, it did not go well.</p>
<p>Do I want to invest trust in a programming platform that considers umask of
<a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/4511">optional importance</a>?</p>
<p>Do I want to force users to adopt an application written in a language that
uses at the very <em>least</em> <code>122M</code> resident memory on my workstation?  Or do I
consider Python or Guile which both use less than <code>10M</code>?</p>
<p>Do I want to force users to package Racket which itself has no clear custody of
its build inputs - can you produce a Racket tarball yourself that is exactly
like the one on the release site?  Who knows what‚Äôs in those tarballs!</p>
<p>Do I want to invest in a community without a mechanism to apply community
feedback constructively?  RFCs?</p>
<p>Do I want to write 4x the code (in Racket) because I forgot my secret move was
actually all the pypi packages that I took for granted in Python?</p>
<p>Do I want to wonder about what was meant by ‚Äúcontributions welcome‚Äù when most
of the core racket codebases at best have a README, at worst have no
contributor documentation?</p>
<p>Do I want to invest in a platform where leadership is building <a href="https://github.com/racket/rhombus-prototype">Rombus</a>
a.k.a. Racket2 instead of focusing on making core Racket just that much better
and easier to adopt?
(see also: <a href="https://greghendershott.com/2019/07/future-of-racket.html">Future of Racket</a>.)</p>
<p>Do I want to wait 10+ minutes for my package to build in CI because some other
package maintainer decided to pull in <code>racket</code> or <code>racket-doc</code> (which pulls in
the entire big Racket distribution)?</p>
<p>Do I want to ship multi-gigabyte docker images because of the above kitchen sink package?</p>
<p>Do I want to deal with being blocked due to not understanding how to use the
less understood features of racket such as continuations,
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/Parsing_Syntax.html#%28form._%28%28lib._syntax%2Fparse..rkt%29._syntax-parse%29%29">syntax-parse</a>/<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/stx-patterns.html#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fstxcase-scheme..rkt%29._syntax-case%29%29">syntax-case</a> macros, <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/Signatures_and_Units.html">units/signatures</a>?  <em>You‚Äôll want to know about</em>
<em>all these things to write effective Racket code.</em></p>
<p>Do I want to add business risk by writing a product in Racket?  Does anybody
work as an industry Racket coder at all?  Would I struggle to hire more talent?</p>
<p>Do I‚Ä¶. yeah there‚Äôs more but let‚Äôs move on ;)</p>
<h2 id="no-i-don-t-want-to-invest-more-time-in-racket"><a href="#no-i-don-t-want-to-invest-more-time-in-racket">¬ß</a><span>No I don‚Äôt want to invest more time in Racket</span></h2>
<p>This post took forever to write.  I‚Äôm giving up a portion of myself (and
allowing for more growth) by giving up Racket.  My initial premise was that
Racket could replace Python in my workflows.  For a time that seemed to work.</p>
<p>But then the real hard truths started to appear.  I was losing a lot of
productivity.  The productivity losses were incremental but certainly slowed
down my velocity significantly over the last seven years.  Sure the language
has a lot of wonderful features, but there‚Äôs more to a good programming
language than well, its programming language.</p>
<p>I also believed I could make a career out of using or supporting software
related to or written in Racket.  I think this was a bit too ambitious from my
perspective.  Where did the racket-money mailing list go?  Or really all the
production users?  I only found <strong><strong>one production user</strong></strong>.</p>
<p>So long and thanks for all the standard fish.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm giving away the <code>racket.wiki</code> domain.  If you want it and have a Gandi account,
I‚Äôll transfer it to you.  <a href="https://winny.tech/">Contact info on my home page</a>.  Racket leaders, please
consider taking this domain so I don‚Äôt end up giving it to a complete rando.</p>
