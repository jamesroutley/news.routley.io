Back at the beginning of 2020, it was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/808260/">predicted</a> that retirements would increase
during this decade.  In 2021, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/840632/">the prediction</a>
was that retirements would increase over the next couple of years. It is
happening and LWN is no exception.  I am retiring at the end of this year
after more than 20 years with LWN.
</p><p>
So who am I and how did I get here?  To some, I&#39;m a name at the bottom of
some LWN page. To a few, I&#39;m the one that reminds them when their LWN group
subscription is about to expire. You might have even met me at a
conference. Not that I have been to very many.  Mostly I tend to be quietly
in the background watching the LWN mailbox, looking for brief items and
quotes of the week (sorry I haven&#39;t found much lately), proofreading
articles, managing subscriptions, and more. But I&#39;m older than most of you
and this is my last LWN weekly edition.  Getting here is a bit of story.
</p><p>
I got my first paying job in 1968 when I was in my late teens.  It had
nothing to do with computers.  It was 10 years later when I decided to
study computers and programming.  After graduating from high school I had
various, low-paying odd jobs, until finally I was ready for more education.
I started going to <a href="https://coloradomtn.edu/campuses/spring-valley/">Colorado Mountain
College</a>, located near Glenwood Springs, in the mid-1970s. I took a lot
of math and physics classes, skied in the winter, and rafted the Colorado
River in the summer.  Just before I graduated in 1978, I had a class where
one assignment was to write a program in BASIC.  I forget what kind of
computer it was; an early type of PC that belonged to one of the
professors.  It was my first encounter with programming a computer and I
wanted to learn more; something that could lead to a real career.
</p><p>
I decided to take a year off and then go to the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado</a> (CU) and
study computers.   If I had any doubts about that decision, they were
quenched after spending the winter shoveling snow in the little ski resort
town of Snowmass Village.  One week the high temperature was -20Â F.
Another week it snowed so much that all I did was shovel the same staircase
over and over and couldn&#39;t keep up.  Cold and snow was replaced by spring
cleanup, when the snow melts away and reveals lots of trash and lost items;
the $100 bill was a nice find, but mostly it&#39;s picking up trash.  Then the
boss offered me a job as a manager and in the conversation that followed he
told me &#34;no woman in the world is worth $5/hour, ever&#34;.  While the two
summers spent working for the Snowmass Village golf course were more
pleasant and I did get a raise to $5/hour before I left, I wanted a better
paying office job for the future.
</p><p>
Thus, in fall 1979, I moved to Boulder and started at CU, where I met
Jon Corbet in our first computer class.  We used punch cards and programmed
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)">Pascal</a>
on the school&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Data_Corporation">CDC 
mainframe</a>. A couple of years later, we met Liz Coolbaugh, LWN&#39;s other
founder, in an assembly-language programming class, using the mainframe.
By this time, Jon had a printer terminal and a modem, so we did our
assignments with reams of printer paper. I also worked on a project
where I got access to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX">VAX 11/780</a> running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">Berkeley Unix</a> and
learned some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>. 
</p><p>
After graduation, it was the Fortran that got me my first computer job.
They had an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_2100#1000_series">HP 1000 Minicompter</a> and a lot of old Fortran code.  Over the
years that followed there were other jobs where I learned some C and worked
on Unix systems.  I was systems administrator for a variety of computers
with different operating systems, but these computers were not networked. 
As a sysadmin, I applied updates, or did fresh installs of some OS,
backups, not much else. As programmer, there was number crunching, of
course.  I also wrote things like text-based user interfaces which
interacted with databases that someone else wrote.  Nothing fancy and not
any kind of systems programming.
</p><p>
Around 1994, I got a job that came with an office and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun</a> Workstation
running SunOS with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_Window_Manager">Motif Window
Manager</a>, fully connected to the internet.  I thought that was the best
computer environment ever. I didn&#39;t have root and I didn&#39;t really miss it.
I liked the Unix environment and the internet access, but one job led to
another, and while it still came with a Sun running Solaris, eventually I
was maintaining Fortran code.  By the late 1990s I was tired of maintaining
Fortran code.
</p><p>
In the (northern hemisphere) spring of 1999, Liz offered me a part-time job
as her assistant at LWN.  Eklektix, LWN&#39;s parent company, was running Linux
System Administration classes and I attended one of the last of those classes.
They were hauling around workstations for the classes and I took one home
after the class, installed Red Hat Linux 5, and started working for
LWN. Within a year Eklektix was solely focused on LWN and I became a part
owner of Eklektix and a full-time employee; just in time for LWN to become
a wholly owned subsidiary of <a href="https://tucows.com/">Tucows</a>.
</p><p>
The company grew to several employees with Tucows paying salaries.  That
lasted a little over a year before Tucows decided they didn&#39;t want us after
all.  It was the dot-com boom and bust. It took some time for Eklektix to
become a private company once again and we were without funding.  We
thought that was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/5409/">the end</a>, but within a week
donations from our readers poured in. Until the credit card clearing house
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/6532/">decided that something fraudulent</a> was going
on and put a stop to that.  There were several lean months before we began
the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/10688/">transition to the subscription model</a>.
That worked and LWN is fully funded by subscribers now.
</p><p>
Different people have come and gone from LWN over the years.  Liz, Dennis
Tenney, Forrest Cook, and others worked for LWN at one time, but moved on
some years ago.  Jake Edge joined 14+ years ago and now he and Jon will be
the only ones left to run LWN.  I hear they will be hiring.
</p><p>
I have enjoyed working for LWN, learning about free-software development,
without actually developing any software myself.  I&#39;m in awe of the kernel
community and what it has accomplished.  Once it was news if some company
used Linux in some way.  Now it&#39;s commonplace.  Linux has taken over the
computing world. It&#39;s in supercomputers, Android phones, the cloud, embedded
devices; it is almost everywhere.  Thanks to you subscribers, LWN has been
there to cover it. Back in 2002, when subscribing to LWN first became
possible, I don&#39;t think we imagined that some of the largest tech companies
in the world would have LWN group subscriptions.
</p><p>
So what&#39;s next? That remains to be seen. Once I thought programming was my
career of the future, but that turned out to be LWN instead.  Now
retirement is unlikely to be quite what I imagine, but I&#39;m looking forward
to the change in pace.  I&#39;ll spend more time outdoors when the weather is
nice, choosing when to spend time outside based on the weather forecast
rather than LWN&#39;s publishing schedule.  We&#39;ll see about all those &#34;I&#39;ll do
this when I have more time&#34; projects. 
</p><p>
Thanks again to all LWN subscribers who helped make LWN the success that it
is and helped fund my retirement.  Stay safe, have a good holiday season,
and a prosperous New Year.<br clear="all"/></p>
