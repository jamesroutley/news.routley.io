                    <p>European Commissioner Thierry Breton says the Digital Markets Act is just a beginning, and Apple must open up its whole ecosystem to competitors.
</p><p>The EU&#39;s Digital Markets Act (DMA) <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/07/19/european-council-approves-digital-markets-act-rules">was created</a> to target Big Tech firms like Apple, and make a fairer business environment for all comers. The DMA became law in the EU in <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/11/01/europe-confirms-its-digital-markets-act-will-go-after-apples-app-store">November 2022</a>, and became applicable from May 2023, though it is still in the process of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/09/06/apples-imessage-gets-a-reprieve-from-eu-law">being implemented</a>.
</p><p>According to <em>Reuters</em>, Thierry Breton has now <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eus-breton-tells-apple-ceo-open-its-ecosystem-rivals-2023-09-26/">called on Apple</a> to open up its hardware and software ecosystem.
</p><p>&#34;The next job for Apple and other Big Tech, under the DMA is to open up its gates to competitors,&#34; he said. &#34;Be it the electronic wallet, browsers or app stores, consumers using an Apple <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone" title="iPhone" data-kpt="1">iPhone</a> should be able to benefit from competitive services by a range of providers.&#34;
</p><p>Breton said this after meeting with <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/tim-cook" title="Tim Cook" data-kpt="1">Tim Cook</a> in Brussels, where the Apple CEO is certain to have reiterated the company&#39;s arguments about security and privacy.
</p><p>&#34;EU regulation fosters innovation, without compromising on security and privacy,&#34; Breton told <em>Reuters</em>.
</p><p>Apple has not commented. Cook&#39;s trip to Brussels was not announced, and he hasn&#39;t referred to his meeting with the EU Commissioner. However, he <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1706609678522658865/photo/1">has tweeted</a> about meeting with Apple Store staff in the city.</p>
