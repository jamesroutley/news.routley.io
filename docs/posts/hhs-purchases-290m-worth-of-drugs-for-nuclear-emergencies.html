      <p>To save lives following radiological and nuclear emergencies,  the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is purchasing a supply of the drug  Nplate from Amgen USA Inc; Nplate is approved to treat blood cell injuries that  accompany acute radiation syndrome in adult and pediatric patients (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/emergencies/healthandsafety.htm" target="_blank">ARS</a>).</p><p>Amgen, based in Thousands Oaks, California, developed Nplate  for ARS with <a href="https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda/cbrn#portfolio">support</a> from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (<a href="https://aspr.hhs.gov:443/barda">BARDA</a>), part of the HHS Administration  for Strategic Preparedness and Response (<a href="https://aspr.hhs.gov:443/">ASPR</a>),  as well as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of  the National Institutes of Health. </p><p>BARDA is using  its authority provided under the 2004 <a href="https://aspr.hhs.gov:443/AboutASPR/ProgramOffices/BARDA/Pages/Project-Bioshield.aspx">Project Bioshield</a> Act and $290 million in Project BioShield  designated funding to purchase this supply of the drug. Amgen will maintain  this supply in vendor-managed inventory. This approach decreases life-cycle  management costs for taxpayers because doses that near expiration can be  rotated into the commercial market for rapid use prior to expiry and new doses  can be added to the government supply.</p><p>ARS, also known as radiation sickness, occurs when a  person’s entire body is exposed to a high dose of penetrating radiation,  reaching internal organs in a matter of seconds. Symptoms of ARS injuries  include impaired blood clotting as a result of low platelet counts, which can  lead to uncontrolled and life-threatening bleeding. </p><p>To reduce radiation-induced  bleeding, Nplate stimulates the body’s production of platelets. The drug can be used to treat adults and children. </p><p>Nplate is also  approved for adult and pediatric patients with <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/immune-thrombocytopenia/" target="_blank">immune thrombocytopenia</a>, a blood disorder resulting in low  platelet counts. Repurposing drugs for acute radiation syndrome that also are approved  for a commercial indication helps to sustain availability of the product and  improves healthcare provider familiarity with the drug. </p><p><strong>About HHS, ASPR,  and BARDA</strong>: HHS works to  enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans, providing for  effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine, public  health, and social services. <a href="https://aspr.hhs.gov:443/">ASPR</a> leads HHS in preparing the nation to respond to and recover from  adverse health effects of emergencies, supporting communities’ ability to  withstand adversity, strengthening health and response systems, and enhancing  national health security.
