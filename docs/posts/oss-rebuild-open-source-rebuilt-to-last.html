    <h1>OSS Rebuild: open-source, rebuilt to last</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since Cursor came out, I started low-key counting the days until I had to
switch away from vim / tmux. I took as a given that the productivity gains from an AI
powered editor would be too great to ignore, and started to see my insistence on
being terminal based as a my own little fun eccentric trait that would finally be gone soon...</p>
<p>And then agentic coding tools have taken an unexpected turn: The best ones are
terminal based and unixy. And at least in the case of Claude Code, for the same
reasons that initially drove me to the terminal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#39;So small and so flexible that it fits any workflow&#39;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&#39;The thinnest possible layer on top of the model&#39;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both phrases I&#39;ve heard from the creator.</p>
<p>I have been using it heavily in the last month: Initially i trialed it for prototypes and PoCs
at work, then making progress on personal projects that have been stuck for years in some cases,
but I can&#39;t stop finding new uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking around too much in the AWS console? Wait there&#39;s the aws-cli!</li>
<li>Debugging github actions? gh cli to the rescue</li>
<li>That thing i dread to do every 3 months where i have to duplicate 12
page documents and replace a few values? CC can figure out the binary format and
replace it for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s unlocking so many venues to explore that I had previously dismissed as too
tedious or too much work to do I just can&#39;t stop. I&#39;m not surprised to hear
the terms <a href="https://madhavajay.com/agentic-coding-slot-machines-did-we-just-summon-a-genie-addiction/">Slot Machine and Addiction</a>
and <a href="https://vimeo.com/1098025052">Sleep Problems</a>
thrown in the same sentence as agentic engineering,</p>
<p>The double twist is that now the editor matters significantly less, as I&#39;m using
it less and less. Maybe I can even look at vs-code. I don&#39;t really care.</p>
