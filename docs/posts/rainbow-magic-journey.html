<p><em>My friend Michael Nagle practices a therapeutic modality known as &#34;organic intelligence&#34;, which uses positive exploration to heal trauma. He is doing an experimental project to combine therapeutic sessions with AI image generation, and I did an experimental session with him. The idea is to explore images from dreams or imagination via painting them with the AI. I practice active imagination journaling so I have a lot of images to work with. During this session we got to explore some of my imaginary territory and find new connections. Here is the story that we built in the session with words and pictures:</em></p>
<p>I&#39;m in a cave. I was trapped in this cave for some time, and got to know its mysterious halls of reflection and echo which convinced me that someone else was somewhere in the labyrinth-- or maybe not, maybe it was just me and my echoes and my own reflection on the slick cave walls. I got to know its big cavern where I could tantalizingly see a shaft of sunlight and hear people occasionally above-- but could not find a way up.</p>
<p>Well, finally I did get out, and that was a long time ago. Out of some sort of impulse to face my fears and my past, I decide to go spelunking back in this old spot. This time a large ladder lets me down into the cavern safely, and my lantern lights up the halls of the cave. I go down the paths that I know so well, and get to the place where I thought I heard someone, all those years ago. I brought a pickaxe this time, and I see a place in the wall that looks cracked and fragile. I have a go at it and the wall breaks through easily.</p>
<p>On the other side of the wall there are bats, hundreds of them, and below the bats a deposit of guano, and all the creepy crawly things that are attracted to that. It is spooky and gross, but it is a sign of life, in contrast to the sterile place I broke through from. Where there are bats, there must be a way out of the cave. But I opt to turn around at this point, thinking that while the bats can get in and out, that doesn&#39;t mean it is safe for a person to travel there.</p>
<p>I return to the large cavern and climb up the ladder and onto a grassy hill. Outside the cave, night is falling. I decide to look for the entrance to the bat cave from the outside.</p>
<p>I climb down the hill, following my instinct for where the bat cave is underground. At the foot of the hill, I come to a fenced churchyard.</p>
<p><img alt="Conversations with Rocks" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/conversationswithrocks-1693867399-0.png"/></p>
<p>The churchyard has a large, gnarled old tree, with roses growing below it. There are bats flying around-- a good sign that I am near the cave entrance. I try the gate. It is locked.</p>
<p>In the middle of the gate there is a strange seal in the shape of a rainbow made of rainbow jewels. I stare at it as it sparkles and glows in the twilight, powered by some sort of magic. The glowing sparkles spread out from the gate.</p>
<p><img alt="Conversations with Rocks" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/conversationswithrocks-1693867472-0.png"/></p>
<p>The gate opens by magic, and the magic aura vanishes. Ahead I see a path.</p>
<p><img alt="Conversations with Rocks" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/conversationswithrocks-1693867511-0.png"/></p>
<p>I follow the path in the direction of the hill to the left, where I&#39;m sure the cave entrance must be. In the distance are hills with rock formations that look like they could be buildings.</p>
<p><img alt="Conversations with Rocks" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/conversationswithrocks-1693867556-0.png"/></p>
<p>I turn off the path and climb the hill a little ways, and come to a cave entrance. In the light of the moon I can see many bats flying in and out. This is it, the bat cave entrance.</p>

<p>It is enough, for tonight, to find the cave entrance. Later, perhaps, I will come back and explore it further.</p>
<p>As I walk back on the path, I reflect on my adventure. The rainbow seal reminds me of something in particular-- a different cave, a different day, a different adventure, but maybe something of the same magic. This was the adventure that day:</p>
<p>I find a bag full of beautiful jewels. There are so many and they are so obviously valuable that I don&#39;t know what to do with them. So I take them to the CEO.</p>
<p>I meet the CEO in a bright white space with nothing but light and two chairs. He greets me a little gruffly-- his time is not to be wasted. I take out the bag of jewels to show him, but when I open it, it is empty! Except for one small blue worthless rhinestone. I am embarassed, and the CEO is not surprised. There is no business to be done over a small rhinestone, obviously, but he gives me a card with a name and address on it, telling me that this person can help with &#34;problems like yours&#34;.</p>
<p>I go to the address on the card. It leads me to the Void, a former basement venue in Brighton. I go in. There is a small waiting area where there is a collection of acorns, maple spinners, and seeds in the corner, as if a small animal lives there.</p>
<p>Finally a red troll arrives and asks me what I am there for. I explain about the card and he is annoyed with me for coming without an appointment, but he shows me in. I descend a few steps into a large cavern. On the opposite wall of the cavern there are lightning-like cracks which glow from some hidden source. Diotema, the lady whose name is on the card, is hovering up on the left side of the cave, and speaking to someone on an invisible telephone, gossiping about this and that. Eventually she comes down to me, and asks what I am there for. I explain about the CEO and the card and how he said she might be able to help me with something-- I don&#39;t explain about the jewels and the bag. She asks me how I can pay her. I think of the bag, the jewels, and the poor worthless rhinestone. That would obviously not do.  I promise to make an appointment next time, and come with payment.</p>
<p>On the way out, I take another look in my bag. Instead of the blue stone, there is a beautiful rainbow brooch made of many precious stones! It is in the shape of a simple rainbow, a bit childish perhaps but clearly valuable due to the jewels. I wonder if I should wear it. I wonder what to say if anyone asks where I got it.</p>

<p>This symbol from this treasure found in a different cave was somehow there on the church gate! Mysterious. There must be some significance in the rainbow magic. There must be some connection between these different places, between these different stories, these different caves. I&#39;ll have to go back and explore further. That&#39;s all I have for now.</p>
