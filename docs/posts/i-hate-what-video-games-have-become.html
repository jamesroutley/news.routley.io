							<p>I hate loot boxes with a passion, there is this fun simple game called Rocket League, its about playing something like soccer but with cars,  a few years ago I paid around 20 dollars for it, back then you were able to earn all the garments (hats, wheels, et al) for your cars just by playing the game, 30 minutes per day were more than enough to get all the wardrobe, but as time went by they moved to a freemium model, now the game is free but there is blue-prints, keys, locked loot boxes, mechanics created for the single purpose of getting money for every single small change you want to make for your car, a game I spend more than 2000 hours is now a game I hate -and don’t play, of course-.</p><p>We used to laugh of people buying hats for barbie and now we are bigger fools than them, at least you can resell your barbie and resell the hat but we don’t have that privilege because Valve determined we are not worthy of it, once you stop playing a game 100% of the money you spend on it disappears, you can’t recover any of it, not 50%, not 20%, just nothing, doesn’t matter if you already spend $20 bucks on it or $3000.</p><p>Can you imagine if other art mediums where this ridiculous? Like you are watching Avengers End game in Netflix and they ask you if you wanna pay 5 dollars more to watch Captain America use his well known outfit instead of regular clothes? Or you are reading a cooking e-book that asks you for one dollar for each desert decoration recipe you want to unlock?</p><p>I’m atheist that prays to all the gods the old and the new ones that Valve, Epic, Microsoft and all the companies doing this popular but insidious business practice get sued into the ground, that the fine is so big that nobody will dare to try the same shenanigans about blocking reselling for a few decades.<br/></p>
