    <h1>Study reveals robotaxis causing surprisingly little disruption on streets</h1>

<p>The San Francisco Muni transit agency directed its drivers to make careful records of disruptions caused by the Cruise and Waymo self-driving robotaxis operating on San Francisco streets. We’ve seen a number of reports online, in regular and social media, of blockages and incidents, including the recent crash between a Cruise and a bus. As a result many have written as though there is a serious problem. But anecdotes are not the same as data.</p>


<p>Wired magazine <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dashcam-footage-shows-driverless-cars-cruise-waymo-clogging-san-francisco/" target="_blank" title="https://www.wired.com/story/dashcam-footage-shows-driverless-cars-cruise-waymo-clogging-san-francisco/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.wired.com/story/dashcam-footage-shows-driverless-cars-cruise-waymo-clogging-san-francisco/" aria-label="recently dug into Muni’s records and videos">recently dug into Muni’s records and videos</a>. Their headline says the opposite of what the data recovered say:</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>“Agency logs show 12 ‘driverless’ reports from September 2022 through March 8, 2023, ... Overall, the incidents resulted in at least 83 minutes of direct delays for Muni riders, records show.”</strong></p>

<hr/>
<p>As previously reported in their letter to the California PUC, “Autonomous cars in San Francisco made 92 unplanned stops between May and December 2022—88 percent of them on streets with transit service, according to city transportation authorities, who collected the data from social media reports, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/robot-cars-are-causing-911-false-alarms-in-san-francisco/" target="_blank" title="https://www.wired.com/story/robot-cars-are-causing-911-false-alarms-in-san-francisco/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.wired.com/story/robot-cars-are-causing-911-false-alarms-in-san-francisco/" aria-label="911 calls">911 calls</a>, and other sources, because companies aren’t required to report all the breakdowns.”</p>

<h3>12 reports in just over 6 months</h3>
<p>Considering the volume of traffic, having just 12 incidents in 6 months is an astonishingly good record, much better than many were led to believe by the anecdotal reports. Data are not provided on how many such events were caused by human drivers, double parkers and car breakdowns, but it seems likely the autnomous vehicles are causing trivial problems in comparison, as might be expected because while they probably drove a million miles in that period between the two companies, humans drive much more.</p>

<p>The question is often posed of how well the errors and problems of robotaxis should be tolerated while they are in development. It has to be expected that pilot projects and early deployments will result in higher amounts of mistakes and disruptions, and the only way to truly learn about and resolve problems is to be on the roads, taking the risk of such problems. There is much more concern over safety problems, particularly injury accidents. If people are getting hurt there is a stronger cause to measure that and make sure the risk remains with acceptable limits, such as the risk we accept from having human drivers ply the roads.</p>

<p>Because robotaxis offer the promise — indeed all the companies literally promise it — of being safer in the long term, reducing road risk significantly once they are at scale, it makes sense to tolerate some traffic disruption in order to work for that remarkable goal. As long as humans do most of the driving, there will continue to be carnage on our streets, and the chance to reduce that is worth a great deal of cost, both in money and traffic disruption.</p>


<p>Society already makes that decision when it allows student drivers on the road. Students and freshly minted licensed drivers are more dangerous and cause more traffic disruption. We accept them because it has been the only way to get them to learn and improve and turn into safer, better and more mature drivers.</p>
<p>With robots the benefit is much stronger. Letting a teen student on the road helps make that one driver better. The entire robot fleet is improved from anything learned from one robot. If a robotaxi blocks a street or has a fender-bender, the entire fleet will not make that mistake again.</p>
<p>From a standpoint of reducing risk, crashes and traffic disruption, it would be foolish to the extreme to slow down the deployment of this technology because of small issues during its pilot phases. We would rob our future — and literally rob some people of their futures — to avoid minor issues today.</p>
<p>Wired suggests there are likely to be unreported incidents, which is certainly true, but these numbers are so low that they could be greatly increased without reaching a threshold of concern.</p>
<p>The math is astonishingly clear. While the robots are young, their deployments are small, and their downsides inherently limited because of that. As they get more mature, they are deployed in vast numbers, and they provide vast benefits. The ratio of future benefit to present problem is one of thousands or even millions to one. Hundreds of less mature pilot cars are deployed today — which will put millions of mature cars on the roads sooner tomorrow. Absent injuries, it seems odd to even debate it.</p>
<p>The main question is, how good does a company have to be before they can begin or expand a pilot? Clearly vehicles could be so bad that their current issues would call for delay. Thanks to SF Muni’s study of the situation, showing just minutes of transit delay over 6 months, it’s very clear that Cruise and Waymo, at least are way, way beyond that point. That Muni wanted to delay the expansion of their pilots is surprising.</p>
<h3>Doing better?</h3>
<p>This does not mean that Cruise and Waymo should not do better. Cruise has had many more reports than Waymo and needs more improvement. Cruise has also had more crash events, including at least one with injuries, one with wires, and the one 2 weeks ago with a bus.</p>
<p>One particular problem has been a conservative approach regarding helping the cars when they encounter a problem. Companies are sometimes resorting to sending a “rescue” driver to physically travel to the car and manually drive it to resolve the problem. This can take 10 to 25 minutes, which is not a good situation. The plan for both companies is that they are able to resolve such situation with remote operators who give the car advice over the data networks. They have been relying on the rescue drivers enough as to cause disruption and resentment. Cruise has claimed that it does this because it always wants to take the safest choice, and a rescue driver is the sure and safe choice in a complex situation, but it is the slow one.</p>
<p>The companies need to get better at that equation. Both decided they will not use “remote driving” where the remote operator has a console with a wheel and pedals and drives the car like a radio controlled car. That depends on very good quality data connections and still has risks that a rescue driver does not. Nonetheless, it has the advantage of something that can be done without delay. The companies have to consider it, or getting more reliable with their remote assist. Even if these incidents are, as Muni reports, extremely rare, they still get a lot of attention that is magnified and reduces public confidence.</p>
