    <h1>Exposure Simulator</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="column3">
			<p>
				Note!  The exposure portion of this simulator currently does NOT work with Internet Explorer!  Please use Chrome or Firefox instead.
			</p>
			<p>
				This tool attempts to roughly simulate a final photograph given a particular set of camera settings.  The simulation includes demonstrating depth-of-field based on the current f/stop, as well as image &#34;noise&#34; or &#34;grain&#34; that is introduced into a picture as you increase the ISO.  If I ever find a good moving prop like a small fan, maybe I&#39;ll also re-shoot new previews to demonstrate how shutter speed affects moving objects.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Three shooting modes</b> are available, including &#34;Shutter Priority&#34; (Tv) and &#34;Aperture Priority (Av) modes, which all you to control one setting and have the camera auto-calculate the other for you to keep a proper exposure.  &#34;Manual&#34; mode gives you full control over the exposure.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Camera Setting Sliders</b> allow you to set the three primary variables used to control a photograph&#39;s exposure:
			</p><ul>
				<li>Shutter Speed</li>
				<li>F/Stop</li>
				<li>ISO</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				A camera meter is located above the simulated picture that should look similar to what you see inside your DSL&#39;s viewfinder, and will tell you whether the current exposure is underexposed or overexposed by up to three stops, or more if the arrow begins to blink.
