    <h1>The Many Planned Moon Landings of 2023</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-elid="2662222790" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/lunar-landing" data-authors="Ned Potter" data-headline="The Many Planned Moon Landings of 2023" data-page-title="Lunar Landings in 2023 - IEEE Spectrum"><div><p>It never gets any easier to watch: a control room full of engineers, waiting anxiously as the robotic probe they’ve worked on for years nears the surface of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/moon?__rblms_page_revalidate=1" target="_blank">the moon</a>. Telemetry from the spacecraft says everything is working; landing is moments away. But then the vehicle goes silent, and the control room does too, until, after an agonizing wait, the project leader keys a microphone to say the landing appears to have failed. </p><p>The last time this happened was in April, in this case to a privately funded Japanese mission called <a href="https://ispace-inc.com/news-en/?p=4655" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hakuto-R</a>. It was in many ways similar to crashes by Israel’s <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=2019-009B" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beresheet</a> and India’s <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan_2.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chandrayaan-2</a> in 2019. All three landers seemed fine until final approach. Since the 1970s, only <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/moon-water" target="_self">China</a> has successfully put any uncrewed ships on the moon (most recently in 2020); <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1976-081A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russia’s</a> last landing was in 1976, and the <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_17a_Summary.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United States</a> hasn’t tried since 1972. Why, half a century after the technological triumph of Apollo, have the odds of a safe lunar landing actually gone down? </p><p>The question has some urgency because five more landing attempts, by companies or government agencies from four different countries, could well be made before the end of 2023; the next, <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan3_New.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chandrayaan-3</a> from India, is scheduled for launch as early as this week. NASA’s administrator, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-administrator-bill-nelson/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bill Nelson</a>, has called this a “golden age” of spaceflight, culminating in the landing of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/artemis-1-revives-moonshot" target="_self">Artemis</a> astronauts on the moon late in 2025. But every setback is watched uneasily by others in the space community. </p><h3>2023 Possible Lunar Landings</h3><p><strong>India:</strong><a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan3_New.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chandrayaan-3</a>, from the Indian Space Research Organization, with a hoped-for launch in mid-July and, if that succeeds, a landing in August. </p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img id="fd71c" data-rm-shortcode-id="f9eef5950b0fbbfc0a3e91700554ef4d" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%201000%201000&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/model-of-gold-spacecraft-on-the-moon-with-a-small-rover.jpg?id=34309074&amp;width=980" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Model of gold spacecraft on the moon with a small rover"/><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Chandrayaan-3 could be heading to the moon soon.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">ISRO</small></p><p><strong>Russia:</strong><a href="https://tass.com/science/1625509" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Luna-25</a>, from the Roscosmos space agency, which currently says it plans an August launch. </p><p><strong>United States:</strong><a href="https://www.intuitivemachines.com/im-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nova-C IM-1</a>, from a private Houston-based company, <a href="https://www.intuitivemachines.com/" target="_blank">Intuitive Machines</a>, currently targeted for launch in the third quarter of 2023.</p><p><strong>United States:</strong><a href="https://www.astrobotic.com/lunar-delivery/landers/peregrine-lander/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peregrine Mission 1</a>, from the Pittsburgh-based company <a href="https://www.astrobotic.com/" target="_blank">Astrobotic Technology</a>, is waiting for modifications to its <a href="https://www.ulalaunch.com/rockets/vulcan-centaur" target="_blank">Vulcan Centaur</a> launch vehicle.

The company running Hakuto-R, <a href="https://www.ispace-inc.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ispace</a>, did an analysis of the crash and concluded that its software had perhaps been too clever for its own good. </p><p>According to <a href="https://ispace-inc.com/news-en/?p=4691" target="_blank">ispace</a>, the lander’s onboard sensors indicated a sharp rise in altitude when the craft passed over a 3-kilometer-high cliff. The cliff was later determined to be the rim of a crater. But the onboard computer had not been programmed for any cliff that high; it was told that in case of a large discrepancy in its expected position, the computer should assume something was wrong with the ship’s radar altimeter and disregard its input. The computer, said ispace, therefore behaved as if the ship were near touchdown when it was actually 5 km above the surface. It kept firing its engines, descending ever so gently, until its fuel ran out. “At that time, the controlled descent of the lander ceased, and it is believed to have free-fallen to the moon’s surface,” ispace said in a <a href="https://ispace-inc.com/news-en/?p=4691" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img id="ef71f" data-rm-shortcode-id="7d06173dad3c3aa6645b104ec703322b" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%201100%201100&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/grayscale-image-with-white-blotch-near-center.jpg?id=34309222&amp;width=980" width="1100" height="1100" alt="grayscale image with white blotch near center"/><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The crash site of the privately mounted Japanese Hakuto-R Mission 1 lunar lander, imaged by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center/Arizona State University</small></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/takeshi-hakamada-b096b14/?originalSubdomain=jp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Takeshi Hakamada</a>, the CEO of ispace, put a brave face on it. “We acquired actual flight data during the landing phase,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/CpR1UUnix3g?feature=share&amp;t=5731" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>. “That is a great achievement for future missions.”</p><p>Will this failure be helpful to other teams trying to make landings? Only to a limited extent, they say. As the so-called new space economy expands to include startup companies and more countries, there are many collaborative efforts, but there is also heightened competition, so there’s less willingness to share data.</p><h3>Better Technology, Tighter Budgets</h3><p>“Our biggest challenges are that we are doing this as a private company,” says <a href="https://www.astrobotic.com/company/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John Thornton</a>, the CEO of Astrobotic, whose Peregrine lander is waiting to go. “Only three nations have landed on the moon, and they’ve all been superpowers with gigantic, unlimited budgets compared to what we’re dealing with. We’re landing on the moon for on the order of $100 million. So it’s a very different ballgame for us.” </p><p>To put US $100 million in perspective: Between 1966 and 1968, NASA surprised itself by safely landing five of its seven <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1966-045A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Surveyor</a> spacecraft on the moon as scouts for Apollo. The cost at the time was $469 million. That number today, after inflation, would be about $4.4 billion.</p><p>Surveyor’s principal way of determining its distance from landing was radar, a mature but sometimes imprecise technology. <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/470/swati-mohan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Swati Mohan</a>, the guidance and navigation lead for NASA’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nasa-perseverance-rover-lands-at-mars-jezero-crater" target="_self">Perseverance rover</a> landing on Mars in 2021, likened radar to “closing your eyes and holding your hands out in front of you.” So Astrobotic, for instance, has turned to Doppler <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=lidar" target="_self">lidar</a>—laser ranging—which has about 10 times better resolution. It also uses <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/technology/technology-highlights/terrain-relative-navigation-landing-between-the-hazards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">terrain-relative navigation</a>, or TRN, a visually based system that takes rapid-fire images of the approaching ground and compares them to an onboard database of terrain images. Some TRN imagery comes from the same Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter that spotted Hakuto-R. </p><p>“Our folks are feeling good, and I think we’ve done as much as we possibly can to make sure that it’s successful,” says Thornton. But, he adds, “it’s an unforgiving environment where everything has to work.”</p><p><em><strong>13 July 2023 UPDATE:</strong> This story was updated to provide additional details on the launch plans for the Cert-1 mission.</em></p></div></div></div>
