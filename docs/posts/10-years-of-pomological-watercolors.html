  <p><strong>Hello <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44397168">Hacker News readers</a>!</strong> If you like this blog post, you may be interested to know that I&#39;m <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xor.blue/post/3lrqee7esmk2o">on the job market</a>. If you or your company is hiring and think I might be a good fit, please <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/parkerhiggins/">be in touch</a>.</p>

<p>A decade ago today I published a blog post calling for the US government to <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/04/us-government-release-7584-fruit-pictures/">release its paintings of fruits</a>. The Pomological Watercolor Collection, as I had recently come to know, is a beautiful and remarkable corpus of over 7,000 pictures of fruits and other biological specimens, made between the 1880s and 1940s. Through a handful of FOIA requests I’d learned that the images had been meticulously digitized and put online for purchase, but that less than 100 pictures had been sold that way — not nearly enough to justify the paywall.</p>

    <figcaption>There are so many beautiful pictures in this collection, but in this post I wanted to highlight some of the weirder ones.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was a strange rallying call, and certainly feels like it comes from a different era, but (if I may humbly say so) it worked. Within a few months, the National Agricultural Library put their high-resolution scans online, and they remain available to <a href="https://search.nal.usda.gov/discovery/collectionDiscovery?vid=01NAL_INST:MAIN&amp;collectionId=81279629860007426">search and download</a>. It’s easy for me to imagine a version of this story where I declared victory and moved on to the next thing.</p>

<p>But that’s not what I did! Now that the images were available, I wanted to <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:USDA_Pomological_Watercolors">add them to Wikimedia Commons</a>. In order to do so, I needed to create <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:PomologicalBot">some software that would handle the uploads</a>. This was my first ever project in Python, and in many ways, the start of my life as a programmer. The domino effect here is a little mind-boggling for me.</p>

<p>Emboldened by that foray into coding, I created a <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/11/new-bot-pomological/">Twitter bot to post through the collection</a>. Social media bots as a medium became pretty important to me. That account stopped posting when Twitter became X, approximately, but it continues to this day on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pomological.xor.blue">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://tech.intersects.art/@pomological">Mastodon</a>. I found other weird opportunities to highlight the collection. I gave a <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/10/vegetation-wants-to-be-free-a-wikicon-talk-on-pomological-watercolors/">short talk at the National Archives</a> for Wikicon 2015, made a <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2016/02/generative-tiled-watercolors-south-indian-music/">visualization video for a concert of carnatic music</a>, and added <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/foods/apple_cultivars.json">a thousand apple cultivars</a> to my favorite collection of datasets. I made buttons.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/assets/images/pomological/buttons.jpg" alt="Pinback buttons featuring a green &#39;Primate&#39; apple." title=""/>
    <figcaption>I made so many of these buttons that, ten years later and on the other side of the country, I still find them in nooks and crannies.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Most exciting to me, though, has been seeing the public collection flourish as I’d hoped it would. There has been <a href="https://atelier-editions.com/products/an-illustrated-catalog-of-american-fruits-nuts">a coffee table book</a>, <a href="https://www.kitchenartsandletters.com/products/heirloom-fruits-of-america">an academic exploration</a>, <a href="https://www.abbeville.com/products/fruit-an-abbeville-notecard-set">a postcard collection</a>, and <a href="https://20x200.com/products/vintage-watercolor-berry-trio">high-quality prints from an art seller</a>. The collection continues to get press attention — not just from interviews I did with sites like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/old-fruit-pictures-pomological-twitter-bot">Mashable</a> and <a href="http://www.morselnewyork.com/foodart/2017/10/3/over-100-years-ago">Morsel</a>, but in <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2019/06/the-us-government-commissioned-7500-watercolor-paintings.html">Open Culture</a>, <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/usda-watercolors">Atlas Obscura</a>, even a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/dining/make-stracciatella.html">shout-out from the New York Times</a>. Just this year it got a <a href="https://defector.com/i-demand-the-national-agricultural-library-publish-this-book-right-now">delightful write-up by Kelsey McKinney at Defector</a>, one of my favorites.</p>

</figure>

<p>I found the pomological watercolors through my <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/03/25-treasures-public-domain/">advocacy for the public domain</a> — a cause that can sometimes feel a little lonely and dispiriting. Embracing these artworks, though, has changed my life for the better in so many ways over the past decade. I don’t really have a big takeaway, and nobody’s asking for advice, but: I have been so grateful that I kept pulling that string and following my curiosity and interest. I sought out this collection on a lark, and I have now spent ten years surprised and delighted by what I found.</p>
