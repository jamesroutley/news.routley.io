    <h1>What I Plan to Build at Recurse Center - A 12 Week Programmer&#39;s Retreat</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DISCLOSURE: If you buy through affiliate links, I may earn a small commission. <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/disclosures">(disclosures)</a></p><div><p>I&#39;m doing a 12 week batch at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=afef2b4f097974aa990e8c4e8ae42a60">Recurse Center</a>.</p>
<p>In this post I wanted to outline my goals for the next 12 weeks.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-recurse-center">What is Recurse Center?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.recurse.com/about">RC is a programmer&#39;s retreat</a>. You can think of it like a writer&#39;s retreat for programmers - get together to think about and work on your porject, away from the external stimuli of a job - money, promos, reviews, etc.</p>
<p>They have <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives">3 guiding principles</a> but for the most part is self-directed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build at the edge of your abilities</li>
<li>Build your volitional muscles</li>
<li>Learn generously</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-plan-to-build">What I plan to build</h2>
<p>During my batch I want to build software I&#39;m excited and proud of, learn and grow, and get reacquainted with the fun of creation.</p>
<p>I have a few buckets I want to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video games and simulations.</strong> I&#39;ve always wanted to build a game and have dabbled with game engines and simulations in the past but never built one. By the end of the batch, I want to have a working game to help me learn about the space and process.</li>
<li><strong>Web fundamentals.</strong> I&#39;ve done a lot of web programming over the years but I haven&#39;t gone deeper. I want to build a web server from scratch and play around with core libraries - thinking the likes of Datastar, HTMX, and CinderblockHtml.</li>
<li><strong>Applied AI.</strong> <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-12_ai-is-here-to-stay">AI is here to stay</a> and <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-10_how-i-actually-use-ai">I use AI daily as a software engineer</a>. I don&#39;t want to just be a consumer of this tech, I want to understand how it works under the hood and start building / producing it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose buckets / themes rather than projects as I want to be flexible for new projects / ideas that come up. That&#39;s one of the big benefits of working in a batch so want to leave room for it.</p>
<h2 id="why-join-recurse-center">Why join Recurse Center?</h2>
<p>I could&#39;ve just built this stuff myself on the side but I felt Recurse Center was a cool opportunity.</p>
<p>A few things I&#39;m excited about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure</strong> - It&#39;s mostly self-directed but there&#39;s general structure for sharing projects, checking in on progress, and collaborating which I think will make it more fun and give me some accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Community + Collaboration</strong> - I&#39;m excited to learn, grow, and be inspired by what everyone else is building. Seems more fun that way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anecdotally, several of the fun / weird software projects I&#39;ve seen on the web in the past few years have come from people who attended RC and they enjoyed it so felt fun.</p>
<h2 id="next">Next</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re curious about what I end up building at RC, I&#39;ll be sharing them here.</p>
