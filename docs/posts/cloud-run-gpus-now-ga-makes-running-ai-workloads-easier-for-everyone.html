    <h1>Cloud Run GPUs, now GA, makes running AI workloads easier for everyone</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div jsname="tx2NYc"><section><div jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="M0Q3Qb"><p><span>Developers love </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/run"><span>Cloud Run</span><span>, Google Cloud’s serverless runtime, </span></a><span>for its simplicity, flexibility, and scalability. And today, we’re thrilled to announce that NVIDIA GPU support for Cloud Run is now generally available, offering a powerful runtime for a variety of use cases that’s also remarkably cost-efficient. </span></p>
<p><span>Now, you can enjoy the following benefits across both GPUs and CPUs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay-per-second billing</strong><span>: You are only charged for the GPU resources you consume, down to the second.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scale to zero</strong><span>: Cloud Run automatically scales your GPU instances down to zero when no requests are received, eliminating idle costs. This is a game-changer for sporadic or unpredictable workloads.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rapid startup and scaling</strong><span> Go from zero to an instance with a GPU and drivers installed in under 5 seconds, allowing your applications to respond to demand very quickly. For example, when scaling from zero (cold start), we achieved an impressive Time-to-First-Token of approximately 19 seconds for a gemma3:4b model (this includes startup time, model loading time, and running the inference)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full streaming support</strong><span>: Build truly interactive applications with out-of-the box support for HTTP and WebSocket streaming, allowing you to provide LLM responses to your users as they are generated.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Support for GPUs in Cloud Run is a significant milestone, underscoring our leadership in making GPU-accelerated applications simpler, faster, and more cost-effective than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span>“Serverless GPU acceleration represents a major advancement in making cutting-edge AI computing more accessible. With seamless access to NVIDIA L4 GPUs, developers can now bring AI applications to production faster and more cost-effectively than ever before.” </span><span>- Dave Salvator, director of accelerated computing products, NVIDIA</span></p></div></section><section></section><section><div jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="M0Q3Qb"><h3><strong>AI inference for everyone</strong></h3>
<p><span>One of the most exciting aspects of this GA release is that Cloud Run GPUs are now available to everyone for NVIDIA L4 GPUs, with </span><strong>no quota request required</strong><span>.This removes a significant barrier to entry, allowing you to immediately tap into GPU acceleration for your Cloud Run services. Simply use </span><code>--gpu 1</code><span> from the Cloud Run command line, or check the &#34;GPU&#34; checkbox in the console, no need to request quota:</span></p></div></section><section></section><section><div jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="M0Q3Qb"><h3><strong>Production-ready</strong></h3>
<p><span>With general availability, Cloud Run with GPU support is now covered by Cloud Run&#39;s </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/sla"><span>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</span></a><span>, providing you with assurances for reliability and uptime. By default, Cloud Run offers </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/zonal-redundancy"><span>zonal redundancy</span></a><span>, helping to ensure enough capacity for your service to be resilient to a zonal outage; this also applies to Cloud Run with GPUs. Alternatively, you can turn off zonal redundancy and benefit from a </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing"><span>lower price</span></a><span> for best-effort failover of your GPU workloads in case of a zonal outage.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Multi-regional GPUs</strong></h3>
<p><span>To support global applications, Cloud Run GPUs are available in five Google Cloud </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/locations#gpu"><span>regions</span></a><span>: us-central1 (Iowa, USA), europe-west1 (Belgium), europe-west4 (Netherlands), asia-southeast1 (Singapore), and asia-south1 (Mumbai, India), with more to come.</span></p>
<p><span>Cloud Run also </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/multiple-regions"><span>simplifies deploying your services across multiple regions</span></a><span>. For instance, you can deploy a service across the US, Europe and Asia with a single command, providing global users with lower latency and higher availability. For instance, here’s how to deploy </span><a href="https://ollama.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Ollama</span></a><span>, one of the easiest way to run open models, on Cloud Run across three regions:</span></p></div></section><section><section></section></section><section><div jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="M0Q3Qb"><h3><strong>See it in action: 0 to 100 NVIDIA GPUs in four minutes</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>What Cloud Run customers are saying</strong></h3>
<p><span>Don&#39;t just take our word for it. Here&#39;s what some early adopters of Cloud Run GPUs are saying:</span></p>
<p><span>&#34;Cloud Run helps vivo quickly iterate AI applications and greatly reduces our operation and maintenance costs. The automatically scalable GPU service also greatly improves the efficiency of our AI going overseas.”</span><span> - Guangchao Li, AI Architect, vivo</span></p>
<p><span>&#34;L4 GPUs offer really strong performance at a reasonable cost profile. Combined with the fast auto scaling, we were really able to optimize our costs and saw an 85% reduction in cost. We&#39;ve been very excited about the availability of GPUs on Cloud Run.&#34;</span><span> - John Gill at </span><a href="https://youtu.be/PWPvX25R6dM?feature=shared&amp;t=2496" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Next&#39;25</span></a><span>, Sr. Software Engineer, Wayfair</span></p>
<p><span><span>&#34;At Midjourney, we have found Cloud Run GPUs to be incredibly valuable for our image processing tasks. Cloud Run has a simple developer experience that lets us focus more on innovation and less on infrastructure management. Cloud Run GPU’s scalability also lets us easily analyze and process millions of images.</span><span>&#34; - Sam Schickler, Data Team Lead, Midjourney</span></span></p>
