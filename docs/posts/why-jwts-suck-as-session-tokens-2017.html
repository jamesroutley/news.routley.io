<p>JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are <em>so</em> hot right now. They’re all the rage in web
development:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trendy? ✓</li>
  <li>Secure? ✓</li>
  <li>Scalable? ✓</li>
  <li>Compact? ✓</li>
  <li>JSON? ✓</li>
</ul>

<p>With all these amazing things going for JWTs, they seem like an unstoppable hype
train headed straight for Stack Overflow fame and fortune!</p>

<p>But… today I’m here to talk with you about the downsides of using JWTs.
Specifically, why it’s a bad idea to use JWTs as session tokens for most people.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-jwts">What are JWTs?</h2>

<p>If you aren’t already familiar with JWTs, don’t panic! They aren’t that
complicated!</p>

<p>The way I like to think of JWTs is that they’re just some JSON data that you can
verify came from someone you know.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://developer.okta.com/assets-jekyll/blog/why-jwts-suck-as-session-tokens/json-web-token-06f38de1964cff3e3b8113d4d09a78f3850993d2cfaa6071d8d91b5f1c182690.png" alt="JSON Web Token"/></p>

<p>Pretend I’m blind and hard of hearing. Let’s also pretend that last week you
bought me lunch, and now I need your Venmo address to pay you back. If I ask you
for your Venmo address in person, and someone else shouts <em>their</em> Venmo address, I
might accidentally send <em>them</em> the money I owe <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>That’s because I heard <em>someone</em> shout a Venmo address, and I trusted that it
was <em>you</em>, even though in this case, it wasn’t.</p>

<p>JWTs were designed to prevent this sort of thing from happening. JWTs give
people an easy way to pass data between each other, while at the same time
verifying who created the data in the first place.</p>

<p>So, going back to our previous example, if I received 1,000,000 different
JWTs that contained a Venmo address, I’d easily be able to tell which one
actually came from you.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-jwts-work">How do JWTs Work?</h2>

<p>JWTs are JSON data, encoded as a string, and cryptographically signed. I know
that sounds fancy, but it really isn’t.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://developer.okta.com/assets-jekyll/blog/why-jwts-suck-as-session-tokens/jwt-formula-98ad833a15fd1a66ed577442529bd0f49a291dc849b53ebfe18036fe867c6375.png" alt="JSON Web Token Formula"/></p>

<p>The core of any JWT is claims. Claims are the JSON data inside the JWT. It’s the
data you care about, and want to pass along securely to someone else. I’m not
going into the details here, but just know that JWTs hold JSON data.</p>

<p>How do JWTs make it so that you know whether or not they can be trusted?
Cryptographic signatures.</p>

<p>Let’s say I write a letter. When I sign that letter, I’m “signing” it. This
means that anyone who reads that letter will know that I wrote it. And, because
my signature is unique, there will be no question of its authenticity.</p>

<p>Cryptographic signatures work in much the same way. There are two main ways to
“sign” JWTs cryptographically: using symmetric or asymmetric keys. Both types
are commonly used, and provide the same guarantees of authenticity.</p>

<h3 id="jwts-in-a-nutshell">JWTs in a Nutshell</h3>

<p>JWTs aren’t magic–they’re just blobs of JSON that have been cryptographically
signed. Regardless of whether they’re symmetrically or asymmetrically signed,
they provide the same guarantees: you can trust that a JWT is valid and created
by someone you have faith in.</p>

<p>These properties of JWTs make them really useful in certain scenarios where you
need to assert that some data can be trusted (such as when using federated
login/single sign-on).</p>

<h3 id="jwt-encryption-note">JWT Encryption Note</h3>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://developer.okta.com/assets-jekyll/blog/why-jwts-suck-as-session-tokens/key-sketch-e36f2c92ab546140fbcb7a5501cddc6f8500ad2169383dcbc14617bddb138d2a.png" alt="Key Sketch"/></p>

<p>One final note I want to make about JWTs before moving on: their contents (the
JSON data inside of them) are usually <strong>not</strong> encrypted. This means that anyone can
view the data inside the JWT, even without a key.</p>

<p>JWTs don’t try to encrypt your data so nobody else can see it, they simply help
you verify that it was created by someone you trust.</p>

<p>Now, if you <em>do</em> want to encrypt your JWTs you can do so by using <a href="http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-encryption.html" title="JSON Web Encryption">JWE</a>, but this is
not nearly as common as unencrypted JWTs. If you are using JWTs and need
encryption, be sure you use the right thing!</p>

<h2 id="how-are-people-using-jwts-today">How are People Using JWTs Today?</h2>

<p>The most common use case for JWTs is authentication. There are tons of web
security libraries which use JWTs as session tokens, API tokens, etc.</p>

<p>The idea is that when someone authenticates to a website/API, the server will
generate a JWT that contains the user’s ID, as well as some other critical
information, and then send it to the browser/API/etc. to store as a session
token.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://developer.okta.com/assets-jekyll/blog/why-jwts-suck-as-session-tokens/jwt-session-c66df0e71adcde705ac96cd3fd402b040222d35d956eda49249ec7e1717a738d.png" alt="JWT Session"/></p>

<p>When that user visits another page on the website, for instance, their browser
will automatically send that JWT to the server, which will validate the JWT to
make sure that it’s the same token it created originally, then let the user do
stuff.</p>

<p>In theory, this sounds nice because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the server receives a JWT, it can validate that it is legitimate and
trust that the user is whoever the token says they are</li>
  <li>The server can validate this token locally without making any network
requests, talking to a database, etc. This can potentially make session
management faster because instead of needing to load the user from a database
(or cache) on every request, you just need to run a small bit of local code.
This is probably the single biggest reason people like using JWTs: they are
stateless.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two perks sound great because they will speed up webapp performance,
reduce load on cache servers and database servers, and generally provide faster
experiences.</p>

<p>As a bonus benefit, as the webapp creator you can embed other information about
the user into your JWT:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User permissions</li>
  <li>User personal information</li>
  <li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that you can reduce your database load even further by simply
embedding extra user information in your tokens as well!</p>

<h2 id="why-do-jwts-suck">Why Do JWTs Suck?</h2>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://developer.okta.com/assets-jekyll/blog/why-jwts-suck-as-session-tokens/rage-face-55bec569ef91eb3e4ac1c0e9a73d4dea55bc40317c7f6b0594b1240e40774c71.jpg" alt="Rage Face" width="200"/></p>

<p>Now that we’ve seen how JWTs are used for authentication purposes, let’s get
into my favorite subject of all: why JWTs are not good session tokens.</p>

<p>I often argue with coworkers, colleagues, and friends about this, so it’s nice
to finally get all my thoughts on the subject down in bytes.</p>

<p>In particular, I plan to explain to you why normal old sessions are superior to
JWTs in almost every way.</p>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>Before I start making web developers all over the world angry, I want to provide
some context into my reasoning.</p>

<p>Most websites that developers build are relatively simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A user registers for the website</li>
  <li>A user signs into the website</li>
  <li>A user clicks around and does stuff</li>
  <li>The website uses the user’s information to create, update, and delete
information</li>
</ul>

<p>99.9% of all websites match the criteria above.</p>

<p>For these types of websites, what’s important to know is that almost every page
a user interacts with contains some sort of dynamic data. Odds are, if you’re
running a website that requires a user to sign in to use it, you’re going to be
doing things with that user in your database often:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recording the actions a user is taking</li>
  <li>Adding some data for the user to the database</li>
  <li>Checking a user’s permissions to see if they can do something</li>
  <li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The important thing to remember is that most sites require user information for
nearly every operation.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let’s get into the reasons why JWTs suck. First up?
Size.</p>

<h3 id="size">Size</h3>

<p>Let’s take a look at two scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Storing a user ID (abc123) in a cookie</li>
  <li>Storing a user ID (abc123) in a JWT</li>
</ul>

<p>If we store the ID in a cookie, our total size is 6 bytes. If we store the ID in
a JWT (with basic header fields set, as well as a reasonably long secret), the
size has now inflated to 304 bytes. For storing a simple user session, that is a
~51x size inflation on every single page request in exchange for cryptographic
signing (as well as some header metadata).</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://developer.okta.com/assets-jekyll/blog/why-jwts-suck-as-session-tokens/jwt-size-ebcb2b17aa020f57558a7293b3a137e714f15dde155209c9fafabfe5170ca034.png" alt="JWT Size"/></p>

<p>For reference, here were the JWT claims I used to get that number:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;iss&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;https://api.mywebsite.com&#34;</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;sub&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;abc123&#34;</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;nbf&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1497934977</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;exp&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1497938577</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;iat&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1497934977</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;jti&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;1234567&#34;</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;typ&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;authtoken&#34;</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s say that your website gets roughly 100k page views per month. That means
you’d be consuming an additional ~24MB of bandwidth each month. That doesn’t
sound like a lot, but when you’re consistently bloating every single page
request, all the little things start to add up.</p>

<p>Also: this example was using the smallest possible amount of information encoded
in a JWT. In reality, many people end up storing much more information in JWTs
than just a user ID, greatly increasing these byte counts.</p>

<h3 id="youre-going-to-hit-the-database-anyway">You’re Going to Hit the Database Anyway</h3>

<p>As I mentioned above, most websites that require user login are primarily
generating dynamic user content for CRUD operations (create, update, delete).</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://developer.okta.com/assets-jekyll/blog/why-jwts-suck-as-session-tokens/youll-hit-the-db-anyway-85a764cb73ced955780a92f916beb446d00b197c7cdf1e47385be9aed584f872.png" alt="You&#39;ll Hit the DB Anyway"/></p>

<p>The issue with using JWTs on these websites is that for almost every single page
the user loads, the user object needs to be loaded from a cache / database
because one of the following situations are occurring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A mission critical user check needs to run (eg: does this user have enough
money in their account to complete the transaction?)</li>
  <li>A database write needs to occur to persist information (if this information is
related to the user, it’s likely that the full user object must also be
retrieved from the database)</li>
  <li>The full user object must be pulled out of the cache / database so that the
website can properly generate its dynamic page content</li>
</ul>

<p>Think about the websites you build. Do they often manipulate user data? Do they
frequently use various fields on the user account to work? If so, your site
falls into this category, and you’ll likely be talking to the cache server /
database regardless of whether or not you’ve got a JWT.</p>

<p>This means that on most websites, the stateless benefits of a JWT are not being
taken advantage of.</p>

<p>To compound this issue, since JWTs are larger (in bytes) and also require CPU to
compute cryptographic signatures, they’re actually significantly slower than
traditional sessions when used in this manner.</p>

<p>Almost every web framework loads the user on every incoming request. This
includes frameworks like Django, Rails, Express.js (if you’re using an
authentication library), etc. This means that even for sites that are primarily
stateless, the web framework you’re using is still loading the user object
regardless.</p>

<p>Finally: if you’re storing your user information in a modern cache like
memcached/redis, it’s not uncommon over a VPC to achieve cache GET times of 5ms
or below, which is <em>extremely</em> fast. I’ve personally used DynamoDB on Amazon in
the past as a session store, and consistently achieved 1ms cache retrieval
times. Because caching systems are so fast, there’s very little performance
overhead when retrieving users in this manner.</p>

<h3 id="redundant-signing">Redundant Signing</h3>

<p>One of the main selling points of JWTs are cryptographic signatures. Because
JWTs are cryptographically signed, a receiving party can verify that the JWT is
valid, and trusted.</p>

<p>But… what would you say if I told you that in pretty much every single web
framework created over the last 20 years, you could also get the benefits of
cryptographic signatures when using plain old session cookies?</p>

<p>Well, you can =)</p>

<p>Most web frameworks cryptographically sign (and many encrypt!) your cookies for
you automatically. This means that you get the exact same benefits as using JWT
signatures without using JWTs themselves.</p>

<p>In fact, in most web authentication cases, the JWT data is stored in a session
cookie anyways, meaning that there are now two levels of signing. One on the
cookie itself, and one on the JWT.</p>

<p>While having two levels of signing may sound like a good idea, it is not. You
get no security benefits, and you’ve now got to spend twice as long on CPU
cycles to validate both signatures. Not really ideal for web environments where
milliseconds are important. This is especially true in single threaded
environments (cough cough <em>nodejs</em>) where number crunching can block your main
event loop.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-better-solution">What’s a Better Solution?</h2>

<p>If JWTs suck, then what’s a better solution? Plain old sessions!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://developer.okta.com/assets-jekyll/blog/why-jwts-suck-as-session-tokens/sessionid-vs-jwt-3db76c728244b12c8a71d064c045216b7609bbe5468433c54845edffc2f1674d.png" alt="SessionID vs JWT"/></p>

<p>If you’re building a simple website like the ones described above, then your
best bet is to stick with boring, simple, and secure server side sessions.
Instead of storing a user ID inside of a JWT, then storing a JWT inside of a
cookie: just store the user ID directly inside of the cookie and be done with
it.</p>

<p>If your website is popular and has many users, cache your sessions in a backend
like memcached or redis, and you can easily scale your service with very little
hassle.</p>

<p>Excellent quality web frameworks like Django know this, which is why they
operate this way.</p>

<h2 id="how-should-i-use-jwts">How Should I Use JWTs?</h2>

<p>It’s important to note that I don’t hate JWTs. I just think they’re useless for
a majority of websites. With that said, however, there are several cases in
which JWTs can be useful.</p>

<p>If you’re building API services that need to support server-to-server or
client-to-server (like a mobile app or single page app (SPA)) communication,
using JWTs as your API tokens is a very smart idea. In this scenario:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You will have an authentication API which clients authenticate against, and
get back a JWT</li>
  <li>Clients then use this JWT to send authenticated requests to other API services</li>
  <li>These other API services use the client’s JWT to validate the client is
trusted and can perform some action without needing to perform a network
validation</li>
</ul>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://developer.okta.com/assets-jekyll/blog/why-jwts-suck-as-session-tokens/good-jwt-example-acc793ee5fa4143ed97670e367bc29167cbb7cc570729f6ce09601191a7c4dab.png" alt="Good JWT Example"/></p>

<p>For these types of API services, JWTs make perfect sense because clients will be
making requests frequently, with limited scope, and usually authentication data
can be persisted in a stateless way without too much dependence on user data.</p>

<p>If you’re building any type of service where you need three or more parties
involved in a request, JWTs can also be useful. In this case the requesting
party will have a token to prove their identity, and can forward it to the third
(or 4th … nth) service without needing to incur a real-time validation each
and every time.</p>

<p>Finally: if you’re using user federation (things like single sign-on and OpenID
Connect), JWTs become important because you need a way to validate a user’s
identity via a third party. Thanks to cryptographic signing, JWTs make a
valuable addition to federated user protocols.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>

<p>When you start building your next website, just rely on your web framework’s
default authentication libraries and tools, and stop trying to shove JWTs into
the mix unnecessarily.</p>
