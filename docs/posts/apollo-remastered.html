<p>NASA keeps the original film negatives from the Apollo program sealed in a frozen vault in Houston, TX and rarely grants access to them. As a result, nearly all of the photos we see of those historic missions were made decades ago or are copies of copies. Recently, the film was cleaned and digitally scanned at &#34;an unprecedented resolution&#34;.</p>

<p>Using these new high-res scans, image specialist Andy Saunders remastered each of the 35,000 photographs, resulting in this incredible-looking book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0762480246/ref=nosim/0sil8">Apollo Remastered: The Ultimate Photographic Record</a>. From <a href="https://www.apolloremastered.com/">the book&#39;s website</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The photographs from the lunar surface are as close as we can get to standing on the Moon ourselves, and for the first time, we were able to look back at Earth from afar, experiencing the &#34;overview effect&#34; â€” the cognitive shift that elicits an intense emotional experience upon seeing our home planet from space for the first time. The &#34;Blue Marble&#34; photograph, taken as Apollo 17 set course for the Moon, depicts the whole sunlit Earth, and is the most reproduced photograph of all time. Along with Apollo 8&#39;s &#34;Earthrise,&#34; which depicts Earth above the lunar horizon, it was a catalyst for the environmental movement that continues today.</p></blockquote>

<p>Saunders is also <a href="https://www.apolloremastered.com/shop">selling prints of some of these remastered photos</a>, which look absolutely stunning.</p>
