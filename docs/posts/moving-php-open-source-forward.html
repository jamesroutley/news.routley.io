<p>At JetBrains, we want the PHP community to shine. First and foremost, we do this by building <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PhpStorm</a>, the best IDE for PHP development; but we also <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/">support and help drive the PHP Foundation</a>; have just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0bgkxUS9EaI6rjDdRvihJn90OztDsxTO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organised PHPverse</a>, accessible for everyone worldwide; and recently we made the <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2025/07/laravel-idea-is-now-free/">Laravel Idea plugin free for all</a>.</p>



<p>On top of that, we <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support open-source projects</a> that we believe impact the PHP community or have the potential to do so, and which will benefit from our financial support. </p>



<p>Our support includes <strong>free PhpStorm licenses</strong> for active open source maintainers, but also <strong>financial sponsorships</strong>. With this blog post, we’d like to announce a new round of sponsorships, as well as a more structured approach towards new open source sponsorships in the future.</p>



<h2>Sponsorships 2025-2026</h2>



<p>Our strategy from now on is to sponsor around five open-source projects and maintainers per year. Each year we’ll select new projects to diversify our support.</p>



<p>Here are the people we’ll sponsor for the coming year:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/azjezz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saif Eddin Gmati</a>, who’s building a very promising new linter and static analyzer for PHP in Rust: <a href="https://github.com/carthage-software/mago" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mago</a>.</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/staabm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markus Staab</a>, who’s involved in tons of existing open-source projects like PHPStan, Rector, and PHPUnit.</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/CodeWithKyrian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyrian Obikwelu</a>, who’s actively exploring AI and MCP possibilities in PHP.</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/SjonHortensius" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sjon Hortensius</a>, who’s responsible for <a href="http://3v4l.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3v4l.org</a>, an online shell for PHP that’s very popular within the PHP community.</li>
</ul>



<p>You may have noticed there’s still one spot open. Maybe you know just the right person or project to add to this list? Feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:brent.roose@jetbrains.com">brent.roose@jetbrains.com</a> with your suggestions, or leave a comment below this blog post!</p>



<p>Apart from sponsoring individual projects, we also stay committed to sponsoring the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PHP Foundation</a>, and encourage as many organizations to do so as well.</p>


    







<p>Finally, because of this new yearly system, we also stopped sponsoring two projects we’ve supported for many years. Not because we don’t believe in them anymore, but because we want to make sure we can support as many different projects as possible over time. Maybe this is a good time to take a look if you or your company can pick up new sponsorships as well?</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/derickr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Derick Rethans</a>, who’s working on Xdebug</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/jrfnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juliette Reinders Folmer</a>, who’s working on CodeSniffer</li>
</ul>



<p>We believe in the power of open-source. We want to support it and encourage you to do the same if you have the means to do so. </p>



<p>Let’s work together to make PHP even better!</p>
