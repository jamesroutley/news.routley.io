                            <p>Started as a two-person project in 1997, GNOME has undergone massive growth in the last 25 years. Today we’re an open source software project and a nonprofit Foundation supported by a diverse community of contributors from all over the world.</p>
                            <p>Our progress never stops! We believe in a world where everyone is empowered by technology they can trust, and we support this goal by building a diverse and sustainable free software personal computing ecosystem.</p>

                                    <p>On August 15, 1997, the development of GNOME was <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/1997-August/msg00123.html" target="_blank">announced</a> with the following: <strong>“We want to develop a free and complete set of user-friendly applications and desktop tools, similar to CDE and KDE but based entirely on free software.”</strong> by Miguel de Icaza &amp; Federico Mena Quintero.</p>

                                        <p>On March 3, 1999, the first major version of GNOME was released as GNOME 1.0. The GIMP ToolKit (GTK+) was chosen as the base for GNOME and a major effort was devoted to offering a friendly platform for developers, supporting many programming languages. There were 3 subsequent releases over the next two years in the GNOME 1.x series. One of them was 1.4, and you can test it in a Virtual Machine. <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/misc/GNOME1.4.ova">Download it here</a>. (user: gnome / password: gnomehistory).</p>
                                        <p>GNOME libraries and applications were made available for use in any application under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License and the GNU General Public License.</p>

For many, it was the first time they’d met in person. Since then GUADEC has been held annually, organized by Foundation Staff, community contributors, and local volunteers.</p>

                                    <p>The GNOME Foundation was announced at the Linux World Expo in San Jose, CA in August 2000. The Foundation provides organizational, financial, and legal support to the GNOME project. Partnerships with companies were also announced, including Red Hat, Compaq, Eazel, Helix Code, IBM, Sun Microsystems, and VA Linux Systems. The Foundation was ultimately incorporated as a nonprofit.</p>

GNOME 2.0 was the first release in the 2.x series, which saw 16 more releases over the next 9 years.</p>
                                        <p> The introduction of the Human Interface Guidelines (HIG), allowed for a more predictable and consistent interface for users. GNOME 2 also had a host of advanced accessibility features for users with disabilities along with a built-in accessibility framework for developers to meet Section 508 requirements.</p>

                                        <p>GNOME 3.0 was an exciting new desktop designed for today’s users and which is suited to a range of modern computing devices. GNOME’s developer technologies were substantially improved for 3.0. Modernised and streamlined, they enable developers to provide better user experiences with less time and effort.</p>
                                        <p>The most important goal of GNOME 3 was defined as the unification of the user experience. Many flaws were identified in the GNOME 2 desktop related to windows, workspaces and application launching, some of which were labor-intensive and prone to errors. A much more holistic approach was needed to take it to the next level.</p>

                                        <p>With the onset of a global pandemic we need to move to a fully-remote version of GUADEC. We introduced our new instance of Indico as an all encompassing event platform capable of handling everything from Call for Participation to registration and scheduling. We utilized a new system - Big Blue Button - for hosting presentations and chat. This new remote GUADEC had over 700 registrations, making the 2020 edition our most attended GUADEC yet.</p>
                                        <p>As part of our transition to remote events we developed the <a href="https://shop.gnome.org/" target="_blank">GNOME Shop</a>, an online merchandise store where we can sell event t-shirts, as well as many other GNOME branded items, and ship all over the world.</p>
