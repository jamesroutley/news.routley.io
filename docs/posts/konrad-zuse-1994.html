      <p>Born June 22, 
          1910, Berlin-Wilmersdorf; German inventor of pre-war electromechanical 
          binary computer designated Z1 which was destroyed without trace by 
          wartime bombing; developed two more machines before the end of the war 
          but was unable to convince the Nazi government to support his work; fled
          with the remains of Z3 to Zurich where he developed the Z4 which was 
          successfully used at ETH.  Developer of a basic programming system known
          as &#34;Plankalkül&#34; with which he designed a chess playing program. <i>Education and Experience:</i> By 1927 Konrad Zuse had enrolled at the
          Technical University in Berlin-Charlottenburg and began his working 
          career as a design engineer (Statiker) in the aircraft industry 
          (Henschel Flugzeugwerke) and by 1935 he had completed a degree in civil 
          engineering. He remained in Berlin from the time he finished his degree 
          until the end of the war in 1945, and it was during this time that he 
          constructed his first digital computers. He later formed his own company
          for the construction and marketing of his designs. </p>
      <p>During 1936 to 1938 Konrad Zuse developed and built the first binary 
        digital computer in the world (Zl). A copy of this computer is on 
        display in the Museum for Transport and Technology (&#34;Museum fur Verkehr 
        und Technik&#34;) (since 1989) in Berlin.</p>
      <p>The first fully functional program-controlled electromechanical 
        digital computer in the world (the Z3) was completed by Zuse in 1941, 
        but was destroyed  in 1944 during the war. Because of its historical 
        importance, a copy was made in 1960 and put on display in the German 
        Museum (&#34;Deutsches Museum&#34;) in Munich. </p>
      <p>Next came the more sophisticated Z4, which was the only Zuse 
        Z-machine to survive the war. The Z4 was almost complete when, due to 
        continued air raids, it was moved from Berlin to Gottingen where it was 
        installed in the laboratory of the Aerodynamische Versuchanstalt 
        (DVL/Experimental Aerodynamics Institute). It was only there for a few 
        weeks before Gottingen was in danger of being captured and the machine 
        was once again moved to a small village &#34;Hinterstein&#34; in the 
        Allgau/Bavaria. Finally it was taken to Switzerland where it was 
        installed in the ETH (Federal Polytechnical Institute/&#34;Eidgenossisch 
        Technische Hochschule&#34;) in Zurich in 1950. It was used in the Institute 
        of Applied Mathematics at the ETH until 1955. </p>
      
      <h3>My first computer and first thoughts about data processing</h3>
      <p>I started in 1934, working independently and without knowledge of 
        other developments going on around me.  In fact, I hadn&#39;t even heard of 
        Charles Babbage when I embarked on my work.  At that time, the computing
        industry was limited to mechanical calculators using the decimal 
        system.  Punched card devices were slightly further developed and able 
        to deal with relatively complex operations for statistical and 
        accounting purposes.  However, these machines were almost entirely 
        designed for commercial application.  This meant that mathematicians and
        engineers had to develop computers on their own, working independently 
        from one another.  I was no exception.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the 30s, while studying civil engineering in 
        Berlin, I decided to develop and build bigger calculating machines, more
        suitable for engineering purposes.  I approached the problem from 
        various angles: </p>
      <p><u>Firstly, from a logical and mathematical point of view:</u> </p>
      <p>This involved </p>
      <p>3.  and floating point arithmetic. </p>
      <p>Today, these concepts are taken for granted, but at the time this was new ground for the computing industry. </p>
      <p><u>Secondly, from the design angle:</u> </p>
      <p>3.  and modules or relays operating on the yes/no principle. </p>
      <p>My research was initially aimed at pure number calculation, but 
        soon led on (1935/36) to new ideas about &#34;computing&#34; in general.  
        Personally, I believe that was the birth of modern computer science.  I 
        recognized that computing could be seen as a general means of dealing 
        with data and that all data could be represented through bit patterns, 
        generally speaking. </p>
      <p>That led to my basic hypothesis that: </p>
      <p>&#34;data processing starts with the bit&#34; </p>
      <p>At that time, of course, I didn&#39;t talk of &#34;bits&#34;, but of &#34;yes/no 
        status&#34;.  On the basis of this hypothesis I defined &#34;computing&#34; as </p>
      <p>&#34;the formation of new data from input according to a given set of rules&#34; </p>
      <p>This basic theory meant that all computing operations could be 
        carried out by relays operating according to the dual status principle 
        just mentioned.  The most suitable devices available at the time were 
        telephone relays. </p>
      <p>Now a link with mathematical logic had been forged.  As an 
        engineer I had no idea of the existence of such a discipline.  I 
        developed a system of &#34;conditional propositions&#34; for relays - something 
        that corresponded approximately to what is known as Boolean algebra 
        today.  My former mathematics teacher showed me that this sort of 
        calculation was identical with the propositional calculus of 
        mathematical logic. </p>
      <p>From the engineering point of view, the gap between this and pure
        mathematical logic was bridged in order to simplify the design and 
        programming of computing machines.  At roughly the same time in England,
        the mathematician and logician Alan Turing was in the process of 
        solving this problem from a different angle.  He used a very simple 
        computer as a model in order to place theoretical logic on a more formal
        basis.  Turing&#39;s work was of major importance for the theory of 
        computer science.  However, his ideas had little influence on the 
        practical development of computing machines. </p>
      <p>The theories needed to be put into practice.  First of all 
        high-capacity memories had to be designed.  At that time, (1935), memory
        consisted of single registers operating a system of numbered wheels 
        using the decimal system.  Typical problems were the input and retrieval
        of information, as well as the choice of counters.  Capacity was fairly
        restricted, although some punch card machines were able to deal with up
        to 20 counters.  These machines generally functioned on the basis that a
        number could be &#34;added on&#34;. </p>
      <p>But a new problem had to be overcome: pure memory was needed 
        without the adding-on facility, but with high capacity and a special 
        selection facility, as well as an elegant way of communicating with the 
        periphery.  I thought it was a good idea to base such a memory device on
        binary numbers from the outset.  My idea was to divide the machine up 
        into cells which would be able to hold data for a complete number, in 
        other words, the operational sign, exponent and mantissa (where a 
        floating point was being used), as well as additional specifications.  
        Using the yes-no principle a &#34;word&#34; - as we would call it today - could 
        be formed from a series of bits.  The memory elements only needed to 
        store yes-no values. </p>
      <p>One device that could deal with this type of operation was the 
        electro-magnetic relay, which can adopt two positions, &#34;open&#34; or 
  &#34;closed&#34;.  However, at the time I felt that the problem could be better 
        solved mechanically.  I played around with all sorts of levers, pins, 
        steel plates, and so on, until I finally reached what was a very useful 
        solution, for those days.  My device consisted mainly of pins and steel 
        plates, and in principle could be extended to 1,000 words.  A proper 
        machine using telephone relays would have needed 40,000 relays and 
        filled a whole room. </p>
      <p>The basic principle was that a small pin could be positioned 
        right or left of a steel lug, thus memorizing the value 0 or 1.  Input 
        and retrieval were also effected via a steel-plate construction, and the
        individual parts could be stacked on top of one another in a system of 
        layers.  The address system also used binary code.[2] These machines had
        the advantage of being made almost entirely of steel, which made them 
        suitable for mass production. </p>
      <p>Individual memory elements could be easily arranged in matrix 
        form, which was very useful as far as constructing computers was 
        concerned.  Not only was a number memory now available, but it could 
        also be used to store general data drawn from practically any source.  
        Logic studies conducted at the same time had already shown that general 
        calculations with any sort of data structure were possible, and that 
        this data could be made up entirely of bit combinations.  That is why I 
        had already called the storage system a &#34;combination memory&#34; in the 
        patent application. </p>
      <p>This was something new on the Babbage designs.  It was clear that
        programs could be stored provided they were composed of bit 
        combinations - one reason why programmable memory had already been 
        patented by 1936. </p>
      <p>In the course of pursuing the basic principles of mechanical 
        memory I developed a mechanical relay technology.  This I applied to 
        both programming and calculating parts.  At the time it was not clear 
        whether all operations could be run according to the yes-no principle, 
        or even whether that was a good idea.  That was something that was only 
        discovered later after much hard work.  Initially I developed various 
        adding machines for binary numbers which used elements providing up to 
        three or four positions.  This was done using both electro-magnetic and 
        mechanical relays.  Finally I found a solution which worked on the 
        yes-no principle alone.  By this time the similarities between 
        essentially very different technologies were becoming increasingly 
        obvious.  I was faced with the choice of using either telephone relays 
        or mechanical technology for my computing machine.  As mechanical memory
        had proved successful (I was able to build a working model in six 
        weeks), and because of the frightening number of relays needed in the 
        alternative system, (around 1,000), I decided in favor of the mechanical
        version, at first. </p>
      <p>Inventors are often faced with that sort of decision.  Today, I 
        know that opting for relays immediately would have been better.  
        However, working on a completely private basis, with- just the help of 
        some friends, I started to construct a mechanical model of the computer.
        At first I thought it would be possible to produce it quickly.  In 
        fact it took two years to set up a half-way functioning machine which I 
        could present to the experts.  Unfortunately the surviving photos are 
        not very good and the machine itself proved somewhat unreliable! In 
        fact, with the help of switching algebra, it proved easy to convert 
        mechanical relay circuits for use in electro-magnetic relay technology. </p>
      <p>At this point I would like to mention my friend Helmut Schreyer 
        who was working on the development of electronic relays at that time.  
        Helmut was a high-frequency engineer, and on completing his studies 
        (around 1936) started working at Prof.  Stäblein&#39;s Institute at the 
        Technical University in Berlin-Charlottenburg.  Helmut, who was a close 
        personal friend of mine, suddenly had the bright idea of using vacuum 
        tubes.  At first I thought it was one of his student pranks - he was 
        always full of fun and given to fooling around.  But after thinking 
        about it we decided that his idea was definitely worth a try.  Thanks to
        switching algebra, we had already married together mechanics and 
        electro-magnetics - two basically different types of technology.  Why, 
        then, not with tubes? They could switch a million times faster than 
        elements burdened with mechanical and inductive inertia. </p>
      <p>The possibilities were staggering.  But first basic circuits for 
        the major logical operations such as conjunction, disjunction and 
        negation had to be discovered.  Tubes could not simply be connected in 
        line like relay contacts.  We agreed that Helmut should develop the 
        circuits for these elementary operations first, while I dealt with the 
        logical part of the circuitry.  Our aim was to set up elementary 
        circuits so that relay technology could be transferred to the tube 
        system on a one-to-one basis.  This meant the tube machine would not 
        have to be redesigned from scratch.  Schreyer solved this problem fairly
        quickly. </p>
      <p>This left the way open for further development.  We cautiously 
        told some friends about the possibilities.  The reaction was anything 
        from extremely skeptical to spontaneously enthusiastic.  Interestingly 
        enough, most criticism came from Schreyer&#39;s colleagues, who worked with 
        tubes virtually all the time.  They were doubtful that an apparatus with
        2,000 tubes would work reliably.  This critical attitude was the result
        of their own experience with large transmitters which contained several
        hundred tubes.  Apart from that, conditions were not exactly propitious
        for the development of a fully tube-operated machine.  The War had 
        broken out in the interim, making the procurement of staff and material 
        very difficult.  Nothing could be done by private initiative.  We 
        therefore proposed the construction of a 2,000-tube computer for special
        use in anti-aircraft defense to the military authorities.  Although the
        reaction was initially sympathetic towards the project we were asked 
        simply, &#34;How much time do you think you need for it?&#34;.  We replied, 
  &#34;Around two years.  The response to this was, &#34;And just how long do you 
        think it&#39;ll take us to win the war?&#34;.  The outcome was considerable 
        obstruction and delay in the development of a German electronic 
        computing machine.  Schreyer was by now fully engaged in other projects.
        By the end of the War he had constructed a small experimental machine 
        for 10 binary digits and around 100 tubes.  But this machine was also 
        lost in the general confusion just after the War. </p>
      <p>After the War was finally over, news of the University of 
        Pennsylvania ENIAC machine went all round the world - &#34;18,000 tubes!&#34;.  
        We could only shake our heads.  What on earth were all the tubes for? 
        Schreyer and I parted company after the War.  At that time it was 
        prohibited to develop electronic equipment in West Germany.  As Schreyer
        saw no means of continuing his very interesting research he emigrated 
        to Brazil to take up a university chair. </p>
      <p>Schreyer died in 1985. </p>
      <p>The English development known as COLOSSUS was unheard of outside 
        the circle of those working on it.  It was only much later that the 
        wraps came off this very interesting project.  In 1980 Schreyer and I 
        had the opportunity to speak to the COLOSSUS people in England.  We 
        compared our circuits and it turned out that there were considerable 
        similarities.  The English had also been working on logical operations 
        and other similar design principles. </p>
      <p>By the end of 1938 it seemed clear that electro-magnetic relays 
        offered the best chance of producing a reliable operating computer 
        quickly.  Before I redesigned the Z1 to operate completely with relays I
        made a test with a small pilot machine, the Z2.  I used the mechanical 
        memory of the Z1 with a low storage capacity (16 words), as well as the 
        card punch and reader to build a simple computer with 200 relays 
        operating with 16 bits and on the basis of fixed- point arithmetic. </p>
      <p>Young transmitter specialists, including Schreyer and other 
        friends of mine, helped me design the circuits and choose the 
        appropriate components.  But although their advice was a great help, to a
        certain extent I expressly set out to explore new ground.  The most 
        important thing seemed to be to keep the frequency absolutely even, so 
        that one cycle equaled one addition, itself comprising several steps.  
        Frequency was set using rotating disks or rollers which were covered in 
        alternating strips of conducting and non-conducting material, contact 
        being made via carbon brushes This principle had many advantages.  Tests
        could be run on the machine at any speed.  Another advantage was that 
        spark extinction took place at the brushes and not at the relay contacts
        when circuits were being shutdown.  Despite well-meaning advice from 
        some friends, I did not make use of certain well-known telephone 
        communication tricks such as delayed-response relays. </p>
      <p>All in all, I was able to gather enough experience with the Z2 in
        order to convert the complete Z1 design for relay operation.  What 
        emerged was the Z3, which is now considered to have been the first 
        properly functioning computer in the world.  In order to make fast 
        progress the memory was also given a 64-word capacity, making use of 
        relays. </p>
      <p>The Z3&#39;s basic specifications were: </p>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>a binary number system </li>
          <li>floating point arithmetic </li>
          <li>22-bit word length, with 1 bit for the sign, 7 exponential bits and a 14-bit mantissa </li>
          <li>2,400 relays, 600 in the calculating and program section and 1,800 in the memory. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>The calculations possible were addition, subtraction, multiplication,
        and division, taking the square root, as well as some ancillary 
        functions.  Construction of the machine was interrupted in 1939 when I 
        was called up for military service.  It was typical of the attitude 
        prevalent in Germany at the time that I should be later released from 
        active service, not to develop computers, but as an aircraft engineer.  
        However, in my spare time, and with the help of friends, I was able to 
        complete the machine.  By 1941 it was working and I was able to show it 
        to the aircraft construction authorities.  The German Aircraft Research 
        Institute in Berlin-Adlershof showed greatest interest.  Professor 
        Teichmann, who had been working on the problem of wing flutter, was 
        particularly attracted.  Unlike aircraft stress, wing flutter results in
        critical instability due to vibration of the wings, sometimes in 
        conjunction with the tail unit.  Complex calculations were needed in 
        order to overcome this design problem.  The most difficult part was 
        calculating the so-called &#34;Küssner determinants&#34; based on complex 
        numbers and unknown quantities in the main diagonal.  I achieved a 
        breakthrough using my equipment for this calculation.  Unfortunately the
        Aircraft Research Institute had not been given a high enough priority 
        for me to be released from military service.  Only Professor Herbert 
        Wagner, who was working on the development of remote-controlled flying 
        bombs, and for whom I worked as a stress analyst, was in this enviable 
        position.  However, Wagner was very understanding, and helped as much as
        possible by allowing me to use some of my work time on the project.  By
        then I had already set up my own small engineering business, the 
  &#34;Zuse-Ingenieur-Büro&#34; in Berlin.  The Z3 was later destroyed after 
        bombing raids.  Because of its historic importance we rebuilt it 20 
        years later; a replica now stands in the Deutsches Museum in Munich.</p>
      <p>Around 1942 it was decided to build a more powerful, improved Z4.
        We thought that we would be able to have it ready within one, to 
        one-and-a-half years.  It was to have a mechanical memory with a 
        capacity of 1,024 words, several card readers and punches, and various 
        facilities to enable flexible programming (address translation, 
        conditional branching). </p>
      <p>Construction of the machine started well but it was not long 
        before the War imposed its delays.  In the end, construction was not 
        completed until the close of the War.  Procurement of staff and 
        materials became increasingly difficult, and around 1943 the Berlin 
        blitz began, with heavy bomber raids nearly every day.  Several times we
        had to move location with the machine.  During the last few weeks of 
        the War we found refuge in Göttingen.  The Z4 was the only model we were
        able to save, and this in the face of considerable difficulties.  On 
        the 28 April 1945 we were able to demonstrate the Z4 to Professors 
        Prandtl, Betz and Küssner.  But the Western and Eastern fronts were 
        drawing closer daily and nobody could say whether Göttingen would be 
        bombed or not, or whether the Z4 was safe there.  The Ministry of 
        Aviation ordered us to take the machine to the underground works in the 
        Harz.  It was there that we first learnt of the terrible conditions 
        under which the so-called reprisal weapons - the V1 and V2 - were being 
        built.  We refused to leave the machine there, and, with the help of 
        Wernher von Braun&#39;s staff, we managed to get hold of a truck to 
        transport it elsewhere.  And so the Z4 odyssey continued.  We then moved
        south, ending up in a small Alpine village called Hinterstein in the 
        Allgäu, where we were finally able to find a good place to store the 
        machine. </p>
