    <h1>Carmakers Will Give Your Location to Police Without a Warrant, Senators Say</h1>

Consumers have good reasons to want their data kept private, and on the surface, the auto industry is an ally on that front. But behind the curtain, the industry is reportedly playing fast and loose with customers&#39; data, selling it or reportedly even handing it over to police despite promising not to.</p><div data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"><p>Connected cars have been promised to bring about a variety of quality-of-life improvements, both to car ownership and our experiences on the road. They&#39;re touted as preventing theft, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/ford-ceo-explains-why-legacy-automakers-take-forever-to-issue-ota-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">streamlining service</a>, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/audis-connected-car-tech-aims-to-save-cyclists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improving road safety</a>, and <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/news-study-connected-car-data-can-fix-traffic-delays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smoothing out traffic</a>. But <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/think-your-smartphone-is-tracking-you-your-cars-doing-it-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the drawbacks are manifesting just as quickly</a>, in forms such as <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/20674/connected-cars-dont-necessarily-disconnect-previous-owners-when-resold" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy issues</a>, stealth recalls, and even <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/an-abused-wife-took-tesla-over-tracking-tech-she-lost-2023-12-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enabling stalking</a>. Consumers have other reasons to worry, too: <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/27648/teslas-new-car-insurance-service-will-actively-spy-on-you-adjust-rates-accordingly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insurers are pressing harder for vehicle data</a>, and privacy is only becoming more valuable in an increasingly authoritarian <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/ai-traffic-surveillance-can-link-your-driving-patterns-to-criminal-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surveillance state</a>. The federal government has expressed concern too, with the Biden administration asserting that allowing Chinese EVs to be sold in the U.S. <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/permanent-ban-on-chinese-evs-recommended-by-ohio-senator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poses national security risks</a>.</p></div><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"><div><div></div></div><span data-rawhtml="1">BYD King, a Chinese hybrid sedan. <em>BYD</em> </span></figure><p>The industry is aware of the nation&#39;s privacy concerns, which is why many automakers signed the Alliance for Automotive Innovation&#39;s <a href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/innovation/Automotive%20Privacy/Consumer_Privacy_Principlesfor_VehicleTechnologies_Services-03-21-19.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Consumer Privacy Protection Principles</a> in 2014. Signatories of this lobby group&#39;s document promised not to hand over location, biometric, or driving behavior data to third parties without driver approval—with some exceptions. One of said exceptions requires police to obtain a court order (or a warrant, a subcategory of court order) to obtain driver info. But now, eight automakers have reportedly admitted to Congress that they&#39;d go against their word when push comes to shove.</p><p><a href="https://www.autonews.com/regulation-safety/automakers-will-give-connected-car-data-police" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Automotive News</em></a> reports that Toyota, Subaru, Mazda, Nissan, Kia, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen have told Congress they would hand over drivers&#39; data if faced with a subpoena. There&#39;s a major difference between a subpoena and a court order according to the <a href="https://www.apaservices.org/practice/good-practice/subpoenas-depositions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">APA Practice Organization</a>, which says &#34;a subpoena is a lawyer&#39;s assertion that she/he is entitled to the requested information, while a court order determines that the lawyer is in fact entitled to it.&#34; In other words, a subpoena is a request for information; a court order is a judge or magistrate backing that request.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"><div><div></div></div><span data-rawhtml="1"><em>Chris Ryan via Getty Images</em> </span></figure><p>Acquiring location data through subpoena could be easily weaponized by a legal system under escalating scrutiny for its widespread <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/free-speech/the-sneaky-way-the-police-could-abuse-their-power-to-restrict-free-speech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abuse of power</a>. To at least two Senators though, it also constitutes deceptive marketing on automakers&#39; parts.</p><p>&#34;Automakers have not only kept consumers in the dark regarding their actual practices, but multiple companies misled consumers for over a decade by failing to honor the industry’s own voluntary privacy principles,&#34; Senators Ron Wyden and Ed Markey reportedly wrote to the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>&#34;Vehicle location data can be used to identify Americans who have traveled to seek an abortion in another state, attended protests, support groups for alcohol, drug, and other types of addiction, or identify those of particular faiths, as revealed through trips to places of worship.&#34;</p><div><p><img alt="Video thumbnail" loading="lazy" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2iZw_C0aN04/hqdefault.jpg?auto=webp&amp;optimize=high&amp;quality=70&amp;width=1440" sizes="640w" srcset="
