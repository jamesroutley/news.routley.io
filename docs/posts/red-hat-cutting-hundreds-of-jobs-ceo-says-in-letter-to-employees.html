									<p><strong>RALEIGH –</strong> <a href="http://redhat.com">Red Hat</a> is cutting hundreds of jobs in a series of layoffs, Chief Executive Officer Matt Hicks has told employees in an email.</p>
<p>A copy of the email was shared with WRAL News.</p>
<p>Red Hat has hundreds of employees based at its headquarters in downtown Raleigh and some 19,000 worldwide.</p>
			
<p>The software giant is owned by IBM, which recently announced the layoff of some 3,900 workers but that<a href="https://wraltechwire.com/2023/04/20/ibm-keeps-hiring-despite-layoffs-ceo-krishna-says-earnings-report-boosts-stock/"> count has climbed to 5,000</a>, according to Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna. He also noted that over the last several months IBM has hired around 7,000 people. IBM spinoff Kyndryl also has made layoffs recently.</p>
<p>The layoffs come after IBM reported last week that Red Hat quarterly revenues had increased 8%. However, that was far below recent performances. “Red Hat had been averaging at least a 15% revenue growth, every quarter since IBM purchased it in 2019,” <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4595235-ibm-red-hat-slowdown-puts-revenue-growth-jeopardy">noted financial news site Seeking Alpha.</a></p>

<p>Hicks was named CEO on Red Hat last July.</p>
<p>“We will reduce the associate base of Red Hat over the next few weeks,” Hicks wrote in the email. He said the layoffs would be “just under 4% in total.”</p>
<p>However, layoffs are off limits in some areas.</p>
<p>“We will not reduce roles directly selling to customers or building our products,” Hicks wrote.</p>
<p>“Notifications will begin today in some countries, and the process will continue through the end of Q2,” he added.</p>
<p>Severance packages for workers vary by country but Hicks said many affected by the cuts will receive include between three and six months pay, bonuses due for the first quarter and prorated for quarter two, and up to six months of career transition services.</p>
<p>Red Hat joins a growing list of tech employers who have cut jobs so far this year. Nearly 610 companies have slashed 173,880 jobs, according to <a href="http://layoffs.fyi">Layoffs.fyi,</a> a site focused on the tech sector.</p>
<p>According to Hicks, the job cuts were necessary for the Hatters’ collective future.</p>
<p>“At the core of this decision is the need to rebalance where we are investing to enable Red Hat’s future,” he said.</p>
