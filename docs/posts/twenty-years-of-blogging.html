    <h1>Twenty years of blogging</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>This blog has now been running for <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2003/05/06/why-start-a-weblog">20 years!</a></p>
<p>Twenty years... a significant chunk of a human&#39;s adult life; while so
many things in my life have changed since May 2003, the blog has remained a
constant companion. This milestone inspired me to do some archaeology using the
amazing <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a>. It didn&#39;t have the very
first post, but I dug up one from just a week or so later - <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2003/05/13/book-review-the-designers-guide-to-vhdl-by-p-ashenden">a book review</a>.
Here&#39;s how it looked on <a href="http://use.perl.org/~spur/journal/">http://use.perl.org/~spur/journal/</a> (this link is long
dead, of course) in May 2003:</p>
<p><img alt="How this blog looked twenty years ago" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2023/blog-twenty-years-ago.png"/></p><p>When I wrote an update at the <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2013/05/06/ten-years-of-blogging">10 year mark</a>, the blog
looked like this:</p>
<p><img alt="How this blog looked ten years ago" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2023/blog-ten-years-ago.png"/></p><p>The looks - along with the hosting and the software used to generate and run the
blog - changed in <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2014/blogging-setup-with-pelican/">September 2014</a>, and the
blog has had roughly the current format ever since.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made some adjustments to the infrastructure - comments outgrew their
usefulness and were <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/turning-off-blog-comments/">turned off in 2018</a>.
To further reduce dependencies on
third-party services and make the blog faster and more self-contained,
blog analytics were switched to use a lightweight self-hosted solution <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/using-goatcounter-for-blog-analytics/">earlier
this year</a>.
Some infrastructure changes and upgrades have been happening once in a while,
but these are completely transparent for readers. Otherwise, it&#39;s been going
pretty steady.</p>
<p>Downtime has been exceedingly rare, and the blog&#39;s serving of static HTML
proved to be robust and resilient to spikes - including <em>many</em> HN storms and
&#34;hug of death&#34; attempts. This is a great improvement from the previous
Wordpress-on-BlueHost approach, which struggled with uptime, especially in times
of load.</p>
<p>The blog has been averaging ~25 posts per year in the past 10 years, with
something like 100,000 monthly visits. The content has shifted with
my interests, from a focus on C++ and Python to more Go content with a mix of
Rust and other new technologies like WebAssembly.</p>
<p>As before, big thanks to all my dedicated readers. Reader feedback has always
been a highlight of the blogging experience. I have no intention of stopping,
but can this blog <em>really</em> reach its 30th birthday? Only the future will tell.</p>
