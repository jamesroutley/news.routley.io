    <h1>Dear Mr. Vice President, Please Take Off Your Apple Watch</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
              <h2><strong>An Open Letter To JD Vance From A Former CIA Officer On The Counterintelligence Risks Of Smartwatches</strong></h2>
<p>Mr. Vice President,</p>
<p>Congratulations on your ascendancy to the Vice President of the United States of America. While we are an apolitical platform, we wish you nothing but success, the country depends on you.  </p>
<p>In a recent picture of you onboard Air Force Two, we couldn&#39;t help but notice the Apple Watch on your left wrist. As a former CIA case officer who spent most of his adult life recruiting spies and stealing secrets, I feel implored to highlight some of the potential vulnerabilities of your smartwatch before suggesting a simple solution.</p>
<p><strong>As Vice President, you are now a priority intelligence collection target for the world&#39;s most capable bad actors, and the Apple Watch is an effective vector for potential exploitation</strong>. We do not doubt that hostile intelligence services are working around the clock to exploit (“hack”) your devices and would be genuinely surprised if they haven&#39;t already.</p>

<h6>The photograph in question, reportedly from 28 Jan 2025.</h6>
<p>To be clear, we are not anti-technology or troglodytes. We are big fans of Apple and believe the iPhone and iPad are two of the most consequential products of the last century. For most people, the Apple Watch is a great tool and offers significant lifestyle benefits: fitness tracking, optimizing communication, and sleep and health monitoring. But you are not like most people. You are one of the most powerful world leaders and thus a priority target for extremely capable hostile intelligence services, including Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea—all of which are considered Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).  </p>
<p>From an intelligence perspective, the Apple Watch offers unique data collection and access for exploitation and even manipulation. Of particular concern, the watch contains a microphone that when worn is capable of detecting and recording the user&#39;s conversations.</p>
<p><img alt="us army smartwatch apple watch counterintelligence warning" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0582/0291/4931/files/IMG_4733_600x600_81f2f8bd-6fe4-4817-bc37-d8378abdc991_600x600.webp?v=1738420836"/></p>
<p>As Vice President, nearly everything you say and do is of interest to foreign intelligence services (FIS). This includes not only strategic-level discussions with the President and National Security officials but also conversations with your wife, political donors, and college friends. While the Apple Watch has security features in place, you must operate under the assumption that it can be compromised and exploited.</p>
<p>Through a process called hot micing, the microphone can be remotely activated or set to passively collect audio without the wearer&#39;s knowledge. Additionally, the Apple Watch collects GPS location, movement, and biometric data including heart rate and sleep patterns, representing potential vulnerabilities for exploitation by bad actors. If the device is compromised, all of this data is available to a hostile intelligence service.   <br/></p>

<p>Further, the average iOS Apple operating system has an estimated 40-80 third-party applications installed. Many of these apps collect data and resell it to advertisers. If a product is free, you are the product. While in theory this data is anonymized, we have our doubts. Just ask your new Secret Service Director Sean Curran. According to an investigative report by the French newspaper <em>Le Monde</em>, data collected through the fitness app Strava was leveraged to identify 26 Secret Service agents as well as the locations of sensitive meetings.</p>

<p>As you are likely aware, connected devices are prohibited in Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF) and regardless of location, many of your conversations occur at this level or higher. In September 2024, the US Army issued a warning to Department of Defense (DOD) personnel on the counterintelligence (CI) risks of smartwatches with a social media campaign:</p>
<p>“<em>Smartwatches can transmit sensitive information. Don’t be an insider threat - Think before you use a smartwatch in the field or on deployment</em>.”</p>
<p>While state-sponsored hackers (APTs) are likely the greatest threat, it is important to understand that private companies allegedly also maintain this capability. In 2021, Apple reportedly sued Israeli cybersecurity firm NSO Group:</p>
<p>“<em>NSO Group creates sophisticated, state-sponsored surveillance technology that allows its highly targeted spyware to surveil its victims. These attacks are only aimed at a very small number of users, and they impact people across multiple platforms, including iOS and Android. Researchers and journalists have publicly documented a history of this spyware being abused to target journalists, activists, dissidents, academics, and government officials</em>.”</p>

<p>To be very clear, there is nothing inherently wrong with Apple products or the Apple Watch. In fact, we would say that they are probably one of the most secure, or least vulnerable, tech products on the market. That said, any device can be hacked.  </p>
<p>If you don’t believe us, we encourage you to reach out to your newly appointed Director of CIA John Ratcliffe and Director of National Security Agency (NSA) General Timothy D. Haugh for a demonstration of our capabilities. You will be amazed.</p>
<p>I am a firm believer that you should not highlight a problem without providing a solution. So here are three watches we would recommend, not only are they great tools backed by intriguing heritage, but they are also all completely safe from the prying eyes of foreign intelligence services.</p>
<h2><strong>Sangin Instruments Neptune</strong></h2>
<p><img alt="Sangin Instruments Neptune jd vance apple watch risks" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0582/0291/4931/files/Untitled_design_967_1024x1024.png?v=1738421163"/></p>
<p>We are told there is no such thing as a “former” Marine. Given your time serving in the Corps, we can’t help but think a watch <a rel="noopener" title="Sangin Instruments - The Marine Owned “Raider Rolex”" href="https://www.watchesofespionage.com/blogs/woe-dispatch/sangin-instruments-the-marine-owned-raider-rolex" target="_blank">described as “A Marine Raider Rolex”</a> would fit the bill. Founded by Jacob Servantes, a Marine Special Operations veteran, Sangin produces a range of capable tool watches informed by the founder’s military experience and appreciation of watches. The Neptune is on the more refined end of the brand’s spectrum, capable of 300 meters of water resistance while still looking elegant enough for White House wear.</p>
<h2><strong>Marathon 41mm Diver’s Automatic (GSAR)</strong></h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0582/0291/4931/files/Untitled_design_969_1024x1024.png?v=1738421280" alt="marine special operations raider marathon 41mm gsar automatic"/></p>
<p><strong></strong>Another brand with legitimate links to the Marine Corps is <a rel="noopener" title="Marathon, Watch Maker for the Modern Military" href="https://www.watchesofespionage.com/blogs/woe-dispatch/marathon-watch-maker-for-the-modern-military" target="_blank">Marathon, a Canadian brand that has seen its watches issued to numerous US Military units including Marine Force Reconnaissance</a>. For your purposes, we would recommend <a rel="noopener" title="Diving With The Marathon Search and Rescue" href="https://www.watchesofespionage.com/blogs/woe-dispatch/diving-with-the-marathon-sar" target="_blank">the automatic GSAR</a>, which is powered by a Swiss Sellita movement while still offering significant water resistance and tritium tubes for constant nighttime legibility. Besides, if President Trump really does make Canada the 51st state, this watch will be almost made in the USA (just kidding… kind of).</p>
<h2><strong>Breitling “White House” Aerospace</strong></h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0582/0291/4931/files/933584F9-4929-47F9-81B3-66827F6F27AE_1_600x600.jpg?v=1738421478" alt="Breitling “White House” Aerospace"/></p>
<p>Thus far, we’ve suggested commercially available watches, but why not take advantage of your new position just a little bit with a customized Breitling “unit watch” that is only available to White House staff? The so-called <a rel="noopener" title="The Watches Of The Trump Administration" href="https://www.watchesofespionage.com/blogs/woe-dispatch/president-trump-administration-watches-rolex-omega-2025" target="_blank">“White House” Breitling Aerospace</a> is a customized version of one of the brand’s most popular models from a military and intelligence perspective, offering a broad swath of digital timekeeping functions that will help to offset the Apple Watch loss without having potentially dangerous counterintelligence implications.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0582/0291/4931/files/0D7585C5-DFF7-4CB8-8E7D-0260D279996D_600x600.jpg?v=1737465049" alt="white house breitling aerospace jd vance"/></p>
<p>During the previous Trump administration, someone set up a program where White House employees could order a version of several models with the White House Seal on the dial as well as a special caseback engraving. As a note, we’re not calling you sketchy, but it’s important to know that <a rel="noopener" title="Sketchy Dudes Wear Breitling - We Don’t Make The Rules" href="https://www.watchesofespionage.com/blogs/woe-dispatch/sketchy-dudes-wear-breitling" target="_blank">Sketchy Dudes Wear Breitling</a>. We don’t make the rules.</p>
<h2><strong>It&#39;s Never Just a Watch</strong></h2>
<p>Whether you know it or not, as a US Marine, you are a member of the W.O.E. community. Given the gravity of your new role, a watch may seem like an insignificant nuisance. But decades from now when you move on in life, the watch you wear over the next four years will be a talisman of your service to this country and treasured by your grandchildren. Unless it&#39;s an Apple Watch, in that case, it will be in a landfill.</p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
