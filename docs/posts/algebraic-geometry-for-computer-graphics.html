    <h1>Algebraic Geometry for Computer Graphics</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

    <p>Computer graphicists model shapes with polynomials. Simple linear polynomials generate flat polygons; 
        higher order polynomials generate curved lines and surfaces. In order to develop algorithms for modeling and rendering such shapes we 
        must have an intimate understanding of how the coefficients of the polynomials relate to the geometric shapes they generate. 
        The answers to various geometric questions are expressed in terms of new polynomials built out of the coefficients 
        of the original polynomial. The problem is that, for fairly simple shapes, these new polynomials can get incredibly complicated. 
        For example, the condition that a cubic curve has a double point results in a test expression that is a 12<sup>th</sup> 
        order polynomial in the cubic’s coefficients, and this test expression has over 10000 terms! Fortunately there is a better way to 
        deal with this problem. The research I am doing builds on a graphical notation technique that was originally proposed 
        by Sylvester and Clifford over 100 years ago. I have been translating many of the results of classical algebraic geometry into this 
        notation. 
        This has led to a much better visualization of the relation between a polynomial’s shape and its coefficients and has produced new 
        algorithms for solving and factoring polynomials. 
        My ultimate goal is a new catalog of all the interesting algebraic relations between polynomial coefficients and their shape, describing 
        curves and surfaces of orders up to 4 or 5 in a way that their processing can be accurately computed by parallel processors such as 
        modern GPU’s.</p>
    <p>Algebraic Geometry as studied by Mathematicians often deals with very abstract and general issues that I admit that 
        I don’t completely understand myself. Instead, my talks will focus on that subset of Algebraic Geometry that I find most relevant to 
        computer graphics. They will only require a knowledge of simple linear algebra and homogeneous coordinates. I am still researching 
        some of the topics so the presentation will show open questions as well as answers.</p>

        Jim Blinn made his first computer generated pictures in 1968 while an undergraduate at the University of Michigan. From 1974 to 1977 
        he was a graduate student at the University of Utah where he did research in realistic rendering. The results of this research have 
        become standard techniques in today’s computer animation systems. They include realistic specular lighting models, bump mapping and 
        environment/reflection mapping. 
        In 1977 he received a Ph.D. and moved to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where he produced computer graphics animations for various 
        space missions to Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. These animations were shown on many news broadcasts as part of the press coverage of 
        the missions and were the first exposure to computer animation for many people in the industry today. Also at JPL he produced 
        animation for the PBS series COSMOS and 
        for the Annenberg/CPB funded project “The Mechanical Universe”, a 52 part telecourse to teach college level physics. During these 
        productions he developed several other standard computer graphics techniques including work in cloud simulation and a modeling 
        technique variously called blobbies or metaballs. From 1989 to 1995 he worked at Caltech producing animations to teach High School 
        mathematics for “Project Mathematics!” 
        From 1987 to 2007 he had a regular column called 
        <em>Jim Blinn’s Corner </em>in the IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications journal where he described mathematical techniques used 
        in computer graphics. These have been collected into three books. From 1995 to 2009 he worked at Microsoft Research as a Graphics 
        Fellow developing a new mathematical notation scheme that greatly simplifies the algebraic description and manipulation of curves and 
        surfaces. He is currently retired</p></div>
