    <h1>Original Pong did not have any code or even a microprocessor</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">This is a simulation of the 1972 Atari game Pong at a circuit level.  The original Pong did not have
any code or even a microprocessor.  It was a circuit,
implemented mostly using digital logic chips, with a few timers and other
analog components.

Thanks to whoever made this.  I just found a few issues with it.
The CLK input to the 7474 on page 2 should be HRESET, not CLK.  Pin 5 of the 555&#39;s on pages 5 and 6 should be connected
to the capacitor.  Also some of the nodes are inconsistently labeled.

Also see <a href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/papers/edwards2012reconstructing.pdf">Reconstructing Pong
on an FPGA</a> by Stephen A. Edwards, which describes everything about the Pong circuit in exhaustive detail.
This was an enormous help to me in understanding the schematic; huge thanks to him.
