    <h1>Sweden reports damage to Baltic Sea cable with Estonia</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sweden on Tuesday said that a Baltic Sea telecom cable running to Estonia was partially damaged around the same time as a <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/finland-pipeline-leak-likely-caused-by-external-activity/a-67058017">Finnish-Estonian pipeline</a> and cable earlier this month.</p>

<p>Sweden&#39;s Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin said it was unclear what caused the damage to the undersea cable that connects Sweden and Estonia.</p>

<p>&#34;It is not a total cable break. There is a partial damage on this cable,&#34; Bohlin said. &#34;We cannot assess what caused the damage. But what we can say is that this damage has happened at a similar time and in physical proximity ... to the damage that was previously reported to a gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland, and a telecommunications cable between Estonia and Finland.&#34;</p>

<p>The damage to the cable was sustained outside the territorial waters and Sweden&#39;s exclusive economic zone.</p>

<p>Bohlin said that the cable has continued to function since then.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/estonia/t-39241513">Estonia&#39;s</a> economy ministry said the damage to the Swedish-owned cable was in Estonian territory, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the island of Hiiumaa, the Baltic News Service reported.</p>

<p>Service was restored within a few days, the agency added.</p>

<h2>Sweden, Estonia, and Finland all investigating</h2>

<p>On October 8, Finland said that its coast guard had discovered &#34;clear damage&#34; on the Balticconnector natural gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia, which was shut down due to a leak.</p>

<p>The Finnish government later said that it may have been a deliberate act.</p><div><h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Baltic Sea mystery - Who blew up the Nord Stream pipelines?"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"></path></g></svg>Baltic Sea mystery - Who blew up the Nord Stream pipelines?</h2><video id="video-67049886" controls="" playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="67049886" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/67019380_605.webp" data-duration="28:36"><source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/inf/inf231010_12072_TatortOstsee_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"/><source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/inf/inf231010_12072_TatortOstsee_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video></div>

<p>On Tuesday, Sweden&#39;s Defense Minister Pal Jonson said that his country&#39;s police, military and coast guard were in touch with Estonian counterparts on the matter.</p>

<p>He said there also was increased vigilance in the Baltic Sea.</p>

<p>&#34;We see the issue of security for our critical infrastructure as a high priority, and take the current situation seriously,&#34; Jonson told reporters.</p>

<p>Europe and NATO are becoming more concerned over the susceptibility of critical infrastructure around and under the Baltic Sea.</p>

<p>Last week, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson spoke of a &#34;spaghetti of cables, wires&#34; on the Baltic seabed which &#34;is absolutely fundamental for data traffic.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;We live in a time where civilian infrastructure is also very threatened in this security environment,&#34; Kristersson said. &#34;It is also a very clear lesson from Ukraine, i.e., attacking infrastructure that is for energy supply, food supply, water supply.&#34;</p>
