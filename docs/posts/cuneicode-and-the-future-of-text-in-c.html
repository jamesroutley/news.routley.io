      <p>Following up from the last post, there is a lot more we need to cover. This was intended to be the post where we talk exclusively about benchmarks and numbers. But, I have unfortunately been perfectly taunted and status-locked <!--more-->, like a monster whose “aggro” was pulled by a tank. The reason, of course, is due to a few folks taking issue with my outright dismissal of the C and C++ APIs (and not showing them in the last post’s teaser benchmarks).</p>

<p>Therefore, this post will be squarely focused on cataloguing the C and C++ APIs in detail, and how to design ourselves away from those mistakes in C.</p>

<p>Part of this post will add to the table from <a href="https://thephd.dev/the-c-c++-rust-string-text-encoding-api-landscape">Part 1</a>, talking about <em>why</em> the API is trash (rather than just taking it for granted that industry professionals, hobbyists, and academic experts have already discovered how trash it is). I also unfortunately had to add it to the benchmarks we are doing (which means using it in anger). As a refresher, here’s where the table we created left off, with all of what we discovered (including errata from comments people sent in):</p>

<p>In this article, what we’re going to be doing is sizing up particularly the standard C and C++ interfaces, benchmarking all of the APIs in the table, and discussing in particular the various quirks and tradeoffs that come with doing things in this manner. We will also be showing off the C-based API that we have spent all this time leading up to, its own tradeoffs, and if it can tick all of the boxes like ztd.text does. The name of the C API is going to be cuneicode, a portmanteau of Cuneiform (one of the first writing systems) and Unicode (of Unicode Consortium fame).</p>

<p>First, we are going to thoroughly review why the C API is a failure API, and all the ways it precipitates the failures of the encoding conversions it was meant to cover (including the existing-at-the-time Big5-HKSCS case that it does not support).</p>

<p>Then, we will discuss the C++-specific APIs that exist outside of the C standard. This will include going beneath <code>std::wstring_convert</code>’s deprecated API, to find that powers the string conversions that it used to provide. In particular, we will discuss <code>std::codecvt&lt;ExternCharType, InternCharType, StateObject&gt;</code> and the various derived classes <code>std::codecvt(_utf8/_utf16/_utf8_utf16)</code>. We will also talk about how the C API’s most pertinent failure leaks into the C++ API, and how that pitfall is the primary reason why Windows, specific IBM platforms, lots of BSD platforms, and more cannot properly support UTF-16 or UTF-32 in its core C or C++ standard library offerings.</p>

<p>Finally, we will discuss ztd.cuneicode / cuneicode, a C library for doing encoding conversions that does not make exceedingly poor decisions in its interfaces.</p>



<p>Standard C’s primary deficiency is its constant clinging to and dependency upon the “multibyte” encoding and the “wide character” encoding. In the upcoming C23 draft, these have been clarified to be the <em>Literal Encoding</em> (for <code>&#34;foo&#34;</code> strings, at compile-time (“translation time”)), the <em>Wide Literal Encoding</em> (for <code>L&#34;foo&#34;</code> strings, at compile-time), <em>Execution Encoding</em> (for any <code>const char*</code>/<code>[const char*, size_t]</code> that goes into run time (“execution time”) function calls), and <em>Wide Execution Encoding</em> (for any <code>const wchar_t*</code>/<code>[const wchar_t*, size_t]</code> that goes into run time function calls). In particular, C relies on the Execution Encoding in order to go-between UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 or Wide Execution encodings. This is clear from the functions present in both the <code>&lt;wchar.h&gt;</code> headers and the <code>&lt;uchar.h&gt;</code> headers:</p>

<p>The naming pattern is “(prefix)(<code>s</code>?)(<code>r</code>)<code>to</code>(suffix)(<code>s</code>?)”, where <code>s</code> means “string” (bulk processing), <code>r</code>” means “restartable” (takes a state parameter so it a string can be re-processed by itself), and the core <code>to</code> which is just to signify that it goes to the prefix-identified encoding to the suffix-identified encoding. <code>mb</code> means “multibyte”, <code>wc</code> means “wide character”, and <code>c8/16/32</code> are “UTF-8/16/32”, respectively.</p>

<p>Those are the only functions available, and with it comes an enormous dirge of problems that go beyond the basic API design nitpicking of libraries like simdutf or encoding_rs/encoding_c. First and foremost, it does not include all the possible pairings of encodings that it already acknowledges it knows about. Secondly, it does not include full bulk transformations (except in the case of going between execution encoding and wide execution encoding). All in all, it’s an exceedingly disappointing offering, as shown by the tables below.</p>

<p>As with the other table, the “✅” is for that conversion sequence being supported, and the “❌” is for no support. As you can see from all the “❌” in the above table, we have effectively missed out on a ton of functionality needed to go to and from Unicode encodings. C <strong>only</strong> provides bulk conversion functions for the “mbs”/”wcs” series of functions, meaning you can kiss any SIMD or other bulk-processing optimizations goodbye for just about every other kind of conversion in C’s API, including any UTF-8/16/32 conversions. Also note that C23 and C++20/23 had additional burdens to fix:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>u&#34;&#34;</code> and <code>U&#34;&#34;</code> string literals did not have to be UTF-16 or UTF-32 encoded;</li>
  <li><code>c16</code> and <code>c32</code> did not have to actually mean UTF-16 or UTF-32 for the execution encoding;</li>
  <li>the C and C++ Committee believed that <code>mb</code> could be used as the “UTF-8” through the locale, which is why they left <code>c8rtomb</code> and <code>mbrtoc8</code> out of the picture entirely until it was fixed up in C23 by Tom Honermann.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are no longer problems thanks to C++’s Study Group 16, with papers from R.M. Fernandes, Tom Honermann, and myself. If you’ve <a href="https://thephd.dev/c-the-improvements-june-september-virtual-c-meeting#n2728---char16_t--char32_t-string-literals-shall-be-utf-16-and-utf-32">read my previous blog posts</a>, I went into detail about how the C and C++ implementations could simply define the standard macros <code>__STDC_UTF_32__</code> and <code>__STDC_UTF_16__</code> to <code>0</code>. That is, an implementation could give you a big fat middle finger with respect to what encoding was being used by the <code>mbrtoc16/32</code> functions, and also not tell you what is in the <code>u&#34;foo&#34;</code> and <code>U&#34;foo&#34;</code> string literals.</p>

<p>This was an allowance that we worked hard to nuke out of existence. It was imperative that we did not allow yet another escalation of <code>char16_t</code>/<code>char32_t</code> and friends ending up in the same horrible situation as <code>wchar_t</code> where it’s entirely platform (and possibly run time) dependent what encoding is used for those functions. As mentioned in the previously-linked blog post talking about C23 improvements, we were lucky that nobody was doing the “wrong” thing with it and always provided UTF-32 and UTF-16. This made it easy to hammer the behavior in all current and future revisions of C and C++. This, of course, does not answer why <code>wchar_t</code> is actually something to fear, and why we didn’t want <code>char16_t</code> and <code>char32_t</code> to become either of those.</p>

<p>So let’s talk about why <code>wchar_t</code> is literally The Devil.</p>

<h2 id="c-and-wchar_t">C and <code>wchar_t</code></h2>

<p>This is a clause that currently haunts C, and is — hopefully — on its way out the door for the C++ Standard in C++23 or C++26. But, the wording in the C Standard is pretty straight forward (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>wide character</p>

  <p>value representable by an object of type <code>wchar_t</code>, <strong>capable of representing any character in the current locale</strong></p>

  <p>— §3.7.3 Definitions, “wide character”, <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3054.pdf">N3054</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one definition means that if you have an input into <code>mbrtowc</code> that needs to output more than one (1) <code>wchar_t</code> for the desired output, there is no appreciable way to describe that in the standard C API. This is because there is no reserved return code for <code>mbrtowc</code> to describe needing to serialize a second <code>wchar_t</code> into the <code>wchar_t* restrict pwc</code>. Furthermore, despite being a pointer type, <code>pwc</code> expects only a single <code>wchar_t</code> to be output into it. Changing the definition in future standards to allow for 2 or more <code>wchar_t</code>’s to be written to <code>pwc</code> is a recipe for overwriting the stack for code that updates its standard library but does not re-compile the application to use a larger output buffer. Taking this kind of action would ultimately end up breaking applications in horrific ways (A.K.A, an <a href="https://thephd.dev/binary-banshees-digital-demons-abi-c-c++-help-me-god-please">ABI Break</a>), so it is fundamentally unfixable in Standard C.</p>

<p>This is why encodings like Big5-HKSCS cannot be used in Standard C. Despite libraries advertising support for them like glibc and its associated locale machinery, they return non-standard and unexpected values to cope with inputs that need to write out two UTF-32 code points for a single indivisible unit of input. Most applications absolutely cannot cope with these return values, and so they start just outputting straight up garbage values as they don’t know how to bank up the characters and perform reads anymore, let alone do writes. It’s doubly-fun when others get to see it in real-time, too:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>oh wow, even better: glibc goes absolutely fucking apeshit (returns <code>0</code> for each <code>mbrtowc()</code> after the initial one that eats 2 bytes; herein <code>wc</code> modified to write the resulting character)</p>

  <p><img src="https://thephd.dev/assets/img/2023/06/glibc-apeshit.png" alt="A screenshot of a terminal in the directory `~/code/voreutils`. It is executing the following bash commands, one after another, and displaying their output `printf &#39;\x88\x62\x88\x56\x48&#39; | LOCPATH=/tmp/loc LC_ALL=zh_TW.Big5-HKSCS out/cmd/wc -m`. It shows a newline-separated list of output code points in hexadecimal without an &#34;0x&#34; prefix and as 8 numbers, which read, sequentially, `000000ca`, `00000304`, `00000304`, `00000304`, `00000304`. On the next line it then says `5`, indicating there were 5 output code points. Further usage shows the input string to `printf` being steadily truncated, showing increasingly silly outputs, including repeated `00000304` that show the output is effectively a failure."/></p>

</blockquote>

<p>This same reasoning applies to distributions that attempt to use UTF-16 as their <code>wchar_t</code> encoding. Similar to how Big5-HKSCS requires two (2) UTF-32 code points for some inputs, large swaths of the UTF-16 encoded characters use a double code unit sequence. Despite platforms like e.g. Microsoft Windows having the demonstrated <strong>ability</strong> to produce <code>wchar_t</code> strings that are UTF-16 based, the standard library must explicitly be an encoding that is called “UCS-2”. If a string is input that requires 2 UTF-16 code units — a leading surrogate code unit and its trailing counterpart surrogate code unit — there is no expressible way to do this in C. All that happens is that, even if they recognize an input sequence that generates 2 UTF-16 <code>wchar_t</code> code units, it will get chopped in half and the library reports “yep, all good”. Microsoft is far from the only company in this boat: IBM cannot fix many of their machines, same as Oracle and a slew of others that are ABI-locked into UTF-16 because they tried to adopt Unicode 1.0 faster than everyone else and got screwed over by the Unicode Consortium’s crappy UCS-2 version 1.0 design.</p>

<p>This, of course, does not even address that <code>wchar_t</code> on specific platforms does not have to be either UTF-16 or UTF-32, and thanks to some weasel-wording in the C Standard it can be impossible to detect if even your string literals are appropriately UTF-32, let alone UTF-16. Specifically, the predefined macro <code>__STDC_ISO_10646__</code> can actually be turned off by a compiler because, as far as the C Committee is concerned, it is a reflection of a <strong>run time</strong> property (whether or not <code>mbrtowc</code> can handle UTF-32mor UTF-16, for example), which is decided by locale (yes, <code>wchar_t</code> can depend on locale, like it does on several IBM and *BSD-based machines). Thusly, as <code>__STDC_ISO_10646__</code> is a reflection of a run time property, it becomes technically impossible to define <strong>before</strong>-hand, at compile time, in the compiler.</p>

<p>So, the easiest answer — even if your compiler knows it encodes <code>L&#34;foo&#34;</code> strings as 32-bit <code>wchar_t</code> with UTF-32 code points — is to just advertise its value <code>0</code>. It’s 100% technically correct to do so, and that’s exactly what compilers like Clang do. GCC would be in a similar boat as well, but they cut a backdoor implementation deal with numerous platforms. A header called <code>stdc-predef.h</code> is looked up at the start of compilation and contains a definition determining whether <code>__STDC_ISO_10646__</code> may be considered UTF-32 for the platform and other such configuration parameters. If so, GCC sets it to 1. Clang doesn’t want to deal with <code>stdc-predef.h</code>, or lock in any of the GCC-specific ways of doing things in this avenue too much, so they just shrug their shoulders and set it to <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>I could not fix this problem exactly, myself. It was incredibly frustrating, but ultimately I did get <em>something</em> for a few implementations. In coordination with Corentin Jabot’s now-accepted <a href="https://wg21.link/p1885">P1885</a>, I provided named macro string literals or numeric identifiers to identify the encoding of a string literal<sup id="fnref:literal-identification-macros" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:literal-identification-macros" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This allows a person to identify (at least for GCC, Clang, and (now) MSVC) the encoding they use with some degree of reliability and accuracy. The mechanism through which I implemented this and suggested it is entirely compiler-dependent, so it’s not as if other frontends for C or C++ will do this. I hope they’ll follow through and not continue to leave their users out to dry. For C++26 and beyond, Corentin Jabot’s paper will be enough to solve things on the C++ side. C is still left in the dark, but that’s just how it is all the time anyways these days so it’s not like C developers will be any less sad than when they started.</p>

<h2 id="c-and-multibyte-const-char-encodings">C and “multibyte” <code>const char*</code> Encodings</h2>

<p>As mentioned briefly before, the C and C++ Committee believed that the Execution Encoding could just simply be made to be UTF-8. This was back when people still had faith in locales (an attitude still depressingly available in today’s ecosystem, but in a much more damaging and sinister form to be talked about later). In particular, there are no Unicode conversions except those that go through the opaque, implementation-defined Execution Encoding. For example, if you wanted to go from the Wide Execution Encoding (<code>const wchar_t*</code>) to UTF-8, you cannot simply convert directly from a <code>const wchar_t* wide_str</code> string — whatever encoding it may be — to UTF-8. You have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set up an intermediate <code>const char temp[MB_MAX_LEN];</code> temporary holder;</li>
  <li>call <code>wcrtomb(temp, *wide_str, …)</code>;</li>
  <li>feed the data from <code>temp</code> into <code>mbrtoc8(temp, …)</code>;</li>
  <li>loop over the <code>wide_str</code> string until you are out of input;</li>
  <li>loop over any leftover intermediate input and write it out; and,</li>
  <li>drain any leftover state-held data by checking <code>mbsinit(state)</code> (if using the <code>r</code>-based restartable functions).</li>
</ul>

<p>The first and most glaring problem is: what happens if the Execution Encoding is not Unicode? It’s an unfortunately frightfully common case, and as much as the Linux playboys love to shill for their platform and the “everything is UTF-8 by default” perspective, they’re not being honest with you or really anyone else on the globe. For example, on a freshly installed WSL Ubuntu LTS, with <code>sudo apt-get update</code> and <code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code> freshly run, when I write a C or C++ program to query what the locale is with <code>getlocale</code> and compile that program with Clang 15 with as advanced of a glibc/libstdc++ as I can get, this is what the printout reads:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>===</span> Encoding Names <span>===</span>
Literal Encoding: UTF-8
Wide Literal Encoding: UTF-32
Execution Encoding: ANSI_X3.4-1968
Wide Execution Encoding: UTF-32
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you look up what “ANSI_X3.4-1968” means, you’ll find that it’s the most obnoxious and fancy way to spell a particularly old encoding. That is to say, my default locale when I ask and use it in C or C++ — on my brand new Ubuntu 20.04 Focal LTS server, achieved from just pressing “ok” to all the setup options, installing build essentials, and then going out of my way to get the most advanced Clang I can and combine it with the most up-to-date glibc and libstdc++ I can —</p>

<p>is ASCII.</p>

<p>Not UTF-8. Not Latin-1!</p>

<h2 id="just-ascii">Just ASCII.</h2>

<p>Post-locale, “<code>const char*</code> is always UTF-8”, “UTF-8 is the only encoding you’ll need” world, eh? 🙄</p>

<p>Windows fares no better, pulling out the generic default locale associated with my typical location since the computer’s install. This means that if I decide today is a good day to transcode between UTF-16 and UTF-8 the “standard” way, everything that is not ASCII will simply be mangled, errored on, or destroyed. I have to <a href="https://github.com/soasis/cuneicode/commit/5e413c4c36b49d2202c861158ffa46619e9b60b5">adjust my tests</a> when I’m using code paths that go through standard C or C++ paths, because apparently “Hárold” is too hardcore for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and glibc to handle. I have long since had to teach not only myself, but others how to escape the non-UTF-8 hell on all kinds of machines. For a Windows example, someone sent me a screenshot of a bit of code whose comments looked very much like it was mojibake’d over Telegram:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.dev/assets/img/2023/06/telegram-bad-data.png" alt="A screenshot from telegram showing a C++ class definition that contains a series of comments with the text COMPLETELY mangled and unreadable, just a dozen of them line after line made of strange symbols and complete gibberish."/></p>

<p>Visual Studio was, of course, doing typical Microsoft-text-editor-based Visual Studio things here. It was clear what went down, so I gave them some advice:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.dev/assets/img/2023/06/telegram-advice.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a telegram conversation. The text is all from a person with a rat avatar, named &#34;Jö Brk&#34;: &#34;you&#39;re dealing with 1 of 2 encodings.&#34; &#34;1 - Windows 1251. Cyrillic [sic] encoding, used in Russia.&#34; &#34;2 - UTF-8&#34; &#34;It&#39;s treating it as the wrong encoding. Chances are you need to go to &#34;open file as&#34;, specifically, and ask it to open as UTF-8.&#34; &#34;If that doesn&#39;t work, try Windows 1251.&#34; &#34;When you&#39;re done with either, try re-saving the file as UTF-8, after you find the right encoding.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m putting money on it being Windows-1251&#34;."/></p>

<p>And, ‘lo and behold:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.dev/assets/img/2023/06/telegram-bingo.png" alt="A screenshot of a telegram conversation, continued after the first. From anonymous: &#34;1251 works&#34;. Response from Jö Brk: &#34;There ya go.&#34;"/></p>

<p>Of course, some questions arise. One might be “How did you know it was Windows 1251?”. The answer is that I spent a little bit of time in The Mines™ using alternative locales on my Windows machine — Japanese, Chinese, German, and Russian — and got to experience first-hand how things got pretty messed up by an overwhelming high programs. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg: Windows 1251 is the most persistent encoding for Cyrillic data into/out of Central &amp; Eastern Europe, as well as Far North Asia. There’s literally an entire Wiki that contains common text sequences and their Mojibake forms when incorrectly interpreted as other forms of encodings, and most Cyrillic users are so used to being fucked over by computing in general that they memorized the various UTF and locale-based mojibake results, able to read pure mangled text and translate that in-real-time to what it actually means in their head. (I can’t do that: I have to look stuff up.) It’s just absurdly common to be dealing with this:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Even the file name for the above embedded image had to be changed from <code>ólafur-tweet.png</code> to <code>waage-tweet.png</code>, because Ruby — when your Windows and Ruby is not “properly configured” (????) — will encounter that name from Jekyll, then proceed to absolutely both crap <strong>and</strong> piss the bed about it by trying to use the C standard-based <code>sysopen</code>/<code>rb_sysopen</code> on it. By default, that will use the locale-based file APIs on Windows, rather than utilizing the over 2-decade old <code>W</code>-based Windows APIs to open files. It’s extraordinary that despite some 20+ years of Unicode, almost every programming language, operating system, core library, or similar just straight up <strong>does not</strong> give a single damn about default Unicode support in any meaningful way! (Thank God at least Python tries to do something and gets pretty far with its myriad of approaches.)</p>

<p>There are other ways to transition your application to UTF-8 on Windows, even if you might receive Windows 1251 data or something else. Some folks achieve it by drilling Application Manifests into their executables. But that only works for applications; ztd.text and ztd.cuneicode are libraries. How the hell am I supposed to Unicode-poison an application that consumes my library? The real answer is that there is still no actual solution, and so I spend my time telling others about this crappy world when C and C++ programs inevitably destroy people’s data. But, there is one Nuclear Option you can deploy as a Windows <em>user</em>, just to get UTF-8 by-default as the default codepage for C and C++ applications:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.dev/assets/img/2023/06/windows-unicode-option.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Windows 10 Settings screen, showing a sequence of windows eventually leading to the hidden Region Settings so that the check box for &#34;Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support&#34; can be checked off."/></p>

<p>Yep, the option to turn on UTF-8 by default is buried <em>underneath</em> the new Settings screen, under the “additional clocks” Legacy Settings window on the first tab, into the “Region” Legacy Settings window on the <strong>second</strong> tab (“Administrative”), and then you need to click the “Change system locale” button, check a box, and reset your computer.</p>

<p>But sure, after you do all of that, you get to live in a post-locale world. 🙃</p>

<h2 id="and-it-gets-worse">And It Gets Worse</h2>

<p>Because of course it gets worse. The functions I listed previously all have an <code>r</code> in the middle of their names; this is an indicator that these functions take an <code>mbstate_t*</code> parameter. This means that the state used for the conversion sequence is not taken from its <em>alternative</em> location. The alternative location is, of course, implementation-defined when you are not using the <code>r</code>-styled functions.</p>

<p>This alternative <code>mbstate_t</code> object might be a static storage duration object maintained by the implementation. It may be <code>thread_local</code>, it may not, and whether or not it is thread safe there is still the distinct horribleness that it is an opaquely shared object. So even <strong>if</strong> the implementation makes it thread-safe and synchronizes access to it (kiss your performance good-bye!), if, at any point, someone uses the non-<code>r</code> versions of the above standard C functions, any subsequent non=<code>r</code> functions downstream of them have their state changed out from underneath them. Somehow, our systems programming language adopted scripting-language style behavior, where everything is connected to everything else is a jumble of hidden and/or global state, grabbing variables and functionality from wherever and just loading it up willy-nilly. This is, of course, dependable and rational behavior that can and will last for a long time and absolutely not cause severe problems down the road. It definitely won’t lead to <a href="https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/1e70e82baa91">ranting screeds</a><sup id="fnref:screed-ableism" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:screed-ableism" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> from developers who have to deal with it.</p>

<p>Of course, even using the <code>r</code> functions still leaves the need to go through the multibyte character set. Even if you pass in your own <code>mbstate_t</code> object, you still have to consult with the (global) locale. If at any point someone calls <code>setlocale(&#34;fck.U&#34;);</code> you become liable to deal with that change in further downstream function calls. Helpfully, the C standard manifests this as unspecified behavior, even if we are storing our own state in an <code>mbstate_t</code>! If one function call starts in one locale with one associated encoding, but ends up in another locale with a different associated encoding during the next function call, well. Eat shit, I guess! This is because <code>mbstate_t</code>, despite being the “state” parameter, is still beholden to the locale when the function call was made and the <code>mbstate_t</code> object is not meant to store any data about the locale for the function call! Most likely you end up with either hard crashes or strange, undecipherable output even for what was supposed to be a legal input sequences, because the locale has changed in a way that is invisible to both the function call and the shared state between function calls with <code>mbstate_t</code>.</p>

<p>So, even if you try your hardest, use the restartable functions, and track your data meticulously with <code>mbstate_t</code>, libraries in the stack that may set locale will blow up everyone downstream of them, and applications which set locale may end up putting their upstream dependencies in an untested state of flux that they are entirely unprepared for. Of course, nobody sees fit to address this: there’s no reasonable <code>locale_t</code> object that can be passed into any of these functions, no way of removing the shadowy specter of mutable global state from the core underlying functionality of our C libraries. You either use it and deal with getting punched in the face at seemingly random points in time, or you don’t and rewrite large swaths of your standard library distribution.</p>

<p>All in all, just one footgun after another when it comes to using Standard C in any remotely scalable fashion. It is not surprise that the advice for these functions about their use is “DO. NOT.”, which really inspires confidence that <em>this</em> is the base that every serious computation engine in the world builds on for their low-level systems programming. This, of course, leaves only the next contender to consider: standard C++.</p>



<p>When I originally discussed Standard C++, I approached it from its flagship API — <code>std::wstring_convert&lt;…&gt;</code> — and all the problems therein. But, there was a layer beneath that I had filed away as “trash”, but that could still be used to get around many of <code>std::wstring_convert&lt;…&gt;</code>’s glaring issue. For example, <code>wstring_convert::to_bytes</code> always returns a new <code>std::string</code>-alike by-value, meaning that there’s no room to pre-allocate or pre-reserve data (giving it the worst of the allocation penalty and any pessimistic growth sizing as the string is converted). It also always assumes that the “output” type is <code>char</code>-based, while the input type is <code>Elem</code>-based. Coupled with the by-value, allocated return types, it makes it impossible to save on space or time, or make it interoperable with a wide variety of containers (e.g., <code>TArray&lt;…&gt;</code> from Unreal Engine or <code>boost::static_vector</code>), requiring an additional copy to but it into something as simple as a <code>std::vector</code>.</p>

<p>But, it would be unfair to judge the higher-level — if trashy — convenience API when there is a lower-level one present in virtual-based <code>codecvt</code> classes. These are member functions, and so the public-facing API and the protected, derive-ready API are both shown below:</p>

<p>Now, this template is not supposed to be anything and everything, which is why it additionally has virtual functions on it. And, despite the poorness of the <code>std::wstring_convert&lt;…&gt;</code> APIs, we can immediately see the enormous benefits of the API here, even if it is a little verbose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it cares about having both a beginning and an end;</li>
  <li>it contains a third pointer-by-reference (rather than using a double-pointer) to allow someone to know where it stopped in its conversion sequences; and,</li>
  <li>it takes a <code>StateType</code>, allowing it to work over a wide variety of potential encodings.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an impressive and refreshing departure from the usual dreck, as far as the API is concerned. As an early adopter of <code>codecvt</code> and <code>wstring_convert</code>, however, I absolutely suffered its suboptimal API and the poor implementations, from Microsoft missing <code>wchar_t</code> specializations that caused <code>wstring_convert</code> to break until they fixed it, or MinGW’s patched library deciding today was a good day to always swap the bytes of the input string to produce Big Endian data no matter what parameters were used, it was always a slog and a struggle to get the API to do what it was supposed to do.</p>

<p>But the thought was there. You can see how this API could be the one that delivered C++ out of the “this is garbage nonsense” mines. Maybe, it could even be the API for C++ that would bring us all to the promised land over C. They even had classes prepared to do just that, committing to UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 while C was still struggling to get past “<code>char*</code> is always (sometimes) UTF-8, just use the multibyte encoding for that”:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>UTF-32 is supported by passing in <code>char32_t</code> as the <code>Elem</code> element type. The <code>codecvt</code> API was byte-oriented, meaning it was made for serialization. That meant it would do little-endian or big-endian serialization by default, and you had to pass in <code>std::codecvt_mode::little_endian</code> to get it to behave. Similarly, it sometimes would generate or consume byte order markers if you passed in <code>std::codecvt_mode::consume_header</code> or <code>std::codecvt_mode::generate_header</code> (but it <strong>only</strong> generates a header for UTF-16 or UTF-8, NOT for UTF-32 since UTF-32 was considered the “internal” character type for these and therefore not on the “serialization” side, which is what the “external” character type was designated for). It was a real shame that the implementations were fairly lackluster when it first came out because this sounds like (almost) everything you could want. By virtue of being a <code>virtual</code>-based interface, you could also add your own encodings to this, which therefore made it both compile-time and run-time extensible. Finally, it also contained error codes that went beyond just “yes the conversion worked” and “no it didn’t lol xd”, with the <code>std::codecvt_base::result</code> enumeration:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>result</span> <span>{</span> <span>ok</span><span>,</span>
	<span>partial</span><span>,</span>
	<span>error</span><span>,</span>
	<span>noconv</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>whose values mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>result::ok</code> — conversion was completed with no error;</li>
  <li><code>result::partial</code> — not all source characters were converted;</li>
  <li><code>result::error</code> — encountered an invalid character; and,</li>
  <li><code>result::noconv</code> — no conversion required, input and output types are the same.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is almost identical to <a href="https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/encoding_error.html">ztd.text’s <code>ztd::text::encoding_error</code></a> type, with the caveat that ztd.text also accounts for the “all source characters could be converted, but the write out was partial” while gluing the <code>result::noconv</code> into its version of <code>result::ok</code> instead. This small difference, however, does contribute in one problem. And that one problem does, eventually, fully cripple the API.</p>

<h2 id="the-1n-and-n1-rule">The “1:N” and “N:1” Rule</h2>

<p>Remember how this interface is tied to the idea of “internal” and “external” characters, and the normal “wide string” versus the internal “byte string”? This is where something sinister leaks into the API, by way of a condition imposed by the C++ standard. Despite managing to free itself from <code>wchar_t</code> issues by way of having an API that could allow for multiple input and multiple outputs, it reintroduces them by applying a new restriction focused exclusively on <code>basic_filebuf</code>-related containers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A <code>codecvt</code> facet that is used by <code>basic_­filebuf</code> (<a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/file.streams">[file.streams]</a>) shall have the property that if</p>

  <p><code>do_out(state, from, from_end, from_next, to, to_end, to_next)</code></p>

  <p>would return <code>ok</code>, where <code>from != from_­end</code>, then</p>

  <p><code>do_out(state, from, from + 1, from_next, to, to_end, to_next)</code></p>

  <p>shall also return <code>ok</code>, and that if</p>

  <p><code>do_in(state, from, from_end, from_next, to, to_end, to_next)</code></p>

  <p>would return <code>ok</code>, where <code>to != to_­end</code>, then</p>

  <p><code>do_in(state, from, from_end, from_next, to, to + 1, to_next)</code></p>

  <p>shall also return <code>ok</code>.<sup>252</sup></p>

  <p>— Draft C++ Standard, <a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/locale.codecvt#virtuals-4">§30.4.2.5.3 [locale.codecvt.virtuals] ¶4</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the footnote reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>252)</sup> Informally, this means that <code>basic_­filebuf</code> assumes that the mappings from internal to external characters is 1 to N: that a <code>codecvt</code> facet that is used by <code>basic_­filebuf</code> can translate characters one internal character at a time.</p>

  <p>— Draft C++ Standard, <a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/locale.codecvt#footnote-252">§30.4.2.5.3 [locale.codecvt.virtuals] ¶4 Footnote 252</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reality, what this means is that, when dealing with <code>basic_filebuf</code> as the thing sitting on top of the <code>do_in</code>/<code>do_out</code> conversions, you must be able to not only convert 1 element at a time, but also avoid returning <code>partial_conv</code> and just say “hey, chief, everything looks <code>ok</code> to me!”. This means that if someone, say, hands you an incomplete stream from inside the file, you’re supposed to be able to read only 1 byte of a 4-byte UTF-8 character, say “hey, this is a good, complete character — <code>return std::codecvt_mode::ok</code>!!”, and then let the file proceed even if it never provides you any other data.</p>

<p>It’s hard to find a proper reason for why this is allowed. If you are always allowed to feed in exactly 1 internal character, and it is always expected to form a complete “N” external/output characters, then insofar as <code>basic_filebuf</code> is concerned it’s allowed to completely mangle your data. This means that any encoding where it does not produce <code>1:N</code> data Were you writing to a file? Well, good luck with that. Network share? Ain’t that a shame! Manage to open a file descriptor for a pipe and it’s wrapped in a <code>basic_filebuf</code>? Sucks to be you! Everything good about the C++ APIs gets flushed right down the toilet, all because they wanted to support the — ostensibly weird-as-hell — requirement that you can read or write things exactly 1 character at a time. Wouldn’t you be surprised that some implementation, somewhere, used <strong>exactly</strong> one character internally as a buffer? And, if we were required to ask for more than that, it would be an ABI break to fix it? (If this is a surprise to you, you should go back and read <a href="https://thephd.dev/binary-banshees-digital-demons-abi-c-c++-help-me-god-please#stdpolymorphic_allocator">this specific section in this post about ABI breaks and how they ruin all of us</a>.)</p>

<p>Of course, they are not really supporting anything, because in order to avoid having to cache the return value from <code>in</code> or <code>out</code> on any derived <code>std::codecvt</code>-derived class, it just means you can be fed a completely bogus stream and it’s just considered… okay. That’s it. Nothing you or anyone else can do about such a situation: you get nothing but suffering on your plate for this one.</p>

<p>An increasingly nonsensical part of how this specification works is that there’s no real way for the <code>std::codecvt</code> class to know that it’s being called up-stream by a <code>std::basic_filebuf</code>, so either every derived <code>std::codecvt</code> object has to be okay with artificial truncation, or the developers of the <code>std::basic_filebuf</code> have to simply throw away error codes they are not interested in and ignore any incomplete / broken sequences. It seems like most standard libraries choose the latter, which results in, effectively, all encoding procedures for all files to be broken in the same way <code>wchar_t</code> is broken in C, but for literally every encoding type if they cannot figure out how to get their derived class or their using class and then figure out if they’re inside a <code>basic_filebuf</code> or not.</p>

<p>Even more bizarrely, because of the failures of the specification, <code>std::codecvt_utf16</code>/<code>std::codecvt_utf8</code> are, in general, meant to handle UCS-2 and not UTF-16<sup id="fnref:UCS-2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:UCS-2" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. (UCS-2 is the Unicode Specification v1.0 “wide character” set that handles 65535 code points maximum, which Unicode has already surpassed quite some time ago.) Nevertheless, most (all?) implementations seem to defy the standard, further making the class’s stated purpose in code a lot more worthless. There are also additional quirks that trigger undefined behavior when using this type for text-based or binary-based file writing. For example, under the deprecated <code>&lt;codecvt&gt;</code> description for <code>codecvt_utf16</code>, the standard says in a bullet point</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The multibyte sequences may be written only as a binary file. Attempting to write to a text file produces undefined behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which, I mean. … What? Seriously? My encoding things do not work well with my <em>text file writing</em>, the one place it’s supposed to be super useful in? Come on! At this point, there is simply an enduring horror that leads to a bleak — if not fully disturbed — fascination about the whole situation.</p>

<h2 id="fumbling-the-bag">Fumbling the Bag</h2>

<p>If it was not for all of these truly whack-a-doodle requirements, we would likely have no problems. But it’s too late: any API that uses virtual functions are calcified for <strong>eternity</strong>. Their interfaces and guarantees can never be changed, because changing and their dependents means breaking very strong binary guarantees made about usage and expectations. I was truly excited to see <code>std::codecvt</code>’s interface surpassed its menial <code>std::wstring_convert</code> counterpart in ways that actually made it a genuinely forward-thinking API. But. It ultimately ends up going in the trash like every other Standard API out there. So close,</p>

<p>yet so far!</p>

<p>The rest of the API is the usual lack of thought put into an API to optimize for speed cases. No way to pass <code>nullptr</code> as a marker to the <code>to/from_end</code> pointers to say “I genuinely don’t care, write like the wind”, though on certain standard library implementations you could probably just get away with it<sup id="fnref:nullptr-lying" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nullptr-lying" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. There’s also no way to just pass in <code>nullptr</code> for the entire <code>to_*</code> sets of pointers to say “I just want you to give me the count back”; and indeed, there’s no way to compute such a count with the triple-input-pointer, triple-output-pointer API. This is why the libiconv-style of pointer-to-pointer, pointer-to-size API ends up superior: it’s able to capture all use cases without presenting problematic internal API choices or external user use choices (even if libiconv itself does not live up to its API’s potential).</p>

<p>This is, ostensibly, a part of why the <code>std::wstring_convert</code> performance and class of APIs suck as well. They ultimately cannot perform a pre-count and then perform a reservation, after doing a basic <code>from_next - from</code> check to see if the input is large enough to justify doing a <code>.reserve(…)</code>/<code>.resize()</code> call before looping and <code>push_back</code>/<code>insert</code>-ing into the target string using the <code>.in</code> and <code>.out</code> APIs on <code>std::codecvt</code>. You just have to make an over-estimate on the size and pre-reserve, or don’t do that and just serialize into a temporary buffer before dumping into the output. This is the implementation choice that e.g. MSVC makes, doing some ~16 characters at a time before vomiting them into the target string in a loop until <code>std::codecvt::in/out</code> exhausts all the input. You can imagine that encoding up to 16 characters at-most in a loop for a string several megabytes long is going to be an enormous no-no for many performance use cases, so that tends to get in the way a little bit.</p>

<p>There is, of course, one other bit about the whole C++ API that once again comes to rear its ugly head in our faces.</p>

<h2 id="old-habits-die-hard">Old Habits Die Hard</h2>

<p>There is also another significant problem with the usage of <code>std::codecvt</code> for its job; it relies on a literal locale object / locale facet to get its job done. Spinning up a <code>std::codecvt</code> can be expensive due to its interaction with <code>std::locale</code> and the necessity of being attached to a locale. It is likely intended that these classes can be used standalone, without attaching it to the locale at all (as their destructors, unlike other locale-based facets) were made public and callable rather than hidden/private. This means they can be declared on the stack and used directly, at least.</p>

<p>This was noticeably bad, back when I was still using <code>std::codecvt</code> and <code>std::wstring_convert</code> myself in sol2. Creating a fresh object to do a conversion resulted in horrible performance characteristics for that convert-to-UTF-8 routine relying on standard library facilities. These days, I have been doing a hand-written, utterly naïve UTF-8 conversions, which has stupidly better performance characteristics simply because it’s not dragging along whatever baggage comes with locales, facets, <code>wstring_convert</code>, <code>codecvt</code>, and all of its ilk. Which is just so deeply and bewilderingly frustrating that I can get a thumbs up from users by just doing the most head-empty, braindead thing imaginable and its just <strong>so much better</strong> than the default actions that come with the standard library.</p>

<p>Constantly, we are annoyed in the Committee or entirely dismissive of game development programmers (and I am, too!) of many of their concerns. But it is ENTIRELY plausible to see how they can start writing off entire standard libraries when over and over again you can just do the world’s dumbest implementation of something and it kicks the standard library’s ass for inputs small and large. This does not extrapolate to other areas, but it only takes a handful of bad experiences — especially back 10 or 20 years ago when library implementations were <strong>so much worse</strong> — to convince someone not to waste their time investigating and benchmarking when it is so much easier on the time-financials tradeoff to just assume it is godawful trash and write something quick ‘n’ dirty that was going to perform better <em>anyways</em>.</p>

<p>What a time to be alive trying to ask people to use Standard C and C++, when they can throw a junior developer at a problem at get better performance and compilation times to do a very normal and standard thing like convert to UTF-8.</p>

<p>I certainly don’t endorse the attitude of taking 20 year old perceptions and applying them to vastly improved modern infrastructure that has demonstrably changed, but it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see how we ended up on this particular horizon of understanding.</p>



<p>C and C++ are now Officially Critiqued™ and hopefully I don’t have to have anyone crawl out of the woodwork to talk about X or Y thing again and how I’m not being fair enough by just calling it outright garbage. Now, all of us should thoroughly understand why it’s garbage and how unusable it is.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if these APIs are garbage, how do we build our own good one? Clearly, if I have all of this evidence and all of these opinions, assuredly I’ve been able to make a better API? So, let’s try to dig in on that. I already figured out the C++ API in ztd.text and written about it extensively, so let’s cook up ztd.cuneicode (or just cuneicode), from the ground up, with a good interface.</p>

<h2 id="a-wonderful-api">A Wonderful API</h2>

<p>For a C function, we need to have 4 capabilities, as outlined by the table above.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single conversions, to transcode one indivisible unit of information at a time.</li>
  <li>Bulk conversions, to transcode a large buffer as fast as possible (a speed optimization over single conversion with the same properties).</li>
  <li>Validation, to check whether an input is valid and can be converted to the output encoding (or where there an error would occur in the input if some part is invalid).</li>
  <li>Counting, to know how much output is needed (often with an indication of where an error would occur in the input, if the full input can’t be counted successfully).</li>
</ul>

<p>We also know from the ztd.text blog post and design documentation, as well as the analysis from the previous blog post and the above table, that we need to provide specific information for the given capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how much input was consumed (even in the case of an error);</li>
  <li>how much output was written (even in the case of an error);</li>
  <li>that “input read” should only include how much was <strong>successfully</strong> read (e.g., stops before the error happens and should not be a partial read);</li>
  <li>that “output written” should only include how much was <strong>successfully</strong> converted (e.g., points to just after the last successful serialization, and not any partial writes); and,</li>
  <li>that we may need additional state associated with a given encoding to handle it properly (any specific “shift sequences” or held-onto state; we’ll talk about this more thoroughly when demonstrating the new API).</li>
</ul>

<p>It turns out that there is already on C API that does most of what we want design-wise, even if its potential was not realized by the people who worked on it and standardized its interface in POSIX!</p>

<h2 id="borrowing-perfection">Borrowing Perfection</h2>

<p>This library has the perfect interface design and principles with — as is standard with most C APIs — the worst actual execution on said design. To review, let’s take a look at the libiconv conversion interface:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>size_t</span> <span>iconv</span><span>(</span>
	<span>iconv_t</span> <span>cd</span><span>,</span> <span>// any necessary custom information and state</span>
	<span>char</span> <span>**</span> <span>inbuf</span><span>,</span> <span>// an input buffer and how far we have progressed</span>
	<span>size_t</span> <span>*</span> <span>inbytesleft</span><span>,</span> <span>// the size of the input buffer and how much is left</span>
	<span>char</span> <span>**</span> <span>outbuf</span><span>,</span> <span>// an output buffer and how far we have progressed</span>
	<span>size_t</span> <span>*</span> <span>outbytesleft</span><span>);</span> <span>// the size of the output buffer and how much is left</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As stated in Part 1, while the libiconv library itself will fail to utilize the interface for the purposes we will list just below, we ourselves can adapt it to do these kinds of operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>normal output writing (<code>iconv(cd, inbuf, inbytesleft, outbuf, outbytesleft)</code>);</li>
  <li>unbounded output writing (<code>iconv(cd, inbuf, inbytesleft, outbuf, nullptr)</code>);</li>
  <li>output size counting (<code>iconv(cd, inbuf, inbytesleft, nullptr, outbytesleft)</code>); and,</li>
  <li>input validation (<code>iconv(cd, inbuf, inbytesleft, nullptr, nullptr)</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, what is missing most from this API is the “single” conversion handling. But, you can always create a bulk conversion by wrapping a one-off conversion, or create a one-off conversion by wrapping a bulk conversion (with severe performance implications either way). We’ll add that to the list of things to include when we hijack and re-do this API.</p>

<p>So, at least for a C-style API, we need 2 separate class of functions for one-off and bulk-conversion. In Standard C, they did this by having <code>mbrtowc</code> (without an <code>s</code> to signify the one-at-a-time conversion nature) and by having <code>mbsrtowcs</code> (with an <code>s</code> to signify a whole-string conversion). Finally, the last missing piece here is an “assume valid” conversion. We can achieve this by providing a flag or a boolean on the “state”; in the case of <code>iconv_t cd</code>, it would be done at the time when the <code>iconv_t cd</code> object is generated. For the Standard C APIs, it could be baked into the <code>mbstate_t</code> type (though they would likely never, because adding that might change how big the <code>struct</code> is, and thus destroy ABI).</p>

<p>With all of this in mind, we can start a conversion effort for all of the fixed conversions. When I say “fixed”, I mean conversions from a specific encoding to another, known before we compile. These will be meant to replace the C conversions of the same style such as <code>mbrtowc</code> or <code>c8rtomb</code>, and fill in the places they never did (including e.g. single vs. bulk conversions). Some of these known encodings will still be linked to runtime based encodings that are based on the locale. But, rather than using them and needing to praying to the heaven’s the internal Multibyte C Encoding is UTF-8 (like with the aforementioned <code>wcrtomb</code> -&gt; <code>mbrtoc8/16/32</code> style of conversions), we’ll just provide a direction conversion routine and cut out the <code>wchar_t</code> encoding/multibyte encoding middle man.</p>



<p>The function names here are going to be kind of gross, but they will be “idiomatic” standard C. We will be using the same established prefixes from the C Standard group of functions, with some slight modifications to the <code>mb</code> and <code>wc</code> ones to allow for sufficient differentiation from the existing standard ones. Plus, we will be adding a “namespace” (in C, that means just adding a prefix) of <code>cnc_</code> (for “cuneicode”), as well as adding the letter <code>n</code> to indicate that these are explicitly the “sized” functions (much like <code>strncpy</code> and friends) and that we are not dealing with null terminators at all in this API. Thusly, we end up with functions that look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Single conversion</span>
<span>cnc_XnrtoYn</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span><span>*</span> <span>p_destination_buffer_len</span><span>,</span>
	<span>CharY</span><span>**</span> <span>p_maybe_destination_buffer</span><span>,</span>
	<span>size_t</span><span>*</span> <span>p_source_buffer_len</span><span>,</span>
	<span>CharX</span><span>**</span> <span>p_source_buffer</span><span>,</span>
	<span>cnc_mcstate_t</span><span>*</span> <span>p_state</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Bulk conversion</span>
<span>cnc_XsnrtoYsn</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span><span>*</span> <span>p_destination_buffer_len</span><span>,</span>
	<span>CharY</span><span>**</span> <span>p_maybe_destination_buffer</span><span>,</span>
	<span>size_t</span><span>*</span> <span>p_source_buffer_len</span><span>,</span>
	<span>CharX</span><span>**</span> <span>p_source_buffer</span><span>,</span>
	<span>cnc_mcstate_t</span><span>*</span> <span>p_state</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As shown, the <code>s</code> indicates that we are processing as many elements as possible (historically, <code>s</code> would stand for <code>string</code> here). The tags that replace <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> in the function names, and their associated <code>CharX</code> and <code>CharY</code> types, are:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Tags</td>
      <td>Character Type</td>
      <td>Default Associated Encoding</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>mc</code></td>
      <td><code>char</code></td>
      <td>Execution (Locale) Encoding</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>mwc</code></td>
      <td><code>wchar_t</code></td>
      <td>Wide Execution (Locale) Encoding</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>c8</code></td>
      <td><code>char8_t</code>/<code>unsigned char</code></td>
      <td>UTF-8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>c16</code></td>
      <td><code>char16_t</code></td>
      <td>UTF-16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>c32</code></td>
      <td><code>char32_t</code></td>
      <td>UTF-32</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The optional encoding suffix is for the left-hand-side (from, <code>X</code>) encoding first, before the right-hand side (to, <code>Y</code>) encoding. If the encoding is the default associated encoding, then it can be left off. If it may be ambiguous which tag is referring to which optional encoding suffix, both encoding suffixes are provided. The reason we do not use <code>mb</code> or <code>wc</code> (like pre-existing C functions) is because those prefixes are tainted forever by API and ABI constraints in the C standard to refer to “bullshit multibyte encoding limited by a maximum output of <code>MB_MAX_LEN</code>”, and “can only ever output 1 value and is insufficient even if it is picked to be UTF-32”, respectively. The new name “<code>mc</code>” stands for “multi character”, and “<code>mwc</code>” stands for — you guessed it — “multi wide character”, to make it explicitly clear there’s multiple values that will be going into and coming out of these functions.</p>

<p>This means that if we want to convert from UTF-8 to UTF-16, bulk, the function to call is <code>cnc_c8snrtoc16sn(…)</code>. Similarly, converting from the Wide Execution Encoding to UTF-32 (non-bulk) would be <code>cnc_mwcnrtoc32n(…)</code>. There is, however, a caveat: at times, you may not be able to differentiate solely based on the encodings present, rather than the character type. In those cases, particularly for legacy encodings, the naming scheme is extended by adding an additional suffix directly specifying the encoding of one or both of the ends of the conversion. For example, a function that deliberate encodings from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode">Punycode</a> (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3492.txt">RFC</a>) to UTF-32 (non-bulk) would be spelled <code>cnc_mcnrtoc32n_punycode(…)</code> and use <code>char</code> for <code>CharX</code> and <code>char32_t</code> for <code>CharY</code>. A function to convert specifically from SHIFT-JIS to EUC-JP (in bulk) would be spelled <code>cnc_mcsnrtomcsn_shift_jis_euc_jp(…)</code> and use <code>char</code> for both <code>CharX</code> and <code>CharY</code>. Furthermore, since people like to use <code>char</code> for UTF-8 despite <a href="https://thephd.dev/ever-closer-c23-improvements#isspace-u8-%F0%9F%92%A3-0">associated troubles with <code>char</code>’s signedness</a>, a function converting from UTF-8 to UTF-16 in this style would be <code>cnc_mcsnrtoc16sn_utf8(…)</code>. The function that converts the execution encoding to <code>char</code>-based UTF-8 is <code>cnc_mcsnrtomcsn_exec_utf8(…)</code>.</p>

<p>The names are definitely a mouthful, but it covers all of the names we could need for any given encoding pair for the functions that are named at compile-time and do not go through a system similar to libiconv. Given this naming scheme, we can stamp out all the core functions between the 5 core encodings present on C and C++-based, locale-heavy systems (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, Execution Encoding, and Wide Execution Encoding), and have room for additional functions using specific names.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the matter of “conversions where the input is assumed good and valid”. In ztd.text, you get this from using the <a href="https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/error%20handlers/assume_valid_handler.html"><code>ztd::text::assume_valid_handler</code> error handler object and its associated type</a>. Because we do not have templates and we cannot provide type-based, compile-time polymorphism without literally writing a completely new function, <code>cnc_mcstate_t</code> has a <a href="https://ztdcuneicode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/mcstate_t.html#state-functions">function that will set its “assume valid” state</a>. The proper <code>= {}</code> init of <code>cnc_mcstate_t</code> will keep it off as normal. But you can set it explicitly using the function, which helps us cover the “input is valid” bit.</p>

<p>Given all of this, we can demonstrate a small usage of the API here:</p>

<p>Which (on a terminal that hasn’t lost its mind<sup id="fnref:lost-mind" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:lost-mind" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>) produces the following output:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, some readers may have a question about how the example is written. In particular…</p>

<h2 id="fwrite-huh"><code>fwrite</code>? Huh??</h2>

<p>The reason we always write out Unicode data using <code>fwrite</code> rather than <code>fprintf</code>/<code>printf</code> or similar is because on Microsoft Windows, the default assumption of input strings is that they have a locale encoding. In order to have that data reach specific kinds of terminals, certain terminal implementations on Windows will attempt to convert from what they suspect the encoding of the application’s strings are (e.g., from <code>%s</code>/<code>%*.s</code>) to the encoding of the terminal. In almost all cases, this assumption is wrong when you have a capable terminal (such as the new Windows Terminal, or the dozens of terminal emulators that run on Windows). The C Standard for <code>fprintf</code> and its <code>%s</code> modifier specifies no conversions, but it does not explicitly forbid them from doing this, either. They are also under no obligation to properly identify what the input encoding that goes into the terminal is either.</p>

<p>For example, even if I put UTF-8 data into <code>fprintf(&#34;%s&#34;, (const char*)u8&#34;🐈 meow 🐱&#34;);</code>, it can assume that the data I put in is not UTF-8 but, in fact, ISO 8859-1 or Mac Cyrillic or GBK. This is, of course, flagrantly wrong for our given example. But, it doesn’t matter: it will misinterpret that data as one kind of encoding and blindly encode it to whatever the internal Terminal encoding is (which is probably UTF-16 or some adjacent flavor thereof).</p>

<p>The result is that you will get a bunch of weird symbols or a bunch of empty cells in your terminal, leading to confused users and no Unicode-capable output. So, the cross-platform solution is to use <code>fwrite</code> specifically for data that we expect implementations like Microsoft will mangle on various terminal displays (such as in VSCode, Microsoft Terminal, or just plain ol’ <code>cmd.exe</code> that is updated enough and under the right settings). This bypasses any internal <code>%s</code> decoding that happens, and basically shoves the bytes as-is straight to the terminal. Given it is just a sequence of bytes going to the terminal, it will be decoded directly by the display functions of the terminal and the shown cells, at least for the new Windows Terminal, will show us UTF-8 output.</p>

<p>It’s not ideal and it makes the examples a lot less readable and tangible, but that is (unfortunately) how it is.</p>

<h2 id="nevertheless">Nevertheless!</h2>

<p>This manages to cover the <strong>canonical</strong> conversions between most of the known encodings that come out of the C standard:</p>

<p>Anything else has the special suffix added, but ultimately it is not incredibly satisfactory. After all, part of the wonderful magic of ztd.text and libogonek is the fact that — at compile-time — they could connect 2 encodings together. Now, there’s likely not a way to fully connect 2 encodings at compile-time in C without some of the most disgusting macros I would ever write being spawned from the deepest pits of hell. And, I would likely need an extension or two, like Blocks or Statement Expressions, to make it work out nicely so that it could be used everywhere a normal function call/expression is expected.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, not all is lost. I promised an interface that could <strong>automatically</strong> connect 2 disparate encodings, similar to how <a href="https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/conversions/transcode.html">ztd::text::transcode(…)</a> can give to the ability to <a href="https://thephd.dev/any-encoding-ever-ztd-text-unicode-cpp#let%E2%80%99s-implement-shift-jis">convert between a freshly-created Shift-JIS and UTF-8</a> without writing that specific conversion routine yourself. This is critical functionality, because it is the step beyond what Rust libraries like encoding_rs offer, and outstrips what libraries like simdutf, utf8cpp, or Standard C could ever offer. If we do it right, it can even outstrip libiconv, where there is a fixed set of encodings defined by the owner of the libiconv implementation that cannot be extended without recompiling the library and building in new routines. ICU includes functionality to connect two disparate encodings, but the library must be modified/recompiled to include new encoding routines, even if they have the <code>ucnv_ConvertEx</code> function that takes any 2 disparate encodings and transcodes through <code>UChar</code>s (UTF-16). Part of the promise of this article was that we could not only achieve maximum speed, but allow for an infinity of conversions <strong>within C</strong>.</p>

<p>So let’s build the C version of all of this.</p>

<h2 id="general-purpose-interconnected-conversions-require-genericity">General-Purpose Interconnected Conversions Require Genericity</h2>

<p>The collection of the cuneicode functions above are all all both strongly-typed and the encoding is known.In most cases (save for the internal execution and wide execution encodings, where things may be a bit ambiguous to an end-user (but not for the standard library vendor)), there is no need for any intermediate conversion steps. They do not need any potential intermediate storage because both ends of the transcoding operation are known. libiconv provides us with a good idea for what the input and output needs to look like, but having a generic pivot is a different matter. ICU and a few other libraries have an explicit pivot source; other libraries (like encoding_rs) want you to coordinate the conversion from the disparate encoding to UTF-8 or UTF-16 and then to the destination encoding yourself (and therefore provide your own UTF-8/16 pivot). Here’s how ICU does it in its <code>ucnv_convertEx</code> API:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>U_CAPI</span> <span>void</span> <span>ucnv_convertEx</span><span>(</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The buffers have to be type-erased, which means either providing <code>void*</code>, aliasing-capable<sup id="fnref:aliasing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:aliasing" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> <code>char*</code>, or aliasing-capable <code>unsigned char*</code>. (Aliasing is when a pointer to one type is used to look at the data of a fundamentally different type; only <code>char</code> and <code>unsigned char</code> can do that, and <code>std::byte</code> if C++ is on the table.) After we type-erase the buffers so that we can work on a “byte” level, we then need to develop what ICU calls <code>UConverter</code>s. Converters effectively handle converting between their desired representation (e.g., SHIFT-JIS or EUC-KR) and transport to a given neutral middle-ground encoding (such as UTF-32, UTF-16, or UTF-8). In the case of ICU, they convert to <code>UChar</code> objects, which are at-least 16-bit sized objects which can hold UTF-16 code units for UTF-16 encoded data. This becomes the Unicode-based anchor through which all communication happens, and why it is named the “pivot”.</p>

<h3 id="pivoting-getting-from-a-to-b-through-c">Pivoting: Getting from A to B, through C</h3>

<p>ICU is not the first library to come up with this. Featured in libiconv, <a href="https://github.com/libogonek/ogonek">libogonek</a>, my own libraries, encoding_rs (in the examples, but not the API itself), and more, libraries have been using this “pivoting” technique for coming up on a decade and a half now. It is effectively the same platonic ideal of “so long as there is a common, universal encoding that can handle the input data, we will make sure there is an encoding route from A to this ideal intermediate, and then go to B through said intermediate”. Let’s take a look at <code>ucnv_convertEx</code> from ICU again:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>U_CAPI</span> <span>void</span> <span>ucnv_convertEx</span> <span>(</span><span>UConverter</span> <span>*</span><span>targetCnv</span><span>,</span> <span>UConverter</span> <span>*</span><span>sourceCnv</span><span>,</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The pivot is typed as various levels of <code>UChar</code> pointers, where <code>UChar</code> is a stand-in for a type wide enough to hold 16 bits (like <code>uint_least16_t</code>). More specifically, the <code>UChar</code>-based pivot buffer is meant to be the place where <em>UTF-16 intermediate data is stored when there is no direct conversion between two encodings</em>. The iconv library has the same idea, except it does not expose the pivot buffer to you. Emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It provides support for the encodings…</p>

  <p>… [huuuuge list] …</p>

  <p>It can convert from any of these encodings to any other, <strong>through Unicode conversion.</strong></p>

  <p>— <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/">GNU version of libiconv</a>, May 21st, 2023</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, depending on what library you use, you can be dealing with a “pivot”, “substrate”, or “go-between” encoding that usually ends up being one of UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32. Occasionally, non-Unicode pivots can be used as well but they are exceedingly rare as they often do not accommodate characters from <strong>both</strong> sides of the equation, in a way that Unicode does (or gives room to). Still, just because somebody writes a few decades-old libraries and frameworks around it, doesn’t necessarily prove that pivots are the most useful technique. So, are pivots actually useful?</p>

<p>When I wrote my <a href="https://thephd.dev/any-encoding-ever-ztd-text-unicode-cpp#the-result">previous article about generic conversions</a>, we used the concept of a UTF-32-based pivot to convert between UTF-8 and Shift-JIS, without either encoding routine knowing about the other. Of course, because this is C and we do not have ugly templates, we cannot use the compile-time checking to make sure the <code>decode_one</code> of one “Lucky 7” object and the <code>encode_one</code> of the other “Lucky 7” object lines up. So, we instead need a system where encodings pairs identify themselves in some way, and then identify that as the pivot point. That is, for this diagram:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.dev/assets/img/2023/06/transcoding-path.png" alt="An image showing a sequence of conversions with three-quarter circle arrows showing a swirling progression through 4 different stops: &#34;Encoded Single Input&#34; ↪ &#34;Decode -&gt; Unicode Code Point&#34; ↪ &#34;Unicode Code Point -&gt; Encode&#34; ↪ &#34;Encoded Single Output&#34;"/></p>

<p>And make the slight modification that allows for this:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.dev/assets/img/2023/06/transcoding-path-better.png" alt="A modification of the previous image. It shows a sequence of conversions with three-quarter circle arrows showing a swirling progression through 4 different stops: &#34;Encoded Single Input&#34; ↪ &#34;Decode -&gt; {hastily blotched over text written over with {SOMETHING}}&#34; ↪ &#34;{hastily blotched over text written over with {SOMETHING}} -&gt; Encode&#34; ↪ &#34;Encoded Single Output&#34;"/></p>

<p>The “something” is our indirect encoding, and it will also be used as the pivot. Of course, we still can’t know what that pivot will be, so we will once again use a type-erased bucket of information for that. Ultimately, our final API for doing this will look like this:</p>

<p>The <code>_one</code> suffixed function does one-by-one conversions, and the other is for bulk conversions. We can see that the API shape here looks pretty much <strong>exactly</strong> like libiconv, with the extra addition of the <code>cnc_pivot_info</code> structure for the ability to control how much space is dedicated to the pivot. If <code>p_pivot_info-&gt;bytes</code> is a null pointer, or <code>p_pivot_info</code> is, itself, a null pointer, then it will just use some implementation-defined, internal buffer for a pivot. From this single function, we can spawn the entire batch of functionality we initially yearned for in libiconv. But, rather than force you to write <code>nullptr</code>/<code>NULL</code> in the exact-right spot of the <code>cnc_conv_pivot</code> function, we instead just provide you everything you need anyways:</p>

<p>It is mostly for convenience to provide these functions. Since the implementation is so simple, it warrants giving people exactly what they want. This is so they can have named functions which communicate what they’re doing in as normal a way, as opposed to using <code>NULL</code>/<code>nullptr</code> splattering that does not communicate anything to an external user why exactly someone is doing that with the function. Still, for as much as I talk these functions up, there’s two very important bits I’ve been sort of skirting around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How the <strong>heck</strong> do we get a <code>cnc_conversion*</code> handle?</li>
  <li>How do we make sure we provide <strong>generic</strong> connection points between random encodings?</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, strap in, because we are going to be crafting a reusable, general-purpose encoding library that allows for <strong>run time</strong> extension of the available encodings (without loss of speed).</p>



<p>As detailed in Part 1 and hinted at above, libiconv — and many other existing encoding infrastructures — do not provide a way to expand their encoding knowledge at run time. They ship with a fixed set of encodings, and you must either directly modify the library or directly edit data files in order to coax more encodings out of the interface. In the case of Standard C, sometimes that means injecting more files into the system locale files, or other brittle/non-portable things. We need a means of loading up and controlling a central place where we can stuff all our encodings. Not only that, but we also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>need to allow for controlling all allocations made; and,</li>
  <li>need to allow for loading up an encoding registry with any “defaults” the library may have ready for us.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, we need to come up with a new entity for the API that we will term a <code>cnc_conversion_registry</code>. As the name implies, it’s a place to store all of our conversions, and thusly a brief outline of the most important parts of the API should look like this:</p>

<p>This is a LOT to digest. So, we’re going to walk through it, from top-to-bottom. The first 5 are function type definitions: they define the 5 different core operations an allocator can perform. Following the order of the type definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>cnc_allocate_function</code>: an allocation function. Creates/acquires memory to write into. That memory can come from anywhere, so long as it contains as much as size was requested. It can give more space than requested (due to block size or for alignment purposes), and so the function takes the actual size as a pointer parameter to give it back to the end-user.</li>
  <li><code>cnc_reallocate_function</code>: a reallocation function. Takes an already-allocated block of memory and sees if it can potentially expand it in place or move it to another place (perhaps using memory relocation) with a larger size. Might result in a <code>memcpy</code> action to get the memory from one place to another place, or might do nothing and simply return <code>nullptr</code> while not doing anything to the original pointer. Tends to be used as an optimization, and may perhaps be a superset of the <code>cnc_allocation_expand_function</code>.</li>
  <li><code>cnc_allocation_expand_function</code>: an expansion function. This function takes an already-done allocation and attempts to expand it in-place. If it cannot succeed at expanding to the left (before) or right (after) of the memory section by the requested amounts, it will simply return <code>nullptr</code> and do nothing. Returns a new pointer by return value and files out the actual size by a <code>size_t</code> pointer value.</li>
  <li><code>cnc_allocation_shrink_function</code>: a shrinking function. This function takes an already-done allocation and attempts to shrink it in-place. It if cannot succeed at shrinking from the left (before) or right (after) of the memory section by the requested amounts, it will simply return <code>nullptr</code> and do nothing. Returns a new pointer by return value and files out the actual size by a <code>size_t</code> pointer value.</li>
  <li><code>cnc_deallocation_function</code>: a deallocation function. Releases previously-allocated memory.</li>
</ul>

<p>From there, we compose a heap that contains one of each of the above functions, plus a <code>void*</code> which acts as a user data that goes into the heap. The user data’s purpose is to provide any additional information that may be needed contextually by this heap to perform its job (for example, a pointer to an span of memory that is then used as a raw arena). 99% of people will ignore the existence of the heap, however, and just use either <code>cnc_create_default_heap</code>, or just call <code>cnc_new_registry</code> which will create a defaulted heap for you. (The default heap will just shill out to <code>malloc</code> and friends.) The defaulted heap is then passed to <code>cnc_open_registry</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s the registry options. Occasionally, it’s useful to create an entirely empty registry, so there’s a <code>cnc_registry_options_empty</code> for that, but otherwise the default is to stuff the registry with all of the pre-existing encodings that the library knows about. So, we can create a registry for this by doing:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cnc_conversion_registry</span><span>*</span> <span>registry</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>cnc_open_error</span> <span>reg_err</span>            <span>=</span> <span>cnc_new_registry</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>registry</span><span>,</span> <span>cnc_registry_options_default</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So far, the usage is surprisingly simple, despite all the stuff we talked about. The <code>cnc_conersion_registry</code> is a never-completed type, because it’s meant to just be a (strongly-typed) handle value (rather than just passing around a <code>void*</code>). The various error codes come from the <code>cnc_open_error</code> enumeration, and the names themselves explain pretty clearly what could happen. Some of the error codes don’t matter for this specific function, because it’s just opening the registry. The most we could run into is a <code>cnc_open_err_allocation_failure</code> or <code>cnc_open_err_invalid_parameter</code>; otherwise, we will just get <code>cnc_open_err_ok</code>! Assuming that we did, in fact, get <code>cnc_open_err_ok</code>, we can move on to the next part, which is opening/<code>new</code>ing up a <code>cnc_conversion*</code> from our freshly created <code>cnc_conversion_registry</code>.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-cuneicode-conversion">Creating a cuneicode Conversion</h2>

<p>Dealing with allocations can be a pretty difficult task. As with the <code>cnc_new_registry</code> function, we are going to provide a number of entry points that simply shill out to the heap passed in during registry creation so that, once again, 99% of users do not have to care where their memory comes from for these smaller objects. But, it’s still important to let users override such defaults and control the space: this is paramount to allow for a strictly-controlled embedded implementation that can compile and run the API we are presenting here. So, let’s get into the (thorny) rules of both creating a conversion object, and providing routines to give our <strong>own</strong> conversion routines. First, let’s start with creating a conversion object to use:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cnc_open_error</span> <span>cnc_conv_new</span><span>(</span><span>cnc_conversion_registry</span><span>*</span> <span>registry</span><span>,</span>

<p>As shown with the registry APIs, there’s 2 distinct variants: the <code>_open</code> and <code>_new</code> styles. The <code>_new</code> style pulls its memory from the heap passed in during registry creation. It’s the simplest and easiest and effectively runs with whatever is on the heap at the time. However, sometimes that’s not local-enough for some folks. Therefore, the <code>_open</code> variant of the functions ask for a pointer to a <code>size_t*</code> for the amount of space is available, and a <code>void* space</code> that points to an area of memory that contains at least <code>*p_available_space</code> bytes. Each set of APIs takes a <code>from</code> name and a <code>to</code> name: these are encoding names that are compared in a specific manner. That is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is basic ASCII Latin Alphabet (A-Z, a-z) case-insensitive;</li>
  <li>ASCII <code>_</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>.</code> (period), and ` ` (space) are considered identical to one another;</li>
  <li>and the input must be UTF-8.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason that the rules are like this is so <code>&#34;UTF-8&#34;</code> and <code>&#34;utf-8&#34;</code> and <code>&#34;utf_8&#34;</code> and <code>&#34;Utf-8&#34;</code> are all considered identical. This is different from Standard C and C++, where <code>setlocale</code> and <code>getlocale</code> are not required to do any sort of invariant-folding comparison and instead can consider  <code>&#34;C.UTF-8&#34;</code>, <code>&#34;C.Utf-8&#34;</code>, <code>&#34;c.utf-8&#34;</code> and similar name variations as completely different. That is, while one platform will affirm that <code>&#34;C.UTF-8&#34;</code> is a valid locale/encoding, another platform will reject this despite having the moral, spiritual, and semantic equivalent of <code>&#34;C.UTF-8&#34;</code> because you spelled it with lowercase letters rather than some POSIX-blessed “implementation-defined” nutjobbery. Perhaps in the future I could provide Unicode-based title casing/case folding, but at the moment 99% of encoding names are in mostly-ASCII identifiers. (It could be possible in the future to provide a suite of translated names for the <code>to</code> and <code>from</code> codes, but that is a bridge we can cross at a later date.)</p>

<p>The <code>_n</code> and non-<code>_n</code> style of functions are just variations on providing a size for the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> names; this makes it easy not to require allocation if you parse a name out of another format (e.g., passing in a validated sub-input that identifies the encoding from a buffer that contains an <code>&lt;?xml … ?&gt;</code> encoding tag in an XHTML file, or the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag). If you don’t call the <code>_n</code> functions, we do the C thing and call <code>strlren</code> on the input <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> buffers. (This is, obviously, a problem if the string is not <code>0</code>-terminated as is the case with directly accessing a region of memory inside of the raw loaded text that represents a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag or a <code>#pragma file_encoding &#34;kz1048&#34;</code>.) It’s not great, but momentum is momentum: C programmers and the APIs they use/sit beneath them on their systems expect footgun-y null terminated strings, no matter how many times literally everyone gets it wrong in their lifespan as a C or C++ programmer.</p>

<p>Now that we know all of this, we can start talking about <em>direct</em> matches and <em>indirect</em> matches and the <code>cnc_conversion_info</code> structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>cnc_conversion_info</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>const</span> <span>ztd_char8_t</span><span>*</span> <span>from_code_data</span><span>;</span>
	<span>size_t</span> <span>from_code_size</span><span>;</span>
	<span>const</span> <span>ztd_char8_t</span><span>*</span> <span>to_code_data</span><span>;</span>
	<span>size_t</span> <span>to_code_size</span><span>;</span>
	<span>bool</span> <span>is_indirect</span><span>;</span>
	<span>const</span> <span>ztd_char8_t</span><span>*</span> <span>indirect_code_data</span><span>;</span>
	<span>size_t</span> <span>indirect_code_size</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>cnc_conversion_info</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>(to|from)_code_(data/size)</code> fields should be self-explanatory: when the conversion from <code>from</code> to <code>to</code> is found, it hands the user the sized strings of the found conversions. These names should compare equal under the function <code>ztdc_is_encoding_name_equal_n_c8(…)</code> to the <code>from</code>/<code>to</code> code passed in to any of the <code>cnc_conv_new_*</code>/<code>cnc_conv_open_*</code> functions. Note it may not be identical (even if they are considered equivalent) as mentioned with the “normalizing” algorithm above. The names provided in the <code>cnc_conversion_info</code> structure are what is stored inside of the registry, and not the name provided to the function call.</p>

<p>The interesting bit is the <code>is_indirect</code> boolean value and the <code>indirect_code_(data/size)</code> fields. If <code>is_indirect</code> is true, then the <code>indirect_</code> fields will be populated with the name (and the size of the name) of the <strong>indirect encoding that is used as a pivot</strong> between the two encoding pairs!</p>

<h3 id="indirect-encoding-connection">Indirect Encoding Connection</h3>

<p>If we are going to have a way to connect two entirely disparate encodings through a common medium, then we need to be able to direct an encoding through an intermediate. This is where indirect conversions come in. The core idea is, thankfully, not complex, and works as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if there is an encoding conversion from “<code>from</code>” to “<code>{Something}</code>”;</li>
  <li>and, if there is an encoding from “<code>{Something}</code>” to “<code>to</code>”;</li>
  <li>then, a conversion entry will be created that internally connects <code>from</code> to <code>to</code> through <code>{Something}</code> as the general-purpose pivot.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, for a brief second, if we assumed we have an encoding conversion from an encoding called “<code>SHIFT-JIS</code>” to “<code>UTF-32</code>”, and we had an encoding from “<code>UTF-32</code>” to “<code>UTF-8</code>”, we could simply ask to go from “<code>Shift-JIS</code>” to “<code>UTF-8</code>” <strong>without</strong> explicitly writing that encoding conversion ourselves. Since cuneicode comes with an encoding conversion that does Shift-JIS ➡ UTF-32 and UTF-32 ➡ UTF-8, we can try out the following code ourselves and verify it works with the APIs we have been discussing up until now. This is the exact same example we had <a href="https://thephd.dev/any-encoding-ever-ztd-text-unicode-cpp#whew-alright-does-it-work">back in the C++ article</a>.</p>

<p>Step one is to open a registry:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;ztd/cuneicode.h&gt;
</span>
<span>#include &lt;ztd/idk/size.h&gt;
</span>
<span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>cnc_conversion_registry</span><span>*</span> <span>registry</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
	<span>{</span>
		<span>cnc_open_error</span> <span>err</span>
			<span>=</span> <span>cnc_registry_new</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>registry</span><span>,</span> <span>cnc_registry_options_empty</span><span>);</span>
		<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>cnc_open_err_ok</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>stderr</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;[error] could not open a new empty registry.&#34;</span><span>);</span>
			<span>return</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>

	<span>// …</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s the first step. If we fail to open a conversion registry, we return <code>2</code> out of main and bail. Otherwise, this gets us an entirely empty registry. Normally, we would use <code>cnc_registry_options_default</code> to have the registry filled with all of the existing conversions that exist in cuneicode added to the registry by-default, but we’re going to use the fact that its empty to test that there does not exist a conversion between the 2 encodings we want to work with. That test looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	<span>// …</span>

	<span>// Verify that no conversion exists</span>
	<span>// for Shift-JIS to UTF-8.</span>
	<span>{</span>
		<span>cnc_conversion</span><span>*</span> <span>conversion</span>          <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
		<span>cnc_conversion_info</span> <span>conversion_info</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>0</span> <span>};</span>
		<span>cnc_open_err</span> <span>err</span>                    <span>=</span> <span>cnc_conv_new</span><span>(</span>
			<span>registry</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;shift-jis&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;utf-8&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>conversion</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>conversion_info</span><span>);</span>
		<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>cnc_open_err_no_conversion_path</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>stderr</span><span>,</span>
				<span>&#34;[error] there should be no conversion path, but one exists&#34;</span><span>);</span>
			<span>cnc_registry_delete</span><span>(</span><span>registry</span><span>);</span>
			<span>return</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>

	<span>// …</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If this passes, we know we have a registry that does not have a conversion. Good. Now we can test if our idea of an indirect conversion is real. In order to do that, we’re going to need some APIs for adding conversions to the registry. There are a LOT and they are all <a href="">documented in the ztd.cuneicode documentation</a>; the ones we are going to focus on will be the <code>cnc_registry_add_single(…)</code> and <code>cnc_registry_add_alias(…)</code>, which look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>cnc_mcerr</span><span>(</span><span>cnc_conversion_function</span><span>)(</span><span>cnc_conversion</span><span>*</span> <span>conversion</span><span>,</span>

	<span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>original</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To start, there’s a somewhat complex function signature for <code>cnc_conversion_function</code>s. Most of those parameters should be recognizable from the <a href="#include-stddef-h-typedef-enum-cnc_mcerror-cnc_mcerror_ok-0-cnc_">previous definitions we talked about earlier</a>, with the addition of a single extra <code>void*</code> called <code>p_state</code>. This is an advanced parameter that we will not be talking about here, which is for managing state in a conversion and encoding-agnostic manner. Because Shift-JIS, UTF-32, and UTF-8 do not require state with the way our API is structured, we will not need to use it. We will also not need to touch the <code>*p_pivot_info</code> either, as we will not be attempting to use any sort of “temporary buffer space” (what the <code>p_pivot_info</code> is meant to control) in order to do the conversion. We will be using the static conversion functions that know which encodings they are going to, and which they are coming from, and we will know before hand that they do not need any state. That will make our implementation of the <code>cnc_conversion_function* single_conversion_function</code> very simple.</p>

<p>The last three parameters to <code>cnc_registry_add_single</code> are also advanced parameters that we will not be covering here. Because we have no state we are interested in, we can pass <code>NULL</code> for the <code>state_is_complete_fuinction</code>. Similarly, because there is no extra data or state we need to maintain inside the <code>cnc_conversion*</code> opaque handle, we will not need either an <code>open_function</code> or a <code>close_function</code> to describe the format of the memory that is contained within. Therefore, we will pass <code>NULL</code> and <code>NULL</code> to these parameters, too. The rest of the parameters — <code>registry</code>, <code>from</code>, and <code>to</code> — are straightforward manifestations of what we expect. We want the registry we are going to put the conversion into, the (null-terminated) name to register on the “<code>from</code>” side of the encoding, and the (null-terminated) name of the encoding on the “<code>to</code>” side.</p>

<p>The <code>cnc_registry_add_alias</code> function is meant to behave exactly as you expect: if someone asks for the name pointed to by <code>alias</code>, it will instead give them the name at <code>original</code>. This is to add common names to more descriptive encodings so that the usual existing names can map usefully on any given platform. Note that, like the APIs above, there are other versions such as <code>cnc_add_registry_single_n</code> and <code>cnc_registry_add_alias_n</code> so that counted strings can be used for the names as opposed to null-terminated strings, similar to the other APIs talked about above.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve established that, it’s time for the fun bit: writing a type-erased <code>cnc_conversion_function</code> that does a <strong>single indivisible unit of encoding work</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="single-conversions">“Single” Conversions</h3>

<p>As described in the last article, there is — in a generally-applicable, widely-applied way — a way to convert <a href="https://thephd.dev/the-c-c++-rust-string-text-encoding-api-landscape#bulk-conversions">between doing “bulk” work to make it do a “single” unit of work, and a way to stack a “single” unit of work to make it do “bulk” work</a>. The performance of these approaches is bloody <strong>AWFUL</strong>. But! It will work. This is why we are using <code>cnc_registry_add_single</code>: the name is a clue that we are going to only provide a function which does a single unit of indivisible work. Then, the API — automatically — is going to take that single function and then proceed to run it in a hard loop, over and over again, until it either errors or consumes all of the input data. “Consumes all of the input data” also includes any data accumulated on the state; this is what the <code>cnc_state_is_complete</code> function is for. Again, our encodings have no state, so we will just be providing <code>NULL</code> for the completion function and other related information to let them default internally, but that is its purpose.</p>

<p>So, we just have to implement the single conversion and the library will automatically take care of the rest for us, which is pretty nice! Going above the <code>main</code> function in the same file, we start with the following skeletons:</p>

<p>Nothing too complex, here. We are setting up a BUNCH of variables for us to use. Notably, we are trying to get strongly-typed pointers out of the existing byte-based ones, since internally we want to work with whole, complete code units and code points rather than going through everything byte-by-byte. As stated before, we are ignoring <code>state</code>, <code>conversion</code>, and <code>p_pivot_info</code>, since we know everything about the conversions we are going to do.</p>

<p>This is a lot of work to do a little, but it is, thankfully, very simple work that gets complicated by trying to be pedantically correct, the worst kind of correct. So:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In order to work internally, we need element counts and not byte counts. We convert to the right size by dividing by the size of the character.
    <ul>
      <li>(Yes, the <code>/ sizeof(char)</code> is redundant. It’s just for symmetry of the code, and it thankfully doesn’t hurt anyone but the worst, non-optimized C compilers.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If the pointer parameters are not null pointers, then we override the initialization in the last code snippet by setting it to a real value.
    <ul>
      <li>We use <code>ztd_char32_t</code> because, unfortunately, Mac OS is broken and does not implement <code>&lt;uchar.h&gt;</code> properly on its platforms, and is missing as <code>char32_t</code> definition in C mode.</li>
      <li>For the <code>ztd_char32_t*</code> pointer, we make sure it is aligned. This is because, technically, unaligned reads and writes are undefined behavior. <code>x86</code> and <code>x86_64</code> allows it, but e.g. PowerPC will either mangle the data or just straight up lie/crash with the data. Not fun to debug, so it’s asserted.</li>
      <li>Once we’re done asserting it, we set the pointer with <code>ZTD_ASSUME_ALIGNED</code>, which isn’t strictly necessary but since we already went through all this trouble why the hell not?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That covers all of the steps above. Again, a lot of noise just to be pedantic, but it never hurts to not lead anyone down the stray path, right? Now that we have our proper pointers and proper sizes, we get to do the hard part: converting between Shift-JIS and UTF-32. That part looks like this:</p>

<p>Yeah, of course I’m cheating! Do you really want to see me write a Shift-JIS converter in the middle of this function? Absolutely not: I did not convert these pointers to something usable just to ignore something I already implemented: we call into the static conversion function and go on about our day like normal creatures that have better things to do. The rest of the function is just converting back to byte sizes and byte pointers and having a good time:</p>

<p>You can imagine that the implementation for <code>utf32_to_utf8</code> uses much the same mechanisms: we convert to concrete pointers, assert that they are aligned, and then pass it into the pre-existing <code>cnc_mcntoc32n_utf8</code> function that cuneicode has. Again, it’s not a crash course in UTF-32 to UTF-8 conversion, but we’re always meant to work smarter, not harder, and I am not implementing these conversions for the eightieth time in my life just to score points on a technical writeup.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-main">Back to <code>main</code></h3>

<p>With that out of the way, we can get back to our <code>main</code> function, and start using these functions to do a type-erased conversion in for our encoding registry. Let’s add the 2 conversions to our registry now:</p>

<p>Very straightforward. We add the Shift-JIS to UTF-32, and then the UTF-32 to UTF-8 conversion routine. We want to be able to access Shift-JIS at standard X0208 by just using the name “Shift-JIS”, so we connect it using an alias:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	<span>// …</span>

<p>Past this point, we just need to actually create the conversion and attempt the actual work. We tested before that the conversion did NOT work, so now we will require that it does work (otherwise, we bail from <code>main</code> with the error code <code>7</code>):</p>

<p>As before, the <code>conversion_info</code> variable has been filled in at this point, so now we can use it to get information about what we opened up into the <code>cnc_conversion*</code> handle:</p>

<p>Executing the code up until this point, we’ll get something like:</p>

</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>which is what we were expecting. Right now, cuneicode only has a conversion routine between Shift-JIS ⬅➡ UTF-32, so it only has one “indirect” encoding to pick from. The rest of this code should look familiar to the example given above for the compile-time known encoding conversions, save for the fact that we are passing values through <code>unsigned char*</code> rather than any strongly-typed <code>const char*</code> or <code>char8_t*</code> types. That means we need to get the array sizes in bytes (not that it matters too much, since the input and output values are in <code>char</code> and <code>unsigned char</code> arrays):</p>

<p>A general-purpose pivoting mechanism that can choose an intermediate and allow us to transcode through it, that we created ourselves! That means we have covered most of what is inside of the table even when we use an encoding that is as obnoxious to write an implementation against such as Punycode. Of course, despite demonstrating it can go through an indirect/intermediate encoding, that does not necessarily prove that we can do that for <strong>any</strong> encoding we want. The algorithm inside of cuneicode prefers conversions to and from UTF-32, UTF-8, and UTF-16 before any other encoding, but after that it’s a random grab bag of whichever matching encoding pair is discovered first.</p>

<p>This can, of course, be a problem. You may want to bias the selection of the intermediate encoding one way or another; to solve this problem, we just have to add another function call that takes a “filtering”/”selecting” function.</p>

<h2 id="indirect-control-choosing-an-indirect-encoding">Indirect Control: Choosing an Indirect Encoding</h2>

<p>Because this is C, we just add some more prefixes/suffixes on to the existing collection of function names, so we end up with a variant of <code>cnc_conv_new</code> that is instead named <code>cnc_conv_new_select</code> and its friends:</p>

<p>A <code>cnc_indirect_selection_function</code> type effectively takes the <code>from</code> name, the <code>to</code> name, and the <code>indirect</code> name and passes them to a function that returns a <code>bool</code>. This allows a function to wait for e.g. a specific indirect name to select, or maybe will reject any conversion that features an indirect conversion at all (the indirect name will be a null pointer to signify that it’s a direct conversion). For example, here’s a function that will only allow direct conversions or Unicode-based go-betweens:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;ztd/cuneicode.h&gt;

<p>This function might come in handy to guarantee, for example, that there’s a maximum chance that 2 encodings could convert between each other. Typically, Unicode’s entire purpose is to enable going from one encoded set of text to another without any loss, whether through publicly available and assigned code points or through usage of the private use area. A user can further shrink this surface area by demanding that the go-between is something like UTF-8. This can come particularly in handy for UTF-EBCDIC which has many bit-level similarities with UTF-8 that can be used for optimization purposes as a go-between.</p>

<p>cuneicode itself, when a version of the <code>cnc_conv_(open|new)</code> is used, provides a function that simply just returns <code>true</code>. This is because cuneicode, internally, has special mechanisms that directly scans a subset of the list of <a href="https://ztdcuneicode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/known%20unicode%20encodings.html">known Unicode encodings</a> and checks them first. If there’s a conversion routine stored in the registry to or from for UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, it will select and prioritize those first before going on to let the function pick whatever happens to be the first one. The choice is unspecified and not stable between invocations of the <code>cnc_conv</code> creation functions, but that’s because I’m reserving the right to improve the storage of the conversion routines in the registry and thus might need to change the data structures and their iteration paths / qualities in the future.</p>



<p>We have an API that can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>statically convert between 2 encodings using information known at compile-time (through the naming scheme of the functions);</li>
  <li>run-time convert between 2 encodings with a known, explicitly provided pathway between them (cuneicode encoding registry); and,</li>
  <li>run-time convert between 2 encodings with a run-time discovered, and typically Unicode-preferred, pathway between them (by arbitrarily connecting two different encodings through an indirect encoding).</li>
</ul>

<p>This satisfies all our requirements, and has an API that can work on even the tiniest devices to-boot. (We did not go over the allocation-less API’s that are signified by the <code>_open</code> functions; this will be the subject of a deep-dive for a later blog post.) So, now it comes time to fill in our tables from the last blog post about the functionality. It should come as no surprise that we check all the boxes, because we <strong>built</strong> it to check all the boxes.</p>

<p>There’s more API surface that we have not covered in this code. For example, there’s functions that help do error handling (e.g. replacement characters with skipping bad input, among other things). However, because this is C, this creates a combinatoric explosion of API surface: there needs to be so, SO many functions to handle it. One of the ways to mitigate this would be to use a combination of macros with Statement Expressions and similar to do better. Unfortunately, statement expressions are non-standard. What we do instead is create some pretty disgusting abominations with macros… though! Even though they are disgusting abominations, it actually ends up working somewhat decently (for now):</p>

<p>I will not show the implementation of this, because quite frankly it’s downright <em>sinful</em>. It’s the kind of stuff I’d have to go to confession for, but… well. I’m not going to the pearly gates yet, so I won’t have to account for the things I’ve done. I am not supposed to feel bad for the code I have written, nor for the state of the world as it relates to text in C and C++ … And yet? If I can be honest with you, dear reader…</p>



<p>The sad reality is that I attempted to standardize at least a <a href="https://thephd.dev/_vendor/future_cxx/papers/C%20-%20Restartable%20and%20Non-Restartable%20Character%20Functions%20for%20Efficient%20Conversions.html">portion of this work</a> (not the generic indirect conversions and encoding registry part) in C, for C23. I failed. So even as I sit here, lamenting the state of the ecosystem, angry at glibc, perpetually pissed off about Windows’s <code>ucrt.dll</code>, angry at Standard C and Standard C++?</p>

<p>The reality is that I’m no better.</p>

<p>This was my responsibility to fix it, to see it through to the end. It was, in fact, the <strong>sole</strong> reason I came down to work on C in the first place. Becoming Project Editor, helping with <code>enum</code>s, doing <code>#embed</code>, fixing initialization with <code>= {}</code>, <code>typeof</code>, and so much more…. that was extra. Unplanned. Unicode conversion functions was the one thing I did plan. This is the one thing I had the most knowledge about, a solid game plan for. Numerous individuals pulled through for me, even submitted National Body comments on my behalf so this could be cleaned up in time.</p>

<p>I still didn’t make it happen.</p>

<p>It also had knock-on effects: without these functions, we also did <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3016.pdf">not get <code>u8</code>/<code>u16</code>/<code>u32</code> specifiers for the <code>fprintf</code> family of functions</a>. The conversions were hard to specify without the functions being there (again, because I did not succeed in my mission). So not only did I fail in my mission, but my failure became other people’s problems. Just my one thing I failed to do, and it kept on going. And going.</p>

<p>And going.</p>

<p>This means we miss a whole cycle; no Unicode functionality in C for another spin of the standardization wheel. And, because the C++ library imports all C functions <em>de-facto</em> and <em>de-jure</em>, C++ does not get it either. This only makes me shudder more, because the deadline for the next version of the C standard is not set in stone. Some are advocating we take another 10 years to roll out the next version of the C standard with more features. Another 10 years with no cross-platform printing mechanism. Another 10 years without even the static functions going between Unicode encodings and freeing people from their locale / wide locale-sensitive conversion functions. Another 10 years of functions which are non-threadsafe.</p>

<p>10 years of getting to watch the ecosystem continue to slide into hell, because I couldn’t get my words on a paper correct so I couldn’t put it in the magic sky document.</p>

<p>10 years of responsibility.</p>

<p>Ten. Years.</p>



<p>Well. Not everything can go perfect, right? But, there is more to discuss than my abject inability to get the job done for just static, Unicode-centric conversions in C. In particular, one of the things hinted at by <a href="https://thephd.dev/the-c-c++-rust-string-text-encoding-api-landscape">Part 1</a> was this interface — despite it doing things like updating the input/output pointers as well as the input/output sizes — could be fast. Now that we have both the static conversion sections and the registry for this C library, is it possible to be fast? Can we compete with the Big Dogs™ like ICU and encoding_rs for their conversion routines? Where does standard C and C++ fit on the scale? And, well, here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p>But we’ll discuss these benchmarks more… Next time. If you’ve stuck around to read this whole giant article, wow, nice job! Unlike me with my C papers, you did great! 🎊</p>

<p>Hopefully, it enriched you, even if only a little. 💚</p>
