    <h1>Why quantum entanglement doesn&#39;t allow faster-than-light communication (2016)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My colleague-in-blogging Ethan Siegel does a regular reader-request feature, and this week&#39;s edition drifts into my territory, answering a question about <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/04/30/ask-ethan-can-we-use-quantum-entanglement-to-communicate-faster-than-light/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/04/30/ask-ethan-can-we-use-quantum-entanglement-to-communicate-faster-than-light/" aria-label="using quantum entanglement for faster-than-light communication">using quantum entanglement for faster-than-light communication</a>. As I jokingly said on Twitter, Ethan&#39;s answer is pretty good for an astronomer, but there are bits of it I don&#39;t like. Not because he gives a wrong answer-- he correctly notes that it&#39;s not possible to use entangled particles to send messages faster than the speed of light-- but because there&#39;s a lot of subtle and complex stuff at work here. I&#39;ve <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/08/11/how-quantum-randomness-saves-relativity/#2a506baf2ce2" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/08/11/how-quantum-randomness-saves-relativity/#2a506baf2ce2" aria-label="written about this before">written about this before</a>, but it&#39;s useful to poke at this a little more because the phrasing I dislike ties into some fairly deep stuff.</p>

<p>The basic scenario for entanglement-based communication looks like this: two people, traditionally named &#34;Alice&#34; and &#34;Bob&#34; share a pair of particles that can each be measured in one of two quantum states, which we&#39;ll call &#34;0&#34; and &#34;1.&#34; These particles are prepared in an entangled state in which a measurement of the state of Alice&#39;s particle is correlated with the measured state of Bob&#39;s particle, no matter how far apart they are. That is, if Alice measures her particle in state 1 at precisely noon in Schenectady, she knows that Bob in Portland will also measure his particle to be in state 1, whether he&#39;s in Portland, Maine, Portland, Oregon, or Portland Station on one of the moons of Yavin.</p>
<p>This seems like a perfect mechanism for sending information over vast distances, as Ethan notes:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>So now to Olivier’s question: could we use this property — quantum entanglement — to <em>communicate</em> from a distant star system to our own? The answer to that is yes, if you consider making a measurement at a distant location a form of communication. But when you say communicate, typically you want to know something <em>about your destination</em>. You could, for example, keep an entangled particle in an indeterminate state, send it aboard a spacecraft bound for the nearest star, and tell it to look for signs of a rocky planet in that star’s habitable zone. If you see one, make a measurement that forces the particle you have to be in the +1 state, and if you don’t see one, make a measurement that forces the particle you have to be in the -1 state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems like a really obvious application, and in fact a bunch of people seized on this as a justification for ESP and various other schemes-- I recommend David Kaiser&#39;s <a href="http://www.hippiessavedphysics.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.hippiessavedphysics.com/" aria-label="How the Hippies Saved Physics"><em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.hippiessavedphysics.com/">How the Hippies Saved Physics</em></a> for the fascinating history of this whole business. And, in fact, if the situation described above were possible-- if you could measure a particle&#39;s state in a way that forced a particular outcome-- you could absolutely send information this way. But you can&#39;t do that.</p>
<fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"></fbs-ad>
<p>And this is the point where I don&#39;t quite agree with the way Ethan explains the situation. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>It’s a brilliant plan, but there’s a problem: entanglement only works if you ask a particle, “what state are you in?” If you force an entangled particle into a particular state, you <em>break the entanglement</em>, and the measurement you make on Earth is completely independent of the measurement at the distant star. If you had simply measured the distant particle to be +1 or -1, then your measurement, here on Earth, of either -1 or +1 (respectively) would give you information about the particle located light years away. But by <em>forcing</em> that distant particle to be +1 or -1, that means, no matter the outcome, your particle here on Earth has a 50/50 shot of being +1 or -1, with no bearing on the particle so many light years distant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a subtle shift here from the impossible operation that would allow FTL communication to a different sort of operation, and it deserves to be spelled out. That is, in the original statement, you &#34;make a measurement that forces the particle&#34; to be in a particular state, while in the second you &#34;force an entangled particle into a particular state&#34; which breaks the entanglement. Those are not the same thing, though-- one is a measurement, the other is a change of state followed by a measurement.</p>

<p>It helps to think about a concrete implementation of this to make the distinction clear. So, imagine Alice&#39;s particle is one of the trapped ions that people regularly use to do quantum information experiments, which can be in one of two internal states. If her particle starts in a superposition of equal parts &#34;0&#34; and &#34;1,&#34; how would she go about forcing a definite measurement outcome, let&#39;s say &#34;1&#34;?</p>
<p>The answer is to do an operation that we would describe in words as &#34;If you&#39;re in state 0, flip the state, otherwise leave it alone.&#34; For a trapped-ion system, this is done using lasers to drive a transition from state 0 to state 1 by way of a third state (the jargon term for this is a &#34;Raman transition&#34;). If you choose your states carefully, you can arrange it so that an atom in state 0 will absorb the laser and flip its state, but an atom in state 1 won&#39;t interact with the laser at all. This sort of selective absorption is how they distinguish between states 0 and 1 in real trapped-ion experiments (state 0 absorbs a laser photon then re-emits the light, and repeating this a few million times a second gives you a bright spot on a camera pointed at the trap holding the ion), and a two-particle variant of it is how you entangle ions in the first place (the operation is &#34;If Ion A is in state 1, flip the state of Ion B,&#34; and you give it an input state where B is definitely in state 0 and A is in a superposition of 0 and 1).</p>
<p>If Alice does this on her particle, it does not, in fact, affect the state of Bob&#39;s particle in any way-- it&#39;s still in an indeterminate state that&#39;s a mix of 0 and 1. It breaks the correlation between the measurement results, though-- Alice&#39;s particle is no longer in a superposition, but only in state 1, so when Bob eventually makes a measurement that randomly picks 0 or 1, it doesn&#39;t necessarily match Alice&#39;s measurement, which is guaranteed to be 1.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the &#34;breaking of entanglement&#34; Ethan describes is actually a slightly tricky thing to do, requiring a fairly specific operation to make it work. You will sometimes hear people assert that entanglement is fragile, and that <em>any</em> disturbance of one of the particles will mess things up, but that&#39;s not true. In fact, there are a huge number of things you can do to change the state of one of the two particles without destroying the entangled nature of the system, provided you keep track of what you did to it and adjust your final measurements accordingly. (I have a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2012/03/14/entanglement-is-not-that-magic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2012/03/14/entanglement-is-not-that-magic/" aria-label="blog post">blog post</a> and an <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.6186" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.6186" aria-label="arxiv preprint">arxiv preprint</a> discussing this in more detail...) The impossibility of keeping track of all the ways entangled states get shifted is crucial to (the way I think about) the process of &#34;decoherence&#34; that plays a key role in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2016/01/05/what-the-many-worlds-interpretation-of-quantum-physics-really-means/#71ae159531fc" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2016/01/05/what-the-many-worlds-interpretation-of-quantum-physics-really-means/#71ae159531fc" aria-label="(the way I think about) the &#34;Many-Worlds&#34; interpretation of quantum physics">(the way I think about) the &#34;Many-Worlds&#34; interpretation of quantum physics</a>, which is what I was hinting at when I said this gets into some deep stuff, though this post is already running long, so I won&#39;t try to explain here.</p>
<p>Crucially, though, this is not the sort of thing that people talk about doing when they talk about using entanglement for faster-than-light communication. What they want is a <em>measurement procedure that forces a particular outcome</em>. That is, they want Alice to use some woo-woo mystical process to ask her particle &#34;What is your state?&#34; and make it come out to be 1, thus instantaneously forcing Bob&#39;s particle into state 1 as well. If such a procedure existed, you could, in fact, exploit it to send messages (with disastrous consequences for causality); fortunately, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/08/11/how-quantum-randomness-saves-relativity/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/08/11/how-quantum-randomness-saves-relativity/" aria-label="God plays dice with the universe">God plays dice with the universe</a>, and the results of a quantum measurement are unavoidably random. Which means that while Alice and Bob end up with measurements that are perfectly correlated, no information passes between them. They can only see the correlation when they get back together and <em>compare</em> lists, and they have to do that at or below the speed of light.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that the version of entanglement-based communication Ethan describes is a particularly naive sort that even fringe physicists mostly reject. A more plausible scheme for actually doing this would be to use different measurement bases to send information. That is, rather than &#34;force the state to be 1 to send Bob a 1,&#34; Alice would ask two different questions of her particle. If she wants to send Bob a 1, she would make a measurement asking &#34;Are you in 0 or 1?,&#34; but if she wants to send a 0 she makes a measurement asking &#34;Are you in &#39;0+1&#39; or &#39;0-1&#39;?&#34; The latter operation puts Bob&#39;s particle into the corresponding state, which has a 50% chance of returning either 0 or 1 for his measurement. So all Bob has to do is measure that probability distribution for each particle-- if it&#39;s either 0 or 1 with 100% probability, he knows Alice is sending a 1, and if it&#39;s 50% of each, she&#39;s sending a 0.</p>
<p>That scheme doesn&#39;t work either, for a more subtle reason. The problem is that you can&#39;t determine a probability distribution from a single measurement of &#34;0&#34; or &#34;1,&#34; so Bob would need to make a lot of copies of the state of his particle in order to distinguish Alice&#39;s message. But there&#39;s a very deep result (that <a href="http://www.hippiessavedphysics.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.hippiessavedphysics.com/" aria-label="Kaiser&#39;s book">Kaiser&#39;s book</a> claims was directly inspired by these FTL communication schemes) known as the &#34;no-cloning theorem&#34; showing that this is impossible-- you can&#39;t make faithful copies of a quantum state unless you already know what it is. There&#39;s no way for Bob to unambiguously determine which measurement Alice made, so you&#39;re back in the scenario where Alice and Bob each have random strings of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s that only turn out to be perfectly correlated later on, when they get back together and compare. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/08/11/how-quantum-randomness-saves-relativity/#2a506baf2ce2" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/08/11/how-quantum-randomness-saves-relativity/#2a506baf2ce2" aria-label="Quantum randomness saves the day">Quantum randomness saves the day</a>.</p>
<p>So, as I said, the whole business is subtle and complicated. The end result is always the same, though: While it&#39;s one of the weirdest and coolest phenomena in physics, there is no way to use quantum entanglement to send messages faster than the speed of light.</p></div></div>
