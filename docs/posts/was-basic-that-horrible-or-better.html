<p>Edsger Dijkstra, a renowned computer scientist, famously made this last controversial statement in bullet-point list of inconvenient truths that he published in 1975. Dijkstra was known for his strong opinions on programming languages, and he believed that the simplicity and lack of structured programming principles in BASIC could hinder students from developing a strong foundation in programming.</p>



<p>If we dig into what reality caused this statement, which made me felt personally attacked at some point ;), to be born, it’s a pretty fascinating rabbit hole (as everything in computing is, if you stay curious). And to separate that personal feeling from facts, let me assure you that I will clearly separate facts from opinions in this kind of posts!</p>







<p>This Dijkstra’s opinion was so strong and caused so much offense, that today the Generative Pre-trained Transforms seem to associate him with enough hatred for the language to imagine quotes such as “Everything ws fine until BASIC entered the picture”, something he never actually said. </p>



<p>However, one could argue that the second quote is contradictory, as the language BASIC is itself, for the same reason, quite simple. That should make it a much better tool, allowing the programmer user to focus on the goal. Like modern crippled Golang ;-). Does it mean BASIC is <strong>too </strong>simple? Were all the popular alternatives better?</p>



<p>The statement was also just a bullet point in a bigger list of similarly negative declarations, such as “PL/I -“the fatal disease”– belongs more to the problem set than to the solution set.” (<a href="https://retrofun.pl/2023/05/09/some-art-and-history-for-you/">remember? PL/I was the language behind Multics, a project that – by failing to meet the schedule – gave us Unix</a>) or, much harder, “The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense.”.</p>



<ul>
<li>The 70s, when it made him so resentful</li>



<li>The 80s and 90s, when his statement made home computer users so resentful</li>



<li>BASIC today </li>
</ul>







<h2>The 70s</h2>



<p>The flavor of BASIC most likely criticized by Dijkstra is <strong>Dartmouth BASIC</strong>, the original (!) version of the BASIC programming language, from 1964. According to Wikipedia, it was designed by two professors at Dartmouth College, John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz. With the underlying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_Time_Sharing_System" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dartmouth Time Sharing System</a> (DTSS), it offered an interactive programming environment to all undergraduates as well as the larger university community.</p>



<p>It wasn’t the BASIC most older computer users worldwide know. In fact, it wasn’t even an interpreted language, but a compiled one! </p>

<p><strong>A note to the beginner</strong>:</p>



<p>While Dartmouth BASIC was a compiled language, it didn’t bring all the downsides of having the extra compilation step before execution — with many other compiled languages of the 80s on home computers, and if we had “only” one computer, and a single-tasking one, probably including the need to exit the compiler, load the program, see it fail, load back the compiler, load our files, fix the problem, compile again… all of this lengthening the update cycle significantly. Dartmouth did better. At any time, when the program was in memory, you could use <code>SAVE</code> to save it from being forgotten when you finish working with the computer, and <code>RUN</code> to compile and execute it right away. The <code>RUN</code> command is familiar to users of our later 8-bit home computer BASIC environments, in which it instructs the computer to start interpreting the code line by line. </p>



<p>Why would you not have an editor? It’s not that they didn’t exist, even documentation from languages from the 60s mentions a few text editors. The problem was that editors require resources, and for decades computer software really wanted to spare every kilobyte not needed, and leave it free for the user programs. Or games.</p>



<p>The first version of the language was extremely limited, compared to any later popular version of BASIC. The only supported keywords apart from math functions were: <code>LET</code>, <code>PRINT</code>, <code>END</code>, <code>FOR...NEXT</code>, <code>GOTO</code>, <code>GOSUB...RETURN</code>, <code>IF...THEN</code>, <code>DEF</code>, <code>READ</code>, <code>DATA</code>, <code>DIM</code>, and <code>REM</code>. This means very basic flow control, I/O, comments, and basic arrays. The last feature is not trivial, so it was one of the few features that made it more useful than assembly language. . Variable names were limited to a single letter or a letter followed by a digit (286 possible variable names), which made the programs much harder to read (by a human being), than they should be.</p>



<p>By 1975 the language reached its Sixth edition. User input was added, a number of math operators was there (along the lines of <code>ABS</code>, <code>LOG</code>, <code>RND</code>, <code>SIN</code>). Did it allow “normal” (longer) variable names? No trace of such feature. Did it allow full commands (statements) in <code>IF...THEN</code>? Also no! It was only a conditional <code>GOTO</code> statement, meaning you must have wrote it as <code>IF A&gt;0 100</code> where <code>100</code> is the line to execute if the condition is met.</p>



<p>I can see where the rage against the machine running BASIC was coming from when I consider the classical “guessing game” example (the computer picks a random number, and the user is supposed to guess the number, being given hints like “too large” or “too small”):</p>



<pre><code lang="basic">100 REM GUESSING GAME
110
120 PRINT &#34;GUESS THE NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100.&#34;
130
140 LET X = INT(100*RND(0)+1)
150 LET N = 0
160 PRINT &#34;YOUR GUESS&#34;;
170 INPUT G
180 LET N = N+1
190 IF G = X THEN 300
200 IF G &lt; X THEN 250
210 PRINT &#34;TOO LARGE, GUESS AGAIN&#34;
220 GOTO 160
230
250 PRINT &#34;TOO SMALL, GUESS AGAIN&#34;
260 GOTO 160
270
300 PRINT &#34;YOU GUESSED IT, IN&#34;; N; &#34;TRIES&#34;
310 PRINT &#34;ANOTHER GAME (YES = 1, NO = 0)&#34;;
320 INPUT A
330 IF A = 1 THEN 140
340 PRINT &#34;THANKS FOR PLAYING&#34;
350 END</code></pre>



<p>src: <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/commands.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/commands.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The example comes directly from Dartmouth College</a>. </p>



<p>As you see, there code looks braindead simple, with conditional jumps (<code>IF G = X THEN 300</code>) that require you to jump along, taking your focus with you, and that do not support <code>ELSE</code> statements (in this simple example, an <code>ELSE</code> is realized like in assembly – by omission and just continuing over. If you didn’t get the number right and make the jump in line <code>190</code>, the number you provided is either too small, in which case you jump from line <code>200</code> to line <code>250</code>, or you just follow along to line <code>210</code>, because after ruling out the numbers being equal and <code>G&lt;X</code>, the only other option left is <code>G&gt;X</code>.</p>



<p>All the code looks very flat compared to today’s standards. This is because most BASIC implementations not only in the 60s and 70s, but also some in the 80s and 90s, did not handle unexpected whitespace very well. You already know the reason why you don’t see indented blocks within <code>IF...THEN</code> blocks… there’s nothing to indent, if you can’t put commands in the <code>THEN</code> clause, and can’t use multiple ones even in the BASIC versions where you can. This is cheating, but let’s peek into 1982 and check out Commodore 64’s code:</p>



<pre><code lang="basic">10 PRINT&#34;HELLO, HOW OLD ARE YOU&#34;,
20 INPUT A
30 IF A &gt; 30 THEN
40  PRINT&#34;THAT&#39;S A GOOD AGE FOR A RETROFUN.PL VISITOR!&#34;
50 END</code></pre>



<p>What may happen if a 25-year-old user executes it is:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="940" height="154" src="https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/image-2.png?resize=940%2C154&amp;ssl=1" alt="RUN
HELLO, HOW OLD ARE YOU? 25
THAT&#39;S A GOOD AGE FOR A RETROFUN.PL VISITOR!" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/image-2.png?w=974&amp;ssl=1 974w, https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/image-2.png?resize=300%2C49&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/image-2.png?resize=768%2C126&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>While 25 is definitely a good age for a RetroFun.pl visitor, we can see that neither is the line <code>40</code> executing only if the condition <code>A&gt;30</code> is met, nor there’s any error that our <code>THEN</code> block was effectively empty either.  Having any code structure is going to be based on <code>GOTO</code>, <code>GOSUB</code> (that’s a <code>GOTO</code> that can <code>RETURN</code> to where it was called from) and more “flat” lines of code.</p>



<h3>One more elephant in the room</h3>



<p>There same source provides an example of how to plot a bell curve (amazingly simple to calculate in this math-heavy university-ready BASIC):</p>



<pre><code lang="basic">100 REM PLOT A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION CURVE
110
120 DEF FNN(X) = EXP(-(X^2/2))/SQR(2*3.14159265)
130
140 FOR X = -2 TO 2 STEP .1
150 LET Y = FNN(X)
160 LET Y = INT(100*Y)
170 FOR Z = 1 TO Y
180 PRINT &#34; &#34;;
190 NEXT Z
200 PRINT &#34;*&#34;
210 NEXT X
220 END</code></pre>



<p>You might have noticed, that the language doesn’t have any keywords making it easy to actually plot anything on the screen (as in: light up a pixel), and the example also kept it down to text mode.</p>



<p>But it’s not a missing feature of the language, or rather not a necessary but missing feature. If you asked about it, they would reply with…</p>



<p>What screen?</p>







<p>The elephant in the room is the computer the size of an elephant. Dartmouth BASIC was, like the system it worked on (DTSS), operated from remote terminals, which challenge even our todays definition of a lightweight terminal (you’d assume a simple device with a keyboard and a screen… oh, and lightweight), or a terminal as in the 80s. It’s essentially a heavy desk with a keyboard and a remotely-controlled typewriter (No, not a dot matrix printer). That’s where the “Teletype” name comes from. </p>

<h3>Competition (though also considered bad)</h3>



<p>Is it a programming language? Yes. Is it a nice one? No. Is it better than the competition? Well, Dijkstra in the same paper referred to PL/I, COBOL, Fortran, APL (a wonderful mix of praise and mockery: “<em>APL is a mistake, carried through to perfection. It is the language of</em> <em>the future for the programming techniques of the past: it creates a new generation</em> <em>of coding bums.</em>“), and FORTRAN (“hopelessly inadequate”).</p>



<p>By the way, if “PL” rings a “PL/SQL” bell for you, yes, there is some similarity between these two, but they are not the same language (the acronym represents different names too, “Programming Language” One vs “Procedural Language” in SQL).  Even a simple for loop is a bit different (see below). On the other hand, both languages use keywords like <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> instead of curly braces, which makes them more similar to each other, but also to Pascal or ADA (the last two are a separate new world we can explore).</p>



<pre><code>-- PL/SQL:
  FOR i IN 1..10 LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(i);
  END LOOP;</code></pre>



<pre><code>-- PL/I:
DO I = 1 TO 10;
  PUT SKIP LIST(I);  
END;</code></pre>



<p>Interestingly, a comparison of PL/I, COBOL and Fortran was published in December 1967 in the PL/I bulletin issue 5. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="940" height="464" src="https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/image.png?resize=940%2C464&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/image.png?resize=1024%2C505&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/image.png?resize=300%2C148&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/image.png?resize=768%2C379&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/image.png?resize=1536%2C757&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/image.png?w=1984&amp;ssl=1 1984w, https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/image.png?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>They compared the languages using good criteria – difficulty to learn, and difficulty to use, the latter measured by number of statement needed to achieve a particular goal, applicability in scientific and business cases. However due to the small publication size (a letter to a bulletin) the results are more quoted than presented, statistics for number of statement are given without the source codes. Unsurprisingly (it’s a PL/I bulletin after all), PL/I was considered superior in some, and at least just as good in other areas. It aimed to combine the best features of the other two. In reality it also had problems keeping up with their individual development, which may be the reason of its smaller adoption.</p>



<p>Some PL/I example code from the time can be found in the same issue (see PL/I bulletin archive), but the scan quality makes it hard to embed or quote in a post. However, I looked up an example from October 1976, from the compiler documentation, and, in my opinion, it shows how much more structure the code has had (note: indentation, complex if-else, procedures, procedure arguments, and the fact the arguments can have the same name as variables outside, shadowing them – not possible in BASIC at the time). By the way, keywords are case-insensitive.</p>



<pre><code lang="sql">A: PROCEDURE;
   DECLARE S CHARACTER (20);
   DCL SET ENTRY(FIXED DEClMAL(1))
   OUT ENTRY(LABEL);
   CALL SET (3);
E: GET LIST (S,M,N);
   B:  BEGIN;
       DECLARE X(M,N), Y(M);
       GET LIST (X,Y);
       CALL C(X,Y);
C:  PROCEDURE (P,Q);
         DECLARE P(*,*), Q(*),
              S BINARY FIXED EXTERNAL;
            S = 0;
            DO I = 1 TO M;
         IF SUM (P(I,*)) = Q(I)
               THEN GO TO B;
         S = S+1;
         IF S = 3 THEN CALL OUT (E);
         CALL D(1);
     B:  END;
         END C;
     D:  PROCEDURE (N);
           PUT LIST (&#39;ERROR IN ROW &#39;, N, &#39;TABLE NAME &#39;, S);
         END D;
     END B;
  GO TO E;
  END A;
OUT:  PROCEDURE (R);
      DECLARE R LABEL,
        (M,L) STATIC INTERNAL INITIAL (0),
        S BINARY FIXED EXTERNAL,
        Z FIXED DECIMAL(l);
      M M+l; S=O;
      IF M&lt;L THEN STOP; ELSE GO TO R;
SET:  ENTRY (Z);
      L=Z;
      RETURN;
      END OUT;</code></pre>



<p>The language spec from 1965 also documents supporting complex data structures (records), arrays, and arrays of structures. Page 65 defines:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A structure is a hierarchical collection of scalar variables, arrays, and structures. These need not be of the same data type nor have the same attributes.</p>
<cite>IBM Operating System/360, PL/I: Language Specifications (July, 1965)</cite></blockquote>



<p>None of this existed in BASIC for decades, and knowing this limitation and the atrocities it would cause a BASIC programmer to commit in their code, can definitely lead to thinking it ruins your chances of teaching yourself the right habits.</p>

<p>COBOL was somewhat similar. It was based on the Flow-Matic  data processing language designed by Grace Hooper. In 1950 Hopper became a Systems Engineer and Director of Automatic Programming Development of the UNIVAC Division. She had experience with, and continued her work on compilers, publishing her first paper on that topic in 1952. She then participated in the work to produce specifications for a common business language. Since Flow-Matic was the only existing business language at that time, it also served as the foundations for the specification of the language COBOL (COmmon Business-Oriented Language) which eventually came out in 1959. Her aim was that there should be international standardization of computer languages.</p>



<p>First version of COBOL was published in 1960, while the most recent one – in 2023.</p>



<p>Random thoughts from some COBOL fact-check:</p>



<ul>
<li>It’s old enough for the code style guide / format spec to consider punch cards, but that’s not the only option: “Your program can be punched on an off-line card punch or created with an on-line text editor.</li>



<li>The punch card format is the one that standardized 80 characters per line. Otherwise the examples mention 122 characters per line. Go check your <code>.editorconfig</code> </li>



<li>Reading COBOL’s manual is as nice, as reading today’s Linux man pages, format is similar as well.</li>
</ul>



<p>What could make it better than BASIC, and what could have made Dijkstra say it cripples the mind? </p>



<p>This situation improved as COBOL adopted more features. COBOL-74 added subprograms, giving programmers the ability to control the data each part of the program could access. It couldn’t save the name of the language associated with huge monolithic and unstructured spaghetti code, and falling behind in popularity. By 1985, there were twice as many books on FORTRAN and four times as many on BASIC as on COBOL in the Library of Congress.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShneiderman1985349-132">[wikipedia]</a></sup></p>



<p>Since this post shows code samples in all the languages, here’s a simple COBOL reference:</p>

<h3><span>Fortran</span> 70</h3>



<p>Another “bad language”, yet one of the biggest at the time, so still a BASIC competitor in the late 70s:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><span>Fortran</span> –“the infantile disorder”–, by <strong>now </strong>nearly 20 years old·, is hopelessly inadequate for whatever computer application you have in mind today: it is now too clumsy, too risky, and too expensive to use.</p>
<cite>Edsger Dijkstra, How do we tell truths that might hurt?</cite></blockquote>



<p>From a great distance, <span>Fortran</span> has some similarities to COBOL. It was important when it was created in 1957 by John Backus because it was the first widely recognized  (and probably second in history, after Speedcoding language from the same creator) more general, higher level language, replacing widespread use of direct assembly programming, which was extremely platform-specific (from the 50s to the 90s, there was a huge variety of CPU families and machine languages the computers “spoke” internally; we then settled on x86 for a while, driven by IBM PC adoption, and we’re diverging into x86 vs ARM today again).</p>

<p>While it wasn’t pretty, and relied on line prefixes just as hard as COBOL (with the <code>C</code> for <code>Comment</code>), it too provided the programmers with more structure, complex and nested conditional statements, <code>SUBROUTINE</code>, <code>FUNCTION</code> statements, </p>

<p>The syntax is slightly more reasonable when we, once again, see how much older the language is, and how much more paper the default code format was. </p>



<p>Looking at PL/I, FORTRAN and COBOL, however, we see that even the literally earliest programming languages in existence had more structural programming features than BASIC did (defining functions with own arguments, nested complex conditional statements). </p>



<p>To mention the choices that would be more obvious in the next decades: Niklaus Wirth designed Pascal in 1970. By the end of the decade it got significant popularity. Similar growth has been seen for C. </p>



<h2>The 80s/90s</h2>



<h3>What changed?</h3>



<p>Some years have passed, and technological progress began to made computers smaller (than the room they are in), and smaller, and affordable to more than just the government, universities, and biggest companies. The <strong>home computing</strong> revolution started. </p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/12261982-time.jpg?resize=600%2C750&amp;ssl=1" alt="In 1982, the man of the year goes to... the home computer!" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/12261982-time.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/12261982-time.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div>


<p>The Steves and Ronald Wayne soldered together their Apple computers in 1976, followed by insanely popular (in the US) Apple II in 1977. These had 4kB of RAM, a CPU running at 1 MHz, and were sold well under $1000. Apple I was at “affordable” $666 in 1976, bear in mind this would be $3600 in 2023 (via <a href="https://www.calculator.net/inflation-calculator.html?cstartingamount1=666&amp;cinmonth1=13&amp;cinyear1=1976&amp;coutmonth1=10&amp;coutyear1=2023&amp;calctype=1&amp;x=Calculate#uscpi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">inflation calculator</a>).</p>



<p>The 80s opened a sack of wonder and miracle: the TRS-80, Commodore VIC-20, and ZX-80 came out in 1980. ZX-81 improved on that in ’81. </p>



<p>This is when the home computers remembered most fondly, and that redefined the market for decades, started appearing, starting in 1982 and peaking around 1985: listing them in their 64kB/128kB pairs, they were Commodore 64/128, Atari 65/130XE, Amstrad CPC464/6128. Even the graphically mesmerizing MSX and Amiga 500 came out by 1985! You can see this is also where the sales slowed down (reasons for this are also a post-worthy material), and the IBM variant of “a personal computer” became “<strong>the</strong> personal computer”.</p>



<p>We don’t say “<em>personal</em> computer” today anymore, it’s just a <em>computer</em>. But this wasn’t always so simple. As you’ve seen the terminals, huge desks with an automated typewriter, connected to a multi-user time-sharing mainframe… computers were an academics supertool for the previous two-three decades. It wasn’t until the 80s that they appeared at many homes, and have users that are <strong>not</strong> scientists, engineers, or corporations.  </p>







<h3>John Smith writes his first program</h3>



<p>Ok, back to <strong>BASIC</strong>s! As you can see, this is where the possibility of computer programming appeared to regular people, to regular computer <em>users</em>. The average ZX Spectrum, Amstrad, Atari and Commodore, as long as they had a built-in keyboard, greeted the user with the <a href="https://retrofun.pl/2021/05/18/hobbyarding/" data-type="link" data-id="https://retrofun.pl/2021/05/18/hobbyarding/">amazing “READY” prompt of the BASIC language</a>, ready to be programmed within a second from powering up!</p>



<p>The needs for a programming language for the regular Jane Doe were a little different than for a scientist-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_(occupation)" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_(occupation)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">computer</a> from the 60s (it’s often said that we sent human to the Moon with a computer with less power than a modern calculator, but it were the women at NASA who were <em>the computers</em> that sent human to the Moon!)</p>



<p>The need for something easy to use, simple, less academic, and not crippling the mind 🙂 placed BASIC as topmost candidate. The language was also simple enough to be interpreted, thanks to having a limited number of keywords, and no structure/variable scope to track (all variables are global).</p>



<h4>The user experience</h4>



<p>It’s not even a “developer experience”, as the <a href="https://retrofun.pl/2021/05/18/hobbyarding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8-bits from the 80s booted straight into BASIC</a>, encouraging all users to begin their adventure with programming. </p>



<p>Many great programs can be created in BASIC – examples include .</p>



<p>The best proof of how much of the educational and fun value you can create in BASIC is the popularity of <strong>type-in</strong> programs and games in these decades. Having so many home computers readily booting into a simple programming language command line and interpreter made it possible to popularize simple coding. Computer magazines popular at the time, like Byte in the US and it’s smaller cousin Bajtek in Poland (we’d need to confirm this, but since “Bajtek” – pronounced <em>byte-æk</em> is – means a “cute little byte”, so it’s a perfect reference both to computing, and to the American magazine), printed so-called “type-in programs”, meaning you could literally type them in straight from the magazine into your computer, in reasonable time, and have some fun with it!</p>



<p>Some type-ins were utilities, like physics calculators or word counter for writers. Others were games. Here’s an example type-in game from 1982’s BYTE magazine:</p>

<p>Let’s add a mental note: a medium for transferring computer program? Paper.</p>



<p>In another Byte issue, June 1982, the magazine touches on an important topic – lack of standardization. Even though the works on the standard defining what the language  should provide started in 1970, only in 1983 a proposal appeared (<a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1983-02/page/n193/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Byte 02/1983</a>). </p>



<p>But <strong>how good was it</strong>, and <strong>how easy was BASIC to use to solve a problem?</strong></p>



<p>It was horrible. </p>



<p>Solving challenges from <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">day 1</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ikari-pl/advent-of-code-2023/blob/main/BBC-BASIC/01.bas">solution</a>) or <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">day 2</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ikari-pl/advent-of-code-2023/blob/main/BBC-BASIC/02.bas">solution</a>) was fun, even – or especially – when trying to be fairly memory efficient, and a little dirty on the approach. But then comes day 3, where we work with 140×140 matrix of characters. Some of them form numbers, some are symbols, everything else is filled with <code>.</code> as blank space.</p>



<p>Task one is to find all numbers that are adjacent to a symbol (next to it, above or below, or diagonally). This can be done, as one possible way, by loading into memory 3 lines at a time, and processing the middle one as the “current” one, and scrolling your way through the dataset without ever keeping more than 3 lines in memory. Then, keeping in mind the lack of more advanced string manipulation functions like “split”, “find” or “indexOf”, not to mention regular expressions, we can process such line character by character. If it’s a digit, we’re inside a number. Update the number digit by digit (<code>n=10*n+digit</code>), add to know numbers when we’re out of digits, and check for adjacency of a symbol.</p>



<p>It all sounds simple, if you can abstract your logic into functions, or some kind of smaller modules. But once the code grows a little bigger, and due to lack of memory, utilities, and all that stuff, you want to keep a few more flags for your happy little state machine, things get complicated. </p>



<h4>The determined coders</h4>



<p>These difficulties don’t mean sophisticated programs or games couldn’t be created for the computers in their native BASIC! The demo program of Amstrad CPC is written entirely in BASIC, except for the “Roland in Time” game fragment, showing off graphics, music, spreadsheet and word processing functions.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Amstrad CPC 464 Welcome Demonstration Cassette (&#34;Welcome To Amsoft&#34;)" width="940" height="705" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tKGA69brQyI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Amstrad CPC demo program is written 90% in BASIC (except from a game fragment shown)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Or checkout a more modern (2006) demo, but written entirely in Atari BASIC for Atari XL/XE (feel free to use 2x speed):</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="BACK TO BASICS - demo in Atari Basic for Atari XL/XE" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9d8yN6ds9s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>These demos feature something you haven’t seen before! <strong>Graphics</strong> (and sound)<strong>!</strong> Less or more advanced, but we see things in color, we see them animate, and in some cases we can also hear sounds and music. This would not have been possible in the dialects of BASIC designed to run remotely and print on a teletype. By moving the computer physically into the user’s room, the industry opened the door to multimedia and more dynamic entertainment.</p>



<h3>I’m an artist!</h3>



<p>Enabling interaction richer than text prompts and answers is more than just that technical difference, more than an item on the spec list.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Every language that makes it easy to create art, opens up your creativity, invites for experimentation, and gives you control and means of expression. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>And it did just that, two seconds away from toggling the POWER switch. Many examples, including type-ins, were combining mathematical functions and <code>PLOT</code> (draw a point) or <code>LINE</code> (draw a line) for surprising, mesmerizing artistic effects. Below is a (10x speedup) capture of <a href="http://www.atarimania.com/demo-atari-400-800-xl-xe-crystals_27841.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Crystals” demo written in Atari BASIC</a> on Atari XL/XE.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="336" height="224" src="https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/ezgif-3-c165edb6e1.gif?resize=336%2C224&amp;ssl=1" alt="Crystals demo (BASIC) on Atari XL/XE" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>These capabilities, allowing one to create procedural art on their own, are what I think the biggest advantage and the biggest impact of the BASIC language on average computer user. The full source code isn’t even big, see the full listing under the link below: </p>


<div><div><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="150" height="77" src="https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/CrystalsAtari.png?fit=150%2C77&amp;ssl=1" alt="fragment of source code of the Crystals program for Atari" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/CrystalsAtari.png?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/CrystalsAtari.png?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/retrofun.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/CrystalsAtari.png?resize=768%2C394&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"/></p></div></div>


<p>The magic of visual programming is what can be attractive to a non-nerd, and what introduced basic coding to masses in the 80s and 90s.</p>



<p>I have put this risky hypothesis in the posts title: that BASIC might have done something <em>better</em> than most languages. <strong>This is the thing better about BASIC</strong> – easy access to the computer’s fundamental graphical and musical capabilities. The commands were simple, yet the simplicity invited experimentation, and building upon them. Manuals for computers at that time also often taught you the math behind some shapes, explaining how and why a circle can be expressed as <code>(x, y) = r*sin(x),r*cos(y)</code>, and therefore how to draw it with a <code>LINE</code>. </p>



<p>Of course, modern and widely popular languages support all of that too (why would you remove something that works?), one of the closest examples in terms of simplicity and popularity would be JavaScript canvas. Sample code and effect on the left for JavaScript, right for BASIC:</p>



<div>
<pre><code lang="javascript">const canvas = document.getElementById(&#34;myCanvas&#34;);
const ctx = canvas.getContext(&#34;2d&#34;);

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(100, 75, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
ctx.stroke();</code></pre>



<pre><code lang="basic">ORIGIN 100,75:r=50
FOR i=0 TO 360:PLOT r*sin(i),r*cos(i):NEXT</code></pre>
</div>







<p>The BASIC example seems simpler, even though it doesn’t have a keyword/function for arcs or circles, and is a result of typing in the code on the right <em>directly after booting the 8-bit computer</em>.</p>



<p>Most languages will have many ways to paint things onto the screen, and there will be dozens of libraries to choose from – this is both for the better or worse. If the language doesn’t support something with the built-ins, it means both flexibility and the need to find the best tool for the job, a way to refer to it, possibly install or bundle with your program, and so on – these problems don’t exist if you work with a simple, but highly integrated environment. You could say BASIC helped to learn the basics. Once you master that, you usually want to move on to a more powerful toolkit no matter what the machine is.</p>







<h2>Today</h2>



<p>This gives us two aspects to look at “today” in:</p>



<ul>
<li>How is BASIC doing today? How are competitors doing? What other languages are the most popular? 🙂</li>



<li>What gives similar user experience today, but is more modern, easier to use, and just as fun? </li>
</ul>



<h3>The others are not dead yet</h3>



<p>Surprisingly, none of the languages mentioned previously for the 70s, 80s and 90s is dead.</p>



<ul>
<li>PL/I is still supported and maintained by, as it always has been, IBM. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj2_Ov1pJSDAxW4kO4BHQ8-AQAQFnoECBQQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Fdocs%2FSSY2V3_5.3.0%2Fcom.ibm.ent.pl1.zos.doc%2Fmg.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2n92-YOYAtl5tkRZ6ko8Iy&amp;cshid=1702741395615624&amp;opi=89978449">Here’s a PL/I manual from 2019</a>.</li>

<li>APL is more a curiosity – a language where a valid statement may look like <code>{↑1 ⍵∨.∧3 4=+/,¯1 0 1∘.⊖¯1 0 1∘.⌽⊂⍵}</code> is not easily adopted, and gets the hearts of hobbyists and mathematicians more than the average programmers.</li>
</ul>



<p>The top 10 programming languages have changed since the 70s (or 80s). According to IEEE, the top 10 of 2023 are: Python, Java, C++, C, JavaScript, C#, SQL, Go, TypeScript, and… HTML (huh? the name literally says it’s a Markup Language). For now, let’s just note the presence of C (started from 1972 but not officially published until 1978, so Dijkstra could not rant on it).
Visual Basic ended up on place 24th, noting MS decided not to develop the language further in 2020.
Fortran is still there, on place 27th, COBOL on 34th, and Ada on 36th.
Last, but not least, Pascal/Delphi is mentioned on place 45th. 

Revised Text:
The top 10 programming languages have changed since the 70s (or 80s). According to IEEE’s ranking for 2023, the top 10 languages are: Python, Java, C++, C, JavaScript, C#, SQL, Go, TypeScript, and… HTML (huh? the name literally says it’s a Markup Language). Notably, C, which started in 1972 but was officially published in 1978, couldn’t be criticized by Dijkstra at the time.
Visual Basic is ranked 24th, as Microsoft decided not to further develop the language in 2020.
Fortran remains at 27th place, COBOL at 34th, and Ada at 36th.
Lastly, Pascal/Delphi is mentioned at 45th place.</p>



<h3>Neither is BASIC</h3>



<p>BASIC didn’t stop in its evolution, of course, either.  These show the language is still valued for simplicity and ease of use with hardware. Notable mentions include:</p>



<ul>
<li>The QuickBASIC that was included in MS-DOS, keeping it possible to easily access a basic programming language. </li>



<li>Visual Basic (with Visual Basic .NET, VBScript, and office packages scripting languages such as Microsoft’s Visual Basic for Applications and OpenOffice Basic that evolved from this one) – Microsoft’s continuation of the BASIC lineage over the years. You could trace its evolution from a beginner-friendly language to a full-featured professional development tool. However, in 2020 Microsoft announced there is no further development of the language planned.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.freebasic.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeBASIC</a>. This is an open source project, and very feature rich. </li>



<li><a href="https://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcbasic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC BASIC</a> – this one has a long history! It’s an evolution of the language created for the BBC Micro computer in 1981. Supports a massive amount of operating systems today (from 80s CP/M computers, through Raspberry Pi, to Android and iOS). The site is also strong on the documentation side.</li>



<li><a href="https://smallbasic-publicwebsite.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SmallBasic</a> by Microsoft – intended to learn programming, “even by kids”, which actually suggests it may focus on the simplicity of “fun” features that BASIC brought. It also brings in turtle graphics, a concept introduced by the language LOGO, which brought a new, relative, approach to drawing things on the screen.</li>



<li>BASIC dialects such as <a href="https://www.b4x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">B4X</a> can even run on microcontrollers – Versions of BASIC have been created for Arduino and other microcontroller boards, bringing back the spirit of early PC BASICs.

Known for its accessibility and approachable documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3>But what would have the same effect today?</h3>



<p>While the BASIC name may not have the popularity it once held in the home computing era, the language’s legacy lives on in various forms today. </p>



<p>A great place to start and see immediate interesting effects with little code would be the <strong>Processing</strong> language (also available in JS as p5js). They provide simple APIs for drawing graphics, animations, and visualizations in an immediate way reminiscent of classic BASIC interpreters. Take a look at the example: <a href="https://processing.org/examples/tree.html">Recursive Tree / Examples / Processing.org</a> – the language has features that BASIC was lacking, allowing you to properly structure the code, <strong>and</strong> it has super easy to use commands to draw things on the screen, or even render 3D objects. </p>



<p>The notion that Processing is an example of is called “creative coding”, and Processing is as good at it as BASIC was in the 80s. Check out the Bull’s eye demo below, or <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/492680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Floating In Space</a>:</p>







<p>I would highly recommend it for creative and fun experiments, but there are other options, too, of course. Let’s mention at least a few.</p>



<p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/about" data-type="link" data-id="https://scratch.mit.edu/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scratch</a>, the colorful block-based programming language designed for kids, carries the torch of BASIC’s legacy perhaps better than any other modern tool. By using visual blocks that snap together like puzzle pieces rather than typed syntax, it removes a major early barrier to coding creativity that existed even in simplified BASIC versions. Themed graphics, animations, and sound libraries make exploration even more fun for budding young programmers. Just as BASIC and early home computers created a gateway for many tech pioneers, Scratch aims to foster that same experimental spirit, no matter a child’s prior access to technology or education. Its online community also connects peers to share and remix projects – a markedly more social approach than solo BASIC tinkering of the past.</p>



<p>If you’re more comfortable in programming in general and don’t hesitate using more commands to achieve your result, as the cost for more flexibility and portability, consider JavaScript – While not strictly BASIC-derived, JS has a very loose, dynamic style that echoes some qualities of the language. The fact that it’s so widely used for interactive web apps connects to BASIC’s interactive nature.</p>







<p>While the BASIC name may not have the popularity it once held in the home computing era, the language’s legacy lives on in various forms today. Modern tools like Processing and p5.js for creative coding projects have inherited BASIC’s focus on accessibility and rapid visualization for beginners. Inspired by Java and JavaScript respectively, they provide simple APIs for drawing graphics, animations, and visualizations in an immediate way reminiscent of classic BASIC interpreters. Scratch carries on BASIC’s mantle for introducing young students to programming in a fun and intuitive environment.</p>



<p>Even outside the realm of purely educational tools, JavaScript itself, despite no direct lineage from BASIC, has a flexible, beginner-friendly coding style that echoes some of BASIC’s most famous qualities. The fact that JavaScript powers most interactive websites and web apps today mirrors how BASIC enabled new realms of software interactivity in the early PC era. And for those yearning for BASIC’s glory days on microcomputers, modern microcontroller boards like Arduino often have custom BASIC interpreters and compilers created by the community to control hardware projects. So while it evolves across new platforms, BASIC’s accessibility and focus on rapid iteration persists in the DNA of many modern coding tools.</p>



<p>While Dijkstra’s inflammatory criticism of BASIC was controversial, his quote sparked discussion that influenced the growth of computer science education and programming language design. The history of BASIC illustrates how strongly opinions can differ regarding the best way to balance simplicity and power when creating tools for novice programmers. In its early days, BASIC favored ease of use over advanced capabilities, though over time it evolved by incorporating more features without compromising approachability. Modern BASIC dialects aim to offer a gentle starting point along with capabilities to take on more complex coding. There are still debates around finding the right equilibrium to serve programmers across the skill spectrum. However, the differing perspectives pushed the field forward. In the end, a diversity of languages can coexist, fitting different needs. The intensity of Dijkstra’s viewpoints sheds light on how passionately programmers care about building the best systems for their peers to create software magic and unlock human potential. While his criticism was extreme, it opened valuable dialogue.</p>







<p>Dartmouth College documentary about BASIC for the 50th anniversary (2014) highlights other key features of the system, such as time-sharing (BASIC was actually used concurrently by multiple users!)</p>
