    <p>Last updated 5 days, 17 hours ago</p>
<ul>
<li>updated my description cloud on the front page to be a little less serious. important work lol.</li>
<li>uploaded the beginning of my <a href="https://notes.olu.online">notes</a> site, it&#39;s <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/">quartz</a> with styling changes. Let me know if the <a href="https://superpencil.com/en/blog/hello-johto-sans">font</a> is hard to read; I enjoy it but am unsure if I should just stick to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code">Fira Code</a>. Messing around with quartz has been so interesting and I hope to get more involved with the coding side of PKM/note-taking/tools for thought, they&#39;re such interesting front-end challenges.</li>
<li>daily pages — my word for what is usually knows as <a href="https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">morning pages</a> — which I&#39;ve been doing for 45 days now (if i complete them today) are going okay? Yesterday and the day before were a struggle. I use <a href="https://new.750words.com/">750 words</a> which is what it sounds like in length, and sometimes I want to write &#34;today was okay, isn&#39;t it?&#34; and be done with writing but I am a sucker for a streak. Probably need to stop doing them before bed.</li>
<li>I do a gratitude thing I made up based on an Alice in Wonderland quote; at least six impossible things happen every day and I list the ones from the day before each day in <a href="https://capacities.io">Capacities</a>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Alice laughed. &#39;There&#39;s no use trying,&#39; she said. &#39;One can&#39;t believe impossible things.&#39;</p>
<p>I daresay you haven&#39;t had much practice,&#39; said the Queen. &#39;When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I&#39;ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Feeling really inspired by <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/gathering-structures">Gathering Structures</a> by Maggie Appleton, and then despairing of the state of search engines that I can&#39;t find much that&#39;s not focused on businesses on setting up online communities. Will probably ask on all the <a href="https://olu.online/contact">social media</a> after finishing this.</li>
<li>On search engines: I&#39;ve been trying out <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a> and enjoy the lenses but wonder if there&#39;s better search engines for indie web stuff.</li>
<li>Thinking about zines and whether I want to make one (or several) still.</li>
<li>Really enjoying the kith, kin and community I have, and thinking about ways to &#34;give back&#34; and contribute to the world, as ever. I think I have more of an idea of the things I can and should do now. Really glad I got over my effective altruism phase a while ago; things were bad but seems to have gotten worse with the AI boom.</li>
<li>Decided to stop trying to search for a useful way of organising private notes and just try to rely on great search and good capture habits.</li>
</ul>
