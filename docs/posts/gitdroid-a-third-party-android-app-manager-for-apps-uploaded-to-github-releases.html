        <p>I had been thinking of writing a completely different blog post, but just a while ago I got sidetracked by <a href="https://karpathy.ai">Andrej Karpathy</a>’s <a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/vibe-coding-menugen/">post on vibe coding at a hackathon</a>. It is a great time to be alive when LLMs are changing technology forever, and one of the most famous researchers in AI is trying it out like the rest of us developers.</p>
<h2 id="my-vibe-coding-experience">My vibe coding experience</h2>
<p>Even before the term was <a href="https://blog.codepromptfu.com/posts/what-are-ai-prompts-for-coding/">invented in a tweet</a> I had almost stopped writing code by hand. I let LLMs write at least 90% of any code I commit, and use LLM advice for the writing the rest. Here is a graphical representation of all the vibe coding I did in the last few months (thanks to <a href="https://windsurf.com">Windsurf</a>).</p>

<p>In the last few months I have vibe coded and launched some small websites, like</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://codepromptfu.com">A stackoverflow for coding prompts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kidsbdaygifts.com">A gift searching site</a></li>
<li><a href="http://doodle-game-2d.vercel.app/">A browser-based game for kids</a></li>
<li><a href="http://totoro-comics.vercel.app/">A Totoro comic maker</a> (I did this before OpenAI created the ‘Ghibli storm’)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have also been working on a full-stack web app for a startup, among other things.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-delightful-about-vibe-coding">What is delightful about vibe coding</h2>
<h3 id="the-beginning">The beginning</h3>
<p>Some people cannot start writing on an empty page. I think I am one of them. Vibe coding gives you a huge headstart - at least for web apps and websites. If you use small, concise prompts for each step of your project, you will almost always get working code.</p>
<h3 id="getting-unstuck">Getting unstuck</h3>
<p>Of course every project runs into issues. Every day. I have found that LLMs are better at debugging than you alone. At least you don’t need to wade through half of the internet to find the best answer for you.</p>
<h3 id="api-integration">API integration</h3>
<p>Nothing on the web can be done reliably without using third-party APIs. The leading vibe coding environments do a decent job on this front as well. Choosing the right API also used to be a challenge. Again, LLM-based tools like <a href="https://perplexity.ai">Perplexity</a> and <a href="https://www.claude.ai">Claude</a> save you time and keep you moving faster.</p>
<h3 id="coming-up-with-new-approaches">Coming up with new approaches</h3>
<p>Many times I have been pleasantly surprised by the way LLMs generate code for a task. Specially when it is not what I thought, but something better. Yes, this has happened many times with me. Which is why I often ask the LLM to write some code even though I also know one way of doing it. I guess there are always multiple ways of programming to solve the same problem. It is also probably because I am not a great programmer - most of my initial ideas are sub-optimal.</p>
<h2 id="what-needs-to-get-better">What needs to get better</h2>
<h3 id="framework-version-changes">Framework version changes</h3>
<p>Sometimes the AI tools are not able to keep up with changes in software frameworks. I think this problem should go away when the vibe coding tools become more agentic.</p>
<h3 id="ui-improvements">UI improvements</h3>
<p>The only tool which I have been seen create decent UIs is <a href="https://v0.dev">v0</a>. There must be others too. But I am not happy with the kind of UI created by vibe coding IDEs today. Given that the basic purpose of all apps is to help humans, better UIs are a necessity. Humans judge by looks far too much.</p>
<h3 id="rust-support">Rust support</h3>
<p>I have recently started trying to vibe code in Rust, and that has been quite rocky. I am waiting for this to improve, because I believe Rust is a far easier language for machines to understand. Unless that is exactly why it is not the best thing for LLMs, which are more human than traditional computer algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="what-next">What next</h2>
<p>I am waiting for this novelty around vibe coding to wear off. When this becomes the ’new normal’ and we don’t even notice it, we no longer might have to sit at a desk and do programming. Maybe we’ll be on a call with an AI agent who is doing the job, while we get to do better things in life.</p>
