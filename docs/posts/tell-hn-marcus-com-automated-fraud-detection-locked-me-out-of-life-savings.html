    <h1>Tell HN: Marcus.com&#39; automated fraud detection locked me out of life savings</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Long story short, Marcus.com&#39; automated fraud detection system flagged one of my transactions. Account got locked, since I don&#39;t live in the U.S. anymore and have no U.S. phone number there is no way for them to ascertain my identity. Now stuck adding higher-ups on LinkedIn to see if I can get some personal support.</p><p>Any advice how to deal with this? Here is the full story which some of you might have lived through already:</p><p>I have most of my life savings with Marcus.com, an account that I opened in 2019. I always used the same 1-2 bank accounts to transfer money in and out. In 2020 I moved back to my home country in Europe but left the savings accounts open.</p><p>About 4 weeks ago I added a new bank account to transfer money to (a wise.com account with Evolve Bank &amp; Trust). I verified the account (two deposits) and then proceeded to transfer half of my savings with the intent of converting it into Euros to use in my home country.</p><p>1 day later, transfer got reversed. I can still access my account but not transfer any of my money anywhere.</p><p>Upon calling customer service, I learn that the transaction was flagged. The only way they can prove my identity is by sending a text to a phone number registered in my name. That doesn’t work since I don’t have a phone number in my name in the U.S. anymore. The phone number to access the account for 2FA is a VoiP service. Ok, great. Now what?</p><p>Well, apparently they can send an affidavit to my account address in the U.S. (which is my brother-in-law’s address where we usually visit when we’re there) which I can notarize with my ID and send to them. Takes between 5-10 business days. Perfect, let’s do that. I will be in the U.S. during that time frame.</p><p>1 week – no affidavit. I call – the affidavit still needs to be approved. 2 weeks later – still no affidavit. I call them “The affidavit still hasn’t been approved”. Every time a different set of agents, each giving the same canned responses. Finally I get a supervisor on the phone “we will expedite a phone call to you and the security team will ascertain your identity. This takes 1-3 business days. If they miss you, they will leave a voice mail and you can call back the hotline”.</p><p>Obviously, no phone call ever happens. No voice mail happens. No affidavit is sent. Call agents still telling me “I am sorry this is happening but we need to wait for approval”. I feel like I am stuck in hell. No single employee that contacts me, no one that owns my case. Is this the future we create for ourselves? Unbelievable.</p><p>Anyone that has been in a similar situation, how did you deal with this?</p></div></div></div>
