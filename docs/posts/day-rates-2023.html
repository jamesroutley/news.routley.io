        <p>One year ago, I switched from charging project fees to day rates. It’s been transformative on lots of fronts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything below comes with the following preface/caveat:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s no universally perfect charging method: I’m writing this to highlight something that’s been working for me</li>
<li>These thoughts are somewhat of a work-in-progress</li>
<li>
<strong>Your mileage will vary</strong>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Until last year, I’d almost exclusively quoted project rates. This had worked ok but I’d found it difficult to get the balance right. A couple of years ago, I read Sanctuary Computer’s pieces on <a href="https://garden3d.substack.com/p/were-not-a-traditional-agency">value pricing</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/sanctuary-computer-inc/how-we-quote-technology-2b0f8e9b627f">quoting technology</a>: these pieces strongly resonated with me.</p>
<p>The popularity of value pricing has led to pricing by time getting a bad rep among freelancers and independents. I’d never felt comfortable with value pricing, and found some issues in charging by project, so switching to time-based quoting has been a revelation.</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits I’ve experienced in pricing by day:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Clients fundamentally understand the concept of days much more easily.</strong> </li>
<li>
<strong>There’s no scope creep or over/under-charging.</strong> </li>
<li>
<strong>Delivering a fixed-cost quote requires a lot of upfront work.</strong> </li>
<li>
<strong>My calendar is easier to plan</strong> </li>
<li>
<strong>I’ve found it much easier to squeeze in days for requests/small projects.</strong> </li>
<li>
<strong>Income is easier to predict.</strong> </li>
<li>
<strong>I offer a reduction in rate for some types of clients and day rates make it easier to demonstrate this.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>It’s quicker to see whether a project is viable.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p>I’m aware that some of my discomfort around project rate management are not insurmountable (i.e. ‘out-of-scope’ conversations). Changing the way I charge has helped to reduce some of the inherent frictions I found with project-based pricing, and I’ve generally found any new frictions to be easier to handle.</p>
<p>Without getting into the weeds, there are two common objections to time-based pricing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Billing by time penalises efficiency.</strong> </li>
<li>
<strong>Value pricing lets you increase rates for bigger businesses.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p>On balance, I’ve found this new method of charging to be incredibly positive. I’m only a year in, so things may change, but  I’ll be sticking with this for now.</p>
