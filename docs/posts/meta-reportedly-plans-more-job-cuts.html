    <h1>Meta reportedly plans more job cuts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Facebook parent company Meta reportedly plans to further reduce its headcount in the coming weeks. According to the<em> </em><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/3f3c3fe7-fedd-4fcd-a3d9-6ce44fe56e08" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0"><em>Financial Times</em></a>, work at the tech giant has slowed to a crawl while it plots a new round of job cuts. Meta is likely to announce the restructuring after it has completed staff performance reviews sometime in March. In November, the company laid off <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-mass-layoffs-facebook-111406126.html" data-ylk="cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0">11,000 employees</a> or about 13 percent of its global workforce. Those cuts were the largest in Meta’s nearly 20-year history, affecting every organization within the company. Meta did not immediately to Engadget’s comment request. <em>The Times </em>did not report on the potential scale of the restructuring.</p>
<p>While Meta is far <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tech-layoffs-183005204.html" data-ylk="cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0">from the only company</a> to cut staff in the past year, significantly fewer have expanded previously announced layoffs. If the reporting from <em>The Times</em> is accurate, Meta would find itself in the company of the likes of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/coinbase-lay-offs-reduced-expenses-153433234.html?uuid=DY2ln5q3N7G4YQbE4064" data-ylk="cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0">Coinbase</a>. In June, the company let go of approximately <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/coinbase-job-cuts-layoffs-150838290.html" data-ylk="cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0">1,100 employees</a>, only to announce at the start of the year it was cutting a <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/coinbase-lay-offs-reduced-expenses-153433234.html?uuid=DY2ln5q3N7G4YQbE4064" data-ylk="cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0">further 950 jobs</a>. Before November, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-q3-2022-earnings-211903277.html" data-ylk="cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0">told analysts</a> the company could become “a slightly smaller organization” by the end of 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Correction 02/13/22 1:31PM ET</strong>: A previous version of this article mistakenly said Amazon had announced layoffs that would affect 10,000 employees only to later expand the scope of its workforce reduction.
