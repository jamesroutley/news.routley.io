    <h1>Ask HN: How to get started with robotics as a hobbyist?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><p>I wanted to find new hobbies for myself, something that involves more physical stuff compared to only code. How did you started on your journey with robotics, what&#39;s handy to learn in the first place? I know only basics about embedded programming and I&#39;d need to brush up of my physics skills. I don&#39;t have a set goal in my mind, only exploring for the time being.</p></td></div></div>
