VIASAT incident: from speculation to technical details.

<p>34 days after the incident, yesterday Viasat <a href="https://www.viasat.com/about/newsroom/blog/ka-sat-network-cyber-attack-overview/" target="_blank">published</a> a statement providing some technical details about the attack that affected tens of thousands of its SATCOM terminals. Also yesterday, I eventually had access to two Surfbeam2 modems: one was targeted during the attack and the other was in a working condition. Thank you so much to the person who disinterestedly donated the attacked modem.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhUY4m1_dlVCo1UX6OcECpi5tTS3UiRne-gwOVvZ3hnl7PQqXHJZRwQoSZP7T5HUefHaURJNNPuDIrBDTHZdctMrfZy3OcWZGjN-fOd5z3XWVJuOMgszfFix3exr6htcHmxNnp_UPkJZe2q7rvYWhN_UKY3KcPSiKshgZHDl5k5VDphrtpgyidwkkUrYg/s2770/dumping.png"><img data-original-height="1770" data-original-width="2770" height="408" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhUY4m1_dlVCo1UX6OcECpi5tTS3UiRne-gwOVvZ3hnl7PQqXHJZRwQoSZP7T5HUefHaURJNNPuDIrBDTHZdctMrfZy3OcWZGjN-fOd5z3XWVJuOMgszfFix3exr6htcHmxNnp_UPkJZe2q7rvYWhN_UKY3KcPSiKshgZHDl5k5VDphrtpgyidwkkUrYg/w640-h408/dumping.png" width="640"/></a></p><p>I&#39;ve been closely covering this issue since the beginning, providing a <a href="https://www.reversemode.com/2022/03/satcom-terminals-under-attack-in-europe.html" target="_blank">plausible theory</a> based on the information that was available at that time, and my experience in this field. Actually, it seems that this theory was pretty close to what really happened.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiLh44RuEq3rdNmQbkKt8laM2qUBiKSEDQ4XKP3AiOKCC70_2hSAH3SzoXYTT9GJwLssRFtRIBOljcq2EH39JXRExFz-uLs-oUSGmGAbnF-PFKmf_QjTVv7tX3DIbV2TvBw1qKimukWycOks-2I4Zilvk68O09sL3xdXdBIVoJ6clUxfJFFUiTko0B62Q/s1534/viasat_statement.png"><img data-original-height="394" data-original-width="1534" height="164" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiLh44RuEq3rdNmQbkKt8laM2qUBiKSEDQ4XKP3AiOKCC70_2hSAH3SzoXYTT9GJwLssRFtRIBOljcq2EH39JXRExFz-uLs-oUSGmGAbnF-PFKmf_QjTVv7tX3DIbV2TvBw1qKimukWycOks-2I4Zilvk68O09sL3xdXdBIVoJ6clUxfJFFUiTko0B62Q/w640-h164/viasat_statement.png" width="640"/></a></p><p>Fortunately, now we can move from just pure speculation into something more tangible, so I dumped the flash memory for both modems (Spansion <a href="https://www.datasheetq.com/datasheet-download/597536/1/Spansion/S29GL256P90TFCR2" target="_blank">S29GL256P90TFCR2</a>) and the differences were pretty clear.

------ Update 03/12/2022 Reuters has published new information on this incident, which initially matches the proposed scenario. You can find the  update   at the bottom of this post. ------ February 24th: at the same time Russia initiated a full-scale attack on Ukraine, tens of thousands of KA-SAT SATCOM terminals suddenly  stopped  working in several european countries: Germany, Ukraine, Greece, Hungary, Poland...Germany&#39;s Enercon moved forward and acknowledged that approximately 5800 of its wind turbines, presumably those remotely operated via a SATCOM link in central Europe, had lost contact with their  SCADA server .  In the affected countries, a significant part of the customers of Eutelsat&#39;s domestic broadband service were also unable to access Internet.  From the very beginning Eutelsat and its parent company Viasat, stated that the issue was being investigated as a cyberattack. Since then, details have been scarcely provided but few days ago I came across a really inter

In September &#39;21, I came across this story  &#34;Swiss Post Offers up to €230,000 for Critical Vulnerabilities in e-Voting System&#34;  while catching up with the security news.  The headline certainly caught my attention as it looked like an outlier from the regular bug bounty programs or well-known exploit contests, not only for the announced rewards but mainly because of the target. So essentially Swiss Post , the national postal service of Switzerland, was opening to the general public a bug bounty program, using the YesWeHack  platform, intended to uncover vulnerabilities in its future e-voting system. The first part of this blog post series will detail the approach used to analyze the Swiss Post e-voting system, as well as the first round of vulnerabilities that I reported during September/October &#39;21.
