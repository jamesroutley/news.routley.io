Several studies have found that lowering resting heart rate can have benefits for heart health and longevity (<span>Husmann 2011</span>). Exercise training is one way to achieve a lower resting heart rate. <span>Choe 2015</span> found that certain video processing techniques can improve the accuracy of measuring resting heart rate. Loimaala 2000 found that 5 months of moderate exercise training lowered resting heart rate, though</p></div></div></div><div><div data-w-id="295f4bbc-56a4-d6ea-6600-b522f8e43d03"><h3>View sources for every answer<br/></h3><div><div><p>“A meta-analysis of 30 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials concluded that fish oil consumption can significantly reduce heart rate (<span>Mozaffarian 2005</span>). In particular, the effect was greater in people whose baseline heart rate was higher: in the overall pooled estimate, fish oil decreased heart rate by 1.6 bpm compared to placebo, but reduced heart rate by 2.5 bpm in trials with a median baseline heart rate of ≥ 69 bpm. Furthermore, the ability of fish oil to reduce heart rate appeared to depend on the length of treatment.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div data-w-id="395c37b5-50d3-9c6e-75bb-98167c6fcec5"><h3>Ask questions to papers<br/></h3><div><div><p>Ask a question</p><div><p>What was the effect size in the first trial arm?</p></div></div><p>The effect size in the first trial arm is a marked reduction in spectral power in the ultra low frequency band for both heart rate variability and EMG when going from active to rest conditions, as well as significant changes in mean heart rate and EMG activity between the active and rest days. Additionally, there was a significant sex-by-activity interaction in the high frequency band of the RR interval power.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
