    <h1>The Constitutionality of Civil Forfeiture (2016)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content_html_wrap"><div>



<p><span><span>abstract. </span></span>Many state and federal statutes provide that when property is used
in certain prohibited ways, ownership of the property passes to the government.
Often, the statutes allow these forfeitures to be declared in civil proceedings
against the property itself, without the normal safeguards of the criminal
process. Indeed, if no one claims the property after proper notice, the
government’s assertion of ownership can become incontestable without any
judicial proceedings at all. Statutes authorizing such civil or administrative
forfeiture might seem like egregious violations of both property rights and
criminal-procedure rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution. But while
forfeiture statutes may be unfair and unwise, this Feature cautions
originalists not to assume that they are unconstitutional. The Feature
concludes that the original meaning of the Constitution (as liquidated by
historical practice) does not foreclose the three key features of forfeiture
statutes considered here: the fact that noncriminal forfeiture typically
proceeds in rem rather than in personam, the fact that people often must file
timely claims in order to trigger judicial proceedings, and the fact that claimants
are not afforded the procedural protections that the Constitution requires for
criminal defendants.</p>

<hr/><h3>Introduction<a name="introduction"></a></h3>

<p>Everyone knows that the law denies people property rights in
illegal drugs and other contraband.<a name="_Ref422570970"></a><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1" id="footnote_number_1">1</a> But nonlawyers sometimes are
startled to learn that the law also strips people of property rights in
everyday items that simply have been used in a prohibited way. For instance,
when someone transports illegal drugs in a car, the federal Controlled Substances
Act provides that ownership of the car thereby passes to the federal
government.<a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftnref2" id="footnote_number_2">2</a>
Many other categories of property, including houses and land as well as
personal property, are similarly “subject to forfeiture to the United States”
if they are used in connection with drug trafficking or if they are the
proceeds of such trafficking.<a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftnref3" id="footnote_number_3">3</a> In the words
of the Controlled Substances Act, “no property right shall exist in [these
things]”<a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftnref4" id="footnote_number_4">4</a>
and “[a]ll right, title, and interest in [them] . . . shall vest
in the United States upon commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture.”<a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftnref5" id="footnote_number_5">5</a></p>

<p>To enforce these forfeitures, the government can use a
special set of procedures that may startle even lawyers. When the government
alleges that personal property has been forfeited under the Controlled
Substances Act, the government often can perfect its title without going to
court (aside, perhaps, from the ex parte process of getting a warrant to seize
the property in the first place).<a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftnref6" id="footnote_number_6">6</a> The government
does have to provide public notice of the seizure and its intention to declare
the property’s forfeiture, and the government must also send written notice “to
each party who appears to have an interest in the seized article.”<a name="_Ref432407542"></a><a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftnref7" id="footnote_number_7">7</a> Any interested person who wants to
contest the government’s position can trigger judicial proceedings by filing a
claim to the property.<a name="_ftnref8"></a><a href="#_ftnref8" id="footnote_number_8">8</a> But that is
not always advisable; the relevant judicial proceedings might take the form of
a criminal prosecution against the claimant,<a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftnref9" id="footnote_number_9">9</a>
and in any event they might cost the claimant more than the property is worth.<a name="_Ref433642472"></a><a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftnref10" id="footnote_number_10">10</a> Whether for those reasons or because
the government is usually correct, most forfeitures under the federal drug laws
are uncontested.<a name="_Ref432952466"></a><a name="_ftnref11"></a><a href="#_ftnref11" id="footnote_number_11">11</a> And if no one files a claim within a
fairly short deadline, the process need go no further: an administrative
official can issue a binding declaration of forfeiture, clearing the way for
the government to sell the property at auction or retain it for the
government’s own use.<a name="_ftnref12"></a><a href="#_ftnref12" id="footnote_number_12">12</a></p>

<p>Under current federal law, this method of “administrative
forfeiture” is available only for personal property (including cash),<a name="_ftnref13"></a><a href="#_ftnref13" id="footnote_number_13">13</a>
and only when no one files a claim. But even when the government needs to get
the courts involved, the government does not have to proceed in personam
against the former owner. Instead, the government often can seek judicial
confirmation of its ownership through proceedings in rem against the property
itself.<a name="_ftnref14"></a><a href="#_ftnref14" id="footnote_number_14">14</a>
While claimants have a right to participate in these “civil-forfeiture”
proceedings,<a name="_ftnref15"></a><a href="#_ftnref15" id="footnote_number_15">15</a>
they usually have no right to appointed counsel,<a name="_ftnref16"></a><a href="#_ftnref16" id="footnote_number_16">16</a>
and they also lack some of the other procedural advantages that would attend a
criminal prosecution. For instance, instead of having to prove each element of
a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt, the government need only prove
that the property is subject to forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence.<a name="_ftnref17"></a><a href="#_ftnref17" id="footnote_number_17">17</a></p>

<p>Over the past few decades, these practices have gone through
a cycle of expansion and reform. Starting in the 1970s and accelerating in the
1980s, Congress and state legislatures made civil and administrative forfeiture
an increasingly prominent tool of law enforcement, first in the war on drugs
and then in other areas.<a name="_Ref428094643"></a><a name="_ftnref18"></a><a href="#_ftnref18" id="footnote_number_18">18</a> In the 1990s, critics across the
political spectrum<a name="_ftnref19"></a><a href="#_ftnref19" id="footnote_number_19">19</a> raised
concerns about the plight of innocent owners who were not themselves responsible
for the misuse of their property,<a name="_Ref427563916"></a><a name="_ftnref20"></a><a href="#_ftnref20" id="footnote_number_20">20</a> the dangers of letting police
departments and other enforcement agencies fund themselves through forfeiture,<a name="_Ref434576172"></a><a name="_ftnref21"></a><a href="#_ftnref21" id="footnote_number_21">21</a> and the need for more procedural
safeguards to guard against erroneous or abusive confiscations of property.<a name="_ftnref22"></a><a href="#_ftnref22" id="footnote_number_22">22</a>
Congress responded to some of these criticisms by enacting the Civil Asset
Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000,<a name="_ftnref23"></a><a href="#_ftnref23" id="footnote_number_23">23</a> which made
targeted changes to federal forfeiture laws.<a name="_ftnref24"></a><a href="#_ftnref24" id="footnote_number_24">24</a>
More recently, the Department of Justice has been reviewing its asset-forfeiture
program, and the Department has announced new restrictions on how it will use a
few of the powers that federal law gives it.<a name="_Ref321311492"></a><a name="_ftnref25"></a><a href="#_ftnref25" id="footnote_number_25">25</a> Some state legislatures have gone
much farther; nine states require most forfeitures to be predicated on criminal
convictions,<a name="_Ref445543172"></a><a name="_ftnref26"></a><a href="#_ftnref26" id="footnote_number_26">26</a> and one of those states no longer
authorizes civil forfeiture at all.<a name="_Ref427486217"></a><a name="_ftnref27"></a><a href="#_ftnref27" id="footnote_number_27">27</a> Still, at the federal level and in
most states, a great deal of forfeiture continues to occur outside the criminal
process.<a name="_Ref442021406"></a><a name="_ftnref28"></a><a href="#_ftnref28" id="footnote_number_28">28</a></p>

<p>Groups ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union<a name="_ftnref29"></a><a href="#_ftnref29" id="footnote_number_29">29</a>
and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers<a name="_ftnref30"></a><a href="#_ftnref30" id="footnote_number_30">30</a>
to the Heritage Foundation<a name="_ftnref31"></a><a href="#_ftnref31" id="footnote_number_31">31</a> and the
Institute for Justice<a name="_ftnref32"></a><a href="#_ftnref32" id="footnote_number_32">32</a> are pushing
for further legislative reform. Ever since the 1990s, however, some lawyers and
scholars have been asking a more basic question: are civil and administrative
forfeiture even constitutional?<a name="_Ref433383103"></a><a name="_ftnref33"></a><a href="#_ftnref33" id="footnote_number_33">33</a></p>

<p><span>This Feature examines
evidence bearing on how originalists, in particular, might analyze that
question. More precisely, this Feature evaluates the constitutionality of civil
and administrative forfeiture from the perspective of the version of
originalism that I accept, in which historical research can serve at least two
different functions.</span><a name="_ftnref34"></a><a href="#_ftnref34" id="footnote_number_34">34</a><span> To the extent that particular constitutional
provisions have a determinate “original meaning,” historical research may help
modern readers identify that meaning.</span><a name="_ftnref35"></a><a href="#_ftnref35" id="footnote_number_35">35</a><span> But to the extent that the original meaning
of the Constitution is indeterminate, historical research can also help
establish how those indeterminacies were resolved or “liquidated” over time. As
I have discussed elsewhere,</span><a name="_Ref441492121"></a><a name="_ftnref36"></a><a href="#_ftnref36" id="footnote_number_36">36</a><span>
the concept of “liquidation” was prominent during the Founding era, when the
verb “to liquidate” could mean “to render unambiguous.”</span><a name="_ftnref37"></a><a href="#_ftnref37" id="footnote_number_37">37</a><span> Just as a “liquidated damages” clause in a
contract might pick a single number from a range of possibilities,</span><a name="_ftnref38"></a><a href="#_ftnref38" id="footnote_number_38">38</a><span> so too leading members of the Founding
generation anticipated that post-Founding practices or precedents would settle
on one of the permissible interpretations of provisions that lent themselves to
multiple readings.</span><a name="_Ref441827213"></a><a name="_ftnref39"></a><a href="#_ftnref39" id="footnote_number_39">39</a><span>
In the absence of “extraordinary and peculiar circumstances,”</span><a name="_ftnref40"></a><a href="#_ftnref40" id="footnote_number_40">40</a><span> moreover, those liquidations were expected
to be permanent; they would fix the Constitution’s meaning on points that could
otherwise have been disputed.</span><a name="_ftnref41"></a><a href="#_ftnref41" id="footnote_number_41">41</a></p>

<p><span>For anyone who
accepts the concept of liquidation,</span><a name="_ftnref42"></a><a href="#_ftnref42" id="footnote_number_42">42</a><span> it seems likely to play a prominent role in
debates about civil forfeiture. The constitutional provisions that may be most
directly relevant—the prohibitions on depriving people of property
“without due process of law”</span><a name="_ftnref43"></a><a href="#_ftnref43" id="footnote_number_43">43</a><span>—are widely thought to be at least
somewhat indeterminate.</span><a name="_ftnref44"></a><a href="#_ftnref44" id="footnote_number_44">44</a><span> As modern courts and commentators well know,
moreover, civil forfeiture has an impressive historical pedigree: </span>the
practice dates back to colonial America, continued unabated after the Founding,
and has not been rejected even today.<a name="_ftnref45"></a><a href="#_ftnref45" id="footnote_number_45">45</a></p>

<p>Of course, the facts that myriad early statutes included
forfeiture provisions and that courts willingly enforced those provisions
through civil proceedings in rem do not automatically prove that civil
forfeiture comports with the original meaning of the Constitution. Precisely
because civil forfeiture predated the Founding, early legislators and judges
may simply have followed familiar practices without appreciating the legal
import of the Due Process Clause or other relevant aspects of the Constitution.
But to the extent that practice can liquidate the meaning of the Constitution
on uncertain points, history tends to validate the constitutionality of civil
forfeiture <i>unless </i>the history is more
limited than it seems or the meaning of the Constitution is not uncertain.</p>

<p>Part I of this Feature considers possible limits on the
history. Several modern authors have argued that most early statutes
authorizing in rem forfeiture proceedings did so in contexts where the
statutes’ requirements could not reliably be enforced in personam, and these
authors suggest that history does not validate the use of in rem forfeiture in
other contexts.<a name="_Ref432951804"></a><a name="_ftnref46"></a><a href="#_ftnref46" id="footnote_number_46">46</a> There is something to that
argument—but, in my view, not enough. Both at the federal level and in
the states, various early statutes authorized forfeitures to be enforced in rem
even in the absence of any obvious barrier to proceedings in personam. As far
as I know, moreover, no early judges or lawyers interpreted the Due Process
Clause or related constitutional provisions to draw the distinction that modern
authors have suggested.</p>

<p>Part I goes on to consider a separate possible limitation.
Historically, statutes authorizing in rem forfeiture reached only items that
were themselves involved in illegal conduct, not items that simply were
purchased with the proceeds of such conduct. The use of in remprocess against the latter items is a
modern development. Given other well-accepted legal principles, though, Part I
concludes that this historical distinction does not make a constitutional
difference. </p>

<p>Part II considers a more fundamental objection to civil
forfeiture: under most of the relevant statutes, the forfeiture of property can
be regarded as a punishment for illegal behavior, and perhaps the Constitution
should be understood to prevent the imposition of punishment through civil
process. As Part II notes, the idea that punishment requires criminal process
can be traced back to nineteenth-century debates over punitive damages. But
those debates were resolved in favor of the constitutionality of using civil
process to impose some forms of punishment. Dating back to the beginning of the
Republic, moreover, state and federal statutes routinely backed up their
requirements with the threat of monetary penalties for violations, and such
penalties routinely were collected through civil actions. The forfeiture of
specific items of property does not seem any different—and, historically,
it too has been enforced through civil process.</p>

<p>To be sure, <i>some</i>
forms of punishment can be imposed only through criminal process. Cases in
which the government asks a court to punish someone with death or imprisonment
surely trigger the special procedural protections that the Constitution
requires for criminal prosecutions. But centuries of practice support the idea
that civil process can be used to declare the loss of property, even when that
loss is punitive.</p>

<p>Part III considers one further argument: even if statutes can
validly authorize <i>civil</i> forfeiture,
perhaps Congress cannot validly authorize <i>administrative</i>
forfeiture. Read broadly, a recent dissent by Chief Justice Roberts might seem
to suggest that executive officials can never declare, authoritatively, that
property has been forfeited to the United States; perhaps a binding declaration
of forfeiture requires “judicial” power even if no one claims the property
after proper notice.<a name="_ftnref47"></a><a href="#_ftnref47" id="footnote_number_47">47</a> Again,
though, Part III rejects this idea. While federal statutes authorizing
administrative forfeiture date back only to 1844 and not to the Founding,<a name="_ftnref48"></a><a href="#_ftnref48" id="footnote_number_48">48</a>
other well-accepted practices are analytically indistinguishable. If Congress
can establish other statutory deadlines for challenging executive action, then
Congress can also establish deadlines for contesting the government’s ownership
of property that the executive branch has seized.</p>

<p>These conclusions give me no pleasure. I am skeptical that
current forfeiture laws are good policy. But laws can be unwise and even unfair
without being unconstitutional. In my view, the basic characteristics of civil
and administrative forfeiture considered in this Feature are consistent with
the original meaning of the Constitution as liquidated over time. Reform
efforts should continue to focus on the political branches, not the courts.</p>

<h3>I. in
rem versus
in personam<a name="i-in-rem-versus-in-personam"></a></h3>

<p><span>Forfeiture laws
address the ownership of property. Although the details vary, the typical
forfeiture statute provides that when an item is possessed or used in violation
of specified legal restrictions, private ownership of the item ceases and title
vests in the government by operation of law.</span><a name="_ftnref49"></a><a href="#_ftnref49" id="footnote_number_49">49</a><span> Subject to some procedural restrictions,
moreover, the statute often makes it possible for law-enforcement officials to
take immediate possession of the item, through seizure, before the (former)
owner has had a chance to contest the government’s position in court.</span><a name="_ftnref50"></a><a href="#_ftnref50" id="footnote_number_50">50</a></p>

<p><span>Of course, statutes
cannot automatically give conclusive effect to an executive officer’s
determination that property previously vested in a private individual or entity
has been used in such a way that the property now belongs to the government.
Under doctrines that became prominent in the mid-nineteenth century but that
have roots in earlier understandings of both the federal Constitution and its
state counterparts, “[t]he legislative power . . . cannot directly reach the
property or vested rights of the citizen, by providing for their forfeiture or
transfer to another, without trial and judgment in the courts.”</span><a name="_Ref432952012"></a><a name="_ftnref51"></a><a href="#_ftnref51" id="footnote_number_51">51</a><span>
At the very least, the law could not authorize nonjudicial officials to make an
authoritative declaration of forfeiture unless the former owners had an <i>opportunity</i> to contest the government’s
position in court.</span><a name="_Ref432953427"></a><a name="_ftnref52"></a><a href="#_ftnref52" id="footnote_number_52">52</a></p>

<p><span>The requisite
judicial proceedings, however, did not necessarily have to be conducted </span>in
personam<span>. As Section I.A briefly
describes, </span>in rem<span> forfeiture proceedings
have an exceedingly long history in Anglo-American law. Section I.B considers
some efforts by modern scholars to cabin the relevant history, but concludes
that those efforts fail. Indeed, Section I.C argues that even the modern
expansion of </span>in rem<span> forfeiture
to the <i>proceeds</i> of illegal conduct
probably does not offend the Due Process Clauses as originally understood. In
any event, given the modern convergence of </span>in rem<span> and </span>in personam<span>
proceedings, Section I.D suggests that the </span>in rem<span> nature of civil forfeiture is not a promising target for
constitutional attack.</span></p>

<h3>A. A
Brief History of In Rem Forfeiture<a name="a-a-brief-history-of-in-rem-forfeiture"></a></h3>

<p><span>Long before the
American Revolution, both the English Parliament and legislatures in the
American colonies were using the threat of forfeiture to encourage compliance
with statutes. Forfeitures of this sort, moreover, often were enforced through
civil proceedings </span>in rem<span>. Modern
courts and commentators already know the outlines of the relevant history,</span><a name="_Ref426029563"></a><a name="_ftnref53"></a><a href="#_ftnref53" id="footnote_number_53">53</a><span>
but this Section provides a brief recap.</span></p>

<p><span>From the colonists’
perspective, some of the most prominent forfeiture provisions in English law
appeared in the Navigation Acts, many of which regulated colonial trade in the
service of England’s mercantilist system.</span><a name="_Ref426027428"></a><a name="_ftnref54"></a><a href="#_ftnref54" id="footnote_number_54">54</a><span>
For instance, the Navigation Act of 1660 required that English ships be used to
carry imports to and exports from the American colonies, “under the penalty of
the Forfeiture and Losse of all the Goods and Commodityes which shall be
Imported into, or Exported out of, any the aforesaid places in any other Ship
or Vessell, as alsoe of the Ship or Vessell with all its Guns Furniture Tackle
Ammunition and Apparell.”</span><a name="_Ref424646152"></a><a name="_ftnref55"></a><a href="#_ftnref55" id="footnote_number_55">55</a><span>
The same Act added that certain important products (including sugars, tobacco,
cotton, and wool) could not be exported from the American colonies to any place
not dependent on the English Crown, again upon pain of forfeiting both the
goods and the ship that carried them.</span><a name="_ftnref56"></a><a href="#_ftnref56" id="footnote_number_56">56</a><span> A few years later, Parliament imposed
similar restrictions in the other direction: most goods produced or
manufactured in Europe could enter the colonies only by way of England or
Wales, and goods illegally imported from elsewhere were forfeited along with
the ship in which they were imported.</span><a name="_ftnref57"></a><a href="#_ftnref57" id="footnote_number_57">57</a></p>

<p><span>Judicial proceedings
to enforce these forfeitures could take various forms. For instance, the
Navigation Act of 1660 explicitly authorized one of its provisions to be
enforced through prize cases in admiralty.</span><a name="_ftnref58"></a><a href="#_ftnref58" id="footnote_number_58">58</a><span> The term “prize case” refers to a special
type of proceeding </span>in rem<span>.</span><a name="_ftnref59"></a><a href="#_ftnref59" id="footnote_number_59">59</a><span> The laws of war allowed vessels acting under
the authority of one of the warring nations to try to capture vessels and
cargos belonging to citizens or subjects of the enemy.</span><a name="_Ref426027503"></a><a name="_ftnref60"></a><a href="#_ftnref60" id="footnote_number_60">60</a><span>
Upon a capture, the captors would take their prize to port and initiate </span>in
rem<span> proceedings in a court of
admiralty.</span><a name="_Ref433457709"></a><a name="_ftnref61"></a><a href="#_ftnref61" id="footnote_number_61">61</a><span>
Owners who denied that the property was lawful prize could appear in those
proceedings to contest the captors’ position,</span><a name="_ftnref62"></a><a href="#_ftnref62" id="footnote_number_62">62</a><span> but if the court agreed with the captors,
the court would enter a decree condemning the property, and the proceeds would
be distributed according to the law of the capturing nation.</span><a name="_ftnref63"></a><a href="#_ftnref63" id="footnote_number_63">63</a></p>

<p><span>In a sense, the
typical wartime prize case was a type of forfeiture proceeding, because the
previous owners were losing their property. But the cause of the forfeiture was
not that the property had been involved in some legal infraction.</span><a name="_Ref426026562"></a><a name="_ftnref64"></a><a href="#_ftnref64" id="footnote_number_64">64</a><span>
Instead of being a tool of law enforcement, prize cases usually were a tool of
war. Indeed, the law of prize was simply one manifestation of a broader
principle: as far as the laws of war were concerned, a nation could seize and
condemn <i>all </i>property owned or
possessed by the enemy’s adherents, on the theory that all such property adds
to the enemy’s strength.</span><a name="_ftnref65"></a><a href="#_ftnref65" id="footnote_number_65">65</a><span> The prize cases authorized by the Navigation
Act of 1660 were different, because they covered only property linked to
violations of the Act. Specifically, the section of the Act that prohibited the
use of foreign vessels for carrying goods to or from the colonies included the
following enforcement provision: </span></p>

<p>[A]ll Admiralls and other Commanders at Sea of any
the Ships of War or other Ship haveing Comission from His Majesty
. . . are hereby authorized and strictly required to seize and bring
in as prize all such Ships or Vessells as shall have offended contrary hereunto
and deliver them to the Court of Admiralty there to be proceeded against . . . .<a name="_ftnref66"></a><a href="#_ftnref66" id="footnote_number_66">66</a></p>

<p><span>Apart from this
provision authorizing certain naval seizures to be treated as prizes, many
sections of the Navigation Act of 1660 indicated that their forfeitures could
be enforced <i>qui tam</i>, through actions
brought “in any Court of Record” by any appropriate process (“Bill Information
Plaint or other Action”).</span><a name="_ftnref67"></a><a href="#_ftnref67" id="footnote_number_67">67</a><span> Despite this apparent breadth of options,
scholars agree that in England, as opposed to the colonies, the main forum for
enforcement proceedings was the Court of Exchequer—“the historic court of
the King’s revenue.”</span><a name="_ftnref68"></a><a href="#_ftnref68" id="footnote_number_68">68</a> There,
forfeiture proceedings “were commenced by civil information, . . . either in
personam or in rem.”<a name="_ftnref69"></a><a href="#_ftnref69" id="footnote_number_69">69</a><span> (The “information in rem” in the Court of
Exchequer was a traditional means for the king or a <i>qui tam</i> informer to obtain a judicial decree recognizing the
Crown’s ownership of specific items of property.<a name="_Ref427564082"></a></span><a name="_ftnref70"></a><a href="#_ftnref70" id="footnote_number_70">70</a><span> Although modern readers may think of
“informations” as being exclusively criminal, that was not the nature of
informations in the Court of Exchequer: even when brought to enforce statutory
forfeitures, an action upon an information </span>in rem<span> was a civil proceeding about the ownership of property.</span><a name="_Ref426976871"></a><a name="_ftnref71"></a><a href="#_ftnref71" id="footnote_number_71">71</a><span>
Indeed, the Court of Exchequer was said to have no criminal jurisdiction at
all.</span><a name="_ftnref72"></a><a href="#_ftnref72" id="footnote_number_72">72</a><span>)</span></p>

<p><span>In addition to the
restrictions on commerce found in the Navigation Act of 1660, England’s acts of
trade and navigation imposed customs duties on various goods.</span><a name="_ftnref73"></a><a href="#_ftnref73" id="footnote_number_73">73</a><span> Parliament backed up such duties with the
threat of forfeiture, and the forfeiture provisions sometimes covered not only
goods that were smuggled into England without payment but also the ships that
were used to carry them, the boats that were used to unload them, and the
horses and carriages that were used to take them away.</span><a name="_ftnref74"></a><a href="#_ftnref74" id="footnote_number_74">74</a><span> Again, the Court of Exchequer was the
traditional forum in England for actions to enforce forfeitures under both
customs and excise statutes,</span><a name="_Ref425502332"></a><a name="_ftnref75"></a><a href="#_ftnref75" id="footnote_number_75">75</a><span>
and again informations </span>in rem<span>
were used for this purpose.</span><a name="_ftnref76"></a><a href="#_ftnref76" id="footnote_number_76">76</a><span> (In the early eighteenth century, Parliament
authorized many forfeitures under these statutes to be handled instead by local
justices of the peace or commissioners of the excise,</span><a name="_ftnref77"></a><a href="#_ftnref77" id="footnote_number_77">77</a><span> but these matters too proceeded </span>in
rem<span>.</span><a name="_Ref425502361"></a><a name="_ftnref78"></a><a href="#_ftnref78" id="footnote_number_78">78</a>) </p>

<p><span>In the American
colonies too, forfeitures for violations of the acts of trade and navigation
were frequently enforced through civil proceedings </span>in rem<span>. Because the colonies lacked specialized
courts of exchequer, many early enforcement proceedings were brought in the
colonies’ existing courts of common law, which are said to have “closely
followed the procedure in Exchequer” (complete with trial by jury even in
proceedings </span>in rem<span>).</span><a name="_Ref426028007"></a><a name="_ftnref79"></a><a href="#_ftnref79" id="footnote_number_79">79</a><span>
By the end of the seventeenth century, though, “the obstinate resistance of
American juries” had led the Crown to seek another mechanism for enforcing the
Navigation Acts.</span><a name="_ftnref80"></a><a href="#_ftnref80" id="footnote_number_80">80</a><span> In 1696, Parliament gave concurrent
jurisdiction over enforcement proceedings in the colonies to a set of
vice-admiralty courts (which sat without juries),</span><a name="_ftnref81"></a><a href="#_ftnref81" id="footnote_number_81">81</a><span> and those courts eventually became the
primary forum for cases in the colonies about alleged violations of the
Navigation Acts.</span><a name="_Ref427563946"></a><a name="_ftnref82"></a><a href="#_ftnref82" id="footnote_number_82">82</a><span>
Again, forfeiture proceedings in the colonial vice-admiralty courts could
be—and were—brought </span>in rem<span>.</span><a name="_Ref425068462"></a><a name="_ftnref83"></a><a href="#_ftnref83" id="footnote_number_83">83</a></p>

<p><span>England’s approach to
colonial trade took a new direction in the 1760s, when Parliament sought to
address war debt by extracting more revenue from the colonies.</span><a name="_ftnref84"></a><a href="#_ftnref84" id="footnote_number_84">84</a><span> For instance, the Revenue Act of 1764
(portions of which were short-lived) increased customs duties on various goods
imported into or exported from the colonies.</span><a name="_ftnref85"></a><a href="#_ftnref85" id="footnote_number_85">85</a><span> Like other customs laws, the Act not only
threatened smugglers with personal penalties but also provided for the
forfeiture of property used in connection with smuggling.</span><a name="_ftnref86"></a><a href="#_ftnref86" id="footnote_number_86">86</a><span> The Act also explicitly allowed </span>prosecutors
and informers to bypass juries by using the vice-admiralty courts to recover
any forfeiture or penalty incurred in the colonies under “any . . . act or acts
of parliament relating to the trade and revenues of the said . . .
colonies”—even when analogous enforcement proceedings in England would
not trigger admiralty jurisdiction.<a name="_ftnref87"></a><a href="#_ftnref87" id="footnote_number_87">87</a></p>

<p>Colonists bitterly complained both about taxation without
representation and about the use of the vice-admiralty courts for revenue
matters that, in England, would have been tried to a jury in the Court of
Exchequer.<a name="_ftnref88"></a><a href="#_ftnref88" id="footnote_number_88">88</a>
But while the vice-admiralty courts were highly unpopular, the colonists did
not reject the general concept that statutes might use forfeiture as a tool of
law enforcement, or that forfeiture proceedings might be brought in rem rather
than in personam. To the contrary, when the United States gained independence,
the new states continued to use the threat of forfeiture to back up their own
customs and antismuggling laws, and many statutes explicitly authorized in rem
proceedings to enforce such forfeitures.<a name="_ftnref89"></a><a href="#_ftnref89" id="footnote_number_89">89</a></p>

<p>Once the Constitution created a federal Congress with
authority to levy taxes and to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, the
same was true at the federal level. When Congress convened in 1789, it promptly
imposed customs duties on imported goods<a name="_ftnref90"></a><a href="#_ftnref90" id="footnote_number_90">90</a>
and tonnage duties on ships,<a name="_ftnref91"></a><a href="#_ftnref91" id="footnote_number_91">91</a> and the
Collection Act that Congress passed to enforce those duties is replete with
forfeiture provisions.<a name="_ftnref92"></a><a href="#_ftnref92" id="footnote_number_92">92</a> Different
types of infractions triggered forfeitures of different breadth. For instance,
removing dutiable goods from a wharf before they were weighed or gauged made
only the goods themselves forfeit.<a name="_ftnref93"></a><a href="#_ftnref93" id="footnote_number_93">93</a>
But if goods worth at least $400 were unloaded and delivered from a vessel at
nighttime, or without a permit from the collector of customs, the forfeiture
extended to the vessel as well as the goods.<a name="_ftnref94"></a><a href="#_ftnref94" id="footnote_number_94">94</a>
With respect to these and other forfeitures, the statute contemplated in rem
proceedings against the forfeited goods and vessels, initiated by “seizure and
libel” and culminating in “condemnation.”<a name="_ftnref95"></a><a href="#_ftnref95" id="footnote_number_95">95</a></p>

<p>Although the federal Constitution did not have a Due Process
Clause when Congress enacted these provisions and the similar provisions in the
Collection Act of 1790,<a name="_ftnref96"></a><a href="#_ftnref96" id="footnote_number_96">96</a> ratification
of the Bill of Rights did not change Congress’s practices with regard to
forfeiture. Thus, when Congress revised the Collection Act in 1799, the new
statute included equally extensive forfeiture provisions,<a name="_ftnref97"></a><a href="#_ftnref97" id="footnote_number_97">97</a>
to be enforced through the same in rem proceedings.<a name="_ftnref98"></a><a href="#_ftnref98" id="footnote_number_98">98</a>
Early Congresses also used the threat of forfeiture (again enforced in rem) to
back up many other statutory restrictions on shipping, including limitations on
the slave trade,<a name="_ftnref99"></a><a href="#_ftnref99" id="footnote_number_99">99</a>
prohibitions on exporting certain goods,<a name="_ftnref100"></a><a href="#_ftnref100" id="footnote_number_100">100</a>
and embargoes on trading with certain nations.<a name="_ftnref101"></a><a href="#_ftnref101" id="footnote_number_101">101</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the old complaints about colonial
vice-admiralty courts, the Supreme Court soon held that when vessels or cargos
were seized on navigable waters under these or other statutes, the ensuing
forfeiture proceedings were properly brought in admiralty.<a name="_ftnref102"></a><a href="#_ftnref102" id="footnote_number_102">102</a>
By contrast, when property was seized on land, forfeiture cases usually
proceeded at law.<a name="_ftnref103"></a><a href="#_ftnref103" id="footnote_number_103">103</a> Whether
brought in admiralty or at law, though, forfeiture proceedings were commonly
conducted in rem. (At law, the normal process was an information in rem of the
sort used in England’s Court of Exchequer.<a name="_ftnref104"></a><a href="#_ftnref104" id="footnote_number_104">104</a>
In admiralty, the process was sometimes called an information and sometimes
called a libel, but again it was in rem.<a name="_ftnref105"></a><a href="#_ftnref105" id="footnote_number_105">105</a>)</p>

<p>The norm of enforcing forfeitures in rem was strong enough to
affect the interpretation of statutes that declared forfeitures but were not
specific about enforcement procedures. In 1809, for instance, Congress
supplemented the then-existing Embargo Act with further penal
provisions—some declaring forfeitures of vessels and cargos, others
imposing civil or criminal penalties on individuals.<a name="_ftnref106"></a><a href="#_ftnref106" id="footnote_number_106">106</a>
The 1809 statute addressed enforcement as follows: “[A]ll penalties and
forfeitures incurred by force of this act . . . may be prosecuted, sued for,
and recovered by action of debt, or by indictment or information . . . .”<a name="_ftnref107"></a><a href="#_ftnref107" id="footnote_number_107">107</a>
In an opinion prepared on circuit, Justice Story concluded that the word
“information” should be understood to encompass “proceedings in rem, for
forfeitures.”<a name="_Ref425492550"></a><a name="_ftnref108"></a><a href="#_ftnref108" id="footnote_number_108">108</a> He went on to indicate that such
proceedings were the standard way to recover forfeitures—so that even if
the statute had said nothing at all about the mode of enforcement, “I should
have had no doubt that an information [in rem] would have lain upon common law
principles.”<a name="_ftnref109"></a><a href="#_ftnref109" id="footnote_number_109">109</a></p>

<p>That was true even when forfeitures were incurred for
violations of a statute that also authorized personal penalties against
violators themselves: proceedings in rem to enforce a forfeiture did not have
to be predicated upon proceedings in personamagainst any violator (unless the relevant statute provided
otherwise). The standard citation for that proposition is <i>The Palmyra</i>,<a name="_ftnref110"></a><a href="#_ftnref110" id="footnote_number_110">110</a> a forfeiture
proceeding brought in rem under a federal statute that not only authorized the
prosecution of “any person or persons [who] shall, on the high seas, commit the
crime of piracy, as defined by the law of nations, and . . . shall
afterwards be brought into or found in the United States,” but also authorized
condemnation proceedings against “any vessel or boat, from which any piratical
aggression, search, restraint, depredation or seizure shall have been
. . . attempted or made.”<a name="_ftnref111"></a><a href="#_ftnref111" id="footnote_number_111">111</a>
According to Justice Story’s opinion for the Supreme Court, the longstanding
practice under statutes that authorized “both a forfeiture in rem and a
personal penalty” was that “the proceeding <i>in
rem</i> stands independent of, and wholly unaffected by any criminal proceeding
<i>in personam</i>.”<a name="_ftnref112"></a><a href="#_ftnref112" id="footnote_number_112">112</a>
Justice Story confirmed this understanding of the law: “[N]o personal
conviction of the offender is necessary to enforce a forfeiture <i>in rem</i> in cases of this nature.”<a name="_ftnref113"></a><a href="#_ftnref113" id="footnote_number_113">113</a></p>

<h3>B. Might
History Support In Rem Forfeiture Proceedings Only Where In Personam
Proceedings Would Have Been Difficult?<a name="b-might-history-support-in-rem-forfeiture-proceedings-only-where-in-personam-proceedings-would-have-been-difficult"></a></h3>

<p>At least for originalists, the historical pedigree of civil
forfeiture as a tool of law enforcement—dating back to colonial America,
continuing at the state level after independence, and carried forward at the
federal level from the First Congress on—might seem to support the
constitutionality of civil forfeiture as a tool of law enforcement today.
According to some modern commentators, however, the history is more limited
than it initially appears. Early federal forfeiture provisions were
concentrated in customs statutes and other laws about shipping,<a name="_Ref427564142"></a><a name="_ftnref114"></a><a href="#_ftnref114" id="footnote_number_114">114</a> which aimed partly to affect the
behavior of people outside the United States. Under traditional understandings
of personal jurisdiction, American courts could not have exercised in personam
jurisdiction over “at least some . . . and perhaps most” of those
people.<a name="_Ref427563994"></a><a name="_ftnref115"></a><a href="#_ftnref115" id="footnote_number_115">115</a> If Congress had not been able to
authorize in rem forfeiture proceedings against property that entered the
United States in violation of statutory requirements, then foreign shippers and
shipowners might have had little reason to pay customs duties or otherwise to
comply with federal shipping laws. Under these circumstances, in rem
forfeiture proceedings were a practical necessity if American shipping laws
were to be effective.<a name="_Ref426034821"></a><a name="_ftnref116"></a><a href="#_ftnref116" id="footnote_number_116">116</a> Some modern lawyers suggest that
history does not support the use of in rem forfeiture proceedings in other
circumstances.<a name="_ftnref117"></a><a href="#_ftnref117" id="footnote_number_117">117</a> If one sees
in rem forfeiture proceedings as compromising constitutional principles,
moreover, one might think that the Constitution prohibits expanding those
proceedings beyond their historical functions. In one of the most powerful
statements of this position, Stefan Herpel concludes that the Due Process
Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prevent the government from
using civil in rem forfeiture to enforce laws that could readily be enforced
through proceedings in personam.<a name="_ftnref118"></a><a href="#_ftnref118" id="footnote_number_118">118</a></p>

<p>The initial premise of this argument has deep historical
roots. Indeed, Rufus Waples—the lawyer who, in 1882, published the first
systematic study of actions in rem in the United States—observed that “in
a great proportion of causes <i>in rem</i>,
there would be no means of making a personal citation upon the owner of the <i>res</i>.”<a name="_ftnref119"></a><a href="#_ftnref119" id="footnote_number_119">119</a>
Sometimes that was because of territorial limits on jurisdiction in personam,
and sometimes it was simply because of the practical difficulty of identifying
the owner. (To illustrate the latter possibility, Waples noted the realities of
smuggling: when customs inspectors came across a cache of smuggled goods, the
inspectors could readily tell that the goods were being imported in violation
of law, but “it is almost always impossible to know who is the owner.”)<a name="_ftnref120"></a><a href="#_ftnref120" id="footnote_number_120">120</a>
For one reason or another, though, many of the areas in which American
legislatures traditionally authorized in rem forfeiture proceedings were areas
in which in personam enforcement could have been difficult.</p>

<p>Still, neither Waples nor earlier lawyers and judges
understood the Constitution to limit actions in rem to cases of this sort.<a name="_ftnref121"></a><a href="#_ftnref121" id="footnote_number_121">121</a>
Nor did early legislatures act upon such a theory. While legislatures did
authorize in rem proceedings in situations where in personam proceedings would
often have been impractical, they also authorized in rem proceedings in other
situations.</p>

<p>Federal tax statutes provide some examples. Admittedly, until
the Civil War, the main (and often the only) federal taxes were customs duties
on imported goods.<a name="_ftnref122"></a><a href="#_ftnref122" id="footnote_number_122">122</a> The fact
that federal customs statutes included forfeiture provisions is consistent with
Herpel’s thesis because a sizable fraction of customs violations would have
involved property owned by foreigners.<a name="_ftnref123"></a><a href="#_ftnref123" id="footnote_number_123">123</a>
But federal customs statutes did not limit the availability of in rem
procedures to this fraction of cases; by the terms of the statutes, forfeiture
proceedings were to be conducted in rem even if the owner of the subject
property could readily have been reached in personam.<a name="_ftnref124"></a><a href="#_ftnref124" id="footnote_number_124">124</a>
As Herpel acknowledges, moreover, there were periods in both the 1790s and the
1810s when Congress supplemented customs duties with domestic excise taxes
(that is, taxes on the production or sale of certain goods within the United
States).<a name="_ftnref125"></a><a href="#_ftnref125" id="footnote_number_125">125</a>
These “internal revenue” taxes had no international flavor, yet Congress
enforced them with the same sort of forfeitures that Congress used to enforce
customs duties.<a name="_ftnref126"></a><a href="#_ftnref126" id="footnote_number_126">126</a></p>

<p>Take the Act of March 3, 1791, by which the First Congress
imposed an excise tax on “spirits . . . distilled within the United
States.”<a name="_ftnref127"></a><a href="#_ftnref127" id="footnote_number_127">127</a>
In aid of collecting this tax, the statute not only imposed some monetary
penalties on violators, but also declared a broad variety of forfeitures. For
instance, if spirits were removed from a distillery without having been marked
as the law required, “the [spirits], together with the cask or casks containing
[them], and the horses or cattle, with the carriages, their harness and
tackling, and the vessel or boat with its tackle and apparel employed in
removing them, shall be forfeited, and may be seized by any officer of
inspection.”<a name="_ftnref128"></a><a href="#_ftnref128" id="footnote_number_128">128</a>
Likewise, spirits were not to be removed from a distillery except during
daylight hours, again “on pain of forfeiture of such spirits” and “the casks,
vessels and cases containing the same.”<a name="_ftnref129"></a><a href="#_ftnref129" id="footnote_number_129">129</a>
The statute contemplated that these forfeitures could be enforced “by
information,” just like the forfeitures that the same statute established in
aid of the customs duties on imported spirits.<a name="_ftnref130"></a><a href="#_ftnref130" id="footnote_number_130">130</a>
In the context of excise forfeitures as well as customs forfeitures, moreover,
the word “information” seems to have been understood to encompass informations
in rem.<a name="_ftnref131"></a><a href="#_ftnref131" id="footnote_number_131">131</a>
This understanding resonates with the traditional practice in England, where in
rem process had been used to enforce forfeitures incurred under excise as well
as customs statutes.<a name="_ftnref132"></a><a href="#_ftnref132" id="footnote_number_132">132</a> </p>

<p>One cannot always extrapolate from the procedures for
enforcing taxes to the procedures that would have been considered adequate in
other contexts.<a name="_ftnref133"></a><a href="#_ftnref133" id="footnote_number_133">133</a> But early
American lawmakers also included forfeiture provisions in a variety of other
statutes about purely domestic topics unrelated to taxation. Pursuant to those
statutes, items that were otherwise legitimate subjects of property could be
forfeited if used in violation of the law, and the forfeitures could be
declared through proceedings in rem.<a name="_Ref432596992"></a><a name="_ftnref134"></a><a href="#_ftnref134" id="footnote_number_134">134</a> For example, early American
legislatures provided for the forfeiture of horses used in races that violated
gambling laws,<a name="_ftnref135"></a><a href="#_ftnref135" id="footnote_number_135">135</a> shingles
sold in bundles that violated commercial regulations,<a name="_Ref429139615"></a><a name="_ftnref136"></a><a href="#_ftnref136" id="footnote_number_136">136</a> and gunpowder stored above the
quantities permitted by fire safety laws.<a name="_ftnref137"></a><a href="#_ftnref137" id="footnote_number_137">137</a></p>

<p>Of course, because of limits on Congress’s enumerated powers,
these laws were found primarily at the state and local level, and so they do
not bear directly on the original understanding of the Due Process Clause of
the Fifth Amendment. But many state constitutions had similar clauses of their
own,<a name="_ftnref138"></a><a href="#_ftnref138" id="footnote_number_138">138</a>
and these provisions apparently were not understood to prevent lawmakers from
authorizing in rem forfeiture proceedings against property used in violation of
the law.<a name="_ftnref139"></a><a href="#_ftnref139" id="footnote_number_139">139</a>
At any rate, early state and local laws of this sort do not seem to have
generated many constitutional challenges.</p>

<p>The earliest significant set of counterexamples may be the
Maine Liquor Law of 1851 and copycat statutes in other states, which prohibited
most sales of liquor and also authorized the seizure and forfeiture of liquor
intended for unlawful sale.<a name="_Ref425582895"></a><a name="_ftnref140"></a><a href="#_ftnref140" id="footnote_number_140">140</a> Those statutes did generate
constitutional challenges, and at first the challenges succeeded: several
courts concluded that the statutes’ enforcement provisions violated the state
constitution.<a name="_ftnref141"></a><a href="#_ftnref141" id="footnote_number_141">141</a>
As initially enacted, though, the Maine laws had a number of idiosyncratic
features that help explain the courts’ chilly reception. For instance, the
first generation of Maine laws contemplated a strange judicial process that appeared
to start in rem but that nonetheless put the owner or keeper of the liquor at
risk of personal penalties: if the court believed that the liquor was covered
by the statute and had been intended for unlawful sale, then not only would the
liquor “be declared forfeited . . . and be destroyed,” but the court would
fine the owner or keeper of the liquor twenty dollars or jail him for thirty
days in default of payment.<a name="_ftnref142"></a><a href="#_ftnref142" id="footnote_number_142">142</a> Partly
because of this feature, a federal circuit court in Rhode Island characterized
the forfeiture proceeding as a criminal prosecution rather than a civil case<a name="_Ref442020575"></a><a name="_ftnref143"></a><a href="#_ftnref143" id="footnote_number_143">143</a>—a view that the Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts echoed and that contributed to the conclusion
that the statute was unconstitutional because it did not conform to the requirements
for criminal procedure.<a name="_Ref442020580"></a><a name="_ftnref144"></a><a href="#_ftnref144" id="footnote_number_144">144</a> Once legislatures revised the
statutes to keep the in rem forfeiture proceedings more distinct from any
proceedings for personal penalties (and to supply appropriate process for the
latter),<a name="_ftnref145"></a><a href="#_ftnref145" id="footnote_number_145">145</a>
courts tended to uphold the forfeiture provisions.<a name="_Ref433647928"></a><a name="_ftnref146"></a><a href="#_ftnref146" id="footnote_number_146">146</a></p>

<p>The terms in which the Maine laws were debated, moreover,
suggest a broad consensus in favor of the constitutionality of the typical
forfeiture statute. Courts that upheld the Maine laws sought to group them with
other forfeiture provisions. Thus, Connecticut’s highest court emphasized that
“[f]orfeitures have frequently been imposed by laws of congress as well as by
other laws of this state, none of which have ever been adjudged
unconstitutional.”<a name="_ftnref147"></a><a href="#_ftnref147" id="footnote_number_147">147</a> By contrast,
courts that saw problems with the Maine laws sought to distinguish them from
other forfeiture provisions.<a name="_Ref433647942"></a><a name="_ftnref148"></a><a href="#_ftnref148" id="footnote_number_148">148</a> <i>Neither</i>
set of courts suggested that there is anything categorically unconstitutional
about using in rem forfeiture as a tool of domestic law enforcement. </p>

<p>In sum, early forfeiture provisions cannot be explained
entirely as a response to limits on in personam jurisdiction. Even in the
absence of apparent obstacles to proceedings in personam, antebellum American
legislatures sometimes authorized proceedings in rem, and courts seemed to
accept this practice.</p>

<h3>C. In
Rem Forfeiture of the Proceeds of Illegal Transactions<a name="c-in-rem-forfeiture-of-the-proceeds-of-illegal-transactions"></a></h3>

<p><span>There is at least one
respect in which modern civil-forfeiture statutes do go far beyond their
forebears. </span>Many of the modern statutes reach not only property that is
used to commit or facilitate an illegal transaction, but also the proceeds of
such transactions and property that is traceable to those proceeds.<a name="_ftnref149"></a><a href="#_ftnref149" id="footnote_number_149">149</a>
For instance, the concept of “proceeds forfeiture” explains why police
sometimes seize a great deal of property belonging to alleged drug
dealers—not on the theory that lawnmowers and television sets were used
to facilitate crimes, but on the theory that they were purchased with the
proceeds of those crimes.<a name="_ftnref150"></a><a href="#_ftnref150" id="footnote_number_150">150</a></p>

<p>As Justice Stevens has suggested, the use of in rem process
against property that was purchased with tainted funds appears to be a modern
invention.<a name="_ftnref151"></a><a href="#_ftnref151" id="footnote_number_151">151</a>
The first federal statute to authorize in rem forfeiture proceedings against
the proceeds of illegal transactions may date back only to 1978.<a name="_ftnref152"></a><a href="#_ftnref152" id="footnote_number_152">152</a>
Although Congress enacted more such statutes in the 1980s,<a name="_ftnref153"></a><a href="#_ftnref153" id="footnote_number_153">153</a>
the use of in rem process against property that was itself involved in illegal
conduct has a far stronger historical pedigree than the use of in rem process
against property that was merely acquired as a result of such conduct.</p>

<p>If the latter sort of forfeiture is an innovation,
originalists might wonder whether it comports with the Constitution. Of course,
if a legislature has the power to prohibit certain transactions, the
legislature probably also has the power to make the prohibited transactions
less profitable by providing for forfeiture of the proceeds. But might the Due
Process Clause require such forfeitures to be enforced in personam rather than
in rem?</p>

<p>At first glance, Rufus Waples’s 1882 treatise might seem to
support such a restriction. Waples acknowledged that the law could authorize
proceedings in rem against property that was itself “guilty” in the eyes of the
law.<a name="_ftnref154"></a><a href="#_ftnref154" id="footnote_number_154">154</a>
According to Waples, however, “<i>Things
Guilty </i>must have been <i>used</i> in
contravention of law, or held in contravention of law, to justify procedure
against them.”<a name="_ftnref155"></a><a href="#_ftnref155" id="footnote_number_155">155</a> Waples
explicitly cast this point in constitutional terms: “Congress cannot
constitutionally provide that property shall be condemned as guilty by
proceedings <i>in rem</i> where there is no
offense to be imputed” to the property.<a name="_ftnref156"></a><a href="#_ftnref156" id="footnote_number_156">156</a>
Thus, Waples thought that the Due Process Clause would prevent Congress from
“provid[ing] for the forfeiture of a ship engaged in legitimate commerce, by
proceedings directly against that ship, for the offense of illicit trade
carried on by another ship belonging to the same owner.”<a name="_ftnref157"></a><a href="#_ftnref157" id="footnote_number_157">157</a>
Likewise, if an illicit distillery was located on a large farm, “only such
acreage as is used for distilling purposes, and for ingress and egress, . . .
can be rightfully condemned, whatever the text [of the forfeiture statute] may
say.”<a name="_ftnref158"></a><a href="#_ftnref158" id="footnote_number_158">158</a>
To enforce a broader forfeiture, Waples suggested, the government would have to
proceed against the owner in personam rather than against the property in rem.<a name="_Ref428100637"></a><a name="_ftnref159"></a><a href="#_ftnref159" id="footnote_number_159">159</a> </p>

<p>Yet even if one accepts Waples’s understanding of the
constitutional limits on in rem process,<a name="_ftnref160"></a><a href="#_ftnref160" id="footnote_number_160">160</a>
modern proceeds-forfeiture statutes do not necessarily violate that
understanding. To be sure, some of the proceeds of illegal transactions might
not themselves have been used in contravention of the law. But the logic that
traditionally was used to explain civil forfeiture nonetheless allows the law
to reach those proceeds in rem.</p>

<p>To see why, one must start by recognizing that even when civil-forfeiture
statutes are designed to affect behavior, they take the form of property
regulations. Specifically, they identify circumstances in which the ownership
of property passes from one person to another by operation of law. For more
than two centuries, moreover, the Supreme Court has allowed Congress to provide
that when a particular item of property is used or transported in a manner that
the law validly prohibits, forfeiture occurs at that very moment.<a name="_Ref441155492"></a><a name="_ftnref161"></a><a href="#_ftnref161" id="footnote_number_161">161</a> Under forfeiture provisions of this
sort, ownership of the item passes to the government as soon as the item is
misused, and the item’s subsequent seizure and condemnation through proceedings
in rem simply confirm that a transfer of ownership has already occurred.<a name="_ftnref162"></a><a href="#_ftnref162" id="footnote_number_162">162</a>
Waples fully accepted this doctrine.<a name="_Ref421433890"></a><a name="_ftnref163"></a><a href="#_ftnref163" id="footnote_number_163">163</a> According to Waples, the fact that
the government has a preexisting interest in the property is precisely why the
government can proceed in rem.<a name="_ftnref164"></a><a href="#_ftnref164" id="footnote_number_164">164</a></p>

<p>Modern civil-forfeiture statutes address this topic
explicitly. Ever since 1984, the relevant section in the federal Controlled
Substances Act has specified that “[a]ll right, title, and interest in property
described in [the provision identifying property that is subject to forfeiture]
shall vest in the United States upon commission of the act giving rise to
forfeiture under this section.”<a name="_ftnref165"></a><a href="#_ftnref165" id="footnote_number_165">165</a> Since 1986,
the basic civil-forfeiture provision in Title 18 of the United States Code has
included essentially identical language.<a name="_ftnref166"></a><a href="#_ftnref166" id="footnote_number_166">166</a></p>

<p>Admittedly, these provisions may have hidden complexities. In
a concurring opinion from 1993, Justice Scalia interpreted the Controlled
Substances Act to embody what he called “the common-law relation-back
doctrine”: instead of literally acquiring title as soon as property becomes
subject to forfeiture, the government acquires title “only upon entry of the
judicial order of forfeiture,” but that order relates back to the date of the
wrongful act.<a name="_ftnref167"></a><a href="#_ftnref167" id="footnote_number_167">167</a>
While this interpretation solves some practical problems, it does not readily
fit the statutory language,<a name="_ftnref168"></a><a href="#_ftnref168" id="footnote_number_168">168</a> and it has
less historical support than Justice Scalia suggested.<a name="_Ref442119312"></a><a name="_ftnref169"></a><a href="#_ftnref169" id="footnote_number_169">169</a> Even on Justice Scalia’s view, though,
forfeiture statutes give the government <i>some</i>
sort of interest in property as soon as the property is misused.<a name="_ftnref170"></a><a href="#_ftnref170" id="footnote_number_170">170</a>
What is more, case law strongly suggests that Congress can go farther than
Justice Scalia read the Controlled Substances Act to go: it is within
Congress’s power to provide “that the forfeiture becomes absolute at the
commission of the prohibited acts, and that the title from that moment vests in
the United States.”<a name="_ftnref171"></a><a href="#_ftnref171" id="footnote_number_171">171</a></p>

<p>If Congress can indeed make forfeitures effective at the
moment that property is misused, then it follows almost inexorably that most
“proceeds forfeiture” is constitutional: Congress can subject the proceeds of
illegal transactions to the same sort of in rem process as property that was
directly involved in those transactions. In fact, some proceeds of illegal
transactions <i>were</i> directly involved
in those transactions. For instance, if I illegally sell drugs for money, the
money that I receive in the exchange is as much a part of the illegal
transaction as the drugs themselves. If the law can declare the forfeiture of
other items that are used for unlawful purposes, the law can also reach the
money used in the exchange.</p>

<p>That rationale for forfeiture might not seem to extend to
“derivative” proceeds of the illegal transaction, such as items that I buy with
the money that I received in exchange for drugs.<a name="_ftnref172"></a><a href="#_ftnref172" id="footnote_number_172">172</a>
But if the law can make forfeitures effective as of the moment of the unlawful
use, the law can specify that the money belonged to the government as soon as I
received it in exchange for drugs. To the extent that I then use the
government’s money to buy other items, moreover, the law presumably can provide
that those items belong to the government rather than me;<a name="_ftnref173"></a><a href="#_ftnref173" id="footnote_number_173">173</a>
just as equity might impose a “constructive trust” on such items,<a name="_ftnref174"></a><a href="#_ftnref174" id="footnote_number_174">174</a>
the law can provide that the government owns whatever I buy with money that
already has been forfeited to the government. Even on Waples’s view that the
government can bring an action in rem only against property in which the
government has a preexisting interest, it follows that the law can authorize
the government to bring an action in rem against such proceeds.<a name="_Ref441155504"></a><a name="_ftnref175"></a><a href="#_ftnref175" id="footnote_number_175">175</a></p>

<p>Because this argument is analytical rather than historical,
readers might wonder about its originalist bona fides. For originalists,
though, the fact that modern legislation lacks exact historical analogues does
not automatically make it unconstitutional. The point of researching history in
connection with evaluating the constitutionality of civil-forfeiture statutes
is not to ensure that modern civil-forfeiture statutes reach only the
categories of property that the early colonial, state, and federal statutes
declared to be forfeit, but rather to shed light on the constitutional
principles that might restrain such statutes. I take history to suggest that
the original meaning of the Constitution (as liquidated by historical practice)
tolerates statutes declaring that when property is used in certain prohibited
ways, ownership of the property passes to the government by operation of law,
and the government can confirm its title through proceedings in rem against the
property itself. If that is so, and if there is no sound basis for
distinguishing statutes that authorize in rem proceedings against items
obtained in trade for such property, the natural inference is that the
Constitution tolerates the latter statutes too.<a name="_ftnref176"></a><a href="#_ftnref176" id="footnote_number_176">176</a></p>

<h3>D. The
Modern Convergence of In Rem and In Personam Procedures<a name="d-the-modern-convergence-of-in-rem-and-in-personam-procedures"></a></h3>

<p>Even if the previous two Sections were not persuasive, there
is a further reason to question the idea that modern forfeiture statutes cannot
validly authorize proceedings in rem against the proceeds of illegal conduct,
or that proceedings in rem are permissible only when responsible individuals
cannot be pursued in personam. Arguments that the Due Process Clause requires
certain types of forfeiture cases to proceed in personam rather than in rem
assume that those two types of proceedings are quite different. That was true
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but it is no longer so true today.</p>

<p>Consider three important respects in which actions in rem
used to differ dramatically from actions in personam.</p>

<p>● <i>Notice and preclusive effects.</i>
Traditionally, a court’s decree about the ownership of property in an action in
rem was said to bind the entire world, including people who had not been given
any personalized notice of the proceedings.<a name="_ftnref177"></a><a href="#_ftnref177" id="footnote_number_177">177</a>
Although the initial seizure of the property might supply notice to the person
who had been in possession of the property at the time of the seizure, and
although notice of the proceedings also had to be posted or published in a
local newspaper, actions in rem did not require personal service of process on
any particular individual.<a name="_ftnref178"></a><a href="#_ftnref178" id="footnote_number_178">178</a> In the
mid-twentieth century, however, the Supreme Court held that whether a
proceeding is characterized as in personam or in rem, the Due Process Clause
demands “notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise
interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity
to present their objections.”<a name="_ftnref179"></a><a href="#_ftnref179" id="footnote_number_179">179</a> Thus, even
in actions in rem, current doctrine requires “efforts to provide actual notice
to all interested parties comparable to the efforts that were previously required
only in <i>in personam </i>actions.”<a name="_ftnref180"></a><a href="#_ftnref180" id="footnote_number_180">180</a>
In keeping with this principle, modern rules prescribing the procedure for in
rem forfeiture actions require the government to send personalized notice to
people with known interests in the property.<a name="_ftnref181"></a><a href="#_ftnref181" id="footnote_number_181">181</a></p>

<p>● <i>Jurisdiction.</i> Traditionally,
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was thought to prevent a
state from exercising in personam jurisdiction over an unconsenting defendant
who did not owe allegiance to the state unless the defendant (or an agent
authorized to receive summonses on his behalf) was served with a summons inside
the state’s borders.<a name="_ftnref182"></a><a href="#_ftnref182" id="footnote_number_182">182</a> By contrast,
courts could exercise in rem jurisdiction over property that was located in the
state no matter where any claimants might be found. Again, however, modern
doctrine has narrowed this distinction. In the mid-twentieth century, the
Supreme Court allowed in personam jurisdiction to expand; states can now send
summonses beyond their borders to reach defendants who are not physically
present in the state but who satisfy the “minimum contacts” test.<a name="_ftnref183"></a><a href="#_ftnref183" id="footnote_number_183">183</a>
Conversely, the Court has cut back on the permissible reach of in rem
jurisdiction, or at least quasi in rem jurisdiction.<a name="_ftnref184"></a><a href="#_ftnref184" id="footnote_number_184">184</a>
Because of these twin developments, the outer limits of in rem jurisdiction now
resemble—and may be identical to—the outer limits of in personam
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>● <i>Burden of proof.</i> In the
typical in personam action, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving each of
the elements of his or her cause of action against the defendant. Historically,
the allocation of burdens of proof in actions in rem has been less clear.<a name="_ftnref185"></a><a href="#_ftnref185" id="footnote_number_185">185</a>
Rather than leave the topic in the courts’ hands, early federal customs
statutes that included forfeiture provisions explicitly put the burden of proof
on claimants who contested seizures or denied that property had been forfeited.<a name="_Ref440703771"></a><a name="_ftnref186"></a><a href="#_ftnref186" id="footnote_number_186">186</a> This allocation of the burden of
proof came to be seen as a basic feature of the customs system,<a name="_ftnref187"></a><a href="#_ftnref187" id="footnote_number_187">187</a>
and Congress extended it to other areas too.<a name="_ftnref188"></a><a href="#_ftnref188" id="footnote_number_188">188</a>
In 2000, however, Congress rolled back those extensions. While claimants still
have the burden of proof with respect to forfeitures under customs statutes,
the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 established the following rule
for most other federal statutes: “In a suit or action brought under any
[federal] civil forfeiture statute for the civil forfeiture of any property[,]
. . . the burden of proof is on the Government to establish, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the property is subject to
forfeiture . . . .”<a name="_Ref433526401"></a><a name="_ftnref189"></a><a href="#_ftnref189" id="footnote_number_189">189</a> At least at the federal level, then,
the burden of proof in most in rem forfeiture actions now resembles the burden
of proof that would apply in civil actions in personam.</p>

<p>To be sure, the traditional differences between actions in
rem and actions in personam have not vanished completely. For instance, the
typical action in rem still begins with the seizure of property, while the
typical action in personam does not. In some other contexts, moreover, the
Supreme Court has understood the Due Process Clause to require notice and an
opportunity to be heard <i>before</i> the
government removes property from someone’s possession.<a name="_ftnref190"></a><a href="#_ftnref190" id="footnote_number_190">190</a>
But even as the Court was establishing this doctrine, it recognized an
exception for forfeiture proceedings.<a name="_ftnref191"></a><a href="#_ftnref191" id="footnote_number_191">191</a>
Although the Court has since narrowed this exception so that an adversary hearing
is normally required before the seizure of <i>real</i>
property,<a name="_ftnref192"></a><a href="#_ftnref192" id="footnote_number_192">192</a>
the government’s ability to seize <i>personal</i>
property without prior notice continues to distinguish in rem forfeiture
proceedings from many other civil actions. Even this aspect of current doctrine,
however, is not really about the difference between actions in rem and actions
in personam. In allowing the government to seize movable personal property
without advance notice for purposes of civil forfeiture, the Supreme Court
reasoned that forfeiture proceedings implicate the same considerations that had
justified dispensing with preseizure notice in other contexts.<a name="_ftnref193"></a><a href="#_ftnref193" id="footnote_number_193">193</a>
Those considerations can be relevant whether an action is proceeding in rem or
in personam.</p>

<p>To the extent that the procedures used for actions in rem
have converged with the procedures used for actions inpersonam, it is hard to argue that the Due Process Clause requires
certain types of civil-forfeiture actions to proceed in personam rather than in
rem. After all, if the procedures currently used for civil actions in personam
would be adequate to satisfy the Due Process Clause, and if the procedures
currently used for civil actions in rem supply essentially the same safeguards,
then the mere fact that an action is denominated in rem rather than in personam
should not matter.</p>

<h3>II. civil
versus criminal<a name="ii-civil-versus-criminal"></a></h3>

<p>Where forfeiture is concerned, though, perhaps the procedures
currently used for civil actions in personam are <i>not</i> adequate to satisfy the Due Process Clause. The most
fundamental argument that has been advanced against the constitutionality of civil-forfeiture
statutes is that many of them purport to use civil process to achieve “criminal
law objectives”<a name="_ftnref194"></a><a href="#_ftnref194" id="footnote_number_194">194</a>: they
authorize the government to punish people for violations of the law, but
without the special safeguards that the Constitution requires for criminal
prosecutions. According to many commentators, courts should not permit this end
run around criminal procedure.<a name="_Ref441161517"></a><a name="_ftnref195"></a><a href="#_ftnref195" id="footnote_number_195">195</a> While the details of the
commentators’ arguments vary, the basic idea is simple: legislatures should not
be able to avoid the constitutional safeguards for criminal prosecutions simply
by authorizing the government to impose punishments through nominally “civil”
proceedings.</p>

<p>The modern Supreme Court has struggled with arguments of this
sort. In the words of one thoughtful scholar, the distinction between “civil”
and “criminal” proceedings is one of “the least well-considered and principled
in American legal theory,” and the Supreme Court’s decisions on this topic are
“as incoherent as any in the Court’s jurisprudence.”<a name="_ftnref196"></a><a href="#_ftnref196" id="footnote_number_196">196</a></p>

<p><span>At least where
forfeiture is concerned, though, Part II.A suggests that the incoherence in the
Court’s doctrine did not really emerge until the last two decades of the
nineteenth century. Even today, Part II.B agrees with the late J. Morris Clark
that most of the Court’s seemingly disparate results can be rationalized; there
is an interpretation of the Constitution that largely fits the data points
supplied by modern doctrine, and this interpretation does not foreclose the use
of civil procedure to declare the forfeiture of property, even when the
forfeiture serves the purpose of punishing or deterring forbidden behavior.
Part II.C identifies strong historical support for Professor Clark’s key
insight.</span></p>

<h3>A. The
Path to Current Doctrine<a name="a-the-path-to-current-doctrine"></a></h3>

<p>Early on, the Supreme Court took a clear position about how
to characterize the typical forfeiture proceeding. The Court first discussed
the issue in 1796, in a proceeding that the United States had initiated by
information against a vessel that allegedly had been used to export arms in
violation of federal law.<a name="_ftnref197"></a><a href="#_ftnref197" id="footnote_number_197">197</a> The district
court had decreed a forfeiture, but a circuit court had reversed the decree on
appeal.<a name="_ftnref198"></a><a href="#_ftnref198" id="footnote_number_198">198</a>
Arguing that the matter “is a criminal cause” as to which “the judgment of the
District Court is final,” the United States asked the Supreme Court to hold
that the circuit court had lacked jurisdiction.<a name="_ftnref199"></a><a href="#_ftnref199" id="footnote_number_199">199</a>
But the Supreme Court declared itself “unanimously of opinion, that [this] is a
civil cause: It is a process of the nature of a libel in rem; and does not, in
any degree, touch the person of the offender.”<a name="_Ref424543548"></a><a name="_ftnref200"></a><a href="#_ftnref200" id="footnote_number_200">200</a></p>

<p>The Marshall Court repeatedly took the same position,<a name="_ftnref201"></a><a href="#_ftnref201" id="footnote_number_201">201</a>
as did many other courts.<a name="_ftnref202"></a><a href="#_ftnref202" id="footnote_number_202">202</a> In 1882,
Rufus Waples thus observed that even though actions in rem for forfeiture could
be “based upon criminal offenses committed in, with, or by the things proceeded
against,” such actions “are well settled to be civil, and not, in any sense,
criminal actions.”<a name="_ftnref203"></a><a href="#_ftnref203" id="footnote_number_203">203</a></p>

<p>Yet if this principle was “well settled” in 1882, the Supreme
Court unsettled it just four years later. “We are . . . clearly of
opinion,” the Court announced in <i>Boyd v.
United States</i>, “that proceedings instituted for the purpose of declaring
the forfeiture of a man’s property by reason of offences committed by him,
though they may be civil in form, are in their nature criminal.”<a name="_Ref427510176"></a><a name="_ftnref204"></a><a href="#_ftnref204" id="footnote_number_204">204</a> Although the scope of the Court’s
ruling was uncertain, the Court held that at least some forfeiture proceedings
that are “civil in form” are nonetheless “quasi-criminal,” and should be
treated like criminal proceedings “for all the purposes of the Fourth Amendment
of the Constitution, and of that portion of the Fifth Amendment which declares
that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself.”<a name="_ftnref205"></a><a href="#_ftnref205" id="footnote_number_205">205</a></p>

<p>A decade later, though, the Court reached a different
conclusion about the Sixth Amendment, which lists various rights that “the
accused” shall enjoy “[i]n all criminal prosecutions.”<a name="_ftnref206"></a><a href="#_ftnref206" id="footnote_number_206">206</a>
In <i>United States v. Zucker</i>, the Court
held that this language reaches only proceedings that are “technically criminal
in [their] nature” and “has no reference to any proceeding . . . which is not
directly against a person who is accused, and upon whom a fine or imprisonment,
or both, may be imposed.”<a name="_ftnref207"></a><a href="#_ftnref207" id="footnote_number_207">207</a>
Specifically, <i>Zucker</i> concluded that
the Confrontation Clause did not reach a proceeding that the government had
brought through civil process under the descendant of the same customs statute
that had been at issue in <i>Boyd</i>.<a name="_ftnref208"></a><a href="#_ftnref208" id="footnote_number_208">208</a></p>

<p>The tension between <i>Boyd</i>
and <i>Zucker</i> has carried forward into
more recent cases. Relying on <i>Boyd</i>,
the Warren Court held that just as the fruits of unreasonable searches and
seizures are often inadmissible as evidence in criminal trials, so too they are
inadmissible in the typical forfeiture proceeding; the “object” of both types
of proceedings “is to penalize for the commission of an offense against the
law,” and “the technical character of a forfeiture as an in rem proceeding
against the goods” does not matter.<a name="_ftnref209"></a><a href="#_ftnref209" id="footnote_number_209">209</a>
For much the same reason, the Court continued to classify some civil-forfeiture
proceedings as “criminal case[s]” for purposes of the Self-Incrimination Clause
of the Fifth Amendment.<a name="_ftnref210"></a><a href="#_ftnref210" id="footnote_number_210">210</a> In keeping
with <i>Zucker</i>, though, such proceedings
still do not qualify as “criminal prosecutions” for purposes of the Sixth
Amendment.<a name="_ftnref211"></a><a href="#_ftnref211" id="footnote_number_211">211</a>
Nor do they trigger the special burden of proof that the Supreme Court has read
the Due Process Clause to require for criminal cases: while the government must
prove each element of an offense “beyond a reasonable doubt” in order to obtain
a criminal conviction,<a name="_ftnref212"></a><a href="#_ftnref212" id="footnote_number_212">212</a> this
requirement “does not apply to civil forfeiture proceedings.”<a name="_ftnref213"></a><a href="#_ftnref213" id="footnote_number_213">213</a>
</p>

<p>Under current doctrine, most civil-forfeiture proceedings
also do not trigger the Double Jeopardy Clause. For instance, suppose that
federal law makes certain conduct a crime punishable by imprisonment and,
separately, provides for forfeiture of property used in such conduct (with the
forfeiture to be declared through an action in remagainst the property itself). If the government prosecutes someone
criminally, but he is acquitted, can the government then bring a forfeiture
action against his property based on the same alleged conduct? Although the
Double Jeopardy Clause historically was not understood to bar this course of
proceedings,<a name="_ftnref214"></a><a href="#_ftnref214" id="footnote_number_214">214</a>
divergent views started to emerge around the time of <i>Boyd</i>.<a name="_ftnref215"></a><a href="#_ftnref215" id="footnote_number_215">215</a> In the
twentieth century, the Supreme Court came to think that the answer depended on
whether the forfeiture in question was “punitive” or “remedial.”<a name="_ftnref216"></a><a href="#_ftnref216" id="footnote_number_216">216</a>
Perhaps out of a desire to reach the result that history supported, though, the
Court went to great lengths to characterize particular forfeiture statutes as
“remedial” for this purpose.<a name="_ftnref217"></a><a href="#_ftnref217" id="footnote_number_217">217</a> Eventually,
the Court announced a not-quite-categorical rule: in <i>United States v. Ursery</i>, a case involving the extensive forfeiture
provisions in modern drug and money-laundering statutes, the Court held that
“[t]hese civil forfeitures (and civil forfeitures generally) . . . do
not constitute ‘punishment’ for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.”<a name="_ftnref218"></a><a href="#_ftnref218" id="footnote_number_218">218</a></p>

<p>Just three years earlier, however, the Court’s opinion in <i>Austin v. United States</i> had held that
forfeiture under one of the very same statutes “constitutes ‘payment to a
sovereign as punishment for some offense,’ . . . and, as such, is subject
to the limitations of the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines Clause.”<a name="_ftnref219"></a><a href="#_ftnref219" id="footnote_number_219">219</a>
The majority opinion in <i>Ursery</i>
offered no explanation of why the Double Jeopardy Clause was different, but the
Court nonetheless insisted on the distinction: “The holding of <i>Austin</i> was limited to the Excessive
Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, and we decline to import the analysis of <i>Austin</i> into our double jeopardy
jurisprudence.”<a name="_ftnref220"></a><a href="#_ftnref220" id="footnote_number_220">220</a></p>

<h3>B. The
Perils of Equating “Punitive” with “Criminal”<a name="b-the-perils-of-equating-punitive-with-criminal"></a></h3>

<p>In 1976, just a few years before his untimely death, J.
Morris Clark explained how to make sense of these cases
as a doctrinal matter.<a name="_Ref426027738"></a><a name="_ftnref221"></a><a href="#_ftnref221" id="footnote_number_221">221</a> To do so, “one must temporarily
disregard the Court’s language” and look for a pattern in the Court’s results.<a name="_ftnref222"></a><a href="#_ftnref222" id="footnote_number_222">222</a>
Although the modern Court has sometimes spoken as if laws are either “criminal
and punitive” or “civil and remedial,”<a name="_ftnref223"></a><a href="#_ftnref223" id="footnote_number_223">223</a>
the Court’s outcomes can be rationalized better if one separates the
criminal/civil distinction from the punitive/remedial distinction. Of course,
those distinctions overlap to some extent: some paradigmatic types of
punishment (such as death sentences and prison terms) are inherently criminal.<a name="_ftnref224"></a><a href="#_ftnref224" id="footnote_number_224">224</a>
But if the legislature so directs, certain other types of punishment (including
punitive deprivations of property) can be declared in “civil” proceedings.<a name="_ftnref225"></a><a href="#_ftnref225" id="footnote_number_225">225</a></p>

<p>This clarification matters, because some provisions in the
Bill of Rights refer specifically to criminal cases and do not appear to reach
any civil proceedings (even those involving punishment).<a name="_ftnref226"></a><a href="#_ftnref226" id="footnote_number_226">226</a>
By its terms, for instance, the Sixth Amendment covers only “criminal
prosecutions.”<a name="_ftnref227"></a><a href="#_ftnref227" id="footnote_number_227">227</a> Similar
limitations appear in several provisions of the Fifth Amendment—the Grand
Jury Clause (“No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise
infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand
Jury . . .”<a name="_ftnref228"></a><a href="#_ftnref228" id="footnote_number_228">228</a>), the Double
Jeopardy Clause (“. . . nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to
be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb”<a name="_Ref426976963"></a><a name="_ftnref229"></a><a href="#_ftnref229" id="footnote_number_229">229</a>), and the Self-Incrimination Clause (“.
. . nor shall [any person] be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness
against himself”<a name="_ftnref230"></a><a href="#_ftnref230" id="footnote_number_230">230</a>). With the
exception of the Self-Incrimination Clause (which <i>Boyd</i> arguably misinterpreted), the Supreme Court has generally held
that these provisions do not apply to civil-forfeiture proceedings.<a name="_ftnref231"></a><a href="#_ftnref231" id="footnote_number_231">231</a>
As Professor Clark noted, the most logical explanation of that conclusion is
not that civil-forfeiture proceedings are “remedial” rather than “punitive,”
but simply that they are not “criminal” in the necessary sense.<a name="_ftnref232"></a><a href="#_ftnref232" id="footnote_number_232">232</a></p>

<p>By contrast, some other constitutional provisions are worded
in such a way as to restrict all types of punishment, whether enforced through
criminal or civil proceedings. For these provisions, the criminal/civil
distinction does not matter; instead, the punitive/remedial distinction takes
over. That explains why civil forfeiture is subject to the Excessive Fines
Clause. At least on its face, the Excessive Fines Clause is not limited to <i>criminal</i> punishment,<a name="_ftnref233"></a><a href="#_ftnref233" id="footnote_number_233">233</a>
and the Supreme Court has understood it to restrict fines and forfeitures
imposed through civil process too.<a name="_Ref426969342"></a><a name="_ftnref234"></a><a href="#_ftnref234" id="footnote_number_234">234</a></p>

<p>As Professor Clark suggested, the Ex Post Facto Clauses may
be similar.<a name="_ftnref235"></a><a href="#_ftnref235" id="footnote_number_235">235</a>
Although some modern federal judges take the Supreme Court to have held
definitively that the Ex Post Facto Clauses “appl[y] only to criminal cases,”<a name="_ftnref236"></a><a href="#_ftnref236" id="footnote_number_236">236</a>
that gloss on the Court’s opinions may not be quite right. In the seminal case
of <i>Calder v. Bull</i>,<a name="_ftnref237"></a><a href="#_ftnref237" id="footnote_number_237">237</a>
the Court did treat the phrase “ex post facto law” as a term of art that
connotes the retroactive authorization of punishment. But the Justices’
seriatim opinions did not clearly specify whether the phrase is limited to <i>criminal</i> punishment,<a name="_ftnref238"></a><a href="#_ftnref238" id="footnote_number_238">238</a>
and subsequent courts used formulations that encompass penalties and
forfeitures more broadly.<a name="_ftnref239"></a><a href="#_ftnref239" id="footnote_number_239">239</a> In the
1860s, federal courts gave teeth to the broader idea: in several cases, they
applied the Ex Post Facto Clauses to laws that did not operate through the
criminal process, but that the courts saw as imposing “punishment” for
pre-enactment conduct.<a name="_ftnref240"></a><a href="#_ftnref240" id="footnote_number_240">240</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Supreme Court later glossed these cases as
establishing that “the <i>ex post facto</i>
effect of a law cannot be evaded by giving a civil form to that which is essentially
criminal,”<a name="_ftnref241"></a><a href="#_ftnref241" id="footnote_number_241">241</a>
and the modern Court has continued to muddy the waters by conflating the
punitive/nonpunitive distinction with the criminal/civil distinction.<a name="_ftnref242"></a><a href="#_ftnref242" id="footnote_number_242">242</a>
That has led several lower federal courts to suggest that unless a civil-forfeiture
statute is so “overwhelmingly punitive” that it “must be considered criminal,”
the Ex Post Facto Clauses do not prevent it from operating retroactively<a name="_ftnref243"></a><a href="#_ftnref243" id="footnote_number_243">243</a>—with
the result, apparently, that a statute enacted in 2016 could declare that
property has been forfeited to the government because of how the property was
used in 2015. Professor Clark’s analysis shows the route away from this
conclusion: the distinction that matters to the Ex Post Facto Clauses, as
interpreted by the Supreme Court over the years, is not the criminal/civil
distinction but the punitive/nonpunitive distinction.<a name="_ftnref244"></a><a href="#_ftnref244" id="footnote_number_244">244</a></p>

<h3>C. Historical
Support for the Category of Civil Punishment<a name="c-historical-support-for-the-category-of-civil-punishment"></a></h3>

<p>Professor Clark cast his analysis mostly as a way to make
sense of current judicial doctrine.<a name="_ftnref245"></a><a href="#_ftnref245" id="footnote_number_245">245</a>
But there is considerable historical support for his key insight: not all
punishment is <i>criminal</i> punishment.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many statutes
backed up their requirements by subjecting violators to monetary penalties.<a name="_Ref424315592"></a><a name="_ftnref246"></a><a href="#_ftnref246" id="footnote_number_246">246</a> Lawyers of the day classified such
statutes as “penal.”<a name="_Ref427564305"></a><a name="_ftnref247"></a><a href="#_ftnref247" id="footnote_number_247">247</a> But they did not mean that the
mulcts authorized by these statutes could be recovered only through criminal
prosecutions.<a name="_ftnref248"></a><a href="#_ftnref248" id="footnote_number_248">248</a>
According to Justice Story, indeed, unless the statute “specially allowed” the
use of criminal process, “an indictment [will not] lie for such a penalty.”<a name="_ftnref249"></a><a href="#_ftnref249" id="footnote_number_249">249</a>
Instead, the default process for collecting monetary penalties of this sort was
“an action or information of debt” brought by the government against the person
who had violated the statute (and who therefore was indebted to the government
in the amount of the penalty).<a name="_ftnref250"></a><a href="#_ftnref250" id="footnote_number_250">250</a></p>

<p>An “action of debt,” even to collect a statutory penalty, was
a civil proceeding.<a name="_ftnref251"></a><a href="#_ftnref251" id="footnote_number_251">251</a> So was an
“information of debt,” which again should not be confused with a <i>criminal</i> information.<a name="_ftnref252"></a><a href="#_ftnref252" id="footnote_number_252">252</a>
Like the information in rem, the information of debt was a familiar process in
England’s Court of Exchequer: just as the Crown might file an information in
rem against specific items of property that allegedly had been forfeited, so
too the Crown might file an information of debt against a person who allegedly
owed the Crown a monetary penalty for having violated a statute.<a name="_ftnref253"></a><a href="#_ftnref253" id="footnote_number_253">253</a>
Authorities agreed that this process “is in the nature of a civil action at the
suit of the Crown” and amounted to “the King’s action of debt.”<a name="_ftnref254"></a><a href="#_ftnref254" id="footnote_number_254">254</a>
</p>

<p>When Justice Story wrote that “an action or information of
debt” was the default mechanism for the government to recover a monetary
penalty imposed by statute,<a name="_ftnref255"></a><a href="#_ftnref255" id="footnote_number_255">255</a> he plainly
was referring to civil proceedings. Indeed, even judges who believed that the
government <i>could</i> use criminal process
to collect such penalties agreed that the government rarely did so: “the usual
and almost universal practice, in the courts of the United States, has been to
enforce the payment of pecuniary penalties, given by statute, by civil and not
criminal proceedings.”<a name="_Ref424315656"></a><a name="_ftnref256"></a><a href="#_ftnref256" id="footnote_number_256">256</a></p>

<p>By the mid-nineteenth century, both legislatures and courts
were using the term “civil penalties” as shorthand for such mulcts.<a name="_ftnref257"></a><a href="#_ftnref257" id="footnote_number_257">257</a>
Likewise, courts emphasized that proceedings to recover these penalties were “penal”
but not “criminal.”<a name="_ftnref258"></a><a href="#_ftnref258" id="footnote_number_258">258</a> Admittedly,
there were certain respects in which courts treated penal statutes like
criminal statutes. For instance, interpreters often said that penal as well as
criminal statutes should be “construed strictly,”<a name="_ftnref259"></a><a href="#_ftnref259" id="footnote_number_259">259</a>
and the courts of one sovereign did not feel obliged to entertain proceedings
to enforce either the penal or the criminal laws of another sovereign.<a name="_ftnref260"></a><a href="#_ftnref260" id="footnote_number_260">260</a>
On matters of practice and procedure, though, the penal actions that courts did
entertain generally followed civil rather than criminal rules.<a name="_Ref441155354"></a><a name="_ftnref261"></a><a href="#_ftnref261" id="footnote_number_261">261</a> </p>

<p>Throughout American history, courts have taken a similar
approach to statutes that threatened violators not with monetary penalties, but
with the forfeiture of specific items of property. Early courts regularly
referred to such provisions as “penal”<a name="_ftnref262"></a><a href="#_ftnref262" id="footnote_number_262">262</a>
and as inflicting a species of “punish[ment]” on the property’s owner.<a name="_ftnref263"></a><a href="#_ftnref263" id="footnote_number_263">263</a>
Statutes themselves sometimes used similar language, as when they said that
their requirements applied “on pain of forfeiture” of the property involved in
a violation.<a name="_ftnref264"></a><a href="#_ftnref264" id="footnote_number_264">264</a>
Again, though, penal did not mean criminal. Like informations of debt, the
libels or informations in rem that were used to enforce such forfeitures were
“civil proceedings.”<a name="_Ref427564316"></a><a name="_ftnref265"></a><a href="#_ftnref265" id="footnote_number_265">265</a></p>

<p>Despite the general rule that nineteenth-century courts
applied doctrines of civil procedure in actions of debt for penalties and
proceedings in rem for forfeitures, there were some exceptions. <i>Locke v. United States</i><a name="_Ref442020240"></a><a name="_ftnref266"></a><a href="#_ftnref266" id="footnote_number_266">266</a> may be an early example. There, the
government had filed an eleven-count libel seeking to declare the forfeiture of
a cargo for violations of the Collection Act and some other federal statutes,
and the district court had rendered judgment in the government’s favor.<a name="_ftnref267"></a><a href="#_ftnref267" id="footnote_number_267">267</a>
When the case reached the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Marshall affirmed the
judgment on the strength of one of the counts in the libel, which allegedly
warranted the forfeiture irrespective of the claimant’s objections to the other
counts.<a name="_ftnref268"></a><a href="#_ftnref268" id="footnote_number_268">268</a>
At least according to the Taney Court, Marshall’s conclusion that the judgment
could be affirmed on the basis of just one of the counts reflected the view
that the case was “in the nature of a criminal proceeding.”<a name="_Ref442019127"></a><a name="_ftnref269"></a><a href="#_ftnref269" id="footnote_number_269">269</a> The analogy between penal actions
and criminal prosecutions may also have led judges to require more specificity
in pleadings than standard civil practice would have demanded,<a name="_ftnref270"></a><a href="#_ftnref270" id="footnote_number_270">270</a>
and perhaps to apply a higher standard of proof at trial.<a name="_Ref442019132"></a><a name="_ftnref271"></a><a href="#_ftnref271" id="footnote_number_271">271</a> With rare exceptions, though, even
judges who took this view of penal actions did not cast their position in
constitutional terms.<a name="_ftnref272"></a><a href="#_ftnref272" id="footnote_number_272">272</a> As a result,
people seem to have thought that statutes could validly instruct courts to
treat penal actions like ordinary civil suits.<a name="_ftnref273"></a><a href="#_ftnref273" id="footnote_number_273">273</a></p>

<p>In the first edition of his treatise on criminal law,
published in 1856, Joel Prentiss Bishop did try to identify some constitutional
limitations on the use of civil procedure to enforce statutory forfeitures.
While conceding that “the adjudications on the subject are not numerous,”
Bishop asserted that</p>

<p>a
legislative forfeiture may be so far in the nature of a punishment for crime,
in distinction from a regulation concerning the use of the property, as to
require the proceedings, for its enforcement, to be regulated with a reference
to the guaranties of rights for the protection of persons charged with crime.<a name="_ftnref274"></a><a href="#_ftnref274" id="footnote_number_274">274</a></p>

<p>By 1865, Bishop had developed a more
precise formulation of the distinction that he had in mind. His basic idea, as
expressed in the heading of the relevant chapter in the third edition, was that
forfeiture could proceed outside of the criminal process “where the thing, as
distinguished from its owner, is in the wrong.”<a name="_Ref424287300"></a><a name="_ftnref275"></a><a href="#_ftnref275" id="footnote_number_275">275</a> Thus, “[w]henever the law . . . creates
a forfeiture of property by reason of its circumstances, or of its peculiar
nature as being dangerous to the community,—by reason of any form or
position which it assumes,—this forfeiture is not to be deemed a
punishment inflicted on its owner.”<a name="_Ref441153291"></a><a name="_ftnref276"></a><a href="#_ftnref276" id="footnote_number_276">276</a> By contrast, </p>

<p>if the law provides, that a person shall forfeit
property A for what property B does, or for what the owner does in a matter not
connected with the property, or for a bare intent which does not enter into the
situation and conduct of the property, the forfeiture is a punishment, which
can be inflicted only on conviction of the owner, for the act or intent, viewed
as a crime.<a name="_Ref441153295"></a><a name="_ftnref277"></a><a href="#_ftnref277" id="footnote_number_277">277</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, this analysis risks conflating two separate
questions. One question, addressed in Part I of this Feature, concerns the
circumstances in which actions must proceed in personam against an offender
rather than in rem against property that the offender happens to own. By and large,
Bishop’s position on this question was consistent with traditional practices.
Bishop did not deny that the law can declare the forfeiture of property that is
used in violation of legal restrictions, or that the law can enforce such
forfeitures through proceedings in rem.<a name="_ftnref278"></a><a href="#_ftnref278" id="footnote_number_278">278</a>
His basic point was simply that the law cannot extend this treatment to other
pieces of property that are not at all germane to the violations.<a name="_ftnref279"></a><a href="#_ftnref279" id="footnote_number_279">279</a>
That point does not necessarily undermine the constitutionality of modern
forfeiture statutes, which continue to focus on property connected with a
violation of the law.<a name="_ftnref280"></a><a href="#_ftnref280" id="footnote_number_280">280</a></p>

<p>To the extent that some forfeiture actions must proceed in
personam rather than in rem, though, a second question arises: under what
circumstances must the proceeding take the form of a criminal prosecution
rather than a civil suit? Without focusing specifically on this question,
Bishop arguably assumed that criminal procedure is necessary when the law is
imposing “a punishment” on an individual.<a name="_ftnref281"></a><a href="#_ftnref281" id="footnote_number_281">281</a>
But the long history of civil penalties cuts against any such assumption: from
the beginning of the Republic on, many statutes have punished infractions with
monetary penalties that the government could collect in actions of debt or
other civil proceedings.<a name="_ftnref282"></a><a href="#_ftnref282" id="footnote_number_282">282</a> Bishop did
not attack the constitutionality of those statutes. Nor did he suggest that the
Constitution prevented legislatures from enacting civil-forfeiture statutes for
punitive purposes. To the contrary, he acknowledged that the motivation behind
some such statutes was “the same which pervades our criminal law,” and he did
not assert that this motivation made the statutes unconstitutional.<a name="_ftnref283"></a><a href="#_ftnref283" id="footnote_number_283">283</a></p>

<p>Whatever the details of Bishop’s own views, some
nineteenth-century lawyers did reject the idea that civil process could be used
for punitive purposes. This topic received particular attention in the context
of punitive damages.<a name="_ftnref284"></a><a href="#_ftnref284" id="footnote_number_284">284</a> Dating back
to the eighteenth century, both English and American courts had explicitly
allowed juries to award “exemplary” or “vindictive” damages in certain kinds of
tort cases involving outrageous conduct,<a name="_ftnref285"></a><a href="#_ftnref285" id="footnote_number_285">285</a>
and American judges of the early nineteenth century had described such damages
as a form of punishment.<a name="_ftnref286"></a><a href="#_ftnref286" id="footnote_number_286">286</a> In 1830,
however, Theron Metcalf wrote an article arguing that this common way of
talking was “not true” and “there is nothing punitive in civil actions.”<a name="_Ref429743591"></a><a name="_ftnref287"></a><a href="#_ftnref287" id="footnote_number_287">287</a> According to Metcalf, what courts
had called “vindictive” damages amounted to compensation “for insult,
contumely, and abuse”—misconduct that inflicted genuine harms on
plaintiffs even though those harms did not give rise to an independent cause of
action.<a name="_ftnref288"></a><a href="#_ftnref288" id="footnote_number_288">288</a>
In the 1840s, Simon Greenleaf agreed with Metcalf. Dismissing contrary comments
in judicial opinions as “<i>obiter dicta</i>,”
Greenleaf insisted that no express holding had definitively allowed civil
juries to impose damages for the sake of punishment.<a name="_ftnref289"></a><a href="#_ftnref289" id="footnote_number_289">289</a></p>

<p>As Theodore Sedgwick soon pointed out, though, this reading
of the cases was strained: courts <i>had</i>
upheld the award of genuinely punitive damages in civil actions.<a name="_Ref429294130"></a><a name="_ftnref290"></a><a href="#_ftnref290" id="footnote_number_290">290</a> In 1852, indeed, the federal Supreme
Court asserted that “if repeated judicial decisions for more than a century are
to be received as the best exposition of what the law is, the question will not
admit of argument.”<a name="_ftnref291"></a><a href="#_ftnref291" id="footnote_number_291">291</a> In Justice
Grier’s words, “[b]y the common as well as by statute law, men are often punished
for aggravated misconduct or lawless acts, by means of a civil action, and the
damages, inflicted by way of penalty or punishment, given to the party
injured.”<a name="_ftnref292"></a><a href="#_ftnref292" id="footnote_number_292">292</a></p>

<p>Even if Sedgwick was correct about the case law, some judges
thought that Metcalf and Greenleaf were “right in principle.”<a name="_ftnref293"></a><a href="#_ftnref293" id="footnote_number_293">293</a>
In 1873, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire boldly held that “the idea of
punishment is wholly confined to the criminal law” and that the state
constitution forbade the award of punitive damages in civil cases.<a name="_ftnref294"></a><a href="#_ftnref294" id="footnote_number_294">294</a>
Some other state courts reached similar conclusions in the ensuing decades.<a name="_ftnref295"></a><a href="#_ftnref295" id="footnote_number_295">295</a>
But the majority of state courts refused to go along. While tending to
acknowledge that punitive damages were a form of punishment, most state courts
nonetheless allowed them to be imposed through civil process.<a name="_ftnref296"></a><a href="#_ftnref296" id="footnote_number_296">296</a></p>

<p>If one accepts the constitutionality of genuinely punitive
damages, and if one also accepts the constitutionality of statutes that
threaten violators with “civil penalties” payable to the government (which have
even more solid historical roots than punitive damages), it is hard to maintain
that no form of punishment can ever be imposed through civil proceedings.<a name="_ftnref297"></a><a href="#_ftnref297" id="footnote_number_297">297</a>
If legislatures can establish civil penalties measured in money, moreover, it
is not clear what would categorically prevent legislatures from establishing
civil penalties that entail the loss of some other type of property. Of course,
such exactions are limited by the Excessive Fines Clause and other
constitutional provisions that have been understood to operate in civil as well
as criminal cases. But the mere fact that a particular law uses forfeiture as a
penalty does not automatically make actions to enforce the forfeiture
“criminal” in the constitutional sense. </p>

<h3>III. administrative versus judicial<a name="iii-administrative-versus-judicial"></a></h3>

<p><span>So far, this Feature
has discussed two basic characteristics of civil forfeiture—the fact that
it proceeds </span>in rem<span> and the fact
that it does not afford the procedural protections that the Constitution
requires for criminal cases. In light of historical practice, I have suggested
that neither characteristic makes civil forfeiture unconstitutional. This Part
considers a third aspect of forfeiture law that has less direct historical
support and might seem even more objectionable: both at the federal level and
in many states, property is often declared forfeit without any judicial
proceedings at all. </span></p>

<p><span>Before 1844, the federal
customs statutes required the government to launch proceedings in court
whenever it had seized property that it wanted to be adjudged forfeit.</span><a name="_Ref433818775"></a><a name="_ftnref298"></a><a href="#_ftnref298" id="footnote_number_298">298</a><span>
But in 1844, Congress established a special procedure </span></p>

<p>in all cases of seizure of any goods, wares, or merchandise,
which shall, in the opinion of the collector or other principal officer of the
revenue making such seizure, be of the appraised value of one hundred dollars
or less, and which shall have been so seized for having been illegally imported
into the United States.<a name="_ftnref299"></a><a href="#_ftnref299" id="footnote_number_299">299</a> </p>

<p><span>If
two appraisers agreed that the goods were worth $100 or less, the responsible
customs officials would publish a notice for three weeks in a local newspaper,
describing the goods and the circumstances of their seizure and instructing any
would-be claimants to appear within ninety days.</span><a name="_ftnref300"></a><a href="#_ftnref300" id="footnote_number_300">300</a><span> If anyone filed a claim with the collector
and posted a bond within that period, the collector would hand the matter off
to the United States attorney for the relevant district, “who shall proceed
thereon in the ordinary manner prescribed by law”—that is, by launching
an action </span>in rem<span> in court.</span><a name="_ftnref301"></a><a href="#_ftnref301" id="footnote_number_301">301</a><span> But if no one submitted a timely claim and
posted the required bond, the collector would simply sell the goods at a public
auction.</span><a name="_Ref432856731"></a><a name="_ftnref302"></a><a href="#_ftnref302" id="footnote_number_302">302</a></p>

<p><span>For more than a
century, Congress continued to restrict this administrative procedure to
low-value property. As late as 1978, federal customs statutes authorized
administrative forfeiture only for property worth $2,500 or less.</span><a name="_ftnref303"></a><a href="#_ftnref303" id="footnote_number_303">303</a><span> By 1990, however, Congress had raised the
ceiling to $500,000, and some types of property (including cash) had been
exempted from the ceiling altogether.</span><a name="_ftnref304"></a><a href="#_ftnref304" id="footnote_number_304">304</a></p>

<p><span>Despite increasing
the value of the property subject to administrative forfeiture, Congress has
not given people any more time to file claims and post bonds. In 1866, indeed,
Congress shortened the deadline from ninety days to twenty days,</span><a name="_ftnref305"></a><a href="#_ftnref305" id="footnote_number_305">305</a><span> and the federal customs statutes have
retained that deadline ever since.</span><a name="_ftnref306"></a><a href="#_ftnref306" id="footnote_number_306">306</a><span> The modern customs statutes do require the
government to take more steps to notify interested parties that the clock is
ticking: in addition to requiring notice by publication, current law provides
that “[w]ritten notice of seizure together with information on the applicable
procedures shall be sent to each party who appears to have an interest in the
seized article.”</span><a name="_Ref433381584"></a><a name="_ftnref307"></a><a href="#_ftnref307" id="footnote_number_307">307</a><span>
But interested parties still have only “twenty days from the date of the first
publication of the notice of seizure” to file a claim and post a bond (thereby
prompting the government to launch either civil or criminal forfeiture
proceedings in court).</span><a name="_ftnref308"></a><a href="#_ftnref308" id="footnote_number_308">308</a><span> If no one claims the property within the
twenty-day deadline, “the appropriate customs officer shall declare the vessel,
vehicle, aircraft, merchandise, or baggage forfeited, and shall sell the same
at public auction . . . or otherwise dispose of the same according to
law.”</span><a name="_ftnref309"></a><a href="#_ftnref309" id="footnote_number_309">309</a><span> Ever since 1988, Congress has explicitly
provided that “[a] declaration of forfeiture under this section shall have the
same force and effect as a final decree and order of forfeiture in a judicial
forfeiture proceeding in a district court of the United States.”</span><a name="_Ref445480074"></a><a name="_ftnref310"></a><a href="#_ftnref310" id="footnote_number_310">310</a></p>

<p><span>In the 1970s and
1980s, this method of declaring forfeiture radiated from federal customs
statutes into many other areas, because Congress piggybacked upon the customs
procedures when enacting other forfeiture statutes.</span><a name="_Ref433381605"></a><a name="_ftnref311"></a><a href="#_ftnref311" id="footnote_number_311">311</a><span>
With respect to those other areas, the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of
2000 (CAFRA) has now made it somewhat easier for people to file claims (and
thereby trigger judicial proceedings).</span><a name="_ftnref312"></a><a href="#_ftnref312" id="footnote_number_312">312</a><span> Each federal agency that conducts
administrative forfeitures under statutes covered by CAFRA must “make claim
forms generally available on request,” and those forms must be “written in
easily understandable language.”</span><a name="_ftnref313"></a><a href="#_ftnref313" id="footnote_number_313">313</a><span> CAFRA also gave people more time to file
claims; instead of having only twenty days from the first publication of notice
of seizure, each interested party to whom written notice must be sent</span><a name="_ftnref314"></a><a href="#_ftnref314" id="footnote_number_314">314</a><span> now has at least thirty-five days from the
date that the notice is mailed to him personally.</span><a name="_ftnref315"></a><a href="#_ftnref315" id="footnote_number_315">315</a><span> Likewise, CAFRA eliminated the requirement
that claimants post a bond.</span><a name="_ftnref316"></a><a href="#_ftnref316" id="footnote_number_316">316</a><span> But even after CAFRA, one expert suggests
that as many as eighty percent of federal forfeiture proceedings are
uncontested and are therefore handled administratively.</span><a name="_ftnref317"></a><a href="#_ftnref317" id="footnote_number_317">317</a></p>

<p><span>Critics might
question the constitutionality of ever allowing officials in the executive
branch to issue a conclusive “declaration of forfeiture,” even when the
forfeiture is not contested.</span><a name="_ftnref318"></a><a href="#_ftnref318" id="footnote_number_318">318</a><span> By the very terms of current law, such
declarations operate like judicial judgments.</span><a name="_ftnref319"></a><a href="#_ftnref319" id="footnote_number_319">319</a><span> From one perspective, then, federal statutes
purporting to let customs officers and other administrative officials declare
authoritatively that property has been forfeited might be regarded as an
unconstitutional attempt to vest “judicial” power in executive officials.</span></p>

<p><span>Chief Justice Roberts
arguably lent some credence to this idea in a recent dissenting opinion about
the powers of federal bankruptcy judges. Because those judges lack life tenure
and the other structural protections required by Article III, past cases have
recognized limits on the kinds of claims that Congress can authorize federal
district courts to refer to bankruptcy judges for resolution.</span><a name="_ftnref320"></a><a href="#_ftnref320" id="footnote_number_320">320</a><span> In <i>Wellness
International Network, Ltd. v. Sharif</i>, the majority held that if the
parties consent, bankruptcy judges can be authorized to adjudicate some claims
of the sort that normally require Article III adjudication.</span><a name="_ftnref321"></a><a href="#_ftnref321" id="footnote_number_321">321</a><span> But Chief Justice Roberts disagreed. He
suggested that within the federal government, “the power to ‘render dispositive
judgments’” is “the constitutional birthright of Article III judges”;</span><a name="_ftnref322"></a><a href="#_ftnref322" id="footnote_number_322">322</a><span> with only “narrow exceptions,” Congress
normally cannot authorize federal tribunals that lack the structural safeguards
of Article III to render dispositive judgments adverse to private rights.</span><a name="_ftnref323"></a><a href="#_ftnref323" id="footnote_number_323">323</a><span> According to Chief Justice Roberts,
moreover, even the parties’ explicit consent cannot cure this problem and
justify “the entry of final judgment by a non-Article III actor.”</span><a name="_ftnref324"></a><a href="#_ftnref324" id="footnote_number_324">324</a></p>

<p><span>At first glance, one
might think that current statutory provisions about administrative forfeiture
raise a similar issue. Even if no interested parties object, perhaps Congress
cannot authorize executive officials to issue “declaration[s] of forfeiture”
that have the same legal effect as judicial judgments.</span></p>

<p><span>Of course, Chief
Justice Roberts was writing in dissent, and his analysis might be incorrect
even in the context of bankruptcy cases. In my view, both text and history do
support reading Article III to restrict the types of entities that can exercise
“judicial” power on behalf of the United States.</span><a name="_ftnref325"></a><a href="#_ftnref325" id="footnote_number_325">325</a><span> But when parties consent to let a bankruptcy
judge resolve their dispute, they need not be thought of as purporting to
authorize “an exercise of judicial power outside Article III.”</span><a name="_ftnref326"></a><a href="#_ftnref326" id="footnote_number_326">326</a><span> Instead of trying to confer “judicial power”
on an actor who cannot receive it, the parties might be thought of as simply
waiving their right to insist on an exercise of such power. Just as potential
litigants waive their right to “judicial” adjudication when they opt not to
file a complaint in the first place, or when they settle their claims out of
court, or when they agree to binding arbitration, so too litigants may be able
to consent to abide by the decision of a bankruptcy judge.</span><a name="_ftnref327"></a><a href="#_ftnref327" id="footnote_number_327">327</a><span> In other words, perhaps the power that is
uniquely “judicial”—the power that only true courts can exercise—is
the power to adjudicate and authoritatively resolve disputes about certain
kinds of private rights even <i>without</i>
the consent of the purported right-holder.</span></p>

<p><span>Whatever the proper
analysis of the question presented in <i>Wellness</i>,
though, Chief Justice Roberts’s argument cannot readily be deployed against the
federal laws that currently authorize administrative forfeiture. The essence of
those laws is that when an executive official takes possession of property on
the theory that it really belongs to the government, and when the official properly
causes notice of the seizure to be directed to interested parties, people have
only a limited period of time to dispute the official’s action. If someone
files a timely claim, the laws do not purport to subject that claim to
administrative adjudication; the dispute between the government and the
claimant will instead be adjudicated in court. But if no claimants appear
within the prescribed period, then the laws conclude that there is no dispute
for anyone to adjudicate. Rather than casting executive officials in the role
of judges, administrative-forfeiture laws simply establish a deadline for
contesting the government’s assertion of ownership.</span></p>

<p><span>To be sure, such laws
may sometimes allow the government to obtain clear title to property even
though the responsible executive officials were wrong about the facts and the
property had not really been used in a manner that triggers forfeiture. If
adequate notice is directed to all interested parties, but no one claims the
property within the prescribed period, then title vests in the government even
if the former owner would have had a good basis for contesting the government’s
position. This feature of administrative-forfeiture laws, however, does not
distinguish them from various other statutes that establish deadlines for
asserting legal rights against the government.</span><a name="_ftnref328"></a><a href="#_ftnref328" id="footnote_number_328">328</a></p>

<p><span>Throughout American
history, legislatures have enacted statutes that extinguish property rights
belonging to owners who fail to take certain affirmative actions.</span><a name="_ftnref329"></a><a href="#_ftnref329" id="footnote_number_329">329</a><span> Recording acts have that feature, yet have
long been regarded as unexceptionable.</span><a name="_ftnref330"></a><a href="#_ftnref330" id="footnote_number_330">330</a><span> The same is true of statutes of repose,
which routinely extinguish interests belonging to people who fail to assert
claims within the deadline prescribed by law. The law has long imposed
deadlines for asserting property rights not only in connection with certain
kinds of court proceedings (including probate cases,</span><a name="_ftnref331"></a><a href="#_ftnref331" id="footnote_number_331">331</a><span> bankruptcy cases,</span><a name="_ftnref332"></a><a href="#_ftnref332" id="footnote_number_332">332</a><span> prize cases,</span><a name="_ftnref333"></a><a href="#_ftnref333" id="footnote_number_333">333</a><span> and other proceedings </span>in rem<a name="_ftnref334"></a><a href="#_ftnref334" id="footnote_number_334">334</a><span>), but also in connection with events in the
real world. For instance, title to land can be lost through the failure to
contest someone’s adverse possession</span><a name="_ftnref335"></a><a href="#_ftnref335" id="footnote_number_335">335</a><span> and rights in personal property can be lost
through failure to claim property that the government believes to have been
abandoned.</span><a name="_ftnref336"></a><a href="#_ftnref336" id="footnote_number_336">336</a></p>

<p><span>Administrative-forfeiture
laws do differ from some other statutes of repose in that their clocks are
started by government action. Under modern case law, that feature imposes a
burden on the government to try to identify potential claimants and to send
them personalized notice of the need to act if they want to defend their
alleged interests.</span><a name="_ftnref337"></a><a href="#_ftnref337" id="footnote_number_337">337</a><span> At least at the federal level, though, the
notification procedures required by current administrative-forfeiture laws and
regulations appear to satisfy this requirement.</span><a name="_ftnref338"></a><a href="#_ftnref338" id="footnote_number_338">338</a></p>

<p><span>Of course, even when
personalized notice is directed to all interested parties, Congress presumably
must give those parties a reasonable time to file claims. A statute purporting
to make the executive branch’s determinations conclusive if no one challenges
them within an hour after receiving notice might not differ meaningfully from a
statute purporting to make the executive branch’s determinations conclusive
without permitting any challenges at all. According to longstanding case law,
though, “[a] limitations period is only too short if ‘the time allowed [to file
a claim] is manifestly so insufficient that the statute becomes a denial of
justice.’”</span><a name="_ftnref339"></a><a href="#_ftnref339" id="footnote_number_339">339</a><span> While originalist research may not permit us
to say exactly how short is too short, familiar aspects of current practice
suggest that would-be claimants do not have to be given more than a month to
respond to a personalized notice that the government has seized property and is
planning to declare forfeiture. In judicial proceedings, at least, the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure currently give defendants only twenty-one days after
service of process to serve an answer to the plaintiff’s complaint, upon pain
of default.</span><a name="_ftnref340"></a><a href="#_ftnref340" id="footnote_number_340">340</a><span> If that is presumptively long enough for a
defendant to hire a lawyer, form a position about each of the plaintiff’s
allegations, and identify all relevant affirmative defenses, then a similar
period might be long enough for interested parties to decide whether to claim
property that the government has seized.</span></p>

<p><span>Admittedly, statutes
that let law-enforcement officials seize property on the theory that it now
belongs to the government, and that excuse the government from having to prove
the underlying facts unless the former owner protests, might well be bad ideas.
The more valuable the property, moreover, the more one might think that further
procedural safeguards would be worth their cost. If one were conducting a
cost-benefit analysis in the style of <i>Mathews
v. Eldridge</i>,</span><a name="_ftnref341"></a><a href="#_ftnref341" id="footnote_number_341">341</a><span> one might conclude that the current system
of administrative forfeiture raises substantial risks of erroneous deprivations;
even when no claims are filed, requiring some review of the government’s
position might improve accuracy enough to justify the added expense and delay.
But even under modern procedural-due-process doctrine, the <i>Mathews</i> balancing test does not necessarily govern the
constitutionality of the threshold requirement that someone must file a claim
in order to trigger further procedures.</span><a name="_ftnref342"></a><a href="#_ftnref342" id="footnote_number_342">342</a><span> And if <i>Mathews</i>
does require the government to conduct some additional review even in the
absence of a claim, the added review process would not necessarily have to
occur in court. Whatever additional administrative safeguards the Due Process
Clause might be understood to require, a system that establishes a deadline for
contesting the government’s assertions of ownership, and that enforces the
deadline by giving the government clear title to property that goes unclaimed
despite adequate notice, cannot readily be said to vest “judicial” power in
executive officials.</span></p>

<h3>Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a></h3>

<p>This Feature does not assert, in gross, that all aspects and
all applications of modern forfeiture statutes are constitutional. But the
three central characteristics of modern forfeiture statutes that I have
considered—the fact that civil forfeiture proceeds in rem rather than in
personam, the fact that claimants are not afforded the procedural protections
that they would receive if they were criminal defendants, and the fact that the
government’s assertion of ownership can become incontestable unless an interested
party files a claim within the deadline for doing so—do not violate the
original meaning of the Constitution as liquidated over time.</p>

<p>Still, the conclusion that these characteristics are
constitutional does not mean that they are good.<a name="_ftnref343"></a><a href="#_ftnref343" id="footnote_number_343">343</a>
Media accounts are rife with horrifying stories about how forfeiture laws work
in practice, especially at the local level.<a name="_Ref427510075"></a><a name="_ftnref344"></a><a href="#_ftnref344" id="footnote_number_344">344</a> </p>

<p>We might not muster much sympathy for people who plainly have
committed crimes and who lose some of their property as a result. When criminals
forfeit their ill-gotten gains, or even some of their pre-existing property,
forfeiture laws are serving the useful purpose of “tak[ing] the profit out of
the crime.”<a name="_ftnref345"></a><a href="#_ftnref345" id="footnote_number_345">345</a>
In many ways, moreover, forfeiture is a less costly form of punishment than
incarceration. From the government’s standpoint, indeed, asset forfeiture is a
source of revenue that can help the government fund needed programs without
having to raise taxes.</p>

<p>But that very fact raises dangers, especially when the law
permits enforcement agencies to retain some or all of the money that they raise
through forfeiture.<a name="_ftnref346"></a><a href="#_ftnref346" id="footnote_number_346">346</a> As critics
have noted, letting enforcement agencies augment their own resources through
forfeiture seems likely to affect both enforcement priorities and enforcement
methods. A famous example dates back to the early 1990s: “Florida drug agents
working the I-95 cocaine corridor reportedly try to stop suspected drug buyers
on their way south, while they still have forfeitable cash,” rather than when
they are returning north with drugs that have no value to law-enforcement
agencies.<a name="_ftnref347"></a><a href="#_ftnref347" id="footnote_number_347">347</a></p>

<p>The ease of forfeiture, moreover, must tempt police
departments to use it even when they cannot be sure that a crime has been
committed. For instance, suppose that a police officer stops a car and finds
large amounts of cash. These facts hardly suffice to prove that the driver is
engaged in the drug trade, but they do raise suspicions. The department’s
policymakers, moreover, may encourage officers to act on those suspicions by
seizing the cash and launching the forfeiture process. Departments may reason
that drivers who are indeed involved in the drug trade will walk away from
their cash rather than invite further investigation, while drivers who are
innocent can ultimately get their property back. In this way, departments may
be able to persuade themselves that the forfeiture process will sort the guilty
from the innocent and ensure that justice is done.<a name="_ftnref348"></a><a href="#_ftnref348" id="footnote_number_348">348</a></p>

<p>Seizure on mere suspicion, though, imposes obvious costs on
people who are carrying cash for legitimate reasons. Those people, moreover,
are likely to be disproportionately poor and powerless—people who make
important purchases with cash because they do not have checking accounts, and
who cannot readily hire lawyers to contest the government’s confiscation of their
money.<a name="_ftnref349"></a><a href="#_ftnref349" id="footnote_number_349">349</a>
Every time such people walk away from their property because getting it back
would cost too much, or because they fear that the government will erroneously
charge them with crimes if they fight the forfeiture, the system is wronging
people whom it should be protecting.</p>

<p>Those systemic wrongs would occur even if all police officers
and departmental policymakers were completely honest. But no large-scale
program will be administered perfectly, and there are special dangers in a
large-scale program that asks a disparate set of officers to seize cash and
other hard-to-trace items. To the extent that asset-forfeiture programs invite
corrupt decisions either by individual officers or by departmental
policymakers, the programs’ costs grow. Norms of honest policing are important,
and the temptations created by repeated seizures of cash have some potential to
undermine those norms.</p>

<p>I do not know how to assess the magnitude of any of these
costs, or how to tell whether forfeiture laws have enough offsetting benefits
to justify them. But even after the reforms of the last two decades, it is
certainly possible that forfeiture laws do more harm than good.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the judiciary is not the place for policy
debates of this sort. If legislatures choose to authorize in rem forfeiture
proceedings as a means of enforcing valid statutory restrictions, originalists
should not assume that the Constitution stands in the way.</p>
