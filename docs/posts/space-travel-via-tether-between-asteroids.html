<h3>Space travel via tether between asteroids</h3>
<hr/>
<p>In 1989-1993 I worked on a science fiction novel. I built it around three ideas
that I’d had since college. 1) I was in love with the attributes of a NEO,
“Toutatis”. 2) My college roomate, Tom Phelan, had plunked in numbers for the
estimated gravitational field of a small fast-rotator asteroid (a spherical
cow), and had got a surprising result. Arthur C Clark’s tethers concept was
popular then, but this idea (unlike an earth or moon based launch tether) didn’t
seem to require unobtanium: a 60km launch tether from a small “fast-rotating”
asteroid seemed feasible and would acquire significant delta-v. Perhaps you
could get somewhere else in the Solar System, not just on rockets, but on
centrifical force! 3) Along the way I thought rather deeply about how to build a
network that covered the solar system, leveraging what I understood about
netnews primarily (as Vernor Vinge later did in his marvelous “Fire Upon The
Deep”), as well as trying to adapt the 802.1 MAC protocol to the requirements.
This was in the IPX and OSI era, and IPv6 wasn’t even a thing, in fact, the
future of IP itself was in doubt, and the web, not invented yet. It still seems,
then, and now, to be rather dumb to have to click on things and wait seconds or
minutes for the data to arrive, compared to the idea of just broadcasting
everything of interest and indexing it for search locally. To this day I have
nothing more than a half dozen, half scribbled, short stories set in that
universe. I had more fun designing the plumbing for the asteroid I’d centered
some action in, Toutatis, than the plot.</p>
<p>I play a lot of music while writing these blogs - here’s a favorite about post-orbit-ennui, Ashes to Ashes.</p>

<p>My characters were wooden, my dialog suffered from too much exposition, there
were too many men, the villians too abstract, and I couldn’t write a woman to
save my life. Actually, I reasoned that with suitable sperm banks available,
space didn’t need men at all, so I had a writerly phase where there were nothing
but women in space. All the research to date seems to indicate that pregnancy
cannot happen in zero-g, also, so we would still have use for planets. Toutatis
Needs Women! Neal Stephenson later built on these ideas a bit with his very
depressing Eve.</p>
<p>My vision for how something like humanity would spread through the solar system is closely aligned with Charlie Stross’s “Accellerando” novel, and it doesn’t seem worth my time to work it out further. Despite being seriously outclassed by these wonderful writers, I still think about it often: What would it be really like if humanity spread throughout the solar system? Why go to Mars? The asteroids seem so much easier.</p>
<p>Aside from these few cherished innovations in tethers and communications, in this alternate universe, hinging on an idea that I don’t know is correct, where exploring the solar system was far more like the age of sail, I don’t think I have the chops to tackle the fiction, or the science. My grip on reality is weak enough to not want to spend a year or more living in a fictional future writing a book few would read; the present day is hard enough! These days what little fiction I read is government reports and press releases.</p>
<p>Despite all that writerly ennui, I would really like to find someone competent enough to calculate the stresses on a 60km tether, attached to, any of the now known “fast rotators” - to see if that idea that drove what little plot there was, was actually feasible or not. And then, perhaps, a little bit of n-body simulation, so impossible in the 80s, and so feasible now. Know anyone?</p>
