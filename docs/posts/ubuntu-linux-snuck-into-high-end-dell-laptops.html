Many users, especially developers -- including Linus Torvalds -- love it. As Torvalds recently said, &#34;Normally, I wouldn&#39;t name names, but I&#39;m <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/look-whats-inside-linus-torvalds-latest-linux-development-pc/" rel="follow">making an exception for the XPS 13</a> just because I liked it so much that I also ended up buying one for my daughter when she went off to college.&#34; </p><p>So, how did Dell -- best known for <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/" rel="follow">good-quality, mass-produced PCs</a> -- end up building top-of-the-line <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Ubuntu Linux</a> laptops? Well, Barton George, Dell Technologies&#39; Developer Community manager, shared the &#34;Project Sputnik&#34;   story this week in a presentation at the popular Linux and open-source community show, <a href="https://2023.allthingsopen.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">All Things Open</a>.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-linux-laptop/" rel="follow">The best Linux laptops (and why you might want one)</a></strong></p><p>First, however, you should know that Dell has supported Linux desktops and laptops since the middle 2000s. In 2006, Michael Dell told me that <a href="https://practical-tech.com/2006/03/08/dell-opens-up-about-desktop-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Dell would be the first major PC vendor to release and support desktop Linux</a> -- and this proved to be a success. </p><p>George explained that Dell had always done great volume with these computers. Not volume, like the Windows machines, of course, but enough that Dell has always offered Linux-based -- primarily <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)</a> powered --  workstations.  </p><!----><p>Still, none of these machines really appealed to developers. George explained:</p><blockquote><p> &#34;Back in 2011, a group of us were trying to figure out how Dell could become more relevant to developers. Dell wasn&#39;t a big thing in developers&#39; minds, and we decided it would be a good idea to get developers to change their minds and to think of Dell as a company they wanted to work with.&#34; </p></blockquote><p>This notion had been sparked by a conversation between Dell and Stephen O&#39;Grady, co-founder of the developer-centric analyst firm <a href="https://redmonk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">RedMonk</a>. Barton recalled O&#39;Grady suggesting it would be great for developers &#34;if you took one of your laptops, put Ubuntu on it, and just got it to work. We said that&#39;s an awesome idea, but it&#39;ll never happen, because we&#39;re talking about Dell. Our laptops need to deliver huge volumes and revenue. When I talked to one of our higher-ups about the volumes that we thought we would sell, he said, &#39;Yeah, that&#39;s what we sell in Belgium on Tuesday, between three and four in the afternoon.&#39;&#34; </p><p>Despite this disheartening evaluation, when Dell started an in-house innovation fund, Barton pitched it again. This time, he was granted $40,000 to pursue the idea. &#34;This was enough to get going,&#34; George recalled. &#34;So, first thing, we put together an official team. But none of us were full-time on this. We got approval from their managers to work on this officially, but it was sort of in our spare time.&#34; At times, George said, &#34;The project staff was two people and a dog.&#34;</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-linux-desktops-for-beginners/" rel="follow">The best Linux distros for beginners</a></strong></p><p>George approached Google and Amazon: &#34;&#39;Here&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do,&#39; he related his pitch. &#39;Does this look like something you&#39;d be interested in?&#39; And so while they didn&#39;t place an order there for 10,000 units, they didn&#39;t laugh me out of the room, either.&#34; It was enough to prove there was a business case for a developer-focused Ubuntu Linux laptop.  </p><p>During that same period, George announced on his personal blog what Dell was planning, and his traffic went from 60 views a day to 15,000. Then, as now, there&#39;s a lot of interest in laptops that come with Linux ready to go. </p><p>After all that, the team wanted to ensure they did it right. This wouldn&#39;t just be a case of dumping a distro on a machine and hoping for the best. You can do that today and have an excellent chance of everything working perfectly. In 2013? Not so much. </p><p>George added, &#34;We created a rough image that people could use on the XPS 13. Developers could download it and start working on it. We told people there were a  lot of caveats, and it wasn&#39;t an official release nor supported. But the key thing here is while you couldn&#39;t do this with consumers, with developers -- who knew it was a beta-- then you&#39;re okay. And, we had most of the bugs worked out. The biggest one was the touchpad, which somebody described as &#39;craptastic&#39;.&#34;</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-might-be-your-best-bet-for-heightening-your-desktop-computer-security/" rel="follow">Linux might be your best bet for heightening your desktop computer security</a></strong></p><p>So, Dell got together with <a href="https://canonical.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Canonical</a>, Ubuntu Linux&#39;s parent company, to make sure all the drivers were in place for a top-notch Ubuntu Linux developer desktop experience. Indeed, the name &#39;Project Sputnik&#39; is a nod to Mark Shuttleworth, Ubuntu founder and Canonical CEO. A decade before the project itself, Shuttleworth had spent eight days orbiting the Earth in a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft. George and the crew decided &#34;Soyuz&#34;  didn&#39;t have an inspiring ring to it, so the company went with &#34;Sputnik&#34; instead.</p><p>George continued:</p><blockquote><p> &#34;We announced a beta program for the machine with a 10% off offer. We thought, well, we&#39;ll probably get 300 people. Instead, we got 6,000. This is where senior management said OK, you&#39;ve got something real. We went from slides to launch in nine months. That&#39;s pretty fast for building a system.&#34;</p></blockquote><p>Now, more than a decade later, the <span><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/subid_value/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-plus-developer-edition/spd/xps-13-9320-laptop/usexcucto9320rpl01" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Dell XPS 13 line</span><!----></a></span> and other <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/ubuntu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">other Ubuntu-Linux-powered systems</a> are more popular than ever. From a skunkworks project, George and company created a Linux hardware mainstay for both developers and power users.</p></div></div></div>
