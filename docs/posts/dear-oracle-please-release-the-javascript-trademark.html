Famously Brendan Eich spent only 10 days to create the first
version of JavaScript - a dynamic programming language with a roughly syntactic
lineage from Sun’s Java language. As a result of this partnership Sun held the
trademark “JavaScript”. In 2009 Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and
the JavaScript trademark as a result.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/trademark" title="Read &#34;Dear Oracle, Please Release the JavaScript Trademark&#34;">Read More</a></p></div><div><h3><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/city_worker_exchange_program">City Worker Exchange Program</a></h3><p><time datetime="2022-08-04T00:00:00.000Z">2022-08-04</time></p><p>An international exchange program should be established for workers in local city services to foster the sharing of ideas. There are few opportunities for
local tradespeople to share ideas and techniques outside of their region; the
goal is to fix that.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/city_worker_exchange_program" title="Read &#34;City Worker Exchange Program&#34;">Read More</a></p></div><div><h3><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/javascript_containers">JavaScript Containers</a></h3><p><time datetime="2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z">2022-05-04</time></p><p>The majority of server programs are Linux programs. They consist of a file system, some executable files, maybe some shared libraries, they probably
interface with system software like systemd or nsswitch.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/javascript_containers" title="Read &#34;JavaScript Containers&#34;">Read More</a></p></div><div><h3><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/optimistic_nihilism">Optimistic Nihilism</a></h3><p><time datetime="2017-10-22T00:00:00.000Z">2017-10-22</time></p><p>This post is in response to the Optimistic Nihilism video by
Kurzgesagt. Optimistic Nihilism perfectly describes my perspective on life and
the universe. I want to add my interpretation of the philosophy and spice it up
with some science fiction ideas.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/optimistic_nihilism" title="Read &#34;Optimistic Nihilism&#34;">Read More</a></p></div><div><h3><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/residency">Google Brain Residency</a></h3><p><time datetime="2017-06-06T00:00:00.000Z">2017-06-06</time></p><p>Last year, after nerding out
a
bit on TensorFlow, I applied and was
accepted into the inaugural class of the
Google Brain Residency Program.
The program invites two dozen people, with varying backgrounds in ML, to spend a
year at Google&#39;s deep learning research lab in Mountain View to work with the
scientists and engineers pushing on the forefront of this technology.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/residency" title="Read &#34;Google Brain Residency&#34;">Read More</a></p></div><div><h3><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/colorize">Automatic Colorization</a></h3><p><time datetime="2016-01-08T00:00:00.000Z">2016-01-08</time></p><p>Have you seen Reddit&#39;s /r/colorization sub? People
use photoshop to add color to old black and white photos. This is a good problem
to automate because perfect training data is easy to get: any color image can be
desaturated and used as an example.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/colorize" title="Read &#34;Automatic Colorization&#34;">Read More</a></p></div><div><h3><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/rant">I hate almost all software</a></h3><p><time datetime="2011-09-29T00:00:00.000Z">2011-09-29</time></p><p>It&#39;s unnecessary and complicated at almost every layer. At best I can congratulate someone for quickly and simply solving a problem on top of the shit
that they are given. The only software that I like is one that I can easily
understand and solves my problems. The amount of complexity I&#39;m willing to
tolerate is proportional to the size of the problem being solved.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/rant" title="Read &#34;I hate almost all software&#34;">Read More</a></p></div><div><h3><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/iocp_links">Asynchronous I/O in Windows for Unix Programmers</a></h3><p><time datetime="2011-04-26T00:00:00.000Z">2011-04-26</time></p><p>This document was an attempt at understanding how best to port Node.js to Windows. The result of the port was the library
libuv, which (among other things) provides a
unified interface for asynchronous networking on the three big operating
systems: Linux, OSX, and Windows.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/iocp_links" title="Read &#34;Asynchronous I/O in Windows for Unix Programmers&#34;">Read More</a></p></div></div></div>
