        <div><p>SAGUACHE â€” In southern Colorado, Dean Coombs operates the last linotype newspaper, fighting with and fixing up the the century old typesetting machine everyday in order to put out his family&#39;s paper week after week and year after year.</p><p>The linotype is/was a hot lead <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Linotype" data-cms-ai="0">typesetting machine</a> that creates lines of type that are then stacked and properly arranged in order to form a sort of &#34;metal stamp&#34; which is then used to print a newspaper. </p><p>The linotype was invented in the late 1800s and quickly started seeing widespread usage among newspaper companies. The machine stayed situated as a prominent form of typesetting in the industry through the 1970&#39;s, before being supplanted by newer technology.</p><p><span data-video-disable-history="">

</span></p><p>Now, linotype newspapers are gone in the United States, fully extinct except for the Saguache Crescent, a small publication in Southern Colorado that&#39;s operated by one man. </p><p>&#34;Well,&#34; commented Dean Coombs, owner and operator of the Crescent, &#34;there&#39;s an emotional connection, it&#39;s a family business, I don&#39;t really like change, so you can see why the crescent has not changed.&#34;</p><p>Dean runs the Crescent, working each day to keep his more-than-100-year-old machine operational so that he can keep publishing his weekly newspaper. </p><p>It&#39;s a daily struggle that comes with its own emotional journey. </p><p>&#34;A 100-year-old linotype has problems. And when that problem occurs, you are dead in the water. You are done,&#34; he explained, &#34;so, you have to go from there to not utter despair but some real concern, and then you fix it and the clouds open up and sun shines, that&#39;s a real thing.&#34;</p><p>It&#39;s been described as a grind and Dean is inclined most people would think of it as a drudge but he doesn&#39;t think of it that way. </p><p>&#34;It would be hard for almost anybody else because it takes so much of your time. It just doesn&#39;t leave leftovers for your hobbies and everyone has something else they want to do besides work.&#34;</p><p><span data-video-disable-history="">

</span></p><p>The Crescent was purchased by Dean&#39;s grandparents in 1917; from that point forward they worked the paper, then his parents worked the paper, and now he works the paper. </p><p>He recalls never having missed an issue in the more than 40 years he&#39;s been publishing, even when his father passed in 1978, the family still put the paper out on time. </p><p>&#34;The paper has to come out,&#34; he commented, &#34;it&#39;s just a requirement.&#34;</p><p>It&#39;s an essential function of Saguache, according to Bill Hazard, a man whose family has lived in the town of about 500 since the late 1800s. </p><p>&#34;A small town doesn&#39;t have a lot but it has the newspaper,&#34; he commented, &#34;there&#39;s a lot of people here that still don&#39;t have computers, still don&#39;t have internet, the only way they know something is happening or know something is going on is through the Crescent.&#34;</p><p>Dean looks at the paper as an obligation but also it&#39;s just simply what he does, &#34;You&#39;ve got to be doing something,&#34; he comments.</p><p>According to Dean, the old technology doesn&#39;t freak him out and he doesn&#39;t feel the need to change or upgrade; the machine still does what he needs it to do. </p><p>&#34;The people&#39;s need for change, which is just natural [and] normal, I just don&#39;t have that really,&#34; stated Dean, &#34;so, I just go put out the next newspaper.&#34;</p><p>The paper is largely filled with news on events, legal publications, obituaries, opinion pieces and the like, and whatever else folks bring into his business. </p><p>&#34;Pretty much whatever people want in the paper,&#34; he commented.</p><p>He explains that he relies on folks bringing him stories, his main job is the typing, printing, and upkeep portion of the Saguache Crescent. </p><p><span data-video-disable-history="">

</span></p><p>Dean doesn&#39;t have kids and doesn&#39;t currently have any plans to bring on additional help or train up a successor; when we asked if someone will take over the Crescent once he finally retires, which he doesn&#39;t expect to happen any time soon, he said that he wouldn&#39;t recommend it. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s just all-consuming, nobody really wants to do that,&#34; he commented, &#34;well, a few people do; I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m all-consumed with it, but that&#39;s how I can do it.&#34;</p><p><span data-video-disable-history="">
