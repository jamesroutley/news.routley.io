&#34;When young people ask me about the law as a career,&#34; said one
litigator, &#34;I tell them that in this country whom they choose to have
sex with and where they have sex will have a bigger effect on their
income than whether they attend college and what they choose as a
career.&#34; -- <a href="http://www.realworlddivorce.com"><cite>Real World
Divorce</cite></a>, Introduction

<h3>How to Get Rich</h3>

<blockquote>
&#34;There are three ways to make money.  You can inherit it.  You can marry
it.  You can steal it.&#34;</blockquote>

A young man asked an old rich man how he made his money.  The old guy
fingered his worsted wool vest and said, &#34;Well, son, it was 1932.  The
depth of the Great Depression.  I was down to my last nickel.  I
invested that nickel in an apple.  I spent the entire day polishing the
apple and, at the end of the day, I sold the apple for ten cents.  The
next morning, I invested those ten cents in two apples.  I spent the
entire day polishing them and sold them at 5 pm for 20 cents.  I
continued this system for a month, by the end of which I&#39;d accumulated a
fortune of $1.37.  Then my wife&#39;s father died and left us two million
dollars.&#34;

<p>

Most people who are rich chose their parents wisely.  <a href="http://www.webho.com/WealthClock">Bill Gates</a> might not have
ever figured out 1960s-style computer science but he had the foresight
to pick a father who is one of the richest, most prominent lawyers in
the state of Washington.  And before he and Paul Allen made the deal
with IBM that gave them a monopoly on the PC operating system, Bill had
the foresight to choose a mother who was personally acquainted with John
Opel, CEO of IBM Corporation.  None of this would have worked if Bill
hadn&#39;t been willing to take tremendous personal risks.  Should Microsoft
have failed, of course, Bill Gates would have had nothing to fall back
on but a million dollar trust fund from his mother&#39;s parents (bankers)
and the resumption of his degree program at Harvard College.

</p><p>

If Donald Trump had taken the millions he inherited from his father and
put it all into mutual funds, you&#39;d never have had to suffer through one
of his books.  But he&#39;d be just as rich or richer today.

</p><p>

For most of the 20th century, common stocks returned an average
of 7 percent per year, adjusted for inflation.  If you are way
smarter, luckier, and less risk-averse than all of the companies in
the United States, you may be able to do substantially better.  But a
return on investment of 200 percent per year is not very exciting when
you only have a few hundred dollars in capital.  That&#39;s why it is so
important to pick your parents carefully.


</p><h3>How to Lose it All</h3>

&#34;Death, Disease, and Divorce are the big wealth destroyers,&#34; is an old
saying in the financial services industry. You can&#39;t do much about
death and disease but you can significantly reduce your chances of
being divorced, and the costs and pain associated with divorce, by
choosing your state of residence wisely. You could have a
Massachusetts divorce that costs $1 million in legal fees and $2
million in child support payments results in a near-total loss of
contact with children. That would be a $50,000 divorce in Arizona or
Delaware with 50/50 shared parenting and minimal child support
payments. See <a href="http://www.realworlddivorce.com"><cite>Real
World Divorce</cite></a>.


<h3>Common Stocks and the Efficient Market Hypothesis</h3>

Suppose somehow that you collect a non-negligible amount of cash and
want to invest it.  If you are investing for the long-haul, then common
stocks are your only reasonable choice since they offer the best return.
According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, all stocks are fairly
valued because everyone on Wall Street has the same information.  So
unless you have friends who will give you insider information, there is
no reason that you should buy Microsoft rather than General Motors.
Sure, Microsoft has a monopoly and GM doesn&#39;t, but Microsoft&#39;s monopoly
is already reflected in their lofty price/earnings ratio and GM&#39;s
perennial engineering and management problems are already reflected in
their absurdly low price/revenue ratio.

<p>

If you buy into the Efficient Market Hypothesis then you&#39;re just as
happy to buy a portfolio of stocks selected by throwing darts at the
inside pages of the Wall Street Journal.  In fact, the WSJ for many
years pitted expert wall street analysts against a dartboard portfolio
and the darts almost always did better.  If you don&#39;t have very much
money, then a problem with a dartboard portfolio is that you will only
be able to buy a few stocks.  Your expected return will still be
7 percent per year but the variance will be extremely high because one company
going bust could wipe out all of your gains.

</p><h3>Mutual Funds</h3>

Here&#39;s where Wall Street professionals step in, eager to help you.  If
you don&#39;t like all that risk, join our mutual fund, the Chump Fund.  You
give us $10,000 and we&#39;ll give you a share in our $10,000,000 portfolio
with lots of different stocks, all chosen by Harvard MBAs.  We&#39;ll skim
2% off the top every year to pay for our office space, salaries,
computers, and mailing out advertisements to other people like yourself.
You might not like paying the 2%, but look at how much better we&#39;ve done
than the S&amp;P 500 index over the last five years.

<p>

So you buy into the Chump Fund.  Halfway through the year, the Harvard
MBAs are tired of their drab offices and Pentium computers.  Do they
take part of the 2% and move uptown and then buy Pentium Pros?  No.
They discover all of a sudden that they shouldn&#39;t have any General
Electric.  Westinghouse is really a better investment.  And Ford is
looking better than Chrysler now too.  In fact, the entire $10,000,000
portfolio needs to be traded.  Do your mutual fund managers, who&#39;ve
sworn to look out for your best financial interests, execute the trades
with the broker who has the lowest commissions?  No.  After all, the
money for trading commissions comes out of your 98% and not their 2%
(read the fine print).  So why not go to a &#34;full-service&#34; broker with
high commissions?  That broker will be so grateful that he&#39;ll discover
he has a whole bunch of office space uptown that he isn&#39;t using, already
equipped with a bunch of Pentium Pros.  He&#39;d be delighted to allow his
best customers at the Chump Fund to hang out rent-free.

</p><p>

In your naivete, you might call this a kickback but in the industry it
is known as &#34;soft money.&#34;  Every time the Chump Fund trades with a
broker, they accumulate some soft money that they can spend on
computers, furniture, data feeds, etc.  This comes on top of the opera
tickets, broadway shows, limousines, and the rest of the Wall Street
lifestyle that is paid for by Mr. and Mrs. Middleamerica.

</p><p>

If the Chump Fund keeps on doing this, eventually their return will be
much lower than the S&amp;P 500 and they won&#39;t be able to run those
nice-looking advertisements anymore.  What do they do?  Look among the
20,000 tiny little mutual funds out there.  Find one that has randomly
achieved above-average performance for the past five years.  Call it the
Chump Growth and Income Fund and run ads showing its past performance.
Send letters to all the old Chump Fund customers telling them that the
Chump Fund is being closed and, unless they object, their investments
will be rolled into the new Chump Growth and Income Fund as of September
1.

</p><p>

An even better strategy for a mutual fund company is to do all of this
in-house.  If they have 50 mutual funds they can just hang onto the ones
that randomly do better than average and flush the ones that do
noticeably worse.  Then at any time they can show that &#34;45 out of our 50
funds outperform the indices&#34;.  Now you know why you can&#39;t find any
mutual funds advertised in the Wall Street Journal that sport
worse-than-average performance.

</p><p>

OK, so you expected to get cheated a bit by these Wall Street types.
But they&#39;re experts so of course they will do a better job picking
stocks, won&#39;t they?  Some will.  But with tens of thousands of mutual
funds out there, even if they are all choosing stocks at random, you&#39;d
expect some to do consistently much better than average and some to do
consistently much worse.  You&#39;d find, however, that most of them would
fall in the middle, forming a Gaussian curve.

</p><p>

That&#39;s what Burton Malkiel expected to find.  He was an economics
professor at Princeton who made his life&#39;s work the study of investment.
When he charted the performance of all the mutual funds, they did indeed
form a bell curve.  But the center was not the same as the S&amp;P 500.  It
was shifted slightly to the left.  That&#39;s right, the average mutual fund
was underperforming the blind index by a couple of percentage points.
This confused Malkiel until he realized that the discrepancy could be
accounted for by the expenses skimmed off the top of the mutual funds
and also the commissions they paid to trade the portfolio.  [Note: these
curves are published in Malkiel&#39;s excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393320405/pgreenspun-20">A
Random Walk Down Wall Street</a>, an essential book to read before
investing.]


</p><h3>Index Funds</h3>


Anyway, the long and the short of it is that the index outperforms 85
percent of actively managed mutual funds.  This is an argument for
buying a dartboard portfolio or, if you don&#39;t like the volatility, an
index fund.  One of the first companies to offer these funds was <a href="http://www.vanguard.com/">
Vanguard</a>.  I have been a Vanguard customer for many years and have
been mostly satisfied.  Here are the main problems with Vanguard:

<ul>

<li>poorly programmed Web site: (1) tax forms are offered only in a
bizarre Adobe format that cannot be saved, printed, or emailed to an
accountant, (2) terrible internal email system that simply throws away
your message if you spend too long composing it

</li><li>customer service that gets worse as you get richer; the folks who
answer the phone for the $15,000 IRA crowd are very well informed, can
get you the necessary forms or information, and can help you with a
transaction; if you get rich enough to be upgraded to Flagship ($1
million+), you get assigned the Vanguard equivalent of a private banker;
mine was unable to send email, pick up the phone, send me the right
paperwork to get transactions accomplished, keep focus on getting a
transaction through.  It was dangerous to be a Flagship customer because
I thought that someone at Vanguard was going to make something happen
when in fact he was just sitting at his desk waiting for me to call him.
The solution is to downgrade from Flagship back to Voyager or Voyager
Select.

</li></ul>

<p>

Besides getting a higher average return, there are many other good
reasons to invest your money in index funds.  The first is
psychological.  When I had individual stocks, every time a stock went
up, I attributed it to luck.  Every time a stock went down, I attributed
it to idiocy on my part.  I felt dumber and dumber with every passing
year because I ignored the stocks that went up and focussed on the ones
that dived.  Some Wall Street types have the opposite psychology:  they
only remember their winners and hence come to think of themselves as
Einsteins after five years.  Whatever your psychology, there is a
certain inner peace to be achieved by forgetting about your money.

</p><p>

Another reason to index is to free up time to make more money.  In every
office there is at least one sorry loser checking the market every ten
minutes, going home at night to read financial reports, running charts,
and buying software to manage his complex portfolio.  If he were a
managing a $10 billion mutual fund, perhaps this effort would be worth
it.  But to try to beat the index by 2% with a portfolio of $50,000?
That&#39;s $1,000 extra/year.  Even assuming that he can get that extra 2%,
he would have earned far more per hour working the night shift at the
local 7-Eleven.  Your time is valuable.  If you must be greedy,
then be greedy and smart and take a consulting job.  Or enjoy the extra
time with your friends and family.  Don&#39;t waste it trying to beat the
market.

</p><p>

I have oversimplified things a bit here.  For example, even if you
believe the Efficient Market Hypothesis, there are stocks that are
inherently more volatile than others.  E.g., a high-tech company will go
up more in a market boom and go down more in market bust than will a
utility.  In some sense, both are &#34;worth their price&#34; but one or the
other might be a better buy for you because of your level of risk
aversion.  If you want to understand this stuff at a deep level,
read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393320405/pgreenspun-20">A
Random Walk Down Wall Street</a> and then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070074178/pgreenspun-20">
Principles of Corporate Finance </a> by Brealey and Myers.  The latter
book is the textbook used in many advanced finance course taken by
MBAs.  An MBA student will spend the entire term going through the book
and doing problems, but if you have a standard MIT freshman math and
science background, you can read the whole thing in a night or two.

</p><p>

If I haven&#39;t convinced you to stay away from Wall Street esoterica,
here are a few things I&#39;ve learned through bitter personal experience
and/or reading the above books...

</p><h3>Shorting</h3>

It is 1986.  You buy yourself an IBM PC.  You are using MS/DOS and say
&#34;This sucks.  It isn&#39;t even as good as operating systems from 1960.&#34;
You&#39;re a computer expert so you know that the technology is pathetic.
You do some business research and find that out that the company making
this MS/DOS product didn&#39;t even have the in-house expertise to build it
itself.  They bought it from another company!&#34;  You call your broker and
find out that this &#34;Microsoft&#34; company is publicly traded and selling
for a very lofty price/earnings ratio.  You smell blood and say &#34;I want
to short 100 shares of Microsoft.&#34;

<p>

Your broker is holding many shares of Microsoft in &#34;street name&#34; for
other customers.  So he can very easily find 100 shares of Microsoft to
lend you.  He lends you these 100 shares, and you sell them immediately.
Suppose that the price/share is $10.  You get $1000 that you can put
into the bank.  However, you owe your broker 100 shares of Microsoft
Corporation.  No problem, you figure.  In another year, this company
will be near bankruptcy and selling for $0.25/share.  You&#39;ll buy 100
shares to cover the short for $25, thus making a profit of $975 less
commissions.

</p><p>

Well, in another year, Microsoft is not selling for $0.25/share.  In
fact, it has gone up to $30/share.  You still owe the broker 100 shares,
but those 100 shares would cost $3000 to buy.  You have a paper loss of
$2000 right now.  Your broker calls and wants you to put up some assets
where he can get at them, either cash or stocks.  He doesn&#39;t trust you
to come up with the cash to cover your Microsoft short unless the cash
is physically under his control.  You consider cutting your losses by
closing your position.  Remember that it is 1987, though, and Microsoft
hasn&#39;t gotten any better at writing software.  In fact, they are
flailing around trying to copy the Apple Macintosh interface, itself a
copy of a Xerox system from the mid-1970s.  What a bunch of losers.  You
put up the extra cash.

</p><p>

By 1996, Microsoft has split a bunch of times and you now owe your
broker 1000 shares at $150/share.  That&#39;s $150,000 to cover the short.
You sell your house and say &#34;You know, that potential return of $1000
was not worth ten years of agonized scanning of the stock pages, margin
calls, and an ultimate loss of $150,000.&#34;

</p><p>

There are many morals to this story.  One: stocks go up 7%/year,
adjusted for inflation.  If you buy stocks randomly you will earn
7%/year.  If you short stocks randomly, you will lose 7%/year.  Two: you
are not smarter than the rest of the world put together and, even if you
were, the 14% bias would kill you.  Three: if you buy a stock, you can
only lose what you put in; if you short, you can lose every dime that
you have in the world (and maybe a little bit more depending on how
careful your broker is).

</p><p>

You might think my story is biased because I&#39;ve picked a famous winner
like Microsoft.  But the fact is even stocks that were nothing but hot
air often went up dramatically for years.  If a company&#39;s book value is
$10 million but Wall Street is willing to pay $500 million then there is
no reason why Wall Street shouldn&#39;t be willing to pay $750 million for
the same near-worthless entity.  You are perhaps right and eventually
the stock will crash down towards the $10 million mark, but it could
take many years of sleepless nights.

</p><p>

[Note:  I&#39;ve made one big oversimplification here.  You may get to
invest the proceeds from a short in other stocks and your broker will
invest some of your margin capital in T-bills so your expected return on
a short will not be as bad as -7%.  Still, the unlimited downside is
still present with any short sale.]

</p><h3>Options</h3>

If you have been picking through a company&#39;s Dumpster and know that they
are about to tank, then you might be tempted to short the stock.
Perhaps after reading the above, you are nervous about shorting.  For
you, Wall Street has developed options.  A broker will sell you the
right to sell Blatzco Inc. for $100/share through June 30.  This is
called a &#34;Put Option&#34;.  Perhaps Blatzco Inc. is selling for $100/share
right now.  The option will then cost you perhaps $2.  If Blatzco
Inc. is still selling for $100/share on June 30 then your option is
worth nothing and you lose your entire investment.  If Blatzco Inc. has
crashed to $30/share then your option is worth $70/share.  You&#39;ve made
35 times your money!

<p>

If it sounds like Vegas to you then you&#39;ve already figured out the worst
thing about options:  they appeal to people who like gambling and
therefore tend to be overpriced.  They are best used when you know
something that almost nobody else does and when that something will
affect a company on a specific date.

</p><p>

Note:  there are &#34;Call Options&#34; as well.  These give you the right to
buy a specific stock on a specific date at a specific price.  They are
used when you expect a stock to go way up.

</p><h3>The Fly in the Ointment</h3>

From reading the foregoing, it seems safe to conclude that any investor
can succeed merely by dumping money in an S&amp;P 500 index fund and
forgetting about it.  A lot of folks apparently thought this way and the
result was the massive bubble stock market of the late 1990s.  If
everyone wants to buy something the price of that thing will go up.  The
Dow went from less than 2000 in 1987 to nearly 12,000 in 2000.  Were
American companies really worth 6 times as much 13 years later?
Historical price-earnings ratios for common stocks have averaged 15.  At
the peak of the late 1990s bubble, P/E ratios reached 42.  With the Dow
at 8000 (July 2002) the ratio is about 25, i.e., an investor is paying
$25 for every expected $1 in corporate earnings.  This would seem to
limit the expected return in a common stock to 4% per year.

<p>

Making matters worse is the fact that corporate managers and accounting
firms have been fraudulently overstating earnings.  The published P/E
ratios are based on the lies that CEOs and CFOs tell investors, not the
actual cash coming into companies&#39; bank accounts.  

</p><p>

A deeper problem than fraudulent reporting is managerial theft.
Investors have accounting firms and the SEC to protect them but the top
managers have their hands on the company checkbook and their friends on
the Board of Directors.  In the old days if a company did well the
managers would send a letter to shareholders: &#34;The economy was booming
last year and Blatzco prospered; your dividend is being doubled.&#34;  In
the 1980s and 1990s a more typical response to a boom year was
management saying &#34;Blatzco did well because we&#39;re such geniuses; we are
going to take home all of the improved profit in the form of bonuses and
stock options.&#34;  Jack Welch in <cite>Straight from the Gut</cite>
proudly states that during his 20 years as General Electric CEO the
&#34;employees&#34;, by which he means himself and some other top managers, went
from 0% to 31% ownership of GE.  Rephrased, Jack and his golf partners
stole 31% of GE from the investors who owned the company in 1980.
What&#39;s more, thanks to accounting rules that enable unlimited stock
option grants without any charge to earnings, none of this had to be
reported in financial statements.  My cousin used to be an animator at
Walt Disney.  In the old days of Hollywood a boom and bust cycle of
profits was to be expected.  It is tough to predict whether a movie will
be a hit.  But after Michael Eisner joined the company in 1984 successes
were attributed to superior management rather than luck.  Eisner helped
himself to more than $1 billion of the shareholders&#39; money over the
years.  Thus when Disney ran into a string of flops the company didn&#39;t
have enough cash to hang on until the next boom.  Disney shut down its
Los Angeles animation group and will use contract labor in Eastern
Europe for future animated features.

</p><p>

It is tough to see how historically high rates of return on common
stocks can be maintained in a world where managers steal most of the
fruits that stem from the investors&#39; capital.

</p><p>

<i>Note that the 1980s and 1990s CEOs stealing from their investors are
not innovators.  Leland Stanford and his partners in the Central Pacific
Railroad managed to steal a fabulous sum of money from their British
investors by contracting the construction of the railroad to a company
that they owned personally.  It was a very similar scam as that pulled
off by the managers of Enron except that Stanford did it in the 1860s.</i>


</p><h3>Bonds</h3>

Until management began stealing everything from investors, everyone
hated bonds.  Bonds have historically offered a much lower return
than equities at somewhat reduced risk.  The old theory was that bonds
were good for people about to retire or who otherwise couldn&#39;t afford
the risk of a crash.  However, there is still some capital risk with
bonds.  If inflation goes way up, interest rates will go way up and the
value of &#34;a promise of money in the future&#34; (a bond) will go way down.
A 1990s Wall Street wizard worried about a crash would buy &#34;protective
puts&#34; on the S&amp;P 500 index.  These are deeply out-of-the-money options
that won&#39;t be worth anything unless there is a big crash.  Thus they
will be very cheap though 99% of the time you&#39;ll end up writing off your
entire investment in them.

<p>

What brought bonds back into fashion was the realization that corporate
top management was stealing on a grand scale.  If a company had a bad
year, the CEO somehow had to manage on his $1.2 million cash salary.  If
a company had a good year, the CEO would steal any profits by
exercising stock options that he and his buddies on the board had
previously issued to themselves.  With bonds the company borrows $1 and
has to pay back that $1 plus interest.  If in the meantime the managers
have stolen everything that they can from the shareholders that
shouldn&#39;t affect the bondholders.

</p><h3>Taxes</h3>

It is impossible for a layperson to keep up with all of the latest
wrinkles in the tax code. You&#39;ll want to have an accountant to keep
you informed about the massive tax implications of various ways to
structure transactions. Remember that an accountant is not a
bookkeeper.  An accountant sets up systems, e.g., &#34;You want to set up
a corporation to collect your consulting revenue and then have the
corporation pay you royalites on software that you&#39;ve already
developed.  That way you escape 14% self-employment tax.&#34;  A
bookkeeper takes a stack of checks or credit card bills and
categorizes them into Legal, Advertising, Travel, etc. so that you can
fill out all of those lovely IRS forms.

<h3>The Future</h3>

&#34;This time it is different.&#34; Well, maybe the 21st century of the
U.S. stock market really is different. So much capital has flooded in
that P/E ratios are high by historic standards and it is tough to see
how the real (inflation-adjusted) returns of the 20th century will be
obtainable going forward. Certainly investors in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security#TIPS">TIPS</a>
who accept 1-2% after-inflation yields don&#39;t seem to be expecting safe
and easy higher returns in the stock market.

<center><h3>Reader&#39;s Comments</h3></center>
	<blockquote>
		After working for a few years there (albeit as a
lowly programmer), I feel somewhat qualified to
comment on the casino known as Wall Street. I like
your somewhat accurate description of &#34;soft money&#34;,
but don&#39;t totally agree with your conclusions on
investing philosophy.  I&#39;ve read the Random Walk
book, and I&#39;ve also read Warren Buffett&#39;s book
on &#34;value&#34; investing.  Most people are probably
better off following your advice and sticking with
an index fund, but do you realize what would happen
if everyone did that?  Think about it.... Warren&#39;s
recommendations are very interesting. 

<p>

Those who are interested in learning more about
Wall Street are encouraged to read &#34;Liar&#39;s Poker&#34;
and &#34;Nightmare on Wall Street&#34;, which both happen
to be about Salomon Brothers.

<blockquote>
		Hey, it&#39;s great to see someone exposing mutual funds.
Very few beat the index.

<p>

There is an alternative, a clever way of investing directly.
Read about the Motley Fool (www.fool.com).
This web site will give you the confidence and information to invest successfully.

		</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
		Wish I&#39;d read your page before I spent all that 
money on an MBA . . .  Good commentary, and good 
advice for most investors.  But a lot of people 
like to pick stocks.  Buy and hold index investing 
doesn&#39;t sound exciting at a cocktail party!  Much 
better to talk about your triumphs, and to ignore 
your defeats.

		</blockquote>
<blockquote>
		You are right about Oppenheimer being a bunch of sharks. 
Back in my youth about four years ago I decided it would be responsible to invest my money rather than having it simply stagnate in my checking account. I figured (being an idiot) the way to do this was to visit a securities firm and ask for advice. The guy I spoke to seemed decent enough, asked a bunch of questions, and recommended I invest in five different Oppenheimer mutual funds. I did so and let the whole thing aside. 
Then about a year ago I landed up reading a copy of Andrew Tobias&#39; _The Only Investment Guide You&#39;ll Ever Need_. Fired up with enthusiasm, I looked at my Oppenheimer statements to learn that, in the greatest bull market in history, these people had made me maybe 4% return in 3 years. 
(And the reason for this sort of thing is as Phil says---kickbacks, huge &#34;management fees&#34;, huge advertising budgets, a constant impulse to churn stocks simply to create the illusion of business etc).

<p>

There are a few morals here. 

</p><p>

One is that Oppenheimer suck. 

</p><p>

A more general one is almost everyone in the finance business is out to screw you, and just because they have nice offices and call themselves financial consultants does not mean that they care about you, or that they have any idea what they are doing.

</p><p>

The most general message is, before investing a cent, READ A BOOK. If you are going to read only one book, IMHO read the Tobias book I mentioned above. 

</p><p>

If you refuse to read even one book, invest in a  Vanguard fund; unlike Oppenheimer and friends they will try to do good by you. The Vanguard prospectuses are a joy to read, written in clear English, their web site does the job, their funds stick to what they claim in the prospectus, they constantly try to cut costs etc.

		About shorting stock.  I haven&#39;t run across a broker that would allow a client to invest the procedes from a short.  Generally they want to hold it in a segregated account (where they can invest it) and pay you nothing.   For large shorts (&gt;$100,000) or good customers they will negotiate some fixed return (a low fixed rate) on the funds.  If you know a broker that offers a decent return on short procedes (or lets you invest them!) I&#39;d like to know...

		As a guy who manages a pile of money for others (paid by clients, not commissions), Phil&#39;s overall view of the process is quite accurate and his approach is mostly correct. One exception however is the common oversight of confusing indexing with buying the S&amp;P 500 index. There are lots of other indexes out there such as EAFE, the S&amp;P Mid Cap 400 and the Russell 2000 that, when combined with the S&amp;P 500 can actually serve to both increase the chances of better returns over time and reduce short term volatility (our nice way of saying &#34;losing money&#34;).

		I don&#39;t agree with you idea that to progress in life you must have rich parents.

<p>

My grandfather quarreled his father and abandoned the home when he was nearly 18 (in 1918) without studies and money and with the only capability of drawing acceptabily well.

</p><p>

He went to the war in Africa in 1921 and came back to Spain where he married and began to work a jewel company making 3D pictures on silver (using his gift for drawing).

</p><p>

Soon he found himself with 4 children and not much income, so he employed his savings in buying some sheep. He would keep on working for others and the 2 or 3 sheep would be under the care of a shepperd. This shepperd would collect a comission when the animal were sold.

</p><p>

3 sheep made 6, 6 made 12, 12 made 24, 24, made 48, and so on.

</p><p>

Reached this point my grandfather left his job and settled as farmer and shepperd.

</p><p>

After he began with pigs and cows.

</p><p>

Apart from meat, he sold milk, and employed many other workers to take care of the cattle.

</p><p>

When the 60&#39;s reached and the economy got better, he began buying buildings:

</p><p>

2 buildings made 4, 4 made 8, 8 made 16, etc....

</p><p>

So when he died in 1986 he owned almost one whole neighbourhood of Madrid and gave many flats and buildings in inheritance to each one of his 7 children.

		Two additional items you might have mentioned:

<p>

1. Taxes &amp; Inflation.  Long term ownership of individual stocks has a significant tax advantage over mutual fund ownership, due to tax-free compounding of capital gains.  Most mutual funds distribute capital gains, as they frequently turnover portfolio holdings.  This applies to index funds too.  Seperately, inflation has a greater effect on eventual return than you suggest.  Because stock prices rise with inflation over the long term, investors pay capital gains taxes on grossly inflated, empty profits.  This is big.

</p><p>

2. Responsiblity for CEO&#39;s stealing from shareholders.  Since management reports to the board of directors, and the BOD represents shareholders, how do they get away with it?  Answer: Most shareholders use mutual funds.  Mutual funds do not allow their clients to vote the shares in the funds, even though the clients own the shares.  Instead, fund managers vote the shares.  Guess who recently played golf with the fund manager?  If you want fundamental reform of corporate management, outlaw the practice of funds voting shares.  Better yet, outlaw funds altogether (fat chance).

		I think the article is pretty good and comprehensive considering that it was written in 1996.  But I recommend adding some newer information, specifically:

<p>

(1) Vanguard&#39;s Total Stock Market tracing Wilshire 5000 is frequently preferable to S&amp;P500, because it is more diversified and it does not buy/sell as frequently as stocks move in and out of the index.

</p><p>

(2) Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) are a good alternative to index mutual funds for those who do not dollar-cost-average into it.

</p><p>

(3) Treasury Inflation Protection Securities (TIPS) are worth considering, especially by retirees.

</p><p>

(4) Single Premium Immediate Annuities (SPIA) may offer a better way not to outlive one&#39;s money than a frequently recommended Safe Withdrawal Rate (SWR) scheme.  (Note that these are different from variable annuities that generate huge profits to insurance agents and less value to their customers.)

</p><p>

These and many other topics are discussed at the Bogleheads Forum which I linked below.
