<p>A Nebraska teenager is facing criminal charges alleging she aborted a fetus in violation of state law, after authorities obtained her Facebook messages using a search warrant. Seventeen-year-old Celeste Burgess, who is being tried as an adult along with her mother Jessica Burgess, is awaiting trial in Madison County District Court on charges that they broke a Nebraska law banning abortions after 20 weeks.</p>

<p>This marks one of the first instances of a person’s Facebook activity being used to incriminate her in a state where abortion access is restricted — a scenario that has remained largely hypothetical in the weeks following the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Nebraska currently outlaws abortions beyond 20 weeks. On Monday, Republican lawmakers in the state <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nebraska-republicans-lack-votes-pass-12-week-abortion-ban-2022-08-08/" target="_blank" title="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nebraska-republicans-lack-votes-pass-12-week-abortion-ban-2022-08-08/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nebraska-republicans-lack-votes-pass-12-week-abortion-ban-2022-08-08/" aria-label="failed to secure enough votes">failed to secure enough votes</a> to decrease that window to 12 weeks.</p>

<p>Celeste and her mother were charged in July with allegedly removing, concealing or abandoning a dead human body and concealing the death of another person after the Norfolk Police Department received a tip claiming Celeste had miscarried in April at 23 weeks of pregnancy and secretly buried the fetus with her mother&#39;s help. The case was <a href="https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/nebraska/norfolk-mother-and-daughter-accused-of-illegal-abortion-burning-and-burying-body/article_ff99fd49-a710-5ec3-8d51-5aced3001c71.html" target="_blank" title="https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/nebraska/norfolk-mother-and-daughter-accused-of-illegal-abortion-burning-and-burying-body/article_ff99fd49-a710-5ec3-8d51-5aced3001c71.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/nebraska/norfolk-mother-and-daughter-accused-of-illegal-abortion-burning-and-burying-body/article_ff99fd49-a710-5ec3-8d51-5aced3001c71.html" aria-label="first reported">first reported</a> by the <em>Lincoln Journal Star</em>.</p>

<p>While Celeste told police that she had suffered a miscarriage, they continued to investigate, serving Facebook with a search warrant to access Celeste and Jessica’s Facebook accounts. They subsequently found messages between the mother and daughter allegedly detailing how Celeste had undergone a self-managed abortion with Jessica’s help. There are four states that ban abortion at 24 weeks, and more than a dozen that broadly ban it at the start of fetal viability.</p>

<p>Andy Stone, a Policy Communications Director at Facebook, acknowledged a request for comment but said he could not immediately confirm any details about the incident. </p>
<p>A month before Celeste was charged, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook parent Meta, was asked by employees how the company will protect those seeking abortions. Zuckerberg replied that efforts to expand encryption across the platform will “keep people safe,” <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/mark-zuckerberg-meta-facebook-abortion-roe-wade-privacy/" target="_blank" title="https://www.cyberscoop.com/mark-zuckerberg-meta-facebook-abortion-roe-wade-privacy/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cyberscoop.com/mark-zuckerberg-meta-facebook-abortion-roe-wade-privacy/" aria-label="CyberScoop reported"><em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cyberscoop.com/mark-zuckerberg-meta-facebook-abortion-roe-wade-privacy/">CyberScoop </em>reported</a>. In May, Meta’s VP of HR, Janelle Gale, told employees they were not allowed to discuss abortion at work, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/19/23131714/meta-ban-abortion-discussion-at-work-facebook-workplace-roe-v-wade" target="_blank" title="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/19/23131714/meta-ban-abortion-discussion-at-work-facebook-workplace-roe-v-wade" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/19/23131714/meta-ban-abortion-discussion-at-work-facebook-workplace-roe-v-wade" aria-label="according to the Verge">according to the <em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/19/23131714/meta-ban-abortion-discussion-at-work-facebook-workplace-roe-v-wade">Verge</em></a>.

<p>Still, Meta has <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/28/1055044/big-tech-data-privacy-supreme-court-dobbs-abortion/" target="_blank" title="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/28/1055044/big-tech-data-privacy-supreme-court-dobbs-abortion/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/28/1055044/big-tech-data-privacy-supreme-court-dobbs-abortion/" aria-label="remained largely silent">remained largely silent</a> on how it will moderate abortion content in general.

At the same time, Meta continued to earn revenue from anti-abortion advertisements containing dangerous misinformation,<em> </em><a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/facebook/facebook-has-earned-tens-thousands-dollars-running-ads-misinformation-about-abortion-pills" target="_blank" title="https://www.mediamatters.org/facebook/facebook-has-earned-tens-thousands-dollars-running-ads-misinformation-about-abortion-pills" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.mediamatters.org/facebook/facebook-has-earned-tens-thousands-dollars-running-ads-misinformation-about-abortion-pills" aria-label="Media Matters found"><em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.mediamatters.org/facebook/facebook-has-earned-tens-thousands-dollars-running-ads-misinformation-about-abortion-pills">Media Matters</em> found</a>.

<fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-1"></fbs-ad>
<p>In response to pressure from employees, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/technology/google-abortion-location-data.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/technology/google-abortion-location-data.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/technology/google-abortion-location-data.html" aria-label="Google announced">Google announced</a> that it would delete location data of users who had used the platform to look up abortion services.</p>
<p>All of the largest tech giants have been pressed on whether, and to what extent, they may cooperate in investigations that seek to punish women for seeking an abortion. In June, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/29/google-facebook-abortion-data/" target="_blank" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/29/google-facebook-abortion-data/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/29/google-facebook-abortion-data/" aria-label="told the Washington Post">told the <em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/29/google-facebook-abortion-data/">Washington Post</em></a> that the company “carefully scrutinize[s] all government requests for user information and often push[es] back, including in court.”</p>
<p>A District Attorney assigned to the case declined to comment. An attorney for Celeste Burgess did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p><em>Update: This story has been updated to note that the Facebook messages were obtained via search warrant.</em></p>
