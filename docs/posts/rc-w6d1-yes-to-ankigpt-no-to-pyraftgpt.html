    <h1>RC W6D1 - Yes to ankiGPT, No to pyraftGPT</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_1956083">
    
      <div><p>The first draft of this post was handwritten on paper. This was by design.<br/></p><p>I decided to <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/rc-w5d5-switching-gears">switch gears</a> to learning how ChatGPT works under the hood, post-conversation with a friend last week. I also took the opportunity to update my LinkedIn profile. This was something I was initially hesitant about doing; partly to concentrate on functional programming, partly to spend a bit of time more deliberately thinking what I&#39;d like to do next.</p><p>At the <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/rc-w1d5-haskell">start of RC</a>, I wasn&#39;t sure whether to learn functional programming or spend time on Andrej Karpathy&#39;s videos. Why Andrej Karpathy? I really enjoyed the material he put together for the <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2016/">Stanford CS231n</a> course on computer vision, which then inspired me to come up with a 1-hour <a href="https://github.com/savarin/neural-networks">intro on neural networks</a> for SquareU.</p><p>I spent a bit of time going through the video on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0">minimal backprop</a>; it&#39;s deceptively simple. On a related note, the intro above had a <a href="https://github.com/savarin/neural-networks/blob/master/Appendix-SGD.ipynb">graphic</a> on how the weights change when it goes through stochastic gradient descent but only for a 1-layer network.</p><p>The rest of the day I used ChatGPT as a consumer. The first use case was creating Anki flashcards; I did a lot of courses at <a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/">Bradfield</a> but I&#39;ve also forgotten a lot of what I learned. GPT-4 is very good at creating flashcards. I would use the text from <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">OSTEP</a> into the prompts for the <a href="https://github.com/savarin/anki/blob/main/content/operating-systems/ostep-cards.txt" title="Link: https://github.com/savarin/anki/blob/main/content/operating-systems/ostep-cards.txt">final version</a>, but the question-and-answers <a href="https://gist.github.com/savarin/f543bdac2a5ae952f996db7c7843d509" title="Link: https://gist.github.com/savarin/f543bdac2a5ae952f996db7c7843d509">sets</a> it came out with when I tried prompting <b>without</b> any OSTEP text (hence completely made up) were impressive!</p><p>What I wasn&#39;t able to get GPT-4 to do was implement Raft in Python. I copied the the tests from my <a href="https://github.com/savarin/raft">implementation</a> into the prompt, and tried to get GPT-4 to write code that would pass the tests. If errors were raised, I would paste the error in full as a prompt to get the next iteration. This failed on the same test <a href="https://github.com/savarin/gpt-raft/commits/fa673a0cc6659aed3c6f3b825873218fa28b5df5">10 times</a> in a row. Next time I&#39;ll try helping it along after repeated failures, to see how far we end up.</p><p>The amusing part was how, after a few failed iterations, ChatGPT tried to change the function&#39;s parameters from 4 to 5 and asked me to change the tests accordingly! I shared this with a friend, who then responded as follows.</p><blockquote><p>A candidate tried that with me during an interview. Human level AI.</p></blockquote></div>
