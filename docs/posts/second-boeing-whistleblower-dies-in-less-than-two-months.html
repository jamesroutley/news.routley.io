    <p>Another whistleblower who publicly spoke out about safety issues with Boeing planes has died, less than two months after fellow whistleblower John Barnett died from a gunshot wound police have yet to finish investigating.</p>
<p>Joshua Dean, a former quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems and one of the first to allege wilful ignorance of manufacturing defects on the notorious 737 MAX, died after a &#34;short and sudden illness&#34;, the <i><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/whistleblower-josh-dean-of-boeing-supplier-spirit-aerosystems-has-died/" target="_blank">Seattle Times</a></i> reports.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old was reportedly &#34;known for a healthy lifestyle&#34; but fell ill and was admitted to hospital a little over two weeks ago due to breathing difficulties. He was subsequently diagnosed with pneumonia and a severe bacterial infection known as MRSA.</p>
<p>Despite various treatments, his condition worsened rapidly before it was revealed he had suffered a stroke, and Dean&#39;s mother posted on Facebook on April 26 that he was &#34;fighting for his life&#34;.</p>
<p>He died Tuesday morning (local time), the <i>Seattle Times</i> quotes his aunt Carol Parsons as confirming. A Spirit spokesperson said: &#34;Our thoughts are with Josh Dean&#39;s family. This sudden loss is stunning news here and for his loved ones.&#34;</p>

    <p>Dean and Barnett were both represented by the same legal company in South Carolina.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2024/03/boeing-whistleblower-found-dead-in-truck-in-south-carolina-during-lawsuit-against-company.html" target="_blank">Barnett died from a gunshot wound</a> in Charleston, the same South Carolina city Boeing has its 787 manufacturing facility, the coroner reported his death appeared to be &#34;self-inflicted&#34;; but the police are yet to complete their investigation into his death.</p>
<p>&#34;They found him in his truck. I don&#39;t know what to say. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this in my life,&#34; one of his lawyers Brian Knowles told media.</p>
<p>Boeing released a statement at the time saying the company was &#34;saddened&#34; by Barnett&#39;s death.</p>
<p>Knowles told the <i>Seattle Times</i> he would not speculate on the close timing and circumstances of the two deaths.</p>
<p>“Whistleblowers are needed. They bring to light wrongdoing and corruption in the interests of society. It takes a lot of courage to stand up,” Knowles said.</p>
<p>&#34;It&#39;s a difficult set of circumstances. Our thoughts now are with John’s family and Josh’s family.&#34;</p>
<p>A recent deposition and complaint filed by Dean have brought attention to what he alleged was &#34;serious and gross misconduct by senior quality management&#34; within Spirit&#39;s 737 production line.</p>
<p>It came amid heightened scrutiny of a Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and former colleagues of Dean have corroborated some of his claims.</p>
<p>Barnett, who was 62 when he died, was a veteran of 32 years at Boeing and was well known for his vocal criticism of the company&#39;s alleged decline in production standards.</p>
<p>He died amid providing testimony in a high-profile legal case against Boeing, having testified just days prior and shortly before he was scheduled for further questioning.</p>
