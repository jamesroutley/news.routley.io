<p><strong>Doctors writing prescriptions for island getaways may sound like a fantasy, but new research exploring the health benefits of tourism may turn this dream into a future reality.</strong></p>

        <p><span>Aside from “the printer is broken,” “I need a vacation” has to be one of the most frequently uttered phrases in offices around the world</span><span>—d</span><span>aydreaming about an escape is a habit many of us share. And while we certainly </span><i><span>want</span></i><span> to travel, do we really </span><i><span>need </span></i><span>to travel?</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>A team of researchers from </span><a href="https://www.ecu.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Edith Cowan University</span></a><span> in Australia is pondering similar questions by exploring the potential for travel to enhance our quality of life. While still in its infancy, this research may end up reframing travel as an activity that’s essential to our well-being</span><span>—</span><span>and far more than just something we do for fun.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Anecdotally, many people say that vacations </span><a href="https://adventure.com/travel-medicine-healing-power"><span>improve their mental health</span></a><span>. Studies also reflect this. For example, recent research indicated that tourists with sub-optimal health who engaged in domestic travel more frequently demonstrated better mental health.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>“</b><span>This correlation provides preliminary support for the role of tourism in individuals’ health. This also shows tourism as a possible way to improve people’s mental health in general,” says Dr. Jun Wen, a Chinese researcher currently living and working at Edith Cowan University.</span></p>

        <p><span>Wen explains that the cross-disciplinary research team he’s a part of consists of academics across tourism, psychology, marketing, and medical science, all collaborating to study the potential benefits of travel for people with a range of conditions, including dementia and psychological disorders such as depression. “Travel is a familiar and often favorite part of our leisure activities, so it’s exciting that it could offer medical benefits,” he says.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>While it may seem like a bit of a no-brainer that </span><a href="https://adventure.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=36424&amp;action=edit"><span>trips make us feel good</span></a><span>, it’s important to understand the factors behind why this might be the case. Yes, watching a beach sunset is </span><a href="https://adventure.com/annual-leave-entitlement-using-it-up/"><span>infinitely more pleasing</span></a><span> than sitting in hellish traffic while commuting home from a long day working in a cubicle… But there’s more to it than that. </span></p>

        <p><span>For instance, many common elements of travel (such as increased exercise and more exposure to sunlight and fresh air) are linked to the </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>increased production of serotonin</span></a><span>, a neurotransmitter linked to mood stabilization.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>For many of us, putting together an itinerary, bookmarking trips and researching destinations feels as therapeutic as travel itself. “All tourism experiences offer elements of anticipation and planning, both of which stimulate brain function,” says Wen, who adds that group travel may also provide</span> <span>psychological benefits associated with forming new connections.</span></p>

        <p><span>Exercise is another hallmark of travel. Even if you’re not </span><a href="https://adventure.com/salkantay-trail-trekking-hiking-machu-picchu/"><span>trekking</span></a><span> the Himalayas, just exploring a new city on foot boosts your daily step count. With physical activity frequently recommended for people diagnosed with depression, anxiety and dementia, travel (along with other therapies) could just be a crucial part of maintaining your well-being.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Dr. Deb Mills, </span><span>doctor and medical director of the </span><a href="https://www.travelmedicine.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Travel Medicine Alliance</span></a><span> (TMA),</span> <span>agrees that travel can be highly beneficial for our mental and physical health but staying well while traveling is key.</span><b><br/>

        <p><span>Mills also believes your choice of travel destination could play a vital role in whether your trip is beneficial (or detrimental) to your health, especially if </span><a href="https://adventure.com/traveling-solo-with-multiple-sclerosis/"><span>you have a pre-existing condition</span></a><span>. While health advice should be tailored to each individual, there are certain corners of the world that carry more risk than others.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“The tropics generally have more diseases. The germs just love the tropics. Dengue Fever loves the tropics,” says Mills, adding: “Leptospirosis [a zoonotic disease endemic in countries with humid, tropical climates] is another one. So if people with medical conditions are going into the jungles of Borneo or Papua New Guinea, they’re going to be much more at risk.” </span></p>

        <p><span><a href="https://adventure.com/island-life-remote-arctic-norway/">Remote destinations</a> are also riskier. Apart from having less robust healthcare systems, remote and rural areas are more likely to have diseases like malaria. It’s for this reason that people should get specialized advice before considering a trip to a remote part of the world.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“The more you get off the beaten track, the more these types of diseases can be a problem. Things can get very dangerous, very quickly in some parts of the world,” says Mills. </span></p>
