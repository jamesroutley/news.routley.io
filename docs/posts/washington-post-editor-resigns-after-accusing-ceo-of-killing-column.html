    <h1>Washington Post editor resigns after accusing CEO of killing column</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus resigned Monday after accusing the paper&#39;s CEO and publisher of killing her column criticizing owner Jeff Bezos&#39; latest editorial edict.</p><p>Marcus, an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/ruth-marcus/" target="_blank">associate editor and columnist</a> with The Post&#39;s opinion section, is leaving the paper where she&#39;s been employed since 1984.</p><p>&#34;We’re grateful for Ruth’s significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years,&#34; a spokesperson for The Washington Post said in a statement to NBC News. &#34;We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.”</p><p>In a resignation letter to Bezos and CEO William Lewis, Marcus said &#34;independent judgement&#34;  is no longer in play at The Post opinion section and new editorial policies will &#34;break the trust of readers that columnists are writing what they believe, and not what the owners has deemed acceptable.&#34; </p><p>Bezos, the Amazon founder who purchased the venerable publication in 2013, told the staff last month that the opinion section would take a radical turn by &#34;writing every day in support and defense” of “personal liberties and free markets.&#34;</p><p>Marcus said she wrote a column deviating from Bezos&#39; edict— and Lewis spiked it.</p><p>&#34;Will&#39;s decision to not run the column that I wrote respectfully dissenting from Jeff&#39;s edict — something that I have not experienced in almost two decades of column-writing — underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,&#34; Marcus wrote in her resignation, according to <a href="https://x.com/BenMullin/status/1899103014633222594" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>.</p><p>Bezos&#39; sudden policy change prompted the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/media/jeff-bezos-washington-post-op-ed-david-shipley-rcna193817" target="_blank">resignation of opinion editor</a> David Shipley and has been interpreted as a bid to curry favor with President Donald Trump.</p><p>Bezos and other affluent tech titans raised eyebrows in January by attending<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trumps-embrace-worlds-biggest-tech-ceos-reorients-attention-economy-rcna188886" target="_blank"> the president’s inauguration</a>.</p><p>&#34;I love the Post,&#34; Marcus concluded her resignation letter. &#34;It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave. I have the deepest affection and admiration for my colleagues and will miss them every day. And I wish you both the best as you steer this storied and critical institution through troubled times.&#34;</p><p>Marcus could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday. </p></div><div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/david-k-li-ncpn915856" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2019_28/2931081/190618-david-k-li-byline2174.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_28/2931081/190618-david-k-li-byline2174.jpg 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_28/2931081/190618-david-k-li-byline2174.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"/></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/david-k-li-ncpn915856">David K.
