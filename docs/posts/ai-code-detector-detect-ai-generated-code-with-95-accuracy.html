    <h1>Show HN: AI Code Detector – detect AI-generated code with 95% accuracy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>AI Code Detector is powered by span-detect-1, a machine learning classifier trained on millions of AI-generated and human-written code samples. It looks at semantically-generated &#34;chunks&#34; of code to classify them as AI-generated and human-written based on patterns in style, syntax, and structure.</p></div><div><p>AI coding tools are everywhere, but it&#39;s very difficult to understand their actual impact. Vendors sometimes have reporting systems, but they are inconsistent with one another. The machine learning model that powers AI Code Detector, span-detect-1, gives engineering leaders real visibility into the AI code in their repos.</p></div><div><p>AI Code Detector’s underlying model, span-detect-1, is 95% accurate for Typescript and Python. Accuracy varies with chunk size, but we consistently test on independent datasets to avoid overfitting and to keep ourselves honest.</p></div><div><p>Some code, like import statements and other boilerplate, doesn&#39;t contain enough signal to classify confidently. Rather than guess, span-detect-1 abstains and marks those chunks as unknown. About 10% of chunks fall into this category.</p></div><div><p>Yes. You can use span-detect-1 as part of Span’s developer intelligence platform. With Span, you can not only detect AI- versus human-authored code, but also track adoption KPIs, quality outcomes, and the impact of AI coding assistants.</p></div></div></div></div>
