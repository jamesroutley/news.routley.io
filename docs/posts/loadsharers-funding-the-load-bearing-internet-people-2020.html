    <h1>Loadsharers: Funding the Load Bearing Internet People (2020)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Loadsharers is a social network that has agreed to fund LBIPs through
remittance services like Patreon, SubscribeStar, Liberapay, and PayPal.</p>
<p>Loadsharers take the following pledge:</p>
<p>&#34;While I am gainfully employed, I will remit at least $30 a month to
one, two, or three LBIPs, preferably 3.&#34;  (It is understood that $30
may need to be inflation-adjusted in the future.  Think: the cost of
one moderately-priced restaurant meal.)</p>
<p>Because discovering where to direct support most efficiently isnâ€™t
easy, the Loadsharers network has a tier of <strong>advisers</strong> (experienced
LBIPs themselves) who collect information on worthy people and projects
from the network and make recommendations about good targets.</p>
<p>Distributed discovery means that as many eyes as there are loadsharers
are on the problem of identifying LBIPs.  The combination of that
with three-way fanout should avoid all the funding being captured
by a few high-visibility people.</p>
<p>Every loadsharer has total control of where their money goes at all
times and can choose which advisers to follow (or to follow
none!). This avoids the organizational-capture problem.</p>
<p>The rest is details.</p>
