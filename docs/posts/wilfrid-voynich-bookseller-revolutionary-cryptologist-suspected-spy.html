As he often did, Voynich got to speaking about his prized possession: a mysterious codex which he had bought four years earlier in Italy. </p><p>Today, it’s known as the Voynich manuscript. </p><p>It was a misunderstood remark of Voynich’s about his most famous find that got him tagged by the Bureau of Investigation — predecessor of today’s FBI — as a possible German spy. </p><p><span>This is how a 1917 memo in </span><a href="https://www.colinmackinnon.com/attachments/The_US_BOI_File_on_Voynich_p.pdf" rel="">Voynich’s Bureau of Investigation</a><span> file puts it:</span></p><blockquote><p>During the past year we have had in Chicago a man by the name of Wilfred M. Voynich… When he was here last year, he was entertained by the Librarian at his house in Evanston, where there were present two other people, a man and a woman. During the dinner he made the statement that he had in his possession the cipher of the American War Department. This Voynich is the husband of a well-known English author Ethel Lillian Voynich, who wrote the “Gadfly”… He is possibly a German.</p></blockquote><p>In truth, Voynich had recently fled his home in London to avoid World War I (“fearing zeppelins,” as one 1915 newspaper article about Voynich’s treasures put it), and had no connection to German intelligence.</p><p><span>This claim that an antiquarian book dealer “had in his possession the cipher of the American War Department” is likely a result of a bizarre mistake: the </span><em>Voynich manuscript itself</em><span> was taken to be a secret American code. </span></p><p><span>The mixup makes a </span><em>bit</em><span> more sense — barely — when we consider another entry in Voynich’s government file. It’s a warning from one W. S. Booth, an otherwise forgotten academic, that Voynich was boasting that he had enlisted the War Department’s codebreakers to try to “transliterate” his “Bacon cipher MS [manuscript].” </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65d755d7-6894-425a-b5df-2655f05b1f49_2338x1808.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65d755d7-6894-425a-b5df-2655f05b1f49_2338x1808.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65d755d7-6894-425a-b5df-2655f05b1f49_2338x1808.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65d755d7-6894-425a-b5df-2655f05b1f49_2338x1808.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65d755d7-6894-425a-b5df-2655f05b1f49_2338x1808.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65d755d7-6894-425a-b5df-2655f05b1f49_2338x1808.png" width="1456" height="1126" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/65d755d7-6894-425a-b5df-2655f05b1f49_2338x1808.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1126,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:2645108,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65d755d7-6894-425a-b5df-2655f05b1f49_2338x1808.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65d755d7-6894-425a-b5df-2655f05b1f49_2338x1808.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65d755d7-6894-425a-b5df-2655f05b1f49_2338x1808.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65d755d7-6894-425a-b5df-2655f05b1f49_2338x1808.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>Voynich’s June 25, 1917 letter to Booth about his mysterious ciphered manuscript, with Booth’s suspicious annotations (“Why?”).</figcaption></figure></div><p>Booth passed the letter to the Bureau of Investigation with a note: “I have no reason to suppose that this man is not what he is &amp; and has been known to be — a book seller. But if he has the run of the War Dept. cipher or signals rooms he will bear a close watch.” </p><p>The Bureau evidently agreed. A file was opened, and an investigation began. </p><p><span>Who really </span><em>was </em><span>Wilfrid Voynich?</span></p><p> Almost everything in his Bureau file is wrong. But the truth of Voynich’s shape-shifting life really is deeply mysterious. I find it so surprising that there isn’t a biography of Wilfrid and his wife, Lillian, that I might write one myself. </p><p><span>Reed Johnson’s </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-unread-the-mystery-of-the-voynich-manuscript:" rel="">excellent 2013 article</a><span> in </span><em>The</em><span> </span><em>New Yorker</em><span> summarizes the basics:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Much can be written about Wilfrid Voynich. An ethnic Pole from the Russian Empire, Voynich was imprisoned in Siberia for revolutionary activities. He escaped, via Manchuria and China, to London, where he met his future wife, Ethel Boole. Boole, the daughter of the famous mathematician </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole" rel="">George Boole</a><span>, who became a popular novelist, was enmeshed in Russian revolutionary activity in London; the bookshop that Voynich set up with her was rumored to be a secret front for organization against the tsarist regime. Whatever the reasons for his entrée into the rare-book business, he apparently took to this work.</span></p></blockquote><p>See what I mean? Mysterious! </p><p><span>Something I love about Voynich’s story is its fractal-like quality. Each detail seemingly could be expanded into an adventure novel or epic </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microhistory" rel="">microhistory</a><span> — if only we knew just a bit more. </span></p><p><span>For instance, there were several months of trans-Asian travel after his escape from the Siberian prison camp (on his third attempt) before he ended up in Europe. In between, it appears he trekked via </span><a href="https://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesEurope/EasternPoland_Voynich01.htm" rel="">caravan</a><span> from Mongolia to Beijing. He likely had a knack for forging documents, because his escape was achieved by means of a fake passport.</span></p><p><span>There’s also the fact that his father-in-law was a </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6517392/" rel="">genius</a><span> </span><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691176000/the-logician-and-the-engineer" rel="">credited</a><span> with laying the foundation of the Information Age. Or that his wife wrote a best-selling novel that was partially inspired by her torrid affair with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Reilly" rel="">Sidney Reilly</a><span>, the infamous spy who also helped inspire the character of James Bond.</span></p><p><span>And then there’s his friendship with the Ukrainian nihilist </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Stepnyak-Kravchinsky" rel="">Sergius Stepniak</a><span>. Wilfrid Voynich and Stepniak co-founded the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Friends_of_Russian_Freedom" rel="">Society of Friends of Russian Freedom</a><span> in London. They were both political exiles. Not long before Wilfrid first met him, Stepniak </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/books/review/constance-garnett-russia-revolution-translation.html" rel="">assassinated the head of Russia&#39;s secret police</a><span> on the streets of St. Petersburg with a concealed dagger.</span></p><p>Suffice to say, this is not the typical biography of a rare book dealer.  </p><p>Perhaps it was some knowledge of this past which made the Bureau take the tip-off  seriously enough to arrive on Voynich’s doorstep one day in 1917. </p><p>The Aeolian building is a stately neoclassical skyscraper in midtown Manhattan. It once hosted some of the world’s leading musicians in the grand concert hall on its ground floor. And in 1917, it was also home to Voynich’s Manhattan office.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc9b622d-9268-41cc-be24-027347fe4c6b_1008x535.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc9b622d-9268-41cc-be24-027347fe4c6b_1008x535.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc9b622d-9268-41cc-be24-027347fe4c6b_1008x535.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc9b622d-9268-41cc-be24-027347fe4c6b_1008x535.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc9b622d-9268-41cc-be24-027347fe4c6b_1008x535.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc9b622d-9268-41cc-be24-027347fe4c6b_1008x535.png" width="586" height="311.0218253968254" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fc9b622d-9268-41cc-be24-027347fe4c6b_1008x535.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:535,&#34;width&#34;:1008,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:586,&#34;bytes&#34;:1121541,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc9b622d-9268-41cc-be24-027347fe4c6b_1008x535.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc9b622d-9268-41cc-be24-027347fe4c6b_1008x535.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc9b622d-9268-41cc-be24-027347fe4c6b_1008x535.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc9b622d-9268-41cc-be24-027347fe4c6b_1008x535.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>The street frontage and concert hall of the Aeolian Building in the 1920s. </figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The Bureau’s agents thoroughly questioned Voynich, then just as thoroughly searched Voynich’s office. They turned up nothing. But that did not end the suspicion. Later that year, agents of Bureau’s civilian auxiliary, the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Protective_League" rel="">American Protective League</a><span>, began working the case as well. </span></p><p><span>The APL officer who led the charge was named Lloyd A. Wimpfheimer. In peacetime, Wimpfheimer worked for a company that sold </span><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Hat_Industry/OyohbZoxkycC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22lloyd+a.+wimpfheimer%22&amp;pg=RA4-PA19&amp;printsec=frontcover" rel="">&#34;hat materials</a><span>.” In 1917, however, he threw himself with great dedication — and deeply questionable competence — into the role of semi-professional spy-hunter. </span></p><p>Wimpfheimer believed that Voynich was something more than he appeared. Some of his informants seemingly agreed. </p><p>The bookseller George E. Smith of 46 East 45th Street, for instance, said he had known Voynich for a long time, “and did not want to do business with him.” Smith “could not give any definite reason, but did not trust him.” (There was likely some professional jealousy at work:  Smith took the opportunity to complain that Voynich “was always boasting that he could get manuscripts better than anyone else.”)</p><p><span>Above all, Voynich kept talking up his “Bacon cipher manuscript,” so called due to Voynich’s suspicion (since proven false) that its author was the medieval natural philosopher and monk </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon" rel="">Roger Bacon</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>It is little wonder why Wilfrid Voynich was so fascinated by the riddles of this 240-page text, which is today owned by Yale University’s Beinecke Library.
