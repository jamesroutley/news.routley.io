<p><em>Todays candles have been optimized for millenia not to flicker. But it turns out when we bundle three of them together, we can undo all of these optimizations and the resulting triplet will start to naturally oscillate. A fascinating fact is that the oscillation frequency is rather stable at ~9.9Hz as it mainly depends on gravity and diameter of the flame. </em></p>



<p><em>We use a rather unusual approach based on a wire suspended in the flame, that can sense capacitance changes caused by the ionized gases in the flame, to detect this frequency</em> <em>and divide it down to 1Hz.</em></p>



<h3>Introduction</h3>



<p>Candlelight is a curious thing. Candles seem to have a life of their own: the brightness wanders, they flicker, and they react to the faintest motion of air.</p>



<p>There has always been an innate curiosity in understanding how candle flames work and behave. In recent years, people have also extensively sought to emulate this behavior with electronic light sources. I have also been fascinated by this and tried to understand <a href="https://cpldcpu.com/2016/01/05/reverse-engineering-a-real-candle/">real candles</a> and how <a href="https://cpldcpu.com/2013/12/08/hacking-a-candleflicker-led/">artificial candles</a> work.</p>



<p>Now, it’s a curious thing that we try to emulate the imperfections of candles.  After all, candle makers have worked for centuries (and millennia) on optimizing candles NOT to flicker?</p>



<p>In essence: The trick is that there is a very delicate balance in how much fuel (the molten candle wax) is fed into the flame. If there is too much, the candle starts to flicker even when undisturbed. This is controlled by how the wick is made.</p>



<h3>Candle Triplet Oscillations</h3>



<p>Now, there is a particularly fascinating effect that has more recently been the subject of publications in scientific journals<sup data-fn="b458422a-9a0f-4f69-8194-c691d4a7194c"><a href="#b458422a-9a0f-4f69-8194-c691d4a7194c" id="b458422a-9a0f-4f69-8194-c691d4a7194c-link">1</a></sup><sup data-fn="674c9670-40b1-4765-90d3-ca63ebe5d7a4"><a href="#674c9670-40b1-4765-90d3-ca63ebe5d7a4" id="674c9670-40b1-4765-90d3-ca63ebe5d7a4-link">2</a></sup> : When several candles are brought close to each other, they start to “communicate” and their behavior synchronizes. The simplest demonstration is to bundle three candles together; they will behave like a single large flame.</p>



<p>So, what happens with our bundle of three candles? It will basically undo millennia of candle technology optimization to avoid candle flicker. If left alone in motionless air, the flames will suddenly start to rapidly change their height and begin to flicker. The image below shows two states in that cycle.</p>

<p>Two states of the oscillation cycle in bundled candles</p>



<p>We can also record the brightness variation over time to understand this process better. In this case, a high-resolution ambient light sensor was used to sample the flicker over time. (This was part of more comprehensive set experiments of conducted a while ago, which are still unpublished)</p>



<p>Plotting the brightness evolution over time shows that the oscillations are surprisingly stable, as shown in the image below. We can see a very nice sawtooth-like signal: the flame slowly grows larger until it collapses and the cycle begins anew. You can see a video of this behavior <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/2N9h_YpQUy4">here</a>. (Which, unfortunately cannot embed properly due to WordPress…)</p>

<p>Left: Brightness variation over time showing sawtooth pattern. </p>



<p>On the right side of the image, you can see the power spectral density plot of the brightness signal on the left. The oscillation is remarkably stable at a frequency of 9.9 Hz.</p>



<p>This is very curious. Wouldn’t you expect more chaotic behavior, considering that everything else about flames seems so random?</p>



<p>The phenomenon of flame oscillations has baffled researchers for a long time. Curiously, they found that <strong>the oscillation frequency of a candle flame</strong> (or rather a <em>“wick-stabilized buoyant diffusion flame”</em>) <strong>depends mainly on just two variables: gravity and the dimension of the fuel source.</strong> A comprehensive review can be found in Xia et al.<sup data-fn="797415ff-39e2-466b-b67e-b26e19613a76"><a href="#797415ff-39e2-466b-b67e-b26e19613a76" id="797415ff-39e2-466b-b67e-b26e19613a76-link">3</a></sup>.</p>



<p>Now that is interesting: gravity is rather constant (on Earth) and the dimensions of the fuel source are defined by the size (diameter) of the candles and possibly their proximity. <strong>This leaves us with a fairly stable source of oscillation, or timing, at approximately 10Hz.</strong> Could we use the 9.9 Hz oscillation to derive a time base?</p>



<h3>Sensing Candle Frequencies with a Phototransistor</h3>



<p>Now that we have a source of stable oscillations—remind you, <strong>FROM FIRE</strong>—we need to convert them into an electrical signal.</p>



<p>The previous investigation of candle flicker was based an I²C-based light sensor to sample the light signal. This provides very high SNR, but is comparatively complex and adds latency.</p>



<p>A phototransistor provides a simpler option.  Below you can see the setup with a phototransistor in a 3mm wired package (arrow). Since the phototransistor has internal gain, it provides a much higher current than a photodiode and can be easily picked up without additional amplification.</p>

<p>Phototransistor setup with sensing resistor configuration</p>



<p>The phototransistor was connected via a sensing resistor to a constant voltage source, with the oscilloscope connected across the sensing resistor. The output signal was quite stable and showed a nice ~9.9 Hz oscillation.</p>



<p>In the next step, this could be connected to an ADC input of a microcontroller to process the signal further. But curiously, there is also a simpler way of detecting the flame oscillations.</p>



<h3>Capacitive Flame Sensing</h3>



<p>Capacitive touch peripherals are part of many microcontrollers and can be easily implemented with an integrated ADC by measuring discharge rates versus an integrated pull-up resistor, or by a charge-sharing approach in a capacitive ADC.</p>



<p>While this is not the most obvious way of measuring changes in a flame, it is to be expected to observe some variations. The heated flame with all its combustion products contains ionized molecules to some degree and is likely to have different dielectric properties compared to the surrounding air, which will be observed as either a change of capacitance or increased electrical loss. A quick internet search also revealed publications on capacitance-based flame detectors.</p>



<p>A CH32V003 microcontroller with the <a href="https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32fun">CH32fun</a> environment was used for experiments. The set up is shown below: the microcontroller is located on the small PCB to the left. The capacitance is sensed between a wire suspended in the flame (the scorched one) and a ground wire that is wound around the candle. The setup is completed with an LED as an output.</p>

<p>Complete capacitive sensing setup with CH32V003 microcontroller, candle triplet and a LED.</p>



<p>Initial attempts with two wires in the flame did not yield better results and the setup was mechanically much more unstable.</p>



<p>Read out was implemented straightforward using the TouchADC function that is part of CH32fun. This function measures the capacitance on an input pin by charging it to a voltage and measuring voltage decay while it is discharged via a pull-up/pull-down resistor. To reduce noise, it was necessary to average 32 measurements.</p>


<div><pre title="">// Enable GPIOD, C and ADC
RCC-&gt;APB2PCENR |= RCC_APB2Periph_GPIOA | RCC_APB2Periph_GPIOD | RCC_APB2Periph_GPIOC | RCC_APB2Periph_ADC1;

InitTouchADC();
...

int iterations = 32;
sum = ReadTouchPin( GPIOA, 2, 0, iterations );
</pre></div>


<p>First attempts confirmed to concept to work. The sample trace below shows sequential measurements of a flickering candle until it was blown out at the end, as signified by the steep drop of the signal.</p>



<p>The signal is noisier than the optical signal and shows more baseline wander and amplitude drift—but we can work with that. Let’s put it all together.</p>

<p>Capacitive sensing trace showing candle oscillations and extinction</p>



<h3>Putting everything together</h3>



<p>Additional digitial signal processing is necessary to clean up the signal and extract a stable 1 Hz clock reference.</p>



<p>The data traces were recorded with a Python script from the monitor output and saved as csv files. A separate Python script was used to analyze the data and prototype the signal processing chain. The sample rate is limited to around ~90 Hz due to the overhead of printing data via the debug output, but the data rate turned out to be sufficient for this case.</p>

<p>The image above shows an overview of the signal chain. The raw data (after 32x averaging) is shown on the left. The signal is filtered with an IIR filter to extract the baseline (red). The middle figure shows the signal with baseline removed and zero-cross detection. The zero-cross detector will tag the first sample after a negative-to-positive transition with a short dead-time to prevent it from latching to noise. The right plot shows the PSD of the overall and high-pass filtered signal, showing that despite the wandering input signal, we get a sharp ~9.9 Hz peak for the main frequency.</p>



<p>A detailed zoom-in of raw samples with baseline and HP filtered data is shown below.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s marvel at the result again! You can see the candle flickering at 10 Hz and the LED next to it blinking at 1 Hz! The framerate of the GIF is unfortunately limited, which causes some aliasing. You can see a higher framerate version on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNFMftN1w9s">YouTube</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/cpldcpu/CandleSense/tree/master/media">original file</a>.</p>



<p>That’s all for our journey from undoing millennia of candle-flicker-mitigation work to turning this into a clock source that can be sensed with a bare wire and a microcontroller. Back to the decade-long quest to build a perfect electronic candle emulation…</p>



<p>All data and code is published in <a href="https://github.com/cpldcpu/CandleSense">this repository</a>.</p>
