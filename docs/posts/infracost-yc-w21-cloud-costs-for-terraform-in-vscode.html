    <h1>Show HN: Infracost (YC W21): Cloud Costs for Terraform in VSCode</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Hey, Hugo from Infracost (<a href="https://www.infracost.io" rel="nofollow">https://www.infracost.io</a>) here. Infracost shows engineers the cost of each Terraform change in CI/CD before launching resources. When something changes, it posts a comment with the cloud cost impact. e.g. you’ve added two instances and volumes and have changed an instance type from medium to large; this will increase your bill by 25% next month from $1000 to $1250 per month.<p>Over the last few months, I&#39;ve been working on a native evaluation for Terraform. Previously we relied on the Terraform CLI to fetch cloud resource information, which was a little slow and cumbersome.</p><p>Native parsing is not only lightning-fast, but it means we have contextual file information, which allows us to try a load of cool new things. For example, we could provide real-time suggestions to optimise your cloud costs as you write your infrastructure code! This VSCode extension is the result of a few weeks of hacking away whilst I should have been relaxing in the sun in Italy... time better spent, I think!</p><p>We&#39;re excited about the possibilities of directly integrating with editors. There is so much we can do to make DevOps lives easier when optimising cloud spend. Right now, we&#39;re looking for your feedback on this initial version of the extension. It currently ships with:</p><p>1. Show a snapshot of the total cost of resources right above their Terraform definitions. Updated on file save.</p><p>2. Resource and module blocks support showing cost estimates, including 3rd party module blocks.</p><p>3. A cost overview web-view shows a detailed breakdown of what components affect the price.</p><p>Please note this is an early release of the VSCode extension, so there will likely be bugs. If you get stuck, please raise an issue (<a href="https://github.com/infracost/vscode-infracost/issues" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/infracost/vscode-infracost/issues</a>), and we&#39;ll help you out asap.</p><p>We’d love to get your feedback on this extension, mainly what you think it’s missing and would help your workflow. Head over to the GitHub repo (<a href="https://github.com/infracost/vscode-infracost" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/infracost/vscode-infracost</a>) for more information and installation instructions.</p></div></div>
