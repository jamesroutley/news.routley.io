<h3 id="managing-your-storage-usage">Managing your Storage Usage</h3>
<p><strong>Q. What constitutes Storage usage?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. How can I view and manage my storage usage?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. What happens if I exceed my storage limits?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. How can I reduce the amount of Storage consumed?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pipeline job artifacts: You can set an <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.html#when-job-artifacts-are-deleted">expiration policy</a> for when artifacts can be deleted. You can also <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.html#delete-job-artifacts">delete job artifacts</a> manually - remember this can lead to data loss.</li>
<li>Repositories: Repositories can become large over time. You can reduce your repository size using the steps highlighted in the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/reducing_the_repo_size_using_git.html">documentation</a>.</li>
<li>Container Registry: You can set an <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/reduce_container_registry_storage.html#cleanup-policy">cleanup policy</a> to programmatically remove old, unused images and tags. You can also use the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/reduce_container_registry_storage.html">user interface or API</a>to delete items as well.</li>
<li>Packages: You can delete an <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/package_registry/reduce_package_registry_storage.html#delete-a-package">entire package</a> or <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/package_registry/reduce_package_registry_storage.html#delete-files-associated-with-a-package">files within a package</a></li>
<li>Dependency Proxy: You can set an <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/dependency_proxy/reduce_dependency_proxy_storage.html#cleanup-policies">expiration policy</a> to programmatically clear the cache. Or, you can manually <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/dependency_proxy/reduce_dependency_proxy_storage.html#use-the-api-to-clear-the-cache">purge the cache</a> using the API.</li>
<li>Snippets: Snippets follow the same process as <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/snippets.html#reduce-snippets-repository-size">reducing repository size</a>.</li>
<li>Wikis: Wikis follow the same process as <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/wikis/index.html#reduce-wiki-repository-size">reducing repository size</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: How can I automate storage usage analysis and cleanup?</strong>
A: You can use the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/">GitLab API</a> to programmatically view and delete storage data types. There are <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/partners/technology-partners/#api-clients">programming language libraries</a> available that can help with easy-to-use interfaces, for example listing and deleting job artifacts using the <a href="https://python-gitlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gl_objects/pipelines_and_jobs.html#jobs">Python library for GitLab</a>. A script based on the Python library has been developed by the GitLab Developer Evangelism team <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-de/gitlab-storage-analyzer">in this project</a>. This MIT-licensed script is not officially supported by GitLab and comes without warranty.</p>
<p><strong>Q. How will the storage limits affect me when I’m contributing to another project?</strong></p>
<h3 id="purchasing-additional-storage">Purchasing additional Storage</h3>
<p><strong>Q. How much does it cost to buy additional Storage units?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you require 15GB storage, you will pay $120 for the year.</li>
<li>If you have purchased 5 add-ons, you will be entitled to 50GB storage</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>

<li>Consider using a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/">self-managed instance</a> of GitLab which does not have these limits on the free tier.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_com/#purchase-more-storage-and-transfer">Purchase additional storage</a> units at $60/year for 10GB of storage.</li>

<h2 id="user-limits-on-gitlab-saas-free-tier">User Limits on GitLab SaaS Free Tier</h2>
<p><strong>Q. What is changing with user limits?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. Who do these changes apply to?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. Do these changes apply to Trials?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. Do these changes apply to public projects as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. What happens if I change the top-level visibility from private to public?</strong>
A. The namespace is <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/public_access.html">publicly visible</a>, this includes information such as members, issues, and merge requests. The namespace will be indexed by search engines.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Do these changes apply to private projects within a top-level namespace with public visibility?</strong>
A. User limits are currently applied based on the visibility of the top-level namespace. We will monitor how top-level namespaces with public visibility are using private projects to identify whether any limits on such projects are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Q. When are these changes effective?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. Will I be personally notified of the changes?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q. Can I apply for GitLab’s Open Source program with some public projects and some private projects in my group?</strong></p>

<li>All projects must be published under <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/category">OSI-approved open source licences</a>.</li>
<li>All projects must be within a group or a sub-group, you cannot apply for the program for projects within a personal namespace. (for example, consider a user <code>username</code>. Projects within the personal namespace <code>username</code> will not be considered. If <code>username</code> creates a group <code>user-group</code> and has open source projects within that group, then <code>user-group</code> can be considered for the Open Source program)</li>
<li>If you have projects unrelated to an <code>open source project</code> (for example, personal projects), you will need to move out the unrelated projects to a different group to be eligible for the GitLab for Open Source Program.</li>
