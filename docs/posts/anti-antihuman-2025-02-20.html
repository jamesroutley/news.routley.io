	<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Wrote two new simple posts since the last update:</p>
<p><a href="https://antiantihuman.com/the-work-about-nothing">https://antiantihuman.com/the-work-about-nothing</a>
<a href="https://antiantihuman.com/fake-analysis">https://antiantihuman.com/fake-analysis</a></p>
<p>As always those are my random reflections on various topics I think throughout the week.</p>
<p>Some personal notes: Iâ€™ve spend few days hanging out with friends in Baja California and 7 days in New York on a solo trip. Those posts were written on the road.</p>
<p>I also have new logo and new mascot. They are both already live here <a href="https://antiantihuman.com">https://antiantihuman.com</a>. Design is not important but wanted to give this blog some facelift. I think some extra tuning is needed.</p>
