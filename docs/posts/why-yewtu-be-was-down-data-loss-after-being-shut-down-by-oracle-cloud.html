    <article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto">On the 30th of June, my cloud provider, Oracle Cloud, decided to shutdown all my servers hosted on two Oracle Cloud accounts.</p>

<p dir="auto">Unfortunately and this is 100% my fault for forgetting that, I only had data duplication between servers located in the two Oracle Cloud accounts and no backups.</p>
<p dir="auto">Implementing some backup was something I had in my notes for a long time but I think I forgot about it, maybe due to the huge amount of work I spend on the open source projects.</p>
<p dir="auto">So as of now and in order to not have the responsability of keeping the data of my users somewhere safe I won&#39;t accept new registrations on yewtu.be. You can use yewtu.be normally like before but without an account.</p>

<p dir="auto">Well first I had to find new servers, set up them. I have a complex infrastructure for handling the many users that I receive every day.</p>
<p dir="auto">Second that was something I have wanted to do for a long time. Rework from scratch my infrastructure for an easier way of managing it.</p>
<p dir="auto">(Finally mentally recover from all of these events, especially the lost of my users data, by going on a hike for a full day)</p>
