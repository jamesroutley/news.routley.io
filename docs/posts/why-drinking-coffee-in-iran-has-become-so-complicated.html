  <p>It all started with a sarcastic jab in a chat:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p lang="fa" dir="rtl">آدم نباید کاسه‌ی داغ‌تر از آش بشه. می‌ری قهوه سفارش بدی یارو می‌گه از مزارع کنیا باشه یا برزیل؟ شبیه اینه بری ایتالیا قرمه‌سبزی بخوری یارو بهت بگه سبزیجاتش از مزارع بستان‌آباد باشه یا تویسرکان! انقدر ادا در نیارین تو رو خدا یه اسپرسو می‌خوایم بخوریم بریم دنبال زندگیمون :))</p>— Masoud (@imasoot)

<p>Funny, sure. But also painfully accurate.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-rewind">A quick rewind</h2>

<p>Coffee in Iran isn’t new—we were drinking it long before tea took over. Back in the Safavid era, coffeehouses were where people gathered for stories, debates, and a hit of something strong. No one was talking about “floral notes” or “single-origin beans.” Then came the Qajars, tea took the spotlight, and coffee faded into the background.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today, and coffee is back—but now it’s dressed like it’s trying to win an Oscar.</p>

<h2 id="these-new-cafés">These new cafés</h2>
<p>They’re not really about coffee anymore. They’re selling a lifestyle.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-deal">So, what’s the deal?</h2>
<p>Simple: it’s marketing.</p>

<p>By slapping fancy names and origin stories on every cup, cafés turn a basic drink into a status symbol. It’s capitalism playing dress-up as culture.</p>

<p>The irony? This whole coffee “culture” in Iran is barely out of diapers.</p>

<p>And don’t even get me started on the social media angle. That “Guatemalan cold brew” isn’t a drink—it’s content.</p>

<h2 id="whats-actually-driving-this">What’s actually driving this</h2>
<p>Us.</p>

<p>You’re not drinking coffee—you’re drinking the idea of being someone who drinks <em>that</em> coffee.</p>

<p>Sure, some might say this café trend is part of Iran’s growing urban culture. In places like Tehran and Isfahan, cafés are hubs now—for work, hangouts, even classes. But let’s not pretend it’s all deep and cultural. Most of it’s just a commercial stunt. A far cry from the old coffeehouses, where you got your drink, sat down, and lived your life—no fuss, no theatrics.</p>

<p>That friend’s rant hit the nail on the head.</p>

<h2 id="and-heres-the-real-kicker">And here’s the real kicker</h2>

<p>This whole thing isn’t going anywhere. Too many people are invested—baristas, café owners, influencers, even the customers who’ve built their personalities around “being into coffee.”</p>

<p>It’s too late to pull out. Their jobs, their status, their social media presence—all wrapped up in this coffee circus.</p>

<p>And the saddest part? It’s swallowing everything else. You want a decent, straightforward coffee? Good luck. You’re either getting a sad drip from a dusty corner shop or a 200,000-toman pour-over served with a side of self-importance.</p>

<p>That’s the real tragedy:</p>
