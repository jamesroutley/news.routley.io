        <p>Somehow, there is a claim of <a title="There&#39;s a 30-year mystery surrounding Microsoft&#39;s Blue Screen of Death" href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/blue-screen-of-death-computer-outage-hits-calif-19583943.php"> a 30-year mystery surrounding Microsoft’s Blue Screen of Death</a>. The argument goes that there are three conflicting sources of authorship: Steve Ballmer, John Vert, and me.</p>
<p>But really, there is no conflict. There are three different blue-colored screens, and each has a different author.</p>
<p>First is <a title="Who wrote the text for the Ctrl+Alt+Del dialog in Windows 3.1?" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140902-00/?p=93"> the Windows 3.1 <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd> screen</a>, which is a blue screen of unhappiness, not death:</p>

<p>The text for this message was written by Steve Ballmer. (He didn’t write the code to display the message; he just wrote the text that goes into the message.)</p>
<p>Windows 3.1 did not have a blue screen of death. If Windows crashed, you got <a title="Steve Ballmer did not write the text for the blue screen of death" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140909-00/?p=44123"> what could anachronistically be called a black screen of death</a>:</p>
<p>Could not continue running Windows because of paging error.</p>
<p>Next is the Windows 95 kernel error, which you could consider a “blue screen of death”, although Windows 95 lets you ignore the error, so it’s not a true death. (Then again, there’s no guarantee that ignoring the error will return you to a usable system.)</p>
<div>
 
<p><span> Windows </span></p>

<p>An exception 0D has occurred at 0028:80014812 in VxD CONTOSO(03) + 00000152. This was called from 0028:80014C34 in VxD CONTOSO(03) + 00000574. It may be possible to continue normally.</p>

<p>* Press any key to attempt to continue.</p>
<p>* Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to restart your computer. You will</p>
<p>  lose any unsaved information in all applications.</p>
</div>
<p>I was the one who brought this version of the Windows 95 kernel error blue screen message to its final form. (Some people have <a href="https://twitter.com/todayininfosec/status/1817285474462859497"> misidentified an early version of it as a Windows NT blue screen</a>.)</p>
<p>The third blue screen of death is the Windows NT kernel error, and <a title="Who implemented the Windows NT blue screen of death?" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170926-00/?p=97085"> that’s the one authored by John Vert</a>.</p>
<p>*** STOP: 0x00000019 (0x00000000,0xC00E0FF00xFFFFEFD4,0xC0000000)</p>
<p>This is a true “blue screen of death”: The system is unrecoverably dead at this point.</p>
<p>So we have the following table:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>OS</th>
<th>Author</th>
<th>Release year</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Windows 3.1</td>
<td>Steve Ballmer (text)</td>
<td>1992</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Windows 95</td>
<td>ends with me¹</td>
<td>1995</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Windows NT</td>
<td>John Vert</td>
<td>1993</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>¹ I did not write the early version of the Windows 95 blue screen message, but I was the one who brought it to its final form.</p>
