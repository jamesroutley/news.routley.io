</div><p>Listening to music by yourself might not seem like a social activity, but University at Buffalo researchers have published a study that suggests how doing so can have valuable social benefits.</p>


										      
																																	<p>&#34;It&#39;s a great way to give yourself a social boost and increase your well-being,&#34; says Elaine Paravati, Ph.D., the study&#39;s corresponding author, who conducted the research while completing her doctorate at UB.</p>
<p>Across two experiments for the study <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03057356241312219" target="_blank">published</a> in the journal <i>Psychology of Music</i>, Paravati and co-authors—Esha Naidu, Ph.D., a postdoctoral associate at Duke University, who was finishing her graduate work at UB at the time of the research; and Shira Gabriel, Ph.D., a UB professor of psychology—demonstrated how music functions as a social surrogate.</p>
<p>The study&#39;s perspective, however, differs from a lot of previous research on the social aspects of music, which often focus on how music brings people together, as listeners and performers.</p>
<p>Paravati instead looked at music enjoyed in isolation.</p>
<p>Humans have a fundamental need to belong, which strongly motivates our behavior. Failing to connect with others can lead to depression, anxiety and low self-esteem. There are traditional ways to fill this need, like spending time with family and friends, but there are non-traditional strategies as well, activities that might not be immediately recognized as social.</p>
<p>These are known as social surrogates, which can buffer against loneliness, isolation and social threats, like rejection, just as well as time spent with others.</p>
<p>Parasocial relationships, such as the one-sided bond between fans and celebrities, immersion into the social world, and reminders of others, are all social surrogates.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>&#34;Listening to music alone operates as a social surrogate along all three of those pathways,&#34; says Paravati. &#34;All of these paths can help us feel less lonely and more belonging. Music helps us feel connected to the artists; it can make us feel immersed in the world of music; and music can remind us of others.</p>
<p>&#34;You might think you&#39;re motivated to listen to your favorite song because you think it has a catchy beat, but it&#39;s likely that you&#39;re drawn in because that music is filling your social fuel tank and helping you feel a sense of belonging.&#34;</p>
<p>For the study&#39;s first experiment, researchers asked participants about their use of known social surrogates, such as favorite television shows, as well as their use of music.</p>
<p>&#34;We found that listening to one&#39;s favorite music helped individuals feel less lonely,&#34; says Paravati. &#34;But someone&#39;s favorite music was more effective at this than just listening to music in general.</p>
<p>&#34;In other words, there is something special about putting on your favorite song and jamming out.&#34;</p>
<p>For the second experiment, the researchers designed a test to measure the effectiveness of favorite music as a response to a social threat. Participants played a virtual ball-toss game often used for research on social exclusion.</p>
<p>&#34;Again, those who listened to their favorite music felt more belonging than those in the control condition, suggesting that listening to their favorite music buffered against the negative effects of a social threat.&#34;</p>
<p>Paravati says future research might explore the impact of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/music/" rel="tag">music</a> genre or the individual differences among the three surrogate pathways and which might be more important than the other two.</p>
<p>&#34;This work is another puzzle piece that shows how <a href="https://phys.org/tags/little+things/" rel="tag">little things</a> we do in our everyday lives help us to be as healthy and happy as possible,&#34; says Paravati.</p>
