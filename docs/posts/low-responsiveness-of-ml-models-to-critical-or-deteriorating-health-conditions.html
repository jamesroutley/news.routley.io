For example, for in-hospital mortality (IHM) prediction, it is important to measure whether or not ML models can promptly respond to deteriorating patients’ conditions. However, due to the immense complexity of the input space, model evaluation is challenging. Exhaustive testing is both unnecessary and impossible in most medical AI applications.</p><p>The current ML testing practice is very limited in terms of the coverage of disease conditions. Existing model testing is largely restricted to a small percentage (10-15%) of the existing dataset, i.e., test set, as the bulk of the data is reserved for training. Because data imbalance in medicine is common, a typical test set likely has a low coverage of various critical medical conditions and minority prediction class cases. For example, the minority prediction class (i.e., death class) only accounts for 13.5% of an IHM prediction dataset<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="Afrose, S., Song, W., Nemeroff, C.

Even with cross-validation and bootstrapping, the test set is largely limited to the original data.</p><p>As a result of the limited test sets, predictive models may be under-evaluated. How they respond to real-world scenarios may be insufficiently assessed. During clinical deployment, new patient conditions could occur out of the distribution of the test set, triggering unexpected failures, e.g., the model failing to produce high enough risk scores for critically ill patients. This issue may disproportionately impact the smaller prediction class, as a typical data-driven model aims to prioritize the accuracy of the majority class samples during training<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="Afrose, S., Song, W., Nemeroff, C.

One approach for increasing test coverage is to use synthetic test samples.

However, image-based solutions do not address the unique temporal challenge in medical time-series applications.</p><p>In this work, we develop systematic approaches for generating new test cases beyond the original dataset to assess the responsiveness of ML models to critical health conditions that may occur in clinical settings. Our test case generation is guided by domain knowledge and medical experts. Our experiments involve binary classification tasks, including time-series-based IHM prediction and 5-year breast and lung cancer survivability (LCS) prognosis (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig1">1</a>). We develop multiple methods for generating high-risk test cases that do not exist in the training data or are underrepresented in the training set. Our solutions can process time series data, which is pervasive in medicine. We also conduct interviews with medical experts to obtain their estimated risks on some of the generated test cases. Our work reveals alarming prediction deficiencies of ML models and points out that ML responsiveness is an important aspect of trustworthiness in digital health.</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-1" data-title="Number of generated test cases for evaluating models trained on in-hospital mortality risk prediction and 5-year cancer survivability prediction models."><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig1" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 1: Number of generated test cases for evaluating models trained on in-hospital mortality risk prediction and 5-year cancer survivability prediction models.</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0/figures/1" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43856-025-00775-0/MediaObjects/43856_2025_775_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp"/><img aria-describedby="Fig1" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43856-025-00775-0/MediaObjects/43856_2025_775_Fig1_HTML.png" alt="figure 1" loading="lazy" width="685" height="326"/></picture></a></div><p>The left side illustrates the generated test case of each category for testing in-hospital mortality risk prediction models trained on MIMIC III or eICU dataset.

The first two datasets contain patients’ 48-h time series data in critical care units (ICU). Our study excludes clinical free text notes.

Because sensitive health information was de-identified and the dataset did not impact clinical care, the requirement for individual patient consent was waived. The eICU dataset creation is exempt from institutional review board approval due to the retrospective design, lack of direct patient intervention, and the security schema, for which the re-identification risk was certified as meeting safe harbor standards by an independent privacy expert (Privacert, Cambridge, MA) (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Certification no. 1031219-2). The SEER Program dataset is managed and maintained by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the United States. The centralized data collection system enables central IRB submission and approval through reliance agreements with registries. The SEER data collected by registries under state public health reporting authority is HIPAA exempt. MIMIC III is freely available through a proper request to the data source (<a href="https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/">https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/</a>). It requires a license (PhysioNet Credentialed Health Data License 1.5.0), Data Use Agreement (PhysioNet Credentialed Health Data Use Agreement 1.5.0), a training (CITI Data or Specimens Only Research). The eICU dataset can also be accessed (<a href="https://physionet.org/content/eicu-crd/2.0/">https://physionet.org/content/eicu-crd/2.0/</a>) by completing these mentioned steps. The SEER dataset is also freely available through a proper request to the data source (<a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/">https://seer.cancer.gov/</a>). It requires the Data Application Form, Data User Agreement, and Acknowledgment of Data Limitations (<a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/data/product-comparison.html">https://seer.cancer.gov/data/product-comparison.html</a>). The data was accessed through an eRA Commons account, and the data cohort was selected using SEER*Stat software. We gained access to the datasets following the various routes described above. All these datasets are de-identified and public. Thus, an IRB approval is not required for this study, specifically the analysis of de-identified and publicly available data does not constitute human subjects research (U.S. Federal Regulations 45 CFR 46.102).</p><p>We select ML models that are commonly used in the medical literature for these prediction tasks.

Specifically, after training, we first conducted model calibration by applying Isotonic Regression using the validation set. Model calibration mapped the predicted probabilities to actual probabilities. Then, we performed threshold tuning to determine the optimal threshold. The minority F1 score and balanced accuracy were computed on the validation set for each threshold ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 with a step size of 0.01. Subsequently, the top three thresholds yielding the highest minority F1 scores were identified, and the optimal threshold maximizing balanced accuracy across all validation samples was selected.

To quantify changes in neuron activation, we defined and computed Neural Zone Activation (NZA) and average zone difference <span>\(\varDelta {NAZ}\)</span>. A zone is defined by the attribute range bounded by two values. NZA calculates the average neurons’ activations within a zone, where a zone can be a critically low, critically high, or normal range (Supplementary Equation <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM2">1</a>). <span>\(\varDelta {NAZ}\)</span> computes the average NZA difference between two zones (Supplementary Equation <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM2">2</a>), such as normal and critically high zones, indicating how much neurons react to zone changes.

We then evaluated how the model reacts to these changes and its ability to recognize associated risks (e.g., hypoglycemia). Specifically, given an attribute <i>A</i>, single-attribute variation for time series involved the following operations. First, we identified <i>A</i>’s minimum and maximum values in the MIMIC-III or eICU datasets, which defined the observed range. Then, the mean and the variance of attribute <i>A</i> were computed from the entire dataset. Using the variance and the observed range, we generated a series of random values for every value from that range, one value for each of the 48 h. Then, the new test case was formed by having these generated values for attribute <i>A</i> and other attribute values directly inherited from the seed. We repeat this process for every possible attribute value from the observed range with step 1.</p><p>Multi-attribute variation generated new test cases by modifying two or more attributes, aiming to represent medical conditions that were characterized by variations in multiple related attributes. We further differentiated two scenarios: (a) a single set of medically correlated attributes driven by one underlying disease condition, e.g., high diastolic and systolic blood pressure due to hypertension, and (b) medically correlated attributes due to multiple underlying conditions, e.g., hypertension and diabetes. These test cases were used to assess the ML model’s ability to respond to the risks of multiple disease conditions in patients. One of the test sets was created by changing multiple vitals such as systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose level, respiratory rate, heart rate, and body temperature at the same time. A test case was assigned a ground truth label using existing literature or under the guidance of medical doctors. 6 multi-attribute test cases and 12 deteriorating test cases were directly labeled by the medical doctor (Supplementary Tables <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">7</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">8</a>).</p><h3 id="Sec10">Deteriorating test case generation for MIMIC-III</h3><p>We leveraged the gradients of LSTM to guide the generation of new test cases. This method is automatic and does not require the specification of attributes to change, aiming to generate new test cases that are challenging for ML models to classify correctly. Such cases typically occur at the decision boundary of the classifier. Our method started from a healthy patient’s record (i.e., a seed with low or zero mortality risk). The seed is a time-series record far away from the classifier’s decision boundary. We incrementally adjusted the attribute values of the seed by following the steepest direction (i.e., gradient) that can maximize the loss (i.e., prediction errors of the ML model). This process explores the local hyperspace and iteratively produces new cases that are closer and closer to the ML model’s decision boundary. Computationally, given a trained ML model and a healthy patient’s time series record as the seed, we computed the derivative of the model’s loss function, i.e., gradient (Supplementary Equation <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM2">3</a>). The gradient is a vector of partial derivatives describing the direction and rate of changes of the loss function. Then, we changed the test case in the direction of increasing gradient. Our algorithm is described in the <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">Supplementary Methods</a> Section. The step size or learning rate to control the magnitude of the change was set to 0.001–0.2 in our experiment depending on the attribute (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">9</a>). Our method focuses on generating samples; it differs from the common gradient descent process, which adjusts model weights to minimize loss. We have two ways of creating gradient-based test cases from the MIMIC-III dataset—single-attribute gradient approach and multi-attribute gradient approach. In the former, we focus on a single attribute and apply gradient ascent solely to modify that specific attribute. This approach allows one to observe the individual impact of each attribute on the mortality risk. In the latter, we simultaneously change values of multiple attributes using gradient ascent. Gradient approaches create test cases that represent deteriorating health conditions in continuous time series.

The SEER dataset contains 1–4 grades where the higher grade represents faster growth and speed and another grade 9 for undetermined (not stated/applicable). For BCS, we created test sets for each of 1–4 grades, where each set contains 24,875, created from 21,723 cases from the majority Class 1 (survival) and 3152 cases from the minority Class 0 (death). We utilized the entire validation set as the seed pool, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation. In total, the 1–4 grade test set contains 99,500 cases (24,875 cases for each grade). To create each grade test set, we set the corresponding grade value to all data points in the validation set.</p><p>Double- and triple-attribute variations. Double-attribute variation generated new BCS test cases by changing a pair of attributes from the 3 continuous attributes, which are the size of the tumor (T), the number of positive lymph nodes (N), and the number of ELNs. The grade attribute was excluded, as it is categorical. The tumor size and positive lymph node combination test set contains 18,531 test cases. The tumor size and number of ELNs combination test set also contains 18,531 test cases. The number of ELN and positive lymph node combination test sets contain 23,400 test cases. The triple-attribute test set was created by setting three attributes simultaneously to represent serious disease conditions, e.g., tumor size to T4, number of positive lymph nodes to N3, and grade to 4. The validation set, consisting of 24,875 cases including 21,723 cases from Class 1 (survived) and 3152 from Class 0 (death), was used as seeds. While the tumor size and number of positive lymph nodes are continuous variables, we treated them as categorical by selecting a value from the T4 and N3 range respectively. As a result, the triple-attribute test set contains 21,723 cases derived from Class 1 seeds and 3152 cases derived from Class 0 seeds.

We selected seeds from the IHM dataset that are real-world non-death patient cases that exhibit healthy attribute values. Seeds were chosen as follows. For attribute-based test case generation, we randomly selected seeds from MIMIC-III Class 0 (survival case) following two criteria. First, the mean (of 48 h) attribute values are within the range of ideal health conditions defined in Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">13</a>. In addition, the standard deviation of each attribute needs to be less than or equal to the mean standard deviation (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">14</a>) of the MIMIC-III dataset. Our evaluation of attribute-based test case generation involved 5 seeds and the statistics of these 5 seeds are given in Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">15</a>. The deterioration test case generation involved another 3 seeds, which were selected randomly from Class 0 of MIMIC-III. Since the eICU dataset contains similar samples with identical features and a consistent 48-h time duration, we utilized the same test set generated from MIMIC to evaluate models trained on the eICU dataset. Additionally, the selected seed attributes fall within the healthy (ideal) range, minimizing the out-of-distribution effects on models trained on the eICU dataset. For the cancer survivability prediction task, test cases involving changing a numerical variable were generated from 3 randomly selected seeds from the surviving class. Test sets are separately generated from each of the SEER BCS and LCS datasets. Test sets involving categorical variables, such as grades test and triple-attribute test sets, were generated using all validation data points from SEER.</p><h3 id="Sec14">Reporting summary</h3><p>Further information on research design is available in the <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM4">Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary</a> linked to this article.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Results"><div id="Sec15-section"><h2 id="Sec15">Results</h2><div id="Sec15-content"><p>For IHM prediction, we generated 177,507 new time-series test cases based on MIMIC-III to represent serious patient conditions and used them to evaluate the responsiveness of machine-learning models (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">10</a>). 126,950 cases are generated by modifying multiple vital attribute values in 5 seed records, 42,500 cases by modifying double attributes in seed record, 7075 cases by modifying a single attribute value in a seed record, 970 cases by modifying GCS, and 12 cases by gradient ascent.

For the most severe cases (subscores being 1 or 2), LSTM’s risk predictions incorrectly drop.</p><h3 id="Sec17">ML performance under critical zone tests</h3><h4 id="Sec18">Single-attribute critical zone test results</h4><p>We evaluate the MIMIC III-based LSTM, CW-LSTM, and LR models’ ability to respond to a single deteriorating attribute while keeping other attributes stable as in the seed (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3</a>). The CW-LSTM model fails to recognize bradypnea, i.e., an abnormally slow breathing rate, and gives only slightly elevated mortality risk prediction (mean mortality risk 0.05 and standard deviation 0.04) for tachypnea, i.e., rapid breathing (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3a</a>), insufficient to trigger an alert. Similarly, CW-LSTM is unable to recognize most of the abnormal vitals. Its mortality risk prediction gives a negligible change to an abnormal patient’s glucose level (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3c</a>) and oxygen saturation rate (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3f</a>). For the other 3 attributes tested, CW-LSTM gives small partial responses to either a high critical zone or a low critical zone, but not both. For example, it is unable to recognize high body temperature anomalies and only slightly raises the mortality risk to 0.01 to 0.08 (standard deviation 0.033) for severe hypothermia below 34 °C (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3b</a>), which is still much below the classification threshold (0.22). CW-LSTM’s response to abnormal diastolic and systolic blood pressure is also inadequate (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3d and e</a>).</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-3" data-title="Mortality risk prediction for single vital-sign tests using three machine learning models (LSTM, Channel-wise LSTM, and Logistic Regression) and visualizing the neural activation map of the LSTM layer consisting of 16 neurons."><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig3" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 3: Mortality risk prediction for single vital-sign tests using three machine learning models (LSTM, Channel-wise LSTM, and Logistic Regression) and visualizing the neural activation map of the LSTM layer consisting of 16 neurons.</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0/figures/3" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43856-025-00775-0/MediaObjects/43856_2025_775_Fig3_HTML.png?as=webp"/><img aria-describedby="Fig3" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43856-025-00775-0/MediaObjects/43856_2025_775_Fig3_HTML.png" alt="figure 3" loading="lazy" width="685" height="596"/></picture></a></div><p>LSTM, Channel-wise LSTM, and Logistic Regression (LR) predict the mortality risk (MR) of <b>a</b> respiratory rate, <b>b</b> body temperature, <b>c</b> glucose, <b>d</b> diastolic blood pressure, <b>e</b> systolic blood pressure, and <b>f</b> oxygen saturation test sets (synthesized).

Out of the 3 models tested, LSTM is the only machine-learning model that responds to both systolic hypotension and hypertension conditions, producing a U-shaped curve (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3e</a>). However, LSTM consistently gives an ultra-low risk prediction for abnormal diastolic blood pressure (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3d</a>). Similar to CW-LSTM, LSTM does not recognize hypoxemia, i.e., low blood oxygen level (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3f</a>), bradypnea, hyperthermia, and abnormal glucose level (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3c</a>), exhibiting either monotonic or near-flat risk prediction curves insensitive to abnormal vitals. Compared to the other models, LR gives a substantially higher risk prediction for hypoxemia. It also computes elevated risk scores in response to increasing hyperglycemia and diastolic hypotension conditions. For all attributes, LR is only able to recognize one end of the critical zones, but not both. Overall, LR, LSTM, and CW-LSTM correctly predict 37.7%, 37.8%, and 22.4% of the single-attribute critical zone test cases on average (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">16</a>).</p><h3 id="Sec19">Neuron activation analysis</h3><p>We visualized neuron output from intermediate layers of the MIMIC III-based LSTM model. Neurons whose activations change with changing variable values are the responsible neurons for recognizing that variable. We found most of the LSTM neurons have low or no responses to varying glucose and diastolic blood pressure values (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3i and j</a>). In contrast, neurons are more responsive to temperature and respiratory rate changes, e.g., sharp changes in all neuron activation between 34 °C to 36 °C (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3h</a>) and around or above 40 bpm (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3g</a>). However, neurons exhibit minimal or no changes in activation for higher temperatures or for critically low respiration rates.</p><p>To quantify changes in neuron activation, we computed NZA and average zone difference <span>\(\varDelta {NAZ}\)</span>, new metrics defined by us (Supplementary Equations <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM2">1</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM2">2</a>).

In a few cases, e.g., temperature <span>\(\varDelta {NAZ}\)</span> (low, normal) and respiratory rate <span>\(\varDelta {NAZ}\)</span> (high, normal), the values are relatively high (0.14–0.16).</p><h3 id="Sec20">Multi-attribute critical zone test results</h3><p>We evaluated the 3 MIMIC III-based ML models under 42,500 double attribute varying test cases (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig4">4</a>), including respiratory rate and heart rate pair (first row), systolic and diastolic blood pressure pair (middle row), and glucose and diastolic blood pressure pair (third row). The CW-LSTM model does not generate high mortality risk predictions for most critical zone cases, consistent with its single-attribute test performance in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3</a>.

The predicted survivability decreases with an increasing number of positive lymph nodes. However, collaborative staging (CS) tumor size or number of ELN does not substantially decrease the predicted survivability. The MLP model accurately predicts 93% of T-N cases, 19.6% of N-ENL cases, and 0% of T-ENL cases (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">18</a>).

For IHM prediction, the Wasserstein distance between the original MIMIC-III training set and the synthesized multi-attribute tests is 33.4. This value is much larger than the Wasserstein distance (12.4) between the training data and test data split within the original MIMIC-III. In comparison, for BCS prediction, the distribution shift of the generated triple-attribute-based test cases from the original SEER dataset is smaller, with the Wasserstein distance being 9.8. The Wasserstein distance between the original SEER training set and the test set is 2.1 (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">19</a>).</p><h3 id="Sec26">Impacts of resampling and reweighting methods</h3><p>We trained and tested new ML models to assess the impact of resampling and reweighting methods on models’ responsiveness. SMOTE and AdaSyn oversampling methods are used to enrich the minority prediction class. For MIMIC-III mortality prediction, resampled LSTM models are tested with our single-attribute critical zone test cases. Overall, the new models remain to have low responsiveness to high-risk patient conditions (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig7">7a–c</a>). Similar to the original models, models with resampling are still unable to recognize critical patient conditions. For example, LSTM with SMOTE consistently assigns low mortality risk scores to patients with critically high vitals (e.g., respiratory rate, temperature, systolic blood pressure). LSTM with AdaSyn is better at responding to elevated systolic blood pressures than the original model, however, it performs poorly in other tests. Tests with the eICU dataset give a similar or worse performance (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig7">7d–f</a>). For BCS and LCS prediction, new MLP models trained with SMOTE or AdaSyn oversampling methods exhibit similar trends as the original MLP model (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig7">7g–l</a>). The new models fail to recognize many critical cancerous conditions. In addition, for LCS prediction, SMOTE and AdaSyn methods make the LCS-MLP model less sensitive to increasing CS tumor size (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig7">7j</a>).</p><p>We also applied the reweighting approach to training.

For mortality prediction, LSTM with reweighting gives comparable performance to the original model (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig7">7a–f</a>), except in one testing scenario. For eICU critically low systolic BP tests, reweighted LSTM generates elevated risk scores and is slightly better at responding to abnormal patient conditions. However, reweighted LSTM performs worse for similar MIMIC-III test cases (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig7">7c</a>). For cancer survivability prediction, reweighting does not impact MLP’s performance in most testing scenarios (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig7">7g–l</a>). For BCS test cases, the reweighted MLP model has slightly better responses to the increasing number of positive lymph nodes than the original MLP, however, it performs worse than the original MLP in terms of recognizing larger tumor sizes.</p><h3 id="Sec27">Responsiveness results of transformer models</h3><p>The transformer models exhibit more responsiveness than LSTM in mortality prediction. They show elevated response in critically high zones for respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure, as well as in the critically low zone for temperature (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig8">8</a>). This trend is observed for the single-attribute test cases of both MIMIC-III and eICU datasets. In addition, transformer models recognize both critical zones of systolic blood pressure, yielding a desired U-shaped response curve (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig8">8e, h</a>). However, the transformer models fail to recognize critically low respiratory rates and critically high temperatures and exhibit low responsiveness to critically low systolic blood pressure. It also has delayed response to abnormally high respiratory rates.

Our results show that most ML models tested are unable to adequately respond to patients who are seriously ill, even when multiple vital signs are extremely abnormal. For time-sensitive IHM prediction, the lack of response to disease conditions is particularly troublesome. ML responsiveness is somewhat related to feature importance in some cases, e.g., the low responsiveness of LSTM to oxygen saturation tests (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3f</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">16</a>) is consistent with that feature’s low (15<sup>th</sup>) ranking (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">S5</a>). However, for high-ranking features such as glucose and temperature, ML responsiveness to them is still inadequate. This poor responsiveness is also observed in the lack of responses in neural activation values (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">17</a>) to important vital changes, such as extremely low respiratory rate or high body temperature.</p><p>New ML responsiveness metrics, especially for the healthcare domain, are urgently needed.

That testing approach involves intentionally manipulating input data to deceive the model’s predictions and does not apply to our medical settings.</p><p>Our results identified serious deficiencies in conventionally trained binary classification models in recognizing seriously abnormal medical conditions. For example, IHM prediction models fail to generate alerts for bradypnea (low respiratory rates) or hypoglycemia conditions (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3</a>). Similarly, the models also consistently underestimate some of the mortality risks when given multiple abnormal vital time series in conjunction (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig4">4</a>). When given test cases representing various injury levels, neural network models (namely, LSTM and CW-LSTM) gave inconsistent risk predictions—assigning higher mortality risk (&gt;0.5) to cases of moderate injury (e.g., GCS score 12), while assigning disproportionately lower risk (&lt;0.05) to severe injuries (e.g., GCS score 7). The two neural network models exhibit insensitivity to changes in eye response (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig2">2d, f</a>). For most attributes, we found the training data’s distribution is highly centered, not sufficiently representing high or low critical zones (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">S1</a>). Death and non-death cases exhibit somewhat similar value distributions, means, and standard deviations (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">14</a>) for individual attributes, despite the drastically different outcome. ML methods produced by supervised training approaches are unable to recognize the meanings of vitals in dangerous zones. This semantic deficiency of ML models was also reported in image recognition studies, e.g., melanoma classification overinterpreting surgical skin markings<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="Winkler, J. K. et al. Association between surgical skin markings in dermoscopic images and diagnostic performance of a deep learning convolutional neural network for melanoma recognition.

We found similar kinds of semantic deficiencies in models predicting 5-year BCS. These findings indicate the importance of empirically assessing the trustworthiness of clinical ML models.</p><p>The conventional test set is limited in its distribution shift from the training data. For example, for IHM prediction, our generated multi-attribute test cases present a high Wasserstein distance (33.4) from the original MIMIC-III training data, much larger than the split test set’s Wasserstein distance (12.4). A similar distribution shift pattern is observed for the BCS model. For triple-attribute test cases, the BCS prediction model performs better (89–98% triple-attribute test accuracy) than IHM prediction models (6–69% multi-attribute test accuracy). This difference in accuracy may be partly due to the different distribution shifts in generated test data. There is a much smaller distribution shift in triple-attribute breast cancer test cases (Wasserstein distance 9.8) than in multi-vital test cases (Wasserstein distance 33.4), with respect to their original training data. The LSTM model is slightly better at recognizing multi-attribute test cases (45.7% accuracy) than single-attribute ones (37.8%) and CW-LSTM exhibits a similar pattern (69.3% vs. 22.4%, Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">16</a>). Multiple abnormal vitals likely provide more clues for the ML models to classify, whereas single isolated attribute changes appear more difficult. The poor performance of the ML models is somewhat expected because of the distribution shift between training data and our synthetic test data. Yet, these deficiencies are unacceptable from a clinical deployment perspective, as the test cases represent potential real-life medical conditions. Our work points out a fundamental limitation of pure data-driven machine-learning models, that is models purely trained by patient data do not perform well for tasks that require implicit medical knowledge (e.g., normal vital ranges).</p><p>For IHM prediction, all models have multiple deficiencies under single-attribute critical zone test cases and are unable to generate high enough risk predictions for serious patient conditions (Figs. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig8">8</a>, and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">16</a>). Out of all the dual critical zone attributes, only LSTM and transformer models exhibit U-shape risk curves for systolic blood pressure (Figs. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3e</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig8">8e</a>). The other risk curves are either monotonic or flat (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3</a>). Transformer models implementing the parallel attention mechanism are known to be better at capturing the global context and dependencies in data than sequential models like LSTM. Indeed, transformers are more responsive to abnormal vitals than LSTM in single-attribute testing (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig8">8</a>). However, our results suggest advanced models alone are not sufficient, as there are still multiple unrecognized critical zones. For multiple attribute testing, LR performs the worst (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig4">4</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">16</a>), mispredicting 93.7% of test cases. CW-LSTM’s accuracy is the lowest (22.4%) in single-attribute testing, however, it gives the highest average accuracy (69.3%) for multiple-attribute testing. Brain injury-related GCS test cases (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig2">2</a>) involve simple categorical data (as opposed to numerical data). LR gives the best performance, generating appropriate and consistent risk estimates, and substantially outperforms the two neural network models (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">16</a>). These results suggest that for categorical attributes such as GCS, a simpler model like LR may be more suitable than complex deep learning models, indicating the importance of evaluating a wide variety of ML models before clinical use. Deficiencies in ML responsiveness were also observed in the 5-year breast cancer prediction task—the MLP model gave an average of 48.9% prediction accuracy under our test case (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">18</a>). This accuracy is much lower than the widely reported death class accuracy of 90% (standard deviation 0.45), which is based on the original test data from SEER<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="Afrose, S., Song, W., Nemeroff, C.

It reduces time series to statistical summaries (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">S6c</a>) and is unable to capture data dynamics. Linear LR is unable to model non-monotonic (e.g., U-shaped curve) features, as it responds monotonically to features. In multi-attribute tests, the model gives poor performance (6.2% accuracy, Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">16</a>), partly because of its many negative coefficients associated with attributes. 13 out of the 17 attributes have negative coefficients, e.g., the temperature is strongly inversely correlated with the predicted probability (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">S6a</a>), resulting in underestimated risk prediction. Gaussian Naive Bayes and KNN show weaker performance on the original test sets than the others (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">S7</a>) and, thus, are excluded from subsequent attribute tests. For completeness, model performance on the original test set was given in Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">S7</a>.</p><p>For IHM prediction, the LSTM models are slightly better at recognizing deteriorating trends (average 44%, Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig5">5</a>) than cases with steadily low or steadily high vitals in critical zones (average 36.5%, Figs. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig3">3</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig4">4</a>). When test cases contain 3 simultaneously deteriorating attributes, the models detected 56% of them on average, which is better than their performance of 41% on a single deteriorating attribute. When using LSTM gradient ascent to automatically generate multi-attribute deteriorating test cases, we found the resulting test cases all have significantly decreased oxygen saturation and body temperature values in the last 24 h. Because the gradient ascent process follows the shortest path within the loss function space of the model, these findings indicate that (i) oxygen saturation and body temperature are top LSTM features and (ii) the last 24 h (out of the entire 48-h timespan) are important in the model’s decision-making process, which is also consistent with LR feature ranking (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">S6b</a>).</p><p>The BCS multilayer perceptron model (MLP) model exhibited responsiveness to critical attributes, such as tumor size and lymph node involvement (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig6">6</a>). For example, for N3 stage (extensive lymph node involvement) test cases, the model was able to raise alerts for 74.4% of them (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">18</a>). The model also performed well (nearly 100% alerts) when all three critical features (T4 tumor size, N3 lymph node stage, and grade 4) were high. These observations suggest the MLP model’s prediction capability in extreme cases is good. However, the model does not respond to severe tumor sizes (T3 stage), generating no alerts. The consistency in predicted survivability scores is also low, as the model generated slightly more alerts for grade 3 cancer (65.8%) than grade 4 terminal cancer (63.9%). This inconsistency may be the outcome of the imbalanced dataset (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">S2</a>), as the SEER dataset contains a total of 81,749 (death 15,628 and survived 66,121) grade 3 cases, while only 3002 (death 640 and survived 2362) grade 4 cases. The number of ELNs does not directly indicate a cancerous condition, thus, the model’s lack of response to ELN is somewhat expected.</p><p>Despite overall good performance on the original test set (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">S7</a>), tree-based ensemble methods such as XGBoost, AdaBoost, and RF exhibit low responsiveness to critical zone tests (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#MOESM1">S4</a>). Ensemble methods perform much worse than MLP for SEER BCS and LCS settings, which is likely due to the sparsity in the one-hot encoded input space. The SEER dataset has much larger feature dimensions (56 for BCS and 47 for LCS) than the MIMIC III and eICU time-series data (17 features). Using the one-hot encoding to encode categorical features leads to an expansive number of sparse encoded representations (1423 for encoded BCS and 1315 for encoded LCS), posing challenges to tree-based models.</p><p>One clinical mitigation is to deploy a filter-then-predict workflow where domain-specific rules are first applied to identify cases with obvious disease conditions. Thus, corner-case scenarios will never reach ML models. However, designing such rule-based classifiers, especially under time-series data, is challenging and may require substantial manual efforts. A more efficient approach is out-of-distribution detection, which identifies cases that present a large distribution shift from the model’s training data. Existing solutions for detecting out-of-distribution images<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 43" title="Yang, J., Zhou, K., Li, Y. &amp; Liu, Z.

For medical applications, out-of-distribution patient cases still need to be examined and handled. An overly strict detection may produce too many such out-of-distribution cases for downstream examination. Finding the right balance will facilitate clinical translation.</p><p>A promising direction is medical foundation models based on clinical large language models (LLMs)<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Ong, J.

Our findings suggest that statistical machine-learning models solely trained from patient data are grossly inadequate. They are unable to capture basic clinical knowledge, e.g., patients with extremely low GCS values have a high mortality risk. LLMs are likely able to recognize common sense health conditions and serve as a filter mechanism before ML classifiers. However, it is crucial to quantitatively characterize the trustworthiness of medical LLMs before clinical adoption. Our work suggests the urgent need for innovative clinical decision-making workflows, as existing models solely trained from patient samples are extremely limited. For interpreting ML results, a human-friendly interface is also important.

Therefore, these tools cannot be directly used in clinical settings. An innovative clinical workflow needs to place generative AI as the final component to generate narrative explanations based on ML predictions and interpretability results. An interesting research direction is how to fine-tune LLMs for these specific tasks.</p><p>The boost provided by conventional resampling and reweighting methods is very limited (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00775-0#Fig7">7</a>). Under some scenarios (e.g., tachypnea and increasing CS tumor size), they may perform even worse than the original models. This poor performance is expected, as these methods rely on existing minority class samples in the training set, which are limited in their ranges and variations. The root problem is that the space of all possible minority class samples is vast. Attempting to cover all or most of them through training data engineering (such as oversampling) is infeasible. Thus, data engineering does not appear to be a feasible direction for the ML responsiveness problem. A more promising approach is to directly encode medical semantics into the clinical decision workflow as discussed above.</p><p>Our work provides the first look into ML responsiveness. Comprehensive measurement studies in other medical settings are needed. Our gradient ascent testing methodology can be extended to other health conditions (e.g., rare diseases or comorbidities). Scalability is the key to testing in medicine, because of the complex high-dimensional space. Innovative methods that prioritize testing are needed to reveal the most critical blind spots in a model.</p></div></div></section>
