    <h1>Mistral Releases Deep Research, Voice, Projects in Le Chat</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p dir="ltr">AI assistants are at their best when they let you go deeper in your thinking, keep your conversation flowing, and maintain contextual continuity. Today, we’re making Le Chat even more capable, more intuitive — and more fun — with a collection of powerful new features to help you research more thoroughly, express yourself more naturally, and keep your interactions — text, voice, and images — organized in context.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Dive deeper with Deep Research.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Research mode turns Le Chat into a coordinated research assistant that can plan, clarify your needs, search, and synthesize. Ask a meaty question, and it will break it down, gather credible sources, and build a structured, reference-backed report that’s easy to follow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s powered by our tool-augmented Deep Research agent (in preview), but designed to feel simple, transparent, and genuinely helpful, as though you’re collaborating with a well-organized research partner.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Le Chat is all ears.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Vocal mode lets you talk to Le Chat just like you’d talk to a person — no typing needed. You can brainstorm ideas while walking, get quick answers while running errands, or transcribe a meeting. It’s powered by our new voice-in model, Voxtral, and built for natural, low-latency speech recognition, that keeps up at your pace.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Thinking it through, in your language.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Think mode helps you reason through complex questions with clear, thoughtful answers, powered by our reasoning model — Magistral. Great for drafting a proposal in Spanish, clarifying a legal concept in Japanese, or just thinking things through in whatever language you’re most comfortable with. Le Chat can also code switch between languages mid-sentence. </p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Where Projects take shape.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Projects help you stay organized by grouping related chats into focused, context-rich spaces. Each project has its own default Library and remembers which tools and settings you’ve enabled, so things stay the way you left them. You can upload files directly into a project, pull in content from your Libraries, and keep everything — conversations, documents, and ideas — in one place. Perfect for planning a move, designing a new product feature, or keeping long-running workstreams on track.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Picture it — then edit it.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Unlike with typical text-to-image tools, you can create and then edit your images with simple prompts like “remove the object” or “place me in another city” and the model transforms the scene while preserving characters and detail. It’s ideal for making consistent edits across a series, keeping people, objects, and design elements recognizable from one image to the next.</p>
