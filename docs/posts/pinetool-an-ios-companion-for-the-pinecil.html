    <h1>Show HN: PineTool ‚Äì An iOS Companion for the Pinecil</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6448319330"><img loading="lazy" width="120" height="40" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://lachy.io/_next/static/media/appstore.a2e763b8.svg"/></a></p><p>The Pinecil is a $25 soldering iron from PINE64 that runs off any USB-C charging brick. It ºs a surprisingly capable unit with performance that punches well above its price. (My wonderful Hakko FX-888D has seen little use since the Pinecil arrived!)</p>
<p>Internally it uses a BL706 RISC-V microcontroller from Bouffalo Lab, running the open-source <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Ralim/IronOS">IronOS</a> firmware. The BL706 has a built-in Bluetooth Low Energy radio, and last week IronOS 2.21 was released adding BLE capability.</p>
<p>I thought I ºd have a crack at building a companion app for this new capability<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>, and here ºs what I ºve come up with:</p>
<figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cj1oc8nAriE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>I promise that I ºm usually pretty good at soldering‚Äîjust not when looking through a camera üòÖ</figcaption></figure>
<p>PineTool displays live data from the iron and can configure its temperature setpoint. I ºve found it much more ergonomic than using the two-button interface on the device.</p>
<p>Is this unnecessary? Absolutely. But I figure that there ºs a good overlap between those who use open source RISC-V soldering irons, and those who would enjoy pretty live temperature and power charts while soldering üòÅ.</p>
<p>PineTool is available for free on the <a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6448319330">App Store</a> today and the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lachlanbell/PineTool">source code is on GitHub</a>.</p>
