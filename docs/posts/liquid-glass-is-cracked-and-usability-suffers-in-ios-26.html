    <h1>Liquid Glass Is Cracked, and Usability Suffers in iOS 26</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>
                  Summary: 
                </span>iOS 26’s visual language obscures content instead of letting it take the spotlight. New (but not always better) design patterns replace established conventions.
              </p><div>
              <p>With iOS 26, Apple seems to be leaning harder into visual design and decorative UI effects — but at what cost to usability? At first glance, the system looks fluid and modern. But try to use it, and soon those shimmering surfaces and animated controls start to get in the way. Let’s strip back the frost and look at how these changes affect real use.</p>
<h2 id="toc-liquid-glass-apples-new-visual-language-1">Liquid Glass: Apple’s New Visual Language</h2>
<p>iOS 26 introduces Apple’s new <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/glassmorphism/">glassmorphic</a> visual language into its phones.</p>
<p>Apple describes Liquid Glass as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a translucent material that reflects and refracts its surroundings, while dynamically transforming to help bring greater focus to content, delivering a new level of vitality across controls, navigation, app icons, widgets, and more.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translated: the interface now ripples and shimmers as if your phone were encased in Jell-O. At first glance, it does look cool. But problems arise as soon as you start using your phone.</p>
<h3>Transparency = Hard to See</h3>
<p>Liquid Glass makes UI elements translucent and bubbly. The result is light, airy — and often invisible.</p>
<p>One of the oldest findings in usability is that anything placed on top of something else becomes harder to see. Yet here we are, in 2025, with Apple proudly obscuring text, icons, and controls by making them transparent and placing them on top of busy backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/text-over-images/">Text on top of images</a> is a bad idea</strong> because the contrast between the text and the background is often too low. So <em>why</em> does Apple now encourage users to set photos as backgrounds for text messages?</p>
<figure><img alt="Text messages of butterflies placed over a background of a rabbit, making it hard to decipher any image. " height="761" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/1-messages-img_2023.PNG" width="350"/>
<figcaption><em>Apple Messages: iOS 26 encourages users to choose a background image for text messages. Doing so makes it substantially harder to read the text or easily notice other content, such as photos. Or even discover the input field (not to speak of the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/">in-field placeholder</a> </em>iMessage).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The result is that your friend’s words are camouflaged against their beach-vacation photo, or worse, their pet’s fur. Content may technically be “in focus,” but you can’t read (or see) it.</p>
<figure><img alt="Icons at the bottom of a restaurant page on Apple Maps blend into the background images of food. " height="761" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/2-maps.PNG" width="350"/>
<figcaption><em>Apple Maps: Icons at the bottom of the screen blend in with the images in the background, despite the blurring of the background.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And then comes Apple’s boldest (or dumbest) experiment: <strong>text on top of text. </strong>Apparently, designers decided users have eagle vision and infinite patience, because deciphering one line of text written across another is now fair game. Reading an email subject line now requires Dan Brown-level cryptographic decoder skills.</p>
<p>Not only is it illegible — it’s also ugly.</p>
<figure><img alt="The search bar on the Mail app blends into the previews for other emails. " height="254" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/3-mail.PNG" width="350"/>
<figcaption> <em>Mail: Text on top of text creates an illegible mess.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Semitransparent floating controls reign in iOS 26. Titles, search bars, tab bars, and even the phone status bar are now floating on top of the page. These not only obscure the page content, but also sometimes compete for attention with other page elements.</p>
<figure><img alt="The controls on Safari now blend in with the page content on Illinois Tolls." height="761" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/4-illinois.PNG" width="350"/>
<figcaption><em>Safari: The browser’s floating controls (URL bar, back button, ellipsis menu) now compete for attention with in-page floating buttons. And the phone&#39;s ​​​​​status bar interferes with in-page content.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Animated Buttons: Motion Without Meaning</h3>
<p>Animation can be delightful the first time. When used intentionally, they can also be satisfying — creating that feeling when something just “clicks” or “snaps” into place. Our eyes are finely tuned to detect motion, which is why animated buttons grab attention instantly. But delight turns into distraction on the tenth, twentieth, or hundredth time.</p>
<p>In iOS 26, controls insist on animating themselves, whether or not the user benefits. Carousel dots quietly morph into the word <em>Search</em> after a few seconds. Camera buttons jerk slightly when tapped. Tab bars bubble and wiggle when switching views, and buttons briefly pulsate before being replaced with something else entirely. <strong>It’s like the interface is shouting “look at me” when it should quietly step aside and let the real star — the content — take the spotlight.</strong></p>
<figure><img alt="On an iPhone homescreen, the search bar and carousel dots transform into each other as the user scrolls. " height="762" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/homescreen.gif" width="350"/>
<figcaption><em>Homescreen: The carousel dots change into a search bar.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img alt="When selecting tabs on the phone app, the selected tab shimmers and wiggles in a bubble." height="106" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/voicemail.gif" width="350"/>
<figcaption><em>Tabs shimmer, bubble, and wiggle when switched.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img alt="When selecting a button in the Contacts app, the button pulse and wiggle to indicate selection." height="194" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/contacts.gif" width="350"/>
<figcaption><em>Buttons pulsate when selected.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Even controls you didn’t touch can’t resist showing off. In the Phone app, switching from <em>All Calls</em> to <em>Missed Calls</em> mysteriously turns the filter button blue, as though missed calls deserve filtering but all calls don’t.</p>
<figure><img alt="When switching to a tab that also filters selections, the filter button turns blue, although it wasn&#39;t selected." height="212" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/phone-filter.gif" width="350"/>
<figcaption><em>Phone: Switching from </em>All<em> to </em>Missed Calls<em> turns the filter button blue, likely to indicate that a filter was applied and only some calls — the missed ones — are visible. The intention is good, but the change of color is unnecessary and distracting, given the selected state of the segmented control</em> Missed<em> at the top. Or perhaps the designers were afraid that the selected state was too subtle?</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Music app, the current song title ticks along like a stock-market ticker, shimmering with watery highlights as you scroll up and down. Reach the top of the page and — surprise! — the bubble leaps up to make space for the tab bar<strong>. </strong></p>
<figure><img alt="As the user scrolls down, the pill with the song title jumps up and a tab bar slides under it. " height="762" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/music.gif" width="350"/>
<figcaption><em>Apple Music: The song title ticks and shimmers, and jumps up to make room for the tab bar when the user scrolls up to the top of the page.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Motion for motion’s sake is not usability. It’s distraction with a side of nausea.</p>
<h2 id="toc-crowded-smaller-tap-targets-2">Crowded, Smaller Tap Targets</h2>
<p>Apple has also decided it’s time to crowd and shrink touch targets. The long‑standing guideline of at least 0.4cm between targets (and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/touch-target-size/">1cm × 1cm tap areas</a>) seems to have been tossed out the window. Either <strong>Apple believes our fingers are getting smaller, </strong>or it assumes years of practice with smartphones have magically trained us to hit tiny targets with perfect precision.</p>
<figure><img alt="Comparison between the photos app in different iOSs&#39;. The older one&#39;s controls are spaced further apart. " height="718" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/photos.png" width="692"/>
<figcaption><em>Photos: In iOS 18 (left)  controls are much farther apart than in iOS 26 (right).</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In iOS 26, tab bars show the results of this thinking: they feel cramped, squeezed to make room for the ever present search button that lingers in the bottom‑right corner of nearly every page.</p>
<figure><img alt="Comparison between the app store in the old and new iOS design. The new iOS visually splits the search into a seperate pill pushing the other icons closer together." height="730" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/app-store.png" width="692"/>
<figcaption><em>App Store in iOS 18 vs iOS 26: In iOS 26 (right) the tab bar at the bottom of app pages has become split between navigation and search — with search taking a larger space and navigation categories being crammed into each other.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Because this button hovers apart from the rest of the bar, navigation feels fragmented. One control floats off on its own while the others are bunched together, breaking the sense of a unified control area and making the whole bar harder to scan at a glance. <strong>The heavy emphasis on search feels borrowed from Google’s playbook,</strong> which is ironic given Apple’s reputation for building its own distinct design language.</p>
<h2 id="toc-predictability-lost-3">Predictability, Lost</h2>
<p>We’ve long known that constantly changing interfaces are a nightmare. Back in the day, Microsoft Office experimented with adaptive menus that reordered themselves based on recency. People hated them because nothing stayed where you left it. You had to rescan the menu every single time. The interface could not be learned because it was constantly changing.</p>
<p>Apple seems to have learned nothing from that lesson. In iOS 26, controls appear, vanish, collapse, and expand depending on context. The tab bar collapses whenever search is activated, making room for the field.</p>
<figure><img alt="When the search bar is clicked, the bar with the tabs &#34;summary&#34; and &#34;sharing&#34; shrink into a single icon. " height="762" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/health-nav-bar.gif" width="350"/>
<figcaption><em>Health: The tab bar collapses whenever the search box is expanded.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Safari adds its own twist: the forward button appears and disappears depending on whether there is a page to go forward to. While this may seem logical in theory, in practice it disrupts consistency: changing the size and location of a target makes the interface harder to learn and less predictable.</p>
<figure><img alt="Two screenshots of the new Safari design. In one image there is only a back button, the second image features both a back and forward button in the controls. " height="729" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/safari-forward.PNG" width="692"/>
<figcaption><em>Safari: The browser toolbar sometimes contains only a back button (left), and sometimes it also includes a forward button (right).</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Instead of building reliable habits, users now have to play hide-and-seek with the navigation controls.</p>
<h2 id="toc-changing-conventions-4">Changing Conventions</h2>
<p>Search in earlier versions of iOS lived at the top of the page. In Mail or Messages, users had to scroll down to reveal the bar. It wasn’t the most discoverable pattern, but years of repetition made it second nature.</p>
<figure><img alt="A screenshot showing the old iOS design. It shows that the search bar was hidden by default, but would appear at the top if the user scrolled up." height="714" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/messages-ios18.PNG" width="692"/>
<figcaption><em>Messages (iOS 18): Search was hidden by default (left). To access it, users had to “pull down” the top of the page (right).</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, in iOS 26, search has migrated to the bottom of the screen and is always visible. For newcomers this might feel easier to find, but for long‑time users it’s a jarring break from habit that slows them down until the new pattern becomes ingrained. (Even if the new pattern might prove beneficial over time, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/power-law-learning/">existing users must relearn it</a>, which in the short run means lost productivity and added frustration.)</p>
<figure><img alt="Comparison of the old and new iOS designs. In the old one, the search bar is at the top. The new one has it at the bottom." height="740" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/settings-search.PNG" width="698"/>
<figcaption><em>Settings app: Search is at the top in iOS 18 (left) and at the bottom in iOS 26 (right).</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To complicate matters further, search is styled as a floating bar that sometimes interferes with page content. Its pale design also tends to fade into the background, making it easy to miss. In our past research on floating buttons, we found they work best when they stand out clearly — not when they blend in and risk being overlooked.</p>
<h2 id="toc-discoverability-in-decline-5">Discoverability in Decline</h2>
<p>The back button, once a friendly guide accompanied by a breadcrumb, has lost its trail. Instead of showing where you came from, it has no label now, leaving users to guess.</p>
<figure><img alt="Comparison of the old and new iOS. In the old one, the back button was a blue back arrow with &#34;Settings&#34; written beside it. In the new one, it is just a black-and-white back arrow icon." height="717" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/settings-general.PNG" width="692"/>
<figcaption><em>Settings: The back button used to have a breadcrumb next to it, indicating the page the user came from (left). In iOS 26 (right), that label has been removed.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This signals another transition (this time for the worse) to Android-style design, where page titles are left-aligned (instead of center-aligned), thus displacing the breadcrumb next to the back button. This design choice has the potential to cause major confusion for users, as some apps will still use a breadcrumb next to the back button, while others may replace the breadcrumb with the current-page title.</p>
<figure><img alt="A screenshot of the new App Store showing that the back button appears to have the current page&#39;s title next to it." height="761" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/ratings.PNG" width="350"/>
<figcaption><em>App Store: The current page’s title </em>Ratings and Reviews<em> takes the place of the iOS 16 back-button breadcrumb.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Safari piles on with its own frustrations: the URL bar is squeezed between icons, truncated to the point where you can’t easily tell what site you’re on. And tabs, once a single tap away, are now hidden in an overflow ellipsis menu that demands extra steps. Not only does this design violate best practices for overflow menu (which requires that only nonessential actions be hidden there), but every additional tap is another second wasted — multiplied by the millions of times users switch tabs each day.</p>
<figure><img alt="Screenshot of the new Safari design showing the url bar cuts off the first half of a URL making it hard to tell what site you&#39;re on." height="761" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/chezpanisse.PNG" width="350"/>

<h2 id="toc-the-bigger-picture-6">The Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>iOS 26 brings Liquid Glass controls laid over noisy backgrounds, jittery animated buttons, shrunken and crowded tab bars, collapsing navigation, and ubiquitous search bars. On top of that, it breaks long‑established iOS conventions, getting closer to Android design.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, Apple is prioritizing spectacle over usability</strong>, lending credibility to the theory that Liquid Glass is an attempt to distract customers from iOS 26’s lack of long-promised AI features.</p>
<p>The interface is restless, needy, less predictable, less legible, and constantly pulling focus rather than supporting seamless access to content. Instead of smoothing the path for everyday tasks, iOS 26 makes users relearn basics while enduring a constant parade of visual stunts.</p>
<p>Apple may call it Liquid Glass. To many users, it feels more like a fogged‑up window: pretty from a distance, but frustrating when you try to see beyond it.</p>
