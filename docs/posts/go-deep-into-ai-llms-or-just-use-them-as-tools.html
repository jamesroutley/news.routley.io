    <h1>Ask HN: Go deep into AI/LLMs or just use them as tools?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m a software engineer with a solid full-stack background and web development. With all the noise around LLMs and AI, I’m undecided between two paths:</p><p>1. Invest time in learning the internals of AI/LLMs, maybe even switching fields and working on them</p><p>2. Continue focusing on what I’m good at, like building polished web apps and treat AI as just another tool in my toolbox</p><p>I’m mostly trying to cut through the hype. Is this another bubble that might burst or consolidate into fewer jobs long-term? Or is it a shift that’s worth betting a pivot on?</p><p>Curious how others are approaching this—especially folks who’ve made a similar decision recently.</p></div></div></div>
