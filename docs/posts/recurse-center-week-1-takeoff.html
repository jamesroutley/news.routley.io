<p>This is an attempt to collect all the things I’ve learned, worked on, and experienced during my time at RC.</p>
<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Introductions and onboarding</li>
<li>Met a lot of passionate, kind and wonderful people. Everyone had exciting backgrounds and projects they are going to work on.</li>
<li>As expected, there were many Rustaceans and wannabes.</li>
<li>Russell Webb’s Neural Network with Rust caught my eye and I am going to spend some time understanding it and learn Rust and NN in the process.</li>
<li>For now, I have decided to spend my first week at RC meeting people, exploring different arenas, get started with pair programming and go with the flow.</li>
<li>I have to also make a more concrete plan on learning Rust and diving into Databases.</li>
<li>I am looking forward to attending the Rust, System Design and DDIA study groups.</li>
<li>Overall, this was a great start and I have high hopes for the coming weeks. Let’s go!</li>
</ul>
