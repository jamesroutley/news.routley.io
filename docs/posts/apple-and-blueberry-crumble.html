<p><span id="more-21397"></span>We had the pleasure of dining with Investment Banker Friend and King&#8217;s College Boy several times this past week, as the latter came to attend his graduation. There are of course too many recipes to write up, as I eat faster than I can write. I am giving the recipe to what I thought was a very fine apple crumble from this evening&#8217;s dinner.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t make crumbles much although it is always my dessert of choice if a restaurant offers it. I think the reason is that it doesn&#8217;t keep very well, unlike a cake. Even trying to move the leftovers from the baking tray to a storage bowl messed up the structure somewhat.</p>

<p>Once you master the basic crumble recipe it is easy to substitute the apples for other types of fruit: pear and chocolate, rhubarb and ginger, plum and apple. Tonight I made it with Bramley apples and blueberries.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Crumble:</p>
<p>150 g plain flour</p>
<p>50 g whole oats</p>
<p>100 g unsalted butter, cold, cut into cubes</p>
<p>50 g Demerara sugar</p>
<p>large pinch of fine sea salt</p>
<p>575 g eating apples, peeled and cored weight</p>
<p>125 g blueberries</p>
<p>50 g golden caster sugar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to Make:</p>
<p>First make the crumble.</p>
<p>Place the flour, oats and butter in a mixing bowl. Rub the mixture together in between your fingertips. You are aiming for a light breadcrumb texture, but some clumping is ok to create crunchy clusters when the crumble is baked.</p>
<p>Add in the sugar and salt, using a spoon to lightly combine the crumble mixture. Set aside in the fridge until needed.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180 C / 160 C fan whilst you are making the filling.</p>
<p>Cube the apples and place directly into the baking tin (20 cm x 20 cm). Add the blueberries and sugar.</p>
<p>Top with the crumble mixture and bake in the oven for 45 minutes or until the crumble looks brown and crunchy. Serve with warm vanilla custard.</p>

<p>For a more challenging dessert, try the <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2021/07/apple-crumble-cake/">Apple Crumble Cake.</a> For Christmas try the <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2021/01/mincemeat-crumble-and-custard/">Mincemeat Crumble</a>. For real indulgence try the <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2021/01/mincemeat-crumble-and-custard/">Pear and Chocolate Crumble</a>.Â We are off to Devon for the weekend, where I aim to take in some fresh country air, eat a few nice meals, do some reading and write up more recipes. I am almost certain that a Crumble will feature in one of the restaurants we are visiting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post Script:</p>
<p>We ate the leftover crumble for a quick breakfast before leaving for Devon. It was delicious, warming and everything you would want in a good breakfast: fruit, oats, milk and eggs.</p>
