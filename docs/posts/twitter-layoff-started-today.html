        <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/twitter?trk=public_post_share-update_update-text" data-tracking-control-name="public_post_share-update_update-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a> layoffs started today. 

There are people losing their jobs that have been there over a decade. 

This is a really tough day. 

In addition, there is a current blackout on selling any Vested Stock. 

It began on May 31st and the brokerage that holds the stock has no end date.

So- in addition to losing their jobs, which Twitter assured employees would not happen, many of these folks wonâ€™t be able to sell the shares they earned.

The money they need pay bills and keep them afloat if and until they get new employment. 

When severance ends, thatâ€™s it. 

If Twitter has chosen to spend potential billions suing Elon and maintaining a falsely inflated stock price at the expense of the people who gave their lives building the companyâ€” that is an even more tragic story. 

I wish everyone at Twitter well and please reach out if I can refer you to anyone in my network.

Ps donâ€™t worry about me, I accepted a new position last week and am sooooo excited about it. More ðŸ”œ
