For reasons that escape me there seems to a trend for standby lights on home electronics to be blue &#34;searchlights&#34;.
This &#34;feature&#34; is especially annoying when the electronics are in a bedroom or the home is a one room flat for that matter.  Some
manufacturers helpfully allow these to be turned on, but not all, and not on the <a href="http://www.jvc.co.uk/">JVC</a> LT-39C740
I recently bought from <a href="http://www.currys.co.uk">Currys</a>.
</p><p>
 A bit of black will fix the problem but often, like on the LT-39C740, the
same window for the blue light is also the window for the remote control sensor so the black tape solution also disables the
remote control.  However, with a bit a lateral thinking there is a solution.  Remote controls use infra-red so adding a filter to allow
infra-red only is another solution.  The trend for using blue LEDs helps now.  A red filter will likely extend down to infra-red
but certainly block blue light.
</p><p>
Luckily Quality Street chocolates have a transparent wrapper that is a nice deep red.  I found that 2 layers
of this still allowed the remote control to work from across the room while reducing the blue light to near zero.  Pulled tight
around the square block that contains the blue LED and remote sensor and secured with a bit of sellotape round the back, out of sight,
the fix is near invisible.  Only the very observant would notice the the square block that contains the blue LED and remote sensor
is purple black rather than the same black as the rest of the plastic surround.
</p><p>
A free fix and you get to eat the chocolate.  What could be better?
