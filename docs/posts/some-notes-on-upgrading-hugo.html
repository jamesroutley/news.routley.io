    <h1>Some notes on upgrading Hugo</h1>
    
    <p>Warning: this is a post about very boring yakshaving, probably only of interest
to people who are trying to upgrade Hugo from a very old version to a new
version. But what are blogs for if not documenting one&rsquo;s very boring yakshaves
from time to time?</p>
<p>So yesterday I decided to try to upgrade Hugo. There&rsquo;s no real reason to do
this &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been using Hugo version 0.40 to generate this blog since 2018, it
works fine, and I don&rsquo;t have any problems with it. But I thought &ndash; maybe it
won&rsquo;t be as hard as I think, and I kind of like a tedious computer task sometimes!</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d document what I learned along the way in case it&rsquo;s useful to
anyone else doing this very specific migration. I upgraded from Hugo v0.40
(from 2018) to v0.135 (from 2024).</p>
<p>Here are most of the changes I had to make:</p>
<h3 id="change-1-template-theme-partials-thing-html-is-now-partial-thing-html">change 1: <code>template &quot;theme/partials/thing.html</code> is now <code>partial thing.html</code></h3>
<p>I had to replace a bunch of instances of <code>{{ template &quot;theme/partials/header.html&quot; . }}</code> with <code>{{ partial &quot;header.html&quot; . }}</code>.</p>
<p>This happened in <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.42">v0.42</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have now virtualized the filesystems for project and theme files. This
makes everything simpler, faster and more powerful. But it also means that
template lookups on the form {{ template “theme/partials/pagination.html” .
}} will not work anymore. That syntax has never been documented, so it&rsquo;s not
expected to be in wide use.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="change-2-data-pages-is-now-site-regularpages">change 2: <code>.Data.Pages</code> is now <code>site.RegularPages</code></h3>
<p>This seems to be discussed in the <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.57.2">release notes for 0.57.2</a></p>
<p>I just needed to replace <code>.Data.Pages</code> with <code>site.RegularPages</code> in the template on the homepage as well as in my RSS feed template.</p>
<h3 id="change-3-next-and-prev-got-flipped">change 3:  <code>.Next</code> and <code>.Prev</code> got flipped</h3>
<p>I had this comment in the part of my theme where I link to the next/previous blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;next&rdquo; and &ldquo;previous&rdquo; in hugo apparently mean the opposite of what I&rsquo;d think
they&rsquo;d mean intuitively. I&rsquo;d expect &ldquo;next&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;in the future&rdquo; and
&ldquo;previous&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;in the past&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s the opposite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks they changed this in
<a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/ad705aac0649fa3102f7639bc4db65d45e108ee2">ad705aac064</a>
so that &ldquo;next&rdquo; actually is in the future and &ldquo;prev&rdquo; actually is in the past. I
definitely find the new behaviour more intuitive.</p>
<h3 id="downloading-the-hugo-changelogs-with-a-script">downloading the Hugo changelogs with a script</h3>
<p>Figuring out why/when all of these changes happened was a little difficult. I
ended up hacking together a bash script to <a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/dbe4bd9271a56f1f8562bfe329c2aa9e">download all of the changelogs from github as text files</a>, which I
could then grep to try to figure out what happened. It turns out it&rsquo;s pretty
easy to get all of the changelogs from the GitHub API.</p>
<p>So far everything was not so bad &ndash; there was also a change around taxonomies
that&rsquo;s I can&rsquo;t quite explain, but it was all pretty manageable, but then we got
to the really tough one: the markdown renderer.</p>
<h3 id="change-4-the-markdown-renderer-blackfriday-goldmark">change 4: the markdown renderer (blackfriday -&gt; goldmark)</h3>
<p>The blackfriday markdown renderer (which was previously the default) was removed in <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.100.0">v0.100.0</a>. This seems pretty reasonable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been deprecated for a long time, its v1 version is not maintained
anymore, and there are many known issues. Goldmark should be a mature
replacement by now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fixing all my Markdown changes was a huge pain &ndash; I ended up having to update
80 different Markdown files (out of 700) so that they would render properly, and I&rsquo;m not totally sure</p>
<h3 id="why-bother-switching-renderers">why bother switching renderers?</h3>
<p>The obvious question here is &ndash; why bother even trying to upgrade Hugo at all
if I have to switch Markdown renderers?
My old site was running totally fine and I think it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a <em>good</em>
use of time, but the one reason I think it might be useful in the future is
that the new renderer (goldmark) uses the <a href="https://commonmark.org/">CommonMark markdown standard</a>, which I&rsquo;m hoping will be somewhat
more futureproof. So maybe I won&rsquo;t have to go through this again? We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Also it turned out that the new Goldmark renderer does fix some problems I had
(but didn&rsquo;t know that I had) with smart quotes and how lists/blockquotes
interact.</p>
<h3 id="finding-all-the-markdown-problems-the-process">finding all the Markdown problems: the process</h3>
<p>The hard part of this Markdown change was even figuring out what changed.
Almost all of the problems (including #2 and #3 above) just silently broke the
site, they didn&rsquo;t cause any errors or anything. So I had to diff the HTML to
hunt them down.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I ended up doing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate the site with the old version, put it in <code>public_old</code></li>
<li>Generate the new version, put it in <code>public</code></li>
<li>Diff every single HTML file in <code>public/</code> and <code>public_old</code> with <a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/c7272cfb906e3ed0a3e9f8d361c5b5fc">this diff.sh script</a> and put the results in a <code>diffs/</code> folder</li>
<li>Run variations on <code>find diffs -type f | xargs cat | grep -C 5 '(31m|32m)' | less -r</code> over and over again to look at every single change until I found something that seemed wrong</li>
<li>Update the Markdown to fix the problem</li>
<li>Repeat until everything seemed okay</li>
</ol>
<p>(the <code>grep 31m|32m</code> thing is searching for red/green text in the diff)</p>
<p>This was very time consuming but it was a little bit fun for some reason so I
kept doing it until it seemed like nothing too horrible was left.</p>
<h3 id="the-new-markdown-rules">the new markdown rules</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of every type of Markdown change I had to make. It&rsquo;s very
possible these are all extremely specific to me but it took me a long time to
figure them all out so maybe this will be helpful to one other person who finds
this in the future.</p>
<h4 id="4-1-mixing-html-and-markdown">4.1: mixing HTML and markdown</h4>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t work anymore (it doesn&rsquo;t expand the link):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;small&gt;
[a link](https://example.com)
&lt;/small&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I need to do this instead:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;small&gt;

[a link](https://example.com)

&lt;/small&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This works too:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;small&gt; [a link](https://example.com) &lt;/small&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="4-2-is-changed-into">4.2: <code>&lt;&lt;</code> is changed into «</h4>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want this so I needed to configure:</p>
<pre><code>markup:
  goldmark:
    extensions:
      typographer:
        leftAngleQuote: '&amp;lt;&amp;lt;'
        rightAngleQuote: '&amp;gt;&amp;gt;'
</code></pre>
<h4 id="4-3-nested-lists-sometimes-need-4-space-indents">4.3: nested lists sometimes need 4 space indents</h4>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t render as a nested list anymore if I only indent by 2 spaces, I need to put 4 spaces.</p>
<pre><code>1. a
  * b
  * c
2. b
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that the amount of indent needed depends on the size of the list
markers. <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#example-263">Here&rsquo;s a reference in CommonMark for this</a>.</p>
<h4 id="4-4-blockquotes-inside-lists-work-better">4.4: blockquotes inside lists work better</h4>
<p>Previously the <code>&gt; quote</code> here didn&rsquo;t render as a blockquote, and with the new renderer it does.</p>
<pre><code>* something
&gt; quote
* something else
</code></pre>
<p>I found a bunch of Markdown that had been kind of broken (which I hadn&rsquo;t
noticed) that works better with the new renderer, and this is an example of
that.</p>
<p>Lists inside blockquotes also seem to work better.</p>
<h4 id="4-5-headings-inside-lists">4.5: headings inside lists</h4>
<p>Previously this didn&rsquo;t render as a heading, but now it does. So I needed to
replace the <code>#</code> with <code>&amp;num;</code>.</p>
<pre><code>* # passengers: 20
</code></pre>
<h4 id="4-6-or-1-at-the-beginning-of-the-line-makes-it-a-list">4.6:  <code>+</code> or <code>1)</code> at the beginning of the line makes it a list</h4>
<p>I had something which looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>`1 / (1
+ exp(-1)) = 0.73`
</code></pre>
<p>With Blackfriday it rendered like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 / (1
+ exp(-1)) = 0.73&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and with Goldmark it rendered like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;`1 / (1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exp(-1)) = 0.73`&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Same thing if there was an accidental <code>1)</code> at the beginning of a line, like in this Markdown snippet</p>
<pre><code>I set up a small Hadoop cluster (1 master, 2 workers, replication set to 
1) on 
</code></pre>
<p>To fix this I just had to rewrap the line so that the <code>+</code> wasn&rsquo;t the first character.</p>
<p>The Markdown is formatted this way because I wrap my Markdown to 80 characters
a lot and the wrapping isn&rsquo;t very context sensitive.</p>
<h4 id="4-7-no-more-smart-quotes-in-code-blocks">4.7: no more smart quotes in code blocks</h4>
<p>There were a bunch of places where the old renderer (Blackfriday) was doing
unwanted things in code blocks like replacing <code>...</code> with <code>…</code> or replacing
quotes with smart quotes. I hadn&rsquo;t realized this was happening and I was very
happy to have it fixed.</p>
<h4 id="4-8-better-quote-management">4.8: better quote management</h4>
<p>The way this gets rendered got better:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Oh, *interesting*!&quot;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>old: “Oh, <em>interesting</em>!“</li>
<li>new: “Oh, <em>interesting</em>!”</li>
</ul>
<p>Before there were two left smart quotes, now the quotes match.</p>
<h4 id="4-9-images-are-no-longer-wrapped-in-a-p-tag">4.9: images are no longer wrapped in a <code>p</code> tag</h4>
<p>Previously if I had an image like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/rustboot1.png&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>it would get wrapped in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, now it doesn&rsquo;t anymore. I dealt with this
just by adding a <code>margin-bottom: 0.75em</code> to images in the CSS, hopefully
that&rsquo;ll make them display well enough.</p>
<h4 id="4-10-br-is-now-wrapped-in-a-p-tag">4.10: <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is now wrapped in a <code>p</code> tag</h4>
<p>Previously this wouldn&rsquo;t get wrapped in a <code>p</code> tag, but now it seems to:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I just gave up on fixing this though and resigned myself to maybe having some
extra space in some cases. Maybe I&rsquo;ll try to fix it later if I feel like
another yakshave.</p>
<h4 id="4-11-some-more-goldmark-settings">4.11: some more goldmark settings</h4>
<p>I also needed to</p>
<ul>
<li>turn off code highlighting (because it wasn&rsquo;t working properly and I didn&rsquo;t have it before anyway)</li>
<li>use the old &ldquo;blackfriday&rdquo; method to generate heading IDs so they didn&rsquo;t change</li>
<li>allow raw HTML in my markdown</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I needed to add to my <code>config.yaml</code> to do all that:</p>
<pre><code>markup:
  highlight:
    codeFences: false
  goldmark:
    renderer:
      unsafe: true
    parser:
      autoHeadingIDType: blackfriday
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll try to get syntax highlighting working one day, who knows. I might
prefer having it off though.</p>
<h3 id="a-little-script-to-compare-blackfriday-and-goldmark">a little script to compare blackfriday and goldmark</h3>
<p>I also wrote a little program to compare the Blackfriday and Goldmark output
for various markdown snippets, <a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/9cc3024ff98433ced5e3a2304c5fc5e4">here it is in a gist</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really configured the exact same way Blackfriday and Goldmark were in
my Hugo versions, but it was still helpful to have to help me understand what
was going on.</p>
<h3 id="a-quick-note-on-maintaining-themes">a quick note on maintaining themes</h3>
<p>My approach to themes in Hugo has been:</p>
<ol>
<li>pay someone to make a nice design for the site (for example wizardzines.com was designed by <a href="https://melody.dev/">Melody Starling</a>)</li>
<li>use a totally custom theme</li>
<li>commit that theme to the same Github repo as the site</li>
</ol>
<p>So I just need to edit the theme files to fix any problems. Also I wrote a lot
of the theme myself so I&rsquo;m pretty familiar with how it works.</p>
<p>Relying on someone else to keep a theme updated feels kind of scary to me, I
think if I were using a third-party theme I&rsquo;d just copy the code into my site&rsquo;s
github repo and then maintain it myself.</p>
<h3 id="which-static-site-generators-have-better-backwards-compatibility">which static site generators have better backwards compatibility?</h3>
<p>I <a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/113260718682453232">asked on Mastodon</a> if
anyone had used a static site generator with good backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>The main answers seemed to be Jekyll and 11ty. Several people said they&rsquo;d been
using Jekyll for 10 years without any issues, and 11ty says it has
<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/blog/stability/">stability as a core goal</a>.</p>
<p>I think a big factor in how appealing Jekyll/11ty are is how easy it is for you
to maintain a working Ruby / Node environment on your computer: part of the
reason I stopped using Jekyll was that I got tired of having to maintain a
working Ruby installation. But I imagine this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem for a Ruby
or Node developer.</p>
<p>Several people said that they don&rsquo;t build their Jekyll site locally at all &ndash;
they just use GitHub Pages to build it.</p>
<h3 id="that-s-it">that&rsquo;s it!</h3>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;ve been happy with Hugo &ndash; I <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/10/09/switching-to-hugo/">started using it</a> because it had fast
build times and it was a static binary, and both of those things are still
extremely useful to me. I might have spent 10 hours on this upgrade, but I&rsquo;ve
probably spent 1000+ hours writing blog posts without thinking about Hugo at
all so that seems like an extremely reasonable ratio.</p>
<p>I find it hard to be too mad about the backwards incompatible changes, most of
them were quite a long time ago, Hugo does a great job of making their old
releases available so you can use the old release if you want, and the most
difficult one is removing support for the <code>blackfriday</code> Markdown renderer in
favour of using something CommonMark-compliant which seems pretty reasonable to
me even if it is a huge pain.</p>
<p>But it did take a long time and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d particularly recommend moving
700 blog posts to a new Markdown renderer unless you&rsquo;re really in the mood for
a lot of computer suffering for some reason.</p>
<p>The new renderer did fix a bunch of problems so I think overall it might be a
good thing, even if I&rsquo;ll have to remember to make 2 changes to how I write
Markdown (4.1 and 4.3).</p>
<p>Also I&rsquo;m still using Hugo 0.54 for <a href="https://wizardzines.com">https://wizardzines.com</a> so maybe these notes
will be useful to Future Me if I ever feel like upgrading Hugo for that site.</p>
<p>Hopefully I didn&rsquo;t break too many things on the blog by doing this, let me know
if you see anything broken!</p>
