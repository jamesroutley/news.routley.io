    <h1>Tell HN: Cloudflare verification is breaking the internet</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Across many different pages including science journals, ChatGPT, and many others, CloudFlare verification goes into an infinite loop of:</p><p>1. &#34;Verify you are a human&#34;</p><p>2. Check the box or perform some other type of rain dance</p><p>3. &#34;Please stand by, while we are checking your browser...&#34;</p><p>4. Repeat step 1</p><p>I&#39;m on Fedora Linux 37 using Firefox 110.</p><p>The workaround is to use Chrome.</p><p>After experiencing this dozens of times and getting annoyed of needing to use Chrome, I finally went and deleted all my cookies and cache which I had been dreading to do.</p><p>It did not help.</p><p>I don&#39;t have a CloudFlare account so I wrote up a detailed post on their community forums. I offered a HAR file and was willing to do diagnostics. It received no responses and it was auto-closed.</p><p>It&#39;s unacceptable that CloudFlare is breaking the internet while offering no community support.</p><p>Edit: I&#39;m in Texas. I&#39;m not using a VPN or Tor, just AT&amp;T Fiber. I don&#39;t have ad-blockers. No weird extensions. Nothing special (besides being on Linux).</p><p>Edit2: Since this got traction, I opened a new community post: https://community.cloudflare.com/t/infinite-verify-you-are-a-human-loop/503065</p><p>To be clear, I&#39;m not against CloudFlare doing DDoS protection, etc., but it can&#39;t be breaking the internet <i>while ignoring community posts on it</i>.</p><p>Edit3: The CloudFlare team has engaged. Thank you HN!</p></div></div></div>
