    <h1>Tell HN: GitHub is partially blocked in India</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>GitHub is being partially blocked in India by a prominent ISP (ACT) across multiple states under a sealed court order.</p><p>You can find multiple reports here: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Github%20%40actfibernet" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/search?q=Github%20%40actfibernet</a>. It has shown up in news reports: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/github-content-domain-blocked-for-these-indian-users-reports/articleshow/96687992.cms" rel="nofollow">https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/github-cont...</a></p><p>ACT is using SNI-sniffing to block raw.githubusercontent, unlike most other blocks, which are DNS based. ACT&#39;s block page claims it is under a court order to block the domain:</p><p>&gt; curl <a href="http://raw.githubusercontent.com/" rel="nofollow">http://raw.githubusercontent.com/</a></p><p>&gt; This URL has been blocked under the instructions in compliance with the orders of a Hon&#39;ble Court.</p><p>(Using HTTPS results in a dropped connection).</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no easy way to find out if there is even a court order behind this block. A few times court orders are leaked, and a court case to get a single order published took 3 years[0] . Other ISPs are known to block websites without court-order due to technical issues[1]</p><p>for the last few weeks, GitHub previews on the website have refused to load, alongside some other interesting cases, such as extension previews breaking on VS Code (, Obsidian etc).</p><p>Hopefully, GitHub is fighting a case to get this unblocked, and given the resources it has, to challenge the law here as well (the law gives no recourse as it stands).</p><p>[0]: <a href="https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-directs-meity-to-provide-a-copy-of-the-blocking-order-and-a-post-decisional-hearing-to-mr-tanul-thakur-whattheblock/" rel="nofollow">https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-directs-meity-to-provide...</a></p><p>[1]: <a href="https://github.com/captn3m0/hello-cloudflare/">https://github.com/captn3m0/hello-cloudflare/</a></p></div></div></div>
